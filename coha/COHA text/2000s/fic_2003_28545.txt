" I 'm sorry Trey sold the house to a stranger , " Ann Corrigan said as she hooked her foot under a rung of her bar stool at the counter of the Wolf River Caf . " Not that I really blame him . What else could he do ? " " Two years on the market without a nibble . I guess he could have burned it down and collected the insurance , " Bernice Jones answered . She ran a clean rag over the counter . " You want breakfast ? " " Just some iced tea , please . I would have bought the place myself if I had the money and could afford to fix it up . " " What would you do with a big place like that ? " Bernice shook her head , picked up a mason jar , filled it with ice and tea , then set it down in front of Ann . " It 's about ready to fall down . Trey jumped at that fool 's offer , do n't you think he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't you have any lemon ? " " If you 'll hold your horses , I 'll cut you some . The tea 's barely had time to steep . " Bernice reached for a wicked-looking paring knife , picked up a lemon and began slicing it with speed and accuracy . " Bet you could n't get iced tea this time of the morning up in Buffalo , could you ? " " Half the time I could n't get iced tea in the middle of the day up there . They have this weird idea that iced tea is for hot weatherand never for breakfast . And they never even heard of sweet tea . " " Ought to be glad you finished that job and got yourself back down south . You must be sick of blizzards . " " I spent so much time restoring the proscenium arch in that old theater I did n't much care about the weather outside . I do not want to see any more gold leaf for a while . " " Not much of that next door at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sliced lemons on the counter . " Be better if it collapsed on its own , except it would probably fall on the caf and kill us all . " Ann speared two pieces of lemon , squeezed them into her tea , then added a couple of packets of artificial sweetener . " Why are you so down on the place ? " " Everybody who ever lived in that mansion was miserable . Some houses are just unhappy from the get-go . You mark my words . That Frenchman has bought himself a heap of trouble . " Bernice looked past Ann 's shoulder . " Hold your horses , boys . I 'll be there with the coffee in a second . " She picked up the big pot and wended her way through the tables occupied nearly every morning by the same group of local farmers indulging in a second breakfast . When Bernice set the coffeepot back on the warmer , Ann said , " I was happy there . Sometimes after my piano lesson Aunt Addy and I would have lemonade and homemade macaroons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got into the restoration business . Every time I see an old building fallen on hard times , I just ache to make it glow again . " " Huh . That house has n't done much glowing in my lifetime . " " I hoped if it stayed on the market long enough , maybe Trey would donate it to the town for a museum . Endow it , restore it - something . " " What does an itty-bitty town like Rossiter , Tennessee , need with a museum ? " Bernice waved a hand at the walls of the caf , which were hung with yellowed newspaper clippings going back nearly a hundred years . " This is as close as Rossiter gets to a museum . It 's not like that old house was built before the war . " Ann knew the war in question was the Late Unpleasantness between North and South . Other wars were spoken of as World or Korean or Desert Storm . " I hate to admit this , but I used to swan down that staircase and pretend I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have looked all lit up for the cotillions and parties . " " At least Trey sold the house to somebody who 's got the money to fix it up . And you got you a job close to home into the bargain . You met the new owner yet ? That Frenchman ? " " Nope . Daddy 's supposed to be meeting him this morning to set up the schedule for the renovations . I might not see him for weeks if he commutes from New Jersey . And Daddy says he 's not French . " Bernice leaned her elbow on the counter and rested her cheek on her hand . " What I want to know , " she whispered , " is why some bachelor would buy that old house in a little town like this and spend a bunch of money on it . " Ann shrugged . " Daddy says he used to be an airline pilot . He got hurt and ca n't fly big planes any longer . Maybe he 's buddies with some of the pilots who 've redone the antebellum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house from them . " " Those pilots fly out of Memphis , so they have to live close by , and they 've got families and more money than sense . He 's just some guy who showed up out of the blue , bought the place in five minutes and hired your daddy to fix it . " She shook her head . " I 'm surprised he did n't try to turn it into apartments or maybe tear it down and build something else - not that the town would let anybody do that to a historic property . " She nodded her head sagely . " They say he 's retired . " It sounded like an accusation . " So ? " Ann asked . " Lots of men retire early . " " Not that early . According to Lorene Hoddle , he 's no more than thirty-five or - six . I tell you , Ann , there 's something strange about it . " " Oh , come on , Bernice . You think he 's going to set up a crack house or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Ann , you and your daddy take care not to do all that work and let him skedaddle without paying you . " " Daddy 's checked out his credit references . He 's got the money to pay us , and most people do n't run out owing the chief of police money . " She considered . " Gangsters would n't set up drug operations or prostitution in a town of 350 souls , most of whom are kin and all of whom know one another 's business . Why drive way out here from Memphis to sin ? And with legal gambling just south of the border in Mississippi , he 'd hardly be likely to open an illegal casino in west Tennessee . " " Well , just you wait . There 's something not right about it . " Bernice refilled Ann 's glass . " I thought he might be one of those professional decorators - you know , like Patsy 's boy Calvin that went away to New Orleans - him not being married and all , but Lorene says he seems real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you play your cards right ... " Ann laughed into her tea so hard she sputtered . " Bernice , one minute you 're convinced he 's a drug dealer , the next you 're telling me to go after the poor man . No , no and no . " " Why not ? You been divorced almost two years . You 're too young not to get married again , have some babies . " " Bernice , I love you , but I 'm not looking for another handsome man - certainly not one who 's retired , as you say , at thirty-five , and definitely not one who bought my family 's old homeplace . He 'll be my client for as long as it takes to finish the Delaney mansion , then I 'm off to restore something else . I 've got good reason to know that good-looking men tend to think the rules do n't apply to them . " ( Continues ... )                   @ @
