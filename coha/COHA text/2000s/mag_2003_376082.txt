Two years after the Twin Towers fell , nearly 7 in 10 Americans remain convinced that Saddam Hussein played a part in the Sept. 11 attacks  --  despite the fact that no evidence has been found of such a role . Critics of the Bush Administration charge that the President and his top advisers waged a subtle campaign of insinuation in trying to make the case for war by frequently mentioning Sept. 11 and Saddam in the same breath  --  while carefully acknowledging , when pressed , that there was no specific link between the two . Critics had another reason to howl last week when Vice President Dick Cheney , appearing on Meet the Press , muddied the waters yet again . Cheney said that although two years ago he said there was no link between Saddam and Sept. 11 , new evidence about Saddam 's links to al-Qaeda has led him to update his position : " We do n't know " if Saddam was involved in the Sept. 11 attacks . That prompted a quick response from Administration brass to reiterate the official White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Bush , " that Saddam Hussein was involved with Sept. 11 . " Administration officials insisted , however , that Cheney had not strayed from the official script but was merely restating the more general point that Saddam had al-Qaeda ties . <P> Even that assertion has become a source of tension on the House Intelligence Committee , which is probing the handling of prewar intelligence on Iraq . At a closed hearing last week , a knowledgeable source tells TIME , Democrat Silvestre Reyes read into the record a secret memo he sent Republican chairman Porter Goss more than a month before the war . Reyes ( who , through an aide , declined comment ) raised concerns that intelligence agencies may have misled the panel by suddenly touting links between Iraq and al-Qaeda . Reyes told the panel that in closed-door testimony over the previous year , intelligence witnesses , when asked if there was any evidence of such links , had consistently said there was " none , or very little if we stretch it .
