Last April we sent a note to Ms. Lee 's professors at Cornell , asking them to ease up on her coursework so she 'll have more time to write her elegant tales . Said note seems to have had no effect , but Yoon Ha Lee still manages to find time in her studies to craft new stories such as the sf adventure that follows . This story marks her third appearance here in as many years and we look forward to continuing this trend well into the future . <p> KENDRA KNEW WITH EVERY pulse of her blood what the people of Liadhe remembered best about Sharadon Brent : his steady eyes and pale hair and shining medals , hero of battles past .. the scandal when he left Liadhe after the war to become a mercenary , wandering among foreign stars . Warmonger , they called him now , the man who loved bloodshed so deeply he abandoned his home in peacetime . It was different for her . She remembered instead his strong hands drawing chord after chord , descant after shimmering descant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requiring human hands to sing . Years ago Kendra had listened drowsily while Sharadon Brent tuned the seven strings , adjusted the frets , serenaded the night . His voice haunted her , too : as quiet in song as in speech , yet she had ached for it later , after they called him to the war against Veretys . Even today , in her faltering and tuneless way , she could hum his oldtime ayres and ballads . Sometimes , while flying patrol with her taciturn ghost Falcon in the unvanquished night between Liadhe 's burning stars , she wondered what it would have been like to serve military duty during wartime . At crossover points , where her wing 's circuit met another 's , they still danced the pointwise duel : ship against nimble ship , lances dimmed to a caress of coherent light , to third strike rather than destruction . She found a beauty in the duello , **27;0;TOOLONG , and told herself that killing had no place in this pleasure . Yet Kendra wondered if her father had felt differently . Her father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war 's end , and so she had never had a chance to ask . When last you lingered by the burning city , When you saw my eyes were parched of pity , I thought that you surely should depart ; I thought I no longer held your heart . They pulled her from patrol duty unexpectedly , without warning ; and so Kendra left her ship , the Nightcry , at the starport Spindance , making her way past the sleek , silent cradles of docked needleships to the scarred Mirror 's Edge . She swallowed her apprehension long enough to say , " Sharadon Kendra reporting for duty . " Most veterans had left military service after the war , and Kendra had met few of those who remained , let alone a legend . The hatch slid open . " Edge acknowledges . Pleased to have you , Kendra , " replied the ship 's ghost in a surprisingly mild tenor . Then again , an AI could choose any voice it pleased . " We 're to receive orders shortly . " Kendra nodded her thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her quarters . They were spartan , stripped of personality or luxury , as befitted a wartime vessel . " Do you know what this is about ? " she asked Edge . She did not need to mention that she had originally been assigned with Falcon of the Nightcry to border patrol ; Edge had access to the records . Highly unusual , that a young wingsecond should be promoted or requested to partner such an experienced ship . Kendra thought with a pang of Falcon , now obliged to accustom itself to a new partner , but she must follow where duty led her . " Not precisely , " said Edge , " but one might find some significance in the fact that I once partnered your father . " She frowned , studying the instrument panels , the deck , they stared back blandly . Sharadon Brent had left Liadhe twelve years ago , as time was measured on a world called Liadhe's-heart , with nary a visit home . Kendra remembered envying the ghosts who had spent time with him , bound by battlefield necessity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If I may ask - how well did you know him ? " " Well enough , before he was transferred to the Doppelganger . " After an uneasy pause , the ghost said , " Incoming call . " Kendra made her way to the command console and its communications array . " I 'm ready . " A woman 's face blazed into color on the screen . She raised a hand in greeting . " Carredas Maro , " she said without stating rank or position . " Edge , ship 's ghost . " Kendra raised her hand as well . " Sharadon Kendra - " Her voice faltered . " Wingsecond on special duty , " Edge filled in . " Fortunate that you chose to continue military service last year , Kendra , " said Mayo , lowering her hand . " Had you not  --  " Kendra followed suit . " Had I not , you would have sought me out , and I would still be here . " The woman smiled faintly . " True . As you may have guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was exiled a long time ago . " " Given an exile 's status two days after they discovered he left , " Edge corrected politely , with a ghost 's concern for accuracy . Maro nodded . " Yes . He has put us in a difficult situation . " " ' Us ' ? " asked Kendra . " Liadhe , then . If there 's a difference . " She was silent . Then : " On what authority did you pull me into this ? , This time it was the woman 's turn to pause , and she picked her words carefully . " Even exiles are , in the end , children of Liadhe . It does n't matter how far they stray , how long they stay in foreign space . There are those of us charged with watching over them . They are Liadhen , and we do n't abandon our own . " " No , but what if they abandon you ? " She had not meant to reveal so much of her heart in one question , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would that it were so easy , " said Mayo . " What they do concerns us all . " " Details , madam , " Edge said . " Details . " Kendra searched the woman 's serene face . She knew Mayo must stand very high indeed , if she was authorized to deal with exiles yet shrouded herself in obscurity . For the first time Kendra contemplated the idea of authority whose limits depended only on its wielder 's restraint ; who could check power that was silent and unseen ? She shook away the thought . There must be silent , unseen levels of restraint as well . " Since the treaty we have been at peace with Veretys , " said Mayo , " and there has been no trouble between our peoples . Not long ago , however , several mercenary companies - and mercenary independents - were hired by the governors of the Faienga League . " Kendra frowned , trying to remember where she had heard of Faienga . " That 's border space , is n't it ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last I heard , " the ghost said . Maro sighed . " It should n't have affected you , or any other Liadhen . An internal matter , really : after an odd decade of agitating , the Faiengis finally revolted . " " One of the independents was Sharadon Brent , then , " said Kendra . " Yes . " " And Veretys is unhappy that a Liadhen , exiled though he be , is in Faienga 's hire , " Edge said flatly . Maro 's eyebrows quirked . " A conservative estimate of the situation . The Veretane contend-not entirely without justification-that Sharadon Brent 's interference constitutes a violation of the treaty . " Kendra studied the space between the woman 's brows , where there was no wrinkle of worry . Even so , she knew there were communications protocols that smoothed expressions and tones into unbroken composure or carefully calculated concern before transmission . There was no way to tell from her end . " They know he 's an exile . " " They also know that Liadhe never abandons her own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would have been wiser to refuse the contract , no matter what Faienga offered . " Reluctantly , Kendra nodded : best the battle never set ablaze , said one of her father 's favorite ballads . Favorite no longer , she feared . " You 're assuming he was an ordinary mercenary with ordinary motives , " Edge pointed out . " No matter what else he was , what else he became , Brent was rarely .. ordinary . Besides , he must be making a difference , or the Veretane would hardly bother pointing to the treaty . " " What are our orders ? " Kendra asked . " Find him , " Maro said , lips pressing tight . " Find him and convince him to stop . Whatever it takes . " " By ourselves ? " The ghost sounded startled . " Who other ? " A sigh escaped her . " You have both known him as a man , not a legend . A brilliant one , true , known for testing his tactics in blood - and winning . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it said slowly . Kendra realized she had leaned forward and clasped her hands behind her back , bone straining against bone despite the barrier of flesh . " I will find him , " she said , " if he is willing to be found . " Maro nodded . " Fair enough . The necessary data will be transmitted to you.11 Her image erased itself , leaving the blank screen to gaze at Kendra like a sleepless eye . Lirette , my love , the war is distant flame It taught us how to murder , how to maim . But you were right when you said we 'd not learned That those who kill become the ones worst burned . The needleship was fleet , like all her kind ; Liadhe soon became a scatter of past radiation in the sensors , a hope of starlight to come . Kendra and Edge threaded past outposts with dubious credentials , past battered prospectors " ships that haunted graveyard moons , and through territory no one but rogues had bothered to claim , all the while heading for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bereft of wingmates , they had no safer trajectory toward Faienga . Kendra worried about electromagnetic pulse weapons , which were capable of killing ghosts and which the Liadhen called exorcists . They were forbidden in Liadhe and Veretys , but what of those who lived in the Vein , bound by no honor but their own wants - who saw ghosts as lifeless patterns in a computer rather than comrades ? Finally , two days from the Vein , she asked Edge . " Do n't worry , " it said calmly . " EMP weapons are forbidden in the Vein . Having one in your armament is grounds for detainment or worse . Astrogation , communications , shipyard repairs and medical care - all these are only possible because of computers strung like beads of water on a net between the stars . Exorcists are an obvious terrorist 's weapon . Besides , the cost of EMP that is reliable against generation after generation , genus after genus of electronics , is prohibitive in itself . Something for which I am grateful . It is not a lawless place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How do you know this ? " Kendra wondered . " The war against Veretys went further afield than most people realize , " Edge answered , and said no more on the subject . Strangers hailed them several times : Here is hire , should you wish it , as escort , as scout , as wardancer . The terms they offered varied little and were , Kendra came to realize , highly flattering by their standards . Edge declined each one courteously , and Kendra was ashamed that she had never learned the protocols common to the Vein or the ways of people other than her own and the Veretane . " It does n't surprise me , " the ghost told her while she patiently checked the sensor readings after one such encounter , in case of ambush . " A common thing , to withdraw from other people 's ways after a war and seek comfort in your own . " Kendra did not look up , knowing no eyes would meet hers and that Edge , like all ghosts , monitored her subtler reactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the only other people in the sea of stars . Even when they are so different - " " Not as different as you 've been led to believe . " Edge performed the glissade-and-arpeggio that she had learned to interpret as a sigh : a quote from one of Brent 's own lute pieces . " Kendra , you 've never left Liadhe before , and since the war 's end patrols have been a formality . In the ways of battle the Veretane are very like us . Here , there is no duello , and our best hope would be to flee . There are other war paradigms , few of them so graceful . " She shivered , wondering at the non sequitur . " I have never been in battle , either . " " No , but you were trained to the duello , as were the Veretane . Here , in the Vein , the only grace is survival . " " A brutal place . " " A necessary one . " Its tone became matter-of-fact " There must be a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own laws ; and their laws are more strictly enforced because nothing else holds them together . Which means we must be careful . " This time Kendra did look up , seeking the memory of a man 's face awaiting her gaze . But years had passed and that man must no longer be as she remembered him , either as the father who had raised her after his wife 's untimely death or the war hero Liadhe had honored . " The unwanted . Like mercenaries , who perform a distasteful service . What the people of the Vein take us to be as we pass through . " " We are Liadhen . " " What does that have to do with anything ! " she asked sharply . " Exiles . Our exiles have come this way before and made for themselves a reputation . A good one , I should say , as these people might reckon it . " Hastily , she returned to the sensor displays , colors cool and unthreatening under her eyes , metal cool and unyielding under her hands . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer could I beg of you to wait Until the war was over for all time . There never comes an end : our greatest crime . Kendra had not realized , before this , how she depended on her wingmates " presence in the sensors , familiar patterns that said , Here is friendship past the need of words . From the chains of information , speculation , and gossip strung across the Vein 's networks , Edge gathered word of Liadhe - however sparse - and of the Faienga League 's rebellion . They spent the lonely hours sifting through their gleanings . " I wonder what the Veretane ambassadors mean to do , " Kendra said while scanning the news summaries . " Would n't it be unwise to threaten war with Liadhe when they must already deal with dissent in their own territory ? " " Perhaps , " said the ship 's ghost , " what Liadhen help Faienga has received is significant enough that they have n't much choice . As I told Maro . " She laughed incredulously , though doubts upon doubts stirred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the Veretane fleet sent to subdue them . " Other independents ? Exiles ? Maro mentioned nothing of others whom the Veretane considered to be breaking our treaty . Surely one man could n't make such a difference , alone and away from his people ? " " He became a legend for a reason . " It played a phrase from " Lirette , My Love , " melody pitted against melody upon a single lute 's strings . " They forgot his skills as a musician , great as they were , because his skill in war was even greater . " And yet , Kendra thought , was Brent so wrong ? Edge had summarized Faienga 's history for her : a confederation of sectors that became a Veretane protectorate after the War of Shrouds , yearning toward independence ever since . In battle against Liadhe , Veretys had honored the duello and its conventions , but in putting down the Faiengis claim they denied the right to challenge . Even now the league sought support , and in the Vein the call for mercenaries still circulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us yet . " Oh , Father . Kendra had discovered that parents rarely were as you saw them in childhood , but a thread of disbelief still wove through her thoughts of Brent . Disbelief , and hope . " There is the treaty . " The ghost 's voice gave no indication of its opinion , if any . " He knew about it and he chose to take the risk that Veretys would object . " " He had to have a reason , " she insisted . " My father may be the Warmonger " - her voice nearly broke - " but he would n't have done this without reason . Even if that reason were the glory to be had in such a fight . What if the Faiengis are right ? " Kendra shook her head , shoulders drooping . " And surely he would have known that someone would come to stop him . " " Or try . " " Is that why Maro sent us ? Because he knew us once and might have mercy ? " The ghost paused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps it was also a kindness on her part . Have you never wondered what became of Brent ? " " I knew . " " Parts of it , you mean . " She bowed her head . " I would have liked to see him once , just once , before he left . He was the only one I had as kin-by-blood ; he called me " little one " even when I was not so little , and he decided to go away . " " He was your father and he loved you . Perhaps he meant to avoid hurting you more . " " What do you mean ? " " He was your father , " Edge repeated , " and parents do what they must , for their children 's sake . " The ghost turned the conversation to other topics , and Kendra questioned it no further . Her dreams turned more and more often to the patrols she had left behind , the terse communications she had shared with her wingmates , the duello 's light-spindled displays ; an instrument-crafter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger along a silken string and wishing she had inherited her father 's gift for music ; a null-g garden arranged as a three-dimensional labyrinth , the transparent pipes of water and nutrients glowing like a cat's-cradle , where she and a lover had met ; voices speaking Liadhe 's languages in dialects other than her own that were nonetheless familiar . Edge played music for her that it had learned from Brent or discovered on its own , which eased the ache within her : galliards and fantasias , Ras Niessa 's three syrinx concertos , a fractal symphony , preludes and pavanes . When the Mirror 's Edge had nearly emerged from the Vein near Faienga , the ghost said , " Incoming transmission , " at the moment Kendra found massed starships in the sensors . The readings struck a chord of delight from her heart before she remembered that no Liadhen fleet would have ventured so far from home and that the ships were Veretane Tusk  --  class needleships , a postwar design . She did not bother scanning them ; their heavy shielding - and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the times when abandoning the duello would be wise ? " Kendra asked , only half in jest . Suddenly the thought of testing tactic against tactic , reflex against reflex , sent a glissade of ice along her skin . She had never sought to learn the dynamics of war , the rhythms of danger , the tempo of death . She had no desire to discover firsthand the perils that had drawn her father away from Liadhe . " If we 're attacked . " " Let us answer first , then . " The Mirror 's Edge settled into a lazy roll , exposing its flank to Veretane fire : We are not here to fight . Two of the Veretane ships broke formation to echo the gesture . In duel against other patrols in Liadhe , Kendra and Falcon had only worried about their own opponent . But here she and Edge had no wingmates , no guarantee - as in the duello - that the other three-and-twenty ships would remain passive . " Responding to transmission , " said Edge , then fell silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand in greeting to the man , whose raptor insignia indicated that he commanded the Tusk fleet . He raised his own hand in response , then lowered it . " Are you affiliated with Liadhe , lady ? " he asked in a tongue common to both their nations . Mystified by his phrasing , she said , " We are Liadhen , yes . " " Faienga is interdicted . " From what she and Edge had learned through the Vein 's networks , Kendra knew that ways around the interdict existed . " Your government challenged ours because Sharadon Brent involved himself in your affairs . " She wished she knew how well she had chosen her words , but the commander was nodding , and Edge had not interrupted her . " We are here to deal with him . " Whatever it takes , Maro had told them . " Forgive the question , " he said , " but you are not a mercenary ? " Kendra drew in a breath , held it , set it free . " No . You challenged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pass , then , " said the commander , shaking his head slowly , " and if the Warmonger does not leave with you - " A smile like a knife 's edge thinned his lips . " Would you take an escort ? " It could n't have been so easy , Kendra thought . " An escort ? " she repeated . " It is advisable . " " Required , you mean . " " When the two are one , my lady Liadhen , why quibble over distinctions ? 11 " We accept , " Edge 's voice , stripped of inflection , intervened . " I presume the Faiengis will ask questions before firing upon use " The commander 's smile blunted but slightly . " Keep your reflexes well-honed . But you are Liadhen , both of you ; that ought to be enough , where the Warmonger is concerned . " He saluted them Veretane-style , fist to shoulder  --  Kendra imagined that regret flickered in his eyes - and cut the transmission . One of the Tusk ships detached from the fleet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a pang , tracking its motion and thinking of Falcon , of a simpler life on patrol . No names were given : a subtle discourtesy , but one she was not apt to protest . " We 're coming , " she said aloud , and the Mirror 's Edge accelerated to match course with the Tusk . Oh , Father , I 'm coming . THEY SENT a message hurtling before them into Veretys , into the unwilling part of Veretys that was Faienga : Liadhen vessel Mirror 's Edge and an escort . Liadhen vessel Mirror 's Edge and an escort . Request permission to speak with Sharadon Brent , exile . Liadhen vessel Mirror 's Edge and an escort .... " Incoming transmission , " said Edge . One of the monitors blinked , displaying a course further along Faienga 's border . " We are required to follow this exactly . The Faiengis will hold their fire but no guarantee is made of safe passage . " " They will be tracking us all the way . " " Of course . " Kendra 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once we are away from the Veretane fleet ? By the time the Veretane become aware that something has happened , it will be too late for us .. and our escort . " " And what danger can we be ? 11 the ghost asked reasonably . " We come to parley in response to a challenge , and dare not stray beyond that lest Liadhe embroil herself further in a civil conflict . " The escort continued to pace them , sleek and inscrutable . Uneasily , Kendra wondered what weaponry lay concealed beneath its shielding . The Veretane upgraded their military ships regularly , despite the expense ; she dared make only the vaguest assumptions about its capabilities . Kendra 's heart hammered anticipation as they continued into Faienga even as she tried to untangle her thoughts . Do you still remember your music , Father ? Through the years did you ever think of those you left behind ? Sharadon Brent , who threatened to bring war to Liadhe again . Liadhe , which never abandoned her own , no matter the price . Faienga , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied the Faiengis challenge and challenged Liadhe in turn . " Who is right ? " she asked Edge , her eyes tuned to the sensors and the flickering , constantly updated starmaps that told her they approached the Miello salient . " What do you mean ? " " The rebellion . I know so little . " " Would it help , knowing more ? " Kendra considered . " Yes . No . It would make things less simple . But I grow tired of not knowing . " " You may tire less of it when you know more . " Its tone shifted from compassion to caution . " If this is an ambush , Kendra , we have no hope of escape . " " Yes , " she said after a pause . The sensors spoke of a well-deployed fleet , for all that its ships were of every imaginable type : agile wardancers , battered cruisers , carriers with their accompanying drones , scouts and needleships and more . One of them leapt out at her from the display : a Liadhen needleship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that the Doppelganger is here , " said Edge . " Several ships among the Faiengis fleet are targeting us . " The display had come alight with amber warnings . The Veretane escort no longer echoed their movements but angled itself  --  protectively , Kendra would have said , had she not doubted its motives . " Request communications with Sharadon Brent and - Edge , what is the name of Doppelganger 's ghost ? " " Unknown . " Before she had time even to blink - ghosts recognized each other very well where human memory often failed - it continued , " Requesting parley . " The sensors marked five Faiengis ships as being within range of their lances , two more within range of their missiles . Kendra realized she was holding her breath and let it go . The rebels and their mercenaries could scatter Mirror 's Edge into soulless particles before they returned a shot , and she knew it . " Incoming response . " The man on the viewscreen looked achingly familiar , achingly different , as though eleven years had burned away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform but none of the medals were in evidence , and when he spoke , his voice was low and weary . " Kendra ? Little one ? " His eyes , very like Kendra 's own , searched her face . " The stars have mercy . " jerkily , he raised his hand as though he might reach across the vacuum that separated them . " Father , " she said , and then , self-consciously : " Sir . " She told herself that the burning behind her eyes had nothing to do with tears . Inanely , all she could think of to say was , " Do you still play the lute , Father ? " The man bowed his head . " I no longer have a lute , nor am I capable of playing . I would play you , sing you one last song , if I could . It has been so many years , little one . " Blinking , she glanced down at the sensors to compose herself ; wondered briefly as to the escort 's rationale in drawing away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Faiengis were divided between targeting her and the Veretane ship . " Veretane challenged Liadhe , Father . " Her voice trembled . " The treaty - " The Tusk 's power signatures came suddenly ablaze , preparing for a strike . " Incoming - " Edge began to say . " Watch out ! " Kendra cried without knowing what the Tusk intended . She did not recognize the signature , did not know what weapon would be fired " There 's no time . " Suddenly the man 's voice became cold and crisp . " Little one , little one , please forgive - " The transmission terminated . " Brace for acceleration ! " Edge told Kendra a moment before the Mirror 's Edge came about sharply . Blood swam across her vision until the acceleration leveled off . " We 're being jammed , " she managed to say between gasps . " We received a final databurst from Doppelganger . What 's happening ? " The Faiengis had fired on the Tusk , whose signature grew steadily brighter . " I unscrambled the databurst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A wardancer and two corvettes had detached themselves from the fleet to accompany the Mirror 's Edge on her flight , shielding them . For a sickening second , Kendra thought the Faiengis meant to destroy them . Before she could sort out anything else , the sensors caught a sudden vicious flare : a ship 's swansong in frequencies of radiation rather than sound . " Exorcist , " she whispered . Had they moved a second later and in the wrong direction , the pulse would have killed Edge and left her stranded among strangers . Tears conspired to hide the display from her before she even knew who had died . She wiped them away , unnerved by Edge 's silence as much as anything else . A battle was unfolding , the Faiengis mobilizing to greet the Veretane waiting past the Miello salient ; and the Veretane escort , not Doppelganger , failed to appear in the sensors . The Warmonger 's ship itself moved unthinkingly in a line against the backdrop of stars and dust . She fought with the tears without understanding why ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dust Of dying soldiers , blood and dark bloodlust . Lirette , I left you for a war I rue Alas , Lirette , I 've no songs left for you . " Will he be coming , then ? Coming back to Liadhe ? " asked Kendra when the tears had stopped , though a terrible foreboding gripped her heart . " He ca n't . He 's dead . That 's a dead ship , Kendra . " She caught her breath . " No . The Veretane could n't have . " Desperately , Kendra checked the logs for an account of the blood-blurred moments she had missed . She froze , trying to deny what they told her . " No , " she repeated , more softly . " The Tusk destroyed itself for that pulse . And Brent knew . He knew and warned us instead of getting out of the way , and it cost him the Doppelganger 's ghost . " He had chosen to make himself a target for the Tusk rather than giving it time to redirect the pulse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vein , Edge had told her . But not , it appeared , forbidden in Veretys or the space they called their own . Silently , the wardancer and corvettes accompanied them , leading the way-where , she could not guess . Edge chose to follow them , and she had no strength to protest . " He 's dead , " the ghost said again . " Do you remember the battles he won , Kendra ? Impossible battles that became victories under his leadership ? " Dry-eyed , she looked down at her hands . Not a musician 's hands , hers . " I heard about them after they happened , yes . He should not have survived . " " He did n't . Sharadon Brent died in his eighth battle . It was after that he was transferred to Doppelganger , or so they said . " " That 's impossible . " She had seen him , had she not ? , Seen him barely minutes ago , for all that the years had separated them . But it would be a trivial matter for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vocal recordings , in ship-to-ship communications . I no longer have a lute , nor am I capable of playing . " I was there , " said Edge . She squeezed her eyes shut . " Sharadon Brent died - and he lived again , as the Doppelganger 's ghost . Do you understand , Kendra ? It was a desperate measure . He was too well-known , too well-regarded , for Liadhe to lose him . War needs its heroes . And so they brought him back , what they could salvage of him , but he could never go home ... and so he left . Warmonger . Do you understand ? " " An exorcist , " she said numbly . And the ghost had called her little one . Had asked her forgiveness before warning them away . Edge played a strain from a dirge . " Yes . Because the Veretane must have found out , and fools that we were , we gave them the opening they had set up . We were meant to die as well and none would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor in the treaty . " For a long time Kendra sat there , silent , thinking of shipmates she had known only during patrol , people - like Maro ? - she had met only indirectly , people who might pose as human if they avoided face-to-face contact . People who were ghosts and braved battle alone , partnerless . People like her father , ghost or human , it hardly mattered to her . " Do we return home , Kendra ? " said Edge . " Or do we stay ? Because if word reaches Liadhe , she will have no choice but to respond , with Brent our first casualty . Or we can leave Liadhe ignorant and avoid another war . " Warmonger . But perhaps some battles were worth fighting . " We return , " she said . If her father had sacrificed himself for their sake , she could do no less than bring word of his death back to Liadhe . " I miss him , too , " said the ghost , responding to her tone , and then they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toward their home . for Paul Urayama
