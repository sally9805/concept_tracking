As the story goes , executives of R.B. Dereli Yachts , a Turkish megayacht manufacturer , had built commuter boats similar to the DayTripper to run from the company 's head office to its shipyard in Tuzla , across the Marmara Sea . While visiting the yard a few years ago , employees of Alliance Marine , a yacht sales and charter firm in Pompano Beach , Fla. , were allowed to borrow one of the boats , and they fell in love with it . Alliance soon joined forces with Dereli to put a modified version of this craft into production and distribute it in the U.S. The result : the DayTripper 40 . What 's special about this semicustom cruiser ? It has top-notch woodwork and boasts all-composite construction  --  building materials include epoxy resins , E-Glass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a turnkey boat . " The only things not included are the upgraded engines , the granite countertops and the TV , " said Alliance President Robert Bell during our sea trial off Miami , Fla . The DayTripper comes with a bowthruster , generator , icemaker , eight-way electric helm chair , teak decks and trim , cherry or mahogany interior , and full electronics . The standard equipment list is very competitive with those of other upscale Downeast-style craft in the size range , such as the San Juan 38 and Hinckley Talaria 40 . Despite its name , I refuse to call the DayTripper a day boat . It has only a forward berth , but the vessel can sleep five when you count the convertible dinette to starboard , opposite the galley and head , and the pilothouse settee . The DayTripper differs from many similar-sized lobster yachts in terms of its engine placement . These boats often have engines mounted amidships . But Dereli found that people seated on the rear bench in this type of boat quickly moved forward for protection from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the DayTripper and slid the bench forward . Now its occupants remain comfortable while the boat is under way . The trade-off is you lose a significant amount of cockpit space to the raised afterdeck/engine hatch cover . Adding sunpads here could be a nice compromise . During our run on Biscayne Bay , the DayTripper 's twin 440-hp Yanmars , coupled to Hamilton water jets , granted the boat the gusto of an express cruiser . Top speed was 33.7 knots , with a cruise of 23 knots at 2750 rpm . Not bad , I thought , but Bell contends the boat is capable of 37 knots with a clean bottom . Lifting strakes and nacelles in the aft sections of the hull helped the 40 plane quickly , and the ride was solid in the two-foot chop we met . The extra engine weight aft did n't seem to affect our flat running angle or upset hookup in the turns . And , of course , prop-less water-jet power makes for minimal draft . The DayTripper 40 has the sex appeal , sturdy ride and high-end finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all of the trimmings . Specifications : LOA 40 ' 4 " Beam 12 ' 0 " Draft 2 ' 0 " Disp. 17,500 lbs .
