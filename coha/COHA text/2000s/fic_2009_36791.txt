" Hmm ! I wonder if that 's life-size , " Miss Daisy Drake murmured . She leaned down to inspect the ancient lamp on display in the corridor outside the Society of Antiquaries lecture hall . Talking to herself was a bad habit , she knew , but since none of her friends shared her interest in antiquities , she often found herself without companions on this sort of outing . <p> " Of course , it would be on the most inaccessible shelf in the display case . " Solely to vex her , she suspected . Daisy scrunched down to get a better look at it . <p> The clay lamp was only about four inches long , but in other respects , so far as Daisy knew , was perfectly lifelike . The terra-cotta scrotum served admirably for an oil cruse , but even though she knew the ancients decorated their homes with such unseemly things , she still wondered about how the lamp worked . She opened her small valise and drew out paper , quill and inkpot in order to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " Right where one would expect , " a masculine voice sounded near her . <p> Daisy 's spine snapped suddenly upright . The crown of her head clipped the man 's chin with a thwack and she bit her tongue . <p> " Jupiter ! " One of her hands flew to her throbbing mouth , the other to the top of her head , where her cunning little hat was smashed beyond recognition . Her sheaf of papers fluttered to the polished oak floor like maple leaves . The small inkwell flew into the air and landed squarely on the white lawn of the man 's shirtfront . <p> " Oh , I 'm so dreadfully sorry . " Daisy dabbed at the stain with her hankie and succeeded only in spreading it down his waistcoat . A black blob dribbled onto his fawn-colored breeches . She decided not to chase that stain with her handkerchief . <p> At least , thank heaven , plastering the man with ink covered her unmaidenly interest in that lewd little lamp . It was clearly a mistake to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Society of Antiquaries was the possible discovery of an ancient Roman treasure . The lure of an adventure drew her like a lemming to the sea . <p> " How clumsy of me ! " She made the additional mistake of looking up at the man . Her mouth gaped like a cod 's . <p> Lucian , she almost said aloud . When she saw no trace of recognition in his dark eyes , she drew her lips closed by sheer strength of will . <p> He 'd grown into himself since she 'd seen him last . His fine , straight nose was no longer out of proportion to the rest of his face . As he rubbed his square jaw , Daisy saw that the little scar on his chin was still visible , a neat triangle of pale , smooth skin . She 'd recognize that anywhere . <p> After all , she 'd given it to him . <p> His dark hair was hidden beneath a dandy 's wig . Oh , she hoped to heaven he had n't taken to shaving his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dogged opponent of the fashion . Said it was nothing but French foppery . Since Uncle Gabriel 's opinions were only slightly less authoritative than a papal bull , his aversion to wigs had rubbed off . Besides , hiding a head of hair like Lucian 's was a sacrilege . Or ought to be . <p> An ebony wisp escaped near his left ear . <p> Good . Daisy breathed a sigh of relief . His dark mane was one of Lucian 's finest points , after all . Not that there were n't plenty of others . <p> His lips twitched in a half smile . <p> " An interesting piece , is n't it ? " He was still the same old Lucian . Still direct , even at the expense of propriety . He was n't going to play the gentleman and pretend he had n't caught her ogling that Roman phallus . <p> " Indeed . " She met his gaze , determined to make him understand that her interest was purely intellectual . " Obviously a cultic object of some sort . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find a young lady who is ... curious . " <p> Daisy lifted her chin in what she hoped was a confident manner . " Of course I 'm curious . Such an item makes one wonder what the people who used it were like . " <p> " I suspect the ancients were more like us than we want to admit . People have been born into this world with the same wants and needs since Eden . Though I 'll grant you our taste in home decoration has changed , " he said with a laugh . <p> " Actually , I read a treatise only last week on the new fashion of tassels . The writer felt they were merely phallic symbols in subtle form . " <p> " Hmph . I shall never look at a tassel the same way again . " <p> His eyes narrowed in speculation . Daisy hoped he might show some sign of remembering her , but it had been more than a decade since they 'd met . She 'd been a flat-chested ten-year-old , and he 'd been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blinding smile . <p> Now he turned that charming smile on her without a hint of recognition in his intense gaze . " You must possess an unusual library . " <p> The library Daisy frequented most often belonged to Isabella Haversham , her great-aunt . Isabella had once been a famous courtesan . But even now that she was a married lady-the wife of an earl , no less-she still entertained philosophers and artists and " freethinkers " with regularity . Lady Wexford might be painted with scandal 's brush , but an evening in her company was far more diverting than squirming through the tortured clavichord recitals that took place in other parlors around the city . <p> Daisy wangled an invitation to Isabella 's soirees as often as she could . For that reason , as well as her great-aunt 's library , Daisy suspected her education was considerably broader than that of most young women her age . <p> " Innocence and ignorance need not forever clasp hands , " Isabella was fond of saying . <p> Daisy looked pointedly back at the lamp . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She might as well put a bold face on it . <p> " I was wondering if there is any kind of mark on that lamp , " Daisy said . " One that might indicate who the maker was . " <p> " He left no mark , " Lucian said . <p> " He ? So you believe a man fashioned it ? " <p> " Men were the artisans in antiquity , " he said with confidence . <p> " Hmm . That surprises me , " she said with wide eyes . " I ca n't imagine a man wanting to set one of those alight . " <p> Lucian coughed out a laugh . " But you can see where a woman might have reason . " <p> " Certainly . Male domination of nearly every field of endeavor springs to mind . " As well as possession of the memory of a gnat , she added silently . " But the lamp poses a host of questions . " <p> " Ah , yes , and you raised an intriguing one . " One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overheard her . " I 'd be happy to help you discover the answer . " <p> Was he suggesting something improper ? If he was , it would serve him right if she gave him another scar . <p> " You owe me no further assistance . Not after I ruined your shirt . And your waistcoat . And your ... " She should n't have allowed her gaze to travel the ink 's path down the front of his breeches . For a moment , she imagined an appendage shaped like the lamp affixed to his groin , and felt her cheeks heat . To cover her embarrassment , she sank to the floor to retrieve her scattered notes . <p> " Think nothing of it . " His voice was no longer the adolescent squeak she remembered . " I should be more careful where I put my jaw . I do hope you have not suffered an injury to your head . " <p> The way his deep baritone rumbled through her , the fact that she even had a head temporarily escaped her notice . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valise he 'd been carrying and knelt beside her . He helped her reassemble her pages . Then he offered his hand to help her up , and she took it . <p> Had someone loosed a jar of june bugs in her belly ? <p> " Thank you , my lord , " she murmured , for lord he was . <p> Lucian Ignacio de Castenello Beaumont . Son and heir of Ellery Beaumont , Earl of Montford . Daisy assumed Lucian was now styling himself Viscount Rutland , one of his father 's lesser titles , since the earl was still very much alive . <p> But Daisy remembered Lucian as Iggy . <p> His ears had turned an alarming shade of red when she called him that . " Iggy " was not dignified , he 'd complained . As if a skinny , dirty-kneed twelve-year-old were capable of anything remotely like dignity . <p> But Lucian was no longer twelve . He was a man . And the last time Daisy heard his name bandied about in polite society , the sober matron doing the talking lowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were unmistakably used . <p> Neither of which did anything to slow her racing heart , Daisy admitted with a sigh . <p> She accepted the stack of papers from him . " There 's no salvaging your ensemble , I fear . Please permit me to have a new suit of clothing made for you . " <p> She could afford to be generous . After all , she 'd discovered the family fortune beneath the stones of Dragon Caern Castle just when other members of the nobility were losing theirs in the South Sea stock swindle . <p> " I would n't hear of it , " he assured her smoothly , though she knew Lucian 's father had invested heavily in the failed company . Perhaps his mother 's family was still solvent . She 'd been a noblewoman in her homeland . Nearly all the vestiges of Lucian 's Italian accent were now gone . Daisy thought that a terrible shame . <p> " I 've been meaning to retire this suit in any case , " he informed her . " The style is tres passT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity , since the cut of that green frock coat does wonderful things for his shoulders , and as for those bree-Daisy caught herself before her thoughts completely ran away with her , but lost her fight with the urge to flick her gaze to where his breeches molded to his thighs . <p> He caught the direction of her gaze and an amused grin tilted his lips . " My ! You are a keen observer , are n't you ? " <p> " Forgive me . Ruining your suit has upset me , " she said , her cheeks flaming . " I 'm acting like some pudding-headed debutante . " Instead she was firmly on-the-shelf spinster of one and twenty . <p> " If you were a debutante , I 'd have remembered you , " he said . <p> Daisy doubted it . Especially since he showed no signs of recognizing her yet . Surely she bore some resemblance to the young girl who 'd followed him about like a puppy so many years ago . His family had spent only a week in residence at Dragon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most splendid , most memorable week of her young life . <p> " However , if you want my advice , " he continued , " your chances of remaining unmarried will decrease if you try not to douse every man you meet with ink . " <p> " Perhaps remaining unmarried is my choice . " She frowned until she noticed the way he flashed his teeth at her , clearly teasing . Lucian was the sort of man a woman might forgive anything so long as he smiled at her . <p> Daisy bit her lip to keep from babbling further . She sidled away from the case where the phallic lamp was on display . <p> Lucian looked around the nearly deserted exhibit hall . " It seems there is no way for us to be properly introduced , but perhaps you will allow me the honor of giving you my name . " <p> Final proof that he truly did n't recognize her . Her belly spiraled downward in disappointment . <p> How was it possible that she could carry his image in her head for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even existed ? Bristling with indignation , she took another step backward to put more distance between them . <p> Before she could remind him that he should already know her name ( and quite well , thank you very much ! ) , the door behind her swung open and whacked her soundly on the bottom . Then the door slammed shut as whoever opened it realized he 'd hit something . Daisy stumbled forward and Lucian caught her in his arms . <p> She was pressed tight against him , suddenly engulfed in his masculine scent , a clean whiff of sandalwood and soap . Beneath her splayed fingers , the musculature in his chest was rock hard . Her breath caught in her throat . <p> " Are you injured , miss ? " Lucian asked . <p> " Only my pride . " Daisy pushed against him as a signal he should release her . She was n't about to admit that her derriere throbbed . <p> " No , I fear we have another casualty , " he said , not loosening his hold on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dTcolletage , where some of the ink from his shirt and waistcoat had been transferred . Part of the stain marred her pale blue stomacher and part darkened the mound of her breast that rose above it . <p> " Pity . An alabaster bosom should never wear black . " He drew a fingertip along the froth of lace at the neckline she 'd always thought of as modest , but never would again . " Alas , I forgot my handkerchief this morning or I should return the favor and try to wipe it off . " <p> The thought of his hand on her skin with only a thin layer of cloth between them made her belly quiver . <p> The door creaked behind her and eased open a tentative few inches . A monocled gentleman peeked in and waved Lucian over with urgency . <p> " There you are , Rutland . We 've been waiting for you . " <p> Daisy started and jumped away from Lucian . She recognized the gentleman as Sir Alistair Fitzhugh , head of the Society of Antiquaries . She 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alistair blackball her membership on account of her gender . The man cast a quick dismissive gaze over her and turned back to Lord Rutland . <p> A baron 's niece counted for very little when measured against a viscount , she supposed . <p> Fitzhugh 's monocle popped out and dangled from its silver chain as he eyed the large , oddly shaped ink stain on Lucian 's clothing . " Good God , man , what 's happened to you ? " <p> " It was- " Daisy began . <p> " My fault entirely , " Lucian finished for her . " I will be in directly , Fitzhugh . " <p> Lucian turned back to Daisy . " Perhaps once I 've delivered my presentation- " <p> " Hold a moment , " she interrupted , stunned . She 'd expected an Oxford-don type would lead the discussion . " You 're the speaker ? " <p> He nodded with a wry grin . " When I 'm allowed to be . " <p> She covered her mouth with her fingertips . When had Lucian become an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost Roman treasure . <p> " As I was saying , I hope we may continue our discussion at a later time . I 'd enjoy learning what else such a charming young lady finds ... curious in these dry halls . " He retrieved his valise , made an elegant leg and shot her a wicked grin . " And for your information , the answer is no . " <p> " No ? " Her brows nearly met in a puzzled frown . <p> " It 's not life-size . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
