Tired of stale movies and staticky Muzak on those long , dull airplane rides ? Song Airways , a new cut-rate carrier operated by Delta Air Lines , plans to offer flyers a much needed upgrade of in-flight entertainment . <P> Launching April 15 with a flight from New York City to West Palm Beach , Fla. , Song plans by October to equip each of its Boeing 757s with an impressive array of high-tech amenities , starting with an M jukebox that lets passengers create customized playlists culled from hundreds of music albums . Using touch-screen monitors mounted on the back of each seat , travelers will also be able to surf 24 channels of live satellite TV , challenge their seatmates to multiplayer video games from Nintendo and map the airplane 's exact location  --  zooming in to street-level detail on the terrain below . <P> Pretty snazzy for a discount airline , especially since all this is included in the ticket price . If you want a Snickers bar with your free soft drink , however , it will cost you $2 . Penny-wise travelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anita Hamilton
