<p> " Tastes like chicken " is a phrase that plagues American cuisine . I 've heard it used in describing seafood , crocodile , pork and veal . If memory serves , it also lassos in tofu and ricotta  --  anything not immediately identifiable . <p> Whoever utters the phrase is condemning chicken and chicken consumers to the nether regions of gastronomy . It generally means bland , neutral and characterless  --  in other words , a whitewash . <p> Chef Paul Canales takes exception . Canales heads the kitchen of Oliveto , the well-regarded Italian restaurant in Oakland 's Rockridge neighborhood . <p> Last fall , he produced a " Fare Is Fowl " dinner , a feast intended to let all things fowl take flight . That Canales would headline poultry in the way Oliveto has annually celebrated themed dinners around exalted truffles and beloved tomatoes , for examples , made a clear statement about the importance of the bird . <p> For Canales , poultry is not dull and certainly not characterless . To him , the phrase " tastes like chicken " means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaty flavors of carefully raised poultry , with the differentiated textures of white and dark meat . <p> A hands-on executive chef , Canales uses the special dinners to teach his staff new techniques , ideas , recipes and tastes . From his in-depth lesson in bird cuisine , home cooks also can take away some important pointers for the country 's favorite meat that are perfect for preparing mid-winter meals . <p> Canales runs his kitchen as a professor might run a seminar , or a coach a workout . In the week before the special dinners , an avalanche of fowl varieties streamed through the kitchen . Most of them arrived completely intact , with heads and feet attached . Cooks smoked pheasant , cured chicken , stuffed quail , ground turkey , skewered pigeons , marinated hens , dried ducks , crushed bones and extracted rich stock . <p> But even before all that came the task of choosing the birds themselves . If chicken is fed well and slaughtered and cooled in the right manner , it will taste better , he says . Buying a high-quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicious dish . <p> Hoffman Game Birds of Manteca , for example , dries its birds in cool air in the style of the poultry farmers of Brest , France , rather than according to the American mass-produced technique of dropping them in an ice-water bath . <p> Commercially raised chicken " tastes like nothing . They 're bland . Their texture is wrong ; it 's mushy , " Canales says . <p> The U.S. Department of Agriculture advises consumers to cook poultry until it reaches an internal temperature of 180 degrees , which can turn it dry and flavorless . The high internal temperature is designed to eliminate all traces of bacteria that could potentially cause salmonella and other illnesses . <p> However , chefs and other food professionals say potential for salmonella stems from the way in which commercial chickens are raised  --  in crowded conditions , given steroids and feed that contains antibiotics and possibly animal by-products . Canales ' recipes , which use artisan poultry , call for an internal temperature around 145 degrees . After resting , the internal temperature rises about 5 degrees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting with a good bird . That 's the price of admission . " <p> The second lesson for cooks , Canales says , is to " start with the whole damn bird . " The reason ? " The minute a bird is cut , it starts to purge . " Juices and enzymes begin to leak out  --  and with them , flavor , moisture and likely nutrition . <p> Canales points to the toweling at the bottom of meat trays that absorbs the liquids from cut meats , poultry and seafood . In most trays of packaged poultry , the towel is completely saturated with liquid . <p> His advice : Buy the whole bird and have it cut by the butcher . Better still , cut it yourself just before cooking ( see photos above and next page ) . <p> When cutting , or just when preparing the bird for cooking , be sure to follow safe handling instructions ( see accompanying safety recommendations ) . <p> Artisan birds can also differ in other ways . Heirlooms  --  traditional breeds of chickens and turkeys that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conditions that allow them to run and move . That means they have well-developed thigh and leg muscles ; the breast muscles are typically smaller than those of mass-produced chickens . <p> That reverses the commercial producers ' goal of raising closely confined birds with a broader and bigger breast and small legs . <p> Just as different cuts of beef , lamb and pork cook differently , so do different parts of a chicken . For example , in the accompanying recipe for Barbera-Braised Young Hen , an Italian version of a coq au vin , Canales advises lifting the white meat out after 20 to 25 minutes of stewing . The dark meat continues for another 20 minutes , and the two cuts are combined just before serving . <p> In Cabbage Rolls with Turkey Stuffing &; Pevra Sauce , the three parts of turkey are cut in three different ways . The leg and thigh meats , more moist , are put through a medium grind . The breast meat , drier and less marbled , is cut by hand into cubes . Finally , the delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mousse . <p> The three are folded together and highlighted with chestnuts before the mixture is rolled into cabbage leaves . A gentle heat , steam , cooks the rolls for mere minutes before they are served . <p> Canales finds dark meat to be more versatile than white meat , and uses the dark meat in a dozen braised or stewed dishes , such as meatballs . Because he uses game birds that are marbled and hearty-flavored , Canales ' chicken meatballs are delicate yet full of character . Simple fresh breadcrumbs and egg hold the meat together , while the flavor is spiked with Parmesan . <p> As for roasting the whole bird , Canales puts chickens , pigeons and pheasants on a spit and roasts them over wood , seasoning just with salt and pepper . By rotisserie-cooking the birds , the juice and fat of the bird evenly baste the entire bird under the skin throughout the cooking process . He says it 's not necessary to brine a bird if it is raised by an artisanal grower since the flavor is already there . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , even without a spit . Simply put the bird on a roasting rack , and rotate it four times in the cooking and pre-carving process . Begin with the breast side down , which allows the thickest part , the thighs , to be at the highest place and pointed toward the hottest part of the oven , the back wall . After 20 minutes , turn the bird on one wing side , then the other side and lastly breast side up ( see accompanying recipe ) . Finally , if you wish , Canales says , rest the chicken with the breast side down before carving to allow juices to flow to the drier white meat . <p> When we tried the method in The Chronicle 's test kitchen , the Hoffman hen was moist , evenly cooked and tender . <p> During the Fare to Fowl dinners , Canales and his staff turned out platters of whole pigeon stuffed with pancetta and red cabbage , pastas with eight kinds of poultry ragus and cracklings , and cabbage rolls and many poultry sausages , among other dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delicacy , yet full of character , and adaptable to an impressive range of culinary treatments . <p> As Canales and his staff tasted some of the bird dishes , he could say , with pleasure , " Tastes like chicken . " <p> 1 . Remove both legs from the bird , cutting parallel to the thigh bone and down to the socket . If you wish , slip the knife toward the backbone to catch the " oyster " cheek meat next to the tail . <p> 2 . Separate the thigh and drumstick . <p> 3 . Slip the knife into the shoulder around the wing , cut through the ribs close to the backbone . Repeat on the other side . <p> 4 . Lift off the entire breast . <p> 5 . Split the breast in half lengthwise . <p> 6 . Cut each breast half in two . You will now have four breast pieces - two with wings attached . <p> Safety recommendations <p> The California Department of Food and Agriculture and the United States Department of Agriculture track bird flu ( avian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions and imports of birds . <p> The two agencies survey commercial flocks and backyard flocks , as well as live bird markets and migratory birds . This includes the small , artisanal producers of organic , heritage and heirloom varieties of chickens and other fowl . <p> According to the USDA , the avian flu virus is not transmissible through eating cooked poultry . <p> The agency recommends following the steps below to ensure all poultry is properly handled and cooked : <p> Wash hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds before and after handling food ; <p> Prevent cross-contamination by keeping raw meat , poultry , fish and their juices away from other foods ; <p> After cutting raw meats , wash cutting board , knife and countertops with hot , soapy water ; <p> Sanitize cutting boards by using a solution of 1 teaspoon chlorine bleach in 1 quart of water ; <p> Use a food thermometer to ensure food has reached the proper temperature . <p> For more information , visit the USDA 's Web site , www.usada.gov/birdflu.  --  Olivia Wu <p> Bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasture-raised , organic birds and sell them in select retailers or at farmers ' markets .

Split breast in half along the breast bone , and cut each half in two . Remove the thigh-legs from the backbone . Split the backbone . Separate the thighs from the legs . You have 4 pieces of white meat and 4 pieces of dark meat . <p> Place the cut chicken in a non-reactive , deep but small pan , to ensure that the bird is completely immersed in the wine . Pour the wine over the pieces and turn them , making sure all pieces are coated and that the liquid just covers the chicken . Cover with plastic , pushing the plastic down against the chicken and wine to eliminate air pockets . Refrigerate for 3 to 4 days . <p> On the day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquid . The chicken will be tinged a purplish color and the wine tinged brown . Dry the chicken thoroughly .

It 's imperative to cook the sugo slowly by gradually sweating the proteins , fat and other matter off the bones . In this manner , you wo n't have to add extra fat . In all , the process should take about 2 1/2-3 hours . The result is a concentrate that may be used as a simple sauce for pasta , vegetable and meat dishes or as the base for a more complex sauce . <p> INGREDIENTS : <p> 4 to 5 pounds of poultry bones ( turkey , hen , pigeon ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Kosher salt and pepper <p> 1 onion , diced finely <p> 1/2 cup diced carrots <p> 1/2 cup diced celery <p> 2 sprigs fresh thyme <p> 1 bay leaf <p> 1 clove <p> 1 cup white or red wine <p> About 1 quart chicken stock <p> INSTRUCTIONS : <p> Use a cleaver to crack and break bones of fowl  --  <p> you may put them in a heavy duty stand mixer with the paddle to further break them . Place in a large 6-quart pan or a big casserole with 4-inch sides . The low sides allow for evaporation . <p> Salt the bones and place in the pot over low heat . This will " sweat " the bones , meaning they will release liquid and fat . <p> When a thin film of liquid coats the bottom of the pan , turn heat to medium-high . Mash the bones with a wooden spoon or a potato masher to extract juices . <p> Allow to cook on medium- high for 3 to 5 minutes , stirring only to prevent burning  --  you want a layer of solids to caramelize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fond . " <p> When all the liquid has cooked off , add onion , carrot , celery , thyme , bay leaf and clove , and lower the heat . Allow the vegetables to cook to tender , stirring occasionally . Add the wine and 1-1 1/2 cups of the stock , just to cover the bones . Begin scraping the bottom of the pot , releasing the solids . <p> As the sugo cooks down and begins to attach to the bottom of the pan , add another cup of stock and again scrape the fond . Repeat . <p> Add remaining stock , bring the contents to a simmer and cook for about 1 hour . Pour the sugo and bones into a strainer and press to extract all remaining juices and solids . Adjust seasoning . <p> Yields about 1 3/4 cups <p> Note : The sugo may be jarred and refrigerated or frozen in ice cube trays . <p> Because of the nature of this recipe , a nutritional analysis is not possible . <p> Chicken Meatballs with Pasta <p> The " polpettini " make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from chicken . Their stronger , earthier flavor and smoother , lighter texture raise them to the level of a delicate meatball . They can be served with a simple broth as the " sauce . " At Oliveto , the meatballs are served with a house-made chestnut penne . If possible , purchase a fresh pasta that has a sweet edge , for example a butternut squash penne . Plain penne would also work . <p> INGREDIENTS : <p> 4 skinless , boneless chicken legs ( thigh and drumstick ) <p> 1 cup fresh bread crumbs <p> 1 cup milk <p> About 2 tablespoons olive oil <p> 1/2 cup finely minced onion <p> 1 clove garlic , minced <p> 2 fresh sage leaves , minced <p> 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves <p> 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon <p> 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg <p> 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice <p> 1 egg <p> 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese <p> Kosher salt and pepper to taste <p> 2 cups rich chicken/turkey broth , at room temperature , or 4 cups purchased chicken broth cooked down to 2 cups , at room temperature <p> 2 tablespoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penne pasta , preferably fresh <p> Additional grated Parmesan ( for serving ) <p> INSTRUCTIONS : <p> Finely grind the chicken in a meat grinder . Alternatively , cut it into small pieces and pulse to a fine grind in the food processor . Set aside . <p> In a separate bowl , combine the breadcrumbs with milk to moisten them . Set aside . <p> In a small fry pan , heat olive oil and cook onion , garlic and sage over medium low until the onions are tender , about 6 minutes . Stir in the cloves , cinnamon , nutmeg and allspice and pour the mixture into the breadcrumbs . Set aside to cool . Add egg and stir vigorously . Add the ground chicken , cheese , and salt and pepper . Mix the ingredients thoroughly or until the mixture feels slightly tacky , a sign that it is binding together . To taste , cook a small patty in a skillet . If it is not moist enough , add milk to the mixture . Adjust salt and other seasonings as needed . It should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 450 . <p> Using a melon baller or small ice cream scoop , form the mixture into 1 to 1 1/2-inch balls . Roll them by hand to smooth the surface . Place on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper . Place in the oven and bake for about 5 minutes . When they are firm to the touch , remove from oven . <p> Bring the broth to a boil and reduce by about 1/2 cup . Drop the balls into the broth and heat thoroughly . Add the butter and swirl until it is melted . <p> Meanwhile , cook the pasta according to package instructions and drain . <p> Serve the meatballs over the pasta along with grated Parmesan . <p> Note : The meatballs can be refrigerated in the broth for two days or frozen for future use . <p> Serves 6 ( makes about 60 meatballs ) <p> PER SERVING : 590 calories , 43 g protein , 62 g carbohydrate , 19 g fat ( 7 g saturated ) , 125 mg cholesterol , 985 mg sodium , 2 g fiber . <p> Cabbage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses the dark and light meat of half a 10-12 pound turkey . <p> He treats each type of meat  --  leg , breast and tenderloin  --  differently .
