RIDGE WEATHER <p> It was the hay bales that did it . The men and women who knew Osby least , who nodded at him from passing trucks or said " Hey " while scanning cans of soup in the Mic-or-Mac , they might not have seen the change come over him . But the few who knew him a little better would have noticed Osby 's usual quietness grown heavier , that he stuffed his hands in his sweatshirt pocket a little more often . They would have chalked it up to him missing his father , figured it for nothing more than a rebalancing of the weight of a life that suddenly contained one instead of two people . They would have been wrong . <p> The truth was , it did n't even make sense to Osby . How could rolls of old dead grass scare him so ? What was the sense behind it being that - the sight of those wasted bales on that wasted government land-that finally dug from him his tears ? But it was the bales . And afterwards , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In those weeks , as the memory of old Cortland Caudill receded to the horizons of peoples ' minds , even those passing Osby in the supermarket aisles would have felt the sadness still hanging off him . Though it probably would have seemed pretty normal to them . In a place like Eads County , people sometimes get like Osby did . They 're scattered all over the valley , hidden from each other by the old ridges and thick woods , by log walls of age-sunk cabins , new ranch-house brick , by paint-peeling clapboard and trailer home siding so thin the propane bill is twice what it should be , never mind the electricity for the glowing space heaters that struggle in each room . <p> The First Congregational Church of Harts Run had always looked pretty to Osby . Some early mornings , when he was out on Route 33 before the sun had scaled the ridge , he would round the bend and see the church way up ahead , perched at the top of the hill as if God had put the limestone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened just a few times in all his thirty-eight years-the sun would rise exactly as Osby came barreling around the corner , and the church would light up right before his eyes . Times like that , he would take a sip of coffee , turn the radio down so it blended with the rumble of the Sierra 's engine , and imagine it was his headlights , and not the sun , that pulled the church out of the half-dark . He liked to pretend that if he had n't come along just then , the church would have stayed dim all day . That , as much as anything else , was why he chose to hold the funeral there . <p> The day of the service , it was warm for January in the hills . When Osby arrived at the church , about an hour before everyone else , he swung open the truck door and held out a hand , palm up in the air , gazing at the sky , testing the sun like most people would rain . Thirty-eight , thirty-nine , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pastures would stay clear of snow ; he 'd save on hay . He wondered if the ground up at the family cemetery would have thawed a little if he 'd waited a day on the funeral . Not much , he decided . It was always colder on Bowmans Ridge . Even on those fall days , years ago , when he was a kid and they used to go up there for picnics . Earlier that morning , breaking up the frozen topsoil with a pickax , the memory had come to him : his father , shivering as he walked beneath the old apple tree , over dry leaves between the graves , searching for a good patch of sunlight in which to spread the blanket . <p> Now , Osby switched on the radio and sat in the truck cab , waiting for the DJ to hand over the weather report . Every autumn , as far back as he could remember-five years old ? four ? - he would climb the apple tree , shimmy out on the twisted limbs , and shake down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would watch his father wander below , stooping to pick up the few good ones , carrying them back to Osby 's mother . She would sit in the sun , soft and edgeless in a thick , lilac sweater , her knees drawn to her chest , gazing over the valley . His father would crouch next to her , peeling an apple with his pocketknife . He would hand her slices . She would reach up and take them from his fingers . <p> The year before she died , his mother was too weak from the chemotherapy to handle the rough ride up to Bowmans Ridge . So it was just Osby and his father standing by the truck , the breeze between them making noise in the leaves . After a while , his father strode to the tree , yanked an apple off , came back . Osby listened to him chew and watched the furious movement of his jaw . Halfway through the apple , Cortland snapped open his pocketknife and cut off a slice . Carefully , Osby took it from the offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was twelve . <p> In the truck cab , the DJ blared on . Glad of the noise , Osby shook his head , smiled a little . What a strange man his father had been . <p> Forty-one degrees and sunny , according to the radio . <p> Osby grinned . He 'd figured out long ago it was about three degrees cooler up in the hills . He glanced around the empty parking lot , as if looking for someone who might congratulate him . There were n't even any tires grinding up the gravel yet . <p> The church never did get more than half full , but the minister gave as good a sermon as could have been expected . Some of it was pure bull-how Cortland had stayed by his wife to the end ; how to his last days he had never questioned God 's will . Some of it was half-right-how Osby 's father had worked all his life to make the farm prosperous ; he had never meddled in business that was n't his ; he had single-handedly raised his son into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cortland Caudill had loved his cows . <p> Osby figured he could n't have done much better . His father had not been a communicative man . He was n't a bad man , not even a bad father . He was n't mean to anyone ; he just was n't especially nice to anyone , either . Outside , melted snow dripped off the church eves . It sounded like spring . Osby felt he ought to miss his father , but he did n't , not really . Neither , he guessed , did the others in the church . His father had n't really cared to make many friends . <p> Osby looked around at the thirty-odd people , most of them his father 's age . They looked peaceful . The minister did n't mention the one thing that would have made everybody uneasy , did n't even acknowledge it with any special condolences to Osby . So there was n't much to be upset about in the room . Swaths of sunlight streamed through the windows , warm like only strong sun through glass on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was a comfortable sixty-nine , seventy degrees . <p> At the end , the minister asked if anyone wanted to say something , and the whole roomful of people looked at Osby . He wished they 'd go back to sitting happily in the sunlight . The minister shut the Bible very quietly and smiled right at him . Osby smiled back , but felt just afterwards that it was the wrong thing to do . He glanced at Carl and , sitting at Carl 's side , Lynne and their two boys further down the pew . Carl scratched his newly trimmed beard , jowls shaking , and flicked a glance back at Osby . It was a look Osby knew : the worry that came over his friend when Carl realized Osby was going to say something . <p> Osby was n't considered the smartest man in Eads County . But then no one , not even Carl , knew him well enough to realize that he was n't all that far from it either . His problem was that people could hear only what he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always came out saying something other than what he had intended ; and , even when he did get them right , they were usually the last thought of a sequence . Without anyone knowing the process he 'd taken to get there , what he finally got to rarely made much sense . Over the years , it had worn him down , so now he seldom said very much of anything to anybody . <p> Slowly , Osby stood up , taking as long about it as he could , letting the pew 's groans and creaks fill the silence . He stood there for a moment , looking at his cracked , red hands pressed against the edge of the pew in front of him . He tried to think of what his father would have liked him to say , tried to think of what Cortland Caudill would have said himself , and then , failing at that , Osby just tried to remember something good about his dad . The thing that came to him was n't one memory , but a series of them : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clanking around under the dump truck , or while picking through clothes at the church donations store in Ripplemead , or ruining their hunting by calling out potential calf-christenings- " Woodrow ? " " Lloyd ? " " Skeeter ? " - from his tree stand to Osby 's . Years and years of it , from as far back as Osby could remember . He knew there were other things that made his father happy , but he could n't recall them . <p> " Well , " he finally said , " Dad thought an awful lot of his beef . Once he give a calf its name , that 's what he called it . Heifers , cows , bulls , named them all like they was dairy cows . Never knowed anyone else to do that . I do n't believe he once named a calf the same , neither . Not in all his years . " It was n't until after he said it that Osby realized just how incredible that was . " We got some cows been calfin ' eight , nine years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father would have liked to leave it at that , but it seemed wrong , so Osby said , " I guess we all will . " <p> At the muddy jeep trail up to Bowmans Ridge , they slid the casket out of the hearse and lifted it into Osby 's pickup . Anyone with a car left it at the side of 247 and piled into the trucks . The wind was blowing up at the Caudill cemetery , and it was colder , like Osby had known it would be . They did n't take long getting Cortland in the ground . Everyone was glad to get back in the trucks and drive , caravan style , into Pembroke for a late lunch at the Buttercup . <p> By the time they were done and driving back , the day was on its way out and Osby was starting to feel the letdown that hits after an event , just because it 's over . His tie crammed in his shirt pocket and lumpy against his chest , he drove behind Carl , a few other trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As they neared Harts Run , the vehicles turned off onto side roads , one by one , leaving dust where the gravel spilled out onto 33 . As he passed by Alva 's store , the last car behind him pulled over at the pumps . The road , suddenly empty in his rearview mirror , seemed to lengthen behind him . A few miles later , the taillights on Carl 's truck glowed and his friend 's thick arm jutted out the driver 's side window , hand casually open . Osby raised a couple fingers off his steering wheel and watched the mud-freckled Ford turn off onto 288 . Nothing in his windshield now but the wide valley and the long black line of asphalt cutting through it . Well , Osby thought , that 's that . <p> Before going home , he decided to check on each of the five small herds they ran . In his head , he corrected himself : the herds I run . He wound along through lingering patches of sunlight and the sudden , cold shadows behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field his dad-now he-rented from Sheldon Ballard alongside the government land . The ground was freezing up again , and the truck rocked and bumped over the pasture . Spread out below the hill , the cattle turned toward the engine noise all at once , the way a flock of birds rises in unison at some imperceptible signal . Osby got out and bunched his thick neck a little further into his collar . It was going cold , fast . The sunlight was at its deepest orange , just before it went red . It always looked to Osby like it should be at its warmest then , and it seemed to him a major flaw , a failing of someone 's , somewhere , that the light contained no heat at all . He watched the cows as the shadows crept out of the swales and covered the herd . He had just shy of a quarter of his beef pastured in this field : twenty-eight reddish-brown cows , four of them already calved . Mostly Angus-Lemosine , some with a little Hereford in them . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the house so he could keep an eye on them . He and his father bred all their bulls and they ran them regular . They had a two-year-old Black Angus in with this bunch . At the fringes of the herd , Osby spotted a new dropped calf suckling from its mother . She was a good cow , had given them eight or nine calves-those wide Lemosine hips-and now he tried to remember what his father would have called her . The name did n't come to him . He scanned the rest of the herd , looking for signs of compaction , foot evil , making sure all the calves were there . A few of the cows were showing bags beneath their tails and he watched them negotiate their legs under swollen bellies . One or two looked as if they might drop their calves anytime , but they were old pros . The swath of hay he 'd rolled out that morning was still catching the sun at the top of the hill . Everything looked fine . Everything looked the same . <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The moon had n't yet risen . There were no lights on in his house . He drifted past the driveway , wishing there was one more pasture to check on or something he had to do in town . Maybe he 'd drive over to Carl 's place , just to say hello ; it had been years since they 'd sat on Carl 's back porch , drinking beer and throwing sticks for his bird dogs . As he rounded the bend , his headlights sucked the Old House 's mailbox out of the night . It had collapsed against the giant chestnut stump and the letters his grandmother had carefully painted were half gone ; they read he Ca ills , now . He braked , his ribs suddenly feeling too small for all the stuff that had to fit in his chest . Slowly , he turned onto the dirt . A few feet up , he stopped . The truck idled under him . Grass and weeds had grown between the tire tracks and last spring 's rains had gouged the driveway . Up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old House stood blackly against the stars , a hole in the sky . His home , the newer house he and his dad had lived in , had been built nearly a century ago , but the original family place , the Old House , was twice that age , the walls in its living room still made of logs from the homesteaders ' one-room cabin . After his grandmother died , his father used the house for storage : bags of fertilizer , car batteries , cattle medicines . <p> Osby flicked on his brights . The windows that still had glass flared . He had n't been in there since the day he found his father . He could make out the glinting shape of Cortland 's pickup , parked at the top of the driveway . The front door to the house was still open . He 'd forgotten to shut it . Or the ambulance guys had . Or the cops . They had come , looked things over . There was n't much guessing to do . Osby asked them not to clean it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would help him seal the thing shut , he said , put a cap on it . When the neighbors offered to take care of things , he told them he 'd already scrubbed and swept and burned what had to be burned . Truth was , he had n't touched a thing in there . The idea of going back in made his bowels go watery . <p> The truck sputtered , and he gave it a little gas , shook a cigarette out of a pack of Winstons , and sat , smoking . He knew he ought to go up there and close that door . <p> When Osby 's mother died , his father had n't let anyone help them take the body to the funeral home . They had wrapped her in the sheets and carried her downstairs , his father holding her under her arms , Osby clutching her cold ankles . She had smelled like old cabbage . Her body sagged , heavy as wet sand . His thin twelve-year-old forearms strained and he struggled to keep his fingers locked around her legs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels thwacked the hard wood step , and he had thought how much that would hurt if she was alive . Outside , they hoisted her into the pickup and drove into town . His father had n't even let people gather in the house after the funeral . He had refused the casseroles and cakes they brought . <p> The next Saturday , Osby had helped him with an excavating job and they had sat in the bulldozer 's shovel , out of the cold wind , passing a thermos of steaming coffee between each other . " Ai n't going to have ' em walking all over our place , " Osby 's father had said . " Big show . " And a week later , in the kitchen , digging shotgun pellets out of a rabbit with the tip of a knife : " When I go , I do n't want no noise about it . Do n't want the whole of ' em traipsing around , tearing up the driveway , snooping around the Old House . Just dig a hole and dump me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osby rolled down his window , tossed out the butt , shoved down on the clutch , and put the truck in first . Behind the Old House , Bowmans Ridge , solid and black , smothered the bottom edge of the sky . After a while , his left calf muscle started to shake . He shifted into reverse , backed up onto the road , and drove home . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
