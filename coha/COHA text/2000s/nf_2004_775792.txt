Guidelines for Living // " The world is too much with us , " Wordsworth wrote in 1807 , and his phrase has taken on a whole new meaning in the twenty-first century . In fact , the old boy would probably be running for cover if a time machine whisked him to streets full of people rushing about as though there were no tomorrow  --  many of them yelling into small metal objects held to their ears . // It would be easy for us to sympathize with him . While scientific and medical advancements have made life easier over the years , the stresses and strains that have come with population density , technological advancements , all-pervasive news and entertainment media , and a redefinition of the family have resulted in a whole new set of challenges . People behave no worse than they used to ( rudeness and other social offenses are nothing new ) , but the pressures of modern life make it all the more difficult to stay civil . // What 's needed for this day and age ? New guidelines for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems that " anything goes . " It 's true that a more casual approach to dressing , communicating , and entertaining has taken hold , but that 's hardly something to be concerned about . The history of human interaction is one of change , and manners by their very nature adapt to the times . Today 's guidelines help steer our behavior as we move through our daily routines  --  no matter what difficulties we face , how informal the occasion or event , or which surprises are sprung . In fact , it can be said that we need manners more than ever to smooth the way . // Although today 's manners are more situational , tailored to particular circumstances and the expectations of those around us , they remain a combination of common sense , generosity of spirit , and a few specific " rules " that help us interact thoughtfully . And as fluid as manners are ( and always have been ) , they rest on the same bedrock principles : respect , consideration , and honesty . // Respect . Respecting other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their background , race , or creed . A respectful person would also never treat a salesperson , a waiter , or an office assistant as somehow inferior . Respect is demonstrated in all your day-to-day relations  --  refraining from demeaning others for their ideas and opinions , refusing to laugh at racist or sexist jokes , putting prejudices aside , and staying open-minded. // Self-respect is just as important as respect for others . A self-confident person is n't boastful or pushy but is secure with herself in a way that inspires confidence in others . She values herself regardless of her physical attributes or individual talents , understanding that honor and character are what really matter . // Consideration . Thoughtfulness and kindness are folded into consideration for other people . Consideration also encapsulates the Golden Rule : Do unto others as you would have them do unto you . Being thoughtful means thinking about what you can do to put people at ease , while kindness is more about acts . Taken together , these qualities lead us to help a friend or stranger in need , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Honesty . Honesty has more to do with ethics than etiquette , but the two are intertwined . What could be more unmannerly than being deceptive ? Honesty ensures that we act sincerely and is also the basis of tact : speaking and acting in ways that wo n't cause unnecessary offense. // A tactful person can say something honest about another person without causing great embarrassment or pain . In other words , tact calls for both empathy and benevolent honesty : " I like the other bathing suit on you better " is honest , while " That bathing suit makes you look fat " may be equally true but amounts to an insult . // Two Other Essential Qualities // Graciousness and deference are also part and parcel of mannerly behavior . Graciousness is the ability to handle situations with aplomb and flexibility , while showing deference can be as easy as removing one 's hat in a place of worship . // The mark of a gracious person is his ability to put people at ease and spare them any embarrassment . ( You 're being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say , " Oh , please do n't feel bad ! I 'm always drawing a blank when I try to remember names . " ) It 's easy to forget that " gracious " is the adjective form of " grace , " which dictionaries variously define as " good will ; favor " ; " thoughtfulness toward others " ; and " a sense of what is right and proper . " By any definition , grace is a quality anyone should strive to achieve . // Deference is primarily a means of recognizing a person 's experience and accomplishments . Courtesies like standing when an older person enters a room , giving a senior executive the head seat at a conference table , and addressing authority figures by their titles and last names ( unless they specifically request otherwise ) do not demean anyone . Far from it . Deferring politely reflects well on the person who defers by demonstrating that he values other people for their achievements . // Actions Express Attitude // People who really pay attention to others have little trouble translating what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empathetic  --  able to relate emotionally to the feelings of others . They listen closely to what people say . They observe what is going on around them and register what they see . A selfcentered person might say , " I know exactly how you feel " to someone in a traumatic situation and then immediately start describing his own experiences . An empathetic person is more likely to say something like , " I ca n't know how you feel right now , but I can understand your grief or anger or sadness . And if you want to talk about it , I 'm here to listen . " // This concern for others leads to another characteristic of courteous people : They are flexible  --  willing to adjust their own behavior to the needs and feelings of others . This does n't mean that well-mannered people are pushovers or lack strongly held principles ... //
