Chapter OneBY THE TIME Red O'Brien finished his thirteenth beer , he could hardly see through his rifle scope . Worse yet , his partner , Billy Don Craddock , was doing a lousy job with the spotlight . " Dammit , Billy Don , we ai n't hunting raccoons , " Red barked . " Get that light out of the trees and shine it out in the pastures where it will do me some good . " Billy Don mumbled something unintelligible , kicked some empty beer cans around on the floorboard of Red 's old Ford truck , and then belched loudly from way down deep in his three-hundred-pound frame . That was his standard rebuttal anytime Red got a little short with him . The spotlight , meanwhile , continued to illuminate the canopy of a forty-foot Spanish oak . Red cussed him again and pulled the rifle back in the window . Every time they went on one of these poaching excursions , Red had no idea how he managed to get a clean shot . After all , poaching white-tailed deer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wits and guile . It had been apparent to Red for years that Billy Don came up short in all of these departments . " Turn that friggin ' light off and hand me a beer , " Red said . " Do n't know what we 're doing out here on a night like this anyhow , " Billy Don replied as he duginto the ice chest for two fresh Keystones . " Moon ai n't up yet . All the big ones will be bedded down till it rises . Any moron knows that . " Red started to say that Billy Don was an excellent reference for gauging what a moron may or may not know . But he thought better of it , being that Billy Don weighed roughly twice what Red did . Not to mention that Billy Don had quite a quick temper after his first twelve-pack . " Billy Don , let me ask you something . Someone walked into your bedroom shining a light as bright as the sun in your face , what 's the first thing you 'd do ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Billy Don said , smiling . He considered himself quite glib . " Okay , " Red said patiently , " then what 's the second thing you 'd do ? " " I 'd get up and see what the hell 's going on . " " Damn right ! " Red said triumphantly . " Do n't matter if the bucks are bedded down or not . Just roust ' em with that light and we 'll get a shot . But remember , we wo n't find any deer up in the treetops . " Billy Don gave a short snort in reply . Red popped the top on his new beer , revved the Ford , and started on a slow crawl down the quiet county road . Billy Don grabbed the spotlight and leaned out the window , putting some serious strain on the buttons of his overalls , as he shined the light back over the hood of the Ford to Red 's left . They had gone about half a mile when Billy Don stirred . " Over there ! " Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run down into his crotch . He did n't even notice . Billy Don was spotlighting an oat field a hundred yards away , where two dozen deer grazed . Among them , one of the largest white-tailed bucks either of them had ever seen . " Fuck me nekkid , " Red whispered . " Jesus , Red ! Look at that monster . " Red clumsily stuck the .270 Winchester out the window , banging the door frame and the rearview mirror in the process . The deer did n't even look their way . Red raised the rifle and tried to sight in on the trophy buck , but the deer had other things in mind . While all the other deer were grazing in place , the buck was loping around the oat field in fits and starts , running in circles . He bounced , he jumped , he spun . Red and Billy Don had never seen such peculiar behavior . " Somethin 's wrong with that deer , " Billy Don said , using his keen knowledge of animal behavioral patterns . " Bastard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Red said . " I 've got him . Just shoot . Shoot ! " Red was about to risk a wild shot when the buck finally seemed to calm down . Rather than skipping around , it was now walking fast , with its nose low to the ground . The buck approached a large doe partially obscured behind a small cedar tree and , with little ceremony , began to mount her . Billy Don giggled , the kind of laugh you 'd expect from a schoolgirl , not a flannel-clad six-foot-six cedar-chopper . " Why , I do believe it 's true love . " Red sensed his chance , took a deep breath , and squeezed the trigger . The rifle bellowed as orange flame leapt out of the muzzle and licked the night , and then all was quiet . The buck , and the doe of his affections , crumpled to the ground while the other deer scattered into the brush . Seconds passed . And then , to the chagrin of the drunken poachers , the huge buck climbed to his hooves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained on the ground . " Dammit , Red ! You missed . " " No way ! It was a lung shot . I bet it went all the way through . Grab your wirecutters . " Knowing that a wounded deer can run several hundred yards or more , both men staggered out of the truck , cut their way through the eight-foot deerproof fence , and proceeded over to the oat field . Each man had a flashlight and was looking feverishly for traces of blood , when they heard a noise . " What the hell was that ? " Billy Don asked . " Shhh . " Then another sound . A moaning , from the wounded doe lying on the ground . Billy Don was spooked . " That 's weird , Red . Let 's get outta here . " Red shined his light on the wounded animal twenty yards away . " Hold on a second . What the hell 's wrong with its hide ? It looks all loose and ... " He was about to approach the deer when they both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Help me . " Without saying a word , both men scrambled back toward the fence . For the first time in his life , Billy Don Craddock actually outran somebody . Seconds later , the man in the crudely tailored deer costume could hear the tires squealing as the truck sped away . Just as Red and Billy Don were sprinting like boot-clad track stars , a powerful man was in the middle of a phone call . Unfortunately for the man , Roy Swank , it was hard to judge his importance by looking at him . In fact , he looked a lot like your average pond frog . Round , squat body . Large , glassy eyes . Bulbous lips in front of a thick tongue . And , of course , the neck-or rather , the lack of one . It was as if his head sat directly on his sloping shoulders . His voice was his best feature , deep and charismatic . Roy Swank had relocated to a large ranch southwest of Johnson City , Texas , five years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislators in Austin . The locals who knew or cared what a lobbyist was never really figured out what Swank lobbied for . Few people ever had , because Swank was the type of lobbyist who always conducted business in the shadows of a back room , rarely putting anything down on paper . But he and the entities he represented had the kind of resources and resourcefulness that could sway votes or help introduce new legislation . So when the rumors spread about Swank 's retirement , the entire state political system took notice-although there were as many people relieved as disappointed . After lengthy consideration ( his past had to be weighed carefully-life in a county full of political enemies might be rather difficult ) , Swank purchased a ten-thousand-acre ranch one hour west of Austin . Swank was actually planning on semiretirement ; the ranch was a successful cattle operation and he intended to maintain its sizable herd of Red Brangus . He had even kept the former owner on as foreman for a time . But without the busy schedule of his previous career , Swank became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great passions he enjoyed as a young adult : deer hunting . The hunting bug bit , and it bit hard . He spent the first summer on his new ranch building deer blinds , clearing brush in prime hunting areas , distributing automatic corn and protein feeders , and planting food plots such as oats and rye . It paid off the following season , as Swank harvested a beautiful twelve-point buck with a twenty-two-inch spread that tallied 133 Boone &; Crockett points , the scoring standard for judging trophy bucks . Not nearly as large as the world-renowned bucks in South Texas , but a very respectable deer for the Hill Country . Several of his closest associates joined him on the ranch and had comparable success . Swank , never one to do anything in moderation , decided that his ranch could become one of the most successful hunting operations in Texas . By importing some key breeding stock from South Texas and Mexico , and then following proper game-management techniques , Swank set out to develop a herd of whitetails as large and robust-and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenal success . After all , money was no object , and the laws and restrictions that regulated game importation and relocation melted away under Swank 's political clout . After four seasons , not only was his ranch ( the Circle S ) known throughout the state for trophy deer , he had actually started a lucrative business exporting deer to other ranches around the nation . Swank was tucked away obliviously in his **25;94;TOOLONG ranch house , on the phone to one of his most valued customers , at the same moment Red O'Brien blasted unsuccessfully at a large buck in Swank 's remote southern pasture . " They went out on the trailer today , " Swank said in his rich timbre . He was sitting at a large mahogany desk in an immense den . A fire burned in the huge limestone fireplace , despite the warm weather . He cradled the phone with his shoulder as he reached across the desk , grabbed a bottle of expensive scotch and poured himself another glass . " Four of them . But the one you 'll be especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went on to describe the " magnificent beast . " Swank grunted a few times , nodding . " Good . Yes , good . " Then he hung up . Swank had a habit of never saying good-bye . By the time he finished his conversation , a man who sounded just like Red O'Brien had already made an anonymous call to 911.
