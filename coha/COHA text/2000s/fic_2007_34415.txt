Behind the wheel of the Ford Expedition , Amy Redwing drove as if she were immortal and therefore safe at any speed . In the fitful breeze , a funnel of golden sycamore leaves spun along the post-midnight street . She blasted through them , crisp autumn scratching across the windshield . For some , the past is a chain , each day a link , raveling backward to one ringbolt or another , in one dark place or another , and tomorrow is a slave to yesterday . Amy Redwing did not know her origins . Abandoned at the age of two , she had no memory of her mother and father . She had been left in a church , her name pinned to her shirt . A nun had found her sleeping on a pew . Most likely , her surname had been invented to mislead . The police had failed to trace it to anyone . Redwing suggested a Native American heritage . Raven hair and dark eyes argued Cherokee , but her ancestors might as likely have come from Armenia or Sicily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lack of roots did not set her free . She waschained to some ringbolt set in the stone of a distant year . Although she presented herself as such a blithe spirit that she appeared to be capable of flight , she was in fact as earthbound as anyone . Belted tothe passenger seat , feet pressed against a phantom brake pedal , Brian McCarthy wanted to urge Amy to slow down . He said nothing , however , because he was afraid that she would look away from the street to reply to his call for caution . Besides , when she was launched upon a mission like this , any plea for prudence might perversely incite her to stand harder on the accelerator . " I love October , " she said , looking away from the street . " Do n't you love October ? " " This is still September . " " I can love October in September . September does n't care . " " Watch where you 're going . " " I love San Francisco , but it 's hundreds of miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll be there in ten minutes . " " I 'm a superb driver . No accidents , no traffic citations . " He said , " My entire life keeps flashing before my eyes . " " You should make an appointment with an ophthalmologist . " " Amy , please , do n't keep looking at me . " " You look fine , sweetie . Bed hair becomes you . " " I mean , watch the road . " " This guy named Marco-he 's blind but he drives a car . " " Marco who ? " " Marco something-something . He 's in the Philippines . I read about him in a magazine . " " Nobody blind can drive a car . " " I suppose you do n't believe we actually sent men to the moon . " " I do n't believe they drove there . " " Marco 's dog sits in the passenger seat . Marco senses from the dog when to turn right or left , when to hit the brakes . " Some people thought Amy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . Then he had realized he was wrong . He would never have fallen in love with an airhead . He said , " You are n't seriously telling me that Seeing Eye dogs can drive . " " The dog does n't drive , silly . He just guides Marco . " " What bizarro magazine were you reading ? " " National Geographic . It was such an uplifting story about the human-dog bond , the empowerment of the disabled . " " I 'll bet my left foot it was n't National Geographic . " " I 'm opposed to gambling , " she said . " But not to blind men driving . " " Well , they need to be responsible blind men . " " No place in the world , " he insisted , " allows the blind to drive . " " Not anymore , " she agreed . Brian did not want to ask , could not prevent himself from asking : " Marco is n't allowed to drive anymore ? " " He kept banging into things . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame Antoine . " " Antoine who ? " " Antoine the dog . I 'm sure he did his best . Dogs always do . Marco just second-guessed him once too often . " " Watch where you 're going . Left curve ahead . " Smiling at him , she said , " You 're my own Antoine . You 'll never let me bang into things . " In the salt-pale moonlight , an older middle-class neighborhood of one-story ranch houses seemed to effloresce out of the darkness . No streetlamps brightened the night , but the moon silvered the leaves and the creamy trunks of eucalyptuses . Here and there , stucco walls had a faint ectoplasmic glow , as if this were a ghost town of phantom buildings inhabited by spirits . In the second block , lights brightened windows at one house . Amy braked to a full stop in the street , and the headlights flared off the reflective numbers on the curbside mailbox . She shifted the Expedition into reverse . Backing into the driveway , she said , " In an iffy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastest exit . " As she killed the headlights and the engine , Brian said , " Iffy ? Iffy like how ? " Getting out of the SUV , she said , " With a crazy drunk guy , you just never know . " Joining her at the back of the vehicle , where she put up the tailgate , Brian glanced at the house and said , " So there 's a crazy guy in there , and he 's drunk ? " " On the phone , this Janet Brockman said her husband , Carl , he 's crazy drunk , which probably means he 's crazy from drinking . " Amy started toward the house , and Brian gripped her shoulder , halting her . " What if he 's crazy when he 's sober , and now it 's worse because he 's drunk ? " " I 'm not a psychiatrist , sweetie . " " Maybe this is police business . " " Police do n't have time for crazy drunk guys like this . " " I 'd think crazy drunk guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , heading toward the house once more , she said , " We ca n't waste time . He 's violent . " Brian hurried after her . " He 's crazy , drunk , and violent ? " " He probably wo n't be violent with me . " Climbing steps to a porch , Brian said , " What about me ? " " I think he 's only violent with their dog . But if this Carl does want to take a whack at me , that 's okay , ' cause I have you . " " Me ? I 'm an architect . " " Not tonight , sweetie . Tonight , you 're muscle . " Brian had accompanied her on other missions like this , but never previously after midnight to the home of a crazy violent drunk . " What if I have a testosterone deficiency ? " " Do you have a testosterone deficiency ? " " I cried reading that book last week . " " That book makes everyone cry . It just proves you 're human . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened . A young woman with a bruised mouth and a bleeding lip appeared at the threshold . " Ms. Redwing ? " she asked . " You must be Janet . " " I wish I was n't . I wish I was you or anybody , somebody . " Stepping back from the door , she invited them inside . " Do n't let Carl cripple her . " " He wo n't , " Amy assured the woman . Janet blotted her lips with a bloody cloth . " He crippled Mazie . " Mouth plugged with a thumb , a pale girl of about four clung to a twisted fistful of the tail of Janet 's blouse , as if anticipating a sudden cyclone that would try to spin her away from her mother . The living room was gray . A blue sofa , blue armchairs , stood on a gold carpet , but a pair of lamps shed light as lusterless as ashes , and the colors were muted as though settled smoke from a longquenched fire had laid a patina on them . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be as ordered and cheerless as this room . " Crippled Mazie , " Janet repeated . " Four months later , he . . . " She glanced down at her daughter . " Four months later , Mazie died . " Having begun to close the front door , Brian hesitated . He left it half open to the mild September night . " Where is your dog ? " Amy asked . " In the kitchen . " Janet put a hand to her swollen lip and spoke between her fingers . " With him . " The child was too old to be sucking her thumb with such devotion , but this habit of the crib disturbed Brian less than did the character of her stare . A purple shade of blue , her eyes were wide with expectation and appeared to be bruised by experience . The air thickened , as it does under thunderheads and a pending deluge . " Which way to the kitchen ? " Amy asked . Janet led them through an archway into a hall flanked by dark rooms like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as firmly attached as a remora to a larger fish . The hall was shadowy except at the far end , where a thin wedge of light stabbed in from a room beyond . The shadows seemed to ebb and flow and ebb again , but this phantom movement was only Brian 's strong pulse , his vision throbbing in time with his laboring heart . At the midpoint of the hallway , a boy leaned with his forehead against a wall , his hands fisted at his temples . He was perhaps six years old . From him came the thinnest sound of misery , like air escaping , molecule by molecule , from the pinched neck of a balloon . Janet said , " It 'll be okay , Jimmy , " but when she put a hand on the boy 's shoulder , he wrenched away from her . Trailed by her daughter , she proceeded to the end of the hall and pushed the door open , and the stiletto of light became a broadsword . Entering the kitchen behind the two women and the girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light was the golden retriever sitting alertly in the corner between the cooktop and the refrigerator . The dog seemed to shine . She was neither pure blond nor the coppery hue of some retrievers , but clothed in many shades of gold , and radiant . Her undercoat was thick , her chest deep , her head beautifully formed . More compelling than the dog 's appearance were her posture and attitude . She sat erect , head lifted , alertness signified by a slight raising of her pendant ears and by the ceaseless subtle flare-andquiver of her nostrils . She did n't turn her head , but she shifted her eyes toward Amy and Brian-and at once refocused on Carl . The man of the house was at the moment something less than a man . Or perhaps he was only what any man eventually might become when guided by no hand but his own . When sober , he probably had a neighborly face or at least one of those faces that , seen by the thousands in city streets , is a bland mask of benign indifference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . Now , as he stood beside the kitchen table , his face was full of character , though of the wrong kind . His eyes were watery with drink and blood , and he looked out from under a lowered brow , like a bull that sees on every side the challenge of a red cape . His jaw hung slack . His lips were cracked , perhaps from the chronic dehydration that afflicts an alcoholic . Carl Brockman turned his gaze on Brian . In those eyes shone not the mindless aggression of a man made stupid by drink , but instead the malevolent glee of a chained brute who had been liberated by it . To his wife , in a voice thick with bitterness , he said , " What 've you done ? " " Nothing , Carl . I just called them about the dog . " His face was a snarl of knotted threats . " You must want some . " Janet shook her head . " You must really want some , Jan . You do this , you know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As though embarrassed by the evidence of her submissiveness , Janet covered her bleeding mouth with one hand . Crouching , Amy called to the dog . " Here , cutie . Come here , girl . " On the table stood a bottle of tequila , a glass , a salt shaker in the shape of a white Scottish terrier , and a plate holding slices of a fresh lime . Raising his right hand from his side and high above his head , Carl revealed a tire iron . He gripped it by the pry end . When he slammed the tool down hard upon the table , slices of lime leaped from the plate . The bottle of tequila wobbled , and the ice rattled in the glass . Janet cringed , the little girl stoppled a cry with her thumb , Brian winced and tensed , but Amy just continued to coax the retriever to come to her . The dog was neither startled nor made fearful by the crash of iron on wood . With a backhand swing of the tool , Carl swept everything off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tequila splashed , glass shattered , and the ceramic Scottie scattered salt across the floor . " Get out , " Carl demanded . " Get out of my house . " Amy said , " The dog 's a problem . You do n't need a problem dog . We 'll take her off your hands . " " Who the hell are you , anyway ? She 's my dog . She 's not yours . I know how to handle the bitch . " The table was not between them and Carl . If he lurched forward and swung the tire iron , they might be able to dodge a blow only if the tequila made him slow and clumsy . The guy did n't look slow and clumsy . He seemed to be a bullet in the barrel , and any wrong move they made or wrong word they spoke might be the firing pin that sent him hurtling toward them . Turning his malevolent gaze upon his wife , Carl repeated , " I know how to handle the bitch . " " All I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor thing a bath . " " She did n't need a bath . " Pleading her case but careful not to argue it , Janet said , " Carl , honey , she was filthy , her coat was all matted . " " She 's a dog , you stupid skank . She belongs in the yard . " " I know . You 're right . You do n't want her in the house . But I was just , I was afraid , you know , afraid she 'd get those sores like she did before . " Her conciliatory tone inflamed his anger instead of quenching it . " Nickie 's my dog . I bought her . I own her . She 's mine . " He pointed the tire iron at his wife . " I know what 's mine , and I keep what 's mine . Nobody tells me what to do with anything that 's mine . " At the start of Carl 's rant , Amy rose from a crouch and stood staring at him , rigid and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an expression he could not name . She was transfixed but not by fear . Pointing the tire iron at Amy now , instead of at his wife , Carl said , " What are you staring at ? What 're you even doing here , you dumb bitch ? I told you Get out . " Brian put both hands on a dinette chair . It was n't much of a weapon , but with it , he might be able to block the tire iron . " Sir , I 'll pay you for the dog , " Amy said . " You deaf ? " " I 'll buy her . " " Not for sale . " " A thousand dollars . " " She 's mine . " " Fifteen hundred . " Familiar with Amy 's finances , Brian said , " Amy ? " Carl transferred the tire iron from his right hand to his left . He flexed his free hand as if he had been gripping the tool with such ferocity that his fingers had cramped . To Brian , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm her architect . " " Fifteen hundred , " Amy repeated . Although the kitchen was not too warm , Carl 's face glistened with a thin film of greasy perspiration . His undershirt was damp . This was a drunkard 's sweat , the body struggling to purge toxins . " I do n't need your money . " " Yes , sir , I know . But you do n't need the dog , either . She 's not the only dog in the world . Seventeen hundred . " " What 're you-crazy ? " " Yeah . I am . But it 's a good crazy . Like , I 'm not a suicide bomber or anything . " " Suicide bomber ? " " I do n't have bodies buried in my backyard . Well , only one , but it 's a canary in a shoe box . " " Somethin 's wrong with you , " Carl said thickly . " His name was Leroy . I did n't want a canary , especially not one named Leroy . A friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but his shabby little cage , so I took him in , and he lived with me , and then I buried him , though I did n't bury him until he was dead because , like I said , I 'm not that kind of crazy . " Under his brow , Carl 's eyes were deep wells with foul water glistening darkly at the bottom . " Do n't mock me . " " I would n't , sir . I ca n't . I was pretty much raised by nuns . I do n't mock , do n't take God 's name in vain , do n't wear patent-leather shoes with a skirt , and I have such an enlarged guilt gland that it weighs as much as my brain . Eighteen hundred . " As Carl transferred the tire iron from his left hand to his right , he turned it end for end , now gripping it by the lug socket . He pointed the pry end , the sharp end , at Amy , but said nothing . Brian did n't know if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . More than once , he 'd seen Amy talk an angry dog out of a snarl , into a belly rub ; but he would have bet his last dollar that Carl was n't going to lie on his back and put all four in the air . " Two thousand , " Amy said . " That 's as much as I have . I ca n't go any higher . " Carl took a step toward her . " Back off , " Brian warned , raising the dinette chair as if he were a lion tamer , although a lion tamer would also have had a whip . To Brian , Amy said , " Take it easy , Frank Lloyd Wright . This gentleman and me , we 're building some trust here . " Carl extended his right arm , resting the tip of the pry bar in the recess between her collarbones , the blade against her throat . As though unaware that the point of a deadly weapon was poised to puncture her esophagus , Amy said , " So-two thousand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be eating filet mignon for a while . That 's okay . I 'm more a hamburger kind of girl , anyway . " The wife-beater was a chimera now , only part angry bull , part coiled serpent . His gaze was sharp with sinister calculation , although his tongue was not forked , it slipped between his lips to test the air . Amy said , " I knew this guy , he almost choked to death on a chunk of steak . The Heimlich maneuver would n't dislodge it , so a doctor cut his throat open there in the restaurant , fished the blockage out . " As still as stone , the dog remained alert , and Brian wondered if he should take his lead from her . If the bottled violence in Carl was about to be uncorked , surely Nickie would sense it first . " This woman at a nearby table , " Amy continued , " she was so horrified , she passed out facedown in her lobster bisque . I do n't think you can drown in a bowl of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexion , but I lifted her head out of it anyway . " Carl licked his cracked lips . " You must think I 'm stupid . " " You might be ignorant , " Amy said . " I do n't know you well enough to say . But I 'm totally sure you 're not stupid . " Brian realized he was grinding his teeth . " You give me a check for two thousand , " Carl said , " you 'll stop payment on it ten minutes after you 're out the door with the dog . " " I do n't intend to give you a check . " From an inside jacket pocket , she withdrew a wad of folded hundred-dollar bills held together by a blue-and-yellow butterfly barrette . " I 'll pay cash . " Brian was no longer grinding his teeth . His mouth had fallen open . Lowering the tire iron to his side , Carl said , " Something 's for sure wrong with you . " She pocketed the barrette , fanned the hundred-dollar bills , and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , took the money , and counted it with the deliberateness of a man whose memory of math has been bleached pale by tequila . Relieved , Brian put down the dinette chair . Moving to the dog , Amy fished a red collar and a rolled-up leash from another pocket . She clipped the leash to the collar and put the collar on the dog . " Nice doing business with you , sir . " While Carl was conducting a second count of the two thousand , Amy tugged gently on the leash . The dog rose at once and padded out of the kitchen , at her side . With her little girl in tow , Janet followed Amy and Nickie into the hallway , and Brian went after them , glancing back because he half expected Carl to find his rage again and pick up the tire iron . Jimmy , the keening boy , was silent now . He had moved from the hallway to the living room , where he stood at a window in the posture of a prisoner at his cell bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stooped beside him , spoke to him . Brian could n't hear what she said . The front door was open , as he had left it . With the dog prancing smartly at her side , Amy soon joined him on the porch . Standing on the threshold , Janet said , " You were . . . amazing . Thank you . I did n't want the kids to see . . . see it happen again . " Her face was sallow in the yellow light of the porch lamp , and the whites of her eyes had a jaundiced tint . She looked older than her years , and tired . " You know , he 'll get another dog , " Amy said . " Maybe I can prevent that . " " Maybe ? " " I can try . " " Did you really mean what you said when you first answered the door ? " Janet looked away from Amy to study the threshold at her feet , and shrugged . Amy reminded her : " You wished that you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook her head . Her voice lowered almost to a murmur . " What you did in there , the money was the least of it . The way you were with him-I can never do that . " " Then do what you can . " She leaned close to Janet and said something that Brian could not hear . Listening intently , Janet covered her split and swollen lip with her right hand . When Amy finished , she stepped back , and Janet met her eyes once more . They stared at each other , and although Janet did n't say a word or even so much as nod , Amy said , " Good . All right . " Janet retreated into the house with her daughter . Nickie seemed to know where she was going , and moved forward on her leash , leading them off the porch , to the Expedition . Brian said , " You always carry two thousand bucks ? " " Ever since , three years ago , I would n't have been able to save a dog if I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That first one cost me three hundred twenty-two bucks . " " So sometimes to rescue a dog , you have to buy it . " " Not often , thank God . " Without command or encouragement , Nickie sprang into the cargo space of the SUV . " Good girl , " Amy said , and the dog 's plumed tail swished . " That was crazy , what you did . " " It 's only money . " " I mean letting him put the pry bar to your throat . " " He would n't have used it . " " How can you be sure ? " " I know his type . He 's basically a pussy . " " I do n't think he 's a pussy . " " He beats up women and dogs . " " You 're a woman . " " Not his type . Believe me , sweetie , in a pinch , you 'd have whupped his ass in a New York minute . " " Hard to whup a guy 's ass after he embeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tailgate , she said , " Your skull would be fine . It 's the tire iron that would 've been bent . " " Let 's get out of here before he decides he should have held out for three thousand . " Flipping open her cell phone , she said , " We 're not leaving . " " What ? Why ? " Keying in three numbers , she said , " The fun 's just getting started . " " I do n't like that look on your face . " " What look is that ? " " Reckless abandon . " " Reckless is a cute look for me . Do n't I look cute ? " The 911 operator answered , and Amy said , " I 'm on a cell phone . A man here is beating his wife and little boy . He 's drunk . " She gave the address . Nose to the glass , peering from the dark cargo hold of the SUV , the golden retriever had the blinkless curiosity of a resident of an aquarium bumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name to the operator . " He 's beaten them before . I 'm afraid this time he 's going to cripple or kill them . " The breeze stirred faster , and the eucalyptus trees tossed their tresses as if winged swarms spiraled through them . Staring at the house , Brian felt chaos coming . He had much hard experience of chaos . He had been born in a tornado . " I 'm a family friend , " Amy lied in answer to the 911 operator 's question . " Hurry . " As Amy terminated the call , Brian said , " I thought you took the steam out of him . " " No . By now he 's decided that he sold his honor with the dog . He 'll blame Janet for that . Come on . " She started toward the house , and Brian hurried at her side . " Should n't we leave it to the police ? " " They might not get here in time . " Vague leaf shadows shuddered on the moon-silvered sidewalk , as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But a situation like this , " he said , " we do n't know what we 're doing . " " What we 're doing is the right thing . You did n't see the boy 's face . His left eye is swollen . His father gave him a bloody nose . " An old anger rose in Brian . " What do you want to do to the sonofabitch ? " Climbing the porch steps , she said , " That 's up to him . " Janet had left the front door ajar . From the back of the house rose Carl 's angry voice and hammering and crystalline shatters of sound and the sweet desperate singing of a child . At the core of every ordered system , whether a family or a factory , is chaos . But in the whirl of every chaos lies a strange order , waiting to be found . Amy pushed open the door . They went inside . From the Hardcover edition .                 @ @ @ @
