SINGAPORE  --  Around midnight , a female impersonator in a blond wig , heels and fishnet stockings introduces himself as " MiStevious " and points a manicured fingernail at couples canoodling on the white cushioned ledges that line the walls of the 6-month-old restaurant/lounge called supperclub Singapore . <p> If the party is slow to start , supperclub 's host enlivens it by roller-skating and lip-syncing to the disco anthem It 's Raining Men . Meanwhile , fashionably dressed women and men will " have a hug and a cuddle , maybe really make out , " the U.K. native says . " It 's the place to do it . " <p> Singapore ?

" Singapore is not ( what ) we 're made out to be . You can chew your gum in public , and you can chew it loudly .

Office workers order mouth-watering gingery poached chicken served with rice and zinged up with hot sauces for $3.25 ( about 5 Singapore dollars ) , including tart , fresh lime juice to wash it down . <p> Eating is a pastime in Singapore , from the traditional morning meal of toast with a custardy , coconut jam called kaya , to an avocado smoothie snack or finger-licking meal of the national dish  --  crab smothered in chili sauce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Diner " with a cardboard likeness of Barack Obama , located in the food court at the Bugis metro station ) . <p> Singapore also is one of few places where the squeamish can feel safe ordering street food , such as dumplings and fish-head curry .
