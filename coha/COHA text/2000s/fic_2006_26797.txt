The bedroom was dark as a tomb , just a beaten-up mattress and some empty bookshelves . Bob Dylan howled " Tombstone Blues " on the box . Loud . Drifting in and out of sleep , Patch Kinkade could barely hear the ring of the telephone above Dylan 's nasal litany of the outlaw ghost of Belle Starr , Jez-ebel , Jack the Ripper , and John the Baptist . Patch stopped the CD blaster at the foot of the mattress by hitting the pause button with his big toe . He fumbled for the receiver nearby on the floor and knocked over a half-full shot glass of amber , which seeped into a stained , creaky wooden floor . Hung over a metal dinette chair was Patch 's patch . Infidelz MC . Motorcycle Club . All Harley . All men ( of course ) . Closing in on a quarter century as a member . The toughest club on the Left Coast  --  a challenging distinction the Delz were vigilant about and always defending . A gruff voice on the other end of the blower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a real person named Rancid , a longtime member and current president of the Palm Desert chapter of the Infidelz Motorcycle Club . A handful of old-guard MC members called him Henry . Some Hank . He had a small but serious emergency on his hands . " Henry . Jesus Christ , it 's after three . What the hell ? " Patch loathed middle-of-the-night phone calls , a loathing that came with age , relationships , and responsibility . Who was in trouble now ? Who 'd gotten themselves fucked up with John Law ? Three A.M. did n't used to matter . Back when Patch was an Infidelz MC officer , his phone rang at all hours  --  calls to party , calls to put out fires or to spring members from stir . Raising bail was bleeding the Infidelz MC treasury dry . The younger officers handled such tasks now , so early-morning phone calls usually meant dire emergencies . Henry ringing this early ( or late ) meant urgency . He was n't one for drama , nor was he prone to panic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shitstorm here , Chief . " Patch shook the fog out of his head . He was glad he 'd spent the day riding in the sun , washing and wrenching on his bike after a long dusty ride , working out instead of drinking himself shitfaced . " Where you calling from , Henry ? " " ' Cross town , a few miles away from the Palm Desert clubhouse . Did I wake the missus ? " " There ai n't no missus , she 's long gone . " A heavy breath into the receiver . " It 's just me and the boy . " Hollister Timmons was the surviving son of the late Oakland Infidelz rider Angelo Timmons , whom Patch brought with him when he 'd transferred from California to Arizona . Palm Desert . About a five-hour ride . " Clue me in , Hank . What 's shakin ' on your end ? " Three A.M. was no time for social chitchat . By now Hollister was wide-awake , the boy standing in the doorway of Patch 's bedroom . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the kid 's such a pessimist . Patch covered the phone with his palm . " Everything 's cool . Something 's up out in Palm Desert . I 'll handle it . You go back to sleep . You got school . " Hollister shrugged and staggered " walking Spanish " toward his bedroom . Patch was amazed at how the weedy boy had grown and filled out . He was buff and tall  --  just like his father had been  --  and judging from the intermittent nightly phone calls from giggling adolescents , it was something the girls had already noticed . " Patch ? You there , brother ? " asked the raspy voice on the phone . " Yeah , yeah , I 'm here . What 's shakin ' ? " " It 's Wrangler again . " The kickboxer champ , the NoCal Infidelz member , one of Patch 's loyal colleagues back when he rode with the club in Oakland . " What 's he doing in the desert ? He hates the dry heat . " " He 's got that girlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time between north and south . In fact , she 's the one who called us out . " " Yeah , I know her . Lacy . Sweet , sweet thing . " " Wrangler 's been a tad off the rails lately . Do n't know how she puts up with it . " " Who , Wrangler ? What else is new ? You call me at three A.M. to tell me Wrangler 's tweakin ' again ? Well , stop the fuckin ' presses . " " Seriously , last week he got done in for possession of crank and ephedrine with intent to cook . " Bummer . In earlier days , Wrangler had been a walking , talking human laboratory experiment on the prolonged use of controlled substances . Acid . Weed . Dust . Over the last ten years , he 'd cleaned up . Or more precisely , it was either clean up or die . Lately , though , just when it seemed like he was home free , Wrangler renewed his romance with home-cooked speed . " What Wrangler does on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And none of my concern . Although I wish to hell he 'd lay off that cookin ' crystal shit . " " Well , it ai n't that , exactly . He 's free on bail . " " I 'm failing to see the problem here , Henry . How much was bail set for ? " " Eleven thousand five hundred , NoCal handled that . That 's not the crisis . " " Then what the fuck is the problem ? " Henry had trouble getting to the point . " Well , he 's tweaked out of his tree right now is what , and he 's got the pretty little missus holed up with him . I suspect we got us a classic combo **30;244;TOOLONG situation . So far we 've managed to keep it low-key . Do n't ask me how . " Patch stood up from his mattress and felt another twinge of pain in his lower back . One day I 'm actually going to buy a decent bed . " So why me ? " " According to Lacy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's demanding your presence . Like I said , he 's spinning out of his gourd , and he 's got Lacy inside , God knows  --  " " Shit . " " In a nutshell . What we got is Wrangler and Lacy and a virtual arsenal and a huge cache of drugs , holed up in this here house . " " I mean shit , Henry . Why call me ? Do you think the neighbors might have called the cops ? " Continues ...
