The cereal spoon stopped midair . Rina turned to her husband . " What was that ? " " I do n't know . " The lights flickered and died along with the TV , the refrigerator , and probably everything in the house electrical . Decker reached over and picked up the portable phone . He punched in one of the landlines but got no response . Rina lowered the spoon into the cereal bowl . " Dead ? " " Yep . " Decker flicked the light switch on and off , a futile gesture of hope . It was eight in the morning and the kitchen was bathed in eastern light that did n't require electrical augmentation . " Something blew . Probably a major transformer . " He frowned . " That should n't affect the phone lines , though . " He pulled out his cell and tried to contact someone on a landline at work . With no response coming from the other end , Decker knew that the damage was widespread . The Los Angeles Police Department 's West Valley substation-Devonshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Decker lived . When this kind of thing happened , the place was a madhouse , a switchboard of panicked people with emergency lines ringing off the hook . " I should go to work . " " You did n't eat , " Rina said . " I 'll grab something fromthe machines . " " Peter , if it 's just a transformer , there is n't anything you can do about it . You 'll probably have a long day . I think you should fuel up . " There was logic to that . Decker sat back down and poured some skim milk into his cereal bowl , already laden with strawberries and bananas . " I suppose the squad room can wait another five minutes . " They ate in silence for two bites . He noticed the wrinkle in Rina 's brow . " You 're concerned about Hannah . " " A little . " " I 'll stop by the school on my way to work . " " I 'd appreciate it . " Rina tried to think of something to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids . " Cindy called yesterday . She and Koby are coming over Friday night for dinner . " " Great . " A pause as Decker finished his cereal . " How are the boys ? " " I talked to Sammy yesterday . He 's fine . Jacob only calls before Shabbos or if he 's upset . Since he has n't called , I 'm assuming everything 's okay . " Decker nodded , although his mind was racing through emergency procedure . He stood and tried the land phone again . The machine was still lifeless . " Is the den computer still plugged into a battery pack ? " " I think so . " " Let me try something . " Decker unplugged the small , portable , kitchen TV and lugged it into the back den . Rina followed and watched her husband drop to the floor and insert the electrical cord into one of the empty sockets . The seven-inch screen sprang to life . Decker tried one of the local stations . The TV was color but showed only images in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at ? " Rina asked . " A fire . " As if to underscore Decker 's pronouncement , a billowing cloud of orange flames materialized . His cell jumped to life . " Decker . " " Strapp here . Where are you ? " For the captain to be calling him on his cell , something was really wrong . " At home . I 'm just about to leave- " " Do n't come into the station . We 've got a dire situation . Plane crash on Seacrest Drive between Hobart and Macon- " " Good Lord- " " What ? " Rina asked . Frantically , Decker waved her off . " Is it Hannah ? " Decker shook his head while trying to digest the captain 's words . " . . . took down an apartment building . A few firefighters are already at the scene , but the local units are going to need reinforcements ASAP . All units are being directed to Seacrest and Belarose . We 're planning tactical . " " I 'm ten minutes away . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . " " Use it ! " The captain hung up . " What ? " Rina was pale . " Plane crash- " " Oh my God ! " Rina gasped . " It landed on an apartment- " Decker stopped talking , his ears picking up the wail of the background sirens . He glanced back at the TV screen . " Where ? " " Seacrest- " " Where on Seacrest ? " " Between Hobart and Macon . " " Peter , that 's about five minutes from Hannah 's school ! " " Go get the Volvo . I 'll convoy you over with the siren in the unmarked and then go out to the scene . " Rina 's eyes were still glued to the TV screen . Unceremoniously , Decker turned it off . " You can listen on the radio . Let 's go ! " Rina snapped out of her stupor , realizing the extent of what was to follow . A very long day followed by a very , very long night . She was n't going to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people on the plane , she would see him again . Her heart started racing , her throat clogged up with emotions , but words escaped her . Once they were outside , she found her voice . " Be careful , Peter . " He nodded , but he was n't paying attention . He opened the car door for her and she slipped inside . " I love you . " " Love you , too . And yes , I will be careful . " " Thank you . I did n't think you heard me . " " Normally , I probably would n't have , but right now I could hear a butterfly . That 's what happens when overdrive kicks in . All senses suddenly warp speed to hyperalert . " Like most private schools , Beth Jacob Hebrew Academy High School-grades nine through twelve-had recently flexed its flaccid muscles against its overindulged adolescent inhabitants . Teachers , tired of beeps , whistles , and ring tones interrupting lessons , complained to the administration that in turn passed a draconian law-according to fourteen-year-old Hannah Decker-that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception being calculators for advanced math . The ordinance had gone into effect three weeks prior-a case of poor timing because with the land phones out , the school was frantically trying to reach parents on the limited cell phones that it had . Most of the parents had an inkling that something was wrong , so by the time Decker and Rina pulled up , there was already a line of SUVs waiting to haul away the children .
