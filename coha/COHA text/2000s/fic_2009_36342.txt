Peter Aaron Kelly looked around his suite of offices and grinned . He 'd done it . He 'd made it happen . And he 'd pulled it off right on schedule . He patted himself on the back as he made his way into the private lavatory that was as big as his family 's living room back in Idaho . <p> Pete , as he liked to be called , stared at his reflection in the huge plate glass mirror that took up one entire wall of his private bathroom . He straightened the knot in his tie . Not just any knot but a Windsor knot . He loved Windsor knots because they looked so neat and finished . The suit was n't half-bad either . Custom-made Armani that draped his lanky frame to perfection . Not that he normally wore such attire , but it was a special day , and he owed it to his people to look his best . If he showed up in his jeans , a washed-out , ragged Berkeley T-shirt , and his tattered baseball cap , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Windsor knot shrieked , PAY ATTENTION . <p> The eight-hundred-pound gorilla and founder of PAK Industries continued to study himself in the mirror . No one would ever call him handsome . Nor would they say he was cute . Articles , and there were hundreds of them , said he was " interesting . " One even said he was " chameleon-like , " whatever the hell that meant . Those same articles then fast-forwarded to his financials and more or less said he could be ugly as sin because no one cared , and with all that money in the bank , he was the CIC . His secretary had to translate that for him . CIC , she said , meant Cat in Charge . If he wanted to , he could start purring right then . He laughed at the thought . <p> " Hey , Pete , you in here somewhere ? " his longtime motherly secretary shouted from the doorway . <p> Pete ran a loose ship , and as long as the work got done , he did n't care who wore what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for everyone 's comfort zone . <p> " Just checking my tie , Millie . Do you need me for something ? " <p> Hands on her plump hips , Millie stared at her boss . " Well , would you look at you ! You want some advice ? " <p> " No , but that is n't going to stop you . Spit it out . " <p> " You look silly . Ditch the duds and go back to being you . You only get dressed up like that when you go to funerals . Did someone die , and you forgot to tell me ? We always send flowers or a fruit basket . By the way , some personal mail just came for you . I put it on your desk earlier while you were getting dressed . I think it 's the third request for your RSVP in regard to your alma mater 's fundraiser . You might want to take care of that . " <p> Pete walked over to his desk to see a large , cream-colored square envelope with the return address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to get on the stick and make a decision one way or the other . <p> " Well ? So , who died ? " <p> He was off-balance . Just the sight of the cream-colored envelope and the return address rushed him back to another part of his life . A part of his life he did n't want to deal with just then . " No one died . I 'm dressed like this for the ten o'clock meeting . Then I have that photo op with Senator what's-his-name . I still do n't know how I got roped into that . " <p> His voice was so cool , so curt , Millie drew back and closed the door . She rushed around the floor warning everyone that the boss had his knickers in a twist and was all dressed up . Something was going on . The entire floor huddled as they tried to understand why the boss would attend a meeting in a suit and tie even though he was going to have his picture taken later . Peter Aaron Kelly did n't give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole world knew that . <p> " And , " Millie said importantly , " the boss is wearing Armani and not his regular hand-stitched HUGO BOSS funeral attire . Something is definitely going down this morning . He 's chipper , though , so it must be a good thing . Well , he was chipper until the mail came , " Millie muttered as an afterthought . <p> While Pete 's staff whispered among themselves , he was busy ripping open the envelope Millie had left for him . She was right , he had twenty-four hours to say yea or nay . Even at that late date they were still willing to have him as their guest speaker if he would commit . " Well , boys and girls , I do n't see that happening anytime soon . I 'll send you a check , and we 'll call it square . " To make himself feel better , he scribbled off a sizable check and tossed it in the top drawer along with the two previous invitations . Millie would take care of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter nixing the speaking gig . <p> Screw it all . Now he was in a cranky mood . He flopped down on his custom-made chair , whose leather was butter soft , and propped his feet on the desk . He had fifteen minutes to , as his mother used to put it , woolgather . He made a mental note to ask her if she still used that expression . <p> Pete opened the drawer again and reached for the invitation . He twirled the cream-colored square in his hands . Maybe he should go back . So what if he 'd made a promise to himself never to do so . People broke promises all the time , especially when the person made the promise to himself . <p> As the minute hand on his watch crawled forward , Pete slid the invitation back into the drawer . Maybe he 'd think about it later . Not too much later , he cautioned himself . The reunion was across the country in two days . <p> What the hell , he had a corporate jet . But getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole other ball game , especially on short notice . Then again , maybe he would n't think about it . He blinked when a vision of a young girl in a floppy hat with a big sunflower on it appeared behind his eyelids . Lily . Lily something . He took a minute to wonder where she was and what she was doing . She was probably married with four or five kids and a doting husband . He corrected that thought immediately when he remembered the last time he 'd seen her and the sad look in her eyes . No , he 'd bet PAK Industries that Lily something-or-other was n't married with kids . <p> Pete looked down at the calendar on his desk . He had a busy day . After the photo op with the senator , he had an appointment with his shrink . Maybe after his appointment he would be in a better frame of mind to make a decision about attending the fundraiser . <p> The pricey TAG Heuer watch on his wrist chirped . Time to head for the boardroom so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Five minutes to get downstairs to meet the senator and smile pretty for the cameras . What the hell was the senator 's name ? Then off to the shrink . After that , he was on his own time . The thought left him light-headed . <p> Precisely three minutes later , Pete entered the conference room . For some reason , the room always amazed him . It was half the size of a football field , with wraparound windows for light , and was dominated by a long teak table whose shine was so bright he could see his reflection . Twelve leather chairs surrounded the table . Off to all four sides of the large room were private groupings of chairs , small sofas , tables , and tons of greenery . In the center of the teak table was a magnificent silver coffee urn , with fine china cups and a crystal decanter of orange juice as well as four trays of assorted pastries . <p> " Hi , people , " Pete said , taking his seat at the head of the table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his side for years and years to make it all happen . He owed them all big-time . He nodded to Millie , who was trotting around the long table , placing in front of each person a snow-white envelope with the PAK logo in the corner . <p> " A show of my appreciation . Look , there 's no easy way to say this other than to come right out and say it . I 'm taking some time off . A year at the least . Maybe longer . You can run this place without me . There are some things I need to do . Personal things . So , having said that " - Pete tossed a set of keys to his second-in-command , Marty Bronson- " the keys to everything , Marty , and you get my parking space . Before you can ask , no , I am not sick , no , I am not getting married . " <p> Pete pushed back his chair and stood up . " Oh , there is one other thing . Every one of you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call me , you 're fired . I 'll check in from time to time so you can hear my cheery voice . I want to walk out of here knowing I did n't make a mistake when I hired you all . Just make me proud and let me get out of here before I start blubbering . Do n't get up . Sit there and plan how you 're going to spend those checks I just gave you . See ya ! " <p> Outside in the hallway , Millie stared at him , tears rolling down her cheeks . " That was a really shitty thing you just did in there , Peter Aaron Kelly . You should have prepared us , given some kind of warning . Everyone 's in shock . What are you going to do now , watch television ? " <p> It was the worst thing Millie could have said to her boss . Pete never watched television ; he hated it with a passion . Every day his staff tormented him with what they 'd seen on the tube that he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply right away . When he finally got his tongue to work , he said , " Call Berkeley and tell them I might or might not attend . There 's a check in my top drawer you can forward by overnight mail . Give my regrets about not being their guest speaker , say I was flattered , yada , yada , yada . I 'm going to forget that crack you just made about me watching television . C'mere , give me a big hug so I can go meet that senator . What the hell is his name ? " <p> Millie wiped at her eyes . " His name is Hudson Preston , the senior senator from California . You did n't mean me , did you , when you said you did n't want any calls from here ? I 'm sorry about my television comment . I was upset . I am still upset , Pete . " <p> Pete squared his shoulders . " Sorry , Millie , it means you , too . I need time and space . I 'll call you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of here , you big schmuck . Shame on you for making an old lady cry , " Millie said , wiping at her eyes . She did her best to summon up a smile to send Pete on his way . <p> " I love you , Millie . Keep your eye on things . I 'll be back , I just do n't know when . " Pete waved airily as he headed for the elevator . He was glad no one was looking at him when he swiped at his own eyes with the back of his hand . <p> Pete stepped out of the elevator to see the senator and his entourage milling about the spacious lobby of his building . He realized in that one second that he did not like the senator , had never liked him . <p> An aide approached him , a young guy with his share of zits and spiky hair . " It would be so much better if we could do the photo op in your corporate offices , Mr. Kelly . This lobby is so cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm and fuzzy image the senator wants to convey . This , " he said , waving his arm about , " is so ... corporate . " <p> " Sorry , rules are rules , " Pete said briskly . " Can we get on with it ? I have a meeting , and I do n't want to be late . " <p> The aide looked horrified at Pete 's words . He started to sputter . " But ... but the senator cleared his calendar for an hour . We came all the way from Washington . " <p> " It 's a forty-five-minute shuttle ride . A letter went out to your offices explaining all this . Now , let 's get on with it , or I 'll leave you all standing here to suck your thumbs . " <p> Before the aide could reply , the senator approached Pete , his personal camera crew right behind him . " Ah , Peter , nice seeing you again . " <p> Pete extended his hand and gave the senator a bone-crushing handshake . " Guess it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush you , but I have a meeting I ca n't be late for . " <p> The senator 's eyes narrowed , but he did n't lose his affability . He smiled , knowing he was being captured on film . " I understand , we allotted only fifteen minutes ourselves . I appreciate your agreeing to the op at all . I know how busy you corporate types are . " <p> Pete bared his teeth in what he hoped was a smile . " Good , that means we 're on the same page . " <p> When the allotted fifteen minutes were up , Pete looked pointedly at his watch . <p> Senator Preston threw his arm around Pete 's shoulders . " I have a limo out front . Can we drop you off somewhere ? " <p> Pete shrugged off the senator 's arm , and replied , " Thanks , but I 'm walking . " He was through the revolving door within seconds and on his way down the winding walkway . He had a bad taste in his mouth . Later he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Preston . He wondered if it had anything to do with the few visits he 'd made to the shrink . The last thing Dr. Myers had said last week when Peter was leaving his office was to think about the " why " of everything . Why did n't he like Senator Preston ? Peter did n't have a clue . <p> The trees were dressed for spring early that year . As he exited the PAK Industries campus and walked on out to the boulevard , Pete started shedding his clothing . He yanked at the power tie and stuffed it in his pocket . The only reason he knew it was a power tie was because Millie had bought it and told him so . Next came the Armani jacket . He slung it over his shoulder as he maintained his easy gait while at the same time rolling up the cuffs of his pristine white shirt . Ah , now he could breathe . He wished he 'd had the foresight to jam his baseball cap into his hip pocket . He always felt undressed without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a six-suite brick medical building with ivy growing up the bricks , all the way to the top of the second floor . He liked the look because there was something homey about it . The plaques attached to the brick were n't the standard polished brass but chunks of driftwood that were sanded , then shellacked . Dr. Harvey Myers was on the first floor . <p> Pete looked at his watch . He was one minute early . He felt proud of himself when he opened the door to the waiting room to find Harvey Myers waiting for him with a cup of coffee . Harvey handed it over . Pete laughed . " You 're spoiling me , Harvey . " <p> The easy familiarity between doctor and patient went back years and years . Harvey had once coached the PAK Industries softball team until the demands of his practice required cutting back on his outside activities . They made small talk , Pete sipping the strong black brew and Harvey drinking decaffeinated herbal tea . <p> Together , the two men moved toward the doctor 's private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then moved to a recliner that tilted backward and had a footrest . <p> Harvey set aside his herbal tea and picked up a pad and pen , but not before he turned on the portable recording machine . Pete sipped his coffee as the doctor recorded the date , the time , and the patient 's name . <p> " So , how 's it going , Pete ? You sleeping any better ? " <p> " No . I prowl all night long . No , I do n't want any sleep help . You know how I feel about pills of any kind . When my body is tired , I 'll sleep . " <p> " Did you do it ? " <p> Pete did n't ask for clarification . He knew exactly what Harvey was referring to . " As a matter of fact , I did , about an hour ago . I thought it went well . I 'm a free agent . Nice feeling . Well , I think it 's going to be a nice feeling once I get used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " No , not really . I have n't decided if I 'm going to California or not . " <p> Harvey put down the pen and pad and leaned forward . " Let 's cut the bullshit right here , Pete . You 've been coming here three times a week for a month . I ca n't help you if you wo n't open up to me . Whatever past relationship we had , inside this room , we 're doctor and patient . The fact that you actually decided to make an appointment-and kept it-tells me something is bothering you . Having said that , I want you either to tell me what 's bothering you or get the hell out of here so I can help someone who needs and wants my help . " <p> Pete looked around the comfortable office . For the first time he could hear soft music coming from somewhere . He thought he heard water trickling in the far corner . He wondered if it was something new . He asked and blinked when Harvey said the music was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank . " Am I that obvious ? " <p> " Well , yeah . I am a psychiatrist , Pete . You came here to unload , so will you get on with it ? " <p> Pete jerked at the handle on the recliner and bounced upright . He , too , leaned forward . " I made a promise to myself , and I did n't keep it . Well , I kept the first part but not the second part . I want to know if that kind of promise counts . You know , when you make it to yourself . I did n't even make an effort to keep it . I think I know why I did n't , but I 'm not sure . By the way , no one knows about it . Well , that 's not really true , someone does know . A girl I told way back when . At least I think I told her . It was a lifetime ago , Harvey . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
