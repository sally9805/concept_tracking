January 1861 * * * " We must be near Galena already , " Lon said with a look at the closed door of the baggage car . " Nothing 's happened . " " Wait , " his partner said . Sledge sat on a crated shipment , legs stuck out , the payroll bag between his heels . His boots were dirty and scarred . Lon 's were spotless except for a few streaks of slush . Around the office they called him Gentleman Lon because of his manners and neatness . He out-Englished the English operatives , of which there were several . The Chicago &; Galena express was traveling northwest , toward Dubuque across the Mississippi . Adams Express paid almost four hundred dollars a month to rent space in the line 's baggage cars . Its competitor , American Express , had similar arrangements , necessary because trains were favorite targets of thieves , and their routes crossed the territories of a legion of sheriffs who were crooks , bunglers , or both . Lon Price 's agency had contracts with both express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up ten thousand dollars a year for protection for their real estate and rolling stock . Lon and his partner were replacing a regular guard because of a robbery attempt on the same train at the same time last month . The attempt failed ; the inept holdup men had blocked the track with a flimsy barrier of barn siding . The engineer had smashed the locomotive right through without stopping . The boss had tried to persuade the Chicago &; Galena to ship its next Dubuque payroll by another train , at another time , butmanagement lived by schedules and timetables . So here they were , rolling through the winter night , waiting . Lon blew on his hands . The car was frigid even though he could see flames in the small stove . The flue pipe went out through the solid wall at the head of the car . Near the stove , the railway mail clerk sat on a stool with his elbows on the counter . All his mail was sorted in pigeonholes and he appeared to be dozing . The clerk struck Lon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss demanded . From his left pocket Lon took a well-thumbed book . Sledge Greenglass , whose given name was Philo , worked his gold-plated toothpick in a crevice in his teeth . Where Lon was fair and broad-shouldered , but otherwise slight , Sledge was taller , heavier , with curly black hair and perhaps an Italian or Greek ancestor . He was ten to fifteen years older than Lon . " What 's that ? " Sledge said with a nod at the book . " The latest by Charles Dickens . The latest novel published here , I mean . There 's a new serial running in England , Great Expectations . Dickens is my favorite writer after Edgar Poe . " Lon showed the book 's spine . " A Tale of Two Cities . Invite him over , maybe he 'll write A Tale of Two Countries . " Sledge 's sarcasm was justified . The Union was collapsing .

The problem would confront the President-elect , whom Lon had met once in Chicago . He was a downstate lawyer who had for a while represented the Illinois Central . Lon wondered if such a peculiar , ugly man could do anything to save the country from war . The locomotive whistled mournfully . The train creaked and rattled around a bend . Three oil lamps hanging from the ceiling swayed and smoked . The car reeked of old cigars . Lon read half a page , then read it twice more . He shut the book and made a face . Sledge said , " Nervous ? " " Some . I 've only been at this for a couple of years . Do you ever get used to the danger ? " They noticed the mail clerk watching . Sledge lowered his voice .

The boss had met them , liked them , and hired them away . Sledge continued , " I been shot at , knifed , mauled in the line of duty maybe a dozen times . And no , I 'm not used to it . But even if they hit us tonight , I would n't worry too much . Holdup men are n't only crooked , most of them are stupid . Look how they mucked up last time . The rule is , no matter how scared you are , no matter what your belly 's telling you , keep it hid and always give back more than you take . That 's how you stay alive . That 's how you win .

All hymns , holiness , heaven and hallelujah . " " Listen , Sledge . My father was a good man . He cut his life short trying to help Negroes escape to Canada . He was even shot once by slave-catchers . You can say anything you want about me but keep still about him . " " Sorry . Forgot my manners . Police work slaps ' em out of you pretty fast . " Lon was silent . Sledge changed the subject . " Think those Southron hotheads will start a war ? " " I hope not . They ca n't be allowed to destroy the Union . They ca n't go on enslaving an entire race and breaking up families for profit . The Negroes have got to be free . " " And then we 'll all invite a few of them to our parlors for tea ? Like they was white ? I doubt it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot his hand up for silence . He eyed the car ceiling . Lon heard faint thumps , moving toward the blind end of the car next to the tender . " Someone 's up there . " Sledge turned back his coat and put a hand on the butt of the shiny new Remington .36-caliber stuck in his belt . Lon carried a smaller Colt , a .31-caliber pocket pistol , a city weapon ; a gentleman 's gun . " Bastards are already on the train , " Sledge said . " Sons of bitches bought their own tickets . " He ran to the wide door and slid it open . Icy wind blew in , and a few snowflakes . Outside , snow-covered fields flashed by , lit by the moon . Trees by the right-of-way slashed the side of the car like whips . Sledge hung on and leaned out , trying to see whoever was clambering down over the tender to force the engineer to stop the train . Someone else would uncouple the rest of the cars , and the engineer would pull the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car would be looted . In the corner of his eye Lon saw the clerk open a drawer . " Sledge , watch out ! " The Colt .31 snagged in the lining of Lon 's pocket . The clerk pulled a revolver from the drawer and pointed it at Sledge 's embroidered vest . " You stand still . I mean it . " The car was freezing , the wind moaning and tossing snowflakes in , yet the clerk 's pale face ran with sweat . " Put your hands in the air . " Sledge obeyed . " They bought themselves a worm inside , " he sneered . Lon freed the pocket Colt . He stood with his left side toward the clerk , who was so nervous he either missed the movement of Lon 's right arm or did n't know what to do about it . Lon heard a noise to his right , the door at the rear of the car . He wheeled , gun in hand . A lanky man in a black , floppy hat and long , fur-collared coat stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys . Get their pieces , Vernon . " The clerk stayed at arm 's length as he pulled Sledge 's Remington from his belt . Sledge looked mad enough to bite the clerk 's arm off . Visibly trembling , the clerk turned around toward Lon . Sledge threw an arm around the clerk 's neck and pulled him against his chest as the other man fired . In the next coach passengers screamed . Sledge was a hair faster than the gunman , shoving the clerk forward and dropping to the floor . The gunman 's round killed the clerk instantly . He fell on his side near the open door . The train curved into another bend , losing speed . The ceiling lanterns swayed , flinging shadows across the walls . Lon turned right to present a narrow target . He shot the older gunman a second before the gunman could fire . Lon 's round went low , catching the gunman in his middle . He fell face forward . His revolver spun away out of his hand . It landed a foot and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day coach were louder . The drive wheels shrieked on the rails . Even if the man in the cab had the engineer and fireman at bay , he would n't know what the shots meant . The gunman on the floor made whimpering sounds . His hat had fallen off , revealing long , stringy , gray hair and a sizable bald spot . To Lon , recently turned twenty-three , he looked old and somehow pitiable . Lon moved to pick up the man 's revolver but turned around when Sledge snarled , " Goddam . Bet there 's just two of themtwo , and this slug . " He shoved the clerk with his scuffed boot ; the body dropped out the door . " You need four or five to pull a train robbery . I told you holdup men are stupid . " Sledge peered past Lon . " For Christ 's sake , shoot that one . " " Why ? He 's down .

In his two years with the agency Lon had only been in one other shooting scrape , and he shook as much now as he had then . Sledge hung from the door of the car and shouted . " Hey , you , jackass ! You up there in the cab . Both your pals are dead . They 're dead , get that ? " The baggage car moved over a level crossing with a lamplit farmhouse nearby . The shouted reply was faint but clear because the locomotive had slowed down . " Who is that ? " " Operative Greenglass of the Pinkerton agency . You know , the Eye . There 's two of us and one of you . The clerk and the old man are goners . You better get off and save yourself . " " We should take him into custody , " Lon said . " How ? Time I climb up there , he 's liable to kill the driver or the fireman . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm willing to try it . " Sledge gave him a sharp look . " I think you would . You 're a damn polite fellow , but you 've got sand . " He leaned out the door again . " Jackass ? Listen here ! " The locomotive and train had stopped . Sledge 's shout was followed by a heavy , slamming sound . A moment later they heard the engineer : " Feeny brained him with his shovel . He 's out . " Sledge stepped back in the car and laughed . " All accounted for , then . " He picked up the canvas payroll bag . " The C-and-G boys around Dubuque will get their pay . I 'd say it 's a fine night 's work . " " Two men are dead . " Lon could n't feel any of Sledge 's pleasure . Sledge shrugged . " Remember what the boss says . The end justifies the means if the end is justice . " " Mr. Pinkerton says a lot of things I admire , but that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll figure out that we 're in a dirty line of work . " Sledge walked over and clapped Lon on the shoulder . " In the meantime , we make a pretty good team . "
