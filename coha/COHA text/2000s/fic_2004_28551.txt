Chapter One " DO N'T SNAP AT ME , " Edie Robinson 's mother said as Edie maneuvered Maude 's elderly Chevrolet Nova into the parking lot of the Little Hills IGA . " No one asked you to come back . You 're busy , we all know that . You 've got an important job . Nobody expects anything from you . All I said was I needed toilet paper - " " You told me four times , Mom . " " Why would I have said limes ? " Maude 's voice was indignant . " I would n't know what to do with a lime if it bit me on the nose . I need toilet paper and ... denture cleaner , " she added in a conspiratorial whisper . " But if you 're going to snap at me , forget it . Viv will take me . Viv can always make time , not that she is n't busy , too , but all I have to do is pick up the phone and - " " Viv walks on water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Maude would have shot back if she 'd heard anything more than a muffled jumble of words . " You 've always been sarcastic , Edith . " With her right hand , Edie massaged the knot of tension in the back of her neck that usually only hit her when she procrastinated on a deadline , and cruised the lot for a parking space close to the market entrance . She watched a woman in pink tights and a maternity top load groceries and three small kids into a minivan . God . Three kids and the woman had to be at least fifteen years younger than she was . Edie glanced in the rearview mirror , frowned at the vertical lines around her mouth and thought to hell with it . When the van finally pulled away , Edie slid into the spot , switched off the ignition and turned in the seat to look directly at her mother . Maude was eighty and , despite the late-summer Missouri heat , wore a black woolen cardigan over a cotton housedress blooming with improbably vivid peonies . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hose . For some reason , the sight of Maude 's tiny slipper-clad feet and swollen ankles made Edie want to weep . She reached over and scooped up Maude 's left hand in her own . Maude 's felt soft and almost boneless , fingers clutched around a wad of tissue . " I did n't mean to snap at you , " Edie said . " I 'm sorry . " Her chin trembling , Maude scrabbled for the door handle . " You 've always had a short temper , Edith . I said to Viv just the other day , I never know what 's going to set Edith off . You 'll have to come and open this door for me , it sticks . You 're just like your father in that way . " She pushed ineffectively at the door . " Viv said she 'd have Ray look at it - " " Mom , leave the door alone . I 'll open it for you . You need to get rid of this damn car . Unless , " she muttered facetiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Ham . " Maude clutched her purse close to her chest . " They 've got that sliced ham on sale . I like a slice of ham for dinner . Ca n't eat anything too heavy before I go to bed , or I 'm up all night with heartburn . Viv tell you about the new principal at Ray 's school ? " " She mentioned him . " An understatement . From the moment Viv picked her up at the airport the night before , her sister had talked about little else . Peter Darling : English , wife died of cancer , four small children , collects butterflies , Ray says he wo n't last . Too pie-in-the sky . Twenty years of journalism had trained her to isolate and retain the salient facts of any information she was given . She 'd retained these particular snippets because the idea of raising four small children with or without a spouse appalled her and because she 'd probably meet Peter Darling tomorrow when she gave a talk to students at the school . Her brother-in-law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late last night and she 'd agreed before she realized she did n't particularly want to do it . Too late now . She grabbed the keys , got out of the car and walked around to the passenger side . Waves of heat rose up from the parking lot . A line of sweat trickled down her back , pasting her cotton shirt to her skin . It had been nearly midnight when she 'd stepped out of the airport and the warm , moist temperature had hit her like a slap in the face . This morning , the relentlessly cheerful weatherman on Maude 's ancient Magnavox had announced that the day promised to be another scorcher , even hotter than yesterday . She 'd snapped off the set as he 'd been yammering on about the misery index . No one expects anything from you . She pulled open the heavy door and leaned inside to unfasten her mother 's seat belt . Maude 's hair , soft and fine as cobwebs , brushed against her cheek . Edie caught a whiff of mothballs and peppermint candy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Mom ? You miss me sometimes . Do n't you ? " Okay , there you go . " She stood back and extended her hand ; Maude ignored it . " Going to be another hot day , " she said as Maude slowly swung her legs around . " You 're going to bake in that sweater . Want me to help you off with it ? " " Do n't rush me . " Maude 's little pink slippers were gingerly touching down on the asphalt . " I know you 're in a hurry , you 're always in a hurry , but it takes me a while these days . " " Take your time , Mom . I 'm not going anywhere . " Her mother 's face was flushed with heat and exertion and , as she helped her out of the car , Edie slid her palm under the shoulder of Maude 's black sweater and felt damp warmth . " Let me help you take it off , Mom . You 'll be more comfortable . " Maude shook off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll need my sweater . " " You got it . " Her arm linked in Maude 's , they made their way slowly across the parking lot . " Okay , toilet paper , denture cleaner and ham . Is that it ? " " Yams ? " Maude shook her head . " Get some for yourself if you want , I wo n't eat any . " She turned her pale blue eyes on Edie . " You probably ate that sort of thing in ... where was it you were last ? I ca n't keep up with all the places you 're off to . I said to Vivian , no wonder Edith never married . What man would want to go traipsing around the world after her ? " " I 'll get you a basket . " At the entrance to the store , Edie separated a cart from the line and wheeled it over to Maude . " There you go . Want me to push it for you ? " " I need it to lean on . " Maude elbowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick as I can , " she said as they progressed sedately along the dairy aisle . " Just do n't lose your temper with me . There 's no call for it . Vivian does n't snap at me the way you do , she knows it takes me longer these days . She said to me when we knew you were coming , she said , " Mom . Edith 's just going to upset you the way she always does . " Viv thinks about these things . " Edie bit the inside of her lower lip very hard and sent a prayer aloft . Please , please give me patience . Half of my sister 's saintliness would help , too . And please , please , I know it 's too late to expect much in the way of mother-daughter bonding . I know we 're not going to snuggle up in bed for heart-to-heart talks over mugs of cocoa , but please , please , let this be a ... pleasant visit . And please , please , do n't let me snap at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place . ( Continues ... )
