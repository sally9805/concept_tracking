Are girls picking on boys ? Since December , radio talk-show host and men's-rights activist Glenn Sacks has rallied followers to target a division of the David &; Goliath line of clothing , which Sacks claims is antiboy . One T shirt features a cartoon image of a boy running from flying rocks , with text that reads , " Boys are stupid , throw rocks at them ! " Some stores , including Bon-Macy 's , have pulled the shirts . " They are part of a larger trend of male and father bashing , " says Sacks . " Stopping the sale of these shirts is an initial blow to the boy-bashing culture . " David &; Goliath president Todd Goldman says the shirts are meant to be fun . " The cartoon boy is just like Charlie Brown , " he says . " Remember how Lucy used to torment him with the football ? " <P>  --  By Isabel C. Gonzalez
