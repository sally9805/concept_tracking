. 1 Ruffed Grouse and Woodcock WISCONSIN A town of barely 3,000 People , Park Falls claims a big distinction : It bills itself as the Ruffed Grouse Capital of the World . They 're not just talking the talk , either ; hunters walk the walk across 1.2 million acres of prime grouse real estate , all of it open to the public . Even last year , as Wisconsin 's grouse cycle hit bottom , guide Terry Ides recorded an average of 26.3 flushes a day in coverts within a 40-mile radius of Park Falls . A bad year in Price County is better than a good year almost anywhere else . THE PLACE Although the 800,000-acre Chequamegon National Forest comprises the bulk of open land around Park Falls , locals in the know deem the best hunting to be found on the area 's 90,000 acres of county land , or on the 135,000 acres of nearby state forest . While logging on national forests has become a highly volatile , politicized off-and-on-again practice , Wisconsin 's county and state forest managers have a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the benefit of grouse and woodcock populations . In addition to public lands , hunters can also try the Plum Creek Paper Co. ' s 150,000 acres of actively logged woods . THE HUNT When the season opens on September 13 , visitors will find leaves on the trees and grouse bunched in early-season flocks . Early October is the prime time to visit , as visibility improves and grouse disperse into their fall range . Grouse and woodcock inhabit young forest . Although their preferred habitats differ , they overlap in much of the area . " I have a rule of thumb , " says Ides . " If I can put my hands around a tree and the fingers touch , it 's woodcock cover . If they do n't touch , it 's grouse cover . Even 25-year-old stands of aspen and alder are okay , so long as they 've got good growths of thorn apple or chokecherries around them for the grouse to eat . " Come ready to walk . Ides ' clients regularly tramp 10 to 12 miles a day . Fortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow you down . On the other hand , it all looks alike . It 's easy to get turned around if you 're not paying attention . " You ca n't just mark your truck on your GPS and find your way back . This is swamp country , and you ca n't always walk out in a straight line , " says Ides . He suggests that first-timers stick to the edges of logging roads and clear-cuts , where they 'll find more birds anyway . Bring plenty of ammunition . Last year Ides ' hunters averaged 1.3 birds with a typical expenditure of 44 shells in the thick cover . Run into woodcock and you can pop even more caps . On a good day , you may find 20 or 30 timberdoodles in a morning 's hunt . Although Park Falls actively promotes its hunting , Ides says there 's so much open land available that he and his guides rarely encounter other hunters in the field .

" North of U.S. 2 , the whole state is one big grouse covert , " says Bill Pierce of the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife . That highway marks the boundary between the endless northern forests and the population centers , urban refugees , and sprawl of southern Maine . Local ruffed grouse populations bounce up and down but remain largely uninfluenced by the boom-and-bust cycles of the Great Lakes . Grouse hunting here ranges from fair to phenomenal , but it never bottoms out as it can in the Upper Midwest . THE PLACE Immediately adjacent to U.S. 2 , you 'll find classic New England-style grouse hunting in farm country replete with picturesque stone walls and abandoned apple orchards . Although it 's technically legal to hunt any unposted land in Maine , common courtesy suggests that you find the farmer and ask permission before putting your dogs down . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're in the big woods , where millions upon millions of acres of paper-company land stand open to public access . These lands are , in general , well marked , both with signage and obviously used logging roads . You need n't ask permission to hunt them , although a group of smaller paper companies , known as the Northern Maine Woods , charges modest gate fees for access to their land , which is often prime grouse cover . As always , the best habitat will be found in the young growth around clear-cuts . THE HUNT " You can be absolutely clueless and still find great grouse hunting in Maine , " says Pierce . " Drive down the road until you see bird cover or even a grouse alongside the road . " He is n't suggesting that you road-hunt . " I look at that bird as the one that sold his whole clan out , because that 's where I 'll put the dog down and start hunting . That one bird might lead you to another , or to an alder patch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll have to hike up and down as you hunt , the hills and mountains provide plenty of landmarks , making it somewhat more difficult to get lost among the trees than it is in the flat , featureless grouse woods of the Great Lakes . Where to go ? Here are three suggestions : Aroostock County is as north as the North Woods get and has great grouse covers . The tiny town of Jackman in western Maine opens its arms to visiting upland hunters . The entire Kennebec River corridor provides excellent mixed-bag grouse and woodcock hunting . Maine 's grouse season opens October 1 and runs through the end of the year . October is prime time , usually coinciding with the best woodcock hunting in the bottomland alder runs .

Hunting them on their own ground is not like hunting them on shooting preserves  --  and is not for the faint of heart or the weak of leg . Coveys run fast up steep hills and either drop over the other side of the ridge or flush back over your head and fly back down below you . Hunters in the know climb hard to get above the birds , then spread out along the top and hunt across the hillsides . Why put yourself and your dog through such early-season misery ? Because chukar hunting in Idaho has never been better than right now . THE PLACE Chukars need water , rimrock , and cheatgrass . They find all three in abundance along Idaho 's rivers and impoundments . Currently , Brownlee Reservoir , an impoundment of the Snake , rules as Idaho 's premier chukar spot . Helicopter surveys of Brownlee show numbers well above long-term averages . To hunters , that might translate into 10 to 12 coveys a day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lower Snake , and Lower Salmon Rivers all support good surrounding populations as well . THE HUNT You can go by land or by water . Hunters with access to a boat cruise the shorelines early in the season , looking and listening . Once they spot birds down by the water , they land the boat , climb above them , and start hunting . If you can break up a covey , the singles and pairs will sit well for a dog . For hunters without a boat , the simple drill is to park , climb , and hunt , concentrating your efforts wherever you find rocks and cheatgrass together . Before you go , find a StairMaster for yourself and one for your dog . Dog boots are essential in rocky terrain . Choose leather ones , as a Cordura pair can wear out in half a day . Carry drinking water for you and your dog . Idaho 's season opens September 20 and runs through January 15 . Many prefer to go early , counting on summer drought to concentrate birds low along rivers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coveys . " It does n't matter when you go , " says biologist Andy Ogden . " If you 've got the legs and the dog , you can find birds from the beginning of the season right up until the end . " RESOURCES The state discourages outfitters from offering upland bird hunts . Chasing chukars is a do-it-yourself deal .

You step into a flock of prairie grouse , and a bird blasts out of the grass in front of you , two more flush off to the side , and five jump up somewhere else , in random , discombobulating order . You might fill your limit in a few seconds ; you might just empty your gun . Hunters who walk the grasslands for sharptails and chickens , the two species of prairie grouse , pay a high price for their birds in sweat and boot leather . Yet , they come here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vastness and the chance to follow their dogs across the wide open spaces . THE PLACE The Fort Pierre National Grasslands just south of Pierre cover 160,000 acres and have become perhaps the nation 's premier destination for prairie grouse hunters . Recent management changes geared to multiple use instead of just grazing have improved the area 's bird cover . State lands , Corps of Engineers ground , and private acres leased under South Dakota 's walk-in program also offer open access to hunters . Unfortunately , dry weather in 2001 and 2002 hurt prairie grouse production . At press time , the prairies were cool and wet again , but South Dakota Game , Fish and Parks biologist Tony Leif says hunters should keep their fingers crossed . " Conditions looked better this spring , but a lot can happen between July and September 20 . " While South Dakota has become the most popular prairie grouse destination , Nebraska rates a close second , especially if you 're interested in a mixed bag of chickens and sharptails . In northwest Nebraska , there 's no shortage of federally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Forest near Halsey ; the 115,000-acre McKelvie National Forest southwest of Valentine ; parts of the 71,000-acre Valentine National Wildlife Refuge and the 40,000-acre Crescent Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Garden County . THE HUNT As you evaluate prairie grouse cover , look for land that has n't been grazed too heavily . Leif sums up good habitat this way : " The grass has to be tall enough for them to hide in , but short enough for them to see out of and allow them to run or flush . " Sharptails and chickens prefer slightly different habitat . " Chickens are more of a pure grassland bird , " Leif says . " You 'll find them out in the open , while sharptails are more often associated with draws and shrubby hillsides . " Typically , sharptails roost on ridge tops , then move down along the hillsides to feed in the morning , often spending the heat of the day seeking shade in clumps of bushes . Hot weather often finds birds reluctant to flush and usually makes for the best pointing dog work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more in South Dakota . Start early in the cool of the morning , and be ready to take a break at midday . Carry plenty of water for the dogs to prevent overheating , and plan your hunt as a series of one-hour circles back to the vehicles so you can refill and switch to fresh dogs if you have them . Whenever you find and flush birds , try to mark them if you do n't get a shot . Early in the season they may only fly a couple hundred yards before they pitch back into the grass . If you 're able to scatter a covey , you may find the singles sitting tight and waiting for you to walk them up . Last tip : Bring a fishing rod . The classic Pierre cast-and-blast consists of hunting sharptails all day , then fishing for walleyes below the Lake Oahe dam in the evening .

Illustration <p>                     @x In Chicago , the snow was falling so hard that , although quite a few pedestrians saw the woman standing on the fire escape nine stories up , none were sure they recognized her . At first the woman leaned against the railing and looked down , as if calculating the odds of death from such a height . After a minute or two , though , when she had n't climbed the rail but had instead stepped back from it , most people who 'd noticed her continued on their ways . She did n't look ready to jump , so why keep watching ? And how about this snow , they said . What the hell ? It was n't supposed to snow like this in spring ! <br> To the few who watched her a minute longer , it was conceivable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the popular talk show host whose show was taped inside the building . Conceivable , but unlikely . Was Blue Reynolds 's hair that long ? That dark ? Why would Blue be standing there motionless on the fire escape , looking up into the sky ? Such a sensible , practical dynamo of a person  --  she certainly was n't the type to catch snowflakes on her tongue , as this woman now appeared to be doing . And especially not when The Blue Rey <br> nolds Show was going to start in twenty minutes . Tourists who 'd hoped for last-minute tickets were right this second being turned away , the studio was full , please check the website for how to get tickets in advance . <br> This snow , coming two days after spring had officially begun , had the effect of bringing people throughout the city to windows and doorways  --  and to fire escapes , apparently . Though six to eight inches was forecasted , it was hard to begrudge snow like this , flakes so big that if you caught one on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perfect as a newborn baby 's hand . And with tomorrow 's temperatures rising into the fifties , what snow was piling up on railings and rooftops and ledges would melt away . It would be as if this remarkable snowfall had never happened at all . Much like the sighting of Blue  --  if in fact it was Blue  --  there outside her studio building 's ninth floor . <br> The black steel fire escape stood out against the buff-colored limestone , an add-on when the building got transformed from bank to apartments in 1953 . Now that it housed offices again , its fire escape made balconies for those lucky enough to have access along with their downtown skyline views . Like a switchback trail , the escape descended from the twelfth-story rooftop to the second floor , with landings at each floor . The landing on which the woman stood was piled with a good three inches of snow , deep enough to close in on her ankles and soak the hem of black crepe pants . Her boots , Hugo Boss , lambskin , three-inch heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she stood with her face upturned , she was vaguely aware that her feet were growing cold . Still , the pleasure of being pelted by snowflakes held her there . She could not recall the last time she 'd been in , truly in , weather like this . And never alone , it seemed , and never focused , anymore , on the weather . Standing here , she had the exquisite feeling of being just one more anonymous Chicago dweller . Just a forty-ish woman on a fire escape in the snow , and not Blue Reynolds at all . <br> This snow made her want to be a child again so that , instead of going home to a bowl of Froot Loops eaten while she reviewed reports , she would be preparing to pull on snow pants and boots and head for the lighted hillside at the park , plastic saucer sled in tow . She would return home later soaking wet , with chapped red cheeks and frozen toes and a smile that would still be on her face when she woke the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered , or a wish ? <br> She knew the snowflakes must be wetting her just-styled hair , spotting her white silk blouse , Escada , she 'd put it on not fifteen minutes earlier . These thoughts , they existed outside her somehow , far enough away that they did n't motivate her to climb back inside her office window  --  even as today 's guests waited downstairs in the green room , nervous about meeting her . Even as the camera and lighting and sound and recording crews were gearing up for this last show of the week . Even as three hundred eager audience members were now taking their seats and would soon meet Marcy , Blue 's right hand , Marcy who managed her life , who would tell them what to expect on today 's show . They would n't expect a snow-wet , distracted Blue Reynolds . <br> Still , even when she heard someone tapping the window to get her attention , she stood there squinting up into the whitened sky . One more minute . One more . <br> The tapping , again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . <br> Inside , the stylists and her producer and her assistants fluttered around her , clucking like outraged hens . What are you doing , it 's practically showtime ! Look at that blouse ! Are you sure you 're okay ? No . She was n't okay , had n't been truly okay ever , that she could recall . <br> What expectation she saw on the faces of her studio audience when she took the stage ! It was n't her they 'd come to watch ; she never lost sight of that . Because she was a regular person who argued with her mother , who cleaned hair from her shower drain so that the cleaning lady did n't have to . She was a woman who failed to floss , who needed to clean out her purse , who paged through People at the dentist 's office , just like most of them . They were here to see the woman who , upon seeing that magazine , could then book whoever interested her and interview them on this very stage . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover herself . <br> On today 's show were a sociologist , a high school superintendent , a Christian minister , and three teens  --  one boy and two girls . One of the girls was eight months pregnant . The topic was abstinence education . <br> In talking with Peter , TBRS 's producer , about this show , Blue had protested his suggestion that she open with an audience poll . Getting the audience involved in hot-button issues had in the past led to a Jerry Springer  --  like atmosphere she had to work hard to redirect . Peter said , yes , but think of the drama . " We want people to engage , " he said . " And not only because it 's good for ratings . " She agreed in part ; engagement was the point of it all , or was supposed to be the point . <br> He continued , " You saw the latest numbers . We 're slipping  --  just a little , and obviously we 'll bring it back up , but if we lose our edge right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratings also led to lower ad revenues , lower production budgets , more difficulty in booking guests who had the power to draw viewers  --  all of which then trickled down to lower salaries for everyone on her payroll . Lower salaries meant good people jumped onto newer , flashier , competing ships . Ultimately , she 'd agreed to do the poll . <br> Standing at the front of the stage , she welcomed the audience . Three hundred faces of all skin tones and both genders watched her eagerly , fans from any and every place on Earth . Beyond , too , she sometimes suspected . While Marcy claimed there was an angel in every audience , Blue rather thought there was an alien , who would inevitably write in to rant about how ? offbase she 'd been on a particular topic , even if that topic was the fifty best uses of phyllo . <br> " Let me introduce you to some typical teens , " Blue said , and the two teenage girls appeared from the wings to take their seats behind her . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eye makeup and TV-modest clothing bearing popular-brand logos . Both girls were white . <br> Facing the audience , she said , " Kendra and Stacey  --  who is eight months pregnant  --  are seventeen-year-olds from intact middle-class families . Their parents are professionals . Both girls are B-students , involved in extracurricular activities "  --  this drew a chuckle from some of the audience  --  " and both have made preliminary plans to attend college . The main difference in these young women 's lives is that one of them attends a high school that follows an abstinence-only curriculum , and one attends a school where teenage sexuality is considered ' normal ' and the students are educated accordingly . Abstinence is taught as one of several possible choices . <br> " She stepped down from the dais and walked to the lip of the stage . " With a show of hands : Which of you thinks Stacey , our pregnant teen , got the sex-is-normal message ? " <br> About half of the audience raised hands . <br> " Now , who thinks Kendra did ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the volume of voices , arguments already begun . <br> Blue waited a beat , resisting the urge to rub her face . Looking into Camera 4 , she said , " The answer , when we come back . <br> " She allowed the rumbling to continue during the break , hoping the audience would get it out of the way now ; things were not going to get better . <br> Taking a seat between the girls , she looked at each of their nervous faces . " Are you hanging in there ? " <br> Kendra shrugged . Stacey shifted in her chair and smoothed her pink maternity top . " I 'm okay , I guess , " she whispered . <br> In a moment , they were on-air again . Blue said , " With me today are Kendra and Stacey , Chicago-area teenagers who , like most of their peers , are dealing as best they can with the pressures of growing up in our increasingly sexualized culture . <br> " Before the break I polled the audience on which of these girls received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught to abstain until marriage . " She looked at Camera 2 : " Brad , give us that tight view  --  audience , watch the screen . <br> " She waited , knowing that on the screen behind her would be a close-up image of a girl 's left hand , on which there was a silver ring . Brad nodded , and Blue continued , " This is known as a purity ring , representing adherence to the abstinence ideal : a vow of chastity , a promise to wait for the right man  --  or woman , because some young men are wearing them , too  --  and marriage . <br> " Girls , raise your hands . <br> " Of the four hands now displayed , three were bare of jewelry , as they 'd arranged ahead of time . <br> The silver glinted , of course , from Stacey 's left hand . <br> Amidst the reactions of surprise from many in the audience , and satisfaction from others , a skinny , dark-haired woman in the middle of the room stood up and yelled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <br> Stacey 's face crumpled . " It 's not wrong ! I love him , " she said , then burst into tears . <br> And before Blue could stop herself , she did , too . <br> After refereeing fifteen rounds between the sociologist and the minister  --  had Peter chosen such a closed-minded , sanctimonious old man on purpose ?  --  Blue escaped the set the minute they were clear . Reverend Mark Masterson , a tall , self-serious man with heavy jowls and bottle-black hair , followed her backstage . <br> " Just what do you think you 're going to accomplish by telling teenage girls to go ahead and have sex ? " <br> " Was that what I said ? " <br> " You made that child out to be a hero . <br> " He 'd made no secret of his disdain for the facts and the statistics , which were the substance of her supposed endorsement . Blue looked at him coolly . " And you made her out to be a whore  --  I 'm sorry , ' whoremonger ' was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a minister , but apparently you 're a judge . " <br> He frowned down at her , his height giving him an illusion of superiority she was sure he made the most of . He said , " When I agreed to do this show , I was under the impression that you had a conscience . " <br> " And I was under the impression that someone who has committed to serving his community would at least attempt to do so . <br> " He straightened the lapels of his brown suit jacket and picked off a spot of lint . " These are children we 're talking about . They require firmness and absolutes to shut down ungodly urges . Romans chapter eight , verse thirteen , for example : ' For if you are living according to the flesh , you must die ; but if by the Spirit you are putting to death the deeds of the body , you will live . ' " <br> " So Stacey must die ? That 's a reasonable punishment . " <br> " Now let 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation . <br> " Blue nodded . " So true . Excuse me . " Giving him no chance to reply , she walked away quickly , shoulders pulled back , chin up , and shut herself in her dressing room . She 'd known there would be no easy consensus on such a complex issue , but just once she would have liked to have the kind of powers needed to instantly transform a person like Masterson into a hormonal , love-struck teenage girl . <br> Blue was pulling off her boots when Marcy joined her , looking as fresh and enthused now , at four-fifteen , as she had at eight this morning . It was more than Marcy 's white-blond hair ( " Of course it 's dyed , " she 'd told a woman in the audience during a commercial break . " Nature does n't make this color " ) , more than her flared-leg jeans and gray cashmere T-shirt . Marcy had what Blue 's mother Nancy Kucharski called " a dynamic aura , " grown even more dynamic since meeting Stephen Boyd , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created that aura , Nancy said . " It 's good for the complexion , and not bad for the rest of the body , either ! " Blue had to take her word for it  --  and an experienced word it was . <br> " Good show , " Marcy said , as though things had gone just as well as the day before , when they 'd hosted four champion dog breeders and four captivating puppies . <br> " Compared to what ? " Blue stepped out of her pants and stripped off the substitute Escada blouse ( there were two of everything , just in case ) then put on gym gear and brown velour sweats . Or rather , a brown velour track suit , as they were being called again . The seventies were back , complete with Barry Manilow and Cat Stevens and Neil Diamond on the radio , which Blue did n't mind so much . The songs were reminders of a time when she was young enough to believe she knew where she stood . <br> " I 'm serious . Except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <br> Blue shook her head , still embarrassed . " I do n't know what that was about . " " Empathy , maybe . " <br> " Is Peter having a fit ? " <br> " He 's too busy working on a spin strategy . Stacey 's still a mess though , poor thing . " <br> " I suspect she 's going to need therapy . " <br> " You did n't . " <br> " I did . I just did n't get any . " <br> Marcy reached behind Blue to straighten her hood . " Speaking of misguided youths , your mother called . She 's not coming to the Keys with us after all ; she says she met someone and he wants her all to himself this weekend . " <br> Continues ...
