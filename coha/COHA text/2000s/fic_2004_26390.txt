Tropic of Night Chapter One Looking at the sleeping child , I watch myself looking at the sleeping child , placing the dyad in a cultural context , classifying the feelings I am feeling even as I feel them . This is partly the result of my training as an anthropologist and ethnographer and partly a product of wonder that I can still experience feelings other than terror . It has been a while . I assess these feelings as appropriate for female , white , American , Anglo-Saxon ethnicity , Roman Catholic ( lapsed ) , early-twenty-first c. , socioeconomic status one , working below SES . Socioeconomic status . Having these feelings . Motherhood . Lay your sleeping head , my love , human on my faithless arm , as Auden says . Maladie de l'anthropologie , Marcel used to call it , a personalized version of Mannheim 's paradox : the ethnographer observes the informant , at the same time observes herself observing the informant , because she , the ethnographer , is part of a culture too . Then at the same time observing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the informant , since the goal is complete scientific objectivity , stripping away all cultural artifacts including the one called " scientific objectivity , " and then what do you have ? Meaning itself slips from your grasp like an eyelash floating in a cup of tea . Hence the paradox . Geertz found a theoretical solution as far as fieldwork goes , but in the heart 's core ? Not so easy . It is not all that interesting to watch a child sleep , although people do it all the time . Parents do , and perhaps also Mr. Auden , at least once . I am not , however , this child 's mother . I am this child 's mother 's murderess . The child : female , ethnicity unknown , nationality unknown , presumed American . SES probably five : rock bottom . Four years of age , though she looks younger . In Africa there were kids of eight who looked five , because of malnutrition . Plenty of food around , but the kids did n't get any . The old folks hogged all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultural difference , there . Her skin is the palest red-brown , like bisque pottery . Her hair is black , thick , and quite straight , but dry and friable . She is still thin , her spine a string of staring knobs , her knees bulging out beyond the bones they articulate . I think her mother was starving her to death , although usually if they 're going to starve them they do it in infancy . The bruises are gone now , but the scars remain , thin cross-hatchings on the backs of her thighs and buttocks . I expect that they were made by a wire coat hanger , an example of what Levi-Strauss called bricolage : a cultural artifact used in a new and creative way . I fear brain damage , too , although so far there are no frank signs of this . She has not spoken yet , but the other day I heard her crooning to herself , in well-shaped notes . It was the first two bars of " Maple Leaf Rag , " which is what the local ice-cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that was a good sign . My own knees are rather like hers , for I am an anorexic . My condition does n't result from a neurotic defect in body image , like those pathetic young girls exhibited on the talk shows . I got sick in Africa and lost forty pounds and subsequently I 've eaten little , for I court invisibility . This is a strategic error , I realize : to become really invisible in America , a woman must become very fat . I tried that for a while and failed ; everything came up , and I worried about scarring of the esophagus . So I starve , and try to fatten the child . In my longings , I wish to be mist , or the ripple of wind on the water , or a bird . Not a gull , a class I feel has been aesthetically overrated , no ; but a little bird , a sparrow of the type God watches fall , or a swallow , like the kind we saw in Africa . We had a houseboat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its deck we would watch them come from their nests on the soft banks and fill the sky over the river in a pattern of flitting silhouettes in the ocher dusk , and in their hundreds and dozens of hundreds they would hunt the flying insects and dip to drink sips from the oily brown surface . I would watch them for their hour , and would pray that they contained the souls of women dead in childbirth , as the Fang people are said to believe . She blows a tiny bubble in her sleep , so babyish an action that my heart flows over with love and for an instant I am rejoined to my true self , not watching from outside , like an anthropologist , or a fugitive , which is another thing I am , and after that instant the fear flows back again like batter in a bowl from which a finger has been withdrawn . Affection , attachment , weakness , destruction , not allowed , not for me . Or remorse . I killed a human being . Did I mean to ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hold a knife to my throat and I 'd tell the truth : the child was doomed with her , she 's better off with me , I 'm glad the woman 's dead , God rest her soul , and I 'll answer for it in heaven along with all the other stuff . Worse stuff . Naturally , the little girl does n't resemble me in the least , which is a problem , for people watch us and wonder who did she fuck to get that one ? No , actually , that 's unfair : most people do n't see us at all , both of us are good at fading into the foliage , going gray in the shadows . We go out in the dusk , before the quick fall of the tropical night , or , as on the weekend just passing , very early . Tomorrow I will have to find a place to put her while I work . I have only a little sick time left and I need the money . She has been with me ten days . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
