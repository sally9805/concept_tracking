<p> The issue of free speech is getting a sharp test on America 's college campuses . At universities from Berkeley to Brown , a controversial ad placed in campus newspapers has pitted student publications against their readers , and freedom of expression against perceived racism . In response to the ad , which argues against giving reparations for slavery to African-Americans , student groups have protested - in one case taking thousands of papers to keep the message from getting out . Some editors have apologized for the ad , angering free-speech defenders . The conundrum has highlighted the difficulties campuses face as they try to foster both racial sensitivity and free debate . And it 's left educators and students wondering if the image of college as a place where all views can be heard is just a 1960s ideal . " There is less discussion of controversial issues on college campuses than anywhere else in society , and that 's a tragedy , " says Harvey Silverglate , co-author of " The Shadow University : The Betrayal of Liberty on America 's Campuses . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . But some experts say that just as students are being asked to be more accepting of one another , they have become less tolerant of viewpoints that challenge their own , or are not considered " politically correct . " Administrators are part of the problem , say critics like Mr. Silverglate , an attorney and adviser to Brown 's student chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union . He says schools are imposing more rules about speech that is considered harassing and looking the other way when students take actions that suppress views , like stealing papers . <p> Do n't like today 's issue ? Steal it . Theft of college papers has increased dramatically in the last decade , according to the Washington-based Student Press Law Center , which advises high school and college papers on their First Amendment rights . Before a high-profile case of paper theft in 1993 at the University of Pennsylvania , there were about a half-dozen incidents of theft per year . Since then , the number has ranged from a dozen to as many as 40 in an academic year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on campuses is changing . More students respond with disbelief and anger at the utterance of unpopular opinions , educators say . Nearly 30 campus newspapers decided not to run the anti-reparations ad offered by conservative pundit David Horowitz . But on many of the 13 campuses where the ad has appeared - including the University of California at Berkeley and at Davis , Brown University in Providence , R.I. , the University of Wisconsin-Madison , and Duke University in Durham , N.C. - protesters have charged papers with being insensitive to African-American heritage and complicating efforts to help racial groups reach common ground . " It really angered me because ... this created more of a rift between the various students on campus , " says Goldie Pritchard , a student of West African descent at UC-Davis who works at the campus Cross-Cultural Center . " I think it 's important to have a dialogue , but there are people who will take that ad at face value and not look at the whole picture . " Some student objectors have taken action to make sure their opposition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the case of Brown , taking virtually an entire press run of 4,000 papers . Since then , several editions carrying the ad have circulated . The stealing of papers troubled Carl Takei , the head of Brown 's chapter of the ACLU . He and other students formed an organization called Students of Color Against Censorship shortly after the papers were taken and took out their own ad in The Brown Daily Herald . " We were horrified that a group of students acting in the name of the minority community was suppressing dialogue and censoring opposing viewpoints , " Mr. Takei says . " We do n't believe that viewpoints should be censored because people find them offensive . " What surprises many observers is that minority groups would squelch speech , given that historically they have been most threatened by censorship . Not everyone points the finger at political correctness . Todd Gitlin , a professor of culture and communication at New York University , says students do n't have the same affection for free speech as he witnessed in the 1960s . That sentiment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's been a devaluation of reason , " Mr. Gitlin says . " Today , debate just seems like a drag . Video games are more interesting . The life of the mind and democracy have become a side show . " But Gitlin suggests this new apathy may be linked to school administrators ' growing role as fundraisers - something that makes them reluctant to let tensions between students flare and draw the ire of concerned parents and donors . " It 's a tragedy of American higher education that administrators are fundraisers , " he says . " In general , they are politicians who are looking to their monied constituencies and want to protect their multiethnic flank . " <p> Tougher guidelines on speech In the past decade , administrations have toughened guidelines for harassment and acceptable speech . The University of Wisconsin-Madison , for example , has had its current faculty speech code in place since 1999 . It states that " some hurtful expressions ... play no meaningful role in the free exchange of ideas ; they may , indeed , inhibit that exchange ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Wisconsin and the University of Virginia who now teaches a constitutional law class on church and state at the latter . He intentionally tries not offend anyone . " I feel I owe it to my students , " he says . " All of them are more likely to be able to learn than if I ran the risk of offending anyone unwittingly . " He attributes this careful treatment by him and other colleagues in part to the increasing sensitivity among students . But he defends the approach as the best way to promote learning in the classroom . In the case of the Horowitz ad , protecting speech and student sensitivities can be a difficult balancing act . Some officials responded with forums for discussion after the ad ran , others built websites offering opposing positions . " Probably over time we will change our website to include pros and cons , but for the immediate future , we thought it was important to give the student community here the message that there is another point of view , " says Jesus Trevino , director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tempe . He says the student paper , which later printed an apology , should have first offered space for opposing views . The Daily Californian at Berkeley is one of the papers criticized by free-speech advocates for apologizing for the ad . " Our position has been completely distorted , " says editor Daniel Hernandez , explaining that the editorial board did n't change its mind about the ad . It never saw it ; the business side made the decision to publish it . Free debate is very much a part of Berkeley , Mr. Hernandez says , noting that his paper often takes conservative positions . But he is critical of Mr. Horowitz 's approach , which he says aims to pick a fight rather than promote civil discourse . Hernandez also takes aim at other papers , wondering if they are getting involved with the ad to draw attention to themselves and then " preaching about the First Amendment when we have n't even mastered our craft yet . " Some educators suggest that nostalgia for the good old days in which everything could be freely discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need one institution in this world in which any question can be asked and any answer found , " says Arthur Levine , president of Teachers College at Columbia University in New York . " No institution has been closer , but universities have never been able to do this . " <p> Send email to campbellk@csps.com . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 . The Christian Science Monitor
