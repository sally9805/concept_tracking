A few things led me to mistakenly conclude that Gore had won Tuesday night 's smackdown . It was clear that Bush did n't fully understand the peril of making Russia our broker in Serbia , especially since Russia remained so sympathetic toward the defeated Milosevic . The RU 486 question tied him in knots . He did n't want to remind such a large audience that his official position on abortion is to recriminalize it if he can change enough hearts . So he fudged his earlier statement that he would seek to overturn approval of the drug , saying a President is powerless to do so against the Food and Drug Administration . He got lost in a hypothetical financial crisis and said he would hug his way out of a domestic one . On his signature tax cut , he kept criticizing " the man 's " ( that would be Gore 's ) " fuzzy math . " But when he could n't rebut the Gore argument that nearly one-half of his tax cut would end up enriching the top 1% of Americans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So where did I go wrong ? My biggest mistake was grossly underestimating the weight that would be given to any Gore exaggeration . Going in , he had been warned by the press that he had used up his lifetime allowance of melodrama with his sister 's deathbed story , with his claim to being the model for Love Story ( he was in part , the author confirmed , but Tipper was n't ) and with his boast that he took " the initiative in creating the Internet " ( although even Newt Gingrich says Gore did so in the Congress ) . Gore is assumed to be exaggerating even when he 's not . We 're hypersensitive to the flaw , having just finished seven years with his boss , who really knew how to ice the cake . <P> Gore served up several juicy targets  --  that standing-room-only classroom in Florida , Winifred Skinner 's picking up cans to buy medicine , his being in Texas during the floods with James Lee Witt . Bush 's truth squad quickly put the word out that Gore had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although he had gone on 17 other Witt trips to disaster areas ) . In fact , Kaylie Ellis is n't still standing at Sarasota High School , but her lab built for 24 is squeezing in 36 , and other students are still deskless . Kids at that other school Gore mentioned are eating lunch at 10 a.m. , not 9:30 . And when a well-off son appeared to cast doubt on Winnie 's need to recycle aluminum , she reiterated her desire not to take charity from anyone . <P> In my warped view , Gore fell within the margin of political error by scoring 95% for anecdotal accuracy , although I do n't want to suggest for a second that his overall affect , especially the sighing , did n't make me want to shake him . He looked like Sylvester Stallone , absent the Uzi , as made up by Madame Tussaud . The format brought out the worst in him . Put him in front of a podium and out of his Dockers , and he reverts to his **25;12136;TOOLONG mode , impressing the teacher with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yugoslavia . His excess verbiage actually detracts from the more important point that he would be better handling the crisis in Serbia .
