The first third of the season is in the rearview mirror , and one Big Question looms , Shaq-like , over the league : Is there a team besides the Spurs or the Pistons that can win the title ? To hear one astute observer tell it , Detroit will not be denied . " The Pistons are in a league of their own right now , " says San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich . " The rest of us better hope that they ca n't sustain it , but I do n't see why they ca n't . They 've got the best starting five in the league , they 're hungry , and they 're looking to prove something . " // Detroit plays at San Antonio next Friday , the second of the teams ' two meetings . Will that serve as a prelude to a Finals rematch ? Or can another team build momentum over the winter and topple the titans come spring ? Here 's an assessment of how the contenders stack up . // Tier 1 Finals Redux // The Pistons have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points per game through Tuesday was a 6.4-point hike from last season , and Richard Hamilton , Chauncey Billups and Tayshaun Prince had each raised his production while playing fewer minutes . The increased efficiency is a result of new coach Flip Saunders 's inventive playbook as well as his decision to divide practice time equally between offense and defense ; his predecessor , Larry Brown , leaned heavily toward D. " Now our guys know that scoring is just as important as getting a big stop , " says G.M. Joe Dumars . " It 's not unlike Tony Dungy going to the Indianapolis Colts : They already had the offense , so he brought a sense of urgency on the defensive end . We were the opposite : We had the sense of urgency on defense , so we needed to open up the offense. " // Nobody has benefited more from the change than SI 's MVP front-runner , Billups . Through Tuesday the league 's deadliest crunch-time player was averaging career highs of 19.6 points and 8.4 assists as well as an NBA-best assist-to-turnover ratio of 4.36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball just as well as he 's scoring points when they need them , " says Popovich . " He 's keeping it all together , he plays D and his team exhibits unbelievable confidence in allowing him to run the whole damn thing . " // The Spurs , at 23-7 , fell just one win short of their best 30-game start in the Tim Duncan era , despite Manu Ginobili 's eight-game absence with a right-foot injury and Duncan 's battles with plantar fasciitis . Not even an 85-70 drubbing from Detroit on Christmas had the champs down . " That was a great game for us , " says Popovich . " It gave me some fuel , something I could use as a reminder . ' Uh , guys , this is the team , and right now they 're a little more focused : They 're trying to prove something a little more than we are . ' " // Tier 1-A The Riley Factor // Talentwise , the Heat belongs in the same stratosphere as the Pistons and the Spurs . Chemistrywise ? Not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pat Riley to find a successful mix . It will take time , and the new Heat coach has plenty of that . With a division title a foregone conclusion , Riley has more than three months to tinker with the league 's most fascinating set of player combos. // The early signs have been positive . Since Riley replaced Stan Van Gundy on Dec. 12 , the Heat is 8-3 , thanks largely to the return of Shaq to the lineup . But the team has also profited from the willingness of Jason Williams , Gary Payton and Antoine Walker-all of whom are playing their best ball of the season-to assume more complementary roles . " I see a very talented team with a great , great coach who is going to use the season to come together and be ready for the playoffs , " says Dumars . " Pat Riley understands exactly what it takes . " // Tier 2 Ever on the Cusp // The Mavericks have an MVP candidate in Dirk Nowitzki and a roster thick with playmakers . But it 's their newly instilled offensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoning its quick-trigger habits , Dallas can better set up its much-improved defense . Their defensive stats may be middle of the pack , but the Mavs are better than ever at protecting the rim and rebounding. // Assuming the Pacers acquire an established player for suspended forward Ron Artest , opponents still believe that come April , Indiana will be the Team That No One Wants to Play in a Seven-Game Series . After initially indicating that it was looking for payroll relief in any Artest deal , Indiana 's front office did an about-face last week and started trolling for talent that would enable the franchise to contend this season . Already one of the league 's most versatile teams , Indiana 's specific needs are n't easy to define . The trick for Donnie Walsh and Larry Bird is to bring in new faces that will improve the team 's volatile chemistry . That type of player is n't quite as easy to identify as , say , a scorer or a big body . // Tier 3 One Big Man Away // Through Tuesday the Suns ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last season and leading the league in scoring ( 104.1 ) despite averaging just 17.6 free throw attempts , the lowest rate in league history . That average will certainly shoot up with the return of Amar ? Stoudemire , who got to the line 9.9 times per game in 2004-05 . If Stoudemire recovers from microfracture knee surgery and rejoins the Suns around the All-Star break , they 're poised to make a run . " We can match the speed of last year to go with a better defensive core , " says coach Mike D'Antoni . " We 're really optimistic about Stoudemire 's progress , but once he starts running and he 's on the floor will be the telling point . " // The Nets ended ' 05 with eight straight wins thanks to Vince Carter and Richard Jefferson , but New Jersey remains an unbalanced team : athletic on the wings and plodding in the paint . A big man who can block shots and run the floor would help-ex-Net Kenyon Martin would be perfect , but with his contract , that is n't going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper alternative , such as the Rockets ' Stromile Swift . // Scout 's Take // On guard Stephon Marbury , who at week 's end was averaging a career-low 6.3 assists for New York , which is off to its worst start since 1986-87 : // " I do n't buy the talk that Marbury is the impediment that prevents the Knicks from running Larry Brown 's system . He 's trying to do the right thing-distribute the ball , run the offense-but he does n't have the supporting cast . Marbury has been trying to win at the expense of his individual stats , but until the Knicks upgrade the players around him , he 's going to be the scapegoat . " // ?
