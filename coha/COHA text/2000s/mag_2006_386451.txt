Three-time Super Bowl champ talks about spending money , pitfalls of the NFL ana overcoming his father 's tragic death // THEY call him " Big Sey . " But at 6-foot-6 and 310 pounds , it might be a safer bet to call Richard Seymour " Big Sey , sir . " In only five seasons , the New England Patriots All-Pro defensive lineman has risen to ranks of the NFL 's elite , already winning three Super Bowls , and making four Pro Bowl appearances . He is considered by many to be the best defensive player in the league at any position . Last season , he led all defensive linemen in sacks and passes defended , even after missing four games due to injury . Earlier this year , Seymour signed a four-year contract reportedly worth $30 million , making him one of the highest-paid players in the NFL . It was a bittersweet moment for the 26-year-old , who has seen his share of ups and downs , triumphs and tragedies , during his short pro football career . His philosophy concerning football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to get better , " he says . " I never looked back at the things that I have done . Although I 've been to Super Bowls and Pro Bowls , there are still a lot of things in football that I have n't accomplished . That keeps pushing me . " Seymour says he wants to be considered one of the best to ever play the game . " So I think about history , the guys who came before me and the guys who are going to come after me , " he says . " When I look back , I want to say that I left no stone unturned . If I could do it over again , I would n't do anything different . " He admits that his aggressive play during games surprises many people who know his soft-spoken demeanor off the field . " People say , " Is that the same guy ? ' ' " Married to his high school sweetheart Tanya , the couple has three children , R.J. , 4 , Kayla , 3 , and 2-year-old Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Boston suburb . Outside of the basement , which has a pool table , an arcade-style video game , and a theater room , one would never know it was the home of a multimillion-dollar NFL player . The kids have a small playroom they share , and an average-sized jungle gym in the backyard . Tanya Seymour is a down-to-earth mother who drives a minivan , and Seymour credits her for keeping him grounded . " The mind-set I have now comes from her , " he says . " I see a lot of guys who come into the NFL , and they think if s all about the cars and the jewelry , a lot of material things that have no substance . I 've seen guys living over their means . Do n't get me wrong . I enjoy nice things , but at the same time , it does n't determine the type of person that I am . If s not about the cars , the money , the jewelry . To me it 's more about-the relationship , the character , the integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel like I have a responsibility on this football team and around the league to spread the message . Save your money and do a good job with it . Because the NFL stands for " Not For Long . ' ' " He also wants his kids to know the value of money . " If s tough to do that because you are able to get them stuff , but at the same time you do n't want to spoil them , " says Seymour , who owns a home in South Carolina , and spends much of the off-season there . In fact Seymour says that the family is on a budget one that sets aside a certain amount of money for bills , groceries and other living expenses . " Just because you have millions of dollars does n't mean you have to spend like crazy , " he says . " I live a nice lifestyle . It 's not overextravagant . It does n't matter if I can afford it . I want to live under what I can afford . That way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive , I will be able to afford it . I like to have fun . But you want to keep everything in perspective . " His modesty may come from his Southern upbringing . He comes from Gadsboro , S.C. , a small town outside of Columbia . Ifs a place where , he says , everybody knew everybody . Growing up in a loving family , he says that his father showed him tough love , while his mom was the nurturer . His father was a contractor . Seymour remembers going out to jobs with him as early as 6 years old . He says it was those early years that laid the groundwork for the type of person he is . " Nothing was handed to me . I had to go out and work for it . That Southern upbringing taught me that there is no substitution for hard work , " he says . " When I had to earn money , I was more conservative with it because I knew what it took to get it . " Seymour recalls the endless days that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his grandmother 's house , where everyone gathered around the table to eat dinner and watch football . " We had a real big football family , " he says . Although he loved the game , Seymour did n't play football until he was in ninth grade . The reason ? He was too big to play in the Pop Warner league with kids his age , so he did n't play until high school . " I realized I was bigger than the other kids when I was sitting in class in the first grade , " he says . " I was n't a bully . I was always pretty low-key . " It was n't until one of his high school coaches told him he could go to college on a football scholarship that he began to think about turning his passion into a career . One of the first in his family to go to college , Seymour attended the University of Georgia , and quickly became a standout . A housing and consumer economics major , he was drafted in the first round ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that more than anyone else , his father , Richard Seymour Sr. , was most instrumental in his growth as a person and a football player . He calls his dad " one of my best friends . " The two would talk after every game . Actually his dad , who had played high school football , would do most of the talking , telling his son what he thought about his performance . Seymour 's life changed forever in the early morning hours of April 25,2004 . That was the day that he received a call that his father was found dead after he was shot to death . As expected , Seymour took the loss of his father hard , even admitting now that at the time he thought about quitting football altogether . " That was a tough time in my life . It was after my second Super Bowl , " he says . " There was a time when I did n't know whether I wanted to play football anymore . " But with the help of his faith , family and a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although he looks at life much differently now . " I 've been through some tough times in my life , " he says . " But I have some good people in my life . The strength of the Lord got me through ... " Seymour believes God has a plan for him , a plan that he should not question or tamper with . " I call myself a child of God , " he says . " I try to live my life by the Bible . I want to be obedient . I make mistakes , but I try to be a man of integrity and honor , a faithful husband to my wife . That 's more important to me than what I do on the football field or how much money I make . " To that extent , he has created the Richard Seymour BGC ( Blessing God 's Children ) Foundation in an effort to instill a sense of hope in youth . The foundation has held several camps , and even a health fair , where doctors , dentists and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom had not seen a doctor in years . " We really set out to empower kids , " Seymour says of the foundation , which presently operates in Columbia , Boston and soon in Atlanta . " We try to give them hope . We target low-income kids ; the kids who ca n't help the situation that they are in . I believe I 'm able to give back and help . I want to do what I can to leave the world better than the way I found it . I want to be a successful Black man , on the field and off the field . " Seymour is a true believer in giving his time as well as financial support to those who are less fortunate . " Many of the kids need your time more than money , " he says . " I want to let the kids know that they do n't have to use sports to get out of their situation . Many of the kids are smart enough to get out of their situation by using their minds .
