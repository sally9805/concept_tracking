BEDTIME WITHOUT BOTTLES My one-year-old will not go to sleep without a bottle at bedtime and when he wakes crying two or three times a night , it 's the only thing that will get him back to sleep . What can I do ? * If anyone thinks parenting is easy , they should try weaning a baby - and parents - from a comforting bottle at bedtime . However , there are important health reasons for taking away that bottle by your baby 's first birthday . Drinking from a bottle promotes tooth decay , which can get in the way of good nutrition and even lead to serious oral infections . It can also prevent your son from getting the nutrition he needs from solid foods . The best approach is to go slow . Begin by offering only water in the bottle during the day ( small amounts of milk can be given in a sippy cup after meals , to a maximum of 20 to 24 ounces/590 to 700 mL a day ) . Gradually decrease the milk content of his night bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller quantities . At the same time , try to introduce a blanket or cuddly toy he can use to self-soothe . For the final step , pick a long weekend when you have the time and extra help you need . At bedtime , give him his milk , followed by water from a sippy cup ( brush his teeth afterward ! ) and put him down in his crib . I suggest you let him fuss for 15 minutes before you go into his room to soothe him . Since he 's been accustomed to middle-of-the-night bottles , you may need to offer him some water to help him settle . It will be difficult , but if you and all of his caretakers are consistent , his demand for nighttime milk will lessen over a few nights . Saying no for health reasons , and keeping to your word , is great practice for the next 20 years of parenting . - Diane Sacks , paediatrician PRESCHOOLER WO N'T LISTEN My four-year-old wo n't follow the most reasonable requests - things like going to the bathroom before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have tried explaining that her behaviour is not appropriate , but she just whines or throws a tantrum , and I end up resorting to bribery . * Bribery just does n't work over the long term because your daughter will only demand bigger and better bribes in exchange for her compliance . Instead , start by making sure she knows the rules . When she 's calm , tell her how you expect her to behave at the table , and that using the bathroom before you go out together is part of the routine . When she acts up , do n't try to engage her in a fruitless conversation , but offer her a choice . She can settle down at the table or leave . Keep in mind it could be that she is actually finished eating and just ca n't sit still any longer . Either way , allowing her to leave the table and play quietly or look at books is more sensible than forcing her to stay in her chair . Ignore her whining and yelling , and just move forward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time , she 'll settle down . - Kathy Lynn , parent educator GAG ORDER My five-year-old has always had a strong gag reflex . Trying foods with coarse textures , smelling odours she finds unpleasant , even blowing up a balloon will trigger it . She gets embarrassed when it happens in public . * The gag reflex is important because it ensures food does not get into our airways , and prevents us from choking . That said , it 's a good idea to have your daughter 's doctor perform a neurologic exam to ensure her reflex is completely normal . If gagging causes her to regurgitate food , the doctor should also check for reflux . If all is well from a physical standpoint , you can try an occupational therapy exercise to desensitize your daughter 's gag reflex : Move a soft toothbrush over your daughter 's tongue to see where her gag begins . Then touch the toothbrush to this spot over several days until the gag decreases . Be careful : You do n't want her to lose this tendency altogether because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our seven-year-old is always hugging her classmates , whether they reciprocate or not . This was fine back in kindergarten , but now that she 's older , we 're worried it will alienate some of her friends . We hug her and say " I love you " daily , so we 're at a loss to explain why she constantly seeks affection . * Hugging classmates is still quite common at your daughter 's age and even among older kids . If you are not yet seeing any signs of discomfort in her friends , trust that it 's still OK . On the other hand , if you are seeing signs that some kids do n't like it , you may want to gently point this out and help her develop new ways to show her affection . You can also teach her to ask for a hug first , as a way of respecting her friends ' personal space . Talk with your daughter about how affection is sometimes shown in different ways outside the family than it is at home . Teach her that a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ token of friendship , such as a handmade card or craft , are all wonderful ways of showing affection to friends . You might try modelling new affectionate behaviours toward your daughter : If your eyes light up and you have an excited tone of voice when you see her , and you comment about even the small things you like about her , she will learn to express affection in these new ways . But do keep hugging your daughter ! - Ruwa Sabbagh , psychotherapist TRYING CIGARETTES I found an opened pack of cigarettes in my 14-year-old ' s jacket . His father and I do n't smoke . How should we handle this ? * Just be factual and resist the urge to jump to conclusions . Comment simply that you found the cigarettes . Then listen to what your son has to say . The smoking may have been a one-time happening and not worthy of a big argument . It can be hard to stay cool , but it 's worthwhile for the message it sends to your son : You can talk to us about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't go crazy . Whatever his response , you can take the occasion to calmly remind him of the dangers of smoking and that you certainly do n't approve . WE WELCOME YOUR QUESTIONS about parenting problems .
