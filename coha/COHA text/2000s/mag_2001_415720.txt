Are they really seaworthy or just toys ? Photograph // What 's the smallest , lightest boat possible I o hnd out , we brought together nine very different boats that can be folded up into a carrying bag and stored in your closet , then quickly assembled for dockside fun . These are n't toys . Each can safely carry at least one adult and some can even handle Class IV whitewater . Klepper Alu-Lite Klepper has been making take-apart kayaks since 1907 . The new Alu-Lite model has a frame of color-coded , slip-together aluminum tubing . Once assembled , it zips easily into a rubberized fabric skin . Not only is the Klepper the most expensive bag boat we tried , we found it the most time-consuming and annoying to assemble . It also has the most individual pieces to lose or damage , and is the hardest for a novice to balance and paddle . Mistral WindGlider The WindGlider is a two-person windsurfer with an inflatable hull , two snap-in fin keels and a three-piece mast . It 's inexpensive and easy to assemble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rowed , paddled , pulled behind a motorboat or used as a swim float . It 's perfect for teaching windsurfing because instructor and pupil can sail together . Very cool . Outcast PAC 800 Measuring 8 ft. long and just over 4 ft. wide , this stubby inflatable catamaran is aimed at those who want to row into the middle of the stream , and then ride the current . Once the dozens of screws , bolts , pins , pipes and straps are in place , the PAC 800 proves easy to row , surprisingly maneuverable and fun . In this case , the whole is greater than the sum of its myriad , easily lost parts . Pakboat Puffin Sport The 19-pound Puffin 's frame consists of aluminum tubing threaded with shock cord to make st ringers , held in position by snap-in cross-ribs . You literally build the frame inside the high-tech fabric hull . Inflatable bladders run the length of the hull , smoothing out wrinkles , enhancing the hull shape and providing extra buoyancy . The result is a beautiful small canoe that weighs almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disassemble , carry and paddle . Just as impor  --  tant , the pieces are all big enough not to be over  --  looked when you 're packing up . Passion Cat-A-Pac If James Bond were standing at the edge of a stream with the bad guys right behind him , he 'd want a Cat-A-Pac . The Cat-A-Pac consists of three Kevlar boxes that nest together and weigh all of 20 pounds , total . A mitered slip joint holds the bow and stern to the midsection . It can literally go from backpack to canoe in 10 seconds . And not a bad canoe either , at least on smooth water . Just do n't take it in the surf . Porta-Bote Genesis III Thanks to polypropylene panels hinged at the chines , the Porta-Bote folds uo into a package that 's 4 in. thick , albeit over 12 ft. long and 20 in. wide . To assemble , just snap the setas in place to hold the folding hull open . The result looks like a conventional dinghy . It can be rowed , sailed and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is virtually indestructible and never needs painting . The Porta-Bote is a perfect replacement for a dinghy , easier to store and more durable , too . Outdoor Adventure Products Pow-R-Tube The Pow-R-Tube makes evervone laugh with delight . It consists of it cloth cover for a huge inner tube that incorporates a seat slung beneath the hole . A smaller inner tube supports a plastic box that holds a 12-volt battery and electric outboard motor . A controller straps to the larger tube . Photograph // The Pow-R-Tube can motor along at 3 or 4 mph . Steering is accomplished by kicking your feet . If you need more maneuverability , wear your swim fins . Honest . The Pow-R-Tube can go forward or in reverse . Intended as a. serious fishing tool , it 's a giggling hoot to motor around the marina at sunset , margarita in hand . Sea Eagle Explorer 380x Sea Eagle sells a va  --  riety of inflatable boats , from simple canoes to a 14-footer that takes a 40-hp outboard . The 380x canoe seats two , can handle Class IV whitewater and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists of two inflatable tubes made of 1000denier polyester connected by a separate inflatable floor , the Sea Eagle is easy to assemble , very compact and as comfortable as an air mattress . We first saw the B504 at the 2000 Outdoor Retailer Show , and thouht it was the cleverest boat we 'd ever seen . Nothing has come along to change that opinion . Intended for fishermen or duck hunters , this inflatable consists of PVC hull tubes covered with heavy-duty fabric . The bottom is a tough PVC tarpaulin . With nothing to assemble or take apart , it could n't be easier to inflate or deflate and repack . Less than 10 ft. long and 41 pounds , the 8504 has a roomy cockpit , a storage compartment , a deck with drink holders , molded carry handles and a rigid motor mount that can handle a 2-hp kicker or electric trolling motor . There 's even a spot for the battery . // BAG BOAT COMPARISON Photograph // <p>                 @ @ @ @
