Not a very nice man . <p> One afternoon not long after July became August , Deke Hollis told her she had company on the island . He called it the island , never the key . <p> Deke was a weathered fifty , or maybe seventy . He was tall and rangy and wore a battered old straw hat that looked like an inverted soup bowl . From seven in the morning until seven at night , he ran the drawbridge between Vermillion and the mainland . This was Monday to Friday . On weekends , " the kid " took over ( said kid being about thirty ) . Some days when Em ran up to the drawbridge and saw the kid instead of Deke in the old cane chair outside the gatehouse , reading Maxim or Popular Mechanics rather than The New York Times , she was startled to realize that Saturday had come around again . <p> This afternoon , though , it was Deke . The channel between Vermillion and the mainland  --  which Deke called the thrut ( throat , she assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A heron stood on the drawbridge 's Gulf-side rail , either meditating or looking for fish . <p> " Company ? " Em said . " I do n't have any company . " <p> " I did n't mean it that way . Pickering 's back . At 366 ? Brought one of his ' nieces . ' " The punctuation for nieces was provided by a roll of Deke 's eyes , of a blue so faded they were nearly colorless . <p> " I did n't see anyone , " Em said . <p> " No , " he agreed . " Crossed over in that big red M'cedes of his about an hour ago , while you were probably still lacin ' up your tennies . " He leaned forward over his newspaper ; it crackled against his flat belly . She saw he had the crossword about half completed . " Different niece every summer . Always young . " He paused . " Sometimes two nieces , one in August and one in September . " <p> " I do n't know him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any red Mercedes . " Nor did she know which house belonged to 366 . She noticed the houses themselves , but rarely paid attention to the mailboxes . Except , of course , for 219 . That was the one with the little line of carved birds on top of it . ( The house behind it was , of course , Birdland . ) <p> " Just as well , " Deke said . This time instead of rolling his eyes , he twitched down the corners of his mouth , as if he had something bad tasting in there . " He brings ' em down in the M'cedes , then takes ' em back to St. Petersburg in his boat . Big white yacht . The Playpen . Went through this morning . " The corners of his mouth did that thing again . In the far distance , thunder mumbled . " So the nieces get a tour of the house , then a nice little cruise up the coast , and we do n't see Pickering again until January , when it gets cold up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen a moored white pleasure craft on her morning beach run but was n't sure . <p> " Day or two from now  --  maybe a week  --  he 'll send out a couple of fellas , and one will drive the M'cedes back to wherever he keeps it stored away . Near the private airport in Naples , I imagine . " <p> " He must be very rich , " Em said . This was the longest conversation she 'd ever had with Deke , and it was interesting , but she started jogging in place just the same . Partly because she did n't want to stiffen up , mostly because her body was calling on her to run . <p> " Rich as Scrooge McDuck , but I got an idea Pickering actually spends his . Probably in ways Uncle Scrooge never imagined . Made it off some kind of computer thing , I heard . " The eye roll . " Do n't they all ? " <p> " I guess , " she said , still jogging in place . The thunder cleared its throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know you 're anxious to be off , but I 'm talking to you for a reason , " Deke said . He folded up his newspaper , put it beside the old cane chair , and stuck his coffee cup on top of it as a paperweight . " I do n't ordinarily talk out of school about folks on the island  --  a lot of ' em 's rich and I would n't last long if I did  --  but I like you , Emmy . You keep yourself to yourself , but you ai n't a bit snooty . Also , I like your father . Him and me 's lifted a beer , time to time . " <p> " Thanks , " she said . She was touched . And as a thought occurred to her , she smiled . " Did my dad ask you to keep an eye on me ? " <p> Deke shook his head . " Never did . Never would . Not R. J. 's style . He 'd tell you the same as I am , though  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd steer clear of him . If he invites you in for a drink or even just a cup of coffee with him and his new ' niece , ' I 'd say no . And if he were to ask you to go cruising with him , I would definitely say no . " <p> " I have no interest in cruising anywhere , " she said . What she was interested in was finishing her work on Vermillion Key . She felt it was almost done . " And I better get back before the rain starts . " <p> " Do n't think it 's coming until five , at least , " Deke said . " Although if I 'm wrong , I think you 'll still be okay . " <p> She smiled again . " Me too . Contrary to popular opinion , women do n't melt in the rain . I 'll tell my dad you said hello . " <p> " You do that . " He bent down to get his paper , then paused , looking at her from beneath that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " Better , " she said . " Better every day . " She turned and began her road run back to the Little Grass Shack . She raised her hand as she went , and as she did , the heron that had been perched on the drawbridge rail flapped past her with a fish in its long bill . <br> <p> Three sixty-six turned out to be the Pillbox , and for the first time since she 'd come to Vermillion , the gate was standing ajar . Or had it been ajar when she ran past it toward the bridge ? She could n't remember  --  but of course she had taken up wearing a watch , a clunky thing with a big digital readout , so she could time herself . She had probably been looking at that when she went by . <p> She almost passed without slowing  --  the thunder was closer now  --  but she was n't exactly wearing a thousand-dollar suede skirt from Jill Anderson , only an ensemble from the Athletic Attic : shorts and a T-shirt with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Deke ? Women do n't melt in the rain . So she slowed , swerved , and had a peek . It was simple curiosity . <p> She thought the Mercedes parked in the courtyard was a 450 SL , because her father had one like it , although his was pretty old now and this one looked brand-new . It was candy-apple red , its body brilliant even under the darkening sky . The trunk was open . A sheaf of long blond hair hung from it . There was blood in the hair . <p> Had Deke said the girl with Pickering was a blond ? That was her first question , and she was so shocked , so fucking amazed , that there was no surprise in it . It seemed like a perfectly reasonable question , and the answer was Deke had n't said . Only that she was young . And a niece . With the eye roll . <p> Thunder rumbled . Almost directly overhead now . The courtyard was empty except for the car ( and the blond in the trunk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too : buttoned up and more like a pillbox than ever . Even the palms swaying around it could n't soften it . It was too big , too stark , too gray . It was an ugly house . <p> Em thought she heard a moan . She ran through the gate and across the yard to the open trunk without even thinking about it . She looked in . The girl in the trunk had n't moaned . Her eyes were open , but she had been stabbed in what looked like dozens of places , and her throat was cut ear to ear . <p> Em stood looking in , too shocked to move , too shocked to even breathe . Then it occurred to her that this was a fake dead girl , a movie prop . Even as her rational mind was telling her that was bullshit , the part of her that specialized in rationalization was nodding frantically . Even making up a story to backstop the idea . Deke did n't like Pickering , and Pickering 's choice of female companionship ? Well guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was nothing but an elaborate practical joke . Pickering would go back across the bridge with the trunk deliberately ajar , that fake blond hair fluttering , and  --  <p> But there were smells rising out of the trunk now . They were the smells of shit and blood . Em reached forward and touched the cheek below one of those staring eyes . It was cold , but it was skin . Oh God , it was human skin . <p> There was a sound behind her . A footstep . She started to turn , and something came down on her head . There was no pain , but brilliant white seemed to leap across the world . Then the world went dark.Copyright 2008 by Stephen King <br> Continues ...
