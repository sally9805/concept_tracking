Philanthropist JESSICA SEINFELD shares her blessings and helps other New York moms find a way to do the same . By Stacey Okun // When her daughter , Sascha , was born six years ago , Jessica Seinfeld became , in her own words , a " typical type-A " first-time mother : overwhelmed , exhausted and suddenly inundated by stuff . " The baby gifts kept coming and coming , " she says . " All I could think about was that there were so many people in New York City who did n't have anything for their babies . " Then one day , as she and her husband , comedian Jerry Seinfeld , were driving along Manhattan 's West Side Highway , the proverbial lightbulb switched on . " It was such a simple idea , " she says . " I would find a way to get things from the mothers who do n't need them to the mothers who do . " In early 2001 Seinfeld , then thirty , and several of her best girlfriends began filling shopping bags with their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribute them . The concept , which Seinfeld developed into a nonprofit organization called Baby Buggy , worked remarkably well , and the budding philanthropist realized that with more resources , she could greatly expand the program . So she thought about all the people she knew and asked those who would be disposed to help for their support . Putting her famous surname to good use , she cut right through the red tape and reached prominent individuals who , in turn , connected her to the right people at New York 's social-service agencies . Shortly after Baby Buggy began , it was given a big task : providing emergency aid for thousands of mothers affected by the terrorist attacks on September 11 , 2001 . Seinfeld rented a space in a hip indoor marketplace in Chelsea and reached out to others to spread the word . " We did n't even have a telephone yet , " Seinfeld recalls . After the drive had concluded and the Chelsea operation had closed down , mothers continued to bring donations . " People were dropping off hags in the lobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was time for more space , and in January 2002 , Newmark Realty donated a year 's rent on a 5,000-square-foot loft that became Baby Buggy 's headquarters and storage area for its fast-growing inventory . The extra room came just in time . Since its inception , the charity has collected more than a million essential items ( diapers , cribs , gently used clothing for children aged 0-4 , strollers , baby carriers and high chairs ) and distributed them to thousands of families in need throughout the New York City metro area . All cribs and bassinets are presented to mothers in need who give birth in Bushwick , Brooklyn , or in Harlem . Volunteers of all ages have donated their time , helping to collect , sort and route the goods to a network of nearly eighty social-service partners , groups such as Safe Horizon and the Family Preservation Program . " It 's a wonder no one thought of this before , " says Baby Buggy board member Tina Sharkey . " But Jessica has a heart the size of Manhattan . " From Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with certain city charities and their caseworkers . " When mothers are in crisis , caseworkers have to get them to fill out forms , urge them to see doctors or drug counselors and give them advice they do n't always like hearing , " says Seinfeld . Claudia Fleming , Baby Buggy 's dynamic executive director , whom Seinfeld hired in 2002 , adds : " Our goods enable these caseworkers to come to their meetings with the supplies mothers need to care for their children . " What in the past had been an adversarial relationship between the frustrated caseworkers and their needy clients has instead become a partnership that can really effect change . Effect change is exactly what Fleming did when she came on board-at a real make-or-break time for the charity . " When Jessica hired me , we were three months away from having to pay rent on this space , " she says , seated at a wellworn volunteer table that is piled high with impeccably organized donations . Given that Baby Buggy focuses on " prevention and rehabilitation , " one of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is Seinfeld 's hope , for example , that giving mothers cribs will help prevent the infant suffocation that sometimes occurs when babies sleep in the same bed as their parents . But for now , it 's the small victories that keep her going-and going . " Did you hear about the boy who wore girls ' shoes his whole life until we gave him his own pair of sneakers ? " she asks . As is the case with most nonprofit organizations . Baby Buggy needs a constant flow of cash-roughly $1 million annually-to survive . Much of that money is raised at a biannual charity event headlined by one of the greatest entertainers of our time . Planning for the gala begins when " I sheepishly ask my husband-a year in advance-to perform , " Seinfeld says . Not that it 's such a tough sell . " Anything about children moves him . " If he did n't do the benefit , I 'd have to work eighty hours a week to fundraise , " she continues . Truth be told , she works the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clearly , there is more to Seinfeld than you see in paparazzi photos and " Page Six " tidbits about her and Jerry on the town : she thrives on throwing herself into field work , from visiting the fami lies assisted by Baby Buggy to speaking in her daughter 's classroom , where she recently held a mini drive . " My kids love the idea of Baby Buggy , " she says , " and while they 're not allowed to watch TV during the week , they can watch the Baby Buggy fundraising video . It 's one of their favorites . " Having had three babies of her own in five years ( Sascha is five ; Julian , three ; and Shepherd , ten months ) , Seinfeld feels highly attuned to the needs of children . And she relishes collecting anecdotes about the kids who have touched her life . A favorite story relayed to her by one of her board members concerns a little girl . exactly Sascha 's age , who was given a skirt to wear by a caseworker . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She was crying , her mother was crying , they were all crying . " Later that evening , it dawned on Seinfeld that if this girl was like her own daughter , she 'd be so excited that she 'd want to wear the skirt right away . The weather was cold , though , and she would need tights to cover her legs . " I just had to get her those tights , " says Seinfeld . Fortunately , they were in Baby Buggy 's inventory-and a few hours later . the child had her tights . Stories like these are often shared during meetings of Friends of Baby Buggy , Seinfeld 's latest brainchild . A satellite group of young women she herself selected , it meets with representatives of the city 's social-service agencies to gain a deeper awareness and knowledge of such topics as homelessness , domestic violence and women in the city who are in need . " I 've learned that we must connect to our donors , " Seinfeld says , " by bringing their donations to life . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their own kids to help Baby Buggy , Seinfeld vows that she is " personally going to make the experience worth their while . " Although representatives from many other cities have expressed interest in franchising Baby Buggy , both Seinfeld and Fleming believe that , for now , they should concentrate on stopping the cycle of poverty in New York . " We have a beautiful model , and people are welcome to study it , " Fleming says , " but if we get too big , we 'll lose our focus . We never want to give up collecting those two bags from Mrs. Smith on Park Avenue " - and getting them to Mrs. Smith in Harlem . Sidebar Jessica Seinfeld , at home with her infant son , Shepherd , rejoices in her role as a mother . Sidebar Seinfeld quickly becomes animated when discussing Baby Buggy , a charity idea that has succeeded beyond her wildest imagination .

When one of her friends has a baby , Tina Sharkey , a Baby Buggy board member , donates a bassinet and a crib in the child 's honor . A beautiful card goes to the pampered baby 's family , but the essential items are delivered to a needier mother and child . Another woman turned a special-occasion party into a boon for Baby Buggy , deciding at the last minute to cancel the fancy festivities and have her guests do a good deed instead . Recalls Sharkey , a senior vice president at AOL , the guests congregated at the Baby Buggy offices with items to donate in hand .

" Jessica seems driven to give back because she has been so fortunate herself . And she 's as real as they come .
