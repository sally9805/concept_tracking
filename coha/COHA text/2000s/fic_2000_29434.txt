BROTHERHOOD The city filled its vast central basin like a reservoir fills its impoundment , chains of linked town houses lapping at a litter-encrusted shoreline of brown , scabby hills . The hills had been set aside as park a hundred years ago and had slowly strangled into wasteland : neglected , junk-filled , eroded , dangerous . Eruptive urban growth had long since spilled past them and flooded the valleys beyond to bury farmland , swallow rural communities , and engulf remnant woods . This overflow of the urban grid had no final boundary : its horizons were lost in haze , its edges smeared by cancerous growth . The sky was stagnant white , the city gray , and the occasional splashes of architectural color only emphasized the monotony they were painted on . In this dense human colony land was like gold , space currency , and square footage the source of rivalry and aspiration . Houses were bonded like Siamese twins , or stacked like the comb of a hive . Each looked like its neighbor : cramped , clay-colored , straining for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greenery enclosed in pots . On the worst days , when the light was flat and the wafer of sun melted at its edges like a seltzer tablet , the city was a hard , ugly place . Yet the beast retained the seductive throb of human life . At night its arterials were ribbons of light and its tiled plain of asphalt and plastic roofs was broken by archipelagos of soaring skyscrapers and corporate pyramids . Malls were emporiums of bright commerce and cafs spilled onto sidewalks . Winking hovercraft darted like fireflies and info-lasers stabbedskyward toward satellites . Corporate names crested buildings like proud coxcombs , crowing with a glow of marketed pride . The beacons intended warmth , like the remembered reassurance of the lamp or tavern sign , butbloated to football field dimensionsthey instead drenched their neighborhoods with commercial glare . The sign war extended to the sky , where searchlights cast logos on nighttime haze , lasers flickered to announce openings or bankruptcies , and blimps drifted with holographic tidings . The city 's signs were a galaxy of rival artificial suns and the pictures they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and romanticized world : glistening beaches , convivial families , green meadows , detached houses . " In the world of United Corporations , " read one , " everyone can win , all the time . " In Quadrant 43 , between the St. Francis and Reagan Expressways , a twenty-first-century pyramid rose from its walled enclosure of plasti-marble plazas , boxed gardens , and black reflecting pools : a glass and metal pointed office building one hundred stories high . Its colored panels and opaque windows shimmered as they chemically changed mood with the time of day : the smoky blue of morning giving way to noon 's perky silver , mellowing to a burnished copper as the day waned , and finally darkening to a swallowing black . The windows looked out , but no one could see in . Utility tubes popped from the ground and fed the pyramid 's base like placental cords . Inside , Microcore 's headquarters had its own shops , its own restaurants , its own banks , its own hydrogen pumps , and its own kiosks . It was a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the pyramid 's summit like an insect queen . Level and location on each of the one hundred floors below were allocated on the basis of rank . At each floor , supervisors occupied offices on the outer rim in a cordon . Within was a maze of cubicles that penned their subordinates , the partitions low enough to ensure that heads could be observed bowed in work . This laboring center was a ghostly group . Even dark complexions looked pale from the flush of light that crept out from the edges of the opti-glasses that had replaced computer screens . The workers typed , murmured commands , clicked . The results created flickers of light that played across their temples like an echo of thought . There was little noise above the hum of Muzak , the beep of terminal signals , and the drone of ventilation . It was unseemly to yell , startling to laugh , and easier to communicate electronically . People had become extensions of the wires they were hooked to . The chairman rode up and down the inner face of the pyramid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angled track . The privacy enabled her to see the employees of each floor without being seen , the box whispering like a gray ghost . Everyone wondered , of course , what the chairman did when she rode up and down past her thousands of minions . Did she calculate profits , note empty cubicles , play a head-vid , point out a suggested promotionNo one knew . Few below the upper floors had ever seen her . Everyone strove for graduation to those upper floors . At each level , an electronic ribbon of scenic vistas and encouraging slogans circled the central cubicles , giving a border of color . " Microcore , " read one . " Where win-win is a way of life . " On Level 31 , Cubicle 17 , Daniel Dyson ignored the encouragement of the videograms and set his opti-glasses aside . He was preoccupied with a more personal goal : the quest for female attention . Specifically , Daniel had calculated that the walls of what he called the rodent corralbeige cubicle dividers , to match the beige carpet and beige desks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high enough to allow him to secretly prepare , and yet low enough to launch , his latest experiment in physics and flirtation . Mona Pietri , Cubicle 46 , was the latest woman of his dreams : dark-haired , doe-eyed , and curvaceous as a sine wave . Daniel suspected genetic and surgical supplementation had enhanced what nature had initially bestowed but was willing to embrace this commitment to self-improvement as a sign of inner beauty . God , she was stacked ! She , in turn , was utterly oblivious to his existence . Which made her , of course , all the more desirable . Unable to concoct a corporate excuse to work with her , Daniel had decided to send an invitation to share the latest beverage craze ( a Mongolian fermented mare 's milk cappuccino , the latest morale booster of the corporate cafeteria ) the old-fashioned way : launching it by catapult . Fate and physics would determine the arc of romance . Daniel had constructed the miniature war machine out of office supplies that had outlasted every promise of office automation in a.d. 2048 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drill and fasten , rubber bands for bracing and to provide torque for the catapult 's lever arm . He attached the helmet of a Star-Trooper action doll to the arm with a combination of chewing gum and Bond-It adhesive . Within the helmet nestled his missile : a raspberry chocolate wrapped in a ribbon of paper . On the paper he had printed : Mona I 'm gon na Getta Mongo Will you gongo With me Cubicle 17 ( Daniel ) Poetry was not one of the skills listed on his corporate performance appraisal . Still , he calculated its attempt was potentially more rewardingor at least more interestingthan working on the software Meeting Minder , which was what he was supposed to be doing . A military history major in college ( " And what are you going to do with that in a world of no armies ? " his father had protested in futility ) , Daniel had an academic 's understanding of how a catapult was supposed to work . Calculating its trajectory was a matter of trial and error , however , and Daniel figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amour before supervisors put an end to his experiment . He 'd done a few test firings across the width of his desk . Now he wound the torsion rubber band tighter to achieve the calculated distance and sighted toward Ms. Pietri 's pretty head , as remote and alabaster as the moon . " One small step toward sexual chemistry , " he whispered , hoping she liked chocolate . " Fire ! " A few neighboring heads snapped up . No one thought for a moment that a cubicle was in flames . It was just Dyson , who had a reputation for keeping things interesting . The chocolate shot ceiling-ward , the ribbon of its message unexpectedly unreeling . That tail was enough to spoil his calculations . The projectile went awry and dropped like a meteor into the lair of Harriet Lundeen , the Level 31 floor manager . Its whap was a note of doom . The poem bore his return address . " Uh-oh . " " If you 're declaring war , Dyson , you 'll lose , " his colleague Sanford predicted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been beaten . " Meanwhile , desirable Mona had n't even looked up . Daniel waited a full minute for a reaction , time enough to hope his missile had fallen undetected or that Ms. Lundeen had elected to ignore his misfire for the price of a chocolate . Maybe she was hoping she could meet him for a Mongo , the old bat . He covered his catapult with waste paper in the desk basket . But no , here she came with the countenance and body of a Wagnerian Valkyrie , lacking only breastplate and horned helmet . The ribbon poem was held out like a piece of decaying meat . " Is this yours , Mr. Dyson " " You looked hungry , " he tried . " My name is not Mona . " " That 's true . Actually , I was routing that to Ms. Pietri . " " I see . " She sighted toward the goddess of Cubicle 46 . " And " gongo ? " What does that mean ? Is it lewd , or are you merely witless ? " Dyson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm trying to be creative , Ms. Lundeen . It 's asking if she 'll go with me . I think it makes sense , in the context of the poem . Like Jabberwocky . " Sanford snickered . " Jabber what " " It 's another poem . " Lundeen considered whether he was putting her on . " Your literary taste is as bad as your aim , " she finally decided . Then she glanced sourly around his cubicle . " And your discipline . " Every other employee on Level 31 had adhered to the request to maintain an " orderly and respectful desktop decor " in line with corporate atmospheric guidelines . Dyson 's , however , was a pocket of cluttered individuality : pictures of climbers on Everest and camels in the Sahara , bearded revolutionaries of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , two tattered pinups discreetly draped with Microcore calendars , a meditatively chewed plastic stegosaurus , several holo-movie figurines , parts from a magic kit , food wrappers , stained cups , and a Cuddle Doll with a noose around its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her stare was not amused . " Cultivate conformity , Mr. Dyson. "
