Just the sight of her back reveals a pitch perfect petulance . She tells him : <p> # LISA # A man 's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes . Only the amount matters . <p> # SAMUEL # And bankruptcy .

They do n't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt . <p> # LISA # Samuel , it is not something we should skimp on .

The organization that he began now protects criminals at the highest level where I would need a Presidential finding in order to expose it ... or you . <p> The WAITER steps over ; Manzano waves him off . <p> # MANZANO # My family lives in Miami . Because of the death threats . <p> # CREASY # It 's not worth it . Be with them instead . <p> # MANZANO # It galls me to watch you . You can do as much in days as I can in years . Men like the ' The Dreamer ' are protected . Out of everyone 's grasp it seems , but yours . <p> # CREASY # Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death ? <p> Manzano laughs again . Genuine . Creasy cracks him up . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence . They need to be brought to trial . Dealt with properly . Then people will respect the law . When they see it works . <p> # CREASY # So you are going to talk me to death . <p> # MANZANO # You walk out and deal justice . You 're what I wish I could be . ( another laugh , then a beat ) The policemen who kills you , his family will have all they want . <p> # CREASY # Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids . What do you want ? <p> # MANZANO # I want to arrest you for murder ! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun ! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing . <p> # CREASY # My deal is with Rosanna . I knew you guys were up to something .

He pulls out a folded PIECE OF PAPER and a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE . He hands the bottle out first . <p> # MANZANO # Percodan . I imagine you need handfuls by now . <p> Creasy makes no move to take it . Manzano sighs , sets it down in front of him . Regarding the paper ... <p> # MANZANO # Account belongs to a woman we think is The Dreamer 's girlfriend . Reina Rosas , who is 8 months pregnant . <p> Creasy holds his hand out . Manzano hesitates . <p> # MANZANO # The plan is the girlfriend will lead you to the Boss . You 'll lead me , and I 'll arrest him . Agreed ? <p> Creasy does n't respond . Finally Manzano gives him the paper , a mimeographed mugshot , and address scrawled on it .

A SMALL FIGURE in a hooded sweat shirt and sweat pants exits the car . Confused . Disoriented . <p> CREST OF THE BRIDGE <p> Creasy waits . Breathing labored breaths . He sees it all . <p> OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE <p> The driver unties little hands . Removes a blindfold from under the hood . He steps away . Offering no help . <p> The small figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls out : <p> # CREASY # Pinta . Pinta . <p> She turns and looks . It looks remarkably like her even under the hooded sweatshirt . She begins to run . Across the street , up the steps toward Creasy . A screaming train flashes beneath . Car headlights illuminate the bridge . <p> Time stands still and the ' city sounds ' fade out to nothing . <p> She runs up the remaining stairs and sprints across the bridge . Her hood blows off revealing her full face . It 's definitely Pinta . Camera ramps as he jumps into Creasy 's arms . This is not the little girl we experienced in the beginning of the movie . The experience she just endured has been life changing . All of a sudden we have a 40 year old head on an 8 year old body . <p> She wraps herself around him . He picks her up . We glimpse a simple tear on his cheek . They talk . But we do not hear the words . <p> She notices her mom on the far side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Before she goes to her mother we hear : <p> # PINTA # I love you , Creasy ... And you love me , right ? <p> Creasy nods . The inference is that he will see her in a few minutes . <p> We start to hear Linda Ronstadt painfully , quietly on the wind singing " Blue Bayou . " He continues to walk across to the opposite side of the bridge and gets into the kidnappers ' car . <p> There 's a certain sort of calm of him . He closes the door , he lays his head against the back window . He looks out at PINTA at the other side of the bridge , where she 's screams for Creasy . " Blue Bayou " gets LOUDER . Pinta now knows it was a lie . Creasy is not coming back . We 're shooting through the glass of the back window . We se Mexico City reflected in the glass . As the car pulls out , time slows , and we see Creasy lay his head back and close his eyes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pinta can see Creasy 's face , eyes slowly closing . He can hear her screams before being enveloped by the night . As " Blue Bayou " continues ... <p> EXT . MEXICO CITY STREETS - DAY <p> Dark spot in the road . Suddenly Police lights , on the roofs of four cars , flash simultaneously in front , in blocking position . The driver turns and looks back wanting to escape . He has a blacked out AFI armored van right on his rear bumper . Nowhere to go . <p> SWAT at his door . He 's pulled and proned out onto the road . <p> Manzano enters the driver 's seat . Reaching back to Creasy . Grabs his hand . <p> # MANZANO # I 'm your chauffeur now , Creasy . <p> Manzano does a U-turn . Heading away . On his portable radio . <p> # MANZANO # All units .

Manzano pulls to the curb . <p> Manzano reaches Creasy 's wrist . Takes his pulse . Creasy 's gone . <p> Beat . <p> Manzano kneels . Still holding Creasy . Unfolds Creasy 's fingers . <p> CLOSE UP - Pinta 's medallion of St. Jude clutched in his hand . <p> Manzano punches the seat again again and again . <p> # MANZANO # Goddamn you . <p> EXT .

" <p> The car stops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear door : His forehead explodes . The driver door opens barely two shots , two more bodies drop . <p> Panic and confusion . Everybody runs for cover . An overhead helicopter illuminates the mayhem in the courtyard . An armored vehicle rams through the gates . <p> Manzano explodes out of the driver 's door in slow motion . He is clearly on a mission . He strides through the mayhem , Creasy 's Sig Sauer in one hand , and a .45 auto in the other . <p> Manzano 's guide to his destination is the ' The Dreamer 's ' little Jack Russell running back to his master on instinct . <p> Manzano moves purposefully . His surrounding environment is Chaplinesque in its chaos . He enters a long walkway to a patio , following the dog . Daniel Sanchez appears at the end of the hall . We ramp him into slow motion . The Mexican version of Gotti . He raises his arms , prepared for the inevitable . The outcome is a given . <p> Manzano unloads a magazine into him and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " HOMBRE EN FUEGO " <p> BLACKNESS . <p> CREASY 'S VOICE Ezekiel 25:17 .
