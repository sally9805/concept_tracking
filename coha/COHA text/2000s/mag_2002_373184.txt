Only a generation ago , a woman who wanted a career in aviation could expect to climb only as high as purser , or head flight attendant on a passenger jet . But last year a woman was named president of the world 's most successful airline . Every major U.S. airline has at least one woman in a top executive position . Six of the nation 's nine largest carriers have a woman as general counsel  --  the highest concentration in any major U.S. industry . Women have even taken over such traditionally male posts as chief financial officer and chief of pilots . And their colleagues , male and female , say these women are changing the way the airlines do business . <P> Airline CEOs say that while many of their male managers have emphasized hardware and thought of their job as moving planes efficiently from place to place , women executives seem to understand more clearly that they are in a service business  --  and that happy workers make for happy customers . Roughly half of airline employees are women , as are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few women business travelers 20 years ago , and consequently the airlines did n't cater to them , " says George Hamlin , an aviation consultant based in Washington . " Now women are not only an important part of the customer base , but the women who joined the airlines two decades ago have moved into management positions , where they can adapt airline policies to attract female customers . " <P> Here 's a look at six of the most influential women in the airline business today : <P> SHELLEY LONGMUIR SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT , UNITED AIRLINES ( cover ) <P> Longmuir serves as her airline 's top executive for governmental , regulatory and international affairs and compares the job to " playing 3-D global chess . " A former corporate lawyer in New York City , she worked closely with then Transportation Secretary Andy Card , currently the White House chief of staff , and in 1992 helped coordinate federal disaster-relief efforts after Hurricane Andrew . She then went to work for United Airlines , now the world 's second largest carrier , after American Airlines , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  since 1993 . <P> Longmuir , 46 , credits Card and some of her other male bosses with " being so gender blind that they had more confidence in my abilities than I did . " She believes women " are more comfortable working in teams , and that is an advantage in such a complex business " as aviation . She helped United make the transition to an employee-owned corporation , oversaw its successful international expansion and coordinated the Washington angle of the bold yet ultimately unsuccessful merger attempt with US Airways . <P> As the fortunes of U.S. airlines become more dependent on government regulations and largesse , Longmuir 's experience in Washington is raising her profile . A smooth talker who double-majored in semiotics and Shakespearean literature at Brown University , Longmuir will need all her skills to deliver on the $1.8 billion loan application United has submitted to the government 's airline stabilization board . <P> ANDREA SCHNEIDER VICE PRESIDENT , ALASKA AIRLINES
