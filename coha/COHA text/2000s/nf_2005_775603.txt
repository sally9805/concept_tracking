Introduction The Sleeper Curve // Every childhood has its talismans , the sacred objects that look innocuous enough to the outside world , but that trigger an onslaught of vivid memories when the grown child confronts them . For me , it 's a sheaf of xeroxed numbers that my father brought home from his law firm when I was nine . These pages did n't seem , at first glance , like the sort of thing that would send a grade-schooler into rapture . From a distance you might have guessed that they were payroll reports , until you got close enough to notice that the names were familiar ones , even famous : Catfish Hunter , Pete Rose , Vida Blue . Baseball names , stranded in a sea of random numbers . // Those pages my dad brought home were part of a game , though it was a game unlike any I had ever played . It was a baseball simulation called APBA , short for American Professional Baseball Association . APBA was a game of dice and data . A company in Lancaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and created a collection of cards , one for each player who had played more than a dozen games that year . The cards contained a cryptic grid of digits that captured numerically each player 's aptitudes on the baseball diamond : the sluggers and the strikeout prone , the control artists and the speed demons . In the simplest sense , APBA was a way of playing baseball with cards , or at least pretending to be a baseball manager : you 'd pick out a lineup , decide on your starting pitchers , choose when to bunt and when to steal . // APBA sounds entertaining enough at that level of generality-what kid would n't want to manage a sports team ? - but actually playing the game was a more complicated affair . On the simplest level , the game followed this basic sequence : you picked your players , decided on a strategy , rolled a few dice , and then consulted a " lookup chart " to figure out what happened-a strikeout , or a home run , a grounder to third . // But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a human opponent , or manage both teams yourself , and the decisions made for the opposing team transformed the variables in subtle but crucial ways . At the beginning of each game-and anytime you made a substitution-you had to add up all the fielding ratings for each player in your lineup . Certain performance results would change if your team was unusually adept with the glove , while teams that were less talented defensively would generate more errors . There were completely different charts depending on the number of runners on base : if you had a man on third , you consulted the " Runner on Third " chart . Certain performance numbers came with different results , depending on the quality of the pitcher : if you were facing a " grade A " pitcher , according to the data on his card , you 'd get a strikeout , while a " grade C " pitcher would generate a single to right field . And that was just scratching the surface of the game 's complexity . Here 's the full entry for " Pitching " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hitting numbers under which lines appear may be altered according to the grade of the pitcher against whom the team is batting . Always observe the grade of the pitcher and look for possible changes of those numbers which are underlined . " No Change " always refers back to the D , or left , column and always means a base hit . Against Grade D pitchers there is never any change-the left hand column only is used . When a pitcher is withdrawn from the game make a note of the grade of the pitcher who relieves him . If his grade is different , a different column must be referred to when the underlined numbers come up . Certain players may have the numbers 7 , 8 , and/or 11 in the second columns of their cards . When any of these numbers is found in the second column of a player card , it is not subject to normal grade changes . Always use the left ( Grade D ) column in these cases , no matter what the pitcher 's grade is . Occasionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratings . Always consider these pitchers as Grade A pitchers unless the A column happens to be a base hit . Then use the C or B column , as the case may be , for the final play result . // Got that ? They might as well be the tax form instructions you 'd happily pay an accountant to decipher . Reading these words now , I have to slow myself down just to follow the syntax , but my ten-year-old self had so thoroughly internalized this arcana that I played hundreds of APBA games without having to consult the fine print . An 11 in the second column on the batter 's card ? Obviously , obviously that means ignore the normal grade changes for the pitcher . It 'd be crazy not to ! // The creators of APBA devised such an elaborate system for understandable reasons : they were pushing the limits of the dice-and-cards genre to accommodate the statistical complexity of baseball . This mathematical intricacy was not limited to baseball simulations , of course . Comparable games existed for most popular sports : basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a last-minute three-point Hail Mary before the clock ran out ; boxing games that let you replay Ali/Foreman without the rope-a-dope strategy . British football fans played games like Soccerboss and Wembley that let you manage entire franchises , trading players and maintaining the financial health of the virtual organization . A host of dice-based military simulations re-created historical battles or entire world wars with painstaking fidelity . // Perhaps most famously , players of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and its many imitators built elaborate fantasy narratives-all by rolling twenty-sided dice and consulting bewildering charts that accounted for a staggering number of variables . The three primary manuals for playing the game were more than five hundred pages long , with hundreds of lookup charts that players consulted as though they were reading from scripture . ( By comparison , consulting the APBA charts was like reading the back of a cereal box . ) Here 's the Player 's Handbook describing the process by which a sample character is created : // Monte wants to create a new character . He rolls four six-sided dice ( 4d6 ) and gets 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowest die , he records the result on scratch paper , 13 . He does this five more times and gets these six scores : 13 , 10 , 15 , 12 , 8 , and 14 . Monte decides to play a strong , tough Dwarven fighter . Now he assigns his rolls to abilities . Strength gets the highest score , 15 . His character has a +2 Strength bonus that will serve him well in combat . Constitution gets the next highest score , 14 . The Dwarf 's +2 Constitution racial ability adjustment see Table 2-1 : Racial Ability Adjustments , pg . 12 improves his Constitution score to 16 , for a +3 bonus .... Monte has two bonus-range scores left ( 13 and 12 ) plus an average score ( 10 ) . Dexterity gets the 13 ( +1 bonus ) . // And that 's merely defining the basic faculties for a character . Once you released your Dwarven fighter into the world , the calculations involved in determining the effects of his actions-attacking a specific creature with a specific weapon under specific circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most kids weeping if you put the same charts on a math quiz . // Which gets to the ultimate question of why a ten-year-old found any of this fun . For me , the embarrassing truth of the matter is that I did ultimately grow frustrated with my baseball simulation , but not for the reasons you might expect . It was n't that arcane language wore me down , or that I grew tired of switching columns on the Bases Empty chart , or that I decided that six hours was too long to spend alone in my room on a Saturday afternoon in July . // No , I moved on from APBA because it was n't realistic enough . // My list of complaints grew as my experience with APBA deepened . Playing hundreds of simulated games revealed the blind spots and strange skews of the simulation . APBA neglected the importance of whether your players were left-handed or right-handed , crucial to the strategy of baseball . The fielding talents of individual players were largely ignored . The vital decision to throw different kinds of pitches-sliders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no notice of where the games were being played : you could n't simulate the vulnerable left-field fence in Fenway Park , so tempting to right-handed hitters , or the swirling winds of San Francisco 's old Candlestick Park . And while APBA included historic teams , there was no way to factor in historical changes in the game when playing teams from different eras against each other . // And so over the next three years , I embarked on a long journey through the surprisingly populated world of dice-baseball simulations , ordering them from ads printed in the back of the Sporting News and Street and Smith 's annual baseball guide . I dabbled with Strat-o-Matic , the most popular of the baseball sims ; I sampled Statis Pro Baseball from Avalon Hill , maker of the then-popular Diplomacy board game ; I toyed with one title called Time Travel baseball that specialized in drafting fantasy teams from a pool of historic players . I lost several months to a game called Extra Innings that bypassed cards and boards altogether ; it did n't even come packaged in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data . You rolled six separate dice to complete a play , sometimes consulting five or six separate pages to determine what had happened . // Eventually , like some kind of crazed addict searching for an ever-purer high , I found myself designing my own simulations , building entire games from scratch . I borrowed a twenty-sided die from my Dungeons &amp; Dragons set-the math was far easier to do with twenty sides than it was with six . I scrawled out my play charts on yellow legal pads , and translated the last season 's statistics into my own home-brewed player cards . For some people , I suppose , thinking of youthful baseball games conjures up the smell of leather gloves and fresh-cut grass . For me , what comes to mind is the statistical purity of the twenty-sided die . // This story , I freely admit , used to have a self-congratulatory moral to it . As a grownup , I would tell new friends about my fifth-grade days building elaborate simulations in my room , and on the surface I 'd make a joke about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my twenty-sided dice while the other kids roamed outside playing capture the flag or , God forbid , real baseball . But the latent message of my story was clear : I was some kind of statistical prodigy , building simulated worlds out of legal pads and probability charts . // But I no longer think that my experience was all that unusual . I suspect millions of people from my generation probably have comparable stories to tell : if not of sports simulations then of Dungeons &amp; Dragons , or the geopolitical strategy of games like Diplomacy , a kind of chess superimposed onto actual history . More important , in the quarter century that has passed since I first began exploring those xeroxed APBA pages , what once felt like a maverick obsession has become a thoroughly mainstream pursuit . // This book is , ultimately , the story of how the kind of thinking that I was doing on my bedroom floor became an everyday component of mass entertainment . It 's the story of how systems analysis , probability theory , pattern recognition , and-amazingly enough-old-fashioned patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern pop culture . Because the truth is my solitary obsession with modeling complex simulations is now ordinary behavior for most consumers of digital age entertainment . This kind of education is not happening in classrooms or museums ; it 's happening in living rooms and basements , on PCs and television screens . This is the Sleeper Curve : The most debased forms of mass diversion-video games and violent television dramas and juvenile sitcoms-turn out to be nutritional after all . For decades , we 've worked under the assumption that mass culture follows a steadily declining path toward **25;698;TOOLONG standards , presumably because the " masses " want dumb , simple pleasures and big media companies want to give the masses what they want . But in fact , the exact opposite is happening : the culture is getting more intellectually demanding , not less . // Most of the time , criticism that takes pop culture seriously involves performing some kind of symbolic analysis , decoding the work to demonstrate the way it represents some other aspect of society . You can see this symbolic approach at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop forms expressed the struggle of various disenfranchised groups : gays and lesbians , people of color , women , the third world . You can see it at work in the " zeitgeist " criticism featured in media sections of newspapers and newsweeklies , where the critic establishes a symbolic relationship between the work and some spirit of the age : yuppie self-indulgence , say , or post-9/11 anxiety . // The approach followed in this book is more systemic than symbolic , more about causal relationships than metaphors . It is closer , in a sense , to physics than to poetry . My argument for the existence of the Sleeper Curve comes out of an assumption that the landscape of popular culture involves the clash of competing forces : the neurological appetites of the brain , the economics of the culture industry , changing technological platforms . The specific ways in which those forces collide play a determining role in the type of popular culture we ultimately consume . The work of the critic , in this instance , is to diagram those forces , not decode them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find it helpful to imagine culture as a kind of man-made weather system . Float a mass of warm , humid air over cold ocean water , and you 'll create an environment in which fog will thrive . The fog does n't appear because it somehow symbolically reenacts the clash of warm air and cool water . Fog arrives instead as an emergent effect of that particular system and its internal dynamics . The same goes with popular culture : certain kinds of environments encourage cognitive complexity ; others discourage complexity . The cultural object-the film or the video game-is not a metaphor for that system ; it 's more like an output or a result . // The forces at work in these systems operate on multiple levels : underlying changes in technology that enable new kinds of entertainment ; new forms of online communications that cultivate audience commentary about works of pop culture ; changes in the economics of the culture industry that encourage repeat viewing ; and deep-seated appetites in the human brain that seek out reward and intellectual challenge . To understand those forces we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interact with one another : economics , narrative theory , social network analysis , neuroscience. // This is a story of trends , not absolutes . I do not believe that most of today 's pop culture is made up of masterpieces that will someday be taught alongside Joyce and Chaucer in college survey courses . The television shows and video games and movies that we 'll look at in the coming pages are not , for the most part , Great Works of Art . But they are more complex and nuanced than the shows and games that preceded them . While the Sleeper Curve maps average changes across the pop cultural landscape-and not just the complexity of single works-I have focused on a handful of representative examples in the interest of clarity .
