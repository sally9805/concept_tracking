Witch-girl <p> DEEP IN THE WOODS , gathering fungus for the Bone Witch 's supper , Katya heard the firebird call her name . " Katea-katea-katea .... " Brushing tangled black hair from sea-green eyes , she searched for the bird , seeing only tall pine trunks and blue bars of sky . Her bright homespun dress had the red-orange firebird embroidered on the bodice , done in silk from Black Cathay , and the Barbary cloth called Crimson . She had stitched it herself on sunless winter days . Katya called out , " Here I am . Come tell what you see . " <p> She listened . Insects hummed in hot pine-scented air . Farther off she heard a woodpecker knocking . She called again , " Come to me . Come to me . Come tell what you see . " <p> Now that she was fully grown , Katya never feared the woods by daylight . Leopards , troll-bears , lycanthropes , and forest sprites lurked between the trees , waiting to make a meal of the unwary . But by day the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No lynx or leopard could stir a foot without birds calling and squirrels chattering . All Katya need do was listen . Night was another matter . But the Bone Witch did not let her out at night . Nor would the Witch let her leave the hut without her slave collar and protective rune . Each morning she made Katya repeat her invisibility spell . She was valuable property , the Witch told her . " I have not raised you to feed some hungry troll-bear  --  not when you are finally becoming useful . " <p> Katya saw things differently . She began life as a girl-child thrown away in time of war and famine . Survival taught her to make the best of today , for tomorrow was bound to be worse . It taught her to lie instinctively , and never to shit where she meant to sleep . And to trust in her luck , which had kept her from the fate of hundreds like her . Death had had ample chance to take her , making Katya think she was being saved for something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine she was given to the Witch for two handfuls of salt and a cattle pox cure . The family feeding her figured they were doing everyone a favor . " The Witch can better provide for your We are poor , " the father informed her  --  as if she had somehow not noticed , sleeping on straw between the hearth and the hogs  --  " while you are stubborn and willful . " His wife agreed . " Getting you to obey is like trying to teach a cat to fetch . " Had Katya been a boy , it would have been different . But she was a girl , naturally wanton , unruly , frivolous and amoral , a growing threat to their son 's virtue . They were duty-bound to keep her chaste and ignorant , then give her to some man in marriage  --  a dead loss to the family . Better by far to give her to the Bone Witch . <p> Only their lazy son objected . Not the least threatened , he wanted her around . Without her , who would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath ? He had promised to rape her when they got bigger . <p> Katya herself had said nothing . Even at nine , she had a stubborn sense of self-worth that regularly got her whipped . People called her changeling and worse , with her pert ways and wicked green eyes  --  a girl switched at birth for a defiant demon-child . Bundling up her straw doll and wooden spoon , she took a seat in the father 's cart . They lurched off , crossing the Dys at Byeli Zamak , headed for the Iron Wood . All she could think was that she was to become a witch girl . And witches were burned . <p> But that was years ago . And she had not been burnt  --  not yet at least . By now she had spent half her life in the woods . She knew which mushrooms were food , and which sent you on flights of fancy . Which berries were sweet and which were deadly nightshade , which herbs cured and which herbs killed . Having nothing of her own , she happily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every screech and cry in the trees spoke to her . When it was safe , she spoke back . <p> " Katea-katea-katea .... " The call came closer . Like her , the firebird was a curious soul , and could be coaxed with low soft calls . He hated to think of anything happening in his woods without him telling the world about it . <p> Picking up her bark basket , she headed for the sound , fording a shallow stream to enter a fern-choked glade ringed by stands of slim silver birch . Birches loved the light and fought to fill any sort of clearing . At the far end of the glade she skirted a pond frequented by red deer and herons . On the bare bank she saw pug marks . <p> Kneeling amid the bracken , she felt the tracks with her fingers . The ground was hard , and the claw prints worn and splayed with age . Three nights ago , after the rain when the moon was full , an old female leopard came from the same direction she had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aiming for the thickly wooded crest separating the forest from the cultivated lands beyond . Any leopard with business beyond the ridge could easily be a stock thief or man-eater . <p> Not a cat she cared to meet . Stomach tensed , she looked about . Mossy patches shone like polished jade . The protective rune on her armlet shielded Katya from magic  --  but not from fang or claw . Straightening up , she set out again , keeping the breeze at her back . Leopards did not know humans have no sense of smell , and never stalked from upwind  --  so she need only worry about what lay ahead . These were her woods . Let some old leopard scare her , and she would never go out at all . <p> " Katea-katea-katea .... " She spotted a flash of orange among the pine trunks . The bird waited at the crest of the ridge . <p> And not just the firebird , but a fire as well . Black oily smoke billowed from beyond the ridge crest , smearing clear blue sky . Hairs rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelled the smoke because the wind was behind her  --  but she knew where it came from . Byeli Zamak was burning . <p> Topping the ridge , she stopped to stare . This was as far as the slave collar allowed her to go . Below her the forest ended . Rolling steppe spread out from the foot of the ridge , broken by loops of river , dark patches of ploughland , and the onion domes of village churches . Between her and the steppe , guarding the fords of the Dys , stood a huge round tower seven stories tall with walls twenty feet thick  --  Byeli Zamak , the White Castle . Smoke poured from the tower . Katya pictured the inferno inside , fed by grain and oil stored in the basement , burning up though the wooden floors , feeding on gilt furniture , Barbary tapestries , Italian paintings , and canopied beds . A cornerstone of her world was consumed in flames . <p> She came from these settled lands . Somewhere out there she had been born . Somewhere out there her family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sown with bones and watered by blood . Constant strife had consumed her family , and almost made an end to her . She had begged in those villages , and slept in the painted doorways of those churches , waking to find crows and ravens waiting to make a meal of her . <p> When she was given to the Witch , all that changed . Her slave collar kept her penned in the woods  --  where the worst she need fear was leopards and troll-bears . Even when old King Demitri died , Byeli Zamak remained , towering over the fords of the Dys  --  the gatehouse to the Iron Wood . King and gold-domed capital were the stuff of faerie tales , but Byeli Zamak was solid and real , part of Katya 's landscape , built by earth giants from native stone . And now it burned . Her first thought was to tell the Bone Witch . <p> " Katea-katea .... " the firebird called again , this time from right overhead . Looking up , she saw the flame-colored jay perched on the limb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prince of the bird clan , the fire orange jay was a wickedly mischievous trickster , a merciless nest robber and accomplished mimic . Katya had heard him perfectly imitate the screaming whistle of a hawk , just to see what havoc he could wreak . <p> " Is this what you saw ? " Katya tilted her head toward the inferno below . Just like a jay to revel in someone else 's misfortune . He squawked back at her , this time giving the man call . Jays greeted every predator with a different call . Warnings did little good if you did not know whether to look out for a leopard , or a hawk , or a lynx . The man call was totally distinct . Jays did not use it for her or the Witch . <p> Hearing a waxwing whistle , Katya turned to see a roe deer bound up the slope and disappear over the ridge . Something was coming . Something alarming enough to flush a doe from cover . The firebird flew off , still making the man call . <p> From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridge . A horse was coming up from the fords , carrying something heavy and clanking . She whispered her invisibility spell . So long as she remained still and silent , no one could see her . Or so the Witch said . So far it had never failed . <p> She watched the rider top the ridge . Bareheaded , he rode slumped forward , eyes half shut , his soot-stained blue and white surcoat covering a body encased in steel  --  a man-at-arms , maybe even a knight , just managing to stay atop a big gray charger . Her heart went out to him . He looked so hurt and handsome , his long elegant eyelashes wet with tears . Bloody clots in his fashionable pudding-basin haircut dripped red streaks down proud cheekbones , past genteel lips . His beardless face made him look young , marking him as a foreigner . Or a eunuch . <p> Here was her storm petral : strong and beautiful , but a sure sign of the whirlwind to come . So long as Byeli Zamak had held for the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gather sticks and snare squirrels , stripping bark for their shoes and stealing honey from the bees . On May Day they came singing , their arms full of flowers , celebrating the return of spring , slipping off in pairs to make love upon the forest floor  --  while she watched , invisible and intrigued . In summer the forest rang with their axes  --  the nearest thing they had to weapons . It was a flogging offense for a serf to have a bow , or a boar spear . Death to be caught with a sword . <p> But this stranger had a huge sword slung across his back , and his torn surcoat bore the embattled blue bend of the King 's Horse Guards . His crested helm hung from his saddle bow , alongside an ugly saw-toothed war hammer . Hunched forward , he carried something heavy in the crook of his shield arm , wrapped in silk embroidery , tucked against his armored breast . She stood stock still , letting him rattle past , close enough to touch . <p> When he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after him , slipping silently from tree to tree , following the bird calls down the ridge onto the forest floor . Tiny red flecks of blood shone on green fern fronds , marking his trail for her . <p> Now the breeze was full in her face , which she did not like . A leopard could come up behind her , stalking her as easily as she trailed this knight . Worse yet , the breeze brought the foul scent of a troll-bear 's lair , faint but growing stronger . The rotting corpse smell of discarded carcasses , mixed with the rank odor of the troll-bear 's droppings , was unmistakable , like smelling a long dead lizard on a hot day . Only the image of the knight 's hurt face kept her going . <p> She nearly caught up with her knight beneath a cool coppice of oaks . Leaves rustled like water overhead and the rattle of armor had ceased but the smell of horse droppings , followed by a nervous whinny , warned her she was getting too close . Sinking to all fours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why he had stopped . Had he smelled the trollbear ? <p> Her knight had dismounted . Kneeling in the bracken beside his horse , he attacked the ground with a big saxe knife , digging a hole in the dark earth . She watched patiently . When he had dug down the length of his arm , he sheathed the knife , and reached for an embroidered bundle lying beside him . Gently he lowered the bundle into the hole . Whatever it was had to be something precious  --  she could tell by how he handled it . A gold icon perhaps . Or a great crystal goblet . Or a dead baby . <p> He carefully covered over the hole , hiding his work with fallen leaves . Then he looked up , sensing he was watched , staring straight at her . But she stayed still as a fawn , and the spell held . Drained by the simple act of digging , he heaved himself onto his horse , no mean feat in full armor . Then he lurched off upwind , headed for the troll-bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savage both horse and rider , cracking her knight 's armor like a badger breaking open a snail . <p> When the carrion odor got unbearable , his horse stopped again , refusing to go on . She waited for her knight to turn or dismount , but he stayed slumped in his saddle , eyes closed , his horse nervously cropping the bracken . Warning calls died away and the woods grew still A good sign . Either the troll-bear was gorged senseless , or away from its den . Shrugging off her spell , she stepped out from between the trees , slowly walking toward her knight . His horse saw her first , snorting and shying . Speaking softly , she reached out and took the reins , " Have no fear . I will take you to good grass and water . " <p> Her knight opened his eyes , which were blue and alert . He smiled at what he saw , saying , " Mort Dieu , I am dead . " He did not look very dead , clinging stubbornly to his saddle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven . " <p> " I am no angel , " she told him . She was a witch-child , willful , disobedient and hopelessly damned . <p> His smile widened . " Then a forest sprite , young and beautiful . What more could a vagabond want ? " He spoke with a funny foreign accent , but his tone told her he was friendly . Gently turning the tired horse 's head , she led him slowly downwind away from the troll-bear 's lair . Her knight swayed alarmingly in the saddle . " Fair nymph , " he called down to her . " Where are you taking us ? " <p> She smiled over her shoulder . " To water . " He was by far the most marvelous thing she had ever found in the woods , and she wanted to see him with his face washed . <p> Leading the horse back to the base of the ridge t to where a spring burst from beneath tall triangular rocks  --  she helped her knight dismount . Sitting him down , she wet a cloth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She liked his handsome beardless face , firm and manly , but smooth to the touch . His scalp wound was bloody but not deep , and merely needed to be cleaned , then sewn shut . Luckily she knew which plants produced natural antibiotics , had been gathering them for the Witch . <p> He watched as she worked , smiling ruefully . " Just when you wonder what you are fighting for , Heaven sends a reminder . ' <p> " What reminder is that ? " She searched through her bark basket for the right leaves . <p> " You really do not know , do you ? " <p> " No . That is why I asked . " Her knight had a funny way of talking even for a foreigner . She crushed the leaves with a rock , mixing them with water from the spring . <p> " I have had a most damnable day , " he told her , " trying to hold Byeli Zamak for your infant Prince Ivan . Besieged by the boy 's own uncle , upholding the honor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pains . Just when I think I can not go on  --  that there is nothing in this benighted land worth saving  --  you come along . Proving me completely wrong . " <p> " This will hurt , " she warned him , parting his hair to expose the wound . <p> " Certainement ; so far today , everything has . " Taking that as assent , she poured her makeshift potion onto the bloody gash . He shouted in protest , raising a steel-gloved hand to shield his head . " Merde ! Does Mademoiselle mean to murder me too ? " <p> She grabbed his gauntlet to keep it away from the wound . " No . This will help you . I swear . " She found her embroidery needle with her free hand . <p> He relaxed . " C'est bien , c'est bien . Mademoiselle merely took me by surprise . " He sat stoically while she poured potion on the needle , then began sewing his scalp back together , wincing when she tightened a stitch , but otherwise acting as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I call Mademoiselle ? " <p> " Katya , " she replied shyly , resisting the impulse to invent . She wanted him to know her name . <p> " Enchante . Sir Roy d'Roye , Chevalier de l'Etoile , et le Baron d'Roye . At your service . " He winced again , as her needle went in . " What does Mademoiselle do when not torturing wounded knights ? " <p> She pulled the stitch tight , saying softly , " I serve the Bone Witch . " <p> " A Witch ? But of course . And a wicked one too , from the way that potion burned me .... " <p> " But she is merely my foster mother . My real mother was a queen . And I am a princess . " Not knowing who her parents were , she felt free to invent royal ones . <p> Baron d'Roye raised an eyebrow . " Princess in disguise , I presume ? " <p> " Of course , " she replied scornfully . " Why else would I be dressed like a peasant ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Shush ! " she whispered . From atop the ridge came the firebird 's man call . She listened harder . The call came again , fading as the bird took flight . Someone was coming . She asked , " Are there men after you ? " <p> " Indeed , though for no good reason . " <p> She hastily finished her stitching , saying , " I must hide you . " She had no fear for herself , but the thought of seeing her newfound knight hurt or killed was too much to bear . Helping him to his feet , she guided him up the rocks to a protruding shelf where two boulders formed a tiny cave between them , too high up to be seen from the spring . She shoved him inside , saying , " Stay here . " <p> " Only if your majesty promises to come for me , " he replied . <p> " I will . " She truly wanted to see more of him , only not right now . Not with men coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She pushed him further into the cave , where there was no chance of him being seen from below . <p> " Bring food , " he begged . <p> " I will , " she hastily agreed . <p> " And wine . " <p> She did not bother to answer , scrambling back down the rocks to the spring . Taking his mount 's reins , she turned the horse away from the spring . <p> " Good wine . If your highness has it . " <p> Still thirsty , the horse balked at being led off by a stranger . She had to heave on the reins to get him pointed back the way she wanted to go . Her knight called down to her , " And what about my horse ? " <p> " I will hide him too , " she promised , pulling harder , hauling the unwilling animal away from the spring . <p> " Au revoir , " he called out . <p> " Silence , please , " she shouted back , mortified to be making so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charger away from rest and water , she doubled back on their original tracks . Anyone seeing the return prints would have no reason to search out the cave , and would follow the trail she was making . Katya felt confident she could lose them  --  these were her woods . <p> When she had put distance between herself and the spring , she found a swift brook and splashed along it , letting the running water hide their trail . Spotting a good place to leave the stream  --  a rock shelf that would not take hoof prints  --  she deliberately passed it by . Downstream from the rock shelf she let the horse stray , making tracks on the bank , then leading him back into the water , and up onto the opposite bank . When she was satisfied with her false trail , she carefully retreated upstream , leading the horse out over the rocks , trying her utmost not to leave tracks . <p> She stayed on hard ground until she was well out of sight of the stream , and could no longer hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree and went back alone . Walking as lightly as she could , she covered up any sign of the horse 's passing , smoothing over stray prints , and sprinkling dust where they had wet the rocks . When she reached the stream , she whispered her spell , lying down to watch . <p> She waited , her heart beating against the hard stone . On the far side of the stream she saw a splendid spider web , shot with rainbows . Worth coming back for when she was not so busy . In the meantime she thought about her knight . He had a funny foreign way of talking , but that only made him more special . He had a good heart as well , she knew by the way he spoke to her . He even seemed to like her , though that was a lot to hope for . <p> First she heard warning calls  --  the indignant chatter of a red squirrel , the rasping cry of a frightened pine tit . Followed by the voices of men , and the neighing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks , looking for the spot where she left the water . <p> One huge fellow in half-armor and big bucket-topped riding boots urged his mount up onto the rock shelf , coming so close she could count the flanges on the heavy steel mace hanging from his saddle bow . Matted hair and flecks of blood clung to the sharp steel . He wore his sallet tipped back , searching the ground for tracks . His hard bearded face could not compare to the clean elegant features of Sir Roy d'Roye , Chevalier de l'Etoile . But his surcoat had the same embattled blue bend as her knight 's  --  charged with a sable crescent , the badge of Prince Sergey Mikhailovich , Grand Duke of Ikstra . Crown Prince Ivan 's belligerent uncle . She held her breath as he studied the spot where she led the charger out of the stream . Did he see something ? A crushed leaf or overturned stone ? The scrape mark of a steel shoe ? <p> Calls came from downstream . They had found her false trail . Prince Sergey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream . She was safe  --  for now . When the calls faded into the forest , she slid back off the rocks , and carefully made her way to where she had tethered the horse . The Witch would scold her if she did not return soon with her bark basket full of herbs and fungus . <p> As she set out , clouds of little white butterflies whirled up from patches of sunlight , fluttering between the horse 's legs , then darting off between the trees . The deeper she went into the woods , the less she worried about hiding her trail . The only warning calls were for her . At the head of Long Lake , she saw wild swans swimming on clear water fringed by pines . <p> Beyond the lake the pine wood ended . On the far side stood a forest of black iron trunks with stark metal branches  --  the Iron Wood  --  a cold dark barrier reeking of magic , stretching over the hills to the east , lifeless and forbidding . She led the reluctant horse into the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest sounds faded . No woodpeckers beat at the hard metal bark . No squirrels ran along the blade-like limbs . No living beasts made their home in the Iron Wood  --  just trolls and siren spirits , witches and the walking dead . <p> Happy to be nearly home , she threaded her way through the thorny metal maze . Finally a clearing appeared ahead , a white patch amid the black tangle . She led the big war horse up to a tall white hut made entirely of bones , long white thigh bones as big as a man , stacked one atop the other like grisly logs . Serfs called them dragon bones , but Katya knew better . They came from a long-haired , elephant-trunked monster that once roamed the northern tundra , bigger by far than any Barbary elephant . She had seen their great curved tusks in a forest bone pit , along with bits of the hairy hide . <p> Huge antlers from an ancient giant elk hung above the Bone Hut 's leather door . Swallows nested in nooks beneath the eves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Their parents flew back and forth , chattering at her , then streaking off in the direction of Long Lake , coming back with ants , gnats , wasps , and assassin bugs to feed their young . <p> Slowly the skin door swung open , and the Bone Witch emerged . Older than sin , and grim as death , the Witch wore a knuckle bone necklace and a linen winding sheet for a dress . White hair hung down to bare skeletal feet . Around her thin waist was a wormwood belt , supporting the thief-skin bag that held her charms . The horse backed and snorted at the sight of her . <p> She muttered a charm and the shying charger relaxed . " A beautiful beast , " the Bone ' Witch declared . " Where did you find him ? " <p> " In the woods . " Katya had always brought lost or strayed animals out of the woods . Fallen eagle chicks . Little lame squirrels . Orphaned leopard cubs . This war horse was by far her most impressive find . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Witch had warned her not to bring men into the Iron Wood . Abandoned cubs and a weary war horse were one thing  --  but no stray knights . No matter how handsome and helpless they looked . <p> She held out her basket to show she had not wasted the whole morning , saying , " Byeli Zamak has been burned . " <p> The Witch nodded , " I smelled it on the wind . " It was impossible to surprise the Bone Witch . <p> " And a leopard drank from the pond beneath the ridge . " <p> The Witch nodded again . " Three nights ago , when the moon was full . " Accepting the fungus , the Witch told her to give the gray charger a rubdown , " And see he has grass and water . You can not bring things home unless you care for them . " <p> " I will , I will , " she assured the Witch . And went to work at once , taking the horse around to the paddock behind the bone hut , rubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bark basket with food , she got out the Witch 's steel sickle , saying she would go cut grass at Long Lake . Nothing a horse could live on grew in the Iron Wood . <p> The Witch sniffed her basket . " And you will take food to the knight hiding in the cave by the spring ? " She gave a guilty nod . <p> " You are free to play with whatever you find in the woods , so long as your chores do not go wanting . " <p> " Oh , no ! I will gather more fungus , and webs for spinning . See , I am taking my spindle . " <p> The Witch shook her head . " Your youth will be the death of me . Always rushing life along . " <p> " No ! Never . " She kissed the Witch 's cold wrinkled lips . " You will always be here . " The Bone Witch had been in the Iron Wood forever . <p> " Of course , but what has that to do with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As the Witch predicted , she went straight to the cave , fearing she would find it empty . Nearing the spring , she stopped to listen . And heard nothing . Maybe he had obeyed her and stayed in the cave . More likely he was long gone . <p> She was thrilled to find herself wrong . " Bonjour , " he greeted her with a grin when she stuck her head into the cave . Heaving himself upright , he peered at her basket . " What is this ? Food , how wonderful ! Did you bring wine as well ? " She admitted she had not , having never so much as seen a grape . " Alas , too bad . But this is magic enough . Is there meat ? " <p> " Kalbasa . " She doled out a length of smoked sausage . <p> " Excellent , good old kalbasa , and bread too . What a wonderful wood sprite . Would there be caviar to go with it ? " <p> " There is . " She showed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long Lake teemed with sturgeon . <p> " Caviar ! Fantastic . What a feast ! " <p> " And ingot also . " She showed him the comb . <p> " Honey . How delightful . " <p> " And yogurt . " <p> " Ah yes , Markovy 's answer to sour milk . " <p> " And diynya . " <p> " Diynya ? " He looked puzzled . <p> She lifted the melon from the bottom of the basket , holding it out to him . " Diynya . " <p> " Of course . Diynya . How utterly delicious . " Taking the melon , he kissed her . " Merci beaucoup , Mademoiselle wood sprite . " <p> Her lips tingled from her first kiss by a grown man . The lumpish son of the family she lived with once held her down and tried to kiss her , but she bit his tongue . This was completely different . Delicious shivers shot through her , raising goosebumps from nipples to her groin . That he did it quickly and casually did not matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . It was enough that she remembered his , Sir Roy d'Roye , Chevalier de l'Etoile , et le Baron d'Roye . She felt utterly ecstatic , having her first real kiss come from someone so special . Not just a knight , but a lord . And hers to feed and care for . <p> Making her worry all the more for him . " Why do they want to harm you ? " <p> " Rank prejudice , " he replied , spreading caviar with his thumb . " Pure silly superstition . " <p> She broke open the melon , sipped the juice , and passed it to him . " But why would Prince Ivan 's uncle attack Byeli Zamak ? " <p> He heaved a sigh . " Mademoiselle does not live in a nation . Markovy is a collection of family quarrels with vague boundaries , whose preferred form of government is civil war . Being a foreign heretic , I do not give a lead sou who wins  --  but I swore an oath to your king to uphold his honor and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are having your head beat in . " <p> Getting over her goosebumps , she took her spindle from the basket , and started to spin spider 's thread from a web she had found on the way . Working the tiny threads relaxed her . <p> " Markovites are the most superstitious folk , witches and whatnot . Byeli Zamak supposedly held a magic treasure the Firebird 's Egg . A marvelous tale . And Prince Sergey is an utterly gullible Grand Duke , who thinks this mythical egg will make him master of Markovy . But I held Byeli Zamak for Prince Ivan , and King Demitri before him . As Castellan I would know if Byeli Zamak held such an egg . And it does not . " <p> Katya herself absolutely believed in the Firebird 's Egg . King Demitri had stolen the Egg from its nest deep in the Iron Wood , and kept it locked in a cool deep basement vault beneath Byeli Zamak  --  where it would not hatch and would always be his . It had Been King Demitri 's greatest treasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and miserable . The curse cost him both his wives , and all his children , except for Ivan , his heir . Why Ivan 's uncle would want the ill-fated egg was totally beyond her  --  but that did not mean it did not exist . <p> Her knight reid more stories , of far-off Gascony where he was born , and how he lost everything and ended up in exile . " I possess an astounding ability to choose the losing side . Counting this latest debacle at Byeli Zamak , I have been in half a dozen pitched fights  --  and have always come out a loser . A remarkable record , not easily achieved . When I sided with the English they lost to the King of France . When I switched my allegiance to the King he lost to the English . Scots in the French service call me ' Tyneman ' in tribute to my many defeats . An honor really . Any lout with a bit of ability can run off a string of victories . But to lose every time  --  that requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I can not believe your luck could be so bad . " She did not want to believe anything bad about him . <p> " Bad luck ? " He laughed . " Not in the least , my luck is excellent . Could not be better . " <p> " Really ? But is it not better to win than lose ? " <p> " Better perhaps  --  but not always easier . Anyone can survive a victory , just stay to the back and shout loudly . But surviving six defeats is a rare feat . Requiring more than a swift horse . Twice  --  at Lipan and St. Jacobon-Bris  --  I was the only one not killed or taken . That is phenomenal luck . " <p> " I mean , I do not believe you must always lose . " <p> He scoffed at her innocence . " Tell it to the Swiss . They were near unbeatable until I sided with them . " <p> By now dusk was settling outside the cave . Shafts of golden light slanted between the trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed and cared for , she needed to get back and cut grass for his horse , then see to the Witch 's supper , making the most of the long summer twilight . Sadly she took her leave , fairly sure he would not wander off in the short night , and meaning to be back by morning . D'Roye declared himself devastated to see her go , cheering her immensely . She finally had her knight in armor . Who cared if he was a foreigner , and somewhat the worse for wear  --  a footloose loser from some far-off land ? <p> Before returning to the Witch , she had one more thing to do . Cautiously she snuck up on the troll-bear 's lair , hoping her own scent would be hidden by the carrion stink . When she found the spot she sought , she dug down into the deep forest loam , using the Witch 's steel sickle . She glanced repeatedly over her shoulder , uncomfortably aware that she had watched her knight dig in this exact spot without him knowing it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches with her hands , not wanting to harm what lay hidden in the hole . Finally she felt something soft and warm beneath her fingers . Brushing aside the last of the dirt , she recognized the embroidered tapestry her knight had kept next to his armored breast . Unwrapping the tapestry , she felt the smooth hard surface underneath , the warm , living Firebird 's Egg . <p> She folded the tapestry back over the Egg , then refilled the hole , happy her knight had not lied to her . He claimed that as Castellan he would have known if Byeli Zamak held such a magical egg  --  and it did not . But that was because he had escaped Byeli Zamak with it , and buried it here by the troll-bear 's lair . Being a born romancer , she took such truthful misdirection as a sign of true love . <p> Prince Sergey <p> SHE MEANT to see her knight right after morning chores , before he could wander away from the cave  --  but the Bone Witch had a dozen things for her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallow 's nests taken from under the eves , and her pet rats turned loose , then her favorite fetishes hung on branches in the Iron Wood . So many pointless tasks that she suspected the Witch of tying to keep her from seeing D'Roye . The Bone Witch 's motives were as obscure as her methods . <p> The rats seemed happy to be set free , but the swallows complained bitterly , chattering shrilly and darting at her head . It was useless to tell them that Witch ordered the mass removal . While she battled indignant swallows , the Witch sat at her bone table writing on thin strips of Chinese paper in her little cramped script . Tying these tiny messages to the feet of her carrier pigeons , the Witch released the pigeons one by one , sending them off into the blue summer sky . <p> Katya asked what was so important that the Witch must tell the world . The Bone Witch shushed her . " Be patient . In time all comes clear . " <p> So the Witch always said . Katya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked positively bare . Since the day she arrived the chaos of her new home had fascinated her  --  fetishes decorating bone rafters , swallows darting in and out , pigeons cooing in the eves , rats peering from wicker cages , all lit by tulip-shaped paper lanterns . It took her mind off the terror of belonging to a witch . She fully expected to be cooked and eaten , unless the Witch chose to have her raw . Soon Katya realized that she would have to do the cooking  --  but by then chores and boredom made her treasure the hut 's distractions . Now it chilled her to see her home so neat . All the animals were gone , except for her knight 's horse in the paddock out back . She hoped this latest mad impulse did not last . <p> Finally the Witch agreed to let her go . " There is nothing else for you to do here . Now go and make your way in the world . Be smart . Be brave . Think of me now and again . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how far you go , or what you become , I will be with you . " <p> Katya told her she was only going to take breakfast to her knight . And her slave collar kept her from going much farther  --  but the Witch had a way of seeing grand drama in the most mundane things , like the song of a lark , or the first buds of spring . " Do not worry , I will be back in the afternoon . " <p> " No , you wo n't , " the Bone Witch replied . " Always remember , I tried to care for you and teach you trollcraft . Now recite your spell . " <p> She recited her invisibility spell , grabbed up her basket and headed for the Iron Wood , happy to be free of the Witch  --  if only for a while . <p> She did not get far . There were no warning cries in the Iron Wood . No birds or squirrels to keep watch for her . She was concentrating on the winding trail through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wind . Horses meant men . She froze , whispered her spell , and waited  --  hoping her heart was not banging too loud . <p> Hearing the clip-clop of iron-shod hooves , she realized they were riding down the crooked trail toward the Bone Witch 's hut  --  coming in twos , to save getting slashed by spiked branches . In a moment they would be riding right over her , invisible or not . She turned and dashed back the way she had come . Byeli Zamak had been gone for only a day , and already men were coming farther than she ever thought possible . At the clearing in the metal wood , the Bone Witch stood waiting by her skin door , a grim smile on her wrinkled face . Katya told the sorceress she had heard horsemen coming , but the Witch merely nodded . Had the Witch known about these horsemen ? Probably . The Bone Witch had sent her off with her basket and spell , knowing full well that she would not get far . <p> Hoofbeats grew louder as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside the Witch , curious to see what sort of horsemen dared come into the Iron Wood . But the first figure to appear was not on horseback  --  and only half a man . Man-shaped and naked , he strolled lithely into the clearing , covered head to foot with soft brown hair . His eyes were wolf 's eyes . Canine fangs protruded from thin smiling lips . <p> Lycanthrope . She had never seen one like this before  --  few had and lived . He was not : the harmless sort who totally shed human form to run with the wolves and mate with the bitches . He was a soulless demon from deep in the Iron Wood  --  the absolute worst of wolf and man . Or so the Witch always told her . <p> Behind him rode an incongruous pair . The taller of the two was a steel-helmeted horse archer wearing a blue Horse Guard 's brigandine studded with silver nail heads . He had a huge dead swan hanging from his high saddle . Riding at his side was a dwarf mounted on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap . More horsemen filed into the clearing behind them , spreading out from their column of two 's .... horse archers , knights , and men-at-arms , followed by squires and valets , even a steward and a butler in their uniforms of office . And an Ensign , holding up a grand duke 's banner , with a black crescent and the lightning stroke sign of Ikstra . Beneath the banner rode Prince Sergey himself . Katya had never seen a prince of the blood before , but there was no mistaking this one . Grand Duke Sergey was a prince from the bootheels up , wearing silver-chased armor and a gold coronet on his old-fashioned great helmet . He had his visor tipped back and she could see the hard cold sheen in his pale blue eyes , glinting like dangerous ice in the spring . <p> He stared evenly at the aged Bone Witch w two of the most feared people in Markovy were meeting for the first time . Totally different , yet each in their own way absolutely terrifying . Prince Sergey , Grand Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morrow , grandmother , we are trailing a mounted knight , riding a gray war horse and wearing a blue-and-white surcoat , fie is most likely wounded . Have you seen him ? " <p> " No , my lord , " replied the Bone Witch . " Not him , nor anyone like him . " <p> " Strange , " mussed Prince Sergey , " our wolfman trailed his horse straight to this clearing . " The Lycanthrope stood waiting , a hideous look on his fanged face , clearly hoping to make a meal out of someone . " He was Castellan of Byeli Zamak , and claims to be a baron . " <p> " And yet I have not seen him , " the Witch insisted . <p> Prince Sergey looked to the dwarf sitting on his pony . Rising in his saddle , the dwarf took a deep breath through his nose . Two more sniffs , and the dwarf settled back in the saddle , saying , " She is telling the truth . " <p> Prince Sergey nodded . Then his gaze turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay her squirrel tax . " What about the girl ? Has she seen him ? " <p> The " girl " gulped . " No , my lord , never . " She shook her head vigorously , shrinking back beside the Witch . <p> Prince Sergey looked again at the dwarf . This time the little man swung off his pony , and walked over to her . His head came up to Katya 's waist . Lifting his nose , he sniffed her belly , then ran his nostrils down her thigh . He stepped back , saying , " She is lying . " <p> Sergey raised an eyebrow . " Has she seen the Castellan ? " His dwarf shrugged . The little man was a lie sniffer , not a mind reader . His majesty turned back to her , " Have you seen a knight wearing blue and white ? " <p> She had no good answer , caught between her need to lie , and knowing the dwarf would sniff her out . Anything she said would put her at the mercy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was the one who had found her . Without him , this clumsy crowd of horsemen could not have trailed her from the stream  --  but a Lycanthrope can track a mouse on a moonless night . <p> " Well , have you seen him ? " the Grand Duke demanded . <p> Before she could think of some truthful misdirection , a shout of triumph came from the back of the Bone Hut . A couple of squires came around the corner proudly leading her knight 's horse . Someone called out , " That 's his horse . The big gray that belongs to the Castellan . " <p> Prince Sergey stared hard at the horse , then looked back at her . " Have you seen the knight who rode this horse ? " <p> She nodded dumbly , unable to come up with anything but the truth , though she knew it would doom her . <p> " Good , " the Grand Duke concluded , " we are at last getting somewhere . Do you know where he is ? " <p> " Not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cave . In fact she fervently hoped he was . <p> Prince Sergey smiled , a chilling , terrible sight . " Nothing in life is certain  --  but I wager this will be sure enough . " He turned to his Ensign , saying , " Pay her for the girl . " <p> Taking his reins in his banner hand , the Ensign fished a gold coin out of his purse , tossing it at the naked feet of the Witch . The Bone Witch made no attempt to pick up the coin . " That is for the girl , " the Ensign explained . <p> " She is not for sale , " replied the Witch . <p> " Give her the whole purse , " the Grand Duke ordered impatiently . His Ensign tossed the purse down beside the coin  --  but the Witch ignored it as well . <p> " What do you want , grandmother ? " Grand Duke Sergey seemed astonished that the Bone Witch refused his generosity . <p> " For you to leave . " There was a hint of warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Sergey agreed , " when we have the girl . " <p> " She is under my protection , " the Witch insisted . <p> Grand Duke Sergey glared at her . Katya could feel the tension in the clearing . Two dozen armed men sat loafing in the saddle , backed by valets , pages , a steward and butler . Horses looked on with equine curiosity . The Lycanthrope stood waiting , aching to use his fangs and claws . " By rights I could have you burned , " Prince Sergey pointed out . <p> " Do it if you dare , " replied the Witch , unworried by the prince 's power . <p> Sergey motioned for his archers to dismount , saying " Seize the girl . " <p> Horrified , Katya stepped back toward the skin door . This was all her fault . She had brought the horse to the Bone Hut . An archer tried to brush past the Witch to grab her  --  but the Bone Witch shoved him sideways , landing him in a heap . Two archers seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster than the eye could follow , sending the armored pair flying to opposite ends of the clearing . Another archer tried to draw his sword , but the Witch reached out and grabbed his wrist , twisting it until it snapped . His blade dropped from limp fingers . <p> Archers fell back , appalled by the old woman 's strength . The Lycanthrope dropped to a crouch , prepared to spring Prince Sergey shouted , " Use your bows  --  but do not hit the girl . 1 will flay the man that misses . " <p> A half dozen arrows leaped from their bows , striking the Witch in the chest and hip . She hardly even winced , standing between Katya and the men . Katya clung to the skin door , her fist jammed in her mouth , stifling a scream , aghast at what she had done . <p> More arrows thudded into the Witch . Painfully the old woman turned to face her . The Bone Witch 's chest looked like a bloody pin cushion . Arrows continued to hit her from behind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she meant to speak . All that came out was a horrible gargling sound , followed by a great gout of blood . Shocked and sickened , Katya watched the Witch sink slowly to her knees . <p> " Stop shooting ! Stop shooting ! " Sergey cried . " You will hit the girl . " Silence settled over the clearing as tears poured down Katya 's cheeks . Half a dozen bows were pointed at her , arrows knocked and ready . She could see their gleaming chiseled steel points aimed at her chest . The Witch lay at her feet , feathered with arrows . Katya too expected to die  --  if not now , then soon . <p> Prince Sergey broke the silence , spurring his mount to put himself between her and the archers , shouting , " Down bows ! Damn you ! Down bows ! " <p> Hurriedly his men obeyed . Wiping her tears away , Katya seized the Prince 's stirrup . " Why did you kill her ? " she wailed . " I am the one who lied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disbelief , as if astonished she could speak . " The Witch did not know where he was . You did . " So the Witch died , and she lived  --  for now . " You do know where the Castellan is ? " Sergey wanted to be sure . <p> She nodded . Any other answer would be her death warrant . <p> " And you can take us to him ? " <p> She nodded again . <p> " Good . " Prince Sergey pulled his boot from his stirrup , planted the heel on her shoulder and shoved , sending her sprawling . He waved to his men , " Burn the place . Burn the Witch 's body . Burn it all . " <p> Prince Sergey cantered off . For a moment she lay looking up at blue sky framed by black iron tree tops , her breath coming in ragged gasps . Without warning , a big bearded archer took the Prince 's place . Looking down at her , he laughed , saying , " Here 's a cute young case of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Give your middle leg a rest , " another archer advised . <p> " What do you mean ? " the man asked indignantly . " I 've not been fucked in a fortnight . " <p> " Small wonder . " The second archer helped her to her feet , brushing the dirt off her dress , which was spattered with the Bone Witch 's blood . <p> Someone called out , " Does she have a name ? " <p> " Do you ? " asked the archer . <p> Of course , she thought  --  but all she said was , " Katya . " <p> " She calls herself Katya . " The horse archer was speaking to a huge man in an oversized suit of plate armor . Mounted on a big black Frisian , he towered over everything , seeming to reach right to the ridgepole of the Bone Hut . He wore the same blue-white surcoat as her knight , but many times bigger , and marked with the sword-and-shield badge of a Master-at-arms . Tipping back the visor on his German sallet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where do you come from , girl ? " <p> Scared senseless , she still had the presence of mind to lie . " I am the daughter of a Kazak herman , Kaffa Khan . Harm me , and he will come with a tureen of horse archers to hunt you all to death . " <p> He laughed , saying , " Have knee-high give her a sniff " <p> She had forgotten about the Dwarf . Too much had happened since she last saw the little man . He walked over and took a deep sniff , then turned to the Master-at-arms , saying , " She lies . " <p> The Master-at-arms did not look surprised- her lie had been feeble at best . " Come , my little khanum , give us the truth . Or I will see you suffer . " <p> She admitted she did not know who her parents were , saying , " I was raised here , by the Witch . " Mentioning the Bone Witch made her want to cry , but she stopped herself . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stared dumbly up at him . What a stupid question to ask a witch-child . How could anyone be both damned and virtuous ? <p> " There 's your answer , " the lecherous horse archer chuckled . " She does not even know what you are asking . " <p> The Master-at-arms grinned , " Well , it is bad luck to execute a virgin .... " <p> " Especially for the virgin , " a horse archer added , getting a laugh from his fellows . <p> The Master-at-arms signaled for silence . " But in your case we will risk it . Stop your lying , and lead us to the Castellan . Otherwise we will have you flayed and left to fry in the sun . Unlucky or not . Do you understand ? " <p> She understood . <p> He turned to the squires and archers , telling them to get busy , " Drag the Witch into the hut , and set it on fire . " None too happy with their task , archers dragged the Witch 's body into the Bone Hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Witch , then throw on firewood , furniture , and the contents of the winter clothes chests . Dousing the pile with cooking oil , they set it alight . Soon the Bone Hut was blazing away . She saw her life going up in smoke and flames  --  just like Byeli Zamak . <p> " Mount up , " the Master-at-arms ordered . Squires hoisted her aboard D'Roye 's gray charger . One of them handed her the reins , and something to go with them . Looking down , she saw it was her straw doll  --  the one she had brought with her when she first came to live with the Witch . The young squire who had given it to her looked embarrassed . Of all these men  --  from Grand Duke Sergey down to the lowest valet  --  this boy alone seemed ashamed for what they had done . <p> The Master-at-arms gave her a grin that was all beard and teeth , saying , " Now lead us to the Castellan . " She nodded , clutching the straw doll to her belly . Somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this alive and whole . But how that would happen , Heaven alone knew . <p> The Firebird 's Egg <p> MOUNTED ON her knight 's gray charger , she led the whole cavalcade along the winding trail out of the Iron Wood . The Master-at-arms rode beside her , with the dwarf mounted pillion behind him , and the Lycanthrope loping on ahead . Boxed in by armed ruthless men , she could neither lose them nor lie to them  --  not so long as they had the wolfman to track her , and the dwarf to sniff out her lies . Only a stroke of monumental good fortune could save her , and she had long ago learned she had to make her own luck . <p> Whenever the Master-at-arms questioned her directions , the dwarf made sure she told only the truth , putting a heavy burden on someone who always relied on lies . Whatever saved her now had to be the Lord 's honest truth . At the head of Long Lake , hot perfumed pine scent replaced the cold metal odor of the Iron Wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already learning to be wary of the archers . She turned west , straight for the ridge line separating the forest from the steppe . The Master-at-arms looked askance . " You are leading us back toward Byeli Zamak ? " <p> " That is where I left him , in a cave by the spring at the base of the ridge . " <p> " Is that so ? " he asked the dwarf riding behind him . <p> " She is telling the truth , " replied the dwarf , looking pleased that she had learned not to lie . <p> The Master-at-arms turned back to her . " And this is the shortest way there ? " <p> " Absolutely , " she assured him . The dwarf confirmed her . An east wind had blown all morning , and she was determined to lead them straight downwind , avoiding the roundabout way she came the day before . No need now to hide her tracks . " If I take you right to him , will you let me go ? " <p> " Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she was looking behind him at the dwarf , who glanced sharply up , saying nothing . Having a lie-sniffer riding on your horse 's rump worked both ways . She had seen that same look of contempt on the dwarf 's face when she tried to lie . The Master-at-arms did not mean to let her go . None of them did . Once she had served her purpose they would burn her as a witch . If they had not already promised her to the Lycanthrope . <p> As they plunged into the living wood , with its green trees and countless eyes , She heard a squirrel chatter , followed by the firebird 's cry . It was not the flame jay 's man call . She kept her eyes fixed on the path ahead , making sure the Master-at-arms got no warning from her . As the firebird 's cry faded behind her , she strained her ears , trying to tell what was happening at the back of the column . All she could hear was the horse archers , laughing and joking behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep their spirits up . <p> Suddenly a scream rang out . The Master-at-arms grabbed her reins , looking back down the column . They waited . The story tellers fell silent . She watched little white butterflies dance in the sunlight . Presently a horse archer on a bay mare came galloping up . " What happened ? " demanded the Master-at-arms . <p> " A leopard , " the horse archer gasped . <p> " A leopard ? " The Master-at-arms looked shocked . <p> " Yes , it dropped out of a tree on the last man in the column  --  Vasily , from Suzdal . He stopped to tighten his stirrup and take a piss . Before he could remount the cat was on him . By the time we got back to him , he was dead and the beast was gone . " <p> " That makes no sense , " complained the Master-at-arms . " A leopard attacking an armed man in daylight ? " And from upwind , Katya added to herself , carefully searching the trees . A wood tit stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry , " insisted the Master-at-arms . <p> The horse archer shrugged . " The cat did not act hungry . It just broke Vasily 's neck , then went on its way . " <p> The Master-at-arms snorted , " Which makes even less sense . Sling his body over a horse , and tell Prince Sergey we are ready to move . " The archer turned his bay mare about and went trotting back down the column . <p> Again they waited . Katya sat listening to the pines murmuring overhead . A woodpecker started to hammer , then stopped suddenly . Had it seen something ? Slowly the profane stories reappeared  --  " A nun , a bishop , and a brothel keeper are in a boat . The bishop says to the nun .... " She kept her ears tuned to the trees , listening for the woodpecker , and wondering why it was taking so long to get started again . <p> Finally Prince Sergey 's Ensign trotted up , asking the same question , " Are you ready to move on ? His highness means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Rolling his eyes , the Master-at-arms told him , " I sent a man back saying we were ready to fide . " <p> " What man ? " asked the Ensign . <p> This provoked another commotion . A search failed to find the messenger , but did discover his bay mare , nervously cropping bracken in a nearby clearing . Fresh blood shone on her saddle . The Master-at-arms exploded , " This is absurd . We can not sit here waiting to be eaten . Tell His Highness we are setting out  --  unless the leopard gets you first . " <p> She started up again at a brisk trot . No one complained . Not with bloodthirsty leopards stalking the column . Men kept twisting in their saddles , glancing over their shoulders , looking everywhere but ahead . She saw a familiar break in the pines , backed by a tall stand of oaks . Since they were headed downwind there was no warning but the cry of a crossbill , which the men ignored . Only the Lycanthrope looked uneasy , padding silently along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the werewolf froze , hairs quivering . She braced herself . This was it . The next seconds would decide if she lived or died . The Lycanthrope spun about : and vanished into the undergrowth . An archer called out , " What scared the wolfman ? Why has he run off ? " <p> As if to answer him , the troll-bear burst from his hidden lair , bellowing defiance at the intruders . Twice the size of a normal bear , with steel-hard hide and razor claws , the beast roared into the column , scattering men and horses . Rolling out of her saddle , Katya dropped to a crouch and whispered her spell . Instantly she vanished . <p> From her invisible crouch she got a close-up view of the swift horrific conflict . The troll-bear 's forepaws flailed about , mace-headed battering rams slashing through plate armor like parchment . The Master-at-arms seized a lance from a squire , slapped down his visor , and charged the monster full tilt . His lance shattered on the troll-bear 's hornlike hide . The enraged beast backhanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hind foot , then bit his horse 's head off . <p> None of the other heroes who captured her tried to stop the troll-bear . The whole column  --  six lances of Horse Guards , with their attendant squires , valets , and archers , along with Prince Sergey 's entourage of pages , Ensign , steward , and butler  --  vanished in an eyeblink , as if they too knew an invisibility spell . The troll-bear went howling after them , snapping pine saplings and uprooting boulders . <p> Which was why sensible woods creatures avoided a troll-bear 's lair . The carrion stink was like a viper 's hiss , a warning to unwary neighbors . Silence settled on the forest . Clutching her straw doll , she surveyed the new made clearing out the corner of her eyes . The worst part of being invisible was the inability to turn her head . Absolutely maddening when you wanted to know if it was safe to be seen . She was frozen in place staring at the armored leg of the Master-at-arms , sticking out from beneath a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been riding behind him . <p> Finally she made herself close her eyes , trusting in her ears to see behind her . Nothing . No warning cries , no rustle of leaves . No smell but the stink of troll-bear from somewhere upwind . She was free . <p> And alive . From the moment the Witch had died , she counted herself dead as well . Her demise seemed certain . She had let herself be tracked , and had gotten the Witch killed . And she was in the hands of men who meant to dispose of her in some grotesque fashion once she did their bidding . Now her life had been saved by a troll-bear . Few indeed could make that claim . <p> So what to do with her newfound freedom ? Her first thought was for her knight . He was at the heart of this . He and the Firebird 's Egg . She did not believe Prince Sergey would risk the Iron Wood just to put an end to some foreign born Castellan of Byeli Zamak . Love did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as important as the Egg he had carried . <p> Moving stealthily downwind , ears tuned to the slightest sound , she crept up on the rocks and spring . She did not think any of the men could have caught up with her , even if they escaped the troll-bear . But having gotten her life back , she did not mean to let down her guard . Hot afternoon air hung heavy and expectant . And unnaturally quiet . Beyond the bubbling spring , the forest seemed to be holding its breath . <p> Suddenly she heard the firebird 's shrill cry . She froze against a big boulder speckled with bird lime , whispering her spell . This was the second time today she had heard the bird 's warning . It was as if the jay were watching over her . This cry was different than any she had heard before , the man-call mixed with an unfamiliar trill . <p> As she strained to survey the rocks without moving her head , a heavy form dropped on her from atop the boulder . Hairy arms seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her struggles broke the invisibility spell , which had been no match for the Lycanthrope 's supernatural senses . She was merely an unarmed young woman , fighting immensely strong arms , while the man-beast 's fanged hairy face leered into hers . <p> Horrified , she struggled harder . Keeping her arms pinned , the Lycanthrope dragged her back away from the spring  --  but did nothing else to harm her . No clawing . No fangs in the neck . Not reassuring in the least , with his steel-like erection digging into the small of her back . <p> Then she felt the Lycanthrope relax . Looking up , she saw horsemen staring down at her . Prince Sergey sat bareheaded on his charger , having lost his gold-crowned helmet . His Ensign was beside him , along with a single horse archer , several frightened squires , and a bedraggled looking butler  --  all that was left of the proud cavalcade that had ridden boldly into the Iron Wood . The Lycanthrope must have been stalking ahead of them . Coming on her scent trail , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto her . <p> Prince Sergey trotted over to where she stood , glaring down at her . " Did you know we were riding into a troll-bear 's lair ? " <p> Her immediate impulse to lie died on her lips , when she spotted the dwarf riding behind the butler . She shook her head instead . " I will not tell you anything unless you let me go . " <p> " Be cooperative , " Prince Sergey warned . " I have only to say the word , and the beast holding you will savage you on the spot . " <p> " You will not learn a lot from that , " she pointed out . <p> " Yes , " Sergey admitted , " but I might very much enjoy it . " Nonetheless he waved to the wolfman . " Let her go , " <p> The Lycanthrope let go of her , a little victory , and likely to be her last . Katya took a deep breath , wishing she could just disappear right here . What had she done to deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see . Prince Sergey leaned forward in the saddle . " Now , tell us what we want to know . " <p> " If I do , will you let me go ? " She stared past the prince at the dwarf seated behind his butler . <p> " Just tell the truth , and you have nothing to fear . " <p> The dwarf 's nose wrinkled , as if he whiffed something foul . So much for honesty . Prince Sergey had no intention of freeing her . She closed her eyes , taking another slow breath , prolonging the inevitable . " What do you wish to know ? " <p> " Tell where the Castellan is , " Prince Sergey demanded , royally impatient . <p> " Right here , " came the cheerful reply . Her eyes flew open . There was her knight , standing tall and nonchalant , sword in hand , a wry smile on his handsome face . Seeing him appear out of nowhere was like suddenly getting her life back . He made a mocking bow to Prince Sergey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until late Castellan of Byeli Zamak . At your service . " <p> Sergey sat up in the saddle . " My God ! You ! Why did you not open Byeli Zamak to me ? " <p> Her knight shrugged armored shoulders . " You did not say s'il vous plait . King Demitri gave me Byeli Zamak to hold for his heir . " <p> " I am Prince Ivan 's uncle . Byeli Zamak should have come to me . " <p> " And it has , " D'Roye reminded him , smiling at his latest defeat . <p> Prince Sergey leaned forward again . " But not the Firebird 's Egg . " <p> " That is what brings us here . " Her knight looked smug . <p> " So you have the Egg ? " <p> " Not on me . But I know where it is . " <p> " Where ? " Sergey demanded . <p> " What will you pay to know ? " <p> " Half my kingdom ? " Sergey suggested sarcastically . <p> " I will give it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her and me , alive and ahorsed  --  that is all I ask . " <p> Katya fought back tears . Her knight had given up his hiding place , and the Egg he protected , all to save her . A foolish impetuous gesture that would probably get them both killed . Still , she was touched . <p> " Almost too cheap , " Sergey mused . " Generosity from an enemy is always suspect  --  but perhaps you are merely a fool . " <p> " Obviously . Pray indulge me nonetheless . " <p> " You , the girl , and two horses  --  easy enough . " Sergey lifted a steel-gloved finger . " After I have the Egg . " <p> " As you wish . " Keeping his big two-handed sword drawn , her knight turned to her . " Mademoiselle , I must go with these men  --  hopefully I will be coming back with a pair of horses . " <p> " She comes with us , " Sergey insisted . <p> D'Roye rolled his eyes apologetically . " Alas , Mademoiselle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is but a short way into the forest .... " <p> " By a stand of big oaks , " she reminded him . <p> His eyes lit up . " I see you know the place . " <p> She nodded excitedly . She knew better than he did . And the deeper they got into her woods , the safer they would be . Get far enough into the forest , and she and her knight were more than a match for any number of killers on horseback . But she did not say that aloud , for fear the killers would hear . She had to rely on him reading it in her smile . <p> He did seem to understand , setting out happily , not the least worried by the armed men around them , laughing , and making light of things . She wanted to tell him about the Bone Witch , but that too must wait . This time they approached the troll-bear 's lair from downwind- by far the safest direction . So long as you stayed out of the beast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as they whiffed the carrion scent , Prince Sergey 's men revolted , none of them wanting a rematch with the monster . Their horses too refused to go any farther , shying and whinnying at the fearful stench . <p> Sergey immediately demanded that the dwarf sniff her knight for a lie . D'Roye submitted with good grace , for once having nothing to hide . But the dwarf went right up to him , sniffing vigorously . Katya could guess why . The little man desperately hoped to smell a lie . If her knight was telling the truth , they would have to march straight back toward the troll-bear 's lair . <p> Finally , the dwarf admitted D'Roye smelled sincere . Sergey was forced to leave the horses and squires behind , but he bullied the Ensign , horse archer , and butler into accompanying him on foot . Katya did not fear any of these men half so much as she feared the Lycanthrope . <p> The dwarf did not get a choice . Like her , he was too valuable to leave behind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She went out of her way to comfort the little man , whose only concern was for the truth . He and the Witch were the only ones she had never been able to lie to , which she very much respected . " Stay close to me , " she told him , , " and I will try to see you are safe . " <p> He looked warily up at her , " Is that so ? " <p> " I thought you would know . " He was the one with the supremely educated nose . As they set out walking , she slid her hand inside her dress , stroking the straw doll hidden next to her breast , just for luck . <p> When they got to the oak grove , the butler had to go down on his beribboned knees and dig for the Egg with his bare hands . Prince Sergey would not let him use so much as a toothpick , for fear of harming the Egg . Her knight stood watching calmly , leaning on his big two-handed sword . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he immediately did , backing away toward the bushes . A bad sign  --  the little man who knew his master best was expecting the worst . <p> Reaching his hands into the hole , the butler drew forth the Firebird 's Egg . As he unwrapped the dirty tapestry , everyone stared in awe at Markovy 's greatest wonder . Except for the Lycanthrope , who kept his hungry eyes fixed on her . What had he been promised when Prince Sergey had the Egg ? <p> Her knight spoke first . " Excusez-moi , this may be exceptionally foolish of me , but I beg you to listen to the advice of your late king . " <p> " What advice ? " Sergey looked suspiciously at her knight , as if he was an insect with an especially annoying hum . <p> " King Demitri sent a deathbed message to me , ordering that this Egg be returned safely to its Nest . Not an easy task , but one I heartily endorse . There is a terrible curse on this Egg . How many lives has that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her knight was right , Byeli Zamak had been burned . And so had the Bone Hut . Prince Sergey 's proud company had been reduced to a scared handful , standing around the magical Egg . <p> Prince Sergey gave a snort of contempt . " We need no lessons from the loser . " <p> " There are worse things than losing , " her knight pointed out . " My own fortunes have improved mightily since I put that ill-fated Egg in the ground . " <p> " Really ? " Prince Sergey arched an eyebrow . <p> " Absolutely . " Her knight smiled at her . " I was beaten and bleeding , fleeing yet another defeat . But as soon as I parted from that Egg , there came this delightful forest nymph , stitching my wounds and serving me caviar . " <p> " How lucky for you , " Sergey laughed . " My own ambitions are a bit higher . " <p> Her knight shrugged , " To each their own . Hopefully , King Demitri will know I tried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He reached a steel-gloved hand out to her . <p> " You may inform Demitri in person . " Prince Sergey nodded to the Lycanthrope . " Kill him and the girl is yours . " <p> Faster than thought , the Lycanthrope leaped at D'Roye 's throat , claws extended . But her knight had expected treachery . His blade came up in a terrific backhand swipe . Only the wolfman 's supernatural agility saved him from being cut in two . Twisting in midair , the beast managed to evade the blade , landing on all fours . <p> All eyes were on her knight , so Katya stepped back against a tree , whispering her spell . The dwarf had already vanished into the undergrowth . Holding her breath , she stood rigid , smelling sap sweating from the pine behind her , watching the fight and wanting to help , but not knowing how . <p> D'Roye kept his sword between himself and the werewolf , feinting and slashing . Despite his speed and cunning , the Lycanthrope could not get past the flashing blade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got nicked in the shoulder and the ear . But the wolfman moved too fast for D'Roye to land a killing blow . Stalking sideways , he searched for an opening . <p> " Help the beast , " Prince Sergey commanded . " Take him from behind . " <p> His butler just stood there , stupidly holding the Egg  --  but the Ensign and horse archer obeyed , drawing their swords and trying to slide around behind D'Roye . So long as the Lycanthrope kept him busy in front , it would only be a matter of time before one of the others got at his back . <p> Being the bolder of the two , the Ensign was first to get in position . As D'Roye aimed a slash at the werewolf , the Ensign raised his own sword , stepping in to strike . <p> Seeing the Ensign lunge past her , Katya leaped forward , seizing the man 's sword arm . Coming out of nowhere , she took the Ensign by surprise . As he struggled to shake her off , D'Roye spun about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Groaning , the Ensign went down , rattling like a pile of dropped pans . <p> Instantly the Lycanthrope bounded at D'Roye . But her knight seemed to know what was coming . Ignoring the downed Ensign , he let his momentum spin him completely about . This time his backhand caught the Lycanthrope between the neck and collarbone , severing the beast 's jugular in a hideous spray of blood The werewolf landed in a gory heap at his feet . <p> Strong arms grabbed her from behind . The horse archer had not dared to take on D'Roye , but he seized her to use as a living shield . Prince Sergey whipped his sword out , and she felt the sharp point at her throat . " Stop , " the Grand Duke commanded . " Drop your sword or I will kill her . " <p> Her knight let his point drop , saying , " Come now , Your ' Highness , that is hardly sporting . Alt we want is to be on our way . " <p> " Drop your sword , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almighty I shall slit her throat . " <p> With a sigh , D'Roye jammed his sword point first into the ground beside the dead Lycanthrope . Then he stepped back , away from the blade , folding his arms . " I warn you , this will bring nothing but grief . " <p> " Perhaps , " Sergey admitted with a grin . " But you will not be there to see it . " Katya 's heart sank . Her knight would die- merely for showing mercy  --  and she would have to watch . Sergey stepped toward D'Roye , hefting his sword . <p> As he did , a black and amber body dropped on him from the branches above . Prince Sergey gasped as the leopard sank her fangs into his neck . Staggering beneath the weight of the leopard the Grand Duke dropped to his knees , then pitched forward onto his face . Katya watched in astonishment as the big cat continued to bite down on the Grand Duke , making sure he never got up . <p> D'Roye jerked his sword out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Let the girl go , if you want to live . " The arms holding her vanished , and she heard footfalls behind her as the horse archer took off into the forest . Her knight turned to Prince Sergey 's butler , who still held the Firebird 's Egg , a sick look on his horrified face . " Carefully set down that Egg , and you too may go . " <p> Placing the Egg gently on the ground , the butler backed slowly through the bracken , bumped into a tree , then turned and ran for his life . All that remained of Prince Sergey 's expedition into the Iron Wood was a trio of bodies , lying around the Firebird 's Egg . " Mon Dieu , " D'Roye muttered , " that went far better than I could ever have imagined . " <p> Slowly the leopard rose up , changing as she did , becoming a withered naked old woman with wrinkled skin and bone white hair . And not a single arrow mark on her . The Bone Witch smiled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you needed me . " <p> Her knight lowered his point and looked over at her . " This I suppose is your witch ? " <p> She hastened to introduce the Bone Witch to her knight , proud of the way he went down on one knee before the withered old woman , saying , " Madame Witch , Baron Roy d'Roye , at your service . " <p> " Is that just a gallantry , " asked the Witch , " or are you really at my service ? " <p> " Absolutely . Madame has saved my life , and I owe her anything that honor allows . " <p> " Good , " the Bone Witch declared , " I have need of your honor . " Then the Witch turned to her . " Come here , my daughter . " <p> She walked happily over , grateful to be free of Prince Sergey 's killers and glad to see the Witch alive  --  but utterly ecstatic to have someone finally call her " daughter . " <p> Giving her a wrinkled kiss , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now I have one last chore for you . " <p> " Whatever you wish . " For once she truly meant it . <p> " Return the Firebird 's Egg to its proper nest , so it may hatch and the curse on Markovy can be lifted . " <p> " But how will I get there ? " She felt surprised the Witch would give her a task so important , and so seemingly impossible . <p> " These will take you there . " The Witch snapped her bony fingers and a trio of horses ambled into the clearing  --  the knight 's war horse , a black mare with a horse archer 's bow and quiver hanging from her saddle , and a big bay palfrey laden with supplies . D'Roye 's eyes lit up , seeing the gray charger he had clearly given up for lost . <p> " I mean , how will I find the Nest ? " All Katya knew of the Firebird 's Nest was that it lay deep in the Iron Wood . <p> The Witch gave a low call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew down to land on it . Stroking the bird 's breast , the crone cooed , " You can take them there , can you not ? " Throwing back his head , the jay gave a confident raucous reply , flying over to land on the black mare 's saddle . " See , " the Witch told her , " he is more than ready . Are you ? " <p> Katya nodded solemnly , seeing that this is what the Witch had been training her for  --  how she would finally be " useful . " <p> When she had the Egg safely tucked into the palfrey 's pack saddle , Katya kissed the Bone Witch good-bye , and climbed onto the black mare . She watched her knight bow good-bye to the Witch , then mount his gray charger , grinning merrily . Her whole life led her to this point . As an orphan growing up , she invented royal parents and a magical future for herself . Just when puberty and poverty were about to lay waste her fantasies , she was given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now the rest was coming to pass  --  she had a horse beneath her , a charming knight at her side , and a quest ahead with the kingdom 's future at stake . She took her straw doll out of her dress , putting it in the black mare 's saddle bag . <p> Only one thing made her uneasy : her knight was a foreigner , not required to care if there was a curse on Markovy . And he was a real baron to boot , who did not need her royal dreams and extravagant lies . She asked softly and sincerely , " Are you sure you want to do this ? You are free to go your own way if you wish . " <p> " Heavens no , Mademoiselle . " He grinned happily . " Not when my lady has at long last landed me on the winning side . " <p> <p> By R.
