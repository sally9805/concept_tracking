<p> She 's got legs and knows how to use them . In a move worthy of an Olympic balance beam competitor , Julia Roberts thrusts a milelong gam on top of a table . <p> She boldly explains her towering presence in Hollywood . <p> " It 's the high heels , honey , " she says , flashing hot pink stilettos that make her a pretty gargantuan woman . <p> Then again , nothing about Roberts is small . <p> She has raked in a total of $ 2 billion at the box office by flashing that megawatt grin in megahits such as " My Best Friend 's Wedding " ( 1997 ) , " Notting Hill " ( 1999 ) and " Runaway Bride " ( 1999 ) . Last week Forbes named her " the most powerful celebrity on the planet " in its Celebrity 100 list . It 's no wonder . Roberts is the first woman to earn $ 20 million for a picture , which means she was paid a staggering $ 400,000 a day to star in " Erin Brockovich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might earn her a big prize next year : an Academy Award . <p> And speaking of living large , the girl from Smyrna , Ga. , now holds a poster for her new film in one hand . " It 's more cleavage than God ever thought to give me , " says Roberts , focusing hard on the gravity-defying dress . The feisty Southern gal has an analogy . " I think we should call this my ' Gypsies , Tramps and Thieves ' number . <p> " I mean , this is the real big deal , " Roberts says . <p> And now for the disclaimer : Beneath the overwhelming presence lurks a girl who still considers herself to be strictly small town . " I like to knit . I play a mean game of Yatzee . " And as for window dressing , she says , " I 'm more of a T-shirt , sweat pants and flip-flops girl . " <p> Her social life ? On a cold winter morning in New York City , she is more thrilled to meet a fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the suite next door . <p> " You 're from Smyrna ! " Roberts booms , her eyes popping . She leans in conspiratorially and the girl almost goes into heart palpitations . Julia Roberts has a question . <p> " Is there still an Eckerd 's drugstore in Smyrna ? " The girl nods . " Thank God ! " cries Roberts . " That 's the only reason I go home : Eckerd 's and my mother . I love that store ! " <p> Obviously , her outfit came from somewhere a bit more upscale . Roberts arrives in a modest purple sweater dress , a dozen cheap beaded bracelets and those major heels that will soon be up on the table . <p> Roberts is in an up mood . " She radiates like Audrey Hepburn , " says Danny DeVito , whose Jersey Films produced " Erin Brockovich , " the story of a brash , tough-talking , sexy single mom working in a law office . <p> Based on a real story , Roberts ' title character earns a $ 333 million settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Electric has contaminated the water in a town on the edge of the Mojave Desert . <p> It 's serious material made entertaining , with what critics are calling a " firecracker performance " from Roberts . <p> And Julia is in a firecracker mood these days . No " Erin go blah " here  --  DeVito says he never saw Roberts in a down mood on this set . " This is a girl who smiles and makes everyone feel happy . It 's like an infection of joy . " <p> Roberts is the first to admit that joy had taken a hiatus from her life for the last few years . On her way to superstardom , she got into a bit of a funk . After making her screen debut in 1988 's " Mystic Pizza , " Roberts was launched into mystical superstardom . It was n't an easy ride . <p> There was the smash hit " Pretty Woman " in 1990 . There were the high-profile , disastrous relationships with Kiefer Sutherland and Jason Patric , followed by an odd 22-month marriage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she says . Roberts even tumbled off the A list with several bombs , including " Mary Reilly " ( 1996 ) and " I Love Trouble " ( 1994 ) . <p> She became a rather sullen star . <p> " But these days I 'm holding firm , " she promises , not a trace of attitude in her voice . All you hear is steely determination . And she needs it . " Today I know I 'm going to have a bunch of ( reporters ) ask me dumb questions over and over again . But let 's go ! I think this one is actually going well . " <p> Now the warning : " I do n't respond anymore to two things , " Roberts says , dead serious . " Stupidity and disrespectfulness . " If you do neither , she 'll deliver on the promise , " I can be more myself if you 're nice . " <p> Roberts as herself is a pretty happy camper these days . <p> " I ca n't believe it , but I 'm feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her personal life is part of the reason . <p> Two years ago , Roberts met " Law &; Order " actor Benjamin Bratt in a New York restaurant . These days they can be seen holding hands at premieres of movies such as " The Next Best Thing " ( his ) , shopping around Manhattan to decorate an apartment ( hers ) or boogeying at a Marc Anthony concert . <p> Gossip scribes are expecting an engagement announcement within milliseconds . <p> Now Roberts is frowning . Ah , joy . So short-lived when it comes to discussing this stuff with reporters . " As for marriage , the media seems so impatient with me over this issue . It 's really no one 's business . But I will say that marriage and kids to me , well , that 's like real life , man . I like to leave that stuff to fate . " <p> Roberts ' career is the product of careful plotting . And at age 32 , it has come down to a pair of high heels , a tight-fitting dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seeped in my real life , " Roberts says , apologetically . " On the set , I was like , ' Can I have a - - - - - - - cup of cappuccino ? ' I 'm usually the one going , ' Does anybody need anything ? Sit . I 'll get it . ' " <p> Roberts is turning in what many call her best performance in " Erin Brockovich . " Director Steven Soderbergh says , " Julia was totally ready for this part . She reaches new dramatic depths that will shock people . " <p> Roberts also had to shed a few inhibitions to get to this point . " I have something in my closet that I call a dress , " Roberts says . " And Erin has something in her closet that I call a ' dre . ' You know , the whole part that covers your butt is not there . " <p> Roberts ' butt is on the line in several ways . <p> Can the queen of romantic comedies get serious on screen ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie is not a test , " she says , emphatically . " That 's not the point . Look , I just do the movies that are good . If they were all good romantic comedies , that 's all I 'd do . " <p> So far , she 's doing pretty well . " You can never deduce a good or bad movie down to one thing . Therefore , when a movie sucks , it 's not just me , " she says . <p> But lately , no one is using the " s " word . Even critics who used to pick apart every minute detail of Roberts ' life have let up on the Julia bashing . <p> " Now the press is n't choosing to ( dump ) on me , " she says . " What do you think is the difference between you ( the press ) choosing to ( dump ) on me or not ? " She looks defiantly at the reporter , " Back to you , hon. " <p> The message is clear . Do not underestimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , someone asked , what is the biggest misconception about Julia Roberts ? Now she provides the answer . " Um , that I 'm a bitch . That 's probably the biggest misconception . " <p> Why do people think she 's nasty ? <p> " Because I 'm tall and I 'm really smart . I 'm also very opinionated . I have lots of ideas and I 'm willing to share them , and I 'm also willing for someone to say , ' Hon , not your best idea , ' " Roberts says . " I think when you 're energetic and aggressive about things that it can be intimidating to people who are n't very smart themselves . " <p> Even smart men , like her new co-star Aaron Eckhart ( " The Company of Men " ) , admit to feeling a little queasy around Madame Box Office . " There is no question I felt nervous in her presence , " says Eckhart , who plays Roberts ' biker boyfriend in " Brockovich . " <p> " But I remember our first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this cute girl who was exceedingly polite and incredibly articulate . She is actually just a very nice girl , " he says . <p> And an incredibly powerful one . <p> Soderbergh , one of the hottest young directors in Hollywood , had to pass inspection , too . " Julia was already attached to this film , and essentially I was auditioning for her , " he says . " One day I met with her to explain how I thought the movie should work . She sat there and did n't say anything . " <p> A good sign ? A bad sign ? Would he ever work in Hollywood again ? <p> Soderbergh says , " I sent her all my drafts of the script , and she never sent any notes back . " In this case , no news was good news . He was hired . " On the set I found Julia to be the consummate professional . She was open to any new idea , " he says . <p> Right now she is open to some gossip . <p> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wants the reporter to read back the notes given earlier in the day from Eckhart and Soderbergh . Both of them claim ownership of the same exact quote . Both said , " Julia Roberts is hotter than the center of the earth . " <p> Roberts does n't care who said it . For all we know , they stole it from some grip . She seems downright giddy with joy . <p> " Oh goody . The boys are fighting over me ! " she cries . <p> Roberts ca n't fight fame . She seems almost resigned . <p> When she looks back at " Mystic Pizza , " does she see a different girl ? <p> " That girl weighed 20 pounds more and she knew about 50 things less , " Roberts says . One thing about that girl has n't changed . <p> " I 'm still properly motivated , " Roberts says . " The reason I do what I do has always been the same . I love to act . That part has always been really clear to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit easier . " <p> Right now is one of those challenging parts . Roberts has literally spent her young adult life under a microscope . The high intensity focus is n't fading . <p> Is the scrutiny worth it ? <p> " The good outweighs the bad , " Roberts says . For the first time , she says , the comments of others do n't sting as much . " Anyway , scrutiny is the comments of a stranger who is n't willing to say it to my face . So what do those words amount to in the grand scheme of things ? Not a lot . <p> " So would I trade being an actress for some privacy ? Would I be a dental hygienist and have nobody say a bad thing about me ? The answer is no , " Roberts says . Then again , most hygienists do n't get paid $ 20 mil a cleaning . <p> " The money does n't make me a better actor . It does n't make me work harder or less hard , " Roberts says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as when I got paid scale plus 10 percent . So you know , nothing changes because of what you get paid except what you get paid . And the fact that everybody wants to talk about what you get paid . <p> " Which , where I come from , is an inappropriate question to ask somebody , no offense . " <p> So what 's left to do when you have everything ? Roberts still has challenges . Such as cooking . <p> Bratt , who refers to Roberts as " my lady , " marvels at her ability to cook an entire Thanksgiving dinner . Without servants ! Yes , she 's domestic . Both Roberts and Bratt log time at their separate apartments here . Vacations are on the Southwest ranch ( hers ) . <p> They are enjoying some much-needed R &; R these days . She still might do the film " The Mexican " with Brad Pitt or take a small role in the remake of " Ocean 's 11 . " But it 's all up in the air . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read a good script and say , ' Break 's over , ' " Roberts says . <p> On the professional front , tongues wagged when Roberts wore a gold band to the Golden Globe Awards . She scoffs , " You know , those tongues belong to blind people , because I was wearing the same ring at the People 's Choice and the same ring last year at the Emmys . Somebody said to me , ' Oh , look at the ring . ' I was like , ' I 've been wearing this for years . ' " <p> Tossing that auburn hair , she cries , " Next ! " ' <p> Is an Oscar next ? <p> If " Erin " is on the ballot next year , would she vote for herself ? " Yeah ! Honey , you would vote for yourself . You see your name on that ballot and it 's an easy check mark . " <p> So is checking off the competition . Every single week , Hollywood does a poll of who will be " The Next Julia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone from Sandra Bullock to Reese Witherspoon . <p> As the reporter 's tape recorder stops , Roberts demonstrates how worried she is about the competition . <p> She flips the tape . " Wow , let 's tape over Reese Witherspoon now ! " she says , reading the label and pushing play . " Sorry , Reese . Old news , hon ! Loved ' Election . ' It 's over . " <p> For Roberts , it 's never over . There are more interviews . More photo ops . Big movies . Big money . At her heights , Roberts knows a fall would be steep . But today all she does is wobble a little bit . " Those damn heels , " she says , looking at her aching tootsies . <p> Distributed by Big Picture News Inc.
