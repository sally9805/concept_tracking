Chapter One A NIGHT OUT Harlem , New York . It was the summer of 1988 , and it was hot . Too hot . Harlem had to be the hottest place on the planet in the summertime . Exiting the West Riverside Drive on 125th Street , Gena was amazed to see so many people standing outside a nightclub . " Damn , look at that limousine , girl . We need to be with them ! " Laughing out loud , she was now suddenly anxious to get uptown . " We damn sure do , " said Sahirah , looking smug . It was amazing ; there was nothing like it : 125th was a mini Greek playland in the middle of Harlem . Gena had no understanding . It was n't like Philly . It was larger , and the niggas looked like Eric B and Rakim , with humongous gold chains and diamond medallions the size of bread plates . If it was meant to represent wealth , that shit did its job . And Gena liked it . She looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no clothes on . They were sexy and revealing , and Gena wanted to be among them , fucking with niggas , getting her life on . New York was the shit . There was no way she could live there , though . It was so fast , too fast . Fast niggas , fast cars , and fast lifestyles . The magnitude was large , as was the amount of men . Even the cars in New York looked different . Gena did n't know if it was the rims or the tires or what was going on . The dashboards were customized , leather MCM and Louis Vuitton seats , not tomention the detailed piping and thousand-dollar sound systems . That shit turned her the fuck on . Everything about New York turned her on , especially the guys . And to think , this was all so normal for them . Suddenly , Sahirah did an about-face and shouted , " No ! Look at that BMW . Is he the man of life or what ? " Riding by , there he was with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't contain herself . Leaning out the window , she called , " Hi ! " Turning back to Gena , she grabbed her arm . " Girl , do n't he look good ? " " Sahirah ! Bitch , is you crazy ? This is Harlem ! You just ca n't wave at these people up here ! " Gena tried to pull the top of her friend 's body back into the car . " Oh , shit , Gena . He 's pullin ' over . " " Yeah , but he 's all way on the opposite side of the street . " Against Gena 's protests , Sahirah made a U-turn into traffic , causing every moving vehicle to screech to a standstill just so she could meet the guy driving the BMW . She greeted them even as she double-parked just behind the Beemer , waving and calling to the driver . He stepped out of the car , fine as wine , and walked toward the girls . " What 's up ? " " What 's up ? " Sahirah repeated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking up on them . Getting out of the car , she replied , " I 'm Sahirah . What 's yours ? " " Rasun . " " I see you have Pennsylvania tags . You from Philly ? " Sahirah asked . " Yeah . Tell your girlfriend to get out of the car . " Gena insinuated herself out of the car and chimed , " I 'm Gena . " Rasun openly admired what he saw . " What 's up , Gena ? I 'm Rasun . That 's my homey Quadir in the car . Why do n't you go over there and talk to him ? " " What does he look like ? " Smiling , he told her , " Go and see . " How convenient , she thought , Sahirah got the driver , and I got the passenger . When she reached the other car , she announced , " Hi . I 'm Gena . Your friend Rasun told me I should come over here and talk to you . " Quadir studied Gena as though he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Quadir . " After another minute , he thought he should say something and stop staring . " So . Do you live in New York ? " " No . I live in Philly . What about you ? " " I live in North Philly . " " Oh . I live out West . " " What are you doing up here ? " Gena thought quickly how to cover her and Sahirah 's man-hunting designs on this side of the Lincoln Tunnel . " Well , my aunt is sick , and I just came up here to spend the day with her . " It 's just a little white lie , she told herself . It ca n't hurt . " What about you ? " " Business , had to take care of some business , " he told her , thinking about the kilos of cocaine in his trunk . " What 's a pretty girl like you doing out here in this big city all alone ? " " I 'm not alone . " Gena 's head was reeling from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her body sported a blush . " I 'm with my girlfriend , Sahirah . " " Oh , " he said , looking at Sahirah as if to say , ' How the hell will she save you ? ' Shifting back to reality , remembering the kilos of cocaine in the trunk of the Beemer , he said , " We got to go , but I want to see you tomorrow . Will you be in Philly tomorrow ? " " Yes . Wan na switch numbers ? " " Most definitely . " She said good-bye to Quadir and pocketed his number . Even though he was n't driving , he was nice and he was dark-skinned , and that was definitely a plus . Not to mention the diamond bezel Rolex watch he had on . Damn , she thought , the man is dark as night , but his beard and his moustache was so sexy . She would definitely be trying to see him tomorrow , which for her was a lifetime away . Gena and Sahirah partied hard and met many guys that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning up in her thoughts . Before Gena got on the Turnpike , she went uptown to 145th Street to get a Willie burger . She loved Willie burgers . Nothing could fuck with them in the middle of the night . No lie , like 125th Street , the saga continued ; mad money niggas were everywhere . She got some gas from the station down the street and was ready to make her journey back home . Crossing the George Washington Bridge , she could n't help but look over at New York City 's skyline . New York was the most happening town she knew of . She always hated leaving . Finally reaching Exit 6 Gena thought , Home sweet home . It was about 5:30 AM when they reached Sahirah 's mother 's house . Gena parked the rental car and looked at her best friend and the slobber and spit dribbling out of her mouth . " Sahirah , wake up . We 're home . " She nudged her leg and called her to wake up after she parked the car . Sahirah was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get her back to life . Another few minutes of calling out to her friend and Sahirah finally wiped her mouth and opened her eyes . " Come on , let 's go . I 'm tired . You 've been sleeping . I have n't . " " Oh , did you see the EPMD guy , Erick ? " " How could I have missed him ? He almost hit your simple ass when you jumped in front of his Benz ! You really have some serious issues to deal with . " " Do n't even try it . You got nerve . You 're jealous ' cause I got Kendu 's number . Do n't be mad . Besides , I saw you talking to what 's his name ? Quadir . Yeah , him . " Sahirah talked as if Gena had behaved as poorly as she did . " What about this guy ? Look at our picture . Now tell me he is n't all that . I could have sucked his dick right out there on 125th Street . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will , " stated Gena with more sarcasm as she shook her head . " And that motherfucker in the Range Rover ? If it was n't for you , I would have really got my young life on . " " I just know you would have . " " Well , what did you think of him ? " Sahirah insisted . " Do you think he was cute , or what ? " " Sahirah ! Think the fuck of who ? I do n't know who you are talking about . " Sahirah paid her no mind . Once they were inside the house , Sahirah started counting the telephone numbers , which she had collected over the course of the evening . " Seven numbers ! " she hollered . Gena could n't help but to look at her friend in disbelief . " I 'm going to sleep . " Gena and Sahirah had been friends since they were five years old . Both grew up down in Richard Allen , the projects niggas would n't go to if they was n't from there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to West Philly on 54th and Race Street . Even though they did n't go to school together after Sahirah moved , she and Gena always kept in touch . When Gena turned seventeen , her Uncle Michael got her an apartment on Chancellor Street . He paid all her bills . No one in her family knew . Gena had pleaded with her uncle for years to move her out of the projects . He had really been there for her , and whenever she wanted something , he would help her . He kept her in a rental car and gave her money whenever she asked for it . She was fortunate to have someone in her family who made it and could show her the way . She knew plenty of people her age who had no one they could turn to in time of need . That was one thing Gena could say for herself . Even though she was raised in the projects , she had family who believed in taking care of the kids . Some people did n't have family like that , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuck one way or the other . Do what you gon na do , ' cause you gon na fuck something up anyway . That was the attitude . Half of Gena 's friends had parents who said , " Hey , we got a party to go to , " and that 's where they were , at the party partying . Or if they were n't at the party , they were too busy getting high . Then you had the motherfuckers sitting right there in the house not giving a damn whether the kids were in the house , in the street , hungry or safe . A whole generation sat back , and said , " Fuck it . I 'm not gon na raise my kids . " Hence , the saga began . Shit was rough as hell in Philly . That 's why Gena liked her little trips to other cities . Gena and Sahirah had done their share of city hopping , too . Seeing that there was other people out there , not just West Philly or the projects , was positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltimore and met niggas with boats . They went to D.C. , liked the guys but could n't take the go-go scene . They traveled to Atlanta and met brothers with pets . From Miami to New York , they were there . They constantly received flyers for out-of-town parties in the mail . Life was just one big party . Gena was into the party scene . The same faces , the same places , and the same circles . When the Junior Mafia began spreading cocaine throughout the city , money was flowing like water from a faucet , and niggas were givin ' it up as if it were leaves on trees . Gena 's whole entourage of male companions were young , handsome , and very wealthy drug dealers . Hustlers who loved to come on a set and just break a nigga off . It was too good to be true , and do n't talk about sex . You were definitely getting broke down for dropping down , was n't no questions asked . Gena and Sahirah dropped down , way down , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the sisters their props was if they were n't getting paper . Thoroughbreds of the streets , getting money was what it was all about , and any way you could get it , you was supposed to . Across town on a little side street , sat a burgundy Cadillac . The driver was eagerly and carefully aware of the sound of the street . He had been sitting in the car for three hours waiting in anticipation . The movement of a tree branch blowing in the wind grasped his attention . He turned back to the gray screen door across the street ; 3601 , he thought to himself . Deciding that would be a good number to play , he reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out a small bag of cocaine . He dumped a tiny pile between his thumb and his pointer finger and held his hand up to his nose . After he fed his nostrils , he took his tongue and licked his hand clean . On the seat beside him laid an Uzi semiautomatic . He picked up the gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in already knowing it was loaded . The gray screen door flew open and four guys emerged . They hopped into an MPV , never noticing the burgundy Cadillac following them . The next morning , Gena woke up to the sound of Sahirah 's four brothers and sisters acting like they were out of their minds . " What time is it ? " she asked as Mrs. Bowden walked by the doorway . " Oh , good morning , Gena . It 's nine thirty , baby . You want some breakfast ? " Hell no , thought Gena . I want some sleep . " No , ma'am , " she replied . " I have to go . Tell Sahirah to call me . " Gena was out of there with the quickness . On the way to her house , she stopped to get her favorite pancakes . At the intercom , she hollered , " No pork ! Do not put pork anywhere near my food . Do you understand ? No pork . I do n't want to see it . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to say but did n't . Gena gave her the money and waited for her food and change . A burgundy Cadillac with black tinted windows sped across the parking lot . All of a sudden and out of nowhere , thunderous gunfire jolted Gena out of her reverie and continued to echo through her body . The bullets sent a screeching sound through her body as the gunman met his target aimed for the four guys in the MPV . Gena 's mind yelled run , duck down , hide , get the fuck away , settling on none until her survival instincts took her through the natural progression of ducking down and getting her ass out of there . She sped away from the takeout window and tried to exit from the parking lot when the burgundy Cadillac Sedan Deville with gold trim , tinted windows , and spoked rims cut her off . She slammed on the brakes and missed hitting the driver 's door panel by inches . For one long moment , she looked right at the driver . He had an Uzi semiautomatic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steering wheel . In that one moment , he looked at her , and their eyes locked . Gena knew him from somewhere , but did not remember from where . Wondering whether she should say hi , she just sat still as a stop sign and stared at him . Wondering if he should drop her ass too , he pointed the Uzi straight at her head and pulled the trigger . Nothing happened . He tried the shit again . The clip was empty . The thought went through him , Yeah , dis is her lucky day . He threw the gun on the floor of the caddy and sped away . Gena sat there shaken and confused . She 'd never had a gun pointed at her before . She just knew her beauty saved her . Little did the simpleton know , she had almost become a statistic . Her heart was pounding like drops of hail on a windowpane . Talking her hands into obedience , she wrapped her shaky fingers about the steering wheel and instructed her right foot to come back to life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exit . She carefully looked both ways before entering onto Fifty-second Street . She drove in silence , creeping down the street , not even listening to the radio . She could n't believe what had just happened , and she kept checking the rearview mirror to see if anyone was behind her . Man , her mind was playing tricks on her . The burgundy Cadillac was so clear in her mind and the license plate tag , Mafia-23 , was even clearer . Reaching her favorite parking spot between the two trees in front of her door , she noticed Jamal's-her boyfriend-Pathfinder parked down the street . She looked close and could n't believe it . Jamal was sleeping in his jeep outside her door ! She walked over to the jeep and knocked on the glass window . Jamal jumped out of what looked like a very uncomfortable sleeping position . " Where the fuck you been ? " Gena just looked at him , as if she did n't know what he was talking about . " I spent the night over Sahirah 's , Jamal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matching hat and shovel ? " Climbing out of the jeep , he continued , " I thought I told you I did n't want you hanging around her ! " " I know what you told me , Jamal , but this is a free country and I can do what I ... " The words were lost as her body made its way to the pavement with the force of Jamal 's backhand . Then he picked her up and began his accusations . " I know you been with another man , bitch . Ai n't no way you was sleeping with Sahirah unless you and Sahirah is fucking each other . Shit , I been out this motherfucker all night , waiting for you ! " The tears had already begun . " I was n't with nobody . " " You 're a motherfucking liar ! Why you got to lie ? " The question was stressed with another pop upside her head , causing her to spin around and fall into some bushes . Deciding it was best to remain in contact with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't doin ' nothing . " She looked up and saw Ms. Gladys looking out her third floor window , watching everything . Rising to face him , she said , " Jamal , I 'm sorry . I wo n't go out with her anymore . " " Where the fuck did you go ? " " I did n't go nowhere . " Slap was the sound that could be heard as he hit her again . " Gena , do n't make me kill you out this motherfucker . Where you been ? I said where the fuck you been all night long ? " Too scared to say she had gone to a party in Harlem , she just looked at him . " I 'm getting tired of your shit . " " Jamal , I do n't want to fight with you . I 'm hungry , and I 'm tired . " " That 's because your trick ass was out in the street all night . " The accusations gathered storm clouds to her eyes . " I 'm not no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , she realized at that moment any feeling she had for him was gone and she was ready to kick him in his nuts and run for safety , as usual . The nigga was crazy ; it was in his eyes . If he walked away and she never saw him again , it would make no difference to her .
