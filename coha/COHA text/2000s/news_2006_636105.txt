<p> MIDWEEK MUSINGS <p> CLUELESS CUBS NOW WIRELESS AS WELL <p> Welcome to the 21st century . The Cubs have wireless communications between the dugout and the bullpen at Wrigley Field . One of the few times there will be a Tribune Co. enterprise involving the ballclub with no strings attached . <p> - Given the way the season has unfolded for the Cubs , the team 's higher-ups might want to make sure manager Dusty Baker 's direct link to the bullpen also can dial 911 . <p> - Before the Carlos Marmol bandwagon becomes overloaded , a word of caution , courtesy of Sun-Times colleague Mark Potash . He notes Marmol and Greg Maddux indeed share the distinction of beating the Cincinnati Reds in their big-league starting debuts . But wait ! So does Jeff Pico , who tossed a four-hit shutout against them in 1988 , thereby giving Cubs fans hope they had filled the void in the rotation left by Al Nipper . That would be the same Jeff Pico who allowed 14 runs in his next 21 innings and was out of baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 teams to take a 2-0 NBA Finals lead go on to win the series , maybe it 's time to rethink the 2-3-2 format ( such as a 2-2-1-1-1 format for a more equitable system ) .

" <p> Not to be confused with the England team that squeaked past Paraguay 1-0 . <p> Even the German media took note with newspaper Bild calling David Beckham 's sister Joanne fat " and saying his mother , Sandra , had the smile of a peasant . Presumably that 's not a compliment . <p> How dare the Germans attack Beck 's birds ? " London 's Sun retorted . <p> Having the WAGS in Baden-Baden is goodie-goodie for business . <p> The WAGS reportedly spent part of Monday at boutiques and spent close to $10,000 on some sunglasses , shoes and clothes . <p> Which is n't so bad , considering the rooms at the hotel where they are staying go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women reportedly spent Monday night on liquid refreshments at a restaurant . <p> We have President Clinton here and Bono , but I do n't think they made as big a stir as these girls , " shop owner Monica Scholz told the Daily Mirror .
