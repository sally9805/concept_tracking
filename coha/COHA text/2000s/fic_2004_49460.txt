I grew up on Eighteenth Street and Throop , in the heart of Chicago . To the east , beyond the Dan Ryan Expressway , beyond the steeple of Providence of God church , and beyond the noman 's land that was the " darkside , " a stretch of neighborhood laced with forgotten Illinois-Continental railroad tracks and collapsing smokestacks , a place said to be inhabited by the most ruthless Mexican street gang in Chicago , the Villa Lobos , was the lake . To the north were the Puerto Ricans , who were rumored to surpass the Villa Lobos in ruthlessness , said to be willing to shoot you in front of a church or in front of family , sins the Mexican gangs swore against . And then beyond them , farther north , were the whites , in a dreamland accessible only by the Chicago El , and even at that , something you glimpsed momentarily-red brick houses , wrought-iron fences , tree-lined streets-then left , swallowed by the subway if you were on the Douglas-Park B , or forced to watch the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blacks were to the south . They were unfathomables . Things we did n't understand went on down there . Killings were indiscriminate . And to the west was the sunset , and that 's all I ever knew about the west , when evening would come and the sun would hit that point at the horizon where it flared up the long , neon , glass corridor of Eighteenth Street as if each panaderia , taco joint , and tavern had caught fire . Then , minutes later , the miracle would disappear , and up and down Eighteenth Street the kids who had lined up for blocks were left to wonder if the sun 's sole purpose was to torture them with a paradise they would never get to . <p> We called this the Revelation . We 'd named the event as kids , when Rogelio Ramirez , who grew up with the rest of us on Throop Street , began reading the Bible and reciting from the Book of Revelations as the sun set . He 'd stand on the corner stoop of Trebol 's tavern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points in the air with his right . " The Woman and the Dragon ! " Rogelio would say . " The Fall of Babylon ! " Occasionally , the men going into the tavern would stop and listen , as if contemplating the passages Rogelio read , but something in them always snapped , and they 'd break into laughter and call Rogelio " The Pope " or " The Saint of Throop Street . " Rogelio would never care . He 'd simply raise his voice even higher , bring his arm down even harder . Eventually , the men would retreat into the smoky darkness that was Trebol 's tavern . The thick , black door sweeping shut behind them . The small diamond of mirrored glass at its center staring down at us as if a horde of curious drunks were peering out from behind it . When the sun would drop below the horizon , Rogelio would snap his Bible shut , turn on his heels , and march back down Throop Street , like a leader into flames , towards the apartment buildings we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade , Rogelio 's mother began sleeping with Rowdy , an old Racine-Boy who lived above Sergio and Jorge Naverette , two brothers in our group and expert spies who had devised an ingenious method by which to hear the sex going on above them . <p> " Check it out , bro , " Sergio said the morning after he revealed the secret to me . He turned and began walking up his apartment building 's stairs . That morning I had met him early for school , looking to hear Ms. Ramirez 's lovemaking for myself . <p> Sergio stepped into his living room , past his kitchen whose boiling pots of water always made that side of the house seem more like a rainforest than a place where people lived and ate . He led me around the corner into the small bedroom he shared with his brother . There on the bed , lying on his side , was Jorge , holding a long row of paper-towel rolls taped end-to-end to his ear , the other end inserted through a hole for a missing light fixture in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let Javier see . " Jorge 's eyes were closed , his eyebrows raised in soft arches . He was a year younger than Sergio or me , ten at the time , but with his head to the side , his eyes closed the way they were , he seemed even younger , like the Christmas ornaments my mother had of baby angels sleeping . <p> " Jorge , " Sergio said again . And Jorge opened his eyes but made no move to get up . Instead , he continued with the cardboard contraption , alternating his gaze between our faces as if what he saw was beyond us , beyond the walls of the tiny bedroom he and his brother shared . <p> " Jorge ! " Sergio said again . And Jorge snapped from whatever spell he was under . He leapt from the bed . " Damn , bro ! " he said . " They 're doing it doggie-style ! " he sounded out of breath , excited . I took the tube and nodded , knowing from Penthouses Sergio and Jorge kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On the other side of the small apartment , amidst the cloud of humidity I had seen swirling when I passed , were Sergio and Jorge 's parents . Though I lived just across the street , I had only really seen Sergio and Jorge 's parents twice in my life , once at our confirmation , at our grammar school , Providence of God , and once when their apartment building had been set on fire , the actions of a disgruntled former tenant . Otherwise their parents hardly seemed to exist at all , disappearing into doorways , driving off in their green pickup , always slipping just out of view . Whenever I walked into Sergio and Jorge 's apartment and saw the swirling steam of their kitchen , I wondered if their parents were actually in there , or if they hid from their children the way they seemed to hide from everyone else . <p> Love affairs were a fact of life in my neighborhood . What Ms. Ramirez was doing was not that extraordinary . Mr. Gomez , downstairs in my building , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everyone knew about it , knew Mrs. Gomez knew about it , when she would send her youngest son , Peter , to fetch his father from the barmaid 's apartment atop the tavern . But no one ever said anything , as if in sympathy for Mrs. Gomez . As well , stories abounded of mothers who had left their families to live with truck drivers from Texas or journeyman housepainters . <p> But Ms. Ramirez was religious . Her husband had left her the year before , and she had turned to the church , Rogelio in tow . When the Virgin Mary processions came singing up the street , carting the porcelain three-foot statue of La Virgen to the sinafflicted apartments of the neighborhood , Ms. Ramirez was in the lead . She had inherited from the most devout before her the task of deciding how long the Virgin was to sit in the various accursed households , sometimes for weeks on end . And behind her , carrying the candles and crucifixes of the procession , the fifteen or so other neighborhood women followed like apostles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unwed daughters to pregnancies and flight-of-fancy elopements , but Ms. Ramirez had lost a husband , and though the list of " things to weather " went on for miles in my neighborhood , deserting husbands crowned the list . <p> " All right , " Jorge instructed . " Now push it up till you hit the floor . " I raised my head as Jorge worked the other end of the tube deeper into the hole . Sprinkles of dry plaster cascaded upon the side of my face , into my eye , as I held the tube to my ear . Abruptly the tube hit flush . Sergio and Jorge looked to me . I was n't sure what to listen for . What did doggie-style sound like ? Then , without warning , the unmistakable sounds of sex began pouring down the tube . I heard the squeak of old bedsprings . I heard the scrape of bedposts against wood flooring . Most remarkable of all , I heard the voice of Rogelio 's mother , who just the day before had asked me how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rowdy , " softly , quietly , as if sorry for something , grateful for something else . <p> I looked to Sergio . <p> " I told you , bro ! " he said . " I told you she was up there ! " I did n't say a word . Instead , I listened more closely , able now to pick up even fainter sounds , the rocking of an off-kilter night table , the groans of Rowdy himself , whose voice here was smooth and easy , different from when he was out front drinking , cursing in ways we remembered and used on our own . <p> I could n't tell they were doing it doggie-style or any style . I only pictured in motion the Penthouse scenes Sergio had begun flashing before me like cue cards . I closed my eyes . <p> The heaves of Rogelio 's mother began closing in on each other . The groans of Rowdy got louder . I pictured Ms. Ramirez sweating , her mouth open , her tongue pushed against her upper teeth like the women in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in the red heels she often wore to work , her shoes glowing , radiating as if with heat in the steam-filled room I imagined . <p> " Ohh , " Ms. Ramirez suddenly gasped . I opened my eyes . <p> " Let me see ! " Sergio said . I did n't respond . Sergio put his magazine on the dresser and sat next to me . He placed his ear close to mine at the end of the tube . On my right side , Jorge did the same , a triangle of eavesdroppers . <p> " All right , " Sergio said . " He 's about to come . " <p> And then there was a quick trade of punches . Ms. Ramirez called out to God ; Rowdy grunted ; the rocking turned to a rumble , the scrapes to digs , and then there was a yell , and in that split-second Rowdy 's voice was thick and heavy , the way it sounded out front when he called someone a punk-ass motherfucker and was about to prove it . Silence followed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listening for any aftermath . Sergio rose from the bed and bowed like a matador to the four corners of the tiny bedroom . Jorge whistled softly in applause . <p> " Man , " Sergio said as we walked to the corner of Eighteenth and Throop , our notebooks in hand , " they were all over today . Usually they 're just quiet . " <p> " Must 've been horny , " I said . " She always yell for God like that ? " <p> " All the time , " Sergio said . " She 's going to hell . " He blessed himself and laughed . <p> At the corner Jorge took a seat on Trebol 's stoop as Sergio and I looked up the block for Rogelio and Marcitos . Up and down Eighteenth Street , the morning delivery trucks worked their horns to announce their backing into docks . The early mist had not yet burned off the neighborhood . The smell of yesterday 's fried food , tacos , gorditas , chicharron , hung in the air . Soon the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's worth of fried-food smell to settle over the neighborhood . Up the block , Rogelio and Marcitos came out of their buildings . Marcitos , carrying a single spiral notebook like the rest of us . Rogelio , carrying his books and Bible in a small brown briefcase . Marcitos crossed Throop and met Rogelio , then approached us . <p> Providence , our grammar school , was marooned on the dark-side , forgotten among abandoned factories , outmoded railroad lines , and dilapidated wood-framed houses . I 'm sure those in the neighborhood who did n't know Providence of God was back there-it was small , like any other three-flat-wondered every morning where all the kids were going , disappearing into the maze of decaying brick buildings , following the train tracks as if we were ghosts of a life that might have existed there once , when the heart of the textile industry was still in the city , not in the suburbs or wherever it disappeared to . We even felt like ghosts sometimes , in the winter , when the old ladies would stare at us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which of us might be tastiest ( child-eating witches were said to live among these lopsided homes ) . In the spring , when it rained , we huddled beneath the train docks and examined the vast innards of the factories , the huge chutes that hung like descending missile silos , the conveyors that led off into distances we never had guts enough to explore . When the rain stopped , we crossed back over the railroad lines and became real again , our walks like transformations . <p> " Hey , bro , " Sergio said as Rogelio passed us , assuming his usual position at the head of the pack . " Your mom leave for work early this morning ? " <p> I cringed . <p> " She goes to work early now , " Rogelio said , not turning around to look , his briefcase bouncing off his skinny leg . " I told you last week . " Behind us Jorge and Marcitos , who were the same age , settled into their morning discussion about the previous day 's episode of Specter Man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Jorge 's duty to update him on anything he might have missed . <p> His blood is blue , bro . Everyone knows that . <p> For real , damn , I thought I saw some orange coming through . <p> Sergio stroked his chin . <p> " She must like working , huh ? " he asked . Sergio elbowed me in the arm . The sounds and images of earlier that morning came to mind . Rogelio did n't answer . <p> We neared St. Precopius , our school 's competing parish . Morning sunlight exploded as if from within the church , casting the reds and blues of the stained-glass windows onto the sidewalk below . As Rogelio passed the front doors , he blessed himself , forming a cross with his thumb and forefinger and tracing miniature crucifixes at his forehead , mouth , and chest . He kissed his thumb to heaven . In imitation we all did the same . <p> " Hey , " Sergio said . " How about if your mother was seeing some other guy ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She 's got the Lord . " He raised a finger to heaven . <p> " I know , I know , " Sergio said . " Everyone 's got the Lord , but say you found out she was with some other guy . Maybe you came home and found her on the floor , maybe in bed- " Sergio was looking to the sky , imagining scenarios , sexual positions . He did n't see Rogelio whirl around , his briefcase flare out at his side . <p> " Do n't talk about my mother ! " Rogelio said . He pointed a finger in Sergio 's face . " Do n't talk about things you do n't know about . " Rogelio was much shorter and skinnier than Sergio , but he held his finger right off the tip of Sergio 's nose . Sergio did n't move . Rogelio turned and began walking again . <p> " Damn , cuz , " Sergio called out after Rogelio . " Do n't worry about me . I know what I 'm talking about . " Rogelio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . He blessed himself , held up a cross of forefingers , then marched forward . <p> We turned down Sangamon Street . Sets of railroad tracks , the dividing line between the darkside and the realside , ran down the center . More kids had begun filling in our side of the sidewalk , all of us waiting until we got to Eighteenth Place , the street our school was on , to cross over . Our school bully , Gustavo Rivera , a large kid with sweat glands that poured like waterfalls , walked our side as well , torturing smaller kids with " the wedge , " what he called his **34;1564;TOOLONG move where he crushed tiny first-grader heads between his chunky hands . <p> Across the tracks , only Pepe Ordonez , Paco Martinez , and Jeremy Witek walked the darkside . We called them the " lost-boys . " They had been walking the darkside for as long as anyone could remember , breaking factory windows , smoking , spray-painting unfamiliar gang signs on the crumbling railroad docks . Rumor had it they were orphans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like animals , like the Villa Lobos , who for some reason , maybe respect , never seemed to mind the lost-boys on their territory . The lost-boys were eighth-graders . They had been held back two years or more and were actually old enough to be in high school . <p> " I heard Paco and Pepe were in the Audey Home for stealing cars , " Marcitos said from behind us . " That they got butt-raped in there , and that 's why they went crazy . " <p> " Who told you that ? " Sergio asked . <p> " Mona Colon , downstairs , " Marcitos said . He was referring to a high-school girl who lived beneath him , one who we collectively lusted after because at her age she did n't seem that far out of reach . Paco was said to have gone out with Mona . Some even said that he had had sex with her . And at the time this seemed to have something to do with his ability to walk the darkside . We figured Jeremy and Pepe had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other high-school girls who stood on the corners smoking cigarettes , wearing tight black pants , thick black eyeliner , and purple lipstick . The older we got , the more we wanted to be with them , have them hanging off our shoulders the way girlfriends in our neighborhood did . French-kissing them among the collapsed rafters of the burnt-out factories we had always been so afraid of . <p> The three lost-boys mounted an abandoned train-dock and climbed through a half-fallen brick wall into one of the factories . Up and down Sangamon Street , the kids of Providence looked on in wonder , except for Rogelio , who walked with tunnel vision a half block ahead of us , and Gustavo Rivera , who reached for the head of another unsuspecting first-grader . <p> At Eighteenth Place , we crossed over the tracks , walked one more block in total silence , then went our separate ways , Marcitos and Jorge to their fifth-grade classroom , Sergio and me to the sixth , and Rogelio to the sacristy of Providence of God church , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There had been a time before the Revelation readings , before Ms. Ramirez led processions , before the briefcase , when Rogelio was one of us . Back then his father was still around , and on our way home from school we would see him on the corner sometimes talking with his partners . Rogelio would run up to him like a good son , and his father would pick him up and whirl him around like a good father . Then he 'd give Rogelio money , and we 'd cross the street to Paul 's Drug Store , where we 'd buy Slim Jims and Cokes , which we then consumed on the broken concrete steps of the Dvorak Park public pool , pretending we were rich , smoking thin cigars , downing dark champagne . <p> We only ever knew his father from these scenes and the few things Rogelio had told us , how his father was rich , owned oil wells in Texas , had stock in Shell Oil . We all lied about our families . Sergio said his father was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had houses in California , that we could see the Hollywood sign from our backyards , some with better views than others . After hearing Rogelio 's lie , Sergio began telling kids at school that his father had stock in Shell Oil . In the courtyard , when the girls asked me or Rogelio if what Sergio said was true , we always said it was , that all three of our fathers had stock in Shell Oil , that our families were part-owners and that we all split profits . When asked why we were n't living in the mansions we claimed to have , we pounded our chests the way the gangbangers did and claimed it was the neighborhood . That we had family here , even the people we did n't like . And those listening always nodded in understanding . <p> Those days were full of talk . Talk about our favorite team , the Chicago White Sox , and the hated Chicago Cubs . Talk about where we wanted to visit when we got older , Alaska , Yellowstone Park , places we had researched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were guarded by our school 's secretary , Ms. Margaret , in the main office . We talked about running away . Rogelio had mentioned his aunt who lived in Aurora . Aurora sounded like a nice place , and I told Rogelio if he wanted to go that I would go with him . Sergio laughed at us for thinking we would ever run away , and when we thought about it more , we knew he was right , and became embarrassed for thinking so childishly . <p> But those days changed after his father left . In the beginning it was just the Revelation readings , which were fun because for a while we thought Rogelio was joking , the way he wrinkled his brow , the way he moved his arm stiff and strong . But then Rogelio started not being home , started going to church even on Saturdays , our baseball days , our football days . He had become an altar boy and had to stay after school for practice . In the mornings he stopped going straight to class and instead showed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning praying back in the sacristy . And finally , when we did talk to him , Rogelio talked about things we did n't care about , religious things : You know that Brother Adam went to Providence when it was all Polish ? Little by little Rogelio became someone else , someone we did n't know except for what we remembered . We continued listening to Rogelio 's mother . I showed up at my usual time two days later and found Marcitos there . Sergio had obviously passed word . We divided up the half-hour between the four of us , Jorge keeping time on his father 's silver watch . At one point , Ms. Ramirez said , " I love you . " Marcitos was listening . <p> " She just said ' I-love-you , ' " Marcitos said , inflecting the couples ' rhythm . <p> " Let-me-hear , " Sergio said . And they talked like that the rest of the morning . Even to Rogelio , who had become remarkably more distant in the past few days , walking even farther ahead of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sergio asked as we walked to school . <p> Rogelio said nothing . <p> " Hey , " I called out to Rogelio . " Remember they used to call you the Pope ? Remember we were going to run away ? " <p> Rogelio did n't answer . When he passed the doors of St. Precopius , he blessed himself . In routine , though we were a full city block behind him , we all did the same . <p> A week later I showed up at Sergio and Jorge 's building and found the front door open . Upstairs , their apartment door was open as well . I stepped in and tiptoed through the creaky living room , past the dripping kitchen . I opened the door to Sergio and Jorge 's room and saw the usuals , Jorge with the watch , Marcitos sitting on the bed , and Sergio with his stack of magazines . But there were three new kids there as well , one with the tube , now bent and velvety , to his ear , and the others on either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I recognized one of the new kids from Morgan Street , a side street we often used on our way home from school . I had n't seen him since months before , but his face , especially his eyebrows , which were upturned in a perpetual scowl , had stuck with me as a mark of a person to avoid . <p> Sergio continued turning pages . " This is Carlos , " he whispered to me , nodding towards the kid with the tube . " And Joseph and Tony . " He took a breath . " I think I 'm going to start charging . " He whispered this even quieter . He smiled and gave me a nod like I should agree with him . <p> " Javier , " I said , introducing myself to Joseph and Tony . I skipped over the kid with the tube . Tony , the kid I remembered , pounded his fist to his chest two times as I shook his hand . It was Amor , insider gangbanger stuff , done to represent a Nation . Rowdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . He was an old Racine-Boy . But Tony did it obviously because he was a Morgan-Boy , or if he was n't , an older brother was . <p> " Are they doing it doggie-style ? " I asked Carlos , tapping him on his shoulder as I stepped by . <p> Carlos opened his eyes , his head still sideways . " How should I know ? " he said . And those in the room began laughing , Sergio and Jorge included . <p> We took turns . Two minutes each . Jorge keeping track on his father 's Timex . <p> We went through the order , and the tube finally came to me . Ms. Ramirez and Rowdy were talking . I was trying to pick up their whispers , searching for the words I thought people in love might say-love , babies , marriage-but in the crowded bedroom concentration was difficult . I breathed , put my hand over my open ear , closed my eyes . Still , I heard only the heavy rush of silence , and an occasional echo too distorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " somebody cried in Sergio 's gangway . " Dios mio ! " A door slammed . The sound of footsteps could be heard between buildings . Sergio stepped to the side window , saving with a finger his place in the Penthouse he was working on . I handed the tube to Tony and went to the window as well . Jorge and Marcitos followed . <p> Mrs. Gonzalez , the woman who lived in the ground-floor apartment , was running up the narrow gangway , yelling that the Virgin had flown away . She turned the corner onto the sidewalk , and the three of us shuffled around the end of the bed to the front window . When we arrived , Mrs. Gonzalez 's blue shawl was fluttering out of range . We turned for the living room , where two more windows looked upon the street . Sergio flung his Penthouse onto the bed . Carlos , Joseph , and Tony continued with the tube . <p> As we rushed through the bedroom door , Sergio suddenly stopped in his tracks , and we stacked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder and , behind me , Jorge 's chin into my shoulder . Standing in the sun , at the living-room windows , were Sergio and Jorge 's parents . I looked upon them for the first time ever up close . At our confirmation , and the time their building had been set on fire , their father had worn a baseball cap . Here , he wore nothing , and I could see that he was not only bald down the center of his head but that his scalp glowed a bright scarlet like he had some kind of infection . His belly bulged within an old cowboy shirt , and his arms seemed longer than they should 've been : his wrists were visible beyond his shirt cuffs . Their mother stepped closer to us , taking tiny steps , and it occurred to me suddenly that the mother and father were complete opposites . While the father was lanky and bulbous around the waist , the mother was short and compact , muscular-looking in the thick brown sweater she wore . She had a full head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight braid like something you might see on a young girl . <p> " Que estan haciendo ? " their mother asked . When she opened her mouth , silver crowns on her bottom row of teeth caught light . She looked past us through the doorway and into the bedroom . Tony and Joseph still had their ears to the tube . Carlos had his eyes on the watch . Sergio 's magazine was strewn across the bed , its wrinkled and worn centerfold opened up and in clear view . <p> Her backhand rose like a reflex . It was so fast I only felt its breeze as it whizzed past my nose and cracked Sergio square across the left side of his face . Sergio reeled back , bringing up his hands to shield himself . I stepped aside , and his mother landed two more smacks , more dense-sounding , to the back of Sergio 's head . <p> She whirled around , her stiff braid unmoving . " Salganse de mi casa " she screamed at the three on the bed . Carlos , Joseph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedged in the ceiling , leaving the silver watch lying on the bed . As they passed through the bedroom door , they brushed up against the door-jamb , eying the trigger hand of Sergio 's mother . <p> She turned to me and Marcitos and pointed her short wrinkled finger in our faces . She told us she was going to have a long talk with our mothers , then stared at us with her flared up eyes like miniature Revelations . " Sacanse de aqui , " she said to us , and we followed her finger , which she had turned towards the front door . " Largense a la escuela ! " As I stepped into the hallway , I saw through the corner of my eye Sergio 's father , his scarlet patch boiling , closing in on Sergio and Jorge . <p> A small crowd had assembled on the front stoop . Mrs. Gonzalez 's daughters , Vilma and Louisa , who already looked like their mother , old and bowlegged , though they were our age , were out there telling Carlos , Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared . That they had had it for the past week trying to bring their father back to his senses-Mr . Gonzalez , we all knew , routinely got drunk and beat his wife-and when they had awoken , the Virgin was gone , the window she had been placed by , opened . Their mother , they said , had gone to get Ms. Ramirez up the block . <p> " She 's upstairs with that guy , " Tony said . <p> " Who ? " said Vilma , stepping closer to Tony . <p> " Ms. Ramirez , that lady who leads the processions , she 's upstairs with that old Racine-Boy . " <p> " Ms. Ramirez is up there , Javy ? " Louisa asked me . She grabbed my arm and pulled me close , mashing her thick immature chest against my arm . <p> " I do n't know , " I said . I worked my arm free . <p> " Is it Ms. Ramirez ? " Louisa asked , and she stepped close to me again . " Is Sergio up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . She latched onto my arm . Tony and the others laughed . I looked up the street for Rogelio and Mrs. Gonzalez . <p> Neighbors were out by this time : Pedro , who lived in the other downstairs apartment , just home from his third shift at Ryerson Steel , his brown skin coated with a white powder that made you wonder exactly what he did . Bernardo Ruiz , in a metallic-blue housecoat , who lived the next building over , who danced evocatively during all the block parties , who everyone knew was gay but never said anything because he was ours , a member of our block , our gang , was there as well . And some of the more astute procession ladies had arrived also , their pink and green hair curlers seeming to have picked up the potential for controversy like radar . The Gonzalez daughters began calling up the stairwell to Rowdy . <p> " Rowdy , " Vilma said . " Is Ms. Ramirez up there ? " <p> " Tenemos un emergency , " Louisa added . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to calm everybody down , convince Mrs. Gonzalez that the Virgin did n't actually fly away , that someone had simply stolen her , and that , besides , the Virgin was only a statue anyway , and another could be bought at Opal 's Occultos on Eighteenth Street . But I also knew Rogelio 's mother would be coming down the stairs any minute , that Rogelio would see her and realize we had been up there spying on her . <p> By now Sergio , Jorge , and their parents were downstairs , their father with his cap on . Sergio 's face was flush , his eyes glazed over . Jorge , on the other hand , seemed content , as if things , at least for him , could 've gone worse . <p> " What 's going on ? " Sergio asked softly . <p> I told him about the Virgin . I told him how Mrs. Gonzalez was trying to find Rogelio 's mother . He looked up the stairs and whispered , " El trutho comes outo . " He rubbed his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . <p> Mrs. Gonzalez finally came waddling back up Throop Street . The procession regulars from Rogelio 's building followed . She came to us , her lips trembling . She held her fingers to her mouth . Just as she took a breath to speak , a step sounded , and we all turned to look up the apartment building 's stairs , where Ms. Ramirez in her red pumps had appeared . <p> She came down slowly , each step accompanied by the sharp clap of a heel on the hollow wood stairs . She stepped out onto the building 's concrete stoop and scanned the small crowd . " Do n't look at me like that , " she said to everyone . Her voice was crisp and sharp . She had no makeup on . Her skin was darker than usual , her lips pale . She was pretty . She turned to the procession ladies . " I 'm sorry , all right , " she said , leaning forward . " But I 'm not like you . I do n't want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing , only his hairy legs and white boxers visible . <p> Ms. Ramirez stepped from the stoop and walked through the crowd . She looked to me . I could tell she was upset , but I knew she was n't at me . I looked into her eyes and knew she had no idea I was up there listening to her make love to Rowdy . <p> " Where 's Rogelio ? " I asked her . <p> " Rogelio ? " she said . " He left . He did n't tell you ? " <p> " No , " I said . <p> " He went to stay with his aunt yesterday . He did n't tell you ? " <p> " No , " I said . <p> " Sorry , " his mother said . She turned up Throop Street and began walking towards Eighteenth , the seam of her tan skirt just off-center . The crowd turned to look up the stairs , but Rowdy was gone . Within the building a door slammed . The sound echoed through the halls and exited the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sin verguenza ! What are we going to do now ? Where 's the Virgin ? " <p> No one knew what to do about the Virgin . Mrs. Gonzalez was assured by Sergio and Jorge 's parents that it did n't fly away , although Tony , the Morgan-Boy , kept saying that it did . That maybe the sin of the Gonzalez household had been too much for the Virgin , and she had flown back to heaven . <p> " Sin overload , " Tony said . He sighed and shook his head . Mrs. Gonzalez began to cry . <p> That incident brought an end to the Virgin Mary processions . No new leader came forward . The apostles seemed uninterested in electing anyone . <p> I fully expected to see Rogelio again , as if he had only gone away on vacation . But a couple of months later his mother moved out of the neighborhood as well , she and Rowdy loading up a dingy and rickety-looking U-Haul , a puff of black exhaust hang-ing on the corner of Eighteenth and Throop like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished , was stolen , kidnapped , like the Virgin out of Mrs. Gonzalez 's window . I know he was n't . I know his mother probably met up with him in Aurora and that they settled there , or somewhere else , maybe even farther away , a different state . But it still seems like his departure was sudden , even though he was gone before he ever left . I do n't know if Rogelio found out we were listening . I sometimes think he did and that that 's why he left . But then again maybe he did n't . Maybe he only remembers how it was when we were young . When childhood was the only neighborhood we lived in . <p>
