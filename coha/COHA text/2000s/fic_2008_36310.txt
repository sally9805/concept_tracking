According to John James Audubon , there was once a species of bird in southeastern Pennsylvania , the Cuvier 's kinglet , Regulus cuvieri , or , as Audubon liked to call it , Cuvier 's wren . And according to Addie and Tom Kavanagh , the mysterious bird may have magically appeared again nearly two hundred years later on a ridge near their home , seventy-five miles north of Audubon 's original sighting . <p> Audubon claimed that he had discovered this " pretty and rare species " on his father-in-law 's plantation , Fatland Ford , northwest of Philadelphia , in June of 1812 . As was his custom , he shot it in order to draw it , thinking at first it was the more common ruby-crowned kinglet . " I have not seen another since , nor have I been able to learn that this species has been observed by any other individual , " he wrote in his famous Birds of America . <p> But Audubon was n't known for his honesty . He claimed to be the son of a French admiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his father was actually a French merchant , slave dealer , and naval lieutenant , his mother an illiterate French chambermaid . And surely it was a practical move , this naming of a bird ( real or not ) for Baron Georges Cuvier , the famed French naturalist and one of Audubon 's earliest patrons . <p> Consider , also , the " joke " Audubon played on a naturalist named Constantine Samuel Rafinesque , when Audubon and his wife , Lucy , hosted Rafinesque at their Kentucky home in the summer of 1818 . For his guest Audubon described-and drew-ten species of imaginary fish that he claimed were native to the Ohio River . Rafinesque included accounts of these fish ( including something called the " devil-jack diamond fish , " described as between four and ten feet long , weighing up to four hundred pounds , and covered with bulletproof scales ) in several articles and eventually a book . <p> There has been no single sighting of a Cuvier 's kinglet in the two hundred years since Audubon claimed to have shot one . Unless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team who published the environmentalist and antiwar classic A Prosody of Birds - an odd blend of delicate artist 's plates and dense poetic scansions of birdsongs-in 1969 . Actually , only Addle claimed to have spotted the Cuvier 's kinglet , one morning at dawn . It was an overcast morning in May 2001 , and she was on a routine excursion into the field , on the ridge above her home along the Nisky Creek , near Burnham , Pennsylvania . Though he was n't present at the time , Tom has never disputed his wife 's claim . But , strange as it may seem to question the veracity of a serious scientist and teacher like Tom Kavanagh , there are reasons to doubt both him and Addle . <p> If what Addie saw that morning was not a Cuvier 's kinglet but a ruby-crowned kinglet-a mistake neither Addie nor Tom would be likely to make-then she had her reasons for such a mysterious lapse . Addie always had her reasons for every outlandish choice she made . And Tom loved her deeply through all of them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved birds too , though not with the nearly fanatical passion of her parents . She has loved them enough to write about them , off and on , since she was a child . But now she is less concerned about whether or not the Cuvier 's kinglet suddenly , magically , reappeared in southeastern Pennsylvania than about the instructions her mother presented to her and Tom two weeks ago-for what she wished them to do with her body : clear orders for a brazenly illegal burial . There is no easy way to handle such a request , as far as Scarlet can see . And it 's hard to say what Tom is thinking . <p> Now it is early May 2002 , the beginning of the spring migration through the northeastern United States . Scarlet and Tom are in Cider Cove , a sleepy , off-season town on the New Jersey shore , in the rambling old house , now a bed-and-breakfast , of Addie 's dear friend Cora . Scarlet would have expected her mother to choose to die in her own ramshackle cottage in Burnham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the Burnham cottage is a place filled with much history , and in the last ten years or so , even birdsong seemed , at times , to make Addie angry , or sad , or both . <p> Last night Scarlet left Addle , who was clearly drawing her last breaths , alone with Tom . She could n't bear to be there for the actual moment when her mother died . She curled up on a wicker divan on Cora 's screened porch , watching the stars , listening to the wind and the pounding of the waves at the end of the long slope down from Cora 's house . When Tom roused her a couple hours later , a filmy light was slipping through the purple clouds , and the hospice worker was packing her bag . <p> " Addie 's gone , Scarlet , " Tom said . " I 'd like you to help me move her body down the street . " And so Scarlet followed him into Cora 's studio , fitted for several weeks now with Addie 's hospital bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along with Lou , Addie 's other good friend . Now both of them were crying silently , busying themselves with straightening the bedclothes , tidying vases of flowers ; they seemed desperate to find something useful to do . Tom tucked a blanket around Addie 's body , as if to keep her warm . Every move , every gesture like this one seemed to Scarlet both funny and heartbreaking . She watched as he lifted her mother 's tiny , weightless body in his arms . <p> Tom tucked Addie in carefully once again when he lowered her onto the cot in the walk-in cooler of a restaurant several doors down from Cora 's house . This was Cider Cove 's only seafood restaurant , owned by a trusted and discreet friend of Cora 's and open , in the off-season , only on weekends . Tom had told Cora that they might need a few days to work out " the arrangements , " and within fifteen minutes she 'd arranged this access to the restaurant cooler with her friend . <p> Neither of them wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely better to have her body there , not worrying them all back at Cora 's while they tried to figure out what to do next . Scarlet was quiet and compliant as they moved and arranged Addie 's body ; she felt like a child again , relying on her father to handle everything , particularly everything involving her puzzle of a mother . <p> Addie looked like a child herself . Scarlet held her mother 's hand for a while , but eventually that felt forced to her , as though she were trying to play the role of the grieving daughter instead of actually being one . She had already had her moments , her real moments , with Addie : first , two nights before , when Addie had seemed suddenly present and clear , herself again , when Scarlet had spoken with her alone . And then just moments ago , following her father down the street , below the familiar Cider Cove streetlights , watching how tenderly he cradled Addie 's body , his face buried in her neck , breathing her in one last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last and walked back to Cora 's in silence as dawn broke around them . Tom went inside to gather his binoculars and scope and headed out in search of birds . Scarlet got her notebook and returned to the porch . Cora and Lou were nowhere in sight . <p> And so Scarlet started writing . Some years ago she 'd had a moment of success as a poet , success that was complicated by its connection with her mother . Two of the better-known poems in her one published book were , indirectly but clearly , about Addie . They were also , in some ways , about birds . That book had won a small literary prize in 1995 , at the peak of Addie 's fame-or notoriety , depending on one 's outlook . This was a year after Addie had run afoul of some people in Washington over an installation involving , among other things , two crucified gulls . <p> For years Alex , Scarlet 's editor , has been pushing her to write a memoir . " It 's a logical step for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence in your poems , all the connections , " he has told her repeatedly . " And frankly , " he seems always to add , " it 's the only way you 're going to make any money as a writer . " <p> But , as she has told Alex many times , Scarlet has no idea how one goes about writing a memoir . Sometimes she has tried to imagine telling the story of their lives as a play . Now , as she sits on Cora 's sunporch in the pink-gray light of dawn , she thinks about beginning with the cast of characters assembled nearby : <p> The husband , Tom , barely visible at the far southern end of the beach , his scope trained on a plover 's nest a hundred yards away . <p> The two friends from Addie 's college days , Cora and Lou , offstage doing who-knows-what . Probably Cora is baking something . Maybe Lou is shopping . <p> And then there is Dustin , the young man at work outside Cora 's studio window , sawing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these into some semblance of a coffin . A more logical addition might surely be Addie 's brother , John . But he is in Scranton , probably at work . Scarlet wonders whether Tom will even call him . She has n't seen her uncle since her college graduation . Instead of a brother and an uncle , she thinks , her family has Dustin the coffin-maker . <p> Finally there is Scarlet herself : a sometime poet , wrapped in a sleeping bag on the chilly porch where she spent the night because her room upstairs holds too many memories . Scarlet , fighting the urge to seize one of the cigarettes Lou has left behind , not even drinking coffee , scribbling madly in a notebook , leading the others to imagine that she is penning eloquent , mournful poems . <p> When in fact she is trying to envision a memoir . Which , unlike the poems she wishes she was writing , feels to Scarlet like a kind of betrayal-of Addie , of Tom , of them all . How could she possibly pull together the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has managed only a list of possible titles . One is Zugunruhe - the term in German for the migratory restlessness of birds , and Tom 's affectionate name for the last twelve years of Scarlet 's life , spent making her way down the eastern seaboard , finally landing in New York . A migration punctuated with brief stays on the coast of New Jersey-a place that suddenly , once again , has begun to feel like home . <p> But that is Scarlet 's life , not Addie 's , and it 's Addie 's life that Alex , and others , are really interested in . The years of Scarlet 's migration , through the decade of the 1990s up to this cool and puzzling spring of 2002 , were relatively quiet ones for Addie . Had her mother somehow been holding her breath , reining herself in , waiting to see how far south , and now how near to this overdeveloped coastline , Scarlet would fly ? Had she been watching for those final fledgling years to pass before her next-and last-great scheme ? <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first bout with cancer in the most conventional of ways : two rounds of chemotherapy , a bit of radiation . Not many people know this . Far more people have heard about the second , far more invasive cancer , the one she chose not to fight . <p> There is another possible title for a story about Addie Kavanagh : Field Notebooks . <p> Scarlet has access to all of her father 's and nearly all of her mother 's notebooks from the field , all neatly penned in black ink on 15.2-by-24.1-centimeter loose-leaf paper , one side only , red margins penciled in an inch and a half from the left , bound in three-ring binders ( 20.3 by 25.4 cm ) . All of Addie 's coded to correspond with carefully compiled portfolios of her drawings and studies for paintings . All-except for their content-in accordance with the conventions established by Professor Joseph Grinnell at Berkeley in the early decades of the twentieth century . " No notebook this day , no sleep this night ! " were Grinnell 's famous words ; he also urged his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to educate their readers , to add to the store of knowledge of all who might one day encounter them . Tom Kavanagh presented Grinnell 's field notebook conventions , in painstaking detail , to Addie and the other students in his May-term Biology of the Birds class at Burnham College in the spring of 1965-that notorious 1965 class , the one that might have gotten him fired . The class that prompted a year 's leave , which led to his only book and to Addie 's first rough but moving paintings of birds-and , ultimately , to Scarlet . <p> Scarlet has all of Addie 's notebooks save one , her first , the one from that five-week course in May , spanning the spring migration through the woods and rivers of eastern Pennsylvania . The notebook with which she seduced Tom . It will be Scarlet 's , he has told her , when he dies-leaving her to imagine , for now , what Addle might have written there . <p> There are times , despite her mother 's long and maddening silences , when Scarlet feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 1965 <p> Thursday <p> Sunday Woods , Burnham , Bucks Co. , PA ( 1-2 mi. from Burnham College campus , via Ridge Path behind the Hall of Science ) <p> Time : 05:20-06:30-Plum Pond ; 06:40-07:30-Large meadow SE of Plum Pond <p> Observers : Burnham College Biology of the Birds class ( 20 students + Prof. Kavanagh ) <p> Habitat : Tall grasses at the muddy edge of Plum Pond , a small freshwater pond in a natural basin at the center of pine and scrub woods ; meadow 1/2 mi .

According to all the stories you 've been telling us , all the great lovers of birds-John James Audubon , Louis Agassiz Fuertes , Roger Tory Peterson , and you-discovered their passion at an early age .

It feels sometimes like I never even saw a bird until last fall , when I went to England to study . What was I doing before that ? I do n't know , reading poetry , going out , listening to music , staying up late talking to my roommates . Then one dreary day in early October , when I was to read a paper on Keats 's " Ode to a Nightingale " in my tutorial , my tutor , Miss Smallwood , brought in her personal collection of three Audubon plates , including one of a nightingale-not the English one , of course , but the American hermit thrush . <p> " Let 's talk about these today instead , " she said . " Are n't they marvelous ? " <p> And they were . They were maybe the most beautiful things I 'd ever seen . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
