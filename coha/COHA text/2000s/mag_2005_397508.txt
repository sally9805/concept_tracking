Section : Health for Life The wind and rain have died down . But the hurricane left behind a toxic health-care crisis <p> HURRICANE KATRINA blew the roof off Ron Smith 's New Orleans house . He hitchhiked out of town , spent a night in a darkened HoJo 's lobby and , later , waded through fetid waters back home . But those were the least of his problems . For two decades , Smith , 53 , has battled HIV , and in the wake of the storm , with clinics flooded and physicians scattered , he missed more than a month of experimental treatments  --  treatments he believes were helping to counteract his body 's growing resistance to standard drug therapy . He dropped 15 pounds and his healthy T-cell count plummeted . It 's an ongoing struggle , says Smith , but " I refuse to give up and die . " <p> First there was the water and winds . Now there 's the health-care challenge . Even before the storm , the Southeastern states ( nickname : " the stroke belt " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poverty . In a survey taken of evacuees in Houston after Katrina , half said they had no health insurance ; 41 percent reported suffering from chronic conditions , like heart disease , hypertension , asthma , diabetes and cancer . " We 're the poster children for poor health in terms of chronic disease , " says Elizabeth Fontham , dean of the School of Public Health at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center . " Hurricane Katrina was no cure for those problems and they 're likely to be exacerbated . " They 're also likely to linger  --  for months , if not years , to come . <p> It 's not just the body that has been battered , but the mind as well . In a survey released by LSU last week , 39 percent of Louisiana residents reported feeling angry and 53 percent said they were depressed . Already , mental-health systems are stressed . In Louisiana , for example , only 28 percent of adults and 3.5 percent of children identified as having a mental illness receive care  --  and that was before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to struggle as otherwise healthy Gulf Coast residents succumb to the storm 's psychological aftereffects , now festering like sediment in the floodwaters . Times-Picayune columnist Chris Rose , describing the collapsed roofs and the " permanent bathtub ring " around the city , put it bluntly : " We 're all whacked . How could you not be ? " <p> Rarely has a health-care system been so strained . New Orleans ' big state-run hospitals , Charity and University , have been shut down since the storm . Private clinics are working with skeletal staffs . And evacuees are  --  swamping those facilities that are operating . Visits to outpatient clinics at Baton Rouge 's Earl K. Long Medical Center have jumped 50 percent  --  from 8,000 patients a month to more than 12,000 . Donald Smithburg , CEO of the LSU Health Care Services Division , is trying to lease new hospital space , and he has until Dec. 18 to hire back staff in New Orleans ( 2,600out of 4,000 employees had to be furloughed ) . But just weeks before his deadline , Smithburg says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's worried about how a fractured infrastructure will care for the sick and injured . " We 're a bus wreck or a plane crash away from another catastrophe , " he says . <p> Amid the chaos , patients with chronic health problems have been scrambling to receive care . Theresa Billiot 's main concern after Katrina was n't so much the loss of her home in Port Sulphur , La.  --  it was how she was going to get her next chemo infusion . " I was scared to death , " says Billiot , 54 , who has lung cancer . Billiot 's two daughters , who live in Massachusetts , managed to fly her to Boston , where she received two chemo sessions and 30 radiation treatments at Dana Farber Cancer Institute . Other evacuees have been struggling to get back on track without having good information about their medical history  --  how many radiations they had or what kind of drugs they were on . " They would tell the physician , ' I take a blue pill , ' says Pam Dotson of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the storm 's great casualties . Weeks after his office was drenched in 11 feet of water , Dr. Floyd Buras , a New Orleans pediatrician , found his patients ' records disintegrating in his hands . Hoping his computer records would fare better , Buras sent his disks to a company specializing in data recovery from shipwrecks . So far , no luck . " They may well be lost , " he says . <p> Even more disturbing : some patients are unaccounted for , too . Take the HIV population in Greater New Orleans . Only half of the 1,600 patients registered with the AIDS Drug Assistance Program have been located since the storm , says Beth Scalco , Louisiana 's AIDS program director . Are the rest getting their meds ? Nobody knows . At New Orleans ' reopened HIV Outpatient Clinic , medical director Dr. Mary Murphy is worried . " I wonder where my very sick patients are , " she says . Some have landed in places where access to care is compounded by the disease 's stigma . John Simms , 51 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he disclosed that he was taking HIV medications . Others are concealing their diagnosis and perhaps going without drugs . " People could get sicker faster and may die faster , " says Scalco . <p> Their mental health is at risk , too . Studies show that 10 to 30 percent of people who are directly exposed to dangerous or traumatic events  --  the destruction of a home , the death of a loved one  --  will develop posttraumatic stress disorder , with its intrusive flashbacks and nightmares . On the whole , human beings are extraordinarily resilient : two thirds of those who suffer PTSD symptoms early on will recover in six to nine months , says David Vlahov , of the New York Academy of Medicine , who studied the psychological aftermath of 9/11 . Still , Katrina 's destruction was vast , stretching across a 90,000 square miles . Whole communities were destroyed and , within them , the social networks  --  families and neighbors , churches and synagogues , schools and YMCAs  --  that help sustain people in a crisis . Relocation is a double-edged sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings of abandonment . Health officials worry that some of those affected will turn to drugs and alcohol . Suicidal calls to a Louisiana help line have almost tripled since the hurricane . <p> Patrice Howard feels the stress . After water began seeping into her New Orleans apartment , Howard fled to the roof with her fianc , Marlon , and her two kids , Erica , 9 , and Carlton , 5 . The family huddled together for three days until they were rescued . Today , thanks to relatives in Cleveland , they 're safe . But " even though we have a roof , food and water , now we think about what we lost , " says Howard . " We were just getting ourselves together and now that life is gone . " She worries most about her children . Erica refuses to talk about the storm ; Carlton has trouble sleeping and has become clingy . Dana Jensen , a crisis-intervention specialist working with the children , says their reactions are not unusual . " This  --  family is grieving for their losses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evacuees , the uncertainty  --  Will I ever go home ? Where will I live ? Can I find a new job ?  --  is overwhelming . " I 'm in total limbo , " says Summer Savon , a Tulane medical resident also living in Ohio . " There is real misery in seeing everyone move ahead and you 're left behind . " Those feelings of hopelessness and demoralization can lead to a spectrum of mental-health disorders , from anxiety and behavioral problems to depression , says Dr. Jon Shaw , a trauma specialist at the University of Miami . Fred Sautter , a clinical psychologist at the New Orleans VA hospital , was preparing to treat soldiers returning from Iraq for PTSD when the storm hit . Now , displaced from his home , with his professional and private life disrupted  --  he and his fiance were supposed to be married in the city in October  --  he 's feeling the emotional weight himself . " You reach a point where you want to reach closure so you can move on , " says Sautter . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disasters suggests that mental-health effects could persist long after the levees are rebuilt . In a study of Mexicans relocated after a 1999 flood , Fran Norris , a professor of psychiatry at Dartmouth Medical School , found that evacuees still suffered psychological distress two years later . " Most will recover , " says Norris , " but there 's usually a subset that has problems for a long time . " And when Bonnie Green , a professor of psychiatry at Georgetown University Medical School , compared survivors of a dam collapse and flood in Buffalo Creek , W.Va. , to a nonaffected population , she found higher rates of anxiety , depression and hostility  --  14 years after the event . <p> Nobody , however , is giving up . Government officials estimate that 500,000 people may need mental-health assistance , and this week the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services plans to announce a public-service ad campaign encouraging hurricane victims to get help . Psychologists and social workers are doing their own outreach , visiting shelters and trailer parks . Doctors and nurses are , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinic has treated about 1,500 evacuees . And individual practitioners , many of them volunteers , are doing whatever they can to help . K. C. Arnold , a nurse practitioner who took care of diabetics at a now closed clinic , opened her own center in Mississippi last month so patients could get the medications they need . While there are frustrations  --  never enough funding or resources  --  there is also an abundance of good will . " People are committed to helping , " says Dr. David Post , medical director of a public mental-health agency in Baton Rouge , " and it 's getting better . " <p> Ron Smith , for one , is optimistic . He 's back in treatment and is waiting for his latest blood tests , which he hopes will show a marked improvement . Five-year-old Carlton is hopeful , too . Asked if there was anything cool about living in Cleveland , he said , " Well , I saw a rainbow after the rain . We could n't catch it , but it was pretty .
