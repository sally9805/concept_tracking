Why lenders are punishing those who borrow too little and always pay on time . If you pay your credit-card bills in full each month , you probably did n't take much notice when President Barack Obama signed legislation in late May aimed at keeping banks from doing such things as hiking interest rates with little or no notice and engaging in other consumer-unfriendly practices . But do n't assume that just because you rarely carry a balance , you are immune from poor treatment at the hands of credit-card issuers . Banks have cut off or pared back an estimated $1 trillion in credit lines since the peak of the credit boom , according to the now famously bearish analyst Meredith Whitney ( who accurately predicted Citigroup 's meltdown back in 2007 ) . Moreover , according to a study from the maker of the all-important FICO credit score , recent cutbacks have hit twice as many of the most financially responsible consumers -- those with a median credit score of 770 -- as those with crummy credit . " These people have done everything right , " says Greg McBride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some arbitrary decision could torpedo their credit score . " Why ? Because the formula for determining credit scores , which banks use to decide whether to give you a mortgage or any other loan , looks at something called your " utilization ratio , " the total amount of credit you use vs. the amount you have available . If you have $25,000 worth of available credit and you put $5,000 on your cards every month , your utilization ratio is a healthy , **30;1278;TOOLONG 20% . But cut down that credit line to $10,000 and suddenly your ratio jumps to 50% , making you look pretty overextended . So why would lenders target the good customers ? Mainly because banks ca n't afford to take a lot of risk anymore . If you have , say , $30,000 in unused credit sitting around , there 's always the chance you 'll start tapping into it in the event of a job loss or other financial crisis .

" Credit-card companies are on a reign of terror , " he says . " The new rules are n't going to change that anytime soon .

That may not be enough these days to keep banks from reducing your credit line , which could drive down your credit score . Here 's how to protect your cred : STAY ACTIVE Since more lenders are shutting inactive accounts , make a small purchase -- like a tank of gas -- every other month or so on all the cards you own , says Credit.com chairman Adam Levin .

While one bank may decide you 're a risky bet , another might be happy to keep your business . THINK ABOUT TIMING Opening new lines of credit will drag down your score in the short term . So it 's probably best to hold off on this if you 're planning to apply for a loan within the next six months .
