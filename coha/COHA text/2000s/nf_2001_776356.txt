THE REVOLUTION // Slavery and Independence // I served in the Revolution , in General Washington 's army . . . . I have stood in battle , where balls , like hail , were flying all around me . The man standing next to me was shot by my side  --  his blood spouted upon my clothes , which I wore for weeks . My nearest blood , except that which runs in my veins , was shed for liberty . My only brother was shot dead instantly in the Revolution . Liberty is dear to my heart  --  I can not endure the thought , that my countrymen should be slaves . //  --  " Dr. Harris , " a black Revolutionary veteran , in an address to the Congregational and Presbyterian Anti-Slavery Society of Francestown , New Hampshire , 1842. // Crispus Attucks : The First Martyr of the Revolution // " BLOODY MASSACRE , " screamed the March 12 , 1770 , issue of the Massachusetts Gazette , Paul Revere 's four-color illustrated broadsheet , depicting redcoats with muskets firing into a crowd of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground .

" ( Revere omitted Patrick Carr , an Irish leather worker , who was also killed . ) Gray was a rope maker , Maverick an apprentice joiner , Caldwell a ship 's mate ; the seaman Attucks , " killed on the Spot , two Balls entering his Breast , " was described as " born in Framingham , but lately belonging to New Providence the Bahamas . " The victims would lie in state in Faneuil Hall . " All the Bells tolled a solemn Peal " when they were buried together in one vault " in the middle burying-ground.

" In port in Boston on the night of March 5 , 1770 , Attucks was in a King Street tavern when an alarm bell was heard from the street 's British sentry . When , leading a stick- and bat-wielding gang from the tavern , he discovered that the sentry was under " attack " only from snowball-throwing boys , he and his mob immediately took the side of the boys against the " Lobster Backs "  --  using heavy sticks instead of snowballs . Witnesses said that Attucks , striking the first blow , caused arriving British soldiers to open fire and hit eleven civilians  --  five of whom , including Attucks , were killed . // At the cost of public scorn ( and to cover up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boston lawyer John Adams , a radical " Son of Liberty " who disapproved of violence , defended the British soldiers . Contradicting Paul Revere 's presentation of the dead as respectable Bostonians , Adams declared that Attucks had been the leader of a " motley rabble of saucy boys , negroes and molattoes , Irish teagues and outlandish jack tarrs . " The merchant John Hancock also accused Attucks of provoking the so-called " Boston Massacre , " but from a different point of view . " Who set the example of guns ? " Hancock asked later . " Who taught the British soldier that he might be defeated ? Who dared look into his eyes ? I place , therefore , this Crispus Attucks in the foremost rank of the men that dared . " The British soldiers were acquitted , but Americans won the propaganda battle . Attucks and his companions became the first popular martyrs of the Revolution . // " You will hear from Us with Astonishment , " read an anonymous letter to Governor Thomas Hutchinson in 1773 , which John Adams copied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Us with Horror . You are chargeable before God and Man , with our Blood  --  The Soldiers were but passive Instruments . . . .

Only a fraction of that population went to war . Some five thousand blacks served under George Washington , and about a thousand , mostly Southern runaways , fought for George III . Although the percentage of the black population who served was small , by 1779 as many as one in seven members of Washington 's never very large army were black . According to the historian Thomas Fleming , the Continental Line was " more integrated than any American force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wars . " // The Great American " Fig Tree " // At the end of the French and Indian Wars , Britain controlled North America from the Atlantic to the Mississippi , as well as most of the West Indies . It had reached the zenith of its empire just as the colonies were beginning to have a sense of nationhood . " Cast your eyes with me a little over this globe to view the deplorable state of your fellow creatures in other countries , " wrote the Philadelphia lawyer John Dickinson in 1768 . " In Russia , Poland , Bohemia , Hungary , and many parts of Germany there is no such thing as free-holders . . . . But how different is the case amongst us . We enjoy an unprecarious property , and every man may freely taste the fruits of his own labors under his vine and under his fig tree . " // The debt Britain had incurred in the Seven Years ' War ensured taxation of the colonies and threatened life under the idyllic American fig tree . In British eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother country , but Americans saw any form of taxation as slavery . New England 's objections to the Sugar Act , the Stamp Act , and all the other unpopular acts fueled the fires of independence . John Adams and his failed businessman cousin Samuel , leading radicals in the Continental Congress , were outspoken " Sons of Liberty , " a term coined in the British Parliament in 1765 to describe American Stamp Act protestors . Samuel Adams created the Committees of Correspondence , an underground movement with branches springing up throughout New England , to encourage resistance against the British . // The fires of independence were fueled among blacks as well as whites . A Massachusetts petition of 1773 from " a Grate Number of Blacks . . . who . . . are held in a state of slavery within the bowels of a free and Christian Country " asked for freedom and " some part of the unimproved land , belonging to the province , for a settlement , that each of us may there sit down quietly under his own fig tree . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Massachusetts Puritans preached against slavery , but only Quakers argued for justice and equality for blacks on every level of life . In 1727 , the twenty-one-year-old Philadelphia printer Benjamin Franklin started a discussion group , the Junto , in which antislavery ideals figured large . Two years later he printed , anonymously , the first of his many antislavery tracts . " A Caution and a Warning to Great Britain and Her Colonies , " a pamphlet published in 1766 by a Philadelphia Quaker named Anthony Benezet , was widely circulated . " How many of those who distinguish themselves as Advocates of Liberty remain insensible , " he wrote , " to the treatment of thousands and tens of thousands of our fellow men , who . . . are at this very time kept in the most deplorable state of slavery . " Meanwhile , Boston 's James Otis , another outspoken opponent of Britain 's " Intolerable Acts , " wrote : " The colonists are by the law of nature free born , as indeed are all men , white or black . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery would eventually be abandoned , and in the meantime ameliorated . In 1762 , George Washington told his new overseer to " take all necessary and proper care of the Negroes , using them with proper humanity and discretion . " Young Thomas Jefferson 's first legislative action in the 1769 Virginia House of Burgesses was an emancipation measure . With so many important advocates , many believed that the new American nation would be free . // Slavery was abolished in the British Isles in 1772 . The decision resulted from the suit of one slave , James Somerset , who ran away from his American master in England . Somerset 's lawyer , the British abolitionist Granville Sharp , won the case by arguing that since no positive law creating slavery existed in England , it could not be practiced there . Three days after the judgment , a group of two hundred blacks " with their ladies " held a public entertainment in Westminster " to celebrate the triumph of their Brother Somerset .

Benjamin Franklin wrote to Anthony Benezet about the " hypocrisy " of Britain " for promoting the Guinea trade , while it piqued itself on its virtue . . . in setting free a single Negro . " // By 1774 , Boston  --  whose port was closed until the eighteen thousand pounds of tea dumped in the harbor the previous December was paid for  --  was the center of abolition as well as revolution . " No country can be called free when there is one slave , " wrote James Swan , a Boston merchant and Son of Liberty who had disguised himself as an Indian in the Boston Tea Party . " It has always appeared a most iniquitous scheme to me , " Abigail Adams wrote to her husband , John , " to fight for what we are daily robbing and plundering from those who have as good a right to freedom as we have . " // In November 1774 , the thirty-seven-year-old Tom Paine arrived in Philadelphia with a letter of introduction to Benjamin Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax collector , was drawn to abolition as much by his sympathy for antigovernment politics as by his Quaker background . Franklin helped Paine become editor of The Pennsylvania Magazine , where his first published article , " African Slavery in America , " appeared on March 8 , 1775 . " With what consistency , or decency , " he wrote , could colonists " complain so loudly of attempts to enslave them , while they hold so many hundred thousand in slavery . " Paine advocated abolition , land redistribution , and economic opportunity . Two weeks later Patrick Henry , a slave owner who called slavery " repugnant to humanity , " raised the American battle cry with " Give me liberty or give me death ! " America 's first antislavery society met in Philadelphia on April 14 , 1775 . Five days later , America was at war with Britain .
