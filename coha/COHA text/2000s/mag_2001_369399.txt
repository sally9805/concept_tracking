According to the laws of Mother Nature , electricity follows the path of least resistance . Mother apparently has n't been hanging around California recently , where last week rolling blackouts spread darkness at noon across some of the richest cropland , most complex high-tech factories and busiest streets in America . <P> The blackouts were the latest and most painful phase of a statewide energy crisis that has been years in the making and continues to worsen , triggered by a spectacularly twisted and shortsighted deregulation plan . It has enraged consumers and businessmen even as it has pushed California 's two largest utilities toward bankruptcy . It threatens to undermine the state 's $1.3 trillion economy , the sixth largest on Earth , and rock the U.S. overall as it struggles to avoid a recession . <P> The crisis is also part of a nationwide winter of energy discontent in which natural-gas rates have soared to their highest level in 15 years , and that ever lovable cartel , OPEC , has slashed its oil output again to keep prices up . California 's woes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen as presidential timber , to George W. Bush , who last week stiffed Davis ' request for federal aid to the staggering utilities . <P> At the same time , California has cast its shadow over ambitious deregulation plans being launched in such states as Oklahoma , Nevada and Arkansas ( see following stories ) . Says Daniel Yergin , chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates : " The California crisis puts questions about our entire energy infrastructure front and center . " <P> The state 's largely self-inflicted energy wounds are rich in irony . A deregulation plan that was supposed to cut electric rates has instead more than tripled what some California consumers pay and has proved powerless to slow a tenfold increase in the state 's wholesale prices . And instead of pulling regulators out of the utility business , the plan has plunged Sacramento and Washington ever more deeply into it . Last week Davis , who has called the deregulation plan a " colossal and dangerous failure " while also railing against " out-of-state profiteers , " signed an emergency order that empowers the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a measure that could keep supplies at adequate levels for a few days at best . <P> Small wonder that California seethes with anger and accusations as furious consumers , power suppliers , legislators and regulators point fingers at one another . " Consumers are being asked to conserve on power , but suppliers are unwilling to give up a shred of their profits , " complains Susan Weisberg , a San Francisco editor whose home office went dark for more than an hour last Thursday . In Sacramento , Republican state representative Keith Richman , a practicing physician , accuses Davis of Hamlet-like indecisiveness as the crisis worsened . " If I had stood by and watched one of my patients decline without taking action , " Richman says , " I would be sued for malpractice and have had my license revoked . And I would have deserved it . "
