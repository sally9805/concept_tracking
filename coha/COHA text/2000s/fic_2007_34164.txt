Chapter 1 I was almost born Happy . Literally , Feliz was the Spanish name my mother wanted for me . Not a family name , not a local name , just a hope , stated in the farthest-reaching language she knew-a language that once reached around the world , to the Netherlands , Africa , the Americas , the Philippines . Only music has reached farther and penetrated more deeply . I say " almost born Feliz , " because the name that attached itself to me instead , thanks to a sloppy bureaucrat 's bias toward Catalan saints ' names , was Feliu . Just one letter changed on my death-yes , death-certificate . My father was overseas that year , working as a customs officer in colonial Cuba . The afternoon my mother 's labor pains started , my father 's elder sister changed into a better dress , for church . Mam bent over a chair near the kitchen doorway , legs splayed , ankles turned inward , as the weight of my dropping body pulled her pelvis to the floor . While she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the chair 's straw-plaited back . " I will light candles for you , " Ta said . " I do n't need prayers . I need- " My mother moaned , angling her hips from side to side , trying to find a position where the pain eased . Cool water ? A chamber pot ? " . . . help , " was all she could say . " I 'll send Enrique to get the midwife . " Ta pushed the ebony combs into her thick masses of gray-streaked hair . " No , I 'll go myself , on the way . Where 's Percival ? " My oldest brother had slipped outside minutes earlier , bound for the bridge and the dry wash beneath it , along which the local shepherds drove their flocks . He and his friends hid there frequently , playing cards amid orange peels and broken barrel staves that reeked of vinegar . Percival was old enough to remember the previous disasters in sharp detail , and he did n't want to witness another . Mam 's last baby had died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a few days , while my mother herself hovered near death , racked with infection-induced fever . In Campo Seco , she was not the only unlucky one . My mother blamed the midwife who had moved to the village four years earlier , accompanied by her husband , a butcher . " They do n't wash their hands , " Mam panted . " Last time , I saw the forceps she used . Broken at the hinge . Flakes " - she squirmed and jammed the heel of her palm into her back- " flakes of rust . " " Ridiculous ! " Ta drew the lace mantilla over her head . " You are worrying for nothing . You should pray , instead . " My two other siblings , Enrique and Luisa , remained stoic in the face of my mother 's barnyard moans , the slick of straw-colored amniotic fluid on the floor , which five-year-old Luisa wiped away ; the bloody smears on the wet towels , which seven-year-old Enrique wrung and dipped in a wide porcelain bowl . By the third dip , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscured beneath a smoky layer of pink water . Thirty minutes after Ta departed , the midwife arrived . Mam panted and strained from her marriage bed , pushing with all her strength while she struggled to keep her eyes open . She scrutinized the dirt crescents beneath the midwife 's fingernails . She twisted her neck to follow every step the midwife took , to catch fleeting glimpses of the tools displayed on a square of calico covering the bedside table , and the coil of gray cotton string that brought to mind the butcher 's leaky , net-covered roasts . When the midwife 's hands came near , Mam tried to close her knees , to shield me from ill fortune . But the urge to push could not be stopped . I was coming . And then-just as suddenly-I stopped coming . What had once moved too quickly stopped moving at all . Mam 's belly rippled and bulged a final time , then hardened into one long , unceasing contraction . Her jaw went slack . A blue vein bulged at her temple . Enrique , lingering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her legs , where the combination of taut , pearly flesh and wet hair made him think of washed-up jellyfish , collapsed against the weedy shore . The midwife caught him looking and snapped the sheet back into place , over Mam 's legs and high , round abdomen . That gesture hid one disturbing view , but it only drew more attention to what remained visible : my mother 's red face , beaded with sweat and contorted with pain . " Here , " Mam would say later , in recounting the story of my birth , " is where you decided to rebel . Whenever someone pushes you too hard , you do the opposite . " Actually , I was stuck : feet twisted up toward my neck , rear facing the only exit . A living churro tied into a bow . The midwife grunted as her hands pushed , prodded , and massaged beneath the loosely tented sheet , a question darkening her face . Forgetting Enrique , she tore away the sheet and whimpered at the sight of a small purple scrotum appearing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She watched that spot for ten minutes , twisting the cloth of her apron with red fingers . Then she panicked . Ignoring Enrique 's incredulous , upturned face and Luisa 's round eyes , she pushed past them both and down the stairs , missing the bottom step entirely . The midwife had left to fetch her husband , who was two blocks away , wiping his own stained hands . She could have sent my brother or called from the balcony to one of our neighbor 's fleet-footed children . But she was n't a bright woman . And she knew that a third infant death in one family would invite costly gossip . Already , she could envision the sea of dark shawls that would greet her from this day forward-the back of every neighbor woman 's averted head and rounded shoulders , snubbing her if I died , and my mother with me . Left unassisted , my mother summoned her resolve and tried to breathe more deeply . She felt safer with the midwife gone , ready to accept whatever happened . She asked Luisa to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her lips , though nausea allowed her to drink only a little . She called Enrique to come and take the forceps , to dip and scrub them in a bowl of the hottest water , to be ready . " They do n't open very well , " he said , struggling with the oval-shaped handles . They were fashioned from twisted iron and padded with small pieces of stitched dark leather that reminded Enrique of a sweat-stained horse saddle . " Are the pieces supposed to come apart ? " " Forget it . Put them down . Use your hands . " He blanched . Mam heard Luisa start to cry , and ordered her to sing-anything , a folk song , or " Vamos a la Mar , " a happy round they 'd all chanted on picnic trips to the Mediterranean coast . " . . . to eat fish in a wooden dish . . . " Luisa sang , again and again , and then : " I see something ! It 's a foot ! " Another push . A narrow back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother lost consciousness . I 've been told I hung there for a while , the picture of blind indecision , with my head refusing to follow my pasty body . Until Enrique , decisive enough for us both , stepped forward and pushed a small hand into the dark , hooking a finger around my chin . Following my final , slippery emergence , he laid me on my mother 's belly , still attached by the cord to the afterbirth inside her . There was no spank ; no bawling cries . Mam briefly surfaced into consciousness once again with instructions for Enrique on how to tie the cord with the gray string in two places , and how to cut the flattened purple cable in between . He moved me onto my mother 's chest , but I did n't root . One of my legs hung more limply than the other , the hip joint disturbingly flaccid . No one cleared the white residue plugging my tiny nostrils . Mam 's arms lay at her sides , too tired to embrace me . There was little point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not swell . " It 's cold , " Luisa said . " We should wrap it . " " He 's cold , " Enrique corrected . " A boy . " My mother sounded both pleased and resigned , her cheeks wet as she relived what had happened before and would happen again : the increasing pain as her adrenaline ebbed , the incapacitating fever , the deep plunge into confused sleep from which she might not return . " Tell the midwife it was not her fault . The notary will come to the door . There is a blank card with an envelope in the drawer , with the money . Write the name down for him , so there is no mistake : Feliz Anbal Delargo Domenech . " She gritted her teeth , waited for a spasm to subside . " Is it cold in here , Luisa ? " " It 's hot , Mam . " " The notary will inform the priest " - she sucked in a mouthful of air , then bit down on her lower lip- " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Mam did not explain . " Enrique-you know how to spell Anbal , like your great-uncle . " Enrique shook his head . " Like the conqueror from Carthage , the man with the elephants . " " I do n't know how , " my brother protested , more alarmed by the request to write my name than he 'd been by the drama of pulling a reluctant baby from the womb . But the long list and the imagined tasks ahead-a letter to Pap , a visitation , a burial-had exhausted the last of Mam 's stamina . She closed her eyes and swung her head from side to side , trying to catch an elusive breeze . She began , " A-N-I-B . . . " and then lost consciousness again .
