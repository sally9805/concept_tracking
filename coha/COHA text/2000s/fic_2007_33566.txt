At the edge of the sea , the small village , even among the shadows of its lush oaks and pines , seemed smothered by the unseasonal summer heat that had baked into every stairway and crevice and shop wall . The rising coastal temperatures , mixed with high humidity from the sullen Pacific , produced a sweltering steam bath that had lasted through all of July , and was not typical for the central California coast . The scent of hot pinesap was mixed sharply with the salty stink of iodine at low tide . And from the narrow streets , the scent of suntan oil rose unpleasantly to the three cats where they sprawled on a cottage rooftop , in the ineffectual shade of a stone chimney , indolently washing their paws-avoiding the crush of tourists ' feet and the scorching sidewalks , which felt like a giant griddle ; if a cat stood for a moment on the concrete , he 'd come away with blistered paws-Joe Grey 's white paws felt blistered . The gray tomcat sprawled , limp , across the shingles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tried to imagine cool sea winds . Near Joe , the long-haired tortoiseshell lifted her head occasionally to lick one mottled black-and-brown paw . Kit had the longest coat of the three , so she was sure she suffered themost . Only dark tabby Dulcie was up and moving , irritably pacing . Joe watched her , convinced she was fretting for no reason . But you could n't tell Dulcie anything ; she 'd worked herself into a state over her housemate and nothing he could say seemed to help . Below them on the narrow streets , the din of strangers ' voices- reached them , and the shrill laughter of a group of children . Tourists wandered by the dozens , dressed in shorts and sandals , lapping up ice cream and slipping into small shops looking for a breath of cooler air ; the restaurant patios were crowded with visitors enjoying iced drinks , their leashed dogs panting beneath the tables . Strangers stared in through the windows of shaded cottages that were tucked among bright gardens , into shadowed sitting rooms and bedrooms that looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a pair of loud-voiced , sweating joggers heading for the beach to run on the damp sand , as if they might catch up to an ocean breeze . With a soft hush of paws , Dulcie came to stand beside him at the edge of the roof , silent and frowning , looking not at the busy streets below but up at the round hills that rose above the village-hills burnt dry now , humping against the sky as brown as grazing beasts . They could see nothing moving there , no human hiking the dusty trails , no rider on horseback ; the deer and small wild creatures would be asleep in the shade , if they could find any shade . Even among the ruins hidden among the highest slopes , the feral cats would be holed up in cool caverns beneath the fallen walls . For a long time Dulcie stood looking in that direction , her peach-tinted ears sharply forward , her head tilted in a puzzled frown . " What ? " Joe said , watching her . " I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes wide and perplexed . " I feel like . . . As if they 're thinking of us . " She blinked and lashed her tail . " As if Willow is thinking of us , as if she knows how I feel . " She narrowed her green eyes at him , but then she rubbed against his shoulder , brushing her whiskers against his . " I guess that makes no sense ; maybe it 's the heat . " Joe did n't answer . He knew she was upset-and females were prone to fancies . Who knew what two females together , even at such a distance , could conjure between them ? Maybe both Dulcie and the pale calico had that fey quality humans found so mysterious in the feline . Maybe their wild , feral friend , with her unusual talents of perception and speech that matched their own , maybe she did indeed sense that Dulcie was worried and fretting . Who knew what Willow was capable of ? But Dulcie was worrying over nothing , as far as Joe could see . Dulcie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend , driving up the coast to the city , and Dulcie had never fretted as she did now . Now , Dulcie thought she had reason , and Joe looked at her intently . " Prisoners have escaped from jail before , Dulcie . That , and the fact that Wilma is later than she promised , does not add up to disaster . You 're building a mountain out of pebbles . " Dulcie turned , hissing at him . " Cage Jones better keep away from her . Wilma 's done with supervising him and too many bad-ass convicts like him , done with the kind of stress they dumped on her for twenty years . She does n't need any more ugly tangles and ugly people messing up her life . " But despite what either Dulcie or Joe thought , tangles were building , complications that would indeed snare Dulcie 's housemate . The scenario had started two months earlier on the East Coast , when an old man entered the continental U.S. When Greeley Urzey stepped off that plane , he set in motion events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely as a cat 's paw will snarl a skein of yarn . The old man 's flight from Central America entered the States officially at Miami , where passengers would connect with other flights after lining up to go through customs inspection . Deplaning , Greeley smiled , sure of himself and cocky . He 'd slip through customs clean as a whistle , as he always did , not an ounce of contraband on him , this time , for the feds to find . Even if he 'd had anything tucked away , he 'd have waltzed right on through slick as a greased porker , always had , always would , he 'd never yet got caught . And , he thought , smiling , there were better ways to bring what he wanted into the States . He 'd gotten most of it through over a period of years , tucked in among household furnishings in them big metal overseas containers . Them feds could n't search everything .                  @ @ @
