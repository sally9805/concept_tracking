Governor Gray Davis of California may have the charisma of a coatrack and he may irritate aides by taking conference calls on his exercise cycle in the morning , but he has not been accused of any crime , there are no state funds missing and no interns telling stories to the tabloids . So why is he facing a burgeoning movement to have him recalled from office less than a year after he was re-elected ? <P> Well , there 's California 's $38 billion deficit , the largest state shortfall in history , a number larger than the entire budget of all but one other state ( New York ) . Much of the deficit is due to the collapse of the dot-com universe , which powered the state 's economy in the ' 90s , and Davis can hardly be blamed for that . On the other hand , he was not exactly forthright about how large the deficit was going to be . In any case , Californians want a target for their fiscal pain and frustration , and Davis has become the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the San Andreas Fault , it 's Gray Davis ' fault , " comedian Dennis Miller said at a fund raiser for President Bush in Los Angeles last month . <P> Davis ' fate has had a seismic effect on Republicans in California and Washington , though for different reasons . As Republican state hopefuls  --  possibly including Arnold Schwarzenegger  --  line up to vie for Davis ' job , the White House is keeping its distance . With eyes fixed on the next presidential election , the White House would rather see a deeply unpopular Democratic Governor stay in his job , which might help Bush 's chances of winning the state in 2004  --  something no Republican has done since a different George Bush won there in 1988 . <P> Despite popularity ratings as low as 21% and a host of rivals circling him , Davis is defiant . He dismisses the recall campaign against him as " partisan mischiefmaking by Republican right-wingers . " In an interview with TIME last week , he said he would not resign , adding , " It 's like the Oakland Raiders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buccaneers because they did n't like the way they played in the Super Bowl . That 's not the way life works . "
