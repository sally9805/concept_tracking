In 1620 Edward Winslow ( 1595-1655 ) arrived in America on board the Mayflower with his wife and servants.1 Today , Careswell , the family 's estate in Marshfield , Massachusetts , stands as a memorial to the secular status the Windows attained over the next two hundred years . In the seventeenth century property ownership was the hallmark of the English aristocracy and the aspiration of the middling classes . The quest for property could be played out in New England by a " division " of land outside the town boundaries . The granting of small tracts eased the pressure of a growing population and the granting of large tracts rewarded gentlemen already prominent in the colony . After describing how Duxbury broke away from the town of Plymouth after one such division , William Bradford ( 1590-1657 ) , governor and chronicler of Plymouth Colony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any further scartering from this place and weakning of the same , it was thought best to give out some good farms to spetiall persons , that would promise to live at Plimoth , and lickly to be helpfull to the church or comonewelth , and so tye the land to Plimoth as farmes for the same . .... And so some spetiall lands were granted ... at Green 's Harbor today Marshfields2 .... Thus , in 1632 , Edward Winslow was granted a large tract , between 850 and 1,000 acres , in " a plase very weeU medowed , and fit to keep and rear catle , good store , " wrote Bradford . " But , alass ! , " he continued , this remedy proved worse than the disease ; for within a few years those that had thus gott footing rente themselves away , partly by force , and partly by wearing the rest with importunitie and pleas of necessitie , so as they must either suffer them to goe , or live in continuall opposition and contention.3 Winslow named his estate " Careswell , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . In the years immediately following 1632 Window did return in the winters to the town of Plymouth as agreed , but by 1636 he had built the first of the Winslow houses at Careswell and had moved his family there permanently By 1640 Winslow and the other property owners in Greens Harbor wheedled , cajoled , and bullied the Massachusetts General Court ( legislature ) to be allowed to create a new township within the colony separate from the town of Plymouth . It was just what Bradford had feared.4 Photograph Pl . V. The original entrance hall was enlarged in the mid-eighteenth centiny with the foyer ( foreground ) added by General John Winslow . Next to the stair is an English oak chair , c. 1690 , while the silver maple and white pine side chairs partially visible in the ford are two of only five known Boston upholstered chairs with " twist " turnings , 1665  --  1695 ( see Jonathan Fairbanks and Robert . F. New England Begins Museum of Fine Arts , Boston , 1982 , vol. 2 , p. 287 ) . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1920s from what are probably originals . The acorn shape may relate to the oak tree in the Winslow 's adopted coat of arms . // The separation from the town of Plymouth was doubtlessly facilitated by the fact that Edward Window had become governor of Plymouth Plantation , eventually serving three terms ( 1633 , 1636 , and 1644 ) . When not governor , he was almost continually a member of the General Court and deputy governor Winslow also represented both Plymouth Plantation and the neighboring Massachusetts Bay Colony in England . In 1646 , during the English Revolution , he went back to serve the cause of Oliver Cromwell ( Lord Protector ; 1653-1658 ) , and died in 1655 in the English campaign to capture the Spanish West Indies . He was buried at sea off Hispaniola . Josiah Winslow ( 1628-1680 ) , Edward Winslow 's only surviving sons inherited Careswell . Josiah rose to become almost as distinguished as his father-and much wealthier Like his father , Josiah became governor of Plymouth Colony ( 1673-1680 ) . He served as commander-in-chief of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  1676 ) -a war he was accused of precipitating by poisoning King Philip 's brother , Alexander , at Careswell . Dareswell grew . Edward Winslow had added parcels of land to the original grant , and in 1662 the estate was further enlarged . A second seventeenth-century foundation has been found next to that of Edward Windows original house . It may be from a house built by Josiah Window for his family while his mother , Susanna White Winslow ( d. 1680 ) , continued to occupy the first house until her death . Both Susanna Winslow and her son Josiah died in 1680 , and Careswell passed to Josiah 's only surviving son , Isaac ( 1671  --  1738 ) . Known as " Honor-able Isaac " for his public service as judge of the probate court and chief justice of the Court of Common Pleas at Plymouth , he was also president of the council for the Massachusetts Bay Colony and a colonel in the militia . Honorable Isaac Winslow had , perhaps , a less distinguished career than his father and grandfather , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he , who at the age of nine had inherited Careswell with its two houses , and later built the third house-the " Historic Window House " that stands today a quarter-mile north of those earlier sites . The weight and continuity of Window family tradition and the conflation of house and estate going back to 1632 can be seen in the fact that Isaac 's new house , built after Governor Edward Window and Governor Josiah Winslow were long dead , was still referred to as " the governor 's house " two generations later.6 " General John " Winslow inherited the mansion when his father , Isaac , died in 1738 , but it is unlikely that he occupied the mansion until his mother , Sarah Wensley Winslow , died in 1753 , for like many New England homesteads , the house was often tied up with rights of dower . In 1748 John Winslow , his brother Edward , and their widowed mother had signed a covenant under which they leased out the fields , the livestock , and part of the house itself , leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Parlour &; Below &; the Hall - Chamber , Book Closet dr the Closet Below in the Entry in the House with Convenient Celler Rooms and to have the pasturing ofa Horse on the Farm and have sufficient Fiering Cutt &; Fitted for the Fire at the Dore of the House . A renewal of the agreement two years later made clear what may have been a point of contention-that she further had the " Privilege of Bakeing and Cooking in the Kitchen " and " what Milk she wants for her own use . " ' John Winslow rose to the rank of major general in the British regular army serving between 1744 and 1755 in Nova Scotia , where he was second in command under the British colonel Robert Monckton ( 1726  --  1782 ) in the ethnic cleansing of the French from Acadia , of which Henry Wadsworth Longfellow ( 1807-1882 ) later wrote so poignantly in Evangeline .

" Doctor Isaac " Winslow , as he was distinguished from his grandfather , now owned the house , but did not live in it . As in the earlier case of Josiah Winslow and his dowager mother , Isaac 's stepmother , Bethiah Barker Johnson Winslow ( 1751-1790 ) , whom his father had married after his first wife 's death in 1772 , probably continued to live in the house until she died in 1790 .

The estate had been divided , leaving him less land for cash crops . Medicine was changing and practices of older physicians such as bleeding were being called into question . Also , Isaac may have squandered money remodeling the house , either when he moved in , or when he remarried . By the time he died in 1819 he was more than twenty thousand dollars in debt . In 1827 , to settle the debt , the Careswell estate and mansion were sold out of the family . 13 In 1836 the part of the estate with the mansion was purchased by Senator Daniel Webster ( 1782-1852 ) , " the Farmer of Marshfield . " Webster occupied the old Thomas house next door and used the Careswell land for crops , but his use of the venerable Window house remains unclear In October 1842 it was reported that the " Winslow Mansion , which was built one hundred and forty-seven years ago , is still standing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing , however , the visible marks of time . " 14 Webster sold Careswell in 1855 and it passed through a number of owners over the next half century Webster 's small , freestanding law office was moved onto the Historic Winslow House grounds in 1965 . In 1919 three pioneer preservationists-Edward C. Ford , John Gutterson , and Edgar B. Sherrill-purchased the derelict Winslow house from Oscar Weston and deeded it to a newly created Historic Winslow House Association , which still administers it today . Weston had lived in the house and used the ell as a barn Fifty truckloads of manure had to be removed from the building , and there are still dents in the flooring of the summer kitchen attributed to goats that were kept there.15 Nonetheless , the benign neglect the Historic Winslow House had suffered meant that it had remained essentially untouched for more than a century . Ford , Gutterson , and Sherrill hired John Baker to restore the house . Though canons of restoration have changed since those early days , the work was exemplary for its time , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changes that were made , the restoration of the 1920s is comparable to the best being done today in most cases , the changes are obvious . Windows were replaced . Where the fallen plaster in the kitchen revealed earlier squiggle-painted beams , the rest of the plaster was removed to expose the original treatment . Later fireplace surrounds were removed . Except for the kitchen , hall , the room above the hall , and service rooms like the buttery and summer kitchen , the house was restored to the mid-Georgian period . Like many historic houses , it is shown today as a building in evolution-from about 1699 through 1819 . Questions still remain concerning the actual date of the building of the Historic Window House . The earliest reference to its having been built in the seventeenth century is in a biography of Daniel Webster , which cites 1695,16 a date for which there is , unfortunately no corroboration . Later , local tradition gave the mansion a name still in common use today- " the 1699 Window House "  --  and the Historic Window House Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this dating can not be verified.17 The first known documentary reference to the house was in 1725/26 , when Honor-able Isaac deeded to General John one hundred acres of upland and meadow " a small distance from where the old house formerly stood , " implying that there was a new house elsewhere18 Beyond that , one must look to the physical evidence . In its earliest guise the Winslow House was a two-story dwelling , gabled at the sides with three bays across the front and capped by a massive pilastered chimney in the most elegant seventeenth-century manner The clapboarding is a Georgian or even Federal " improvement " ; the original siding may have been simple butted boards . The sash windows , which came down to the twentieth century , were nine-over-twelve on the rear with later , more stylish nine-over-nine and six-over-nine on the front . The lack of internal shutters suggests that there may have been leaded casement windows before the double-hung windows were installed . Photograph Pl . XI . The room above the hall , or hall chamber , is one of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , 1790  --  1810 , is maple and pine ; its cotton coverlet was probably made in New England in the late nineteenth century . The pine slant-top desk , 1780  --  1820 , has a history of ownership in the local Marshfield/Duxbury area . It is flanked by New England rush  --  seated chairs , 1780-1820 , that are rural adaptations of the urban Chippendale style , with stained maple substituted for mahogany The reproduction wallpaper , called East India , is by Waterhouse Wallhangings of Chelsea , Massachusetts , and reproduces a woodblock-printed paper attributed to the French artist Jean Pillement ( 1728-1808 ) , c. 1760. // The floor plan has the typical hall-and  --  parlor arrangement of seventeenth-century New England houses . The stairway in the narrow entryway between the hall and parlor has turned balusters and unique acorn  --  shaped finals and pendants , some believed to be original , which according to oral tradition relate to the coat of arms adopted by the Windows . This stairway and much of the rest of the house relates closely to the Bryant  --  Cushing House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Scituate ( now Norwell ) by the same master carpenter that Isaac Winslow used . Onto the original structure were grafted additions and improvements . At some point an ell including a second , " summer , " kitchen below and two rooms and storage above was attached to the original kitchen , probably during General John Winslow 's ownership . Gunstock posts ( see Pl . VII ) suggest that this ell may be older than the main house ; it may have been part of the house Josiah Winslow built in the mid-seventeenth century-or from some other local building moved onto the site . One can deduce from other physical evidence that General John Winslow probably made major renovations in the mid  --  Georgian style soon after he took possession of the house in the 1750s , and that his son Doctor Isaac did some remodeling in the Federal style after he moved in in the 1790s . Space above the present quoins suggests that pilasters had earlier ( but not necessarily originally ) graced the corners of the structure , and these pilasters may have dressed clapboards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep , fenestrated entryway in the neoclassical style was added at some point in the eighteenth century , and its corners are quoined like the corners of the house ( and were presumably added at the same time ) . The doorway is set off by fluted Done pilasters ; the pediment is decorated with dentil molding appropriate to the order , and on the tympanum is an eight-pointed star similar to inlays found on period furniture . During the twentieth-century restoration , the original fireplaces in the kitchen , hall ( now the dining room ) , and the room above the hall were uncovered . A cup found bricked into the original kitchen hearth is both remnant and confirmation of an early custom ( see Pl . VIII ) . The original fireplace in the hall proved to have an elegant curved back and a decorative fireback of herringbone brick and was surmounted by a massive pine lintel . On the other side of the house , the parlor and the room above it retain later , smaller fireplaces . Although the difference between the north and the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restoration , it is also a reminder of the division of the house when the widow Sarah Wensley Winslow lived there , between 1738 and 1753 . From the perspective of three-quarters of a century , the restoration of the Winslow House in the 1920s has historic value in itself . Like so many early twentieth-century preservationist groups , the Historic Winslow House Association sought financial support by turning to what was both currently fashionable and quaintly colonial : it added a tearoom . The seventeenth-century ell was extended with a one-story colonial revival style porch connecting the house with a nineteenth-entury barn moved to the site to house a kitchen and moderm conveniences . Tea proved to be no panacea . The colonial revival addition is used now for other functions . Today the rooms of the Historic Winslow House are interpreted as an evolution in style from the late seventeenth through the early nineteenth century , informed by the history of the Window family members who lived on the Careswell estate .
