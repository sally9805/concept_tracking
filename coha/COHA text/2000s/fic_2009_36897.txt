1 <br> I was out back of the house in the big field with my good friend Leonard Pine the afternoon it started . Me with the twelve gauge and him pulling the birds . <br> " Pull , " I said , and Leonard did , and another clay bird took to the sky and I jerked the gun up and cut it down . <br> " Man , " Leonard said , " do n't you ever miss ? " <br> " Just on purpose . " <br> I 'd switched to clay birds in favor of the real ones a long time back . I did n't like to kill anything now , but I still enjoyed the shooting . Getting the bead on something and pulling the trigger and feeling the kick on my shoulder and watching the target blow apart had its own special satisfaction . <br> " Got to open another box , " Leonard said . " The pigeons are all dead . " <br> " I 'll load , you shoot for a while . " <br> " I shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those little boogers . " <br> " I do n't care . My eye 's getting off anyway . <br> " Bullshit . " <br> Leonard got up , brushed his big black hands on his khaki pants , and came over and took the twelve gauge . He was about to load it and I was about to load the launcher , when Trudy came around the side of the house . <br> We both saw her about the same time . I turned to open another box of clay birds , and Leonard turned to pick up a box of shells , and she was swinging our way in the sunlight . <br> " Shit , " Leonard said . " Here comes trouble . " <br> Trudy was about four years younger than me , thirty-six , but she still looked twenty-six . Had that long blond hair and legs that began at the throat -- good legs that were full at the thighs and dark of skin . And she knew how to use them , had that kind of walk that worked the hips and gave her breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his car off the road for a look . She had on a tight beige sweater that showed she still did n't need a bra , and a short black skirt that was the current fashion , and it made me think of the late sixties and her mini-skirt days -- back when I met her and she was going to be a great artist and I was going to find some way to save the world . <br> Far as I knew , closest she 'd gotten to art was a drafting table and dressing mannequins in store windows , and the closest I 'd gotten to saving the world was my name on some petitions , for everything from recycling aluminum cans to saving the whales . I put my cans in the trash now , and I did n't know how the whales were doing . <br> " Watch her , " Leonard said , before she was in earshot . <br> " I 'm watching . " <br> " You know what I mean . Do n't come crying over to my place if she does it to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <br> " I know what you 're saying . " <br> " Uh-huh , and a hard dick knows no conscience . " <br> " It is n't that way and you know it . " <br> " Well , it 's some kind of way . " <br> Now that Trudy was closer , the midday sun fell full on her face , I could see she did n't quite look twenty-six . The pores in her nose were a little larger and there were crows feet around her eyes and laugh lines at the corners of her mouth . She always had liked to laugh , and she 'd laugh at anything . I remembered best how she laughed when she was happy in bed . She had a laugh then that was pretty as the song of a bird . It was the kind of thing I did n't want to remember , but the memory was there just the same , like a thorn in the back of my brain . <br> She smiled at us then , and I felt the January day become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she knew it . Liberated or not , she did n't fight that ability . <br> " Hello , Hap , " she said . <br> " Hello , " I said . <br> " Leonard , " she said . <br> " Trudy , " Leonard said . <br> " What 're you boys up to ? " <br> " Shooting some skeet , " I said . " Want to shoot some ? " <br> " Sure . " <br> Leonard handed me the shotgun . " I got to go , Hap . I 'll check you later . Remember what I told you , huh ? " <br> I looked at that hard face of his , black as a prune , said , " Sure , I 'll remember . " <br> " Un-huh . See you , Trudy , " and he went away then , making deep strides across the pasture toward the house where his car was parked . <br> " What was that all about ? " Trudy said . " He seemed kind of mad . " <br> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah , I forgot . " <br> " No you did n't . " <br> " Okay , I did n't . " <br> " You want to shoot first ? " <br> " I think I 'd really rather go in the house and have a cup of coffee . It 's kind of chilly out here . " <br> " You 're not dressed like it 's chilly . " <br> " I 've got hose on . They 're warmer than you think , Just not warm enough . Besides , I have n't seen you in a while --  " <br> " Almost two years . " <br> "  - -  and I wanted to look good . " <br> " You do . " <br> " So do you . You could gain a few pounds , but you look good . " <br> " Well , you do n't need to gain or lose an ounce . You look great . " <br> " Jazzercise . I 've got a record and I do what it says . Us older ladies have to work at it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do n't you help me gather this stuff , and we 'll go on up to the house . " <br> She sat at the kitchen table and smiled at me and made small talk . I got down the coffee and tried to keep my mind off how it used to be between us , but I was n't any good at it . <br> When I had the coffee maker going , I sat at the table across from her . It was slightly warm in the kitchen from the gas heaters , and close enough I could smell the scent of her minty soap and the hint of some perfume , probably dabbed behind the ears and knees and below her belly button . That 's the way she used to do it , and the thought of it made me weak . <br> " Still working in the rose fields ? " she asked . <br> " We 've been digging them , but not for the last few days . The man me and Leonard work for is through with that part . It 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else . " <br> She nodded , ran one long-nailed hand through her hair , and I saw the glint of a small , gold loop in her earlobe . I do n't know what it was about that gesture , about the wink of gold , but it made me want to take her in my arms , pull her on the table and make the two-year absence of her blow away . <br> Instead I contented myself with a memory , one of my favorites . It was about the time we went to this dance and she had worn this zebra-stripped blouse and mini-skirt . I was twenty-three and she was nineteen . The way she danced , the way she moved when she was n't dancing , the smell of her , had made me manic with lust . <br> I had whispered something to her and she had laughed and we had gone out to my Chevy and driven to our favorite parking place on a pine-covered hill . I stripped her and she stripped me , and we made slow , sweet love on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on us like a personal love-light , the cool summer breeze blowing across us like a feathered fan . <br> And the thing I remember best about that time , other than the act of copulation , was I had felt so goddamn strong and immortal . Old age and death were as wild and improbable as some drunken story about walking across the face of a star . <br> " How 's . . . what is it ? Howard ? " It was n't a thing I really wanted to ask , but it came out anyway . <br> " Okay . We 're divorced . Have been for a year now . I do n't think I 'm cut out for marriage . I had you and I screwed that up , did n't I ? " <br> " No great loss . " <br> " I left you for Pete and Pete for Bill and Bill for Howard . None of them worked out , and neither did the ones I did n't marry along the way . None of them came close to what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you are harder and harder to find . " <br> The flattery was a little thick , so I did n't have anything to say to it . I checked the coffee , poured a couple of cups . When I sat hers on the table , she looked at me , and I started to say something brotherly , but it would n't come out . <br> " I 've missed you , Hap , " she said . " I really have . " <br> I put my coffee cup on the table next to hers and she stood and I held her and we kissed . The earth did n't move and my heart did n't stop , but it was quite all right just the same . <br> Then we had our hands all over each other , and we started moving toward the bedroom , molting clothes along the way . Under the covers we danced the good , slow dance , and she let loose with that laugh I loved so much , the one as sweet and happy as the song of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then that even the most predatory of birds , the shrike , can sing . <br> 2 <br> About two in the morning the phone rang . I got up , and went to the kitchen to answer it . I do n't think Trudy even heard it . <br> It was Leonard . <br> " That bitch there ? " <br> " Yeah . " <br> " Shit . You 're fucked again . " <br> " It 's different this time . I 'm only getting laid . Remember what you said about a hard dick not knowing a conscience ? You were right . " <br> " Bullshit , do n't give me that macho crap . I was just talking that way . You do n't think like that and you know it . It 's always got to be something to you . This is Leonard you 're talking to here , Mr. Hap Collins , not some rose field nigger . " <br> " Leonard , you are a rose field nigger , and so am I. I 'm a white version . " <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are you doing up at two in the morning minding my business ? " <br> " Drinking , goddammit . Trying to get drunk . " <br> " How are you doing ? " <br> " I 'd rate it about a five on a one-to-ten scale . " <br> " Is that Hank Williams I hear in the background ? " <br> " Not his ownself , but yes . ' Setting the Woods On Fire . ' " <br> " What key 's he singing in ? " <br> " You 're not as funny as you think , Hap . Shit , I wish that whore would n't come around . " <br> " Do n't call her that . " <br> " That 's what she is . She comes around and you start to act funny . " <br> " How funny do I get ? " <br> " All moon-eyed and puppylike , talking about the good old days , giving me that self-righteous sixties stuff . I was there , buddy , and it was just the eighties with tie-dyed Tee-shirts . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixties just as much as I do . " <br> " But I hated them . Shit , man , Trudy gets you all out of perspective . She gets to telling you how it was and how it ought to be now , and you get to believing her . I like you cynical . It 's closer to the ground . I tell you , that bitch will say anything to get her way . She 's fake as pro-wrestling . She 's out there on a limb , brother , and she 's inviting you out there with her . When the limb cracks , you 're both gon na bust your ass . Get down from the tree , Hap . " <br> " She 's all right , Leonard . " <br> " In the sack , maybe . In the head , uh-uh . " <br> " No , she 's all right . " <br> " Sure , and wow , the sixties , man , like neat . " <br> " This time is different . " <br> " And next time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodnight , you dumb sonofabitch . " <br> He hung up , and I went over and got a glass out of the cabinet , filled it with water , drank it , leaned my naked rear into the counter and thought about things . What I thought about mostly was how cold it was . <br> I went back to the bedroom to get my robe , and looked down at Trudy . There was enough moonlight that I could see her face . The blanket had fallen off of her and she was lying on her side with her arms cuddling her pillow . I could see a smooth shoulder , the shape of one fine breast and the curve of her hip . Looked too innocent to have been the one in my bed a short time ago , screaming and groaning , and finally singing like a bird . <br> But she did n't look so innocent I was n't stirred . I thought about waking her , but did n't . I covered her gently , got my robe off the bedpost , went back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a chair at the table across from the window and looked out . With the curtains pulled back like they were , I could see the moonlit field where Leonard and I had shot skeet , could see the line of pines behind it , looking oddly enough like the outline of a distant mountain range . <br> I sat there and drank my water and thought about things , thought about Trudy and the sixties and what Leonard had said , and knew he was right . Last time she had come around and gone away , I had started on a monumental drunk that embarrassed the winos down at the highway mission , which was where Leonard found me -- three months later . I had no idea where I had gotten the money for liquor , and I did n't know how much I 'd drunk , could n't even remember having started . <br> Since that time I had sworn off . Trudy , not the liquor . But now she was in my house again , in my bed , and I was thinking about her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fallen off the wagon again . <br> Until it had gone wrong between us ( and it was a mystery to me as to when and how ) , our relationship had been as beautiful as a dream . And there were times when I felt it might have been just that . <br> We met at LaBorde University . I had made a late start due to no money and lots of hard work at the iron foundry trying to get me some . The foundry was a hot , horrible job where you wore a hard hat , watched sparks jump and heard the clang of steel pipe all day . <br> But it was money , and I thought it would allow me to go to college , get some kind of degree and find a way to make an easier living than my old man had ; a way for me to get my slice of the American Dream . <br> Pretty soon I was wrapped up in the learning , though , and not for what it could get me financially . There was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page and the martial arts I practiced , the color article section of the TV Guide . There was more to life than a beer with the buddies , a gold watch and a pension . It was the sixties , a time of love and peace and social upheaval -- contradictions that walked side by side . Women 's rights . Civil rights . The Vietnam War . I got it in my head I could do some good out there , make things better for the underprivileged . I changed my major from business to sociology and went to anti-war rallies and sang some folk songs , collected Beatles albums , and let my hair grow long . <br> Continues ...
