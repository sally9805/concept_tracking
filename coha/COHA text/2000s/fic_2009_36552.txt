I <br> I 'm dead , Sam thinks . Simple as that . <br> For months they 'd been warned of kamikaze attacks and , initially , nothing happened . Then one day he ran down from the bridge , heard the batteries open fire and the whine of an approaching plane . He saw it , recognized the charcoal silhouette against the milky sky . A Zero . It came in low , its wings toggling through the antiaircraft blasts till it veered and disappeared behind the starboard railing . <br> He wakes and looks about , at the bare walls of his bedroom , then grabs a fistful of sheet and takes a moment to get his bearings . A dream . The dream . The same damn dream these fifty-seven years , the memory burned so deep that most nights his mind ca n't avoid it . Always he wakes terrified , but comforted , too . There 's the terror , but it 's the same terror . <br> Sam sits up , playing out the history , a memory now , a waking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hospital ship . He learned that the Japanese pilot missed his destroyer but crashed into the sea close enough to shake the ship like a bath toy . Twelve men went overboard ; five were rescued . Sam stayed on deck , but cracked two vertebrae . For eleven weeks he lay paralyzed . I 'm dead , he thought again . Back home , in a VA hospital in Detroit , the doctors fused the two vertebrae together , and most of the rest . Six days after the operation , he regained feeling . In that moment , when he realized that the world would come back to him , he felt dizzy , weightless , not a person at all . Life now seemed a surprise , an unopened gift . Soon he could walk , but with limitations ; his back was rigid as a two-by-four , his neck so stiff that he could only look straight ahead . For this the navy would send him a small monthly disability check . How odd , Sam thought . One moment you 're dead , the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rabbi in two hours , so he shaves , a two-part process , first with the cream and blade , then , once his face has had a chance to dry , with the electric razor , which makes that odd hum when it finds a patch of whiskers he missed with the blade . He 's seen old men who shave themselves badly , leaving sloppy patches of gray stubble , signs of incompetence or  --  even worse  --  apathy . It 's the little things that matter now , the small acts of defiance that bring dignity in the face of all the deterioration . He has decided that if there 's any meaning to life , it 's to be found in the daily struggles . <br> Two squirrels are bickering outside his window , making a racket that could be mistaken for birds . Daily struggles . They know it , too . <br> He dresses in a dark suit , funereal as fits the occasion , and slips his dog tags into his pants pocket . He likes the feeling of them there , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll know exactly who he is . <br> His son soon will have been dead for one year , and Sam wants to recognize this , as per the Jewish tradition . He has no others . That Kyle has been taken from him , that he simply disappeared  --  this is something that no father should endure . He understands now the look his own father gave him when Sam shipped off to war , and also why he looked away when Sam came back , paralyzed , weighing 126 pounds . The suffering of a child is horrible ; of one 's own it is unthinkable . And so Sam has turned to his faith , though he doubts he has ever truly believed , even when he lay in that hospital bed and did n't know if he would move again , or again almost fifty years later when they cut his chest open . Faith has always eluded him . The rituals of faith , though , may still prove useful . <br> He drives to the temple , navigating his Lincoln down the bright streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific . Midweek there are but a few cars in the temple 's lot , just the old sedans and econo-boxes of those who work in religion  --  at least the Jewish religion . Inside , the air is still , the lighting dim . There are pictures on the wall of an old temple in Brooklyn , displaced here to California , like the Dodgers . Down the hall he sees light and heads for it . <br> The rabbi is a tall man with coarse black hair , thick dark eyebrows , glasses to match . Gauss . " Like the math- ematician , " Sam said on the phone , to which the rabbi replied , " Exactly . " Sam took it as a good sign . The real Gauss was perhaps the most brilliant man of his time , maybe of all time , and Sam respects anyone who has heard his name , unusual now in this era of good-looks idolatry and the worship of anyone who can shout into a microphone and call it music . Sam sits before Rabbi Gauss 's heavy wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is struck with the same thought he had the last time he met a rabbi : how is it that such a learned man can have faith ? It 's a mystery to Sam , and yet here he is . <br> " So , Mr. Miller , " says Rabbi Gauss . " You want to recognize your son 's yahrzeit . " <br> " Exactly . " <br> " Have you been to our temple before ? " <br> " No . " <br> " How long have you lived in Santa Barbara ? " <br> " About fifteen years , " Sam says . <br> " Have you been to any temple , or , should I say , when was the last time ? " <br> Sam thinks about this . " Nixon was president . " <br> The rabbi , bless him , is amused . " Nixon ? So at least thirty years , " he says . <br> " My mother died back then , of heart failure . My father , too . " Sam 's eye catches a shaft of light coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> " So now you have lost a son , and you are back . " <br> " Guilty as charged , Rabbi . You know , I look at your books and think , I could love Judaism , were it not for the religion . I 'll be honest , I never feel less Jewish than when I 'm in a temple . The Hebrew prayers , the responsive reading , even the idea of God . I struggle with it all . My father , who really only spoke Yiddish well , he used to take me to temple on Yom Kippur , when I was a boy , this was in the twenties , and when he 'd had enough of the service , we 'd go up the street to a coffee shop and have ham and cheese sandwiches . Ham and cheese : he thought this was one of the great things about America . " <br> It occurs to Sam that his story might be offensive to a rabbi . This one does n't look offended ; there 's something to be said for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " he still went to temple . He found something of value there . " <br> " Tell me about your son , " the rabbi says . <br> " A fascinating young man . Very smart and , what do they say nowadays , intense . He worked on Wall Street . On the morning of September eleventh he had a meeting in the north tower . He went in and was never heard from again . " <br> The rabbi takes off his glasses to rub his eyes , which are surprisingly blue . <br> " For a time I hoped against hope . There was no body . I sat no shivah , held no funeral , but after a time I had to face the truth . " <br> The rabbi nods , puts his glasses back on . <br> " Most of the people who are important to me are dead , " Sam says . " And soon , I will be , too . Till then I want to remember the dead . I wish I 'd done it all along ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them back . And I want to bring my daughter out to teach her how to do this . I 've taught her nothing about death , but her mother is dead , her brother is dead . Soon , her father will be dead , and she will be alone . This may be the one thing left I can teach her that will do her some good . " <br> " Your children 's mother ? " <br> " Dead , in 1975 . " <br> " She was Jewish ? " asks the rabbi . <br> " No . " <br> " So your children are not really Jewish . " <br> " Do they have to be ? " <br> " Not at all , " says Rabbi Gauss . " But you are . I will make you a deal . I will read your son 's name on the yahrzeit , a son who was not Jewish . You will attend High Holy Day services this year . " <br> " To feel less Jewish , " Sam says . <br> " Maybe you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rabbi . " <br> " Of course , " the rabbi says . " It 's my business . " <br> Sam drives home beneath the milky sky , happy with the outcome . He needs to call Cat , never an easy thing . If Sam were like everyone else , he 'd have a cell phone , but he has resisted this convenience  --  if it is that . Always to be in contact seems more a curse than a blessing , and besides , the buttons on those phones are small and difficult to operate . Every year things get a little more difficult , the indignities a little greater . He is eighty , with a replaced hip , a triple bypass , a system pumped so full of this and that medication that he ca n't say anymore what they are all for , knows only that he 's still breathing . Sometimes he wants to stop people on the street and say , " I was a young man once , full of vim and vigor . I won a war , founded a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know things . " Of course , they 'd think he was crazy . <br> Continues ...
