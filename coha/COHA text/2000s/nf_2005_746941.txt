Hightech tests  --  simpler , cheaper , faster . <p> By developing new detection techniques and processes that incorporate principles from many different scientific disciplines , Agricultural Research Service scientists in Wyndmoor , Pennsylvania , are improving food safety . <p> Regulatory agencies and the food industry need fast , automated , cost-effective analytical methods that are accurate , reliable , and safe and that minimize waste . Several of the research unit 's chemists are using advanced technologies to develop methods to screen , detect , and confirm multiple chemical residues  --  such as veterinary drugs and pesticides  --  and pathogenic bacteria and their toxins in food products . <p> Shu-I Tu , research leader of the Microbial Biophysics and Residue Chemistry Research Unit at the Eastern Regional Research Center , oversees development of such techniques . He says the laboratory works with state-of-the-art scientific instrumentation and biosensor-based methods that can detect chemical signals and provide information about specific biological activities . <p> " Many procedures we use have been modified from diagnostic systems used for medical analysis , " Tu says . " We are taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> One method they use , fluorescence spectroscopy , involves recording optical spectra from molecules absorbing and emitting light . There are several ways to attach highly fluorescent probes to make biological targets  --  such as pathogenic bacteria  --  glow . Fluorescence spectroscopic methods , which rely on monitoring changes in the wavelengths and intensity of the signal , have been used for decades . Researchers use changes in the emission spectrum to achieve valuable insight into the concentration and behavior of the emitting molecules . <p> Detecting low levels of protein or DNA targets in or on a sample is sometimes difficult and prone to errors because specific fluorescence signals can be low or masked by interferences . One approach to improve detection and isolate the desired spectroscopic signal is to use what 's known as time-resolved fluorescence ( TRF ) and luminescence ( TRL ) reagents . Time-resolved spectroscopic techniques help reduce background noise and increase sensitivity . Scientists Monitor Food for Residues <p> Some veterinary drugs are not approved for use in food-producing animals . Others , such as beta-lactam antibiotics , have tolerance levels  --  maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain in or on food commodities  --  established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Time-consuming and laborious methods are currently used for regulatory purposes to ensure that these drugs are not present in samples . <p> Chemist Guoying Chen has developed a prototype of a portable , suitcase-sized device to detect contaminants , such as tetracycline antibiotics , in meat , milk , and fish . The 25-pound prototype was designed for regulatory-agency investigators to take directly to a site for field analysis . Its user-friendly custom software is already completed and will run in a Microsoft Windows environment . <p> The filter-based fluorometer uses TRL to detect trace amounts of target chemicals by removing interference from fluorescent background signals given off by other organic substances present in a meat sample . The system requires 1-5 g of meat from which to extract the antibiotics present and concentrate them into liquid solution . Testing can be conducted on site and results provided on the spot . A quick change of filters allows the user to move from one targeted drug to another . The device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at slaughterhouses , and it could be used to check for contaminants in liquids , such as milk , water , or urine . <p> Marilyn Schneider , another chemist in the research unit , is interested in analyzing animal-derived foods for veterinary drug residues . She is developing assays using natural fluorescence , as well as TRF , to screen for the presence of fluorescent antibiotics . Schneider takes advantage of the fluorescence of a fluoroquinolone antibiotic called enrofloxacin to first screen muscle extracts for its presence . After two reagents are added to this solution , the same sample can be screened for tetracycline antibiotics , eliminating the need for a separate extraction . <p> In another approach , Schneider and Chen use a buffer to extract samples from chicken , clean the samples by solid phase extraction , add TRL reagents , and then measure the samples for tetracyclines using TRL . <p> " These screening assays are alternatives to biological assays used by regulatory agencies , " Schneider says . " The fluorescence assay is very rapid and detects the drugs when they are at or above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but have greater sensitivity . " <p> Chemist Steven Lehotay , along with a previously visiting scientist , Michelangelo Anastassiades , developed the QuEChERS method , which stands for " quick , easy , cheap , effective , rugged , and safe " and is pronounced " catchers . " The streamlined approach makes it easier and less expensive for analytical chemists to examine fruits and vegetables for pesticide residues . Lehotay says the method reduces procedural steps  --  and that lessens the chance for a mistake . A single , easy-to-clean Teflon tube is the only item to be washed and reused , eliminating all the glassware used in conventional methods . Furthermore , less than 10 mL of solvent waste is generated  --  much less than the 75-450 mL generated by other methods . <p> " Several monitoring laboratories , including a few in FDA , are evaluating QuEChERS for use in routine monitoring and other approaches designed to safeguard the food supply , " Lehotay says . He and colleagues are now working to adapt the concept to analyze meats for veterinary drugs . <p> Chemist Keith Fagerquist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a method to measure and confirm beta-lactam antibiotics in pork and cattle kidney tissue . The method  --  which uses liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry  --  is fast and looks for multiple residues in tissue samples , where antibiotics tend to concentrate the most . Methods Detect Pathogens and Toxins in Food <p> Antibodies are protein molecules that bind to antigens  --  such as bacteria  --  and remove them from the body . Researchers can use antibodies to isolate pathogens or chemicals in food products as well . <p> Andrew Gehring , another chemist in the unit , is working with Tu on a procedure that combines immunomagnetic capture with TRF to simultaneously detect Escherichia coli and Salmonella in ground beef , ground turkey , alfalfa sprouts , and seeds . The procedure uses magnetic beads that are coated with pathogen-specific antibodies . The antibodies bind to the bacteria , and the magnetism pulls them out of complex mixtures of food . Once extracted , the bacteria can be more easily detected . <p> Gehring is also developing a luminescence-based method coupled with an ELISA ( enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ) to detect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive laboratory test that uses antibodies and enzymes to detect and measure specific antigens in samples . Gehring 's test can be completed in 8 hours and can detect 1-10 bacteria per gram of ground meat . USDA 's Food Safety Inspection Service ( FSIS ) would ultimately like to be able to detect 1 bacterium in 25 grams of meat . <p> Chemist Marjorie Medina developed a biosensor immunoassay using surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) to detect Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin A ( SEA ) and B ( SEB )  --  toxins that cause gastroenteritis  --  in foods such as ham , milk , and eggs . Conventional heating and processing kills the bacterium but not its toxins . Bacteria produce toxins under stressful conditions , such as when they are too crowded or denied food or when they 're fighting back against antibiotics . <p> " SPR uses light reflected off thin metal films , " Medina explains . " Toxin molecules in the sample bind to the sensor surface , and the refractive index at the surface changes . The time it takes for a response from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any , is actually present in the food sample . " <p> Medina says that FSIS is interested in an alternative to the conventional method to detect enterotoxins in whole eggs . Her semi-automated method has several advantages over other methods and may detect multiple bacterial toxins in a single food sample . <p> Medina also developed a latex particle agglutination assay for detection of SEA and SEB that causes the toxins to clump together . The method takes advantage of an antibody 's ability to bind to a unique antigen in pathogen cells . The assay is simpler to use than other methods and can detect as little as 10 parts per billion of toxin per gram of sample . <p> This research is part of Food Safety ( Animal and Plant Products ) , an ARS National Program ( #108 ) described on the World Wide Web at www.nps.ars.usda.gov . <p> Shu-I Tu is in the USDA-ARS Microbial Biophysics and Residue Chemistry Research Unit , Eastern Regional Research Center , 600 East Mermaid Ln. , Wyndmoor , PA 19038-8598 ; phone ( 215 ) 233-6466 , fax ( 215 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) : Chemist Steve Lehotay prepares extracts of fruits and vegetables for analysis of pesticide residues . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : To detect E. coli O157:H7 in foods , chemist Shu-I Tu and microbiologist Marsha Golden use immunomagnetic capture and time-resolved fluorescence . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Chemist Marjorie Medina prepares egg samples for analysis of Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins by surface plasmon resonance . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Chemist Andy Gehring inserts a meat sample into a luminometer to check for the presence of bacteria as technician Sue Reed prepares other samples for analysis . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Chemists Marilyn Schneider and Alan Lightfield analyze veterinary drug data from the liquid chromatograph/tandem mass spectrometer . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The tube held by technician Sheri Mazenko contains concentrated immunomagnetic beads coated with antibodies that bind to specific bacteria , making it possible to detect contaminants in food . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Chemist Guoying Chen tests a portable fluorometer he designed and built to screen for drug residues in food extracts . <p> By Jim Core , ARS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
