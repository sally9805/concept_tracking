Saturn is one of the best known planets . Yet it 's also one of the most mysterious . Now a spacecraft looks at this amazing ring world . // Have you ever wondered what it would be like to soar through Saturn 's rings ? A robot spacecraft recently got the chance to do that . It is named Cassini . Last June , Cassini arrived near Saturn . The spacecraft had spent more than seven years speeding through space . It had traveled more than 2.2 million miles . Now Cassini faced the most dangerous part of its mission . Cassini arrived below Saturn 's rings . It had to fly through them . The rings are made of millions of chunks of ice and ice-covered rock . Some pieces are the size of a grain of sand . But others are as big as a house . Could Cassini avoid a collision ? Luckily , Cassini made it through the rings without a scratch . The spacecraft then started to orbit , or go around , Saturn . Cassini is n't the first spacecraft to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1981 . But it did n't hang around for long . After snapping hundreds of photos , it zoomed away . Cassini , on the other hand , is n't going anywhere else . It is set to orbit Saturn for the next four years . The mission may even last longer . There 's a lot that scientists want to learn about Saturn and its moons ! A Gas Giant Saturn is the second largest planet in our solar system . A planet is a large object that orbits a star . Only Jupiter is bigger . Saturn is so large that 750 Earth-size planets could be placed inside it . Like its larger neighbor , Saturn is made of gases . All we see on Saturn are clouds of gas . However , a small solid core may be buried deep below those cloud tops . The gases in Saturn 's atmosphere may look calm . They are n't . They swirl around the sky . Clouds , tornadoes , and hurricanes whip around Saturn . At the equator , winds can reach a thousand miles an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its beautiful rings . However , it is not the only planet that has rings . Three other planets-Jupiter , Uranus , and Neptune-also have rings . But those rings are much thinner and harder to spot . From far away , Saturn 's rings look almost like a single , perfect bracelet . But up close , things are much different . The planet actually has about a thousand different rings . Some of them are even braided together . Tiny moonlets orbit alongside some of the rings . Their gravity may help keep the rings together . Without the moonlets , particles that make up the rings might float away . Meet the Moons At the start of this year , Saturn had 33 known moons . Cassini discovered two of them last summer . They do n't have names yet . Scientists still have much to learn about Saturn 's moons . Most of them are pretty small . Only five , in fact , are more than 600 miles across . Earth 's moon , in comparison , is 2,500 miles across . Cassini is giving us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moons like ? Enceladus is one of the shiniest objects in our solar system . Its icy surface reflects lots of light from the sun . Mimas has a huge crater . It 's 80 miles wide and 6 miles deep . The crater covers nearly a third of the moon 's surface . Tethys has long , deep trenches . It also has tiny moonlets . Imagine , a moon with moons . Moon of Mystery The most amazing moon is Titan . It is the second largest moon in our solar system . And it may be the most fantastic . A thick atmosphere covers Titan . The air is mostly nitrogen gas . Some scientists think that life may exist on Titan 's surface . To find out , Cassini is giving the moon extra attention . The spacecraft looked closely at Titan last October . Cassini gave us our first glimpse of the moon 's surface . Cassini saw dark streaks over part of the giant moon . What caused them ? The answer may be blowing in the wind . Perhaps strong winds moved material across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Titan . They might be lakes . If so , they 're not full of water . Titan is too cold for liquid water . Instead the lakes may be filled with liquid methane . On Earth , methane is normally a gas . The Mission Continues Scientists still want to learn more about Titan . The pictures that Cassini snapped do not show many details . One lake looks like a large cat head . Other features look either light or dark . Scientists want a closer look at the surface . That 's why Cassini brought a tiny spacecraft to Saturn . It is named Huygens . The ship was designed to land on Titan . After a bumpy ride , Huygens reached Titan on January 14 . Then it began gathering information-lots of it . The spacecraft studied both the surface and the atmosphere . It found many rivers on the moon 's surface . Cassini has just begun its great adventure . We do n't know what amazing discoveries it will make . Perhaps one day , people will follow the spacecraft to Saturn .
