You can forgive Pepsi chairman Roger Enrico for bubbling over with enthusiasm last week as he announced the company 's $13 billion purchase of food-and-drink giant Quaker Oats . Pepsi , as second fiddle to archrival Coke in the cola wars , does n't get that many chances to declare victory . So Enrico , who has recently put some fizz back in the company , was n't about to pass up this rare opportunity . " We are the category captain , 1 1/2 times the size of the next largest player , " he declared . <P> The runner-up in this case , of course , is Coke , but Enrico was n't referring to the $58 billion U.S. soda business . Instead , he was talking about the nearly $20 billion emerging market for alternative beverages , those ubiquitous juices , teas , bottled waters , sports and energy drinks , packed with exotic herbs and vitamins , that are overwhelming store shelves . Quaker may be known for oatmeal , but its magic potion is Gatorade , a $2 billion-a-year dynamo of a brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When we 're done , " Gatorade chief Susan Wellington told analysts earlier this year , " tap water will be relegated to showers and washing dishes . " Coming on the heels of Pepsi 's recent $370 million purchase of SoBe , the hottest of the New Age tonics , the Gatorade deal was Enrico 's crowning achievement , effectively solidifying Pepsi 's dominance in the fastest-growing segment of the drinks business . " In this area , " says Emanuel Goldman , an analyst at ING Barings , " the tables are turned . " <P> As it happens , the whole business is turning . Last year , for the first time in decades , Americans ' consumption of carbonated soft drinks actually declined . Sodas still command the biggest share of sips in the U.S. , but it 's the entrepreneurial upstarts like SoBe , Nantucket Nectars , Fresh Samantha and Honest Tea that are making people thirsty . While the nonbubbly business is growing almost 10% a year  --  and bottled water is chugging along at a rapid , 30% clip  --  sodas have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices , now account for more than half of all industry growth , according to Sanford Bernstein &; Co . No wonder , then , that every beverage maker is feverishly working to come up with cola alternatives that promise to be healthy , not just refreshing . Norm Snyder , COO of SoBe , says , " Before , the big boys were just watching from the sidelines , but now they 're betting on it with their dollars . " <P> And how . Earlier this fall Cadbury-Schweppes , the British owner of Dr Pepper and Seven-Up , spent $1.45 billion to gulp down juice-and-tea leader Snapple . " The ingredients in carbonated soft drinks are essentially the same as they 've always been . You can only add a little bit of flavor to them , " says Todd Stitzer , Cadbury 's chief strategy officer , of the deal .
