This special issue of MEJ explores how music teacher education programs can help preservice music teachers prepare for their careers <p> I first proposed this special issue to the editorial committee of the Music Educators Journal shortly after attending the June 2001 event . Music Education for This Century : A Working Institute for Change and Innovation in Our Profession , sponsored by MENC and the College Music Society and held at Northwestern University in Evansville , Indiana . I was fortunate to have been a participant and part of the facilitating process , but I left the meeting feeling frustrated by the seeming monumentality of the task of reforming music teacher education . The need for music education students to acquire an overwhelming amount of musical information and pedagogical skill , the demands of various accrediting agencies , and the force of accumulated traditions made any kind of fundamental change in teacher preparation seem nearly impossible . The very thought of transforming music teacher education into a program that reflected current and emerging sociological , psychological , and philosophical perspectives seemed numbing . <p> Many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run counter to the prevailing methods and ensemble traditions that characterize our education programs today . Furthermore , as David <p> Teachout has observed , our current professional culture provides few rewards for the " successful music teacher . " but many for the successful " music director . " 1 Transformation seemed out of the question ; the current system , unassailable . Potential for Change <p> Despite these challenges , we may have reached a point where significant action can occur . At both its September 2005 Symposium of Music Teacher Education at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and MENCs April 2006 National Biennial Conference in Salt Lake City , the Society of Music Teacher Education ( SMTE ) began addressing some crucial topics in teacher education , especially in the areas of recruitment , retention , and curriculum . <p> Shortly after the institute at Northwestern , an article by Sharon Feiman-Nemser 2 on designing a learning continuum from preparation to practice crossed my desk . I was struck by Feiman-Nemser 's vision of a curriculum that connected the ways teachers learn over time . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but one part of the larger concerns of the entire field of teacher education . We are not alone . <p> Of special interest was Feiman-Nemser 's focus on teacher learning within a reform-minded context and her articulation of the central tasks that the preparation , induction , and early professional development phases of teacher learning should accomplish . Her discussion seemed to capture the possibility of a teachers professional development program that could be so much richer than the programs usually crafted after various constituencies stake claims , and institutional policy choices and arrangements play themselves out . <p> After reading Feiman-Nemser 's article , I thought a similar set of music teacher education think pieces dedicated to constructing auricular experiences predicated on the idea of teachers as learners might capture the attention of researchers , practitioners , music teacher educators , and administrators , as well as prospective music teachers themselves . Rather than take an expansive perspective , as Feiman-Nemser had done in her article , I thought we might fix our view on the preservice program of music teacher learning and education . ( Music teacher induction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Given this prospect , identifying a few important arenas for discussion might allow us to articulate our goals and elaborate on processes for achieving those goals . Teachers as Learners <p> Any consciously constructed educational program attempts to create a learning environment with certain ends in view . As Charles Leonhard and Robert W. House observed years ago , an educational program is not the collection of courses a student takes or the participation in musical organizations that are offered. 3 Rather , the substance of an educational program lies in the experiences that students have , the configurations of activities and the selection of materials provided , and the various contexts in which learning occurs . Yet , before these substantive matters can be addressed , it is perhaps crucial to consider first the learning needs of the prospective music teachers who are in , and who are just entering , our programs . <p> A focus on the learning needs of preservice teachers may be more radical than it seems at first glance . As Feiman-Nemser suggests , " placing serious and sustained teacher learning " at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching and learning . " 4 To envision preservice teachers as learners may indeed require a cultural transformation in the way colleges , university music schools , and public schools routinely think about music education curricula and operate teacher education programs . For some , coming to think of the teacher as learner ( as compared to the teacher as technician or the teacher as dispenser of information ) may be a big enough change to classify it as an end in itself . A similar transformation would be in order if we were to envision the teaching and learning of music as a lived gestalt 5 rather than the accumulation and amalgamation of discrete tasks and concepts . Embracing new metaphors can transform our vision and illuminate a lifetime 's work , if we allow it to do so. 6 Defining Good Teaching <p> No program structure or content can be discussed without some kind of vision of good teaching and what we want a good music educator to be . The amount of literature in teacher education , including music teacher education literature , is staggering. 7 A review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers shows a vast array of thought , including competing schools of thought . The most current educational ideas do provide some guidance , however . ( See the Suggested Reading list for some of the recent literature on these ideas . ) <p> Most reform proposals in the literature , including those often referred to as " best practices , " call for learning environments rich in problem-solving opportunities that require critical and analogical thinking and that build connections to everyday life . Also emphasized is the recognition that knowledge construction and human understanding are embedded in personal histories that incorporate dynamic social and cultural contexts . Much of the current educational literature related to subject matter standards and goals promotes teaching models advancing holistic conceptions of engagement , as well as varied ways to exhibit understanding within and across disciplines . Exemplars of practice that focus on encouraging learner analysis and reflection - not just acquisition or imitation - are , however , still necessary . In short , current educational thought and innovative teaching practice mirror a postmodern view of human reality situated in localized and community contexts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Celebrating the Vision <p> The four articles in this special focus issue of the Music Educators Journal celebrate an expansive and invigorating vision of music teacher education at the preservice phase of teacher learning . As you read each article , you are likely to sense several leitmotifs or variations on a set of central themes . This is intentional . The overarching themes explored in this issue have been outlined above , yet each article takes a different aspect of the music teacher education program and addresses fundamental curricular concerns and issues related to that area of preservice teacher learning . Each author offers in-depth , far-reaching ideas and practical suggestions for creating a curriculum oriented around a vision of teacher as learner and teaching as learning . <p> Although it may now seem clich , what may be of greatest help in thinking about the preparation of music teachers in the twenty-first century is to do more things differently with less . Program expansion and greater specialization may not be viable alternatives . Rather , doing more with less may mean working within the structures we have and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean initiating a shift in the way we as music teacher educators think about and facilitate the learning of those who are becoming music teachers . These articles are but one step in the process of change . Suggested Reading <p> The following resources offer insight into some of the current ideas promoted by educational reformers .
