COMPUTERS // A few months ago , Apple introduced a new computer built around its G5 64-bit processor-and a brash new marketing campaign for it . Apple claimed it was " the world 's fastest personal computer . " A bold claim . So bold , in fact , that we could hardly let it go without further scrutiny . In a 2-page ad , reproduced here , the computer maker said the dual 2-GHz G5 was the world 's fastest personal computer . Apple published industry standard benchmarks to prove it . In tests , the G5 fared very well against a Dell Precision 650 system with a dual 3.06-GHz Xeon processor and a Dell Dimension 8300 with a single 3-GHz Pentium 4 , according to the ad . But almost immediately , people started crying foul . Charges flew across the Internet that the independent company performing the test , VeriTest , had crippled the PC . Was the Apple G5 the world 's fastest ? Or were the tests rigged ? That question kept gnawing at us , so we decided to conduct our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first 64-bit desktop processor . That means it can handle code in 64-bit chunks , twice that of other desktop processors on the market . While most software is optimized for 32-bit processors , 64-bit software can run much faster . This is important because for years , Apple suffered from the " Gigahertz Gap . " Its CPUs were considered slower than Intel 's chips . When the G5 debuted amid the hoopla , Apple wanted to show off how fast it was . Standardized benchmarks were its key marketing tools . Our plan was to obtain a dual 2-GHz G5 system from Apple and a dual 3.06-GHz Xeon system from Hewlett-Packard and run the tests ourselves . We ran into our first problem on the PC side . HR frankly , dragged its feet in providing us with a loaner unit . Members of the PR team hemmed and hawed , attempting to divine our intentions before finally agreeing to provide an xw6000 workstation with dual 3.2-GHz processors , 2GB of RAM and a 36GB hard drive . They also souped up the graphics card with an nVidia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XP operating system . This was a problem . The graphics card HP was giving us was one of the best on the market , but there was no way to tell if this graphics card had been installed in the machine used by VeriTest . The HP processors we had were significantly faster than the ones in the ad . This meant we were no longer comparing the same systems as in the advertisement . The Apple system came with dual 2-GHz G5 processors , 2GB of RAM , a 160GB hard drive and an ATI Radeon 9800 Pro graphics card ( with 128MB of VRAM ) . It ran the latest iteration of Mac OS X-Panther , or 10.3 . This setup , too , was a problem for the testing because VeriTest performed its tests using prototype eguipment under OS X 10.2 without the higher-end graphics card . Here again , we were n't getting the same machine that was used in the ad . Both companies were attempting to stack the deck in their favor . Their Tests VeriTest , headquartered in Waltham , Mass. , used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benchmarks , considered an industry standard . In the ad , Apple said the G5 scored 16.9 on the SPECintrate 2000 test , which performs an integer calculation , and 15.8 on the SPECfprate 2000 test , which performs a floating-point calculation . In both tests , the G5 beat the Xeon ( with 16.7 and 11.1 for each test , respectively ) and the Pentium 4 ( which scored 10.3 and 4.81 , respectively ) . The published benchmarks soon sparked controversy . Charges flew that Apple had stacked the tests in its favor , and Apple 's Vice President of Hardware , Greg Joswiak , defended the company 's claims in various media outlets . VeriTest said it used an Apple-supplied tool to adjust the G5 processor to " enable memory Read Bypass " and to " enable the maximum of eight hardware pre-fetch streams and disable software-based pre-fetching , " as outlined in its online documentation . VeriTest also installed a " high-performance , single-threaded malloc library , " which is geared for speed rather than efficiency . VeriTest said this makes the library " unsuitable for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hyper-Threading ( HT ) on the multiprocessor tests , which many believe slowed the PC down . But Joswiak pointed to documents that show that HT is good for computer servers , but less suited for computational-intensive tasks , which were the focus of the tests . These documents , from Dell , said that system performance tested using SPEC2000 benchmarks with HT enabled was " decreased 6 to 9 percent on the CPU2000 speed tests and decreased 27 to 37 percent on the CPU2000 throughput tests . " Adding more uncertainty to this mix is the kinds of compilers used . VeriTest tested a PC running Linux and the SPEC tests were compiled with GCC3.3 , a common UNIX compiler . The tests on the GS were compiled the same way , according to VeriTest 's report . Many in the Windows community complained that the PC would have scored higher if the SPEC benchmarks had been compiled with an Intel-optimized compiler instead of a generic UNIX one . Joswiak replied that was probably true , but that Apple would have scored higher if it had used an OS X-optimized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we attempted to run the same tests , serious problems developed . Everything ran fine on the HR and it scored well in the tests : 27.8 for the SPECintrate 2000 and 16.3 for the SPECfp rate 2000 , which handily beat Apple 's published benchmarks . However , we could never get the tests to run on the Apple machine . There were several reasons : * Mac OS X is a form of UNIX based on the FreeBSD kernel . The SPEC2000 benchmarks we had needed a special configuration file to make them work with the operating system . * Even though VeriTest published the configuration file it used for the tests , we could never make it work because it was designed for a previous version of Mac OS X ( 10.2 ) and we were running 10.3 . Also , VeriTest ran tests on " prototype " equipment from Apple . The published configuration file would not work on a retail Apple G5 box . * VeriTest declined to help work up a new configuration file for us . Chris Lemmons , a marketing representative for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the tests to run on OS X 10.2 . " Apple is an important client of ours , " Lemmons said . VeriTest also said the configuration file was Apple 's property and it could n't help us unless Apple said it was okay . This made little sense because the configuration file was published on the Web . * Apple declined to help with the SPEC benchmarks and the configuration file because , by this time , the company was no longer using those benchmarks . Instead , Apple started using testing methods such as video rendering . Adobe Photoshop tests , audio editing , and science and technical tests such as matching genome sequences and DNA sequences . These are core to Apple 's biggest customers . Why the change in tests ? Because , Apple said , at the time the G5 debuted , there were no benchmarks that were optimized for its new processor . Adobe Photoshop was the only commercial application at the time that took advantage of the 64-bit chip . Not being able to run SPEC tests , we turned to BLAST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as to Bibble , a batch image-processing application . The problem is that these tests do not run on Windows XP . In frustration , after running the SPEC tests on the HP xw6000 workstation , we installed Linux on the HR which allowed us to run the new tests . And we were surprised . The G5 was 59.5 percent faster than the HP at processing 85 high-resolution color photographs totaling 684.6MB of data . In the HMMer tests ( 61.3MB of data ) , Apple was 67 percent faster than the PC and under BLAST ( 32.8MB ) , Apple was 85.9 percent faster . These results are in line with those now published on Apple 's Web site . Meanwhile , the United Kingdom 's Independent Television Commission has banned Apple from claiming to be the fastest personal computer because " there was insufficient evidence to support the claim . " And since the controversy over the SPEC tests erupted , and Apple began using new tests , the computer maker no longer uses the " fastest computer " claim in its advertising . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the G5 chip ( www.apple.com/ powermac/performance ) , the word " fastest " does n't appear . Apple said it , it said , was to launch the G5 with performance claims and then focus on the software available that is optimized for the chip , such as Adobe Photoshop . What Matters ? Computing technology evolves at an astounding speed . AMD now has its Athlon 64-bit chip , which probably beats the G5 ( we did n't have one to test ) . But at press time there were rumors that Apple was set to introduce a 2.6-GHz G5 within weeks , likely leapfrogging the competition again . Who 's fastest ? We suppose it depends on when you ask and what tests you run . But in a way , the controversy over Apple 's use of SPEC benchmarks , the discarding of the " fastest computer " claim and the adoption of new tests may call into question the idea of benchmarks themselves rather than Apple . A computer is a system of components that work together . The CPU , RAM , data bus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together to produce today 's blazing speeds . Any one of those components can drag down the overall speed of a system . Simply measuring a single component tells very little about the system 's total performance . Maybe instead of asking which computer is the fastest , people should ask which is the most useful for what they want it to do . Sidebar Apple 's advertisement that sparked the original controversy .
