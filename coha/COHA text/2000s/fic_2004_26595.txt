Mary Bliss McGowan and Katharine Weidman had reached a point in the evening from whence there was no return . They had half a bottle of Tanqueray . They had limes . Plenty of ice . Plenty of time . It was only the Tuesday after Memorial Day , so the summer still stretched ahead of them , as green and tempting as a funeral home lawn . The hell of it was , they were out of tonic water . " Listen , Kate , " Mary Bliss said . " Why do n't we just switch to beer ? " She gestured toward her cooler . It had wheels and a long handle , and she hauled it down to the Fair Oaks Country Club pool most nights like the little red wagon she 'd dragged all over town as a little girl . " I 've got four Molson Lights right there . Anyway , all that quinine in the tonic water is making my ankles swell . " She thrust one suntanned leg in the air , pointing her pink-painted toes and frowning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Or maybe we should call it a night . " Mary Bliss glanced around . The crowd had been lively for a Tuesday night , but people had gradually drifted off - home , or to dinner , or inside , to their air conditioning and mindless summer sitcom reruns . Bugs swarmed around the lights in the deck area . She felt their wings brushing the skin of her bare arms , but theynever lit on Mary Bliss , and they never bit either . Somebody had managed to hook up the pool 's PA system to the oldies radio station . The Tams and the Four Tops , the same music she 'd listened to her whole life - even though they were not her oldies but of a generation before hers - played on . She and Katharine were the only adults around . Three or four teenaged boys splashed around in the pool , tossing an inflated beach ball back and forth . The lifeguard , the oldest Finley boy - Shane ? Blaine ? - sat on the elevated stand by the pool and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lock up and go to the mall . " No , " Katharine said , struggling out of her lounge chair . " No beer . Hell , it 's early yet . And you know I 'm not a beer drinker . " She tugged at Mary Bliss 's hand . " Come on , then . The Winn-Dixie 's still open . We 'll get some more tonic water . We 'll ride with the top down . " Mary Bliss sniggered and instantly hated the sound of it . " Well-bred young ladies never drive with their tops down . " Katharine rolled her eyes . The Weidmans ' red Jeep stood alone in the club lot , shining like a plump , ripe apple in the pool of yellow streetlamp light . Mary Bliss stood by the driver 's door with her hand out . " Let me drive , Kate . " " What ? You think I 'm drunk ? " " We killed half a bottle of gin , and I 've only had one drink , " Mary Bliss said gently . Katharine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunned the engine and backed out of the club parking lot . The cool night air felt wonderful on her sweat-soaked neck and shoulders . " I ca n't believe Charlie gave up the Jeep , " Mary Bliss said . " I thought it was his baby . Is it paid for ? " " What do I care ? " Katharine said , throwing her head back , running her fingers through the long blonde tangle of her hair . " My lawyer says we 've got Charlie by the nuts . Now it 's time to squeeze . Besides , we bought it with the understanding that it would be Chip 's to take to Clemson in the fall . I 'm just using it as my fun car this summer . We 're having fun , right ? " " I thought freshmen were n't allowed to have cars on campus , " Mary Bliss said . " Charlie does n't know that , " Katharine said . Mary Bliss frowned . " Shut up and drive , " Katharine instructed . The Winn-Dixie was nearly deserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the store , listlessly counting change into her open cash drawer . Katharine dumped four bottles of Schweppes Tonic Water down on the conveyor belt , along with a loaf of Sunbeam bread , a carton of cigarettes , and a plastic tub of Dixie Darlin ' chicken salad . " Y'all got a Value Club card ? " the cashier asked , fingers poised on the keys of her register . " I 've got better than that , " Katharine said peevishly , taking a twenty-dollar bill from the pocket of her shorts . " I 've got cash money . Now , can we get the lead out here ? " The fluorescent lights in the store gave Katharine 's deeply tanned face a sick greenish glow . Her roots needed touching up . And , Mary Bliss observed , it really was about time Katharine gave up wearing a bikini . Not that she was fat . Katharine Weidman was a rail . She ran four miles every morning , no matter what . But she was in her forties , after all , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to turn to corduroy . Her breasts were n't big , but they were beginning to sag . Mary Bliss tugged at the neckline of her own neat black tank suit . She could n't stand it the way some women over thirty-five paraded around half naked in public - as if the world wanted to see their goods . She kept her goods tucked neatly away , thank you very much . Mary Bliss made a face as she saw Katharine sweeping her groceries into a plastic sack . " Since when do you buy chicken salad at the Winn-Dixie ? " she asked , flicking the tub with her index finger . " It 's not that bad , " Katharine said . " Chip loves it , but then , teenaged boys will eat anything . Anyway , it 's too damn hot to cook . " " Your mother made the best chicken salad I 've ever tasted , " Mary Bliss said . " I still dream about it sometimes . It was just like they used to have at the Magnolia Room downtown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Mama always said the sign of a lady 's breeding was in her chicken salad . White meat , finely ground or hand shredded , and some good Hellmann 's Mayonnaise , and I do n't know what all . She used to talk about some woman , from up north , who married into one of the Coca-Cola families . ' She uses dark meat in her chicken salad , ' Mama told me one time . ' Trailer trash . ' " " She 'd roll over in her grave if she saw you feeding her grandson that store-bought mess , " Mary Bliss was saying . They were right beside the Jeep now , and Mary Bliss had the keys in her hand , when Katharine shoved her roughly to the pavement . " What on earth ? " Mary Bliss demanded . " Get down , " Katharine whispered . " She 'll see us . " " Who ? " Mary Bliss asked . She pushed Katharine 's hand off her shoulder . " Let me up . You 've got me squatting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Katharine said , peeping up over the side of the Jeep , then ducking back down again . " She 's sitting in that silver Lexus , over there by the yellow Toyota . My God ! " " What ? What is it ? " Mary Bliss popped her head up to get a look . The Lexus was where Katharine had pointed . But there was only one occupant . A man . A dark-haired man . His head was thrown back , his eyes squeezed shut , his mouth a wide O , as if he were laughing at something . " You 're crazy , Katharine Weidman . I do n't see Nancye Bowden at all . " She started to stand . " I 'm getting a crick in my calves . Let 's go home . " Katharine duck-walked around to the passenger side of the Jeep and snaked herself into the passenger seat . She slumped down in the seat so that her head was barely visible above the dashboard . " I 'm telling you she 's in there . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mary Bliss . With that guy . Look at his face , Mary Bliss . Do n't you get it ? " Mary Bliss did n't have her glasses . She squinted , tried to get the man 's face in better focus . Maybe he was n't laughing . " Oh . " My . " Lord . " Mary Bliss covered her eyes with both hands . She felt her face glowing hot-red in the dark . She fanned herself vigorously . " You 're such a virgin . " Katharine cackled . " What ? You did n't know ? " " That Nancye Bowden was hanging out in the Winn-Dixie parking lot giving oral sex to men in expensive cars ? No , I do n't think she mentioned it the last time I saw her at garden club . Does Randy know ? " Mary Bliss turned the key in the Jeep 's ignition and scooted it out of the parking lot , giving the silver Lexus a wide berth . She would die if Nancye Bowden saw her . " It 's called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows what Nancye 's been up to . But you ca n't bring yourself to say it , can you ? " Katharine said , watching Mary Bliss 's face intently . " You have a very trashy mouth , Katharine Weidman . How would I know what perversion Nancye has been up to lately ? " " I guess y'all were down at Seaside when it happened . I just assumed you knew . Nancye and Randy are through . She moved into an apartment in Buckhead . He 's staying in the house with the kids , at least until school starts back in the fall , and his mother is watching the kids while Randy 's at work . Lexus Boy is some professor over at Emory . Or that 's what Nancye told the girls at that baby shower they had for Ansley Murphey . " " I had to miss Ansley 's shower because we took Erin down to Macon for a soccer tournament , " Mary Bliss said . " I ca n't believe I did n't hear anything , with them living right across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My heavens , that 's the third couple on the block . Just since the weather got warm . " " Four , counting us , " Katharine said . " You know what they 're calling our end of the street , do n't you ? " " What ? " " Split City . " ( Continues ... )
