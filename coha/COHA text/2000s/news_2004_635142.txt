<p> The pace of the lives of Americans today is increasing at what seems to be an exponential rate . The Internet , mobile phones , mass media and other " advances " in technology have made it very easy to overlook the significance of a moment of relaxation or a social meeting with friends . <p> That is why the Illinois Licensed Beverage Association would like to remind the residents of the Chicago area to remember the importance of good times with good friends by observing May as National Tavern Month . <p> The Illinois Licensed Beverage Association supports the numerous tavern owners who consistently seek to offer a relaxing sanctuary in their communities through the responsible retailing of adult beverages . We also recognize the positive impact that taverns have on local economies and their historical place in American culture . <p> As common and reliable in most places as post offices , taverns have changed in design over the years but still maintain their congruity as local meeting places where business can be discussed or leisure enjoyed . Taverns have existed , in one form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of its settlement . The first taverns were intended for townspeople and travelers alike , and were often a marketplace for opinions , news of the day , comforting drink and social interaction . This still holds true . <p> Let 's all make sure to take a moment this month to raise a glass and toast the American tavern  --  the " friendliest place in town ! " <p> Steve Riedl , <p> executive director , <p> Illinois Licensed <p> Beverage Association <p> The real Wal-Mart threat <p> News coverage of the City Council 's decision whether to open the door to the city 's first two Wal-Mart stores has favored shopworn stereotypes  --  i.e. , union interests colliding with those of the community  --  and many supporters of Wal-Mart want to portray this situation as solely a union issue . This is not an issue of union vs. non-union . It 's an issue of quality economic development vs. de-development that saps and eventually destroys communities . <p> Wal-Mart 's record of bleeding more jobs than it creates is not development ; it 's de-development . Wal-Mart says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A report from UIC 's Center for Urban Economic Development concludes that more than 250 Chicago jobs will be lost as a result of Wal-Mart 's entry  --  315 , to be precise . Unlike the politicians and planners observing development from afar , the residents of the South and West sides where the stores would go will feel the effects of Wal-Mart 's business practices firsthand . <p> Wal-Mart 's abysmal anti-union record is only a small part of its history of destruction . What makes Wal-Mart especially dangerous is its ability to crush competition , act as a monopoly and swallow up the indigenous retail life of communities . As the world 's largest retailer , with more than 3,400 stores in the United States alone , Wal-Mart has no fear of price undercutting . Its reliance on overseas sweatshops , its poor treatment of employees and its relentless squeezing of suppliers allow it to crush anyone in its path . The boarded-up main streets , deserted central business districts and dwindling variety of consumer choice found in thousands of small- and medium-size towns across America bear Wal-Mart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that sounds like monopoly and destruction . <p> To place blind faith in development is naive . The city flexes its muscle to attract Boeing and the Ford supplier parts plant and thousands of upscale residents to up-and-coming neighborhoods . We certainly can use our muscle to bring merchants and communities together to create a retail sector that not only mimics the vibrant suburban retail market the mayor would have , but goes it one better by actually promoting economic development . <p> Michael Bennett , <p> executive director , <p> Egan Urban Center , <p> DePaul University <p> Bigger fish to fry <p> With the administration warning that another terrorist attack on our soil is likely before the November election , Americans might expect Congress to focus on shoring up the holes in our national security . Republican senators , however , have taken on a higher calling : " promoting the cultural importance of traditional marriage . " They have launched public hearings about what constitutes a healthy marriage . We should have a roll call to see who is qualified to lead this discussion , having no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marital history . <p> Republican senators insult the public 's intelligence when they say they 're not using these hearings as a springboard to enact a ban on same-sex marriage or to secure Bush 's re-election . Are we to believe they 're just excited to have found an " endangered species " they can preserve without negatively impacting the profits of their big business constituency ? <p> Americans should be outraged that marriage  --  traditional or same-sex  --  is taking center stage at a time when : Social Security and Medicare are headed for bankruptcy ; our troops just experienced the deadliest month since the Iraq war began , and with many of our allies withdrawing their troops and refusing to share the costs of the war . It 's time to tell our legislators to get out of our bedrooms and focus on the responsibilities outlined for them in the Constitution . <p> Sheryl Jedlinski , Palatine <p> Hillary has her hats straight <p> In casting aspersions on Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton for wearing a New York Yankees cap , Michael Sneed column , May 2 has clearly forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ namely , that a South Sider 's two favorite teams are the White Sox and whoever is playing the Cubs . <p> Similarly , a North Sder will root for the dear old Cubbies and whatever team is making life difficult for the Sox . Thus , it should come as no surprise that a lifelong Cub fan who has relocated to New York would develop an affinity for the Yankees , with whom the White Sox have had a century-old rivalry . <p> A perceptive observer would have noted that Sen. Clinton has carefully avoided attending New York Mets games and wearing a Mets cap . Sneed should have given Hillary credit for being both a loyal Cub fan and the adroit politician she clearly is . <p> Chet Alexander , Alsip <p> A moving WW II tribute <p> The World War II memorial in Washington , D.C. , recently opened to the public about a month early , before the official dedication scheduled for Memorial Day . I had an occasion to be in our nation 's capital when they took down the construction fence , allowing the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation of American fighting men and women . At this ethereal place it is set to stone that , " Here we mark the price of freedom . " <p> My father served in the U.S. Navy on Saipan , in the western Pacific . I wish that he could have been there with me on that bright , sunny day and stood next to the carved granite signifying Saipan 's place in the history of this war . He could have told me once again about the brave , courageous fellows he served with and how much they affected his life until his death last February . My dad is one of the 1,000 Americans who now die each day who fought in the global conflict where 400,000 lost their lives in combat . Only 4 million of the 16 million who served still are living . <p> If glory is fleeting , then we need not vex about obscuring our World War II veterans any longer . They finally have an appropriate tribute from a grateful nation with our enduring respect and proper honor . A visit to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are privileged to listen to these wise and vigilant citizens from a war gone by , and perhaps if we listen in more attentively , history would not have to repeat itself . <p> Jerry Wilkerson , Crete <p> U.S. gives too much <p> It was reported in the Wall Street Journal that the United States released a Muslim terrorist in order to appease the insurrection . Further , they installed an admitted military supporter of Saddam Hussein as a local warlord to allow the Marines to withdraw from the engagement . <p> Why is this action acceptable ? Will this be the way we buy our withdrawal from this conflict ? What happened to our policy of not negotiating with terrorists ? <p> Alan " Pete " Bingham , <p> Schaumburg <p> Stamp of approval <p> I think the old Post Office on Congress Parkway would be the best place for a casino , hotel and shopping center . <p> Dorothy Schrode , <p> Brighton Park <p> Easy access <p> If the City of Chicago decides to construct a casino at McCormick Place , at least we wo n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Dane Ronvik , West Ridge <p> MY TWO CENTS <p> " The deserted central business districts and dwindling variety of consumer choice found in thousands of small towns across America bear Wal-Mart 's fingerprints . That does not sound like economic development ; that sounds like monopoly and destruction . "  --  michael bennett
