HE SEES THROUGH THE BLUE and it goes away , he sees through the blue and it goes away again . He breathes , blowing just high . The blue moves but not too much , the blue moves and stays blue and moves . He can see into the sky where there are no shapes . The shapes that move around him are big , colliding and joining and going apart . They 're the warm feel of what he hears and smells next to him , of those who hold and move and touch and lift him , saying these curls get so tangled , wipe off his hands . Lark , there 's Termite . His aunt is Nonie and his sister is Lark , and he sings one sound or another to keep them away or draw them near . That 's all he 'll say , he wo n't tell and tell . <p> Lark bends over him and her hair falls along his neck and shoulders , her hair moves and breathes over his back and chest in a dark curtain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have dried , like the handful of rose petals he grasped until they were soft and damp . Lark names the flowers and he says the sounds but the sounds are not the flowers . The flower is the shape so close he sees it still enough to look , blue like that , long and tall , each flared tongue with its own dark eye . Then the shape moves and the flower is too close or too far . The shape becomes its colors but he feels Lark touch it to his face and lips like a weightless velvet scrap . The flower moves and blurs and smears , he looks away to stop it disappearing . Pictures that touch him move and change , they lift and turn , stutter their edges and blur one into another , moving in their noise and their changing air . The colors fall apart and are never still long enough for him to see , but the pictures inside him hold still . They hold very still in their silence and show themselves . Inside him the pictures come close , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , moving in gray shades that are soft and slow and let him see . The pictures inside him might whisper but their sounds are quiet and the words are always the same . He listens for the words . Inside him the pictures are clear and sharp and flat like the flat words of books Lark holds near his eyes . The pictures near the words are colors that run and shine , but the pictures inside him stay and never blur . They might say one color or two , bright colors that shine in the gray like jewels . He sees them for no reason , or when the sounds of the train or the pounding of rain flies inside him and all around him . He sees the pictures again and again , moving through their stories before they stop . Rarely there 's one he has n't seen before , a picture clear and quiet , revealed as though a curtain slowly lifts , a curtain moving as Lark 's hair might move , parting and falling away until the picture is still and complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures stay until they end , telling their stories that repeat and repeat again . He sees them without trying . It 's how Lark sees everything , everywhere they go . She could n't walk and run so fast and be so sure through his moving colors , his dark that blurs . But she ca n't hear what he hears . He listens hard to tell . She never knows what 's coming but he ca n't say and say . <p> Lark says feel your soft blue shirt want to wear this ? She says you 're nine years old now , hold the crayon it 's green as grass is green . She says listen to the radio even if it 's not so loud as you like . She says eat your toast while it 's hot and she gives him toast , thick and warm and buttery in his hand with the blue jam on the knife like the farmer 's wife . The knife comes and goes across the plates . The table holds the pouring and crashing and banging while Nonie walks hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white shoes . Her legs swish every step and he can feel her stepping room to room to room . No matter where she is he can hear , and he puts his head on the table to hear the sound alone through the wood without all the other sounds . But she picks him up , one strong arm around his chest and the other bent for the seat under him she calls his throne . They move fast , thudding across the floor out the door onto the ground where the sound goes hollow and deep . The porch door bangs . <p> Sudden morning air floats low to the ground amidst the small houses like fragrant evaporating mist , a cool bath of night dew and shadow and damp honeysuckle scent . He gasps and hears the sharp grass under them move its fibrous roots . Lark has brought his chair but he leans far back in Nonie 's arms to look and look into the dense white sky . Heat will climb down in wisps and drifts , losing itself in heavy pieces until it falls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river still . Far up the heat turns and moves like a big animal trying to rouse . All the while he can hear Elise 's car roll its big wheels closer and closer until it turns roaring into the alley but Nonie puts him in his chair . She brushes his hair back with her two broad hands while the car throbs in the narrow tracks of the alley , crushing gravel to rattles and slides and bleating loud . He calls and calls and he wants to go but Nonie goes . Under the motor sound he hears the car take her weight , a sigh before the door slams . The car roars away down the stones onto the smooth pavement and goes until it 's gone . There 's a shape in the air where the car was . He feels the shape hold still before it begins to end . Slowly the air comes back . The grass begins small sounds . <p> Termite , Lark says . I 'll fix the radio . Do n't worry . <p> Lark gives him the glass moon man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face there 's a trapped sweet smell no one can wash and its picture opens inside him . A red mouth poised to kiss blows air up and down his throat , across his eyes and forehead , moving in sounds he ca n't hear until he sees the teeth , even and white , flecked with red as waxen and red as crayon . The mouth goes still , curved as a bow , and pulls away . The eyes open close to him , so close , minutely faceted , dark rimmed and fractured , brilliantly wet and deep . The eyes blink , blink , slowly , so slowly , edged in sharp dark fur . They open , exact and reflective as glass , welling with their own water , deep as pools . Her hands on his hands are big and cool . He holds on but she pulls his hand gently open and gives him something hard and rounded and small and smooth that fits into his palm . He holds the moon face in his hand before he knows it 's a face or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay another instant before they close and fade . Lark 's fingers are long and smooth . They come and go . <p> Here 's your ribbon , Lark says . <p> She wraps the blue around his wrist . He moves it to his face , just above his eyes where the eyes have looked , but he does n't look . <p> Mow the grass , Lark says . Big storm they talk about . <p> He waits . Soon she 'll go . <p> She says , Do n't think you 're going to sit out here in the rain with lightning flashing all around you . <p> He holds still , listening . Far down the alley where the gravel meets the street , he hears the orange cat paw forward on its ragged paws . Away down the alley across from Tuccis ' house the ragged orange cat is stepping careful , dragging its belly along the stones under the lilacs . The cat waits then for Lark to go . The cat waits low and long where no one sees and the growl in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stick or a handful of gravel that lands like stinging rain . <p> Termite , Lark says . <p> She puts her face close to his , her eyes against his eyes . Lark 's brown eyes are stirred like the river when the river is milky with rain . She knows he can see if she 's very close but he does n't look now , he does n't try , he does n't want her to stay . <p> She says , You ring the bell if you want anything . <p> He wants to hear the train . Far off the train 's bell sound is long and wide and dark as the shade under the railroad bridge . The bridge goes over the river and the trains pour overtop . He wants to feel the roar . Lark and the Tuccis take him through the rail yard on the way to the river , between the Polish hoys and the ditch . The boys have got a snarling something in the ditch with their sticks and Lark says they 're worse than the dogs when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dog sounds like a cat and a farmer 's wife with a carving knife . Joey and Solly fight the boys and Zeke stays in the wagon . Lark is never scared . Joey and Solly roll over in the dirt punching and grunting with the Polish boys from Lumber Street and Zeke throws stones behind . <p> Zeke , hold Termite tight . Here 's a faster ride . <p> And they 're riding faster and faster into the cool where the arched tunnel walls are furry and the leaves move all up and down the rock until the ivy is shadows on the curve above . No sky it 's a stone sky Termite , that 's why it 's gray . The river is full and slipping slow . Beside them the river is the only sound until Joey and Solly burst out yelling from the bushes . <p> So you 've got a bloody lip , no call to yell like a banshee . Look Termite , a scraped bruise like a star on his chest . Solly , wash off in the water and cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'll know you 've been fighting . <p> Termite , Joey says if they ever bother you in the wagon again he 'll beat them so bad they 'll need more than wagons to drag their asses through the rain . You cold Termite ? Look , we 'll make a fire . We 'll build a stone circle on the bare dirt where no weeds can catch . And Zeke , if you tell Nonie we took the matches we wo n't bring you next time . No more telling about fires or fights and you can have marshmallows . We only need some sticks for Joey to sharpen , he loves his knife so much . <p> Termite , look how the fire leaps up , see how warm ? <p> Does n't matter if it rains , the river is full of rain . We could ride the river all the way through Winfield past Parkersburg to Sophia and Shady Spring , past Pulaski and Mount Airy . We could ride the train to Charleston straight through to Charlotte and Jacksonville , clear to Florida , Termite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , like that water sound inside them , all spread out for miles , bigger than a country , bigger than the air you watch through your ribbons . Nonie cuts ribbons from the blue plastic bags that cover her uniforms three at a time . Sometimes her uniforms hang in Elise 's car in the sun and the blue is warm . Nonie works at Charlie 's and she does n't go to the river . She says the rail yard is practically deserted now and no place for them to be . But there are no boys anymore at the rail yard , no sounds in the ditch , only empty trains passing south and sometimes a man in a boxcar dropping bottles out . Not at you Termite , tramps ride the trains and sometimes they clean house . Lark takes him close the empty boxcars on the overgrown sidings and lets him touch the hard broad sides of the cars from the wagon . Blocks of silence shift behind the enormous doors , trapped inside , too big to turn or rest . The sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banked heat even in the morning . Termite feels their low steel drone in his fingertips , a drunken stir like hundreds of stunned insects warmed and beginning to move . But the cars do n't move ; they 're hot and cold and day and night and he stays still to hear them . Lark does n't hear , she does n't know . Metal cars carry things , she says . Things do n't live or die so it does n't matter if the metal cars heat up or glaze with frozen rain . Lark says there used to be open coal cars , long flatbed cars filled from coal carts at the tipple no one uses anymore , but the mines have closed . The wooden boxcars breathe , she says ; they transported animals and canned goods and boxes of food . They have skinny windows too high for cattle to see out of and the loud wind of the train cooled chickens caged so small they could n't move and so they went to sleep . That was a long time ago . The rail yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boxcars only wait or move empty to bigger towns . Scheduled freights pour through the yard without stopping and Lark moves him far back to watch , farther still if cinders hit the wagon like hard black sparks . The rushing trains are a deep blurred blue too fast to see and their clacking passage is a long explosion . Once a bottle thrown from a train smashed at his feet , brief as bells in the roar . A mean drunk , Lark said , not like most of them , old men riding and drinking . They do n't bother us , Lark says . It 's the trains that are fierce , rumbling their rattling music to shake the ground , crossing the river and leaving the town , leaving and leaving . At night the long low whistles sound far off like windy cries , moist with dew and darkness . Nonie does n't know , she does n't hear . She comes home and takes off her shoes and says she 'd give anything . <p> Lark says , Termite . <p> Lark says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drags its belly across where the grass is short and the stones are sharp , under the lilacs that have no flowers . The flower smell is gone and the white falls off the trees . seeds , Lark says , little seeds with parachutes to fly them Termite , all in your hair , and she runs her fingers through his hair , saying how long and how pretty . He wants the grass long and strong , sounding whispers when it moves , but the mower cuts it . The mower cuts and cuts like a yowling knife . He hears the mower cutting and smells the grass pouring out all over the ground , the green stain so sharp and wet it spills and spills . The mower cuts everything away and Nick Tucci follows the mower , cutting and cutting while the orange cat growls low to move its soft parts across the chipped sharp stones . Deep under the lilacs where no one sees , the orange cat waits for the roar to stop . Cats hide in the weeds by the river , scared of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ditch . Under the rail bridge the dirt is dark and soft where the river stops . Termite 's feet reach almost to the end of the wagon and Lark puts books there with the Thermos and cups and towels and she wears her bathing suit under her dress . She always tells him what she 's wearing , what he 's wearing , she says she likes him to know . Solly pulls the wagon and then he 's still and listens to the river while Lark reads Termite his book about giants and billy goats . She pours iced tea into Termite 's cup with the straw and says that cat has a ragged Hp , old ragged cat that follows us everywhere . Solly , do n't let that cat in here . And Solly takes off his shirt to make a snapping tail that cuts loud and sharp across the stones , cutting the shirt sharp as a rope against the walls in the echo . Fe fi fo fum , I smell the blood . Solly 's shape comes and goes , walking up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's enough , the cat 's run off . Then it 's quiet . Just the heat like a mild buzz over the water . Solly says after the train comes they 're going in the river , hot as Hades and the river 's warm enough for a bath . <p> No one can see us in the tunnel . Termite sure wo n't tell . I made a bed of weeds , see how soft . <p> We have to go to Charlie 's for lunch . <p> So go later . I brought lunch . We can make afire and heat the cans in the coals . She does n't know when you come and go or who you re with . <p> She knows . <p> She does n't know . I do n't come around anymore when she 's there . Anyway what have we done . <p> The river turns and turns . Coming closer the train begins to whisper in the stones . He begins to say and say . <p> Lark , give him your sandals now , before the train comes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You want to . You want to every day , as much as me . <p> He hears them . Breathing is a bath between them , deeper and deeper , deep as the river and moving . <p> Wear your clothes then . I know what you look like , just not all at once . I 'll be still , so still Here 's the train , do it now . Give him your shoes . <p> Lark 's sandals are warm and soft , the leather shaped to her feet worn slick as silk and the straps thick enough to hold tight . The ground is moving and the stone of the tunnel hums itself full before the train is on them . The roar is louder and louder until the river in front of him goes dark . The brushy island that stands up in the middle of the water disappears like a sunken lump . He ca n't see the blurred shape anymore or hear the sticks that swak and drag by the river 's muddy edge . The train goes bright inside him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he opens his mouth to breathe . The tunnel is empty and full at once , so empty he spins down and down in the wagon , the wagon turns pliable and quick as a powerful limb and he rides it deeper and deeper . The picture he sees inside the roar is the tunnel inside the tunnel . He 's been here before and he looks deeper each time and sees . There are sleepers everywhere , bodies crowded together . The bodies are always here , so many of them in the tunnel when the train roars across above , bodies spilled and still , barely stirring . The train is what pulls and lifts them and shows them and lets them move . They know he sees them but they can not say or see . No sounds , just the roar and the shaking of the train , lifting them just enough with their eyes still dosed , turning them over like the pages of a book . One shape stands and turns toward him , a man 's shape opening his glowing hands as though to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright . Light burns like a white fire and then the pounding starts , pounding and pounding until the train pours off , gone away where none of them can reach . <p> Termite ? Trains gone . Lark says you hear me . You hear me ? <p> Breathe now Termite , breathe . <p> Termite , trains gone for today . Let go of the shoes and we 'll go swimming . She 's wearing her suit but boys do n't have to , boy s go naked . I 've got you just fine now , see ? I know you want the train back but it 's gone . <p> We 're in the water Termite . I 'm just standing but you 're swimming . See ? You 're so light I can turn you like a fish . Lark , he 's smiling . You like it . Any boy likes the river . Do n't tell Nonie or my dad I took you in the river though . Our secret . The flowers are secrets , each one like a taut soft insect whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild in the field between the river and Polish town , reaching high through the rooty grasses that sway and cut . In Nonie 's backyard garden the sunflowers stand up behind rosebushes and delphinium and low clumping violets . They lie on the ground so Lark can touch his hand to cool dirt under the widest leaves . Nasturtium leaves she says , and the flowers will be orange . You can eat them like salad , only if I give them to you Termite . She puts his palm to rodlike sunflower stalks , and the quiet thrum and surge in their fine-haired stems is like the soundless hum he hears in the wall at night when the lights go on . Nonie snaps on the lamp and tells Lark she 'll need her eyes a long time , no need to go blind like some people , and Lark tells her no one here 's blind . She touches her face to his eyes and opens his hands to take away the colors , petals she gave him that morning to show each separate color . Lark says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes that twist shut in the dark . Blue like your eyes Termite , but not so full of light . Lark says each rose is a knot that comes apart , pink petals and red , and these yellow ones are farewells , and the white petals are everlastings that bloom all summer . The colors pulled from the flowers smell of one thing torn from another , they 're pieces and scraps that ache . He holds them in his hands and holds them until they 're damp and dark . At school the teacher tells him to hold still unless she says . She holds his hands tight shut and says to nod his head one time , two times , three times . Can he keep time to the music ? She knows he likes music . The farmer in the dell . She puts the straps around him in the chair with wheels , across his front and his chest . <p> There . You 're nice and safe and sitting as straight as you can . <p> The Victrola scratches out the song and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . <p> She starts it again . It 's Lark 's song not her song , and he moves his wrists to sound the bell on his chair but there 's no bell and this is not his chair or his house . No one can hear what he wants and he only knows the bus will come a long time after lunch to take him home . He likes the bus and its big noise even if he has to wait while kids call and yell and everyone lines up and he 's the only one the driver carries up the steps . The driver puts him in the chair just behind the driver 's seat and belts him in , and he can lean his head on the window . Footsteps pound heavy and light while the other kids climb on , most of them heavy and slow , a few light and skittering like bright leaves while the din of their voices goes high and low . The driver starts the engine and says Quiet , Quiet now , standing and waiting while the special bus gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start then , the growl and thrum every time the driver changes gears . The whole floor trembles like an animal rumbling under its skin and the sound is warm and deep inside him , pouring into him through the vibrating metal frame of his seat and the silver rim of the window . At railroad crossings the big bus halts and shudders and sighs , the doors swing open on their giant hinges with a whoosh and flap like metal wings exhaling . He sits very still to feel it all at once , breathing when the bus breathes . The bus is heavy and hard and vast and dark like the tunnel under the railroad bridge , but the bus is from the school . The bus goes to the school and comes from the school where the teacher holds on to his hands . <p> Did you listen close that time ? Now we 're going to clap . <p> She reaches for him and he pulls away . The lights on the ceiling are tubes and they flicker when he blinks . He can see the shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes his hands hard and when he pulls away she puts her hands on his head and pulls his face to hers . She smells hard and clean and chemical like the chair he sits in , and behind the hard smell is another smell , small and curled and crumbling in her mouth where her words come out . <p> I 'm here in front of you , see ? Look at me . People ? I need an aide over here . You , yes , please assist . Just stand behind him and keep his head stationary . Both hands . Gentle but firm . <p> The music goes again and the hands beside his eyes are fat and damp , his head held fast against the pillow of a white chest . The teacher 's aide is soft and big and he cant move . His breath gets fast and hard and he reaches away , reaching harder , trying to go , his fingers going fast . The teacher takes hold of his arms hard , she jerks them once twice three times and smashes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurches away but she grasps him hard , counting . His fingers race and his heart pounds and he hears the dull alarmed thud of a heartbeat in the back of his head . A sound keens out of him , a sound to push her back but she holds on and he goes into the sound , through it and beyond them until there are cold cloths on his head and his stinging wrists and his chair is pushed to the window . The needle of the Victrola bumps and bumps in air . <p> Stronger than he looks . Leave him be . Let him sit quiet if he will . Let him sit . <p> The smashed air swirls all around him , and when they 've gone the straps of the chair let him lean forward just enough to touch the window with his forehead . Colors and shapes surface through the pocked glass . The yellow form of the bus sits like a loaf-shaped blob on pulsing blacktop that tilts toward him in a sidelong square . The hot surface of the tar seethes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hears through a pin . He breathes Lark 's name inside himself where only she can hear and the hard black sea lies down . Now he stays still and waits for the bus to move . Lark puts one bowl and another bowl in his arms tight against him so the bowls do n't move , and down the alley the ragged orange cat is crawling flat and low under Tuccis ' house . The cat drags its flattened legs under the porch steps and squeezes through webs and rotting leaves , over hard black beetles hiding from the light and the small scattered bones of harvested creatures . Mice bones and bird bones , bones of voles and flat-nosed inch moles and rabbits too small to hop . The cat lies still on the cool dirt , safe in its litter of bones and scrap and day-long dusk that smells of humid mold . Lark smells like the soap smell on her hands . She stands behind him so the bowl stays tight and she holds the glass bottle of color in his hand . Two drops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him how the batter folds pastel pale . He can feel the heat outside , wavering in pale lines over the grass and the alley , glinting on stones and gravel and pressing hard to cut . Too hot to be out , Lark says . Plants droop closer the earth and the grass sighs like something squeezed , but the clean almond air of the soup in the bowl lifts in the weighted heat . Lark pushes his chair away because the racks slide out too hot , but the fan blurring side to side blows the sweet smell in circles even after the oven swallows the pans . He sits by the window and hears the faint roots of the grass in the alley , long veiny threads that hold still so hard they hum , reaching deep to drink where no one sees . He holds the radio to say and say with sounds . <p> The doorbell is like an alarm no one ever rings . He knows it 's going to ring and it rings loud . It catches like a chime that chokes and starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , Lark says . <p> The orange cat lifts its ragged head . The scars on its face shine yellow in the dark under Tuccis ' porch . <p> Lark pushes his chair to the living room . The couch where Nonie lies at night and rests her feet is empty . The piano is empty . The chairs are empty and the low table where Elise and Solly played cards is empty . The house is only for Lark and him and the sweet smell of the cake , but the doorbell rings again . There 's a glow through the window in the door . When he looks from the side he can feel it on his face , faintly cool . The heat from the open oven was like a shelf falling out and slamming , but the glow behind the door is quiet . Lark does n't always know but now she knows . She opens the door but she keeps it nearly shut and talks through the space between . Murmurs and sounds . A man talking , but not a heavy man like Nick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lark says . <p> The man steps closer , air that moves in a shape . The glow falls through the door onto Termite 's face and shoulders , a cool pale beam that 's found him . <p> Social Services , the man says , I was hoping I could speak . Voices are swirling all around his voice and the voices move when he moves . He 's more than himself . Lark does n't hear , she does n't know . Termite sees him , a shape glowing through the door Lark keeps nearly closed . He 's shining like a light . <p> This is your brother in home care do n't you find it . <p> His words come and go , words that echo with one whispered voice layered over another and another . The voices see inside , into every corner , into the basement and the boxes and the attic with its pull-down stairs , into Lark 's room and his room , into the wall Nick Tucci broke to make a bigger door between . <p> What 's his real name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . The voices touch each plant in Nonie 's garden behind the house , and the shed with the stacking chairs Lark puts here and here . They move up and down the alley , over the dry grass and hot white stones , around this house and that , careful and fast like a wind that rushes and knows . <p> Someone 's birthday if you need anything . <p> Lark shuts the door . They stay still , waiting for the man to leave . His footsteps sound going away and the voices rush after him , whispering small sounds . The glow and the cool air move away , trailing him like shadows no one sees . Then he 's outside the house , standing on the sidewalk . There 's a shadow of a taste in the warm room and the humid air darkens with a sweet tinge . Then the man turns and goes . Termite hears him leaving and leaving and the voices leave . SoHy says these are wild mint leaves , they grow by the tunnel wall where the sun can reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet in his hands . Says here , taste them Termite , on your tongue . They taste of salt and sweet and bitter green . Solly whispers , that 's her you taste on my fingers , even through the clothes she wont take off . Louder he says , the trains gone now . I know you want it back but now it 's gone . Hold on to me , I 'll take you in the water . You love the water . <p> The water comes up high . Solly breathes , swimming them fast . The sky wavers . The water smells of iron because the train bled into its own shadow and poured its iron smell on the water , bled all through the water and cast its dark away . Lark sings the song sometimes about the bread upon the waters . Solly whispers , moving them in the bright shallows where Lark cant see . What can I do about her , he whispers , keeps whispering , what can I do . But the water does n't answer , the water is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is warm and heavy and dark as the space under his house where the ragged orange cat waits for nightfall . At night the orange cat hunts and the lilacs stir and Nonie rolls her stockings down before she puts her feet up on the couch . Now the orange cat peers through the broken lattice that covers the side of Tuccis ' porch and Lark puts the chairs just so around the plastic table . The alley bleeds its green smell where the mower cut . The alley waits for the dark to lie down across it and the ragged orange cat waits to crawl long and low where the alley is open and wet . Nick Tucci drinks his iced tea . He says he 's too thirsty to live , and the sounds in his throat drain down and down into the warm wet dark inside him . Termite says and moves until Nonie sends Lark into the house . Nick Tucci lets his big hands lie flat on the table , but the darkness inside him follows Lark , steps close behind her everywhere she steps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried in the wagon and put his wet face on Termite 's face . <p> One of your boys maybe . <p> Open the door for her to jump in . <p> He rings his bell once and Lark answers . She has the glass moon man in her hand and the cold across her face when she bends to get the cake . <p> Nick Tucci gets up and moves toward her , dark as the stones in the tunnel . He steps hard across the ground , moving dark and heavy like a wall of cloud , deep as the water in the river and rolling . If he could press against Lark he would cry and hold on tight . Do n't you make him cry more now . Joey , you 're always teasing Zeke . I told you , Termite does n't cry because he does n't . When he was a baby we could never tell something was wrong except by how he moved . Zeke , you do n't have to cry . A dead thing is scary but now I covered it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , she left her kittens before they even opened their eyes . Solly , you can take these kittens home for Zeke . Take your shirt off Solly , and we 'll wrap them up and keep them warm . There , the little things . Hear them crying ? All little ones cry , do n't they Termite . Except you never needed to cry . The cake in his mouth is three tastes he can taste . Lark says the names of the tastes are like the colors , one drop and two drops , and when she ices the cakes she moves the knife fast , turning the plates round and round so the cakes turn too like soft sweet wheels . Then she puts one wheel on top of another and ices the cake all around , turning it careful like a special prize . They sit by the alley that pools its sharp green smell and glints its quiet stones while cars move on the street . Cars plow through the heat with their tires ticking , sticky on the hot roads . Everyone waits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air pressing down lets go slow . Evenings by the alley every grass yard makes a different sound , higher and lower , up and down . There are sounds in every house . Nonie sits between Nick Tucci and Lark , and Nick says about the river being brown and green and they 're laughing and he does n't know but he says and says . <p> Oh that blue river . <p> He looks up to say , their laughter like chiming bells all around while the sky goes up and up . High up the rain is holding still before it falls . It 's going to fall and fall , roaring like the ocean sound in Lark 's seashells that she holds for him to hear . Oceans have waves , Lark says , waves pound like a pulse , and she puts his fingers on her wrist to feel a tiny surge beat and beat . The sound in her skin is like a word she says to keep time , but the sound in the shells only circles , coming and going in one curled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every birthday . They do n't have to have candles every time but Nonie has the candles and they 're small and white . Nick Tucci says he 'll hold the cake , and Lark and Nonie stand so near they touch Termite 's face with their faces . The cake comes close . The cake holds still and he sees . The lights are jumping and the black thread on fire inside each flame is burning smaller and bigger , standing and falling , and then the lights go out . He can make every sound and he makes small sounds . Lark , come and help me . Look how he likes the river . Stand here with the water to your chest and I 'll put him on my hack to swim around you . Hold to my neck Termite , and Lark will help you . Keep your hands on his back like that , stand still and I 'll turn you both . see , we 're like a clock 's hands , turning . see how good the water feels ? We 're swimming Termite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lark 's shape is taller and thinner than Nonie 's shape . Lark leans over him and stands by the sink in the kitchen . Nonie is soaping the dishes and Lark 's running the water for his bath . The soapy smell from the dishes and the smell of the bubble bath she pours in the tub are two smells like different flowers , both of them wet and hot . Lark turns and turns the water in the bath with one long arm and then she lets it pour . The dishes slide and clank . <p> Lark , are you in a dream ? It 's way too deep . <p> They ca n't make us send him to school , can they ? <p> Do n't have the training . Take care of him all this time . <p> Lark stops the water in his bath to let it cool and he can smell the soap . She says it really is going to rain hard and the wind is in the morning glory vines . Wind lifts the layers of the vines and sways them like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathtub and pours from the kitchen spigot into the sink and the night smell settles warm against the house , close against it like one animal against another . The vine has gone blind and closed its flowers but he hears it stirred and lifted in the dark , pushed against the window screen and sucked and pushed . He can hear the windy sound inside the louder sounds of water rushing and running . Nonie stands in the kitchen rinsing the dishes and the long neck of the spigot turns and gleams , light glancing off to say , but Nonie rubs the dishes with the fat sponge and he holds the radio while it says and says . The hard round knob against his wrist talks to the tubes inside , the tubes and wires Lark held close for him to see with the back of the radio gone . Then he had to say until she put it back together and let him hold it still , resting with its numbers lit and no sound coming out . He plays the radio to let it talk and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a whoosh and roar he tunes high and low , tuning the air between the lights . He holds the plastic box and turns and turns the knobs and the box plays air and sounds going loud and soft . The radio holds still and the vibrations play and play . Quite the technician . He thinks that buzz and noise is music . Lark , will you take that thing away from him . Well it 's his music , Lark says . <p> She takes the radio and turns the chimes fast on their string so they unwind slow and then slower and make their lights . Drain out some of that water , Nonie says . Lark makes his bath . Nonie tells her when to turn the taps , how much hot and cold , how high , but Lark pours the bubbles and the white froth smells of soap . Nonie crouches by the hard lip of the tub and the small groan of her legs sounds when she moves . He 's small and Lark is in the bath and Nonie puts him soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside his legs when Nome 's big hands come with the cloth . Lark holds him in the water and calls it swimming . She moves his arms like this and this and Nonie says hold still , you keep him still Lark , he does n't know not to breathe if the water 's over his face . The water is warm and still when Lark holds him just so and the bubbles leave a sweet skim when they go . Lark 's legs are long thin shapes floating in the white . He turns his head and bends close to smell the water . Lark says she 's writing his name where the bubbles were , she says her legs are his legs and they 're taller than the giant in his book they read at the river . The giant lives in the sky above the bean stalk and sings sounds to the Englishman , but Lark holds the bottle of bubbles close his face and says that was a bad giant . <p> We 're not smelling blood like him . We smell an evening in Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris has the Eiffel Tower , like that picture on the bottle . <p> But why do they have a tower ? You said Paris collaborated . <p> Not all of Paris , Lark . I told you , the Resistance were heroes and they fought all during the war . <p> Fighting when I was born , Nonie . <p> That 's right . You were the best thing that happened in 1942 . But when you came to Winfield in ' 45 things were good again and the fighting was over . You rinse him off now and I 'll get the towels . <p> Lark 's hands squeeze the doth and water falls in a clatter . <p> Fighting like Solly and Joey , Lark says soft when Nome 's gone . Tough messy fighters yelling a curse to scare the Polish boys . <p> Termite does n't ever tell or say but Zeke tells and Nick Tucci says if someone really gets hurt , Polish or not , he 'll belt the boy who threw the punch . Do n't tell Nonie , Lark says . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and now they do n't have to , the Polish kids take off when they see Joey and Solly . Termite loves the river , do n't you Termite ? The river flows east to west but the train runs north to south , crossing the double rail bridge overtop the stones . Termite , the tunnel is stone , cool as a cave . Nonie comes back in the white slip she wears under her uniform at Charlie 's , a broad shape in her white straps , the turn of her head the same and her strong shoulders soft and hard where he leans his head . Lark stands up in her bathing suit , holding him across his chest and the big towel comes close . He 's in Nome 's arms that are white and wide and clean and smell of the cucumbers she slices thin and puts across her eyes and throat . The other towels are on the floor and he lies on the soft towels , one on top of another like a hard bed . She dries his hair , rubbing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says and says . <p> Lark , you 're eleven years old and mother to that whole crew . Do n't you get tired of all those boys ? Do n't you ever want a frilly dress and a tea party ? <p> Lark wo n't say or tell . <p> All right , what a face . You cloud up like a thunderstorm . I guess it 's better you 're like you are , fast enough to keep up with them and fight them off if you have to . <p> Lark says she can fight anybody and Nonie lifts the towel away . Her fingers touch across his eyes and he lies still in moving air . Beyond the open bathroom window the morning glory vines are full of leaves and open trumpets . The vine turns and twines each instant , reaching with its hundred arms , breathing its own pale smell . <p> You may not be fighting them yet Lark , but you will if you have any sense . You 'd best remember boys ' hands wander . <p> The air is soft all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nonie says . <p> She holds his wrists gently and pulls him up so his hips rest on the floor . He swings gently and the air slips under his back in a crescent . This is good for him , makes his muscles stronger . Do it careful , like this . He 'll hold his head up to listen if you sing out something he wants to hear . <p> Lark sings the rhyme about the monkey and weasel chasing but it 's the vine he wants to hear , the sound of the leaves alive like ears uncurled and furled , the tiniest buds like soft pricked points and the flowers opened wide . In the mornings Lark picks one and holds it to his cheek , open like a mouth . Look , a glory , this is the color of your eyes . He knows they close tight at night , twisted like wrapped seeds . Lark picks the wrinkled blossoms for him to hold after dark ifNonie say s give him something . Then he 's still . Inside the glories he can hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grown across and back across the side of the house and the bathroom window , looped and twined so thick the window needs no curtain . At night the flowers droop and knock , soft closed thuds against the window screen . The leaves are sighing then , the leaves will not stop sighing . After his bath they let him sit alone because Nonie is sleeping . Lark fills the bathroom sink and leaves the door open a space . She takes her bath standing up but she does n't know , she does n't see unless she looks at him . She washes with the wet cloth and the water and her arms move the wet soap smell that 's in his hair and powdered on his neck . The high ratchety sound the crickets make is louder and softer and louder . Lark says they 're under the house and in the grass , and they know to sing when the dew wakes them . <p> Nonie does n't wake up and Lark 's eyes are closed . He can feel her close her eyes . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet squeezed cloth . Lark closes her eyes not to see but the ragged orange cat peers through the dark . He sounds low to say for the ragged orange cat and the cat starts its sounds , rumbling the solid steady hum it makes when it sits near him , watching and never touching . It even stands , balanced on its back feet , padding softly foot to foot , smelling him before it drops and crouches and rumbles more loud low noise . The orange cat purrs like an engine and never scatters stones like the cars in the alley , cutting through fast , smoking and throwing dust and tearing up the ground . Now the orange cat stops its sounds and moves , silent in the empty alley , up and down , into the yards and flower beds where moles tunnel and field mice burrow . The ragged orange cat creeps slowly , listening low to the ground before it runs in its crouching hop , and when it pounces there 's never a screech like the owls make in the trees . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big moth against a window screen , or the urged skitter of a mouse in a tiny box , trying and trying . The orange cat holds the flying soft as rags , moaning in its throat , and runs for the hole under Tuccis ' porch . It crawls in deeper , squeezing small . There 's a gasp and a tearing , all by touch and feel , and then a silence . When Solly 's car squeals into the alley , shrieking and roaring and lurching hard to stop , the ragged orange cat only pulls its torn prey harder , closer , deeper into its low scraped hole . The doors of the car open wide but Termite does n't hear them shut . The car stays waiting and the orange cat breathes . <p> Lark stands still by the kitchen window . She 's a pale shape glowing and turning , curving smooth as the watery face of the moon man she lets him hold and says hangs in the sky at night . She 's told him a moon is like a planet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mountains look like a face from far away . She stays near him . She knows he wants her to stay , and the bruised night inside the house is the same as the bruise in the alley . He looks and looks toward the open window and the frame of the window holds still . He ca n't see the moon but he feels its wash of lighter air falling over them , safe in the bald black of the dark . <p>
