How a Finnish wingsuiter is setting odd new benchmarks in human flight . // " In this kind of weather , if you land in the water , you 're going to die , " Visa Parviainen said to the hot air balloon 's pilot . Parviainen was clinging to the balloon 's basket last autumn , flying high above the small lakes near Lahti , Finland , on his way toward 7000 ft . His plan upon reaching that height was to detach himself from the balloon and fly over the landscape , as parallel to it as possible . In preparation for this event he had outfitted himself in a black helmet with small , sweptback wings-or possibly earsgiving him the appearance of a not-too-distant cousin of Mighty Mouse . The resemblance was enhanced by the larger wings attached to his suit-a red BirdMan S3 wingsuit , to be exact . On his feet he wore boots with a patch that read " Danger . " The footwear was aptly labeled . Wingsuits are by now a common sight to sky divers at drop zones all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Attached to them were two small jet engines he hoped would propel him through the sky . Parviainen climbed down onto a platform hanging on the outside of the basket and waited until the balloon reached the right altitude . Then he switched on the jets , scooted off and fell away . For centuries before ungainly " aeroplanes " arrived on the scene , people tried to fly wearing wings more like those used by Icarus-with similarly dire results . Take , for instance , Eilmer of Malmesbury , " The Flying Monk " of the 11th century , who leapt from a monastery tower and reportedly flew for 240-odd yards before falling to the earth and breaking both legs . Or mathematician Giovanni Battista Danti of Perugia , who in the 15th century strapped on a pair of wood and feather wings , and flew over the town square before crashing into the roof of St. Mary 's church and breaking a leg . Or the Grenoble surgeon Charles Bernouin , a more direct precursor of Parviainen 's , perhaps , who in January 1672 , wearing wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till he fell and broke his neck . The invention of the airplane did n't end the quest for personal , birdlike flight . While Wright brothers forerunners such as Otto Lilienthal jumped from hilltops , a new breed of canvas-clad batmen soon began using the newfangled flying machines as launching pads . At best , the pioneers glided for a few seconds before deploying parachutes ; at worst , they ended up dead . Batmen had their heyday in the ' ' 30s and ' ' 40s , but every decade since has had its practitioners . The art remained a largely lethal and futile endeavor until the mid-1990s , when a French sky diver named Patrick de Gayardon invented the ram-air wingsuit . Older wings typically consisted of a simple layer of cloth attached to poles along the arms . Like a modern parachute , Gayardon 's equipment had two layers of fabric that formed long cells . These inflated during flight to create true airfoils . Gayardon , too , died in a crash : After more than 500 winged jumps , he accidentally sewed his parachute into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a company called BirdMan Inc. was selling wingsuits all over the world . No matter how much they flit about the clouds , though , the birdmen only fly downward . The best of them achieve a glide ratio ( forward movement to descent ) of 2.5:1 . Until birdmen evolve hollow bones and much longer arms , they wo n't rise without engines . That 's where model airplane jets come in . Over the past decade , companies such as Advanced Micro Turbines have made ever smaller , lighter and more powerful engines . Parviainen is n't the only wingsuiter to think of using the jets to increase his forward velocity and generate lift . But he was the first to brave the jets ' flames and give it a try . The engines could n't be tested from a plane because they have trouble igniting in high winds . So Parviainen spent hours firing them while perched on a platform outside a balloon basket . For fuel tanks he had two hot-water bottles filled with kerosene stuffed inside his wingsuit . The bags collapse as the fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas . During the flight , Parviainen planned to hold a dead man 's switch : As soon as he let go to open his parachute the jets would cut off , preventing him from setting the canopy on fire . " With this flight we had three goals , " Parviainen told me . First , to see if he could get the equipment to work . second , to learn if the jets were powerful enough . Finally , Parviainen was seeking the answer to a basic question : " Is it possible to handle this , or is it going to be a disaster ? " Disaster did not strike . After he turned on his jets and fell away from the balloon , Parviainen 's wings filled with air and he started to glide . Before long , his jets were pushing him across the sky . " I started to follow my altimeter and I noticed already at 200 meters below the balloon , it started to be horizontal flying , " Parviainen said . " After that I followed the altimeter approximately half a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it . Parviainen had just become the first person to fly more or less horizontally using nonrigid personal wings , no wider than his arm span , for a significant length of time . However many modifiers one needs to describe the feat , humans had come one step closer to the dream of birdlike flight . Parviainen then tried to climb . As he raised his angle of attack , he felt his wings lose lift and he entered what could have been a deadly stall . But with more than 200 wingsuit jumps under his belt , Parviainen reacted instantly , diving to pick up speed and to let his wings regain their lift . He flew for a total of 2 minutes before opening his parachute . Parviainen made several more flights before it became too cold . This summer , he plans to be back , using new engines with nearly double the thrust-30 kilos each . The primary goal is pure fun , but he also hopes to fly longer and to achieve enough lift to climb . Eventually , Parviainen may tackle one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once he has jets strong enough , he imagines taking off from a cliff . He 'll have plenty of room to drop and open a canopy in case of trouble . But if all goes well , he will fly back to the cliffs edge to land . Some will say he 's crazy . But , he reasons , that 's what they told him about using jets . " You know those people-they ca n't imagine how it 's going to be possible . The truth is , when it 's done , they say , Oh , it 's done that way .
