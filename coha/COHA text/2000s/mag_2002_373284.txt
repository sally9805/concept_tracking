Before he caught United Airlines flight 93 from Newark , N.J. , to San Francisco on Sept. 11 , Todd Beamer was engaged in a kind of soul searching that we have come to think of as very post-9/11 . In Among the Heroes ( HarperCollins ) , New York Times reporter Jere Longman writes that Beamer was tired of leaving his family for business . He was working at home more often . He had postponed his sales trip by one day to spend time with his sons and planned , after a day 's work , to catch the red-eye home that night . <P> Instead , Beamer added " Let 's roll " to the patriotic lexicon when he and his fellow passengers attacked the hijackers , who intended to crash the jet in Washington . As they struggled , the plane went down in a Pennsylvania field , killing all on board . Flight 93 became the Warsaw Uprising of 9/11 , a national blueprint for resistance and a tonic against helplessness . <P> But another reason the story resonates so deeply is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sept. 11 , we 've told ourselves that facing our mortality changed our attitudes toward work and life . Yet here we are , still working in those office towers , still catching those planes . This is the paradox of our post-9/11 " reprioritizing " : America  --  credit-addicted , **36;14855;TOOLONG America  --  can not afford for us to examine our lives too closely . Our way of life is predicated on our not taking stock ; not getting off the **25;14893;TOOLONG hamster wheel ; not , God forbid , living each day as if it might be our last . Because who would spend that day in an airless cubicle or on the 8:30 to Denver ? We needed to believe that civilian , commuter-consumer life is heroic . And Flight 93  --  a weekday flight carrying largely business travelers  --  rendered the term " road warrior " literal for us . <P> Among the Heroes , based on voluminous interviews as well as cell-phone calls and black-box tapes from the flight , is a chronicle of that battle and a memorial to the fallen . There is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How close did they come to saving themselves and getting home ? And why , exactly , did these people fight back ? <P> Longman 's answer is reminiscent of the pre-9/11 business-strategy tomes that explain success in terms of combat and athletic metaphors . " These were people at the top of their game , " he writes , " who kept score in their lives and who became successful precisely because they were assertive . " They were company presidents , managers , writers . They played sports  --  baseball , football , rugby , judo  --  and drew life lessons from them . They believed in the moral value of work . They expected the best of themselves and others ( one passenger once went out to lunch and sent his cheeseburger back eight times ) . <P> These portraits are , like any obituary , colored by friends ' and families ' loving remembrances of the departed . But there is something else at work here . At times , Longman describes the passengers as if they were job candidates . They were " self-directed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could assess a situation and work in teams . " If this reads like Management Secrets of Flight 93 , in a way it is ; Longman is explaining these heroes using the terms by which the world measured them . ( And nearly a year and WorldCom later , it is heartening to see business skills treated as noble. )
