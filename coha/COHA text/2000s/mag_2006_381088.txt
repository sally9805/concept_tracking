If you 're looking for the novelist Joseph Finder in a tony Manhattan restaurant , ignore the artsy-looking , bearded fellow slouching in the corner and search instead for the man in full executive armor : tailored wool blazer , black Armani tie and blue Joseph Abboud shirt . Finder , 47 , uses that camouflage to slip in and out of the corporate environment , where he researches gripping thrillers set among the world of executive suites and water coolers . " Joseph Finder is doing for the business thriller what John le Carr did for the spy thriller , " says Malcolm Gladwell , author of The Tipping Point , " moving it from the level of simple genre to something more complex and ultimately satisfying . " <P> The typical Finder novel ( he has published seven so far , with 4.5 million books in print ) reflects three or four months spent deep inside a corporate culture . Like an anthropologist , Finder gets to know the natives , interviewing CEOs as well as the rank and file . For Paranoia , he lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at engineering powerhouse Cisco . Why do these folks open up ? Simple . " People like to talk about what they do for a living , " says Finder . That candor gives the novels an authenticity critics applaud . <P> For his fast-paced new book , Killer Instinct ( St. Martin 's ; 406 pages ) , Finder spent months interviewing staff members at technology giant NEC and other plasma-TV makers . The novel 's hero , Jason Steadman , 30 , is a sales exec at Entronics , a fictional Japanese-owned corporation . Although Steadman is a devotee of military-style business books , he 's no warrior on the corporate battlefield  --  until he meets Kurt Semko , a former special-forces officer who did a stint in Iraq . " He 's everything Gordy his boss and all these other phony tough guys pretend to be , " Steadman thinks . " Sitting in their Aeron chairs and talking about ' dog eat dog ' and ' killing the competition . ' Only he 's for real . He 's actually killed people . " Semko 's swagger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corporate ladder . It 's a deal with the devil , as Steadman learns . <P> A bit like his characters , Finder craved excitement in his career . After receiving a graduate degree from Harvard in Russian studies in 1984 , he planned to go into the CIA  --  until he discovered what the glamorous world of espionage really looked like . " It did not involve false passports or a trench coat , " Finder says ruefully . " It involved translating Soviet economic journals . " So he manufactured his own thrills on paper . After trying his hand at nonfiction , Finder wrote a succession of well-received thrillers , beginning with The Moscow Club in 1991 . <P> His breakthrough came in 2004 with Paranoia , set in a high-powered telecom firm in a fictional Silicon Valley locale . He followed Paranoia , his first New York Times best seller , with another , Company Man , about the old-line office-furniture industry . Finder had found his niche : John Grisham  --  like thrillers starring business people instead of lawyers . Finder is careful to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not corporate scheming , for their drama . " They 're not about high finance , " he says . " They 're a portrait of life in the corporate world , with regular people . "
