Evelyn Dixon <p> Later I would learn that that particular stretch of Interstate 84 , crossing from New York into Connecticut , is usually choked with traffic . But at one in the morning with only fifty miles to my destination , mine was the only car in sight , and I sailed down the empty lanes . It was n't until he pulled up behind me that I saw the state trooper and looked down at my speedometer . <p> Ninety . He had me . I called myself a name , shifted my foot from the accelerator to the brake , and started to pull over even before the pulsating strobe of colored lights filled my rearview mirror . <p> The patrolman was a nice-looking young man . If he had smiled he would have looked a lot like Garrett , but his expression was stony . Strange to be face-to-face with an authority figure young enough to be my son , but when he asked for my license and registration I obediently handed them over . <p> " Ms. Dixon , do you have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About ninety , " I said honestly . There was no point in lying when I already knew he knew the truth ; besides , I 'm a terrible liar . " I started out in Nashville this morning and decided to drive straight through to New Bern , but I was n't deliberately speeding . The road was clear , and I guess I just got lost in my thoughts . I did n't realize how fast I was going until I saw you . " <p> He looked at my license . " You 're from Texas ? And you 're driving all the way to New Bern by yourself ? " I nodded . <p> " What brings you here ? " he asked . <p> " It 's kind of a long story . " <p> Three days before , I 'd had no more thought of driving to New England than of becoming an astronaut and taking a trip to the International Space Station . <p> When the doorbell rang at exactly ten-thirty that morning , I knew who it was : Mr. Lindsay from Elite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message the day before saying that a Mr. Lindsay would be coming to give me an estimate and a date to pack my furniture and move it out of the house I 'd called home for the last twenty years . <p> Mr. Lindsay was wearing a pair of polished brown Justin cowboy boots just like Rob 's . He smiled broadly as he sat at down at my kitchen table , pulled a clipboard out of his briefcase , and started filling out paperwork . I disliked him instantly . <p> " And what address will we be delivering to ? " he asked without looking up . <p> " I do n't know . " <p> He lifted his head , his eyebrows rising to arcs of annoyance . " Mrs. Dixon , I ca n't very well estimate the price for your move if I do n't know how far we 're moving you . " <p> " Well , I 'm sorry about that , Mr. Lindsay , but I simply do n't know yet ! " I snapped . " And if that is inconvenient for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dixon ... well , I frankly do n't give a damn . It is n't like I invited you to come over here ! " <p> This outburst was so unlike me . For the last several weeks all I 'd been able to do was cry ; now here I was cursing at a complete stranger . I was shocked , but Mr. Lindsay did n't appear to be . Putting two and two together , his brows lowered and his face became a mask of practiced , utterly unconvincing sympathy . He had seen this all before . <p> " I 'm sorry , Mrs. Dixon . I was n't aware of the circumstances of your move . I know how hard this must be for you ; divorce always is . But please understand , I 'm just trying to help you . Now , it 's my understanding that the new owners are planning on moving in on the fifth , so that means you 'll need to be out of here by the end of next month . When do you think you 'll finalize your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I sighed . " I 'm looking at several condos in the area , but I have n't made up my mind yet . Not that it really makes much difference . They all look the same-fake granite countertops in tiny kitchens , white paint , four walls , sliding glass doors looking out onto a sad five-by-five square of concrete they call a patio . Each one is just as depressing as the one before . " <p> " You know , there is a complex we 've moved several ladies in your situation to , and they 've been very happy , " he said brightly . <p> " I see . You mean there 's a central depot for storing discarded wives these days ? Someplace where they warehouse the women who 've passed their sell-by date and been replaced with newer models ? How convenient . " There was no point in taking my anger out on this man , but I could n't help myself . It did n't seem to bother him though . He ignored my sarcasm and kept talking . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen Rolling Hills at River 's Edge ? If you 'd like , I could give Beverly a call and- " <p> I shook my head . " You mean the place over on Alamo Drive ? The place with no hills and no river ? No thanks . " <p> " Well , " Mr. Lindsay chuckled , " they might have been taking a little bit of literary license with the name , I 'll give you that . There are n't any real hills between here and Austin , but there will be a river . Beverly told me that they 're starting on the excavation next week . " <p> " A fake river ? " I laughed . " Thanks , Mr. Lindsay , but I 'm up to here with that sort of thing-plastic flowers , simulated wood-grain cabinets , planned communities , absent friends , false promises , broken homes . I want something real . I 've had enough of counterfeits , and , for that matter , I 've had enough of this conversation . " The legs of the chair made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to my feet . Mr. Lindsay looked surprised and a little confused . <p> " Mrs. Dixon , I know you 're upset , but we really do have to make some decisions here- " <p> " No . " I shook my head . " We do n't have to do anything . And I 'm not going to . Not today . I 'm sorry that you came out here for nothing , Mr. Lindsay , but this is still my home . " I could feel tears pooling in my eyes , but my voice sounded strong in my ears . " You need to leave . " <p> As I walked him to the front door and opened it , it occurred to me that I needed to do the same . <p> The next thing I knew , I was in the front seat of my car , heading northeast , and my suitcase was in the back . I really did n't know where I was going , only that I was . But by the time I neared the city limits , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I called his office in Seattle . <p> " Claremont Solutions . This is Garrett . " <p> " Hi , honey . It 's Mom . " <p> " Hi , Mom . Are you all right ? " Garrett is my only child . He 's a good son and has always been protective of me , even more so since the divorce . <p> " I 'm fine , sweetheart . I 've just decided to go on a trip , and I thought you 'd want to know . " <p> " Well , that 's great , " he said cautiously . " I 've been telling you to take a vacation for months now-anything besides sitting around the house and moping-but this is kind of sudden , is n't it ? Where are you going ? " <p> And suddenly I knew . " To New England . To see the fall colors . I 've wanted to go for years , but your dad never would . His idea of a vacation has always involved sitting on a beach and baking to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend the whole time hiding under an umbrella . " <p> My complexion has always been fair . Twenty minutes in strong sun can leave me with a nasty burn . But even after the dermatologist removed a malignant mole from my shoulder a few years ago , Rob continued booking our vacations in tropical locales . I knew I should n't subject Garrett to my acrimonious memories of his father , but sometimes it was impossible to swallow back the anger . <p> When Garrett took a job as a computer programmer all the way in Seattle after college , I was so disappointed . I 'd been hoping he 'd settle down closer to home , someplace where he could come home for holidays or drop by on weekends . Now I was almost happy that he lived so far away , too far to get caught in the fallout as Rob and I flung accusations at each other across a battlefield barbed with betrayal and lawyers . No matter how bitter I was , I never wanted Garrett to feel like he had to take sides in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mom , " Garrett replied , ignoring my commentary . " Do you know when you 'll be back ? Where are you staying ? " <p> " Actually " -I smiled to myself- " I have no idea . I guess I 'll stay wherever looks good and come back when I feel like it . " <p> I heard Garrett tap-tapping his finger against the telephone receiver . " Excuse me ? Operator ? Excuse me ? There must be some problem with this connection . I just thought I heard my mother , Evelyn Dixon , President of the Boy 's Club Annual Benefit Auction , as well as the Altar Guild , the Children 's Library Advisory Committee , the Neighborhood Association , and the foremost list-maker in all of Texas , say that she did n't have a plan . Someone must have crossed our wires . " He laughed , and I smiled . Even in my darkest moments , the sound of Garrett laughing has cheered me . <p> " I know . It is n't like me , but , as you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too well for me lately . I thought I 'd try being someone else , someone spontaneous and unpredictable . " <p> " I see , " Garrett said with a television therapist twang . " How 's that working for you so far ? " <p> " Well , I have n't even crossed into Rockwall County yet , so it 's a little too soon to tell . At the moment , I feel better than I have in quite a while , but it ca n't last . Right about now , your dad is being told by some moving-company cowboy that I kicked him out and refused to set a date to move , which means it wo n't be long before Rob will be calling my cell phone to ask if I 've lost my mind . " I chuckled . " I do n't know . Maybe I have , but do you think I should tell him ? " <p> " Do n't bother . Bet he already knows . I always did , " Garrett teased , and then his voice became more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to get back to work , but I think it 's great that you 're getting away for a few days . You 've got plenty of time before you need to move , so do n't worry about it . If it comes down to the wire , I 'll jump on a plane and fly out there to help you pack . " <p> " Thanks , honey . You wo n't need to do that ; I 'll be back in plenty of time to move , but I appreciate the offer . " <p> I hit the end button on the phone . Glancing into the rearview mirror across the pancake-flat landscape , I could see the downtown skyline marked by air-conditioned temples of commerce shrinking in the distance . I turned up the volume on the radio , drowning out the tinny , computer-generated version of " Your Man " that always played on my cell phone when Rob called , and kept driving northeast . <p> The young policeman stared , waiting for me to answer the question . <p> " What brings me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've always wanted to see the fall foliage . " <p> He nodded slowly , probably wondering if he should have me take a Breathalyzer test but apparently deciding against it . Maybe I reminded him of his mother . <p> " Well , I 'm sorry your vacation is starting off on a sour note , " he said as he wrote , " but as fast as you were going , I really do n't have a choice . " He tore the ticket off the pad and handed it to me . <p> " Welcome to New England , Ms. Dixon . " <p> Chapter Two Evelyn Dixon <p> Standing in the middle of downtown that day and turning in a slow circle , I decided that New Bern , Connecticut , looked exactly as a New England village should . I still think so . <p> The tallest building in town is the Congregational Church . It stands at the narrow , western end of the Green , an imposing fatade that dominates the landscape , as if anchoring the town to the Almighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " omnipresent . " With its evenly spaced doors and windows aligned beneath the exact center of a white wooden belfry , it is a monument to symmetry . Next to it , and painted in the same simple white clapboard as the church , stands a line of antique homes , probably from the late eighteen hundreds , on smallish lots . They are nearly identical , two-storied and rectangular in shape with wide porches and high-pitched roofs and , at least in comparison to the grand mansions that line the village 's main east/west residential street , Elm , rather modest . <p> The lots on Elm are large , some measured in acres instead of feet , and the homes sitting on them represent a variety of architectural styles-Colonials , Federals , Greek Revivals , and Victorians . Historic plaques on the homes list dates of construction stretching from pre-Revolutionary times to post-Civil War , the most recent having been built in 1902 . Walking down the sidewalk on an autumn afternoon , under a canopy of red gold maple leaves shot through with shafting sunbeams , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and morning coat , or a woman wearing hoopskirts and pulling on hand-tatted lace gloves , to open the gate in one of the white picket fences and wish you good-day . New Bern is a town with an active and powerful historic preservation society , and it shows . <p> There is little distance or demarcation here between residential and commercial ; people who live in town are within easy walking distance of New Bern 's businesses , a small but diverse collection of restaurants , galleries , antique shops , and boutiques housed in two-story brick storefronts with hand-painted signs . There is n't an inch of neon on New Bern 's main commercial street , aptly called Commerce . And even though the village shops clearly cater to the tourist trade ( you 'd be hard-pressed to buy a quart of milk or packet of shoelaces in the village ; all those mundane but necessary transactions take place in charmless cinderblock buildings along the state route leading out of town ) , there is a feeling of authenticity to the place . <p> Taking a quick walk around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of my day , I was pleased to see there was nothing too precious or souvenirlike for sale in the store windows , no T-shirts claiming that the wearer 's girlfriend , husband , or grandma went to New Bern and all they got was a lousy T-shirt , and none of the merchants had dubbed their boutiques a " shoppe . " I was looking forward to poking through the stores , but my rumbling stomach insisted that lunch come first . <p> There were three or four restaurants to choose from , and all of them looked nice , but I settled on a place called the Grill on the Green . Though it was still early , the restaurant was packed , and I had to wait for a few minutes to be seated . Waiting for my table , I noticed that while many of the customers were obviously tourists ( the shopping bags and cameras gave them away ) , the handsome , gray-haired gentleman who was seating diners greeted many by their first names , kissing the ladies on the cheek and exchanging hearty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant was a favorite of locals as well as visitors . It was easy to see why ; the atmosphere was elegant but relaxed , with brick red wainscoting running beneath walls painted a warm yellow . The simple black Windsor chairs looked cozy around the white-clothed tables . And the food ? To die for ! The chicken and endive salad I ordered was one of the best things I 've ever eaten . Normally , I hate eating alone ; it always makes me feel so conspicuous . But with the French patio doors at the front of the restaurant open to catch a warm , fall breeze , a pleasant buzz of conversation in the background , and a great glass of pinot grigio to sip , I found myself smiling for the first time in a long time . <p> The waitress brought me a cappuccino to finish my meal . " So , are you up from New York for the day ? " <p> " Texas , actually . I took a room at the Inn for a few days . I 've always wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she commented , looking at me with interest before placing the cup on the table . " That 's a long way . Well , you picked the perfect time for it . The weather 's beautiful . We 'll be packed this weekend , that 's for sure . " <p> " I noticed . Do you always have so many tourists ? " <p> She shook her head and put a ceramic container filled with pink , blue , and white sugar packets down near my cup . " We 've always got a steady stream of weekenders from New York , but we 're too far from the city to be a big tourist destination-not like the Hamptons or anything . Which is fine with me . " She grinned . " I went to East Hampton for the weekend once and I could n't wait to get home-too many people ! Here , we 're busy in the summer , and , of course , we get a lot of visitors now , during leaf season , but that only lasts a few weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three months ' time . Things get pretty quiet after that . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
