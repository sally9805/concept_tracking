Soldiers <br> <br> It was a day something like right now , dry , hot , and dusty dusty . It might ' a ' been July , I 'm not too sure , but it was July or August . Burning up , I wo n't ever forget . The Secesh Army , they came by first . The Officers on their horses , the Troops walking , some of them dragging the guns in the dust they was so tired . The Officers rode up in the yard , and my mistress told them to get down and come in . The colonel said he could n't come in , he was going somewhere in a hurry , but he would be glad to get down and stretch his legs if the good lady of the house would be so gracious to let him . My mistress said she most graciously did , and after the colonel had got down he told the others to get down , too . The colonel was a little man with a gun and a sable . The sable was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the colonel was a little boy who had got somebody else 's sable to play with . My mistress told me stop standing there gaping , go out there in the road and give the Troops some water . I had the water in a barrel under one of the chinaball trees . We knowed the soldiers was coming that way  --  we had heard the gun fire the day before , and somebody had already passed the house and told us if the soldiers came by be prepared to help in every way we could ; so they had put me to hauling water . All morning long I hauled water to that barrel . Now I had to haul the water out the barrel to the Troops out in the road . Buckets after buckets after buckets . I ca n't remember how many buckets I hauled . The Troops was so tired and ragged they did n't even see me . They took the gourd from me when I handed it to them , and that was all . After they had drunk , they just let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach and get it so I could serve another one . But they did n't even see little old black me . They could n't tell if I was white or black , a boy or a girl . They did n't even care what I was . One was just griping . He did n't look too much older than me  --  face just as dirty as it could be . Just griping : " Just left to me I 'll turn them niggers loose , just left to me . " When I handed him the water he held the gourd a long time before he drank , then after he had drunk he let the gourd hang in his hand while he just sat there gazing down at the ground . <br> But these was the same ones , mind you , who had told their people they would n't be late for supper . That was before  --  when the war was just getting started  --  when they thought fighting a war was nothing but another day 's work . " Do n't put my food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up and do n't give it away . I 'm go'n kill me up a few Yankees and I 'm coming right on back home . Who they think they is trying to destruck us way of living ? We the nobles , not them . God put us here to live the way we want live , that 's in the Bible . " ( I have asked people to find that in the Bible for me , but no one 's found it yet . ) " And He put niggers here to see us live that way  --  that 's in the Bible , too . John , chapter so and so . Verse , right now I forget . Now , here them Yankees want come and destruck what the Good Lord done said we can have . Keep my supper warm , Mama , I 'll be back before breakfast . " These was the same ones griping out in the road right now . <br> Before all them had a chance to get some water , I looked up and saw another one coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kicking that horse fast as his arms and feet could move . Hollering far as you could hear him : " Colonel , Colonel , they coming . Colonel , Colonel , they coming . " He went right by us , but the Troops was so tired some of them did n't even raise their head . Some of them even laid down on the ground when he went by . " How far ? " the colonel asked him . " I do n't know for sure , " he said . " Maybe three , four miles back there . All I can see is that dust way up in the air . " My mistress handed him two biscuits and a cup of water . He looked at that bread and water like he had n't seen food or water in a long time and he kept bowing and saying , " Thank you , ma'am ; thank you , ma'am ; thank you , ma'am . " The colonel hit his boots together and kissed my mistress on the hand , then he told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in the road to get to their feet , too . Some of them did like he said , but many of them just sat there gazing down at the ground . One of the Officers had to come out in the road and call them to attention . Even then they was n't in any kind of hurry to get on their feet . They started down the road , and I could hear that same one that had been griping before : " Just left to me I 'll turn them niggers loose , just left to me . " One of the other Troops told him shut up before he got both of them shot . Him for complaining , and him for being his cousin . He told him shut up or cousin or no cousin he liable to shoot him himself . But till they got out hearing distance all I could hear was that little fellow griping : " Yankees want them , let the Yankees have them  --  just left to me . " <br> After they had made the bend , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gourd . My mistress was standing on the gallery watching the dust rising over the field , and just crying . " Sweet , precious blood of the South ; sweet , precious blood of the South . " Just watching that dust , wringing her hands and crying . Then she saw me standing there looking up at her . " What you standing there for ? " she said . " Go fill that barrel . " <br> " What for , Mistress ? " I said . " Theygone now . " <br> " Do n't you think Yankees drink ? " she said . " Go get that water . " <br> " I got to haul water for old Yankees , too ? " I said . <br> " Yes , " she said . " You do n't want them boiling you in oil and eating you , do you ? " <br> " No , Mistress , " I said . <br> " You better get that water then , " she said . " A Yankee like nothing better than cooking a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them no ' count niggers at , I wonder ? " <br> " They went hiding with Master in the swamps , " I said , pointing toward the back . <br> " Stop that pointing , " my mistress said . " You ca n't tell where a Yankee might be . And you watch your tongue when they get here , too . You say anything about your master and the silver , I 'll have you skinned . " <br> " Yes , Mistress , " I said . <br> While I was standing there , one of the other slaves bust round the house and said : " Master say come ask that 's all ? " <br> " Where your master at ? " my mistress asked him . <br> " Edge of the swamps there , " he said . " Peeping round a tree . " <br> " Go back and tell your master that ai n't half of them yet , " my mistress said . <br> The slave bust back round the house , running faster than he did coming there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get that water . <br> The Yankees did n't show up till late that evening , so that little fellow who had spotted that dust in the air had a keen eye sight or a bad judge of distance . The Yankee Officers rode up in the yard just like the Secesh Officers did ; the Yankee troops plopped down side the road just like the other Troops did . I got the bucket and the gourd and went out there to give them water . <br> " How many Rebs went by here ? " one of the Troops asked me . <br> " I did n't see no Rebs , Master , " I said . <br> " Come now , " he said . " Who made all them tracks out there ? " <br> " Just us niggers , " I said . <br> " Wearing shoes ? " he said . " Where your shoes ? " <br> " I took mine off , " I said . " They hurt my foot . " <br> " Little girl , do n't you know you not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ai n't lying , Master , " I said . <br> " What 's your name ? " he asked me . <br> " Ticey , Master , " I said . <br> " They ever beat you , Ticey ? I ai n't a master , Ticey . You can be frank with me . They ever beat you ? " <br> I looked back toward the house and I could see my mistress talking with the Officers on the gallery . I knowed she was too far to hear me and the Troop talking . I looked at him again . I waited for him to ask me the same question . <br> " They do beat you , do n't they , Ticey ? " he said . <br> I nodded . <br> " What they beat you with , Ticey ? " he said . <br> " Cat-o ' - nine- tails , Master , " I said . <br> " We 'll get them , " the Troop said . " Ten 'll die for every whipping you ever got . " <br> " Ten houses will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields , too , " another one said . <br> " One of y'all sitting there , take that bucket and go haul that water , " the first Troop said . <br> " I better do it , Master , " I said . " They whip me if I do n't do my work . " <br> " You rest , " he said . " Troop Lewis , on your feet . " <br> Troop Lewis got up real slow ; he was tired just like all the rest . He was a little fellow and I felt sorry for him because he looked like the kind everybody was always picking on . He took the bucket from me and went in the yard talking to himself . The other Troop had to holler on him to get moving . <br> " What they whip you for , Ticey ? " he asked me . <br> " I go to sleep when I look after Young Mistress children , " I said . <br> " You nothing but a child yourself , " he said . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know , Master , " I said . <br> " Would you say ten ? ' Leven ? " <br> " Yes , Master , " I said . <br> " I ai n't a master , Ticey , " he said . " I 'm just a ' old ordinary Yankee soldier come down here to beat them Rebs and set y'all free . You want to be free , do n't you , Ticey ? " <br> " Yes , Master , " I said . <br> " And what you go'n do when you free ? " he asked me . <br> " Just sleep , Master , " I said . <br> " Ticey , you not the only one go'n just sleep , " he said . " But stop calling me master . I 'm Corporal Brown . Can you say corporal ? " <br> " No , Master , " I said . <br> " Try , " he said . <br> I started grinning . <br> " Come on , " he said . " Try . " <br> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> " Can you say Brown ? " <br> " Yes , Master . " <br> " Well , just call me Mr. Brown , " he said . " And I 'm go'n call you something else ' sides Ticey . Ticey is a slave name , and I do n't like slavery . I 'm go'n call you Jane , " he said . " That 's right , I 'll call you Jane . That 's my girl 's name back there in Ohio . You like for me to call you that ? " <br> I stood there grinning like a little fool . I rubbed my foot with my big toe and just stood there grinning . The other Troops was grinning at me , too . <br> " Yes , " he said , " I think you do like that name . Well , from now on your name is Jane . Not Ticey no more . Jane . Jane Brown . Miss Jane Brown . When you get older you can change it to what else you want . But till then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood there grinning , rubbing my foot with my big toe . It was the prettiest name I had ever heard . <br> " And if any of them ever hit you again , you catch up with me and let me know , " he said . " I 'll come back here and I 'll burn down this place . " <br> The Yankee Officers got on their horses and came out in the road and told the Troops let 's go . They got to their feet and marched on . And soon as my mistress thought they could n't hear she started calling my name . I just stood there and watched the soldiers go down the road . One of them looked back and waved at me  --  not Troop Lewis : I reckoned he was still mad at me . I grinned and waved back . After they had made the bend , I stood there and watched the dust high over the field . I was still feeling good because of my new name . Then all of a sudden my mistress was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> " You little wench , did n't you hear me calling you ? " she said . I raised my head high and looked her straight in the face and said : " You called me Ticey . My name ai n't no Ticey no more , it 's Miss Jane Brown . And Mr. Brown say catch him and tell him if you do n't like it . " <br> My mistress face got red , her eyes got wide , and for about half a minute she just stood there gaping at me . Then she gathered up her dress and started running for the house . That night when the master and the rest of them came in from the swamps she told my master I had sassed her in front of the Yankees . My master told two of the other slaves to hold me down . One took my arms , the other one took my legs . My master jecked up my dress and gived my mistress the whip and told her to teach me a lesson . Every time she hit me she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Jane Brown . She hit me again : what I said my name was . I said Jane Brown . <br> My mistress got tired beating me and told my master to beat me some . He told her that was enough , I was already bleeding . <br> " Sell her , " my mistress said . <br> " Who go'n buy her with them Yankees tramping all over the place ? " my master said . <br> " Take her to the swamps and kill her , " my mistress said . " Get her out of my sight . " <br> " Kill her ? " my master said . " Brown come back here asking ' bout her , then what ? I 'll put her in the field and bring another one up here to look after them children . " <br> They put me in the field when I was ten or ' leven . A year after that the Freedom come . <br> Continues ...                   @ @
