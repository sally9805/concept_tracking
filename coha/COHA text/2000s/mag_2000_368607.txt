Call her Mary the Oppressed . A senior sales director at a small business-to-business dotcom in New York City , she has been living in open-space hell . Arrived recently from a publishing firm , she is nearly 40 years old and had had her own office for 15 years . Now she found herself among 30 people , grouped according to job function , sitting at long tables arranged to form a rectangle in a 5,000-sq. - ft. room with a concrete floor and bare windows . <P> After a " hideous " six months , Mary says , " I just could n't stand it . My ability to focus went down so by Friday , I could n't concentrate at all . " When she made sales calls , the noise level was so high that potential clients would ask whether she was calling from the airport . Only after the company moved to new quarters , where she got a cubicle , did she decide to stay . <P> Who says the culture wars are over ? Political correctness is n't a big issue at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' 90s and beyond . What drives people up the wall is the issue of walls themselves , or the lack of them . In the early ' 90s , when flat organization structures , low salaries and the dream of an IPO captivated everybody , one symbol of the democratic capitalist revolution was the wall-less office , which brought together CEOS and corporate grunts in one big , happy , synergistic family . Andy Grove had  --  and still has  --  a cubicle ; Jay Chiat did n't even have that . The wall-less office ruled . <P> Well , there are n't as many IPOs these days . And there are n't as many fans of the open office either . One day last month , Cornell University 's William Sims visited two high-tech start-ups as part of his work for the International Workplace Studies Program , a group that researches innovative workplace strategies . One company was the 75-person software-design division of a larger firm ; the other was a smaller Web-design outfit . Each had or was planning an ever so hip open-office design for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sims heard the same struggle unfolding in each : the top manager was committed to the cool look that identified the outfit as a successful new-economy type ; the employees were demanding offices with walls and , gasp , doors . The manager of the first group was " worried , " says Sims , " that ' if I force them too much , they 'll go down the road . ' " The founder of the second company , Sims reports , felt staffers could " ' like it or lump it . ' " <P> Working in an environment with neither walls nor doors is an experience many now endure or , like business author Walt Goodridge , remember with dread . Goodridge recalls his seven years in the World Trade Center as a civil engineer for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey . " We occupied the whole 73rd floor , more than 200 people in cloth-covered steel cubicles . Sitting , you were alone ; standing , you could look directly into someone else 's cube . I fixed my computer so passersby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's phone conversations , and rumors spread quickly . "
