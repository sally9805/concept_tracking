Derek Mitchell lays out quite clearly the essence of U.S. security strategy for Asia , defining its basic principles and identifying the relevant policy alternatives accurately . Undoubtedly , this strategy reflects a lasting American interest in Asia . Indeed , it was this interest that drove the United States to enter Asia 's political , economic , and social arenas in the past century . And because of such persisting interest , Americans have fought historic wars in Asia , finally establishing the hegemonic stares of the United States and completely integrating Asia into the Western Pacific . Indeed , most Asians would agree with Mitchell 's characterization of the United States as " an active player , partner , and beneficiary " in the region . At the same time , another truth can not be ignored : despite a shared interest in maintaining peace and prosperity , Asians and Americans have different understandings both of their goals and the principles necessary to safeguard them . Without reference to these differences , any commentary on U.S. security strategy is shallow and unconvincing , lacking the thoughtfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region . In this article , rather than focus on specific disputes , I will examine four issues , through which I believe one can best understand regional affairs . Associated Rule versus Coleadership <p> The conflict between associated rule and coleadership is at the core of U.S.-Asian relations and is an important point at which cross-Pacific understandings of the regional relationship diverge . The United States seems to seek continuous predominance in shaping Asia 's future ; and , in pursuing its policy goals , to desire only " associated " efforts from its Asian partners . In the post-Cold War era , however , economic and democratic progress have produced a stronger self-consciousness among Asians . Consequently , they have recently begun to call for joint leadership in regional affairs . On some issues , they have even attempted to take a major role  --  for example at the historic summit meeting between North and South Korea in June 2000 and in the evolution of the ASEAN Regional Forum ( ARF ) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum . <p> As a status quo power , the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undermine its dominance in the region . Given that aim . Washington has to " influence distant governments and organizations on a variety of issues " to serve its long-term strategy ? But U.S. leadership and influence are not always benign and comfortable things for Asian nations . Their response to U.S. leadership , therefore , remains ambivalent , shifting from issue to issue . Sometimes they behave , quite rationally , as recipients of " peace profits " provided by the United States . In other cases , when they feel weak and vulnerable , and especially in times of crisis , they oppose  --  either overtly or covertly  --  U.S. predominance ( e.g. , during the Asian Financial Crisis ) . As younger leaders take power , frustration with Asia 's subordinate position is clearly mounting as evidenced by the increasing number of emotional statements made concerning the self-esteem of the region . As Asia copes with the forceful drive of globalization , an awareness of equity and the need for a greater sense of cooperation can be expected to grow significantly . It is thus reasonable to predict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time . Universal Principles versus National Interest <p> In an effort to shape the world order , the United States has persistently advocated the universal adoption of the Western values enshrined in its own sociopolitical principles and institutions . It perceives democracy and individualism as the two supreme doctrines that represent these values . As such , they have become a natural part of U.S. security policy for Asia . Nevertheless , U.S. efforts have failed to win the full appreciation of Asian nations over the past few decades . To the contrary , Asians have insisted that their own values , which stress uniformity and collectivism , also be respected and preserved . They argue that Asia can not sacrifice its stability to protect individual interests and rights . An indiscriminate adoption of Western democracy has proven counterproductive to the development of Asian societies . The more aggressively the United States pushes democracy , the more chaotic Asian societies become . Joseph Stiglitz , former vice president and chief economist of the World Bank , highlighted this view in his analysis of how the United States used assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations affected by the financial crisis . He writes : <p> In theory , the fund IMF supports democratic institutions in the nations it assists . In practice , it undermines the democratic process by imposing policies . Officially , of course , the IMF does n't " impose " anything . It " negotiates " the conditions for receiving aid . But all the power in negotiations is on one side  --  the IMF 's  --  and the fund rarely allows sufficient time for broad consensus-building or even widespread consultations with either parliaments or civil society . Sometimes the IMF dispenses with the pretense of openness altogether and negotiates secret covenants. ( n2 ) <p> Another source of dispute across the Pacific is the inconsistency of U.S. policy implementation . For Americans , foreign policy involves trying to accomplish varied objectives in a complex and recalcitrant world . This often entails tradeoffs . Cases in which the United States differentiated its human rights policy during and after the Cold War ( e.g. , Korea and Saudi Arabia ) illustrate that the United States has tolerated fights-abusive regimes because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such behavior substantially and adversely affects U.S. credibility , and Asians often cite it as convenient evidence of American opportunism . The Morality of a Hegemonic Leadership <p> In comparison to previous hegemons ( e.g. , Spain or Great Britain ) , the United States is much more progressive , not only in terms of economic productivity and scientific innovation but also , strikingly , in its construction of a multicultural civilization . However , it remains a civilization dominated by Anglo-Saxon culture and Christianity , and when it comes to justifying U.S. diplomacy , American idealism , informed by these civilizational values , often arouses suspicion elsewhere . In Asia , where Buddhism and Hinduism dominate , people believe in tolerance and self-restraint . They decline to convert themselves to what they view as self-centeredness and aggressiveness . The experience of ARF shows exactly how the United States and ASEAN possess separate security philosophies . The ASEAN countries insisted at the outset that ARF should , as a collective security institution , strive for wide agreements that rest upon regular multilateral consultations rather than focus on the enforcement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained that without enforcement mechanisms for areas of common concern , ARF was not a regional security regime worthy of its full support . As a result , Washington once threatened to withdraw from its dialogue partnership unless enforcement was enhanced . Although such overt disputes have subsided , the issue of providing an acceptable moral basis for U.S. hegemony remains unresolved and will affect not only the U.S.-Asian relationship but also America 's global role as a leader in the ongoing transcultural integration of the information age . Unilateral Security versus Mutual Security <p> Security is an interest pursued by all nations . As such , it should not be conceptualized in an absolute and exclusive way , but should be based upon a cautious assessment of security interests of other nations . If one nation seeks its own security at the expense of others , it will face a protracted security dilemma ( e.g. , Israeli policy toward the Arabs in the 1970s ) . In today 's world , because technology and know-how cross borders quickly and fluidly , no country is an isolated territory of peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can only be realized through positive interactions among all relevant parties . Should some states feel unsafe , others will be unable to achieve overall security and an enduring peace . <p> In reality , confusions caused by U.S. security endeavors are easy to find almost everywhere in Asia . An outstanding example is the recent debate between Asians and Americans over U.S. missile defense systems . Washington insists that these projects are aimed at potential missile threats from some rogue states in Asia . On the contrary , Asians including some U.S. allies allege that such a military build-up will further deteriorate the global strategic balance and endanger the security architecture that has been developed in recent decades . It will weaken not only current international regimes but also confidence in any security parameter of the future . <p> The four issues I have examined do not exhaust the areas of difference between Asians and Americans . However , they represent some problems in that relationship . In his paper . Mitchell neither identifies these issues nor sufficiently discusses them . Because of the obvious impact of U.S. strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other nations have justified concerns about how Americans evaluate the essence and ethics of their future leadership . They might also be curious about the extent to which U.S. strategic analysts recognize the different security concepts and practices of other countries . Answers to such inquiries will be important in determining how successfully the United States can retain widespread popularity among the nations it wishes to lead in the new century . <p>
