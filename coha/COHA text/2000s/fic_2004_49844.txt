MICHAEL 'S MOTHER WALKED INTO HIS ROOM and announced that she was going to supervise packing . " Let me get dressed , " Michael said . He was in his underwear . " We 've got plenty of time . " She made little fluttering motions with her hands and backed out of the room . They were the first couple to board the train . <p> His mother made a great show of inspecting the compartments , which were identical . She was a creature of habit , and dealt with travel anxiety by aggrandizing the minor dividends and setbacks of the journey . She seated herself by the window and patted the place beside her . " How peaceful this is , " she said . " Do n't these look new ? These seats ? " And so on . Her nose , small like her face and dusted in foundation , kept to its schedule of wrinkling and unwrinkling . <p> The train filled up . " You 'd think the airlines were on strike , " Michael 's mother said . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gestured for Michael to do the same . Michael watched the other passengers file past and thought that it might not be bad to have some company . A couple of teenage girls came and went , and as he often did , Michael glanced at them and quickly imagined them stripped of their baggy clothing : pale , smoothly lumped , awaiting trespass . <p> " But it is hot in here , " his mother said . She pulled her sweater off and the elaborate cups and bindings of her brassiere pressed against her peach turtleneck . Though demure in public , privately Michael 's mother spoke with a certain tender urgency about the state of her breasts . When he was a bit younger , she would face the mirror in her bedroom , disrobed to the waist , a glass of sherry in one hand . " They used to be so beautiful , " she would announce . " And now look at them-fallen . " For a brief time , Michael enjoyed a certain mysterious cachet among the older boys in his apartment complex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch facing her room . <p> " Are n't you hot , Mikey ? Take that ridiculous sweater off . " <p> " I 'm fine . " <p> " Wo n't Nana be pleased to see you ? I try to tell her how big you 've gotten , but it 's no good . She 'll have to see for herself . " She took his shoulders , one in each hand , and squared them . " And soon you 'll be off to college , wo n't you ? Two more years . What will we do then ? " Michael felt her fingers begin to massage , and he gently shrugged away from her and picked up his magazine . <p> " Will they bring us tea do you think , Mikey ? No . What am I saying ? This is n't Europe . " His mother pouted over this idea for a moment then leaned back into her seat . <p> From time to time , a passenger would pause in front of their compartment . Michael 's mother managed to marshal them along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , she sighed lavishly . Down below , the brownish grime of the Maumee River steamed and distant girders knit themselves in buildings . She sat beside him , smelling faintly of talc , the purse on her lap ticking with the train 's motion , the ball of her shoulder leaning against his with an unstated expectation of contact . Michael shifted and felt a damp layer of heat around his skin . His breathing seemed not quite the way it should be , too forced . He gazed at magazine rock stars and movie stars and wondered how long the trip to Gary would last . <p> The compartment door slid open and a chubby conductor appeared . The collar of his blue uniform pinched his neck to such a degree that his face was a rich , creamy pink . He doffed his small cap and held it before him . " Where you folks headed today ? " Michael 's mother presented their tickets . " Gary ? Fine city . Just you and your brother , ma'am ? " <p> Michael listened to her keening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official capacity-daffy , girlish . " What a nice man . " She slipped her shoes off and rested her stockinged feet on the seat across from her . <p> " What a fat man , " Michael said . <p> " Do n't say that now , Michael . You know very well that people store fat in their bodies at different rates . He ca n't help the way he looks . " <p> " Look at his pants . " A view was afforded of the conductor 's backside as he attended to the riders in the next compartment . <p> " Maybe they gave him only that one uniform , " she said . But Michael knew from her tone that she was n't angry , or even disappointed , was instead secretly approving of his hauteur . The world was often a nasty place . A fine sense of discrimination affirmed this , and it was nice to have someone with whom to share a quiet intolerance or two . <p> Only a few passengers boarded in Angola and the teenage girls departed , giggling as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time , wo n't we ? Not like at home . " Michael 's mother rested her head on his shoulder . " I do n't know what you do with the hours . When shall we eat , Michael ? Let 's eat now . I am hungry . Will you get the pastries ? " He stood and turned to grab the paper bag in the rack above her . As he rose onto his tippy toes , she set her hands on his hips to steady him . There was about the action a practiced intimacy . " Look how much you 've grown , " she said . <p> But then the train lurched and Michael stumbled against her and she let out a happy shriek and as all this happened-Michael drawing his knee into and away from his mother 's soft belly , she clinging to his belt loops , laughing , her forehead brushing his thigh-a third figure slipped into the compartment . <p> " Do n't let me interrupt , " he said . <p> Michael felt a thrilling , complicated dread and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wondered how long the stranger had been in the dark corridor , and whether he 'd been watching . " Excuse me . " Michael made a gesture , hoping to slide past him , back into his seat . <p> But the man was busy fumbling with one of several zippers on his jacket and his eyes were fixed on Michael 's mother . He had a large head of red hair and gave off a strong scent of cigarettes and sweated-over cologne . Moving with a deliberation that suggested slow-wittedness , he seated himself across from Michael 's mother . <p> She made quite a show of the pastries , jabbering on about the bakery and its blind proprietor , but did not acknowledge the man across from her , though their knees were an inch apart . " Have a bear claw , Michael , " she said . " This man , Gitlitz , told me they were the specialty . What a sweet little fellow . He had a special cane . With a hook for opening the ovens . Is n't that clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rustle of waxed paper and moist chewing . " They are good , are n't they ? " Michael 's mother reached out with a moistened finger and dabbed a flake of pastry from the fine hairs of his moustache and brought this to her own mouth . <p> As if in response to this action , which Michael found humiliating , the stranger placed a hand on her knee . " Please allow me to say hello . My name is Chaleaux . William Chaleaux . I hope you 'll feel comfortable calling me Billy . " <p> " Hello , " Michael 's mother said . She glanced at his hand . <p> " Where are you folks headed to this evening ? " <p> She said nothing , her face reddening , and shifted her knee away . <p> " Gary , " Michael said . <p> The man sat back and nodded and drew a pack of cigarettes from one of his pockets . He looked disarmingly content , swaggering in stillness . His coat was thin vinyl disguised as leather-that 's what all the zippers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed out of fashion a few years ago , absurdly baggy but drawn at the waist and decorated with signs intended to radiate the dull glow of neon , each reading MIAMI BEACH . . . NEVER GETS DARK . <p> Michael had never been to Miami Beach , but knew his mother and father had met there on some long-ago vacation . He could remember his father saying , " How ' bout you give me the Miami Beach treatment tonight , Marj , " or words to that effect , and his mother laughing in the way she did when embarrassed , little tiffs of air , and shoving him away . <p> The stranger lit up . Owing to the light , or perhaps the vigorous way in which he inhaled , the smoke swirled with a milky thickness . <p> Michael 's mother coughed . <p> " Not much of a city , Gary . You all have family there ? " <p> His mother coughed again . <p> " Oh , I get you , " the stranger said . " Smoke 's bothering you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sinatra ? all right , I 'll take it outside . " He turned to Michael . " Save my place , would you kid ? " <p> His mother batted the air with her arms . " What a repulsive man . " <p> " You want to move ? " <p> " Of all the compartments on this train . Repulsive . " <p> Billy Chaleaux was repulsive . His cheeks were tracked with scars , and the heavy folds over his eyes made him look sleepy , primitive . Sharp gray teeth showed between his lips . He looked untended to , beyond tending . " We can move , " Michael said , knowing they would not . <p> " I 'll bet he does n't even have a ticket . " His mother began stuffing papery remains into the pastry box . <p> The stranger slid open the door . " We were talking about your family , " he said , seating himself . " Ca n't imagine why you 'd want to go to Gary otherwise , with all the niggers they got there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Midwest . " <p> Michael 's mother said , " That is in no way appropriate- " <p> " Oh sure . I know , I know . " The stranger made his eyes round with remorse . " It 's terrible to speak like that , to have those thoughts about another human being . You 're right . But the truth is I was the victim of a crime and it 's made me bitter , I suppose . Where are you from , folks ? Akron ? Toledo ? Toledo it is . Well , what about that downtown you got there ? Full of them . The Adam and Eve , you know that place ? Sure you do . Your son 's probably seen it a thousand times , all them drunken jigs hanging around outside like the sidewalk was built to hold them up . " <p> Michael wondered if the stranger had ever been inside the Adam and Eve , a place he pictured as full of red light and beery mist and shiny black tits . His mother turned to him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I got you , " the stranger said . " No offense intended . Not to a nice-looking woman like yourself . Nor to your son . Fine-looking boy . He got your lovely green eyes . Off to see family , I 'm guessing . Grandma , is that it ? A real family tableau . " he traced the air with his index fingers , framing them , and flashed his little gray dagger of a smile . <p> Though he said nothing for some time , the stranger looked at Michael 's mother intently . While this caused her a great and obvious discomfort-she angled herself away and began jabbering about the lakes of the Upper Peninsula-Michael pondered what he might be seeing : an attractive woman in her midthirties , hair bound into a bun , conservatively dressed , but not so conservatively as to lose the contours of her figure . She looked like a naughty librarian of the sort encountered in pornography , a woman of compressed desires . The stranger 's inspection seemed to bear this out , linked them somehow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brotherhood of men , then drawn back to his mother : delicate , broken-hinged , now hidden behind a magazine . <p> " Thing about Gary , ma'am , is that it 's a dry county . You ca n't buy the hard stuff there . Not that you 'd have an immediate interest in such things . But with any family gathering , I 've found , it 's never a bad idea to have the option . You 've got to head down to St. John or Crown Point . Did you know that Capone once had his world headquarters right there on Jersey Street ? Over a Chinese laundry . Used to have guys rubbed out by drowning them in washers . Clean-corpsing , they called it . Then he headed down to Miami , of course . " <p> " Where is that crossword book ? " Michael 's mother rose from her seat and began rummaging in the shopping bag overhead . Billy Chaleaux surveyed the length of her inseam and whistled softly and raised his eyebrows at Michael . <p> She turned and glowered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly you think you are , sir- " <p> " I 'm William Chaleaux , " he said . " I wish you 'd call me Billy . Now please do n't get angry . Please . There 's no need for that . You ca n't really blame me , can you ? To admire a woman of your beauty , you ca n't blame a man for that . Your son knows . See , he forgives me . He 's a lucky kid . Lucky . You must do some sort of exercise to keep in the shape you do . No question about it . Not that you 'd look any worse with a little more , not at all . But you must do something . Do you run ? Or those aerobics classes ? " <p> " She swims , " Michael said quietly . <p> His mother fixed him with a murderous look . <p> " Swimming . Even better . Exercises the heart and the muscles . Lengthens the muscles . None of that shaking up the internal organs . " <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy our ride in peace , Mr. Chaleaux . I hope you can understand that . " <p> " OK , ma'am . I get you . Sure . Trains are peaceful . They move us like when we were inside our mamas , that same motion , what you want to call amniotic motion . Lots of folks feel that way . They get on a train and they like to enjoy some peace and quiet . " His tone was patient but oddly displaced , as if he were reciting a script . " But you know , for me , it 's just the opposite . I get kind of jumpy . Perhaps this is on account of my own upbringing and the way my mother moved us around all the time . You can never be sure , can you ? " <p> Michael 's mother offered a wan smile . " I 'm glad you understand . " <p> " I 'll maybe just toodle off and get myself something in the dining car . Either of you folks want anything ? My treat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car on previous trips . His mother , however , insisted the food was overpriced . He imagined sandwiches , steaming slices of pie , hearty stew . " Thank you , no , " his mother said , tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear . <p> " All right , then . Your son does n't look so pleased about that . But you 're the boss on these things , are n't you ? " <p> Michael 's mother waited for the door to slide shut . " Why do you speak to a man like that , Michael ? just to provoke me ? " <p> " It slipped out . Look , I asked if you wanted to move . We can just move . " <p> " Do n't be silly . " <p> " You could speak to the conductor . " <p> " And say what ? " <p> " You know , whatever . That there 's some creep who 's bothering you . Find that fat guy . He seemed to like you . " <p> A familiar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get such ideas ? OK , I 'm going to the little girl 's room . I 'll check . Honestly , Michael . " She returned with a fresh coat of lipstick , her bun reknotted . <p> They were past Sturgis and headed into Elkhart when Billy Chaleaux returned . He moved loosely , his great head bobbing , his zippers tinkling . The seat across from Michael 's mother was layered with magazines . These he stacked neatly and removed to the seat beside Michael . He then withdrew a brown bag from his coat and set it down atop the magazines . " Picked up a slice of apple pie for the kid , if he 's so inclined . It 's a bit gluey . But tasty . Good crust . " <p> " Thank you , " Michael 's mother said . " That was kind . " <p> " Sure . No problem . I did n't want you to suppose that I was n't thinking about you . I sure was . A nice mother and son like yourselves , a good-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? " Billy Chaleaux shucked his coat and sat in the place he had made for himself . He wore a combed cotton T-shirt-what the kids at Michael 's school called a " wifebeater " - and his freckled biceps bunched when he curled his arms . He had the look of a boxer gone slightly slack . On one forearm was a monstrous tattoo . Michael stared at this straggled design , bluish , nearly purple , and Billy Chaleaux held it out for him to inspect . What on first glance appeared an octopus was in fact a woman whose eight arms held a man in a distorted posture of sexual congress . His mouth was a tiny circle and his hair flowed in all directions , as if he were being electrocuted . The legend beneath read LOVE ME EIGHT TIMES in crude blue letters . " Ca n't tell you where I got that , " Billy Chaleaux whispered . " But it 's a place your mother might know . " <p> She looked at him sharply , her lips tensed . <p> He held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just mean that it was a place over in Toledo . I forget the name . Down by the river , behind the Sheraton . All the sailors used to hang out down there . Now do n't get yourself in a tizzy . It 's just a figure of speech . I only mean it 's a place for adults , for the things adults do . " He picked up a magazine from the seat and began thumbing through it . " Would you get a load of all this , " he said and whistled again . " What sort of youth culture magazine is this ? I do n't remember there being all this kind of skin in Rolling Stone . " Chaleaux held up a picture of a thick-lipped young woman in a bra and panties . " Is this how girls at your school dress ? Lord help us . " <p> Michael 's mother cleared her throat . " I really would appreciate it if you held your opinions to yourself . " She turned her head and settled into a feigned sleep against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered . " I got you . " He flicked at the picture with bony , yellowish fingers . " You suppose they 're real , kid ? " <p> Michael shrugged . <p> " You ever seen a fake pair ? I 'll bet you have . Nice-looking kid like you . More and more girls get that operation , do n't they ? With this new stuff , the saline . It 's become like a regular part of the growing up process . " <p> Michael 's mother opened her eyes and looked at Billy Chaleaux . " I 'm not sure what point you 're trying to make , but my son and I did n't ask for you to join us or to make those kinds of statements . " <p> " What kind of statements ? " Billy Chaleaux touched his chest . He was back to the script . " Your son and I are talking a bit , that 's all . These are things that have to do with being a guy . Guy things . " <p> " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Well now , I ca n't argue with that , mom . all right . Now do n't get angry at Billy Chaleaux . I mean no exact harm here . Maybe I had one or two beers there on the dining car , just to loosen up . I 've been under a lot of pressure lately . That 's not your fault , but just the same . " He bowed his head and his eyes disappeared behind the prominent lids . " I hope you wo n't take offense . " <p> Outside , the tire plants of Niles pumped black smoke against the low skyline . <p> " It was nice of you to get that pie , " Michael 's mother said , as a kind of compromise . " That was kind . " <p> " It 's important to be kind , I think , " Billy Chaleaux said . " I like to take care of the people I 'm fond of . That 's the truth . A man who 's been through what I have learns about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I see . " <p> " Those comments about that girl in the magazine , the little girl with her dressed-up bosoms , those were just a between-men thing . I 'm sorry if they offended you or kept you from sleeping . A woman as beautiful as yourself needs sleep . I hope you wo n't mind my saying this . " Billy Chaleaux flicked off the light on the door of the compartment and sat again . The pattern on his trousers fluoresced slightly so that words appeared in the loose-hanging folds . NEVER . DARK . " I only point to a picture like that because a boy of your son 's age has certain thoughts , certain preoccupations . Pretending otherwise is really no solution . That creates all kinds of pressure , which could result in things like juvenile delinquency . Not that Michael , a boy like Michael , would be involved in that . It 's only the motives I 'm speaking about . Denying certain kinds of thoughts . I think we all know what those would be , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Michael expected his mother to say something , perhaps to get up and leave the compartment . But Billy Chaleaux continued to speak , growing more serene , conveying a smooth inevitability . The sorts of words he used changed , and his inflection flattened out , as if he were studied in the art of disguising his voice . " Nothing unnatural at all . Not at all . Even if he did n't think these thoughts during the day , they would come to him at night . He would think those thoughts that young men think . Who knows exactly what he thinks about ? The specific images and so forth . That 's just his business , in the end . I know what I 'd be thinking about , mom . With just the two of you in that house . " <p> Michael 's mother said , " Stop . " <p> " But you ca n't hide a child forever , can you ? A boy 's desires are perfectly natural . We all have desires . " Billy Chaleaux was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got some in there , mom , underneath all those long skirts and hairpins . A woman like yourself . " <p> She issued a distressed sound , and Michael said : " She wants you to shut up . Shut up . " <p> " Oh sure , I know . I need to shut up . And you two need to get on with this family vacation of yours . Sure , Mike , you 're just defending what belongs to you . There 's no harm in that . Your mom sounds pretty upset and maybe kind of worried too . She has every right to worry , Mike . Every right in the world . She does n't know what I might do . She 's seen enough in her life , more than you might imagine , and she ca n't help but worry . She 's probably thinking about when the conductor might come by . But she knows he 's not going to come by on this train , the red-eye out of Detroit . He 's supposed to . Says so right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Gary and there 's no more stops on this line . He 's in that warm little room they have for conductors , shooting the shit with the others , talking about what he 's going to do for the holiday . He might have some coffee , or cocoa maybe . Your mom could get up and try to find him , but I think she 's a bit too spooked , Mike . She does n't want to leave me alone with you , and she does n't want to drag you and all that luggage to some other crowded compartment . She does n't know what I might do , I think . When you live a certain kind of way for a long time-any kind of way-it gets hard to adjust , to do things differently . What I mean is this : when you live in fear , fear becomes anything you look at . " <p> " Such a philosopher , " Michael 's mother said . Her jaw muscles bunched . " We did n't realize you were such a philosopher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoing her irony . " I 'll tell you what your mom 's really afraid of : she 's afraid that you 'll try to do something to save her , that you 'll attack me or something , Mike . She 'd like that , really , a certain part of her . But another part of her is scared to death . Her mind tells her she 's just being a good mama , worrying about her boy tangling with some loudmouth stranger on a train . It 's more than that , though . She 's not really afraid you 'll get hurt . She 's afraid you 'll do just fine , and afraid of what would happen afterwards . Because then , I think , it would be obvious what you deserved . " <p> Michael sat , clenching and unclenching his fists . He considered his options-fetching the conductor , attacking the man , yelling threats at him-but all these seemed absurd . Billy Chaleaux was n't really doing anything . He was just talking . <p> And the more he spoke , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elaborate , his eyes looking hooded and ancient in greenish shadow . " She 's sort of trapped , Mike . Both of you are . I think I might recognize that . There might have been something in the way you two conducted yourselves . Getting onto this train in a town like Toledo , first ones on , ca n't afford to fly , car in the shop , taking this late train because it 's the cheapest ticket , and making sure you 're the first ones on so you can choose a place and protect it , so you can ride along with your shoulders brushing in the dark . Setting out all these things tomake the place look full , a full house . It 's a certain kind of mentality . " <p> Michael 's mother said something under her breath , which Michael did not catch . Billy Chaleaux said , " Yes , I know , mom . I 've heard all those words before , filled my mouth and released them into the air . You need to cash some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , mom . That young man who did so much wrong to you so long ago : how do you forgive a man like that , who wo n't stay put or do what he 's told ? How long has that man deserved punishment ? And you-you 're still a young woman . Vibrant . Alive . There are things you deserve . Not just money or comfort , but things in the way of flesh . " <p> " If you so much as lift a hand- " <p> " No , no , " Billy Chaleaux said . He spoke as if his words were plucked from a dream . " That 's not what this is about , mom . You know that . Violence does none of us any good . It 's just a place you move towards or away from . There 's nothing in it that lasts . Mike knows that . We have a lot in common , Mike and me . I look at him and I see a younger version of myself . I hear you make that noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we have more in common than you 'd like to think . We have our thoughts about you , for instance , and we have the night , and we have whatever might happen in the night . These are not small things and time will only make them larger . Mike ca n't stay around forever , after all , dressing and undressing in that room next to yours , taking showers , walking around in his summer tank tops , both of you struggling to lift that large , unnameable need onto the other . How do we undo need , mom ? Loosen its hold ? I 'm asking a question here , a serious question . " <p> Billy Chaleaux pulled a cigarette out from the zippered coat on the seat beside him and put it between his lips . He flexed his arms , and the muscles ran along them like small animals . " He 'll have to leave . You know that . It 's just something that men do to you . And once he 's gone , he 'll never come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring you flowers and gifts and some insufficient bride . But he 'll never really be back , like it was before , just the two of you . And that need . " <p> Michael 's mother was gazing out the window . The distant lights of Gary shone on her small face . She was not weeping . From what Michael could determine , she was trying instead to assume a posture of boredom or disinterest , which he tried to mimic . <p> " Now listen , " Billy Chaleaux said . " I need to smoke this cigarette , because I 'm addicted to the damn things . This is one of my needs . And I know you do n't like to have smoke all over your clothing and hair and skin-because there are things you would like to touch your skin , but smoke , my smoke , is n't one of them-so I 'm going to head down to the dining car . But before I do that , I want to take another look at the two of you so I can sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure I do n't look like a man who would go in for that kind of thing . I doubt someone like you , mom , would give me that much credit . But it 's not difficult to make a picture in my mind . " Chaleaux closed his eyes and let the cigarette dangle from his lips as he spoke . " I can see the both of you together on this train , leaning into each other in a darkened compartment , feeling the motion of the cars and the heat of one another 's bodies , that heat that merges after a time . You 're looking away , mom , out the window . But not in this picture I have in my mind . In this picture I 'm thinking of , you 're looking at your son , your only son , your firm , handsome , sweet-smelling son . And I almost know what you 're thinking , what your exact thoughts are , how you would like certain moments of your life to never end . " <p> Billy Chaleaux rose slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curious formality , folded his jacket over his arm . He opened the door to the compartment and slipped through . <p> Michael thought about how best to dismiss the man , with a curt comment , maybe , or a murmured curse . He thought about apologizing to his mother for not throwing Chaleaux out of the compartment . He tried to envision himself comforting her . <p> She was still staring out the window , at snakes of smoke and lowslung black shapes , factories filled with sooty men . <p> " He was crazy , Mom . Drunk and crazy . " <p> His mother only shook her head . She slumped in her seat , her mouth hanging slightly open , her eyes smudgy , unfocused . <p> The train was slowing , pulling into the steel berth of the Gary station , where Michael 's grandmother would meet them , swallowed up by her shabby coat and smelling of rosewater . For three days she would fret over them , in the yellow , knotted warmth of the apartment she could no longer quite manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hug them a bit too long and they would get back on the train and return home . <p> Michael stood and began to lift the luggage down from the overhead rack . " We 're here , " he said . <p> " Yes . " <p> " We should get going . She 'll be waiting . " <p> His mother nodded and extended her hand , bent primly at the wrist . Michael felt her fingers on his palm . He lifted her to her feet and she weighed nothing at all . The skin around her mouth , which she moisturized each night with ardent little dabs of cream , had grown thin and papery . He could see the pale slashes of scalp where her hair was pulled tight . Her eyes were delicate cups of ink . <p> She stood and now Michael could feel her buckle against him , and certain pictures came into his mind-of his mother at a different age , swollen and pink with her desire-and his body stiffened and she pressed against this stiffness , her soft belly pressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and settled on the small of his back . He wanted to pull away from the heat of her . But she was holding him there and his body was responding and he knew then that Billy Chaleaux was watching them from outside the compartment , that he had been watching them all along . <p> " Do n't grow up to be a man like that , " she whispered . " Michael . Promise me . " <p> Michael felt his mother shudder against him and his body responded with a fierce happy motion . She gasped a little . He thought about the arms of Billy Chaleaux : thick veins and muscle , threaded ink . His mother wanted to step back , but Michael held her-held her easily-and their bodies were together in the darkness . He bent down and the soft whiskers of his mustache brushed against her cheek , which was damp , and he squeezed her body one final time and waited until her breath was shallow and urgent and hot on his ear before answering , " Yes . I promise . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
