Dusk was falling last Tuesday when news of the attack on America first reached this war-ruined city , Kabul . In the dusty twilight , Afghans held radios to their ears , listening to static-filled accounts on the Voice of America and the BBC Pashto- and Persian-language services . Because the country 's Taliban rulers forbid television , Afghans could see no pictures of the destruction that had people everywhere else glued to their sets . The immensity of the World Trade Center had to be described . When Afghans asked me about the Twin Towers , I compared them to Afghanistan 's giant Bamiyan Buddha statues , a symbol of national heritage that the Taliban blasted to dust six months ago . <P> The immensity of America 's agony , however , required no explanation . More than 20 years of war have heightened Afghans ' empathy for the suffering of others . " The attack on the U.S. was very bad . It killed innocent people , ordinary citizens , " Zalmai Khan , a housepainter , said sadly . " Why must so many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't matter who they are ; they all have a mother and a father . " Many said they believe that Osama bin Laden , whom the Taliban treats as an honored guest , is a liability and should be expelled from Afghanistan . But the Taliban has little intention of giving up bin Laden . " He was a friend in a time of need . It would be very much cowardly to leave him at this stage in his life , " Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmad Muttawakil told me . <P> And so Kabul is bracing to pay the price for that hospitality . " Will America send rockets and bombs to hit Afghanistan ? " some residents asked anxiously . In Islamabad , the Taliban ambassador to Pakistan issued a warning . " If any regional or neighboring country helps the U.S. attack us , " Abdul Salam Zaeef told reporters , " it would draw us into a reprisal war . " <P> After so many years of war , Kabul , formerly a cosmopolitan capital , has become a city of grinding poverty , distrust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy-handed religious police . Residents have learned to live alongside an array of the Taliban 's so-called foreign guests , including Arabs , Chechens , Kurds , Uzbeks and Pakistanis  --  all believed to be in Afghanistan for secret military training . In the 1980s , Washington fueled Afghan resistance to the Soviet invasion by passing billions of dollars of covert aid to mujahedin fighters . Once the Soviets pulled out , the mujahedin turned on one another , and the country descended into civil war . When the Taliban  --  a band of warrior students  --  swept into Kabul five years ago , it imposed a ruthless Islamic rule . It brought peace to the city , but the world was outraged by its practices , including public executions and a ban on work for women and schooling for girls . Music , TV and photographs were prohibited , and men were forced to grow beards . <P> Among those evacuated last week were relatives of two American aid workers on trial here , accused of preaching Christianity . After traveling 10,000 miles to a country where few dare to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an uncertain fate . Waiting to board a U.N . plane for Islamabad , Deborah Oddy , mother of Heather Mercer , 24 , wore a black head scarf and sobbed uncontrollably . Since the Soviet invasion in 1979 , this country has seen more than its share of tears . Now the frightened residents of Kabul are worried that this latest incident will bring on even more .
