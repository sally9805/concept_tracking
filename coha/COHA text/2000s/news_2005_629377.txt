<p> GLEN ROSE - To calculate the size of a Dutch Oven Gathering , or DOG , you count pots of food . At 38 pots , a recent Saturday lunch at the Tres Rios River Resort &; RV Campground here broke no records.That honor belongs to a gathering held in Madisonville last year : 75 pots . People still talk about it . <p> Even so , this lunch was nothing to sneeze at . Here is a sampling from the menu : <p> Homemade tamales . Venison swiss steak with peppers . Pork loin with cornbread dressing , sweet potatoes and pineapple . Corn quiche . Lasagne . Pork loin with raspberry chipotle sauce . Cherry-glazed and stuffed pork loin . Biscuits . Sourdough biscuits . Dinner rolls . More biscuits . More pork . Sam 's theory is , anytime we have one of these DOGs , you got to kill a pig , " said Lone Star Dutch Oven Society member Joe McMordie of Elgin . The Sam in question is Sam Miller , a talkative , friendly fellow and society trustee . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-legged cast-iron Dutch oven , over and under burning coals . There was lots more , though the Food Pyramid gang might wish for some vegetables : bayou beef with rice . Tex-Mex stew . Turkey breast with gravy . Hawaiian chicken . Indian chicken . King Ranch chicken . Sweet potatoes with marshmallow cream . Beer-braised stuffed brisket . Cowboy potatoes . Peach cobbler . Cherry-cheesecake cobbler . Cherry pie . Pecan pie . Bread pudding times two . <p> As he cast his eye over the magnificent spread , R.D. Mork of Jacksboro joked , I 'm going to call my heart doctor to make reservations . " <p> 5-inchers to mammoth pots <p> It 's probably impossible to say who invented the Dutch oven , but Paul Revere is thought to have had a hand in their early manufacture in this country . Lewis and Clark and countless , nameless pioneers carried them west . Today , they come in a variety of diameters and depths from 5-inchers , useful for melting butter , to mammoth , capable of holding 20 quarts and weighing some 45 pounds empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special commemorative one , too , in honor of the 2002 Winter Olympics , for instance , or the Lewis and Clark expedition . <p> A single Dutch oven is a virtual batterie de cuisine . Coals on top and ingenious , hand-rigged inside racks turn them into ovens - hence the name . They can also steam , smoke , roast , boil and fry . You can stack four pots on top of each other and cook that way . <p> They say you can cook anything in these ovens that you cook at home , " Jim Bratcher of Lewisville told me , except a waffle . " He got that wrong . Tom and Jeanne Raykovich of College Station make waffles in theirs . Nothing to it . <p> Earlier this year , the society lobbied successfully to have the Dutch oven proclaimed Texas ' official state cooking implement , a totally awesome " accomplishment , according to the group 's recent newsletter . Texans are said to be tough and resourceful . If there 's any pot you could describe in the same terms , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody cooked in Dutch ovens , the pot did n't need a society to promote it . But nowadays gourmet cooks lust after All-Clad and Calphalon and dream of braising and brleing in Viking stoves . With the possible exception of the Boy Scouts , longtime practitioners of Dutch oven cooking , the pot was in danger of going the way of the Republic of Texas . <p> The society got its start in 1994 . In the beginning , members gathered to compete , a natural enough idea . Texas has its share of chili and barbecue cook-offs , and there 's an annual World Championship Dutch Oven Cook-Off based in Utah - a state which , incidentally , claimed the Dutch oven first , declaring it the state cooking pot in 1997 . <p> Nonetheless , competition did n't sit well with the Texas Dutch-oven crowd . As Houstonian Gale Merriwether , LSDOS president , remembers it , Duane and Sandy Dinwiddie , also of Houston , are the reason we do n't have cook-offs anymore . Nobody could beat them . " The couple remain the state 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep because the society eliminated competitions in 1996 . Its slogan , Fun , Food and Fellowship , " tells you most of what you need to know about its focus today . <p> That just adds a layer of stress that we do n't want , " Jeanne Raykovich said . We 're willing to share recipes . We 're willing to teach you how we 're doing this particular method . What we 're really trying to do is promote and keep alive the old method of cooking . We want to do everything we can to encourage people . And I think competitive cooking may discourage them . " <p> She paused , then added in a conspiratorial whisper , These guys still compete . It 's still there . But it 's not official . " Today , there are 21 LSDOS chapters across the state and seven out-of-state chapters with a combined membership of about 400 . This year 's June-through-December calendar lists 24 DOGs and demonstrations . Among the group that convened in Glen Rose , the Texas accents were thick and sweet as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk , " downpours were frog-floating weather , " and the food so good it 'll make you slap yourself . " The men , especially , were charming jokesters and tellers of tall tales . Over the course of the weekend , U.S. troops and the Aggies got support , and one or two people happened to mention that Ronald Reagan was their favorite president . <p> As a group , you wo n't find a nicer bunch , " said Longview resident and society officer Jim Lewis . We do n't get into squabbles and arguments , fussin ' or fightin ' . " <p> A communal kitchen <p> Members began to converge on Glen Rose for their statewide gathering on a Friday afternoon . They immediately broke out their Dutch ovens , setting up clever , idiosyncratic chuck-wagon stations with handmade cutting boards , tools and tables under the campground 's roofed pavilion - making , in effect , a large , communal kitchen . A classic ranch bell announced dinner . By 8:30 p.m. , all that was left were pots scraped clean , the faint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the evening meal . A lemon pound cake , in particular , received high ratings . When I admired a glowing pumpkin carved with bat , moon and witch stirring a steaming cauldron , I was informed that the cauldron was , in fact , a Dutch oven . <p> Early Saturday morning , the group was at it again , fixing a 20-pot breakfast , including biscuits ( always biscuits ) , sourdough rolls , homemade tortillas , eggs of every imaginable sort , marmalade bread , cinnamon rolls and blueberry pastries . Everywhere you went , people refilled your coffee cup from big , enamel-coated percolators and fixed you up with sugar and creamer . Cooks tended to their pots and swapped recipes , cooking methods and stories . <p> There are several ways to maintain a steady temperature while baking in a Dutch oven . Some cooks hang a chart on their chuck box with pot size and the number of coals needed to reach a given temperature . Say you 've got a standard-issue 12-inch pot and you want to bake biscuits at 400 degrees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 under the pot and 10 on the lid , which has a raised ring to keep the coals in place . Humidity , altitude , sun and the number of times you turn the pot , a quarter turn each time , also affect the cooking . <p> There are some formulas , " Miller conceded , but it 's just experience . For instance , hold your hand about four inches over the pot and see how long you can keep it there . Count to 12 . Then it 's 400 degrees . " <p> Neighbors Harley Mills and Dwayne Hill , from Wichita Falls , were attending their first Big DOG . A sign behind their chuck box read , When I got home , my wife said , Take me somewhere expensive . ' So I took her to the gas station . ' " Their wives , by the way , were at home . They are not into this , " Mills said , but his son Steve , a Boy Scout troop leader , had joined them . <p> Some members are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little far gone . Merriwether has 22 Dutch ovens . It starts with a single pot , Darrell Williams of Plano warned visitors Tammey and Mo McKinney over lunch . The couple , who happened to be camping at Tres Rios while the group was holding its gathering , had , by coincidence , recently purchased a Dutch oven . That secured them a lunch invitation to the Big DOG . ( Actually , almost anything can get you an invitation ; this is nothing if not a welcoming group . ) <p> It starts with one 12-inch pot , " Williams told them . If you 're going to do two dishes , say vegetables and meat , you 've got to have two pots . Now you have two pots , you 've got to have something to put the pots and equipment in . You 've got to have a chuck wagon . To put the chuck wagon in , you need a trailer . For the trailer you need a truck . <p> That one pot , " he concluded , begat all that . " Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one of the younger members , and he favors all-natural ingredients , such as organic chicken stock . Others take shortcuts , using canned pie filling or doctoring up refrigerator biscuits . <p> It 's not the fact that you are cooking from scratch . It is the fact that you are cooking in the oven itself and you can turn out anything , " said Mary Merriwether , Gale 's wife . You might as well make it easy so you can make it fun , so that you can visit . You do n't want to spend all your time in the kitchen cooking . " She laughed . <p> Everybody has their own cooking style , " her husband said diplomatically , but it all tastes good . " <p> No disagreement there . <p> I like barbecue . I love barbecue , " Williams said Sunday morning over a final 12-pot breakfast of eggs , crme brle french toast , apple oven pancakes and sausage-and-egg pizza . The crowd was thinning out . With barbecue you know what you are going to get . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Texas toast . That incredible smorgasbord of earthly delights we had yesterday that went across the entire spectrum of foods ? " Williams enthused . The only common denominator " - he tapped his Dutch oven - is this .
