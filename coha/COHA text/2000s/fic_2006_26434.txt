The scream awakened Khorii from a deep and well-earned sleep . Swinging her feet out of bed , she stood for a moment , disoriented , trying to determine the source . Had she dreamed it ? But , no , there it was again . Childish , high-pitched , feminine , and -- invasive . It was in Khorii 's mind as well as in her ears . Sesseli ! She ran for the door to her room and tripped over the cat . " Khiindi Kaat , please move , " she said to the smallish , fluffy , gray-striped cat who gave her an offended look . After all , she had assaulted him just when he was setting about on his errand of mercy to see what was making his friend Sesseli scream like that . If only these stupid bipeds did n't find it necessary to put doors in one 's way . Khorii lifted him with her hoof and moved him to one side so she could open the door . Finally ! Khiindi thought . He sprinted out ahead of her down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the charming **27;0;TOOLONG Sesseli , an orphan from Maganos Moonbase . Khorii yanked open Sesseli 's door and ran in , expecting to find the child injured at the very least . Possibly worse . Instead , Sesseli was standing at herrain-streaked window , which overlooked the former town square of the mostly deserted city of Corazon . Khorii thought at first that perhaps a thunderclap or a particularly close bolt of lightning had frightened the child . But in that case , would n't she be backing away from the window instead of crowding close to it ? Besides , the soundproofing in the dormitory was excellent , and Khorii herself had n't heard any thunder . The monsoon outside sounded like nothing more than the patter of rain on her own window . " What is it , Sess ? " she asked , using thought-talk so as not to startle the child further . Khorii was an expert at thought-talk -- all adult members of the Linyaari were . Khorii 's whole home planet routinely communicated that way . Sesseli , though human rather than Linyaari , was herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was a member of the very young crew of the Mana , a supply ship whose crew and former owners had all died in the recent space plague with the exception of Jaya , the captain-in-training . The captain now in charge , former astronavigation instructor Asha Bates , was right behind Khorii , entering the room so fast she stepped on Khiindi 's tail . With a yowl that made Sesseli jump , Khiindi hop-ped on the bed , out of the way of clumsy feet , and from there was scooped up by Sesseli , who buried her face in his fur . " It moved , " the child said . " It moved all by itself . I did n't make it , honest . " " What moved , sweetie ? " Captain Bates asked , stepping around Khorii to join Sesseli at the window . " That . The marker , " she said , pointing . The former city square had become the final resting place for masses of the plague victims , each huge grave marked by a plascrete stone with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too far gone to be identifiable , some other identifying object -- a ring , a watch , an amulet or scrap of clothing . The names of those who could be identified before burial were also attached . For fear of the horrible disease that had swept the galaxy , these dead could never be given more individual burials , but at least any surviving descendants who showed up later would be able to learn the fate of their relatives or friends . It was the best the children and mostly elderly adults remaining in Corazon , as in other stricken areas , could do for the less fortunate . " It is probably just the rain , Sesseli , " Khorii said , trying to reassure her . " It got muddy enough around the marker to loosen its moorings and it slipped . " " Or could it have been looters ? " Captain Bates asked . " Maybe they were messing around there and destabilized the stone , so it shifted as the ground settled or something . That could have been what you saw , pet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know about , " Hap Hellstrom said from behind Khorii . Like the others , Hap was part of the Mana 's crew . All of them except Jaya had boarded the stranded supply ship while it orbited Maganos Moonbase , forbidden by the school 's administrators from landing . The school on the moonbase and all the students and teachers as well as the moonbase 's managers , Khorii 's human grandfathers , Calum Baird and Declan Giloglie , and their wives , were fine . The rescue party from Khorii 's home planet , Vhiliinyar , had , with her help , scoured the moonbase and its nearest world , Kezdet , eradicating all traces of the plague , which had not yet become entrenched there . Paloduro , the planet of which Corazon was the chief city , was where the plague had seemed to originate . It had been cleansed by Khorii 's parents before they became so exhausted they contracted a mutant form of the illness , which made them carriers . They had returned to Vhiliinyar with their human friend Captain Becker , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his android first mate Maak , creator-father of Khorii 's android friend , tutor , protector , adopted brother , and often her main source of annoyance , Elviiz . Elviiz , who had appeared in the doorway beside Hap at the same time as Jaya , said , " I will go there now and determine the validity of Captain Bates 's hypothesis . " He did n't always talk like that but just after he recharged , he always seemed to express himself in that annoyingly **122;29;TOOLONG way . But in this case he was making himself useful , so Khorii did n't mind . She sat on the bed and pulled Sesseli and Khiindi into her lap , then she laid her horn against Sesseli 's fluffy blond head . The short golden spiraling horn in the middle of her forehead allowed Khorii and other Linyaari to heal trauma , pain , injury , and illness to a degree that seemed miraculous to most humans .
