<p> Chicago 's fabled architecture has always been catnip for filmmakers . Remember that car 's specta- cular swan-dive from the Marina City parking garage into the Chicago River in Steve McQueen 's " The Hunter " in 1980 ? Kevin Costner 's encounter with a runaway baby carriage on the Union Station staircase in 1987 's " The Untouchables " ? Tom Hanks driving down La Salle Street toward the Board of Trade in 2002 's " Road to Perdition " ? <p> It 's an extra level of pleasure for local moviegoers , who get to see our city ( and sometimes our own neighborhood hangouts ) on the big screen . But " The Lake House , " the romantic drama starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock that opens Friday , takes Hollywood 's love affair with Chicago architecture to a new level . <p> READY FOR ITS CLOSEUP <p> Written by Chicago native David Auburn ( best known for his Pulitzer Prize-winning play " Proof , " also set in the Windy City ) , " The Lake House " takes full advantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the diversity of periods and styles . <p> " Every great architect from Frank Lloyd Wright and Louis Sullivan to Mies van der Rohe has built in Chicago , and what other city in America gives you all those buildings in close proximity to each other ? " says " Lake House " production designer Nathan Crowley , who also used several Chicago locations in last year 's " Batman Begins . " <p> " Sometimes you go to a city like New York and you feel its greatness , but cinematically , it does n't stack up like Chicago does  --  it 's very , very cinematic , " Crowley says . " And when the story itself is about architects , how could you do better ? " <p> Accordingly , the film 's Argentinian director , Alejandro Agresti , and his Canadian cinematographer , Alar Kivilo , lavish shot after shot on some of the city 's best-known architectural vistas , from the Chicago River and its lattice of bridges to the skyline as seen from the Grant Park softball fields . <p> They also zoom in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( using an unusual down-and-southward perspective on the Picasso sculpture ) , Holabird &; Roche 's Old Colony Building , the Artist 's Cafe in Solon Beman 's Fine Arts Building , and interior and exterior shots of Daniel Burnham 's Santa Fe Building and Adler &; Sullivan 's Auditorium Building , whose great reading room for Roosevelt University students doubles as a design studio . <p> But " The Lake House " goes well beyond using Chicago landmarks as a series of backdrops . More than any film since 1949 's " The Fountainhead , " it features architecture as an integral part of its story and the controlling metaphor for its themes . <p> ' Le Corbusier meets Wright ' <p> It 's about Alex ( Reeves ) , a promising Chicago architect who has devolved into what his estranged father , played by Christopher Plummer as a frosty but high-minded postmodernist architect in the mode of Philip Johnson , calls " a sleazy condo developer . " ( In the time- and market-tested way of Hollywood , Alex ultimately rediscovers his calling to create more than what another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If architecture is what separates Alex from his father , it 's part of what binds him to Kate ( Bullock ) , something of an architecture buff who falls in love with him during a romantic walking tour of Chicago neighborhoods . <p> The film 's architectural obsession even manages to reinforce Auburn 's central conceit of time travel . In its most poetic visual trope , the movie features a series of montages of ornate 19th and early 20th century buildings standing side-by-side with glass-and-steel modernist monoliths  --  a subtle but effective visual symbol of the lovers ' co-existence in separate but parallel timeframes . <p> Most daringly for a wide release , perhaps , Auburn 's script includes a fair amount of dialogue relating to architectural practice and theory . Alex critiques the glass-walled house of the title ( which Crowley designed and built at nearby Maple Lake as a Miesian glass box with romantic Regency touches ) as being " about ownership , not connection " ; his younger brother , also an architect , calls it " Le Corbusier meets Frank Lloyd Wright . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Richard Meier , or ponder the qualities and architectural implications of natural light in an art museum in Barcelona vs. one in Tokyko ? <p> ' All kinds of questions about architects ' <p> Fortunately , the film seems to come to its architectural focus from a place of genuine interest . Aside from Crowley 's impressive knowledge of Chicago 's architectural history , even the actors  --  particularly Reeves  --  spent a surprising amount of time soaking up information on the subject . <p> We know this , in part , from the experience of Wilbert and Marilyn Hasbrouck , owners of the Prairie Avenue Bookshop on South Wabash , who were contacted by a location scout about the possibility of using their store in a scene for the film . <p> " They were doing some filming on the street in front of us , and one day this young lady came in and said Sandra and Keanu were going to have a scene where they were looking at books in a shop , " recalls Wilbert Hasbrouck , an architect and architectural historian whose The Chicago Architectural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) came out last year . " She asked if they could use our bookshop , and I said yes . " <p> The next day , however , the woman returned with a message from Reeves , who wanted to talk to someone about architects , their practices and especially their vocabulary . Hasbrouck , a devoted raconteur with more stories in his vest pocket about Chicago architects than anyone else on the planet , volunteered for the job . <p> Arriving for lunch at the Four Seasons , Hasbrouck proceeded to enlighten the actor for an hour , after which the pair retired to Hasbrouck 's nearby apartment , where they chatted for another three hours . <p> " He was the most polite , courteous and sincere young man you 'll ever meet , " Hasbrouck says of Reeves . " He asked all kinds of questions about architects , and even made notes . It all seemed to be very interesting to him . " <p> In the end , the book-viewing scene was shelved , but Agresti , who had checked out Prairie Avenue on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's study . After several days of preparation ( in which the crew built a fireplace out of cardboard and what Hasbrouck calls " those little railroad tracks the camera rides on " ) , the director shot Reeves and Plummer 's emotional " sleazy condo developer " scene there . <p> ' INCREDIBLY NICE ' <p> " Keanu was incredibly nice to us  --  he 'd even offer to bring Marilyn coffee , which she does n't drink , " Hasbrouck says . " He 'd ask how the various takes went . By that time , I knew how the scene was supposed to go , and I 'd say , ' Well , you forgot to say that line , ' and he 'd say , ' Oh , you 're right . ' " <p> The result is a film that , while hardly the final word on Chicago architecture , treats it with respect and brings it into a pop-cultural context . <p> " We 're proud of our building and its architectural legacy , and the movie helps us show it off a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative services at Roosevelt , which owns the Auditorium Building .
