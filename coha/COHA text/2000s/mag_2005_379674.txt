With the insurgency in Iraq growing and the death toll for the U.S. military nearing 2,000 , the White House has been struggling to frame the war in a way that will evince patience . At summer 's end , President Bush gave a trio of speeches equating the war on terrorism to World War II  --  given that both pitted freedom against " a murderous ideology . " He compared Iraq last week to yet another conflict that enjoyed bipartisan support . " Islamic radicalism , like the ideology of communism , contains inherent contradictions that doom it to failure , " he declared . A White House official involved in preparing the 40-min. speech said it was designed to describe the enemy more precisely than in the past : " The attacks may be senseless , but they all fit together . " <P> In sweeping language that critics called hyperbole , Bush defined terrorism as being much broader than al-Qaeda and warned that militants have vowed to establish " a radical Islamic empire that spans from Spain to Indonesia . " Bush , who rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this kill-or-be-killed speech , which he had planned to give on Sept. 12 but postponed because of Katrina . To the dismay of aides  --  some White House wordsmiths , including Michael Gerson , had been working on the remarks since July  --  the news coverage dwelled on two sentences about 10 plots Bush said the U.S. and its partners had foiled . " I would n't have even had that mentioned in the speech if I had known that it would detract from the bigger picture , " one aide said . It was a reminder to the President 's men that when it comes to Iraq , the spotlight does not always shine where they aim it .  --  By Mike Allen
