As a novice , Maria Elena Gonzalez wanted to be a " kitchen sister , " just like the sister she admired . That was not , however , what was in store for her . Still , she wanted to be with the people , to work in a parish . She did work in Guatemala for a while . Later , she was happy serving the people of Lubbock , Texas as diocesan chancellor when she was called to have a still larger impact : to become the first woman president of the Mexican American Cultural Center in San Antonio . The center serves as a cross-cultural education center for theology , pastoral ministry , leadership , and language studies . In recent years both Gonzalez and the center have concentrated on training leaders for a wide variety of multicultural communities . She is known for her workshops and lectures on " Parish Restructuring in Multicultural Communities " and " Heart Speaks to Heart " Engaging the Ethnic Voices . " A consultant to the U.S. bishops ' Secretariat for Hispanic Affairs and member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Encuentro 2000 , the large national Catholic gathering July 6-9 in Los Angles that focuses on diversity in the church . The previous three national Encuentro gatherings were focused specifically on the concerns of the Hispanic Catholic community . The theme for this year 's Encuentro , however , is the multicultural challenge for the whole church . Why this change ? Far me-and this is part of a larger theological framework  --  the challenge of the gospel has always been the same : That all may be one . As Saint Paul puts it , " There is no longer Jew or Greek , there is no longer slave or free , there is no longer male or female ; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus " ( Gal . 3:28 ) . Jesus told us that the first commandment is to love God above all , but the second one is to love your neighbor as yourself . Photograph // That is where I would base this approach of the Encuentro , which I believe is not just an event , but a way of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love my neighbor if I do n't love myself . And to the degree that I am human , to that same degree will I be holy . And that is true for all of us , for the whole church . A new way of being church ? Not really . We have always been challenged to do this , particularly after Vatican II . But perhaps our diversity has not always been as challenging as it is now . Encuentro 2000 makes sense because we are finally challenged to look at our reality honestly . In the late 19th and early 20th centuries , in the midst of big waves of immigration , we did not have to be concerned with this because we had national churches and each group was more or less comfortable in its own community . I believe national churches are no longer appropriate for this time . I do not believe we are called to be separated as Hispanic , Polish , Filipino , or Irish . We are called to be one . It may be comfortable to have national parishes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not being a eucharistic church . For a large group of us , who are Mexican Americans born in the United States , being one makes lots of sense because we have never known any other church . We have always been a minority in the Catholic Church of the United States . Some immigrant groups have different experiences because they were always a majority in their own countries , so they might feel they can continue to be separate . But I think the experience is that increasingly we do not want to be separated , we want to be part of the many faces of the one God . Unless we get into the system , we are always going to be left out . Wo n't that mean mere assimilation ? Do n't different groups have a right to preserve their own identity ? For many years some Mexican Americans have misguidedly resisted assimilation , and that has led to segregation , less education , and therefore less opportunity . As a result , many doors have not been open to us because we did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one point , and now some want to punish us for not speaking Spanish any longer . But I do n't think that to become part of the system you need to lose your identity . Virgilio Elizondo put it very well in The Future Is Mestizo ( University of Colorado Press , 2000 ) when he said that the great novelty of the Christian message is that we do n't have to be either-or any longer . We can be both-and . We can be hyphenated Americans : Mexican-Americans , Italian-Americans . And in the same way we can be mestizo  --  Christians . Elizondo says , " In this process no one ceases to be , but all are enriched . All have to die to their exclusivity , but no one will simply die . On the contrary , all will become richer in the process . " Does the term " mestizo-Christians " apply only to Hispanics who have adapted to the dominant culture ? No . I mean that all Christians are called to do this . And this is difficult . When I give workshops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the " Heart of Multiculturalism , " I do n't so much stress multiculturalism as the heart . Does each one of us have the heart to deal with our own diversity ? What I am basically asking is : Do we have a heart that is open to conversion ? Because a change of heart has to happen . Otherwise , we ca n't have a diverse family . I see it in my own personal family , where we have intermarriages-we have to go through a conversion of heart to accept what our nieces and nephews are doing and the intermarriages that are happening . Do we have the heart to be open to that ? And , of course , this is not just happening in my family ; it 's happening in every family . Every family is being called to look at diversity , especially related to ethnicity and race . Some groups that try to look at diversity do things like explicitly welcoming every single cultural group in their parish or diocese  --  except the Anglo group . Dioceses have " Offices for Ethnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asians , and Native Americans-everyone but the Anglo group . Is that the way ? Certainly not . That is one expression of the mind-sets that are obstacles to a true transformation of the church . These mind-sets do not apply to every person or group , but they are often strong enough to hinder progress . There are certain mind-sets among dominant groups , such as the one you just described , that are harmful not just to the minority groups , but to the dominant culture as well . The problem there is that the dominant culture is not aware of its own culture , is not in touch with its own cultural heritage . When that 's the case , how can it understand others ? What are some of the other barriers to diversity in the church ? There is another mind-set in the dominant culture that sees those with a conscious and different cultural heritage as " the problem " : They are the ones who have to have a special Mass using their own language and customs . They are the ones who have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This mentality wants people to adapt to the dominant culture , which it sees as normative . This is dangerous because it is very divisive . Another assumption there is that the church belongs to the dominant group . That is actually taking the table away from its rightful owner-Jesus and his " abba " ( father ) - and reserving the right to invite to the banquet whomever they see fit , not everyone as Jesus would . It also means that the dominant group may be equating being Catholic with being American . And that is denying the very meaning of the word catholic . Because we are a catholic , a universal family , all are welcomed into the family . In fact , the more diversity we have in our parishes the more catholic we are . You 're really talking about conversion . But who has to convert ? Everyone does . Not just the dominant group . Minority groups also have some mind-sets of their own that can become huge obstacles in the process of becoming one . A low self concept , which some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may lead to fatalism , to self depreciation , to thinking that the American way is the best and only way , or to seeking comfort in the safety of their own place , without mixing with others . We all need to change these attitudes . We need to change the way we think about God , about ourselves , and about each other . That is at the very core of the Christian message . If we are made in the image and likeness of God , we can not afford not to accept ourselves and others . After going to grade school in a barrio school , I was one of only three Mexican Americans in my class in high school . We were frequently discriminated against , and all my confidence and feeling of self worth just went out the window . We were never good enough for anything , and those messages were always there . This continued when I entered the Sisters of Mercy as a novice , and some of the other sisters made fun of my accent and considered me to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compounding my low self-image , and I struggled with that . I realized that either I could become better or bitter . And I chose to become better . I did n't know what I was choosing , but I knew that I wanted to be a good Sister of Mercy , and that meant being a truly alive sister . That struggle was hard , but I had to do it . Because in a situation of oppression or injustice-or in any situation you need to change-you can not wait for the other person or group to convert , as if you had nothing to do with the problem , or as if you were the healthy one . We both have to change . We can not afford to be martyrs for the rest of our lives . If I am willing to tell my story of pain , I have to be willing to let go of it . Sometimes we use our pain-the pain of minority groups who have been wronged in so many ways  --  as a club to hit people over the head with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead us anywhere . And so , when we make the choice to be better , we make the choice to let go . You like to say that being church means being a eucharistic people . What do you mean by that ? I mean that the Eucharist is the focal point of our communities . We gather around the table as a family-as brothers and sisters of Jesus and of each other  --  to celebrate our hope in God and in each other ; to break open the Word of God for our everyday lives ; to be nourished so that we might be faithful to the Word in our everyday living . Eucharist is about family around the table . The Eucharist , however , can not be contained in the hour of Sunday Mass . I can not be a brother or a sister on Sunday morning unless I am a brother or a sister all week long . Is Eucharist a countersign to the normal divisions of the society around us ? Tolerance of those who are different in ethnicity or cultural background for one hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different cultural or ethnic groups for one hour is not the family of Jesus gathering around the table . To be a eucharistic people on Sunday morning demands that we be involved in the process of becoming a eucharistic people all week long . Eucharist is being and acting in community with all peoples . To be a eucharistic people means to understand that it is Jesus and his abba who are holding the banquet . The table belongs to them , andwe are all invited guests . To be eucharistic is to be thankful with our whole being that we have received an invitation . To accept the invitation is to accept sharing the eucharistic banquet with all other invited guests of Jesus , regardless of their cultural or ethnic backgrounds . We do not control who receives the invitation . We can only control our choice : to sit at the table with all others or to skip the banquet . Where would you start to get people into a process of conversion so that all can become truly eucharistic people ? By listening to all the stories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they are not saying . Photograph // Listen , listen , listen , and invite . People can not disagree with each other 's stories , but they can learn a great deal about others by listening . Then I would invite people to look at their passion : What would they be willing to die for ? From there , we could write our mission statement , the strategies for what kind of community we want to be . That might lead us to perhaps celebrate multicultural liturgies or to have a particular group be in charge of one particular day or Mass and invite the rest of the community to join in . It might lead a whole community to celebrate one Easter in the Vietnamese style and then Our Lady of Guadalupe with the Mexicans and then Saint Patrick with the Irish . What is most important , however , is that everyone be involved in the planning . Otherwise it can not be owned by all the others . Everyone has a right to the same opportunity for leadership development and to have representation on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll also need to name and confront the racism and cultural stereotyping that exists in our parishes and dioceses . It 's hard , but only by naming can we acknowledge , only in acknowledging can we face the truth . Only in facing the truth can we forgive and ask forgiveness . And in the process of conversion we will change and our parishes will change . Sounds like it 'll take a long time . And that 's what we have : time . We have been fighting with each other for 2,000 years ; it 's time for us to stop . When I talk about culture , I always use the image of an iceberg . The external cultural expressions are just the tip of the iceberg . We have to go deeper to understand the deep values and the common faith of the people . But does n't the church call us to be " countercultural , " to set ourselves aside from the culture ? No . The church wants us to be countercultural to the " no-God culture . " However , all our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heritage and values , and most of them are grounded in faith . Take something like Saint Patrick 's Day . It might seem very secular , but it has religious roots . Or the curanderismo  --  the popular healing and folk-medicine rituals-that many Mexicans practice ; it has very spiritual roots . The point is to discover the underlying values , to understand their meaning , and to purify them . But I also think that , as we listen to and understand each other 's cultures and become a truly eucharistic church , we become paradoxically both deeply countercultural and cultural at the same time . There is no faith expression outside of culture . There is no way to authentically and deeply express our faith without bringing to that expression who we are-what we value , how we think about God , each other , and the stranger  --  without our cultural heritage . Without our cultural heritage , without ourselves in our very faith expression , we have nothing more than empty words and meaningless gestures . It is in doing this , in being deeply faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face of a culture that denies God . Embracing our own and others ' cultural heritages , deeply respecting and loving all those differences , is the only way in which we can be church . And that is really what being Catholic means .
