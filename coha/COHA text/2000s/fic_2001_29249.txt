Steak Tartare Barbara D'Amato If you drive north from Chicago along Lake Michigan , you will pass through several increasingly wealthy suburbs . The first and oldest is Evanston . Then Wilmette , Kenilworth , and Winnetka . Winnetka is one of the richest municipalities in the United States . It may be that the average income in Kenilworth , nestled next to it , is higher than Winnetka , but Kenilworth is so small that it hardly counts . Basil Stone had therefore been thrilled to be hired as resident director of the North Shore Playhouse , located in Winnetka . It was n't Broadway , of course , but it was a very , very prestigious rep house . And you rubbed shoulders with nothing but the best people . Like tonight . He spun his little red Lexus around the curves of Sheridan Road , which ran right along Lake Michigan and therefore was the Place des Vosges of Illinois , rue de la crme de la crme , the street that accessed the highest-priced real estate in an already high-priced area . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the east , which meant beach frontage , of course , and was far tonier than living across the road . These things mattered to Basil . Pamela had given him the street number and told him to watch for two brick columns supporting a wrought-iron arch and elaborate iron gates . And there they were . He swung in , spoke his name into the post speaker , and the gates majestically opened . God , the place wasa castle . The drive wound in a lazy S up to a wide pillared veranda . Pamela stood on the lip of the veranda like a midwestern Scarlett O'Hara , framed among acres of flesh pink azaleas that swept away on both sides of the fieldstone steps . " Welcome , Basil , " she said , giving him a quick kiss on the cheek . He pulled back fast , not wanting her husband to see . Although everybody hugged and kissed when they met , did n't they ? It did n't necessarily mean anything . She drew him in the front door . Basil stopped just inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A tessellated marble floor flowed into a great entry hall , stretching far back to a double staircase , which curved out , up , and in , the two halves joining at the second floor . The ceiling was thirty feet overhead . The chandelier that dimly lit the hall hung from a heavy chain and was as big as a Chevy Suburban turned on its end . Basil looked around , found that they were alone , and whispered , " Pamela , I do n't think this was such a good idea . " " Oh , please ! " she said . " Do n't be so timid . " Timid ! He did n't want her to think he was timid . He was bold , romantic . Still ... " But what if he guesses ? " " He wo n't . " She patted his cheek , leaving her hand lingering on the side of his face . Just then , Basil heard footsteps coming from somewhere beyond the great hall , and he backed sharply away from her . Pamela laughed . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face the man who had just entered . " Darling , " she said , " this is Basil . Basil , my husband Charles Falkland . " Gesturing with his drink , Charles Falkland said , " I know she 'll make a wonderful Kate . " " I 'm very grateful that she wanted to do the show . With her background in New York . Of course , Pamela is a brilliant actor . And as Kate , she has just the right combination of bite and vulnerability . " " Absolutely , " Falkland said , placing his hand on the back of Pamela 's neck possessively . " She is extremely accomplished . " Basil studied the room , taking time to answer . Must be cautious here . " Of course , you know we 're an Equity house , so all the actors are professional . They 'll support her beautifully . " " But why The Taming of the Shrew ? " " You 'd rather we did a drama ? Do n't you feel that it 's important for the general public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People are so deadly serious . " " Well ... " Falkland said , drawing the word out , " some issues in life are serious , of course . Are n't they ? " " Of course , but " " But enough of this . Drink up and let me just mix us all a second drink . " Falkland busied himself with the bottled water , lime , and lemon wedges that the butler , Sloan , had brought in , decanters of some splendid bourbon and Scotch , which the Falklands were too well bred to keep in labeled bottles , but which to Basil 's taste in his first drink seemed like Knob Creek or possibly the top-of-the-line Maker 's Mark . Not the kind you buy in stores , even specialty shops . You had to order it from the company . " Here , darling , " Falkland said , turning to Pamela . " Basil 's and yours . " Pamela carried Basil 's drinkin a fresh glass , he notedto him , reaching out to put it in his hand . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her thumb stroked the back of his hand . Basil 's breath caught . How beautiful she was . He could scarcely believe his luck . Their affair had started the first day of rehearsals . Seeing her husband , and this mansion , knowing that she had been an actress of some considerable reputation , he could imagine that she might be bored in this big house , with a husband who looked fifteen years older . Pamela left her hand next to his just half a second too long . Basil resisted pulling back . Surely that would only make it more obvious . But he thought Falkland had seen . Or maybe not . He 'd been pouring his own drink , rather a stiff one . But he 'd been casually looking toward the sofa , too , over the lip of the glass . Did he notice ? After all , what would he see ? A woman hands a man a drink . Just ordinary hospitality . Just what was expected . Abruptly , Falkland said , " Pamela ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen a dessert wine . I have a lovely Mdoc for dinner . We 're having a crown roast of lamb , and the dinner wine should be just right . But we need something to go with the zabayon and raspberries , do n't we ? " " Yes , I imagine so , dear . " Basil noted that Sloan was waiting near the door that led from this great room to some unspecified back region . Briefly , he wondered why Sloan had n't poured and passed the drinks . " Well , go to the wine cellar with Sloan and find something special , would you ? " " Of course , darling . " An expression of mild puzzlement passed over Pamela 's face , not rising quite to the level of a wrinkle along her lovely brow . " We need something beyond the ordinary for Basil , do n't you think ? Something that sings . A finale ! A last act ! After all , he is an artiste . " " Uh , yes , darling . It 's just that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Basil is your friend . " " Of course . " " Help Mrs. Falkland , please , Sloan , " Falkland said . Pamela went out the door , and Sloan , after nodding to Falkland , followed her . It was just a bit awkward with Pamela gone , Basil found . He rose , strolled about , stopping at the French windows facing the back , admiring the lake view , the private dock , and the yacht anchored there , sleek , long , and bright white even in the dying daylight . He tried a few questions about Falkland 's line of work , but when the man answered at length , he realized that he did n't know what e-arbitrage was and could n't intelligently carry on that line of conversation . Pamela was taking entirely too long with the dessert wine . She should have stayed here to protect him . After all , this damned dinner had been her idea . He wondered whether maybe she was a risk taker and liked to skate close to discovery . He 'd had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Playhouse parking lot at highway speed . Perhaps tonight she was teasing her husband . Well , Basil would have to be doubly careful , if so . Then Falkland quoted , " And bonny Kate , and sometimes Kate the curst ; but , Kate , the prettiest Kate in Christendom ; Kate of Kate-Hall , my super-dainty Kate . ' " " You know the play . " " Oh , yes . I was quite a theater scholar once upon a time . In fact , I met Pamela through the theater . " " Oh ? " " I was a backer for one of her shows . She , of course , was the star . " " But she does n't act outside of rep anymore . " " Oh , I need her all to myself . Thy husband is thy lord , thy life , thy keeper , thy head , thy sovereign ; one that cares for thee ' " " Shakespeare has Kate present some good arguments against that point of view . " " Ah , but Such duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman oweth to her husband . ' " Basil did not respond . How had he gotten drawn into this discussion anyhow ? And where the hell was Pamela ? Sloan appeared in the arch between the great hall and the dining room . Basil was startled for a second to see him , and he realized how very soundproof the back regions were . One heard no sounds of cooking , or plates rattling , or glasses clinking . " Dinner is ready , sir , whenever you are . " Basil had not studied Sloan before , since Basil had been fully occupied with other problems . But now he realized that the man was extremely sleek . His suit was as well made as Falkland 's , or nearly so . His cheeks were pinkly smooth-shaven . His hair , thin on top and combed down flat with no attempt to cover the bald center , was rich brown and shiny . Therefore it was a bit of a surprise that , apparently unknown to Sloan , a small tuft , no bigger than the wing of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushed against something while cooking , if indeed he was the person in the mnage who cooked . Falkland murmured , " What say you to a piece of beef and mustard ? " Basil winced . He was getting bloody damned tired of Shakespeare . " We should wait for Pamela , should n't we ? " " We 'll just start on the appetizer , I think , " Falkland said . Basil sat across from Falkland , himself to the right and Falkland to the left of the head of the long table , a wide pond of shiny walnut between them . Candles were the only lights . The head of the table apparently had been left for Pamela , which made some sense , since it put her between them and she was the only woman present . Or absent , as was the case currently . Basil regarded the silver at his place setting with dismay . Why five forks ? There were also three spoons , but he was sure he could figure those out . One was likely for coffee . Or dessert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director had once told him on a shoot , where they were doing a two-shot of the happy couple at dinner , that a small round soup spoon was for thick soup and a large oval soup spoon was for clear soup . But five forks , only one perhaps identifiable as a salad fork ? Now that he thought about it , the setup was probably designed to intimidate him . Well , he was n't going to let that happen . He said , " Where is Pamela ? We 'll be done with the first course before she arrives if we 're not careful . " " She might bequite a while . Pamela has always had a difficult time making up her mind . " Basil had no idea what to say to that . He sat unhappily in his chair , wondering why Falkland kept the dining room so dark . It would make a wonderful set foroh , hell . The kind of atmosphere Falkland had prepared would only be good for a show with a supernatural element . Or a murder . Gaslight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just the natural dining behavior of the very rich . For the thousandth upon thousandth time Basil reflected that he should have been born rich . Candles at dinner were probably a nightly ritual at the Falklands ' . He 'd used them in his production of An Inspector Calls . And of course Macbeth . Thank God he had n't uttered the name of the Scottish play aloud . Very bad luck . With the darkness crowding his shoulders , and the flicker of the candle flames causing the shadows of his five forks to undulate as if slinking slowly toward his plate , Basil resolved to look upon the whole evening as a set of suggestions for his next noir production . Use it , do n't fight it , he told himself . Sloan entered . He carried two plates of something that surely must not be what it looked like . Surely it was just the low candlelight that made the lumps appear reddish and bloody and undercooked . As the plate touched down in front of Basil with scarcely a sound , he saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Falkland said . " A small portion makes a perfect appetizer . As a main dish it becomes a bit much , do n't you think ? " " Uh , is he serving just us two ? What about Pamela ? " " Oh , Pamela wo n't be long . As I was about to say , as an appetizer I have Sloan serve it without the raw egg . In these troubled times , people are uneasy about eating raw egg . Although if you can buy fresh new eggs from green-run chickens , there is really no danger . And of course with these new methods of preventing salmonella in chickens , something about the properly inoculated feed , you can be quite confident . Nevertheless , for the sake of my guests ' equanimity , I forgo the egg and serve the steak tartare as an appetizer . " Traditionally , of course , it is chopped fillet steak or sirloin , twice run through the grinder . Then mixed with chopped onions and garlic and capers and raw egg . Salt and pepper . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Into that depression is dropped a perfect golden yolk . It is a beautiful presentation , really , the yolk a deep cadmium yellow , and the meat around it rich red . Well , like this , actually . So fresh it glistens . Do you see ? " " Uhhh , yes . " " Of course , " Charles said , steepling his fingers as the manservant stepped back , " it can only be the very , very freshest meat . " " Uh , yes indeed . " " And never , never ground beef from the supermarket . " He uttered the word " supermarket " the way another person might say " latrine . " The man , Basil thought , should have been an actor himself . He certainly got all the juice out of a word . " You 're not eating . Now , these are the traditional accompaniments around itcapers , chopped onion , and minced parsley . " " Mmm-mm . " " Not used to steak tartare , Basil ? " " No . " " Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with caviar . The Swiss even add anchovies . But it seems to me if you 're going for the taste of fresh , raw meat , tarting it up with extraneous flavors is a waste . Do n't you think so ? " " Uhhhh . " " Still , to revert to our earlier topic , I wonder why it had to be The Taming of the Shrew . There are more interesting Shakespeare pieces you could do . " " Uhhh . The trustees , actually . " " The trustees wanted it ? Well , then I suppose you 're stuck with it . They do hold the purse strings . But I wonder , as time goes on , if you could convince them to do Shakespeare 's unappreciated masterpiece . I 'm speaking of Titus Andronicus , of course . " " Mmm . " " It 's reassuring to me , as a Shakespeare enthusiast , that the Julie Taymor film of it is coming out , at least . But there is n't any substitute for the immediacy of the stage . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered . " Real human beings near enough to touch . And Titus Andronicus is so Grand Guignol . It was Shakespeare 's breakout play , you know . Made his name . Although at the time people claimed to be upset at all the violence . " " Media violence " " Fascinating to think that without it , without all that excess , we might never have known the name Shakespeare . " Basil picked up a heavy Francis the First fork . He touched the chopped meat . It was lumpy and bright red , with tiny flecks of gristle or fat . He wondered whether he could tell anything if he touched it with his finger . If it was warm ? Had it been in the refrigerator , or was it body temperature ? But he could n't bear to touch it . Falkland went on . " And what a story . The son of Tamora , Queen of the Goths , has been killed by Titus . For revenge , she has her other two sons rape Titus 's daughter and cut out her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a strangled voice . " Then Titus , in an antic burst of exquisite revenge , invites Tamora to dinner and unknown to her , serves her a pastywe 'd call it a pot pie , I imaginemade from her two sons ' heads . " " I 'm familiar with Titus Andronicus , dammit ! " " Oh , of course you are , dear boy . You 're a director . Terribly sorry . " " Uhhh . " " My word , Basil , you are n't eating . " " Auuhhh " " You have n't touched your steak tartare . " It could not be what he thought . It could not . How long had they been down in that cellar ? And how would Falk land dispose of theof the rest ? But then he recalled the dock , the boathouse . This mansion backed directly onto Lake Michigan . Well , of course it did . It was on the high-rent side of Sheridan . But what about Sloan ? Could Falkland possibly have Sloan so much in his pocket that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at Sloan , standing silent and lugubrious just left of the dining-room door . Falkland caught his glance . " Sloan is such a gem , " he said . " He 's been with me for twenty-three years now . " " Oh , yes ? " " Since I agreed to accept him from the parole board . You see , they would only let him go if he had permanent , residential employment . " " Oh , yes . I see . " " In a home with no children . " Basil stared at his plate . If he so much as sipped a smidgen of water , he would be sick . Staring at his plate was worse . He averted his eyes . But it was too late . Perspiration started up on his forehead and he could feel sweat running into his hair . His face was hot and his abdomen was deeply cold . Basil threw his napkin down next to the army of forks . He half rose . " I do n't think I 'm feeling very well " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this evening . " " I think I 'd better go . " He gagged out the words and could hardly understand what he himself had said . It sounded like " guh-guh-go . " The swinging door from the pantry opened . Pamela stood in the spill of kitchen light , holding a dusty glass bottle . " It 's a terrible clich , I know , " she said smiling apologetically , " but I picked out everything else and finally went back to the Chteau d'Yquem . " " Uh-uh-uh , " Basil said , trying to stand upright , but bent by the pains knifing through his stomach . " Basil ! Are you ill ? " she said . Basil ran at a half crouch out of the dining room , through the long hall and the marble foyer , and pushed out the front door into the glorious cool night air . " Oh , dear , " Pamela said , still smiling . Falkland said , " Fun , darling ? " " Fun . The best we 've ever done . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cup of tea . However , like sushi , if perfect ingredients are chosen , I am told that it is safe . The classic form is ... FOR THE PURIST : 1 pound best sirloin or fillet trimmed of all fat and gristle . Put it twice through a grinder , just before serving . Ground meat is an excellent medium for bacterial growth , so serve it at once . Do not buy ground beef from the store . Mix in : 1 clove of garlic , minced 1/4 cup of chopped onion 1-2 teaspoons salt , depending on taste 1 teaspoon black pepper 1 egg yolk ( you will need 5 eggs in total for a main dish ) 1 tablespoon capers Shape into pattiesfour if you are using this for a main course , eight or more as an appetizer . Generally , for a main course , make four flattish patties with a depression in the middle , and into each drop 1 egg yolk . Serve with parsley and more chopped onion and capers . As an appetizer , shape into balls . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green onions . We are also told now not to eat raw eggs . It is possible to omit the egg yolk , but if you can get green-run chickens raised outdoors , many people believe them to be safe . AND FOR THE FAINT OF HEART : If all this is too much trouble or too scary , here 's another recipe . For deviled meatballs , mix the chopped beef as above . Form into tiny balls and saut in a small amount of olive oil very lightly so as not to break up . Then add about 3/4 cup of your favorite barbecue sauce . You can make it extra dynamite spicy if you like , since people will only have a small mouthful of each . Serve as an appetizer .
