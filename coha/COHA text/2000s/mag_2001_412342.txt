Section : FOREIGN POLICY How conservative foreign policy has been borne out <p> At a time when a popular Republican president is waging a successful war , liberals are having to take their consolations where they can . Some liberals are telling themselves that the renewed esteem for the Pentagon will carry over to support for national health care . Others , bolder , are calling the war a vindication for liberal foreign policy as well as for liberal domestic policy . Al Hunt wrote , " Today 's basic policy **27;1425;TOOLONG , a strong reliance on the United Nations , and multilateralism-all were articulated during the 2000 campaign by the Democratic candidate . " George Mitchell , the former Senate majority leader , says that President Bush has succeeded " in part because he has simply discarded almost everything he said on foreign policy prior to September 11 . " <p> It is tempting to respond to this line of argument by asking why , if Clinton-Gore-style liberal internationalism is so great , eight years of it did nothing to prevent the September 11 attacks . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign affairs contributed to American vulnerability , the temptation should not be resisted . Indeed , the war so far has been a vindication of Bush 's foreign-policy inclinations as against those of his critics , both liberal and neoconservative . <p> Consider the hallmarks of modern liberal internationalism : the delusion that the military and geopolitical issues that had occupied statesmen in previous eras could now give way to questions of international environmental policy , the promotion of commerce , and " soft power " ; the conviction that any conflicts between peoples are more apparent than real , and amenable to solution through better communication and the building of trust ( are there any peoples who understand each other better than Northern Ireland 's Catholics and Protestants , or know each other 's ambitions better than the Palestinians and Israelis ? ) ; the obsession with multilateralism and the dream of " global governance " ; the fondness for humanitarian interventions related loosely , if at all , to national interests ; the exal tation of international treaties in which dictators make paper promises to improve their behavior ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a message " rather than to defeat enemies . <p> In the post-9/11 context , all of this seems as chimerical as the Kellogg-Briand pact to outlaw war did after the invasion of Poland . Bill Clinton 's endless proffering of apologies for America 's sins , real and imagined , looks even worse . <p> Is the above a caricature of Clintonian foreign policy ? Not to judge from the former president 's own November speech on the terrorist attacks . Clinton was widely criticized for dwelling on the historical misdeeds of the ancestors of white Christians . Less widely remarked is that his proposed course of action for America mainly emphasized rhetoric , cultural exchange , and confidence-building measures . Even now , he appears incapable of imagining a problem that he ca n't talk his way out of . <p> Sen. Mitchell 's claim , however , is based on caricature . Bush did not have to abandon the " unilateralism " the liberals decry because he never took it up in the first place . To eschew allies would be silly as well as dangerous , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major foreign-policy speech during the presidential campaign , at the Reagan Library in November 1999 , repeatedly mentioned the importance of " strengthening the alliances that sustain our influence in Europe and East Asia and the Middle East . " He even noted that " international organizations can serve the cause of peace . " <p> It is a characteristic ( and annoying ) conceit of liberal internationalism that no other type of internationalism exists . Thus liberals have a hard time grasping that a conservative internationalist such as Bush can value alliances and organizations-but as instruments , not ends in themselves . To consult with allies is not to run a focus group . In the present crisis , America has led and asked others to follow ; it has not waited for an international consensus to form before taking action . ( Does anyone imagine we would be close to victory in Afghanistan , or even have begun to fight , had we waited for a U.N . go-ahead ? ) Moreover , Americans , with the Northern Alliance , have done almost all the fighting . <p> Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any wispy notion of international community . Britain and Australia are with us because of a cultural affinity that underlies an ideological one . Our local allies are motivated by a combination of fear of our wrath , fear of our enemies ' success , greed for our money , and a craven desire to back the winner . The president has not needed to give an inch on the global-warming accord , the International Criminal Court , or missile defense to win their support . <p> Our willingness to work with unsavory allies is , indeed , another rebuke to liberal idealism in foreign policy . To be sure , the Clinton administration had nasty allies , as all administrations must . But we largely preferred to turn a blind eye to their faults , pretending for example that the Kosovo Liberation Army was not a band of drug-running thugs . Nobody has any illusions about the Northern Alliance or the Pakistani military regime-or about the necessity of using them . <p> By bringing us back to our bedrock interest in survival , the war has seen a general return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to surrounding himself with realist advisers , has become more realist during the war . In his Reagan Library speech , he said that " we can not excuse Russian brutality " in Chechnya . It turns out that we can ignore it . <p> Liberal relativism , equivocation , and guilt have been early casualties of the war . But liberals are not the only foreign-policy thinkers who have engaged in a flight from realism and , sometimes , from reality . " Idealism " comes in neoconservative as well as liberal flavors . The debate between realists and idealists in foreign policy always has a somewhat artificial quality because both camps concede so much to the other . Idealists know that America can not pursue its values without regard to its interests and capabilities . Realists understand that the spread of freedom serves our interests-as President Bush proclaimed in that same speech . It is no wonder , then , that both labels have a tendency to become less descriptions of schools of thought than idle boasts . <p> The war has also scrambled the arguments between these schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war so far , the anti-realist neoconservatives who are usually friendly to the idea of " nation-building " were warning the administration not to engage in it in Afghanistan , while the realist conservatives who generally disdain the idea were suggesting it for Iraq . This moment of confusion exposed a theoretical weakness in both positions . Realists have sometimes discounted the importance of the internal structure of regimes-treating Soviet foreign-policy behavior as a function of traditional Russian nationalism , for example , rather than of the inherently aggressive character of totalitarianism . But this is a failure of realism to be sufficiently realistic . Dismantling totalitariani sm in Iraq and replacing it with the institutions of freedom is a condition of peace , and a realism that recognizes this fact is an improved realism . <p> The neoconservatives , for their part , were merely making the commonsense point that the war in Afghanistan would have to be won before it made sense to form a new government there . They may very well revert to form by favoring a continued American presence to run a postwar Afghanistan ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " peacekeeping . " If so , the administration is unlikely to satisfy them . It seems currently inclined to leave Afghanistan to our allies . This policy would be in keeping with the president 's distinction between warmaking and peacekeeping , and with conservative realist John Hillen 's comment that " superpowers do n't do windows . " <p> That policy may also be necessary if the administration is to turn against Iraq , a goal of both the realists and the neoconservatives . But to say this is to say that there is a limit to how much American power can accomplish , at least at any one time . For several years , some neoconservatives have talked as though the overthrow of the Chinese regime could be the focus of American foreign policy . The war should end this fantasy , even for those who ( like me ) detest the Chinese regime , consider its interests largely opposed to ours , and would welcome its replacement by a liberal democracy . Much of the art of statecraft is discrimination , which is why neoconservative idealism is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy . <p> The neoconservatives have tended to regard prudence as a virtue of the weak , just as liberals have faulted it for want of imagination . But the war also reminds us that prudence , though much mocked and uninspiring , is not to be confused with timidity and is in fact the cardinal virtue in foreign policy . As the late realist John P. Roche remarked , the world is not made of Play-Doh . <p> By Ramesh Ponnuru <p>
