Section : In Review FILM <p> ERIC TILL 'S Luther : Rebel , Liberator , Genius portrays the Reformer in warm and glowing technicolor . One can not but side with this courageous young man who takes on an insensitive and secularized religious establishment . Heroes and villains are made easily identifiable in this film , though historical authenticity gets short shrift in the process . <p> The film concentrates on the crucial half-decade of Luther 's life between 1517 , when his 95 theses triggered the controversy with the Roman Catholic Church , and 1521 , when he refused to recant his convictions before the assembly of the German Estates at Worms and was declared an outlaw . A brief prelude takes us back ten years , when Luther decided to become a monk , while the final portion of the film includes scenes showing the iconoclasm of some Lutheran sympathizers ; the uprisings of the German peasants ; Katherina von Bora , whom Luther married in 1525 ; and finally the Diet at Augsburg in 1530 , when the emperor attempted to suppress the Lutheran innovators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German peasants make their appearance for reasons of political correctness . <p> The film does not show convincingly why and how " rebel , liberator and genius " came together in Luther . The German peasants assuredly did not take him to be their liberator . Luther steers clear of major issues surrounding the Reformer . Was the church really that depraved in the early 16th century or is this Protestant propaganda ? Is Luther 's story , and that of his supporters , solely a religious story or was there a convergence of power politics , economics , misunderstandings and religion ? The film avoids placing Luther into this matrix , contenting itself with time-honored Protestant clichs , such as that the Catholic Church was badly in need of a rebel ( the film is rather melodramatic and graphic when it purports to show what Rome was like ca. 1510 ) . And John Tetzel ism aligned once more with the allegation , a favorite ' Protestant chestnut , that he claimed indulgences would spare even someone . who had violated the Virgin Mary . <p> To cite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frederick the Wise , never met ; Pope Leo X died well before 1525 ; Luther did not nail the 95 theses on the door of the Wittenberg castle church but sent them to Archbishop Albert ; Frederick did not pay Luther 's salary ; worshipers did not sit in pews in the early 16th century ; Luther did not come to Wittenberg as a parish priest ; Carlstadt never advocated political egalitarianism ; Luther returned to a tumultuous Wittenberg not at Elector Frederick 's behest but very much ( and quite courageously so ) against the ruler 's will . One wishes also to have been spared such modernizing anachronisms as Luther 's saying , " Thanks for coming to mass " as worshipers leave church , and " We will play joyous music together " to Katie . <p> From the first time Pope Leo X appears on the screen ( in conjunction with Luther 's hardly well-explained trip to Rome ) , it is clear who the bad guy is . The scenes showing Leo serve no other purpose than to denote his worldliness . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the traditional Protestant perspective were correct , we would be at a loss to explain why so many Catholics remained faithful to their church . <p> The segment depicting the German peasant uprising , and Luther 's involvement in it , fails to explain either and uses a couple of sentences to paper over Luther 's notorious recommendation to the rulers to " stab , slay , kill the peasants like wild dogs . " A subplot , in which Luther insists on a church burial for a boy who had committed suicide ( undoubtedly intended to portray the " human " side of Luther ) , stretches theological possibilities even for the " rebel " Luther . Nor was the Diet of Augsburg in 1530 , with which the film ends , a victory for the reform movement . Luther was n't even in the picture . Philip Melanchthon presented the confession of faith based on Wittenberg theology , the Augsburg Confession , because the emperor had asked for it , but at the adjournment of the diet , the emperor gave the supporters of Luther half a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dramatic climax to end the film . <p> Most moviegoers will care little about such details , and in a way , they are quite right . These are matters for scholars , and even they do not always agree . Much of Elizabeth was historically incorrect , but it offered an integrated portrait of the English queen . The failure of Luther lies precisely at that level : it fails to portray the inner dynamic of Luther and do that consistently from beginning to end . Luther is disjointed because it attempts to cover too much , and it also fails to reduce the complexity of ideas and events to an intelligible level . <p> The script by Camille Thomasson and Bart Gavigan valiantly endeavors to convey Luther 's spiritual struggle in the monastery , but how that struggle related to the subsequent controversy over indulgences , and how the critique of indulgences provoked the support of people and rulers , remains unclear . Luther 's pivotal theological affirmation is reduced to the notion that God loves us ( contrary to the supposedly Catholic notion that God is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gospel as Luther understood it . <p> The authentic Luther does come through in a number of ways . His own words are heard extensively from the screen , with all their power and directness , and his translation of the New Testament into German is highlighted . Other positives include the camera work of Robert Fraisse , who provides a rich , fairy-tale splendor  --  a feast for the eyes . Since most of the film focuses on the younger Luther , Joseph Fiennes 's frail , almost haggard stature is not inappropriate . But by the end of the film , in 1530 , Luther was 47 years old , a reality not visible in the closing scenes , in which Fiennes 's Luther has not aged one bit from the time he entered the monastery . <p> Unfortunately Fiennes overplays Luther 's spiritual struggles and uncertainties , and he is thereby forced to underplay the dynamic and self-confident person Luther became . It is never clear with Fiennes 's Luther if he is driven by events or is driving them . He reminds us of Willem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is uncertain of his vocation , uncertain what to make of the " voices " ' he hears . <p> Peter Ustinov ( Fredrick the Wise ) steals the show with the confidence of the seasoned actor . Claire Cox ( as Katie Luther ) exudes the pent-up libido of years in the convent and comes across as a sexual tease who lures an unsuspecting Luther into matrimony . Bruno Ganz is sympathetic as Johann von Staupitz , who sought to combine loyalty to the pope and the church with a paternal understanding of Luther . Richard Harvey 's score is for long stretches ethereal . One wonders why Luther 's hymns  --  surely one of his major achievements-were not incorporated more into Harvey 's score . <p> Nevertheless , a film in which the words " Jesus , " " sin , " " forgiveness , " " grace , " " salvation " are uttered unabashedly , and which explicates the Christian notion of salvation , is rare indeed these days , especially a film playing in commercial theaters . At a time when filmmakers shy away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or The Magdalene Sisters  --  to show the negatives , Luther is welcome . Despite its disposition to portray a " reel " Luther , Luther does tell us that the Reformer 's life and faith were exciting and meaningful , and have bearing on Christian existence today . <p> Reviewed by Hans Hillerbrand <p> <p> Hans Hillerbrand , who teaches history at Duke University . <p>
