Armageddon 's Children By Terry Brooks Random House Terry Brooks One He is fast asleep in his bed on the night that the demon and the once-men come for his family . They have been watching the compound for days , studying its walls and the routine of the guards who ward them . They have waited patiently for their chance , and now it has arrived . An advance party is over the walls and past the guards . They have opened the gates from the inside to let in the others , and now all are pouring into the compound . In less than five minutes , everything has been lost . He does n't realize this when his father shakes him awake , but he knows something is wrong . " Logan , get up . " Urgency and fear are apparent in his father 's voice . Logan blinks against the beam of the flashlight his father holds , one of two they still possess . He sees his brother dressing across the way , pulling on his shirt and pants , moving quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying anything , does n't even look over at him . His father bends close , his strong features all planes and angles at the edges of the flashlight 's beam . His big hand grips his son 's shoulder and squeezes . " It 's time for us to leave here , Logan . Put on your clothes and your pack and wait by the trapdoor with Tyler . Your mother and I will be along with Megan . " His sister . He looks around , but does n't see her . Outside , there isshouting and the sound of gunfire . A battle is being fought . He knows now what has happened , even without seeing it . He has heard it talked about all of his life , the day their enemies would find a way to break through , the day that the walls and gates and guards and defenses would finally give way . It has happened all across the United States . It has happened all over the world . No one is safe anywhere . Maybe no one will ever be safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother already has his pack strapped across his back and tosses Logan his . The packs have been sitting in a corner of his bedroom for as far back as he can remember . Each month , they are unpacked , checked , and repacked . His father is a careful man , a planner , a survivor . He has always assumed this day would come , even though he assured his family it would not . Logan was not fooled . His father did not speak of it directly , but in the spaces between the words of reassurance were silent warnings . Logan did not miss them , did not ignore their implications . " Hurry , slug , " Tyler hisses at him , going out the door . He finishes fastening his boots , throws his pack over his shoulder , and hurries after his brother . The shouts are growing louder now , more frantic . There are screams , as well . He feels curiously removed from all of it , as if it were happening to people with whom he had no connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He feels light-headed , and there is a buzzing in his ears . Maybe he has gotten up too fast , has rushed himself the way he does sometimes without allowing his body to adjust to a sudden change . Maybe it is just the first of many adjustments he is going to have to make in his life . He knows what is going to happen now . His father has told them all , taking care to use the word if rather than the word when . They are going to have to escape through the tunnels and flee into the surrounding countryside . They are going to have to abandon their home and all their possessions because otherwise they will be caught and killed . The demons and the once-men have made it clear from the beginning that those who choose to shut themselves away in the compounds will not be spared once their defenses are breached . It is punishment for defiance , but it is a warning , too . If you want to survive , you have to place yourself in our hands . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can survive outside the compounds . Not as a free man or woman . Not with the plagues and poisons in the air , water , and soil . Not with the slave camps to take you in and swallow you up . Not with the Freaks and the monsters running amok in cities and towns and villages everywhere . Not with the demons and once-men seeking to exterminate the human race . Not in this brave new world . Logan knows this even though he is only eight years old . He knows it because he is dreaming it , reliving it twenty years later . His understanding of its truths transcends time and place ; he embraces the knowledge in the form of memories . He knows it the way he already knows how things will end . He is standing with Tyler in front of the trapdoor when his father reaches them , ushering his mother and sister into place . " Stay together , " he tells them , glancing from face to face . " Look out for each other . " He carries a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when fired can tear a hole through a stone wall a foot thick . Logan has seen it fired only once , years ago , when his father was testing it . The sound of its discharge was deafening . There was a burning smell in his nose and a ringing in his ears afterward . The memory stays with him to this day . He is afraid of the weapon . If his father carries it , things are as bad as they can possibly be . " Jack . " His mother speaks his father 's name softly , and she turns and takes him in her arms , burying her face in his shoulder . The shouts and screams and firing are right outside their door . His father lets her hold him for a moment , then eases her away , reaches down , and flings back the trapdoor . " Go ! " he snaps , motioning them in . Tyler does n't hesitate ; carrying the second of the two flashlights , he goes down through the opening . Megan follows him , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " his father calls when he sees his youngest hesitate . In the next instant the front door blows apart in a fiery explosion that engulfs both his mother and his father and sends him tumbling head-over-heels down the stairway to land in a twisted heap on top of his sister . She screams , and something heavy falls on the dirt floor next to him , barely missing his head . In the waver of Tyler 's flashlight he looks down and sees the Tyson Flechette . He stares at it until his brother jerks him to his feet and snatches up the weapon himself . Their eyes meet and they both know . " Run ! " Tyler grunts . Together the three children hurry down the long dark corridor , following the beam of the flashlight . In the darkness ahead , other flashlight beams and flickering candles appear out of other tunnels that join this one , and the sound of voices grows louder . He knows they all come from homes close to his own . The tunnel was the joint project of many families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a bolt-hole in case of the unspeakable . Quickly the tunnels are packed , and people are pushing and shoving . Tyler , fighting to keep Megan in tow with one hand while wielding his flashlight with the other , shouts his name and shoves the Tyson Flechette at him . Logan takes it without thinking . His hands close over the cool , smooth metal of the barrel and work down to the leather-bound grip . Curiously , the weapon feels right in his hands ; it feels like it belongs there . His fear of it dissipates as he cradles it to his chest . Ahead , there is a convergence of lights , and a wooden stairway leads upward . People are pouring out of the tunnel and up the steps into a night filled with flashes and explosions and the sounds of death and dying . He can feel the heat of an intense fire as he gains the opening . As he breathes in the night air , he can smell the acrid stench of smoke and charred timbers . He has just paused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Megan , when an explosion rips the earth beneath him , flinging him backward into the night . An eerie silence descends over his immediate surroundings . Everything he hears now is distant and strangely muffled . He can not see at first , can not even move , lying on the ground clutching the flechette as if it were a lifeline . He rises with difficulty , dazed and in shock . He sees bodies strewn everywhere on the ground in front of him , all around the tunnel opening , dozens and dozens of crumpled forms . He climbs to his feet and staggers over to where Tyler and Megan lie still and bleeding , their eyes wide and staring . He feels his chest tighten and his strength drain away . They are gone . His whole family is gone . It happened so fast . Sudden movement catches his eye as a knot of dark forms converges on him from out of the darkness . Once-men , wild-eyed and feral , their faces the faces of animals . Without thinking , without even knowing how he remembers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tyson Flechette , whips up the barrel , and fires into their midst . Dozens of them disappear , blown backward into the night . He swings the barrel to the right and fires again . Dozens more fly apart . He is exhilarated , become as maddened as they are , as consumed by bloodlust . He hates them for what they have done . He wants to destroy them all . Then he sees another figure , an old man standing off to one side , tall and stooped and ghost-gray in a cloak that hangs almost to the ground . His eyes are fixed on Logan , peering out from beneath a slouch-brimmed hat , and in those eyes is a cold approval that terrifies the boy . He does not understand what it is the old man approves of , but he does understand one thing . Without ever having come face-to-face with one before , he knows instinctively that this is a demon . The demon smiles at him and nods . A hand jerks him about sharply and whips the flechette out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a face streaked with grease and sweat . " Good enough , boy , but it 's time to leave now . Let 's live to fight another day ! " He takes Logan 's arm and begins to run with him into the darkness . Others with faces painted in the same way join with him , shepherding the strays they have gathered from the ruins of the compound . A rear guard forms up to protect their retreat , weapons firing into the waves of once-men that seek to reach them . " Run , boy . " The man who holds him shoves him away . Fighting down the pain he feels in his gut , struggling to hold back his tears , he does . He does not look back . the midmorning sunlight blinded Logan Tom when he opened his eyes , and he blinked hard to clear away the sleep as he peered out through the windshield of the Lightning S-150 AV . The Indiana countryside , empty of life , spread away to either side of the little copse of elms he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had followed west toward Chicago stretched back the way he had come and ahead the way he must go , cracked and weed-grown and littered with debris . His gaze shifted . Fields fallow and dried out from weeks without rain formed a broken brown patchwork to the south . North , about half a mile off , a farmhouse and barn sat abandoned and derelict in a small grove of oaks turned wintry and leached of life . On the four horizons , nothing moved . Not even feeders , and feeders were everywhere there were humans to consume . He reached over for the staff , gripped it tightly for a moment , then ran his hands slowly along its polished black length , feeling the reassuring presence of the runes carved into its surface . Another day in the world . He checked the gauges of the AV , a cursory examination of several banks of lights that glimmered a uniform green in the daylight brightness . The red lights were dark , reassuring him that nothing had approached the vehicle during the night . He would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it did n't hurt to make sure . The assault vehicle was his favorite weapon against the things that hunted him , and he relied on her the way you relied on a best friend . Not that he had ever had a best friend . Michael had been his last real friend , but mostly he had been Logan 's teacher . It was Michael , a genius with anything mechanical , who had acquired and modified the AV . When he was gone , the Lightning had become Logan 's , a small legacy from a man larger than life . He thought momentarily of his dream , of that last night with his family , with his childhood . Twenty years ago now , but it seemed an eternity . Do n't dwell on it . Do n't give power of any kind to the past . Satisfied that nothing threatened , he glanced at the solar battery readings . Full power . He was good to go . Solar had its advantages in a world in which the climates had been so drastically altered that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equator to Canada . When you crossed the Mississippi , there was nothing but desert until you reached the mountains , then more of the same after that until you got close to the coast . The ozone layer had mostly burned away , the polar ice caps all but vanished . Temperatures had risen everywhere , and the land that had once been Middle America had turned stunted and dry . Old news ; it had happened more than thirty years ago . So lots of sunshine was the forecast for today , tomorrow , and the next few centuries . Rainfall ? Six to eight inches a year in the wet spots . Logan Tom wondered if anyone would ever again see anything that even resembled the old world . He thought it possible his descendants might , one extrapolated from the raw conditions of the present . But the world his parents and grandparents had known was gone forever , as dead as the moral and social fabric that had failed to hold it together . No one had thought it possible . No one had believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Word , who had dreamed the nightmare and tried unsuccessfully to prevent it . Men and women conscripted to the cause , champions of and believers in the need to keep the magic that bound all things in balance . For there was magic in the world , born out of the time before humankind , out of the world of Faerie , out of an older civilization . Magic that infused and sustained , that reached beyond what could be seen or even understood to tie together in symbiotic fashion all life . Magic over which both the Word and the Void sought to exercise control . It was an old struggle , one that dated all the way back to the birth of humanity . It was a struggle for supremacy between shadings of light and dark , between gradations of good and evil . Logan Tom did n't pretend to understand all the nuances . Continues ...
