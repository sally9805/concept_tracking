Gilly Kincade stood en pointe to see over the dancers hovering around Meredith Bernard , crumpled in a heap of white tulle in the backstage shadows . Gilly caught a glimpse of stage manager Paul Arther , kneeling with the principal dancer 's purpling ankle in his hands . <p> " Shut up , Meredith , you 're not going back on stage . " Paul looked over his shoulder . " Gilly , change your costume . I 'll hold the curtain five minutes , but you 've got to hurry . " <p> Meredith moaned . " No ! My ankle 's fine . Look ! " She struggled to her feet , whimpering as her left heel came in contact with the floor . Her narrow , strong-boned face was ashen , and she blinked away tears . <p> Gilly wanted to cry with her . Forced off the stage in the middle of a ballet - and in Saratoga Springs ... " Paul , are you sure ? " <p> Paul 's eyes frosted . " If you do n't want the role , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I - Of course I want it . " She 'd understudied Odette 's variations and knew them cold . <p> Please , God , help me not to faint . <p> " Good . " Paul slid a pair of scissors under the satin ribbons wrapped around Meredith 's ankle and snipped through them , grounding the swan maiden for the foreseeable future . " You 'll need to put ice on that ankle , Mer . We 'll have somebody drive you to the ER to get it X-rayed . " <p> Meredith began to sob that it was Dmitri 's fault that she came down wrong , and he should be fired . Or shot . <p> Gilly could n't look at her . Did n't have time anyway . Somebody would have to take her own place in the corps de ballet - probably an apprentice waiting in the wings . But that was n't her problem . She tore into the dressing room . " Frankie ! I need the other Odette costume ! " <p> Frankie Silverman looked up from tacking Jarrica Black 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes ! Curtain goes up in five minutes ! " <p> " Gadzooks ! " The costume manager leapt to her feet , leaving needle and thread dangling against the back of Jarrica 's thigh . " Stay put , " she ordered the young corps dancer . <p> Jarrica put her hands on her hips but obeyed . <p> Gilly stripped off her corps costume and let Frankie help her with the Odette tutu and headpiece , then charged out of the dressing room to stumble through dark backstage territory . With fifteen seconds to spare she made it to her mark . The curtain opened ... <p> She became Odette , transformed by the evil von Rothbart into a swan , doomed to eternally float on Swan Lake . She lost herself in the movement , the longing for humanity , the longing for her prince 's love ... All dance was either elation or longing , rarely anything in between . She knew there had to be some spiritual implication , but for now she was simply a storyteller . Beautiful that she and Tchaikovsky , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princess . <p> She danced Act Two in a blur , high on the pure adrenaline of the spotlight . Beyond it breathed the audience , a black wall of energy . The corps surrounded her , white tutus forming beautiful lines of motion like lily pads floating on the lake of the stage . <p> Dmitri Lanskov danced toward her , smiling . " Up you go , " he murmured . <p> She leapt as Dmitri lifted her high , throwing both arms above her head , exploding with joy . He spun with her over his shoulder , carried her across the stage , carefully set her on her toes . She bourrTed , floating away from Dmitri , drifting into a series of ecstatic arabesques . Then she bourrTed toward him again . With her arm lightly curled around his head , they melted into a simple , elegant bow . <p> The audience came to its feet , roaring applause . Gilly could hardly breathe . She felt God 's smile . <p> * * * <p> Jacob Ferrar rose with the audience under the soaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands together until they hurt . He had just been privileged to watch a star burst into place . If he 'd had a flower , he would have thrown it onto the stage , but who expected to be confronted with genius in a substitute corps dancer ? It was like finding an orchid in a field of clover . <p> Suddenly he was glad he 'd made the long , frustrating trip to attend Ballet New York 's final performance in their summer home . He almost forgot to worry about Graham , left with his indulgent grandparents . He almost forgot the effects of insomnia that had dogged him for the last two months . He almost forgot the last time he 'd danced on this blazing stage . <p> After all , Saratoga Springs on a mild summer night was a magical place , even from the audience . Above the canopy of the stage the open sky shimmered with moonlight and far-flung stars , and from his orchestra-level seat he was close enough to see the red-haired dancer 's face flushed with triumph , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doll . He could almost feel the throb of her pulse with the deep rise and fall of her bosom . He could see the sweat dripping off her dainty , pointed chin . <p> That made him smile . He glanced at Wendy Kersey , his company 's ballet mistress , who had traveled with him from Birmingham to choose guest dancers for their Nutcracker . Even as she enthusiastically applauded , Wendy was watching Jacob rather than the pair onstage folded into a graceful double bow . <p> " What ? " He returned his attention to the dancers . <p> " You 've changed your mind , have n't you ? " There was humor in Wendy 's voice . <p> He did n't answer for a moment , continued to applaud and cheer until the curtain closed for a final time . Finally he looked at Wendy . " Maybe . What do you think ? " <p> " I think this is your company and you should do what you want . " <p> Jacob laughed . " You 've been ballet mistress for three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> Wendy gathered her black lace shawl around her bony shoulders and edged into the aisle . " Because you came here intending to offer a contract to Meredith Bernard , and now you 're considering this ingTnue who has n't even made soloist yet . " <p> Jacob picked up his program and followed Wendy toward the theater exit . She was perhaps fifteen years his senior - though her age was a closely guarded state secret and no one knew for sure - but she liked to play a game of deferring to him . <p> Amused , he caught up to her . " Clearly you do n't think that 's a good idea . " <p> Wendy stopped in the grassy park outside the covered seating . Subdued laughter and conversation floated around them as the departing audience eddied past . She sighed . " Jacob , your instincts are as good as any director I 've worked with to date . Perhaps better . If you think this girl is ready to handle the Sugar Plum role , then by all means , bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet to dance it in New York . " <p> " That 's true . " Jacob shrugged . " Which I do n't understand . Poiroux is generally quick to move young dancers into responsible roles almost before they 're ready . " He shook his head . " But you saw her . Thirty-two fouettTs perfectly nailed ! I could n't take my eyes off - And she 's from Alabama . If we play that up , she 'll be a real draw . " <p> " It would be a gamble . " Wendy made a wry face . " But at least she 'll cost less than the Bernard girl . " She lifted her shoulders . " Go for it , then . " <p> " There are reviewers here . The dance bloggers will be talking about her tomorrow . " <p> " Yes , which will drive up the price . Do you have a favor you could call in ? " <p> " Not exactly . But I do know Maurice Poiroux . " Jacob could swallow his pride for this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at the cast party tonight . " <p> Wendy studied him . " It 's been five years , Jacob . " <p> " But he wo n't have forgotten . " He looked away . " I would n't have forgotten . " <p> Her propriety was such that she rarely touched him unless they were demonstrating a dance , but she gently laid her fingers on his wrist . " It 's time to forgive yourself , my friend . " <p> " I know . Yes , I know . " He smiled , though some of the joy had gone out of the evening , and pulled her hand through the crook of his elbow . They began to thread their way through the crowd . " Let 's see if we can find the car in this madhouse . What do you think about Lanskov as her partner ? " <p> * * * <p> Gilly dropped her dance bag on the floor inside the bedroom she had called home for the last three weeks and walked over to the antique dresser . For forty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the furnishings in this Victorian behemoth belonged to some rich upstate New Yorker involved with the horseracing industry , but she and four other dancers had been renting it during the month of July for the ballet season . <p> She flattened her hands on top of the white crocheted runner and leaned in to stare at her face in the mirror . Before leaving the theater she 'd removed the mask of heavy makeup . Now , clearly visible were the sprinkle of freckles she 'd covered up since she was twelve years old , the tiny diamond stud in her nose that nobody could talk her out of , the quirky red eyebrows that bent slightly upward at the tips . <p> But she was different now . <p> " Soloist , " she whispered . " You . Gillian Frances Kincade . Soloist for Ballet New York . " <p> She grinned and ran to grab her phone . Flinging herself backward on the bed , she pressed the first speed-dial number . It was hard to choose which of her sisters to call first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two personalities . It was midnight here , but only eleven o'clock in Montgomery , Alabama . The McGaughans were night owls . They 'd have put the girls to bed and stayed up to watch a late-night talk show or a movie . <p> Laurel answered on the first ring , her drawl distinct and sleepy . " Gilly ! Honey , are you all right ? " <p> Gilly laughed . " I 'm very all right . " <p> " Oh , good . " There was a relieved sigh . " So how did the ballet go tonight ? It was the last one , right ? " <p> " Yes . " Gilly paused . " Laurel , are you sitting down ? " <p> " I 'm ... well , Cole and I were - " <p> Gilly laughed . " No details , please . I just had to tell you - drum roll - " She took a giddy breath . " Maurice moved me up to soloist tonight . He announced it during the cast party . " <p> Alabama Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilly , that 's wonderful ! Cole - Gilly made soloist . " <p> Gilly could hear her brother-in-law lean in to share the phone . " Congratulations , squirt . You deserve it . " <p> " Thanks . " She could feel her smile taking over her face again . " This is almost as cool as the day they invited me to join the company . " <p> " I can imagine . " Laurel had the phone back . " So give me the details . How did it happen ? What did everybody say ? " <p> " Um , well , everybody was excited for me except Meredith Bernard . She 's kind of in the hospital with her ankle in pins - which is why I got a shot at Odette tonight . " <p> " Wow . Poor girl . " Laurel understood the critical nature of a dancer 's body . She 'd seen Gilly alternately pamper , discipline , and abuse hers for the last sixteen years . " But good for you . You must 've brought down the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laurel , I 've always wanted to dance Odette in Swan Lake . Almost as much as Sugar Plum Fairy in Nutcracker . " " Well , maybe that 'll be next . " <p> " Maybe . Maurice is kind of ... unpredictable about casting . " <p> " That 's what I hear . Now that you 're a soloist , will he have any objection to you dancing in our arts festival in October ? The entertainment committee is so excited about you coming . " <p> " No , there wo n't be a problem . We did a formal contract , after all . I talked to Tucker and he 's all set to do the music . I got my plane ticket rerouted yesterday . The rest of the company will leave Athens and go straight back to New York . I 'm flying into Birmingham instead of Montgomery , though . Can you or Cole come pick me up ? " <p> " Of course . " Laurel laughed softly . " Mom 's a little miffed that you 're planning to stay here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she 'll get over it . She and Daddy and Mary Layne 's bunch are all coming up for the festival . " <p> " Yay ! My whole million-member family all in one place ! I ca n't wait . " Gilly stood up to unzip the dress she 'd worn to the cast party and shrugged it off . It fell to the floor , and she kicked it aside . " Well , I need a shower before I hit the sack . Do n't tell Mary Layne until I can call her tomorrow , okay ? " <p> " All right , baby , have a good rest . I bet you 're worn out . " <p> " Pretty much . " Gilly padded barefoot to the tiny bathroom off the bedroom . Her energy , fueled by adrenaline , seemed to seep away with each step . " Tell Cole good night for me . " <p> " Okay . Good night , little sister . I 'm proud of you . " <p> " ' Night , Lolly . " <p> Gilly laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for toothbrush and toothpaste , face cleanser , and moisturizer . Tomorrow she 'd have to pack it all up and take the train back to the City with the rest of the company . Her little Tribeca apartment had stood empty for three weeks , and it would take a bit of effort to put her things back in order . <p> By the time she got that done , it would be time to pack again for the company 's Mediterranean tour . Maybe she should make a list before she went to bed . <p> As she squirted Ultra-Brite on her purple Elmo toothbrush , she caught a glimpse of her feet . Several blisters had popped and looked kind of red and weepy . She grimaced . Feet took precedence over lists , and she was n't going to be awake much longer . <p> Being the baby of the family , she was n't a natural organizer , but she 'd had to learn to do more for herself since her mother moved back to Mobile three years ago and left her on her own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this chance at chasing a dream . <p> And now , finally , it was paying off . Soloist . <p> Scrubbing her back teeth , mouth full of foam , she yawned . She spit and laughed at herself in the mirror . Even swan princesses had to sleep sometime . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
