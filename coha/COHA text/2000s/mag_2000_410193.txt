( IN 8 WEEKS ) A four-day-a-week cardio workout to get you ready for a fit and fantastic summer // WELCOME TO YOUR AEROBIC COUNTDOWN TO SUMMER ! To go with your strength and stretch program on page 116 , this plan , created by Kevin Lewis , owner of State of the Art Fitness in Woodland Hills , Calif. , incorporates two types of aerobic training , interval and steady-state endurance , for maximum results with no chance of boredom . And it 's got one more bonus : You 'll train indoors two days a week and outdoors the other two . More important is the science behind the workout . It 's based on monitoring your heart rate while exercising at different intensities . " Doing cardio exercise without monitoring your heart rate is like strength training without knowing how much weight you 're lifting or how many reps you 're doing , " Lewis says . You can learn how to measure your maximum heart rate by turning to page 125 . Meanwhile , here 's why this program , which incorporates outdoor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumping - and the calories burning - for the next eight weeks . " The temperature changes , wind resistance and uneven terrain of the outdoors naturally increase your workload in ways indoor training does n't " says Lewis . " Indoor training is important , though , because you can control the elements and , therefore , the parameters of your workout . " Lewis suggests you choose indoor cardio exercises that will complement your outdoor activity , such as a Spinning class or recumbent bike , if you plan to cycle , or a treadmill , if you like to walk around your neighborhood . Whatever your chosen activity , you 'll do two types of workouts : steady-state endurance and interval training . " Endurance training allows you to do any activity for longer , " says Lewis . " in contrast , interval training , which alternates moderate aerobic activity with intense activity , strengthens your heart and burns lots of calories , so you lose more fat . Put the two routines together and not only will your heart be in great shape , but so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've got all the bases covered in our eight-week program : weight training , flexibility and cardio . It 's a sure-fire way to start the summer with a strong , fit and flexible bod . BEGINNER : You 've been exercising aerobically for less than 3 months . Do 2-4 weeks of the endurance program before you incorporate the intervals . Photograph Hot Fun : bikini by Luce di Sole .

Do 2-4 weeks of the endurance program before you incorporate the intervals . INTERMEDIATE . You 've been exercising aerobically at least 3 times a week for 3 months or more . ADVANCED : You 've been training aerobically 4-5 times per week for at least 6 months . For all of the workouts , warm up for 5 minutes with low-intensity cardio activity and cool down for the same amount of time . Choose an intensity that allows you to maintain a steady heart rate for the duration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your indoor bike that keeps your heart beating as fast as it does when you pedal at an equivalent speed on an outdoor straightaway . Every two weeks , beginners and intermediates can increase either the intensity of the workout or the amount of exercise time by 5 percent . However , do n't increase both intensity and duration together MHR stands for maximum heart rate . To measure your MHR as called for in the chart at right and throughout this workout , subtract your age from 220 . Then , multiply that number by the percentage for your interval level . For example , if you 're 30 years old and a beginner doing the Days 1 and 3 workout , multiply 190 by 60 percent , which gives you an MHR of 114 ( 190 X .60=114 ) . This means you need to keep your heart rate at 114 beats per minute for 30 minutes . While exercising you can determine your heart rate by taking your pulse and counting the beats for 10 seconds . Then , multiply by 6 to get your 1-minute heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count at 10 seconds , , your MHR is 90 , which means you 're not working hard enough . BETTER CARDIO WORKOUTS The sure-fire way to an effective cardio workout ? A heartrate monitor . // days 1 and 3 day 2 day 4 Photograph Photograph Start Me Up : T-shirt by San Francisco City Lights ; bikini by Nike Swim . // Shape put monitors from 10 top manufacturers through their paces to pick the three best in accuracy , features and convenience . Exercise physiologist Daniel Kosich , Ph.D. , of Aurora Denver Cardiology Associates in Denver , tested for accuracy on volunteer runners by comparing the monitors ' readings to those on his electrocardiogram ( ECG ) machine . " They 're all ECG accurate , " he says . " After that your choice is subjective . " Kosich evaluated runners " comments and his own observations on each monitor 's features and ease of use . Almost all have a variety of desirable added functions , such as outside-target-zone alarms , time , day , date and stopwatch . The majority include a bicycle-mount adapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all are suitable for any but underwater activities - and a few were even water resistant . One proviso : " Monitors that claim to give caloric expenditure are at best questionable , " warns Kosich . " They base the calories-expended figure on body weight and heart rate without including the workload factor , such as speed or grade , so the number is likely to be off by a lot of calories .
