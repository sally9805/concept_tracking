BOY 'S LIFE UNCOVERS THE ANSWER TO THIS AND OTHER VEXING BASEBALL QUESTIONS . // DOES PUTTING CORK INTO A BASEBRLL BAT MAKE THE BALL FLY FARTHER ? WHY IS A SUPERSLOW PITCH LIKE A KNUCKLEBALL SO HARD TO HIT ? DOES A CURVEBALL REALLY CURVE ? Fans question these and other baseball theories each season . Now , we have the answers , straight from major-league players and scientific experts . Q1 DOES A CORKED BAT MAKE THE BALL GO FARTHER ? fig.1 Cork is a thick , elastic substance that comes from evergreen oak trees in Europe and Africa . Corking the bat makes it lighter by one to two ounces and moves the center of gravity closer to the batter 's hands for a quicker swing . A quicker swing makes the ball go faster and farther . Or so the theory goes . Implanting cork reduces the bat 's mass , which generates the power , says Dr. Alan Nathan , a University of Illinois physics professor . So the two effects cancel each other . Quicker swing plus lighter bat equals same power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singles hitter because he can get the bat around quicker , but cork does n't make the ball travel farther . Q2 WHY DOES AN ALUMINUM BAT WEIGHING THE SAME AS A WOOD BAT FEEL LIGHTER ? fig.2 Aluminum bats are hollow ; wood bats are solid . The weight in an aluminum bat is distributed more evenly and toward the handle . Most of the weight of a wood hat is at the barrel end . When the point where the weight is equal on both sides is farther from your hands , as with a wood bat , it is harder to generate the same bat speed . Bat speed means the ball comes off the hat faster . Also , the thin shell of an aluminum bat compresses or bends inward when it connects with the ball , producing a trampoline effect and propelling the ball farther , Dr. Nathan says . Aluminum bats are against the rules in professional baseball because of the unfair advantage they provide the hitter ( not to mention the danger they pose to the pitcher ) . // How does eye black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glare from the sun or stadium lights . That makes it easier fop ballplayers , like the Cincinnati Reds1 Sean Casey , to see the ball . A Yale University study found black eye grease works much betten than anti-glare stickers in reducing eye glane for athletes . Using natural sunlight as their light source , the researchers found there was about one level of eye sensitivity improvement when athletes used black eye grease compared to using no product . Is sliding headfirst better ? Tampa Bay Devil Rays outfielden Carl Crawfard learned the hard way why sliding headfirst is n't always the safest way to steal a base . While in the minor leagues , Crawfond extended his hands stealing a base and dislocated a finger during his dive . He has rarely slid headfirst again . " A lot of times guys go headfirst because that tends to make them look like they 're getting there fasten , " says Crawford , who led the Amenican League with 55 stolen bases as a rookie in 2003 . " But I do n't think there is any certain way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable with . " Here 's the science : A body has momentum it translates into horizontal energy when sliding . So it may create more of that energy sliding feet-first . Since less of your body is in contact with the ground sliding feetfirst , there is less friction with the ground . There is no statistical evi- dence to indicate one way is more effective than another . " I tell kids to slide feetfirst because it 's technically the proper way to slide , " Crawfond says . Because of safety concerns , many youth baseball leagues have banned headfirst sliding . Q3 WHY DO BATS BREAK ? WHY NOT MAKE THEM STRONGER ? fig.3 Although not visible , the bai vibrates or moves back and forth as one swings it . If the ball hits the bat on the " sweet spot , " that middle of the fat pant of the bat , the batten feels almost nothing . But if you hit it off the label or lower on the bat you feel a sting . The bat is vibrating most near the middie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baseball tip : When you 're in your batting stance waiting far the pitch , make sure the label of the bat is pointing up . ) Mountain ash is the wood of choice for majop-leaguers because it has the best ratio of density to strength . You can find wood that 's stronger , but it will also be denser and heavier . EXTRA CREDIT Does a curveball really curve ? The key to a good curveball is the grip . The grip will put a spin on the ball , and as the ball encounters air resistance , one side experiences less air resistance than the other ( due to the spin ) . The result : A curveball really curves . Florida Martins left-hander Dontrelle Willis throws a combination curve and slider , with the ball moving in to jam right-handed hitters and staying away from lefties . To achieve this effect , Willis says he does n't put his fingers on the red seams of the baseball , as many pitchers do , but between them . That way he can better control the ball . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming in hard , and then it moves or rotates left to right as it gets to the hitter , " says Willis , the 2003 National League Rookie of the Year . " It 's deception on top of the velocity because the hitter looks at your arm and hand as you release the ball and you want to make him guess wrong . " Another factor to a curving ball is the stitches . The stitches on a ball will create pressure on one side and the fonce will move fasten to one side . Because of the stitches , fastballs also have some curve in them . It is a vertical curve , however , due to the ball spinning in an up-and-down motion instead of side-to-side . " It 's not just an optical illusion . " says Dr. Bill Harrison , a sports performance specialist . " It goes up when it leaves the pitcher 's hand , then it comes down . The spin also slows the pitch . " What happens when a curveball does n't curve ? You get the dreaded-to pitchers-hanging curveball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That happens when you do n't get on top of the ball or throw it without the proper arm action , " Willis says . Q4 WHY DO PLAYERS WEAR SPIKES ? fig.4 Spikes give players maximum traction in the batten 's box and running the bases . The infield is often slick , so you need friction for maximum footing . While the improved traction of spikes and cleats may enhance play , they also leave the ankle more susceptible to twists and turns . Photograph Photograph // Q5 DO HITS FLY FARTHER IN THIN aIR ? fig.5 Yes . Once the baseball leaves the bat , two forces act to bring the ball down . Gravity brings it straight down . Friction with the air slows it . Gravity is nearly the same in every ballpark . But the density of air decreases rapidly with increasing altitude . Decreasing density means fewer air molecules to rub against a soaring baseball , creating less friction and a longer fly ball in high-altitude places like Denver , Colo. less density = less friction Q6 WHAT MAKES A KNUCKLEBALL DANCE ? fig.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrist . This keeps the ball from spinning like other pitches and makes its movement unpredictable . The knuekiebau dances up and down and side to side because of the increased amount of air resistance that acts on the seams of the superslow ball , which travels almost half as fast as a typical major-league fastball . Most big-league hitters will tell you the knuckleball is the most difficult pitch to hit . ( Most big-league catchers will tell you the knuckleball is also the most difficult pitch to catch. ) weight = ( mass ) ( acceleration of gravity ) How fast is a fastball ? It takes about four-tenths of a second for a 90-plus mile per hour fastball to get from the pitcher 's hand to home plate . That 's about three blinks of the eye . Why is a 95-m.p.h. fastball so much more effective than a 90 ? You have to make a decision whether to swing based on limited information . So that extra five miles an hour makes about a 15 percent difference in how quickly the ball gets to home plate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Bill Harrison has helped Kansas City first baseman Mike Sweeney increase his recognition time by being able to focus more cleanly on the pitcher 's hand as the ball is released . " He helped me develop my depth perception , " said Sweeney , who has a stellar .307 career batting average . " The drills he does with you sharpen your vision . You can go out in the cage and hit for two hours , but guys do n't do eye training . That only takes five minutes a day , but it 's so vital to being a successful hitter . " <p>
