Mr. Paradise A Novel Chapter One Late afternoon Chloe and Kelly were having cocktails at the Rattlesnake Club , the two seated on the far side of the dining room by themselves : Chloe talking , Kelly listening , Chloe trying to get Kelly to help her entertain Anthony Paradiso , an eighty-four-year-old guy who was paying her five thousand a week to be his girlfriend . Now Chloe was offering Kelly a cigarette from a pack of Virginia Slims , the long ones , the 120 's . They 'd made their entrance , the early after-work crowd still looking , speculating , something they did each time the two came in . Not showgirls . More like fashion models : designer casual wool coats , oddball pins , scarves , big leather belts , definitely not bimbos . They could be sisters , tall , the same type , the same nose jobs , both remembered as blonds , their hair cropped short . Today they wore hats , each a knit cloche down on her eyes , and sunglasses . It was April in Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The waitress , a young blond named Emily , came through the room of white tablecloths and place settings with their drinks , alexanders straight up , with gin . She said as she always did , " I 'm sorry , but you 're not supposed to smoke in here . It 's okay in the bar . " Kelly looked at Emily in her black pants and starched white shirt . " Has your boss said anything ? " " He has n't yet . " " So forget about it , " Chloe said . " He likes us . " She brought a Ritz-Carlton ashtray from her coat pocket and placed it on the table , Emily watching . She said , " They 're always from a different hotel . I like the one , I think it 's from the Sunset Marquis ? " " It 's one of my favorites , " Chloe said . " Next time I 'm in L.A. I 'll pick up a few more . " Emily said , " Cool hats , " and left . Kelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a little weird . " " She 's a fan , " Chloe said . " Fans are weird . " " I 'll bet anything she comes back with a catalog . " " What 're you in this month ? " " Saks , Neiman Marcus  --  she 'll have Victoria 's Secret . " " Remember she asked if I modeled , " Chloe said , " and I told her now and then but mostly I did hands ? She said , Oh . " " You called it hand jobs . Show her your Playboy spread , she 'll freak , " Kelly said , and saw Emily coming back through the tables with a catalog , holding it to her breast with two hands , Victoria 's Secret , a look of pain on Emily the waitress 's face , hesitant now as she stood before Kelly . " I hope you guys do n't think I 'm a pest . " " I do n't mind , " Kelly said . " What page ? " Emily gave her the catalog and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could you sign it like right above your navel ? " " I 'm in the Seamless Collection , " Kelly said , " Second Skin 's the next page , " and wrote Kelly in black over bare flesh . " I 'm in another one somewhere . " " Page forty-two , " Emily said , " the new low-rise bikini . And on the next page , the low-rise v-string and low-rise thong ? " Kelly turned pages until she was looking at herself in white panties . " You want each one signed ? " " If you would n't mind . I really appreciate it . " Chloe said to her , " Which one do you have on ? " Emily made a face , clenching her teeth . " I 'm trying the v-string . " " Feels good ? " Emily squirmed a little . " It 's okay . " " I ca n't wait to get them off , " Kelly said . She handed Emily the catalog . " I kinda like the way a thong grabs you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if you want to know why , ask the old man . " Emily left . And Chloe said , " Are n't you glad you 're not a waitress ? " " Yeah , but I think I 'd be good at it , " Kelly said . " I 'd take orders for a table without writing anything down . The woman with blue hair , the whitefish , the scotch drinker , pickerel . And I would n't call them ' you guys . ' " " Your style , " Chloe said , " make it look easy . But you fly to New York to work instead of living there . " " The traffic , " Kelly said . " You spend most of your time waiting for it to move . " " So what ? You 're sitting in a limo . " " I like to drive . " " You could work for Vicki 's full-time , make a lot more money . " " I do okay . " " Go to parties with movie stars  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wrong with that ? " " I have to be in love . Or think I am . " They sipped their alexanders and smoked their cigarettes and Chloe said , " Hon ... I desperately need you . " " I ca n't , I have to take my dad to the airport . " " He 's still here ? " " Playing the slots all day and giving me advice at dinner . He thinks I should get a new agent . " " Is n't he a barber ? " " He has time to think about things . " " Get him a taxi . " " I want to be sure he makes the flight . My dad drinks . " " Ca n't we work around it ? I 'm talking about three hours , max . By midnight the old guy 's asleep in his chair . He even nods off while we 're talking , drops his cigar . I have to watch he does n't set himself on fire . " " Not tonight , " Kelly said , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were good friends and had been sharing a loft the past couple of years , Kelly saying , " If I did go with you sometime , would I have to do anything ? " She would n't mind getting a look at Mr. Paradiso . The way Kelly understood the arrangement , the old man was laying out five thousand a week to have Chloe available , all to himself .
