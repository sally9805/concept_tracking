But that 's not the reason to like it . It is an armchair journey to the world 's most talked about buildings ; it is a barometer of what is going on around the world ; and a way to understand that many ideas are global cross-pollinations and do n't exist in a vacuum . <p> At the same time , the projects show that regional ideas influence outcomes ; even when forms repeat .

But this 850-year-old city , formerly in the shadow of nearby Augsburg , home to the powerful family , wealthy bankers to popes who were akin to Silicon Valley venture capitalists an example of Augsburg 's elaborate Fuggerian inlaid furniture from the 16th century is at San Francisco 's Legion of Honor , is also Germany 's third-largest city .

It has a superb collection of paintings by and one of the world 's largest museum collections of modern furniture and designs , ranging from classic bentwood pieces to lighting fixtures by New York 's , who recently moved to Munich . <p> The 11th annual Venice architecture Biennale closed Sunday . The festivals for art , music , film , architecture and design - held at permanent pavilions in gardens close to the island city 's unused Arsenale and on Lido island - are often overshadowed by the drama of slowly-sinking Venice itself . There 's hardly a building with straight walls . <p> This year 's theme , " Out There : Architecture Beyond Building , " by , a former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does a city have architecture ?

It showed a plywood model of Utzon 's house , as well as full-scale sections for the opera house , which were covered with glazed tile like the kind used on Persian domes , except they 're white . From the Accademia you can also walk to the Palazzo Fortuny museum where , amid genuine lamps and dresses , we saw a work inspired by abstract art . Nearby , ' s sparkling new steel and glass modernist footbridge , close to the Piazzale Roma bus station , is a reminder that Venetians are simply not ready to let their city vanish . <p> Find Documents with Similar Topics Help Below are concepts discussed in this document .
