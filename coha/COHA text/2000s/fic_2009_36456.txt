Dover , Delaware , 2003 <br> <p> The soldiers keep Dorothy in view . She carries the tripod , unsteadily , and an extra poncho for a bib . That they have let her come this far might be due to weather , or possibly the kinds of amusements of which she remains unaware . Still , she assumes that they watch , tracking her as she stomps along the fence and positions herself by the sign that clearly states : No Trespassing , Government Property , Photography Forbidden . <p> It has turned a wet September , everywhere raining so the leaves , black and slick , paste to the soles of her boots . Really , they are Caroline 's , Wellingtons borrowed from the back of the hallway closet where earlier Dorothy rummaged as Charles watched , wondering where she could possibly be going in such weather . <p> She turned , boot in hand . <p> " It 's raining , " he repeated . <p> Deaf at most decibels , Charles refused to wear aids ( vanity ? fear ? ) , preferring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echo or a nod . <p> " Nowhere , " she had said , because this is nowhere , or anywhere , or somewhere not particularly known : an hour 's drive north if you took the busy roads , and then country , mostly , the drizzle graying the already gray landscape . Ye olde etcetera  --  cornfields , silos , a ravaged billboard for Daniel 's peas , fresh from California , though this is technically Delaware and the land of soybeans . Ducks , too , the fall season in full swing ; the drizzle split by the crack crack crack of the hunters ' guns . <p> She parks near the drainage ditch that edges the fence , chain link , as if for dogs , though there are no dogs here , only a guard tower , a landing field , and the soldiers who wait for the planes . But that is n't right , exactly . The place is vast , a city of a place , with barracks  --  are those called barracks ?  --  and trucks and cul-de-sacs and no doubt children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in the two-story housing labyrinth not so distant from where she gets out , near the drainage ditch , near the landing field , near the place where the plane will descend . This she knows . The rest  --  the presence of children , the numbers involved , the ranking , the hierarchy  --  she truthfully has no idea . <p> Dorothy skewers the tripod in the mud and adjusts the poncho to cover her . Today , she plans to fight back . She can almost taste it ; see herself in her resistance : Dorothy Barrett , granddaughter to the suffragette , mother to three : Caroline , Liz , and the dead one , James ; wife to Charles . She mounts the camera on the track and angles the lens toward where the plane will descend  --  they come from the East , she has learned , out of Mecca , the bodies mostly coffined , then wrapped in flags , but sometimes carried in a tiny box . <br> <p> " Christ , Mother , " Caroline said after the first arrest , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your great-grandmother starved to death on principle ; she literally ate nothing . " <p> " I know , I know . I 've seen the postage stamp , " Caroline said . <p> " I think it changed things then , " Dorothy said . " To do something . She made up her mind ; she took a stand  --  " <p> " And look what happened to your dad ? Anyway , you said she might have been unbalanced . A bit insane , was n't she ? You 've said that before . She might have been suffering from  --  " <p> " Hysteria ? " Dorothy said , hearing her own tone of voice  --  hysterical . " The point is , she did something . " <p> " It 's illegal to take pictures there . " <p> " This is a free country . " <p> " Please , " Caroline said . <p> The two sat at Caroline 's kitchen table , Caroline in one of her suits meant for business , her cigarette burning in the ashtray a tenyear- old James had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorothy , is elsewhere , having reached the age of the disappeared  --  her voice shouting orders from behind the locked door of her bedroom or even standing present , her body a studded cast of her former self ; if she is somewhere within it she is very , very deep . <p> " I should never have told you I voted for him , " Caroline said . <p> " I would have guessed . " <p> " Consider my client base , " Caroline said . <p> " Please , " Dorothy said . <p> " Anyway , the law has to do with respect , " Caroline said . " Or something . They make the rules for a reason , I 'm sure . It 's none of our business . None of your business . " <p> " Says who ? " Dorothy said , to which Caroline had some sort of reply . <p> Dorothy listened for a while , and then she did not ; she thought of other things , how she would like to have believed that not so long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she , former president of the student council and Future Leaders for Justice , might have carried a sign or at least shouted an obscenity . But this was before Caroline divorced and took that new job in the Financial District . The Dead Zone , she called it , but the money 's good , she said . It 's serious money . <p> " Mother ? " <p> " I was listening , " Dorothy said . <p> " Forget it , " Caroline said . She tapped her nails , those nails , on the table , then the doorbell rang  --  pizza delivery  --  and the conversation ended . <p> " Dinnertime , " she yelled in the direction of the door . <br> <p> Crack . Crack . Crack . <p> The soldiers have had enough . They climb down from their tower to slog through duck country , technically Delaware , the first state , though most have trouble with the history ; one can hear their boots , or is that frogs ? The sucking . Soon enough they 'll reach her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate and stepping to the other side , records their blank expressions . The trouble is she can only pretend to hate them . <p> " Good morning , Mrs. Barrett . " This from the one Dorothy calls Tweedledee . <p> She straightens up , adjusts the poncho . <p> " We 'll remind you that you 're trespassing . That taking photographs is forbidden . " <p> " Today , " she says , hand on tripod . " I plan to resist . " <p> Their arms remain folded . Four pair , as usual ; a pack ; a team ; a unit , perhaps , or would they be a regiment ? No , a regiment is bigger , a regiment is many . She tries to remember from mornings James explained the exact order of things  --  sergeant to lieutenant to captain to king  --  his miniature warriors arranged throughout the house in oddly purposeful groupings . She would find them everywhere , assaulting a sock , scaling the Ping-Pong table , plastic , molded men with clearly defined weaponry and indistinct faces . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip and break a bone , James had cried and cried . <p> " That would be more than your usual fine , Mrs. Barrett . " <p> He is a horse 's ass , but then again , a boy once James 's age , who should be pitied . <p> " I plan to resist , " she repeats . One of the Mute Ones has his and out as if to help her across the muddy plain . They are waiting , she knows , for Dorothy to do something . Collapse , she thinks , then does , more a buckle than a collapse , knowing full well the ridiculousness of it , how small she 'll become . The big one bends down to help her . Now , she thinks , though it is not until it is done that she understands she has found the courage to do it , biting the soft part of that hand , the hammock of skin between thumb and forefinger . <p> <br> <p> Caroline sits next to Charles in the detention waiting room , no question who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles had once said . We ought to lease her to GE . <p> Sorry , darling , Dorothy mouths to him . He looks at her with his doggy yellow eyes not hearing a thing ; then Caroline leads them both out . <p> In the fresh sunshine they blink ; " Look how the weather 's changed ! " Dorothy says , reflexively . " What a treat ! " <p> Caroline has opened the car door . <p> " Get in , " she says . <p> They sit in silence all the way home , the radio punched to static and static and static then punched off , again , then the familiar drive , the front door , the hallway , the kitchen . Caroline makes tea and calls a **27;0;TOOLONG Meeting , Liz trapped in the city , attempting another pregnancy ( busy , busy , busy ! ) , and the hole in the place where James would have been . Dorothy steps into it and wanders around while Caroline speaks of Responsibility and Reputation and Appropriate Behavior , and yes , Patriotism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " And what of history ? " Dorothy says . " Lineage ? " <p> " Mother , " Caroline says . " I 'm at wit 's end . " <p> Dorothy would like to cradle Caroline in her arms , Caroline sleepy and hatted and a bit jaundice yellow , but she can not . Caroline has grown ; she 's taller than Dorothy and now divorced and a multimillionaire , she has confessed . Mill-ions , she said . <p> " Where are your friends , Mother ? " Caroline asks . <p> Dorothy shrugs . She has n't thought of friends recently , nor her standing Wednesday at Sheer Perfection ; her hair 's gone shaggy and her cuticles have grown over their moons . <p> " I 'm sorry , darling , " she says . " I 'll stop . " <p> Copyright 2009 by Kate Walbert <br> Continues ...
