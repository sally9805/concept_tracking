" Dancing Queen , " Sara Linton mumbled with the music as she made her way around the skating rink . " Young and sweet , only seventeen . " She heard a furious clicking of wheels to her left and turned just in time to catch a small child before he crashed into her . " Justin ? " she asked , recognizing the seven year old . She held him up by the back of his shirt as his ankles wobbled over his in-line skates . " Hey , Dr. Linton , " Justin managed around gasps for breath . His helmet was too big for his head , and he pushed it back several times as he tried to look up at her . Sara returned his smile , trying not to laugh . " Hello , Justin . " " I guess you like this music , huh ? My mom likes it , too . " He stared at her openly , his lips slightly parted . Like most of Sara 's patients , Justin seemed a bit shocked to see her outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she lived in the basement there , waiting for them to get colds or fevers so she could see them . " Anyway , " Justin pushed back his helmet again , knocking himself in the nose with his elbow pad . " I saw you singing it . " " Here , " Sara offered , leaning down to adjust the chin strap . The music in the rink was so loud that Sara could feel the bass vibrating through the plastic buckle as she tightened it under his chin . " Thanks , " Justin yelled , then for some reason he put both his hands on top of the helmet , as if to rest them . The motion threw him off balance , and he stumbled , clamping on to Sara 's leg . Sara grabbed his shirt again and led them both over to the safety railing lining the rink . After trying on a pair of in-line skates herself , Sara had asked for the old four-wheel kind , not wanting to fall on her ass in front of half the town . " Wow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railing for support . He was looking down at her skates . " Your feet are so huge ! " Sara looked down at her skates , feeling a flush of embarrassment . She had been teased about her large feet since she was seven years old . After nearly thirty years of hearing it , Sara still felt the urge to hide under the bed with a bowl of chocolate-fudge ice cream . " You 're wearing boy 's skates ! " Justin screeched , letting go of the rail so that he could point at her black skates . Sara caught him just before he hit the ground . " Sweety , " Sara whispered politely into his ear . " Remember this when you 're due for your booster shots . " Justin managed a smile for his pediatrician . " I think my mom wants me , " he mumbled , edging along the rail , hand over hand , casting a wary eye over his shoulder to make sure Sara was not following him . She crossed her arms , leaning against the railing as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most pediatricians shared , but there was something to be said for not spending her Saturday night surrounded by them . " That your date ? " Tessa asked , coming to a stop beside her . Sara gave her sister a hard look . " Remind me how I got roped into this . " Tessa tried to smile . " Because you love me ? " " Right , " Sara returned caustically . Across the rink , Sara picked out Devon Lockwood , Tessa 's latest boyfriend , who also worked in the Linton family 's plumbing business . Devon was leading his nephew around the kiddy rink while his brother watched . " His mother hates me , " Tessa mumbled . " She gives me nasty looks every time I get near him . " " Daddy 's the same way about us , " Sara reminded her . Devon noticed them staring and waved . " He 's good with children , " Sara noted , returning his wave . " He 's good with his hands , " Tessa said in a low voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Speaking of which , where 's Jeffrey ? " Sara looked back at the front entrance , wondering that herself . Wondering , too , why she cared whether or not her ex-husband showed up . " I do n't know , " she answered . " When did this place get so packed ? " " It 's Saturday night and football season has n't started ; what else are people going to do ? " Tessa asked , but did not let Sara change the subject . " Where 's Jeffrey ? " " Maybe he wo n't come . " Tessa smiled in a way that let Sara know she was holding back a snide comment . " Go ahead and say it . " " I was n't going to say anything , " Tessa said , and Sara could not tell if she was lying or not . " We 're just dating . " Sara paused , wondering whom she was trying to convince , Tessa or herself . She added , " It 's not even serious . " " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tessa held up her palms in resignation . " I know , " she repeated , a smirk on her lips . " Just a few dates . That 's all . " " You do n't have to convince me . " Sara groaned as she leaned back against the railing . She felt stupid , like a teenager instead of a grown woman . She had divorced Jeffrey two years ago after catching him with the woman who owned the sign shop in town . Why she had started seeing him again was as much a mystery to Sara as it was to her family . A ballad came on , and the lights dimmed . Sara watched the mirrored ball drop down from the ceiling , scattering little squares of light all over the rink . " I need to go to the bathroom , " Sara told her sister . " Will you keep an eye out for Jeff ? " Tessa glanced over Sara 's shoulder . " Somebody just went in . " " There are two stalls now . " Sara turned toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large teenage girl go in . Sara recognized the girl as Jenny Weaver , one of her patients . She waved , but the girl did n't see her . Tessa muttered , " Hope you can wait . "
