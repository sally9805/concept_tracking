IV ) , but it developed into its recognizable form in Scotland probably in the middle of the sixteenth century . The " royal " element of the name comes from the fact that many of the kings and some of the queens of Scotland1 enjoyed the game and spent a great deal of money buying equipment and wagering on matches . For example , in February 1503 the lord high treasurer for Scotland recorded that James IV ( r. 1488-1513 ) had purchased " golf clubs and balls and wagered at golf with the Earl of Bothwell . " 2 In the early eighteenth century the game came to America , where it was popular among the well-todo of Scots descent .

" 4 Photograph // The earliest record of golf clubs and balls being exported from Scotland to the colonies in sufficient quantities to warrant notice in the official port records was in 1743 . On May 12 of that year the ship Magdalene set sail from Leith , Scotland , for Charleston , carrying Scots shirts , salt , eight dozen golf clubs , and three gross of golf balls.5 In 1786 the South Carolina Golf Club , the first American golf club , or society , was established in Charleston A notice in the Charleston City Gazette , or , the Daily Advertiser on September 24 , 1790 , recorded that " the annual meeting of the South Carolina Golf Club will be held on Wednesday 29th instant at Williams Coffee House at two o'clock , " and similar notices appeared yearly until 1799 . The game continued to be played in the United States into the early nineteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems hardly to have been played at all in the United States from about 1812 until the 1880s , when several golf clubs sprang up : Oakhurst Links in White Sulphur Springs , West Virginia , the Tuxedo Club in Tuxedo Park , New York ; Foxburg Club in Pennsylvania ; and the Dorset Field Club in Vermont . In the succeeding decades the game 's popularity mushroomed . A golfer , or goffer as he was known , played with a group of clubs , mostly woods and perhaps an iron or two . The shape and style of clubs changed very little from earliest times until the mid-nineteenth century Wooden clubs were usually made by specialist joiners who also made other sporting equipment , such as the longbows used in archery . William St. Clair ( or Sinclair ) of Roslin , a champion archer , was also a famous golfer . The portrait of him in Plate V not only gives details of his club but also of the usual golfing attire , including the kid gloves with the fingertips cut off , presumably for a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , used to play off the grassy " fair going " ( or fairway ) , usually included a play club , or driver , for teeing off ; various so-called spoons , which were shaped to give different lofts to the ball ; and a putter , used on smooth turf near the hole . One historian has calculated that wooden clubs lasted for only about twelve rounds , with spoons breaking most often . Wooden clubs required two properties : a head sufficiently hard to withstand successive hits on the ball and a springy , or whippy , shaft . These two properties do not coexist in any native British timber , so it was customary to splice a hard head onto a whippy shaft . European hazel ( Corylus avellana ) , which was generally used for woven fence panels or as infill in the timber framing of medieval buildings , was favored for shafts certainly by the late seventeenth century . Coppiced , it produced tall straight shoots one inch or so in diameter in five to seven years . By the early eighteenth century ash ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mideighteenth century , hickory ( Carya ) began to be exported to Scotland from North America , probably from the area that became Tennessee , for use as the shafts of wooden clubs . Shafts could be ripped by handsaw from one-inch planks cut with a pit saw , or they were sometimes split from a billet with a file , or wedge . The four corners of squaresection shafts were planed to produce eight corners , which in turn were planed to sixteen , thirty-two , or even sixty-four . Final smoothing was sometimes done with a file , judging by file marks on some surviving shafts , although smoothing was also done with broken bottle glass or dried fish skin ( such as that of dogfish or small rays ) , followed by rubbing with Dutch rush ( Equisitum hyemale ) , a low-growing plant with stems that contain significant amounts of silica .

Hawthorn head and ash shaft with wool listing grip , length approximately 48 inches overall . Private collection . // The heads were generally made from hawthorn ( Crataegus ) , a common hedgerow plant that grows to a maximum trunk diameter of five or six inches if allowed to mature . An approximately six-inch length of trunk with an oblique branch at one end could be split in half to produce a head requiring only final shaping . The split side branch formed the neck of the club , which was spliced and glued to the shaft and then bound with pitched thread to waterproof the joint . The head was shaped with a bow saw , then rasped , filed , and smoothed like the shaft . Lead was poured into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that it would give greater momentum to the struck ball . A quarter-inch-deep strip of ram 's horn was pegged to a recess in the front of the sole to protect the head from striking the turf ( see Pls. lb and Villa ) . The club was finished with a grip made by winding cloth selvage ( in Scotland called listing ) over a layer of pitch around the top of the shaft , with the ends of the cloth held in place by nails . Judging by the darkening of the surfaces of extant early woods , the clubs were likely given a final protective finishing coat of linseed oil . By the late eighteenth century red keel-usually while lead paint colored with red oxide-was applied to the heads , both as decoration and as a preservative ( see Pl . VII ) . Also about this time , makers began to stamp their names on clubs , among them Robert Neilson of Leith , Simon Cossar of Leith ( see Pl . VI ) , and James McEwan of Bruntsfield ( see Pls . VIIa and VIIIb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be used when playing out the rough or off sand or shingle , where the graceful longnecked woods would simply have broken if used . They cost several times more than woods , but of course lasted longer ; for every surviving early wood , there are perhaps five irons of the same vintage . Irons could have been made by blacksmiths or armorers , but are more likely the work of toolmakers . The considerable skills required to produce a socket and forged to make a socket chisel , virtually the only difference being that the blade of the chisel was hammered out to form the head of an iron club . Early on , the toe was squared , but rounded toes appeared in the last quarter of the eighteenth century . During the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries it was customary for irons clubs to have a curved or dished face , which promoted easy lofting of the ball . Becase iron heads were so heavy and ungainly , they required shafts that were thicker and stiffer than those on woods .

Oil on canvas , 51 by 41 3/8 inches . Scottish NAtional Portraint Gallery . // The earliest golf balls were made of solid boxwood ( Buxus sempervirens ) , but these were superseded by feather=stuffed balls of rawhide by the early seventeenth centum ( see Pls . II , III , and X ) . In 1618 James Melville , quartermaster to the carl of Morton , was granted a patent for making such balls after complaining that too much gold and silver was leaving Scotland to purichase ill balls made in Holland , from hick they had been exported to Scotland since 1486.8 As late as 1850 a single ball cost between 2s , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $400 today . A serious wager match required the golfer 's caddy to carry about half a dozen balls , their cost alone being sufficient explanation for why golf was a game for royalty . The balls were probably made by a souter ( a shoemaker or cobbler ) , whose stitching skills were essential to producing a good ball . The ball was constructed from rawhide , often bull 's hide , ca quarterinch thick . Two hide disks were sewn to a central strip of hide , with a gap left in one of the scams , through which the little pouch was turned inside out . A top hat full of boiled feathers-usually chicken or goose but sometimes duck or pheasant feathers-was then crammed inside : the gap was stiched ; the ball was hammered to make it as spherical as possible ; and then it was allowed to dry slowly . The hide shrank , becoming very hard , while the feathers expanded trying to resume their natural fluffy form , resulting in a ball nealy as hard as wood but with a little more give to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 160 to 180 yards , but if the ball absorbed a lot of water it was much more difficult to hit a good distance . A miss hit on a stiched seam might result in a cloud of feathers . Feather ball remained the norm until about 1850 , when gutta percha was introduced , making balls somewhat cheaper . The golf clubs and balls illustrated in this article are all of Scottish maufacture , and while some are from private collections in the United States , no examples actually used in colonial America have come to light . I hope that this article misht help change that situation , providing material documentation of the game 's early popularity in this country . Photograph Pls . XIIa , XIIb , XIIc .
