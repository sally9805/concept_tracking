10 A BAYOU WITH A VIEW // You never know when you get up in the // morning what earth-shaking event // might take place and change your life // forever . For me , a chain of such events // began when I checked my e-mail one day // in February 2004 . Just a few days // earlier , a kayaker named Gene // Sparling  --  the same man Larry Mallard had // told me about a few weeks earlier  --  had // spotted an unusual woodpecker // foraging on a huge cypress tree in a // long , narrow bayou in eastern Arkansas . // When he saw the bird 's unique color // pattern  --  brilliant white on the lower half // of its back , with two white lines // extending up the back to its crested head  --  // he knew immediately that he had never // seen this kind of bird before . // Inconspicuous in his kayak , he pulled // into a secluded spot and sat watching // it for almost a full minute . The // woodpecker was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feathers and even // some greenish staining on the lower // part of its back , perhaps from going in // and out of a roost hole or nest . // When he got home a few days later , Gene // posted a long // description of his trip on a canoe club // listserver , and he included a couple of // sentences about the woodpecker , buried // toward the end of the piece . His e- // mail report was forwarded to me , and I // immediately called him up . I grilled // him for about an hour . His sighting // sounded better than a lot of the // thirty-year- // old reports I had been investigating , // and it was less than a week old . // Gene has pileated woodpeckers nesting // on his farm in Hot // Springs , in the western part of // Arkansas , so he is thoroughly familiar with // that species . It seemed unlikely that a // pileated was what he had seen . What // struck me most about his description was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of its quick , // jerky movements and general // nervousness . Its neck looked thinner // than a pileated 's , and its crest seemed // to come to a point in the back . // I telephoned Bobby and told him about // the sighting . Then I asked // if he would mind calling Gene and // talking to him . I was interested in getting // his impression , to see if it was the // same as mine . // After a long talk with Gene , Bobby told // him , " It sounds to me like // you 've seen an ivory-billed woodpecker. " // " You think so ? " said Gene . " I do n't // have enough confidence to // make that call , but I 'm glad to hear you // say that . " // Before they got off the phone , Bobby // was already planning a trip // to the sighting area , at Bayou de View // in the Cache River National Wildlife // Refuge , and Gene was going to go with // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour later , and she told me , // " You should go along with him . You 'll // never forgive yourself if he sees an // ivory-bill and you 're not there . " // I did n't need much encouragement . I did // a quick search on the // Internet to find a good airline ticket // price and then called up Bobby . " Say , you // think you could pick me up in Memphis on // the way down ? " // " No problem , " he said . " I go right // through there . " // And that was it : the start of our // adventure . A week later I was on // my way south again , for the second time // in a month . // Gene Sparling told us to meet him on a // small country road near Clarendon , // Arkansas . He wanted to look at a place // where we could haul out at the end // of our several-day-long float down the // bayou . He had arranged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a // bridge crossing several miles north of // where Gene had seen the strange // woodpecker and to pick us up at the haul- // out point . // We spotted Gene 's red Toyota pickup , // unmistakable with the // canoe and kayak strapped to the top , a // few minutes after turning off the main // road . Gene greeted us enthusiastically , // and we stood on the side of the road // discussing the bird he had seen and our // plans for the next few days . // Gene is an affable man with a deep , // resonant voice and a slow // delivery that reminds me a little of // Eeyore 's . Grizzled and bearded , with // receding red hair and crow 's feet etched // deeply into his weathered face , he // looks older than his forty-eight years . // When we finished talking , Gene told us // to follow him into Clarendon to pick up // Frank . // As we drove along behind him , I said to // Bobby , " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lying . // And I really do n't think he 's a liar . " // Bobby nodded . " I do n't either , " he // said . " His story is completely // believable. " // Gene got confused on the way to Frank 's // house , and we went // driving around and around in a // residential area where everything looked // the // same . He finally found the correct // house . Gene leaves his car at Frank 's // house every time he goes kayaking in // this area . On this trip , Bobby parked // his old van in front of Frank 's house // and left him with the keys . // Frank is a large , jovial man of about // sixty-five who wears cowboy // boots and a leather belt with a huge // silver buckle . He teased Gene // mercilessly as he drove us to our // drop-off point , claiming that Gene must // have a she-bear stashed somewhere in the // bayou that he was always // visiting . " No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn bird , " he said . " I // know you got a she-bear. " // It was bad when Bobby and I first // started canoeing along Bayou de View  --  // real bad . Without any preparation , we // clambered down below the overpass , // loaded up the canoe  --  which Gene had // borrowed from his parents  --  and // pushed off into the latte-brown river // flowing into the swamp . I sat in front and // Bobby in the stern , with all our // equipment piled high between us . I had had // some fairly recent experience canoeing // in the Adirondacks with my kids , and // I had floated to falcon nests in Canada // and other far northern places in the // past , but I was rusty . Bobby had n't // touched a canoe since he was twelve , // and it showed . It was a real grind // hauling ourselves through that morass , at // times practically clawing our way // through the bayou , scrambling up and over // logs and cypress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // pushed together to form a swift-moving // stream . This is where you 're in danger // of flipping over . You bump into a // submerged log or root , then overreact to // compensate , and there you go  --  your canoe // has turned over and all your gear // and supplies are bobbing downstream as // you lie submerged , with brown // swamp water rushing into your mouth . Blech ! // On that first day , it seemed that // whenever we found ourselves // rushing into a treacherous area , Bobby // and I could n't coordinate our // movements to avoid the hazards . I would // point the canoe toward the one // open passage I could see ahead , but // Bobby would inevitably steer in the // other direction , and we would wind up // blasting sideways into the teeth of // disaster . It was the wildest roller // coaster ride I 've ever been on . Somehow we // managed not to swamp the canoe , but a // couple of times I had to jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . Luckily , I was wearing // chest waders . Unluckily , the water was // sometimes deeper than the top of my // waders and came flooding inside . // Bayou de View is a magical place where // wildlife abounds . As we canoed // through the swamp , wood ducks and flocks // of mallards burst from the water // around us . Herds of white-tailed deer , // snorting a loud warning , splashed off // across the shallow water at the edge of // the woods . We saw beavers // swimming past and otters playing . The // loud calls of barred owls and great // horned owls echoed through the dim // recesses of the swamp , even at mid- // day . But most impressive were the // woodpeckers . Everywhere we turned , we // saw pileated , red-bellied , red-headed , // and downy woodpeckers , plus a few // yellow-bellied sapsuckers . It excited us // to remember that Jim Tanner had // written that the woods in the Singer // Tract had the most woodpeckers he had // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Although on the first day we did n't // see any of the huge trees that Gene had // described , we passed some // massive stumps , remnants of the logging // done in the 1800s . And it seemed // that there were trees in every state of // decomposition , ranging from those that // had just a few dying limbs to those that // had tumbled to the swamp floor and // were rotting away to nothing . It was // perfect for woodpeckers , with lots of food // and dead trunks and limbs in which to // forage and dig roost and nest holes . // The three of us found a nice place to // camp on some high ground // near an area of open water . As I was // pitching the tent , though , it began to // dawn on me that I would not spend a // pleasant night here . I had left home so // quickly that I had forgotten to bring my // good tent , down sleeping bag , and // camp pad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // I had said to Bobby when we met in // Memphis that we should stop // at a sporting goods store so I could buy // the equipment I would need before // we hit the swamp . // " Do n't worry , " he told me . " I 've got an // extra tent and sleeping bag // in my van . " // " You sure ? " I asked . " It 'd be no // problem to stop and buy some // more equipment . " // " No , no , " he told me . " I 've got // everything . " // I wish I had gone with my instincts . As // it turned out , the tent // was n't quite waterproof or bugproof and // the sleeping bag had a broken zipper. // And it was much colder than I had // thought it would be . After sleeping // fitfully // for a couple of hours , I woke with a // start at the nearby splash of a beaver // pounding its tail flat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never got back to // sleep . No matter what I did with that // sleeping bag , the cold air just flooded in , // and it was too difficult to get more // clothes from my bags in the middle of the // night . They were packed securely in the // canoe , and I could n't even find my // flashlight . The darkness of that swamp // in the middle of the night was like // nothing I had ever experienced . I // could n't even see my finger an inch from my // eye . So I hunkered in the fetal position // and shivered all night . // Still , it was great getting up the next // morning . Bobby made his // classic swamp breakfast , Dinty Moore // stew in special waterproof packages // for boiling . He put three or four of // them at a time into a bubbling cauldron of // brown swamp water completely unfit for // human consumption , reasoning that // the water could n't get through the // pouches to the food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , because the stew // was about the same color as the // water . Gene said that the last time he // was here , he had run short of drinking // water and had pulled out his special // survival water purification straw , but it // had clogged up after a few quick sips . // He did n't say what the water tasted // like  --  it was probably a bit like Dinty // Moore stew . // On the second day of our trip , we passed // an area where a long-abandoned // railroad trestle , built shortly after // the Civil War , cut through the trees . The // rails and even the rail bed were long // gone , and only stout wooden posts rose // up from the swamp water . We were // starting to feel as if we were really // out in // the wilderness , far from civilization . // We had been grinding along all morning , // and it was tough . Bobby and I tried our // best to keep up with Gene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // maneuverable than our canoe . He could // slip easily through places that // presented impossible barriers to us : // cypress // knees , log jams , tangles of brush and // debris . We often had to back up a long // way and try a different route , fighting // the current back upstream and weaving // around obstacles . // It was an amazing experience spending // time with Gene . He is a // remarkable outdoorsman and has spent his // life doing things like this  --  hiking , // backpacking , horse packing , or kayaking // for days or weeks at a time , in // areas as close to wilderness as he can // find . He used to lead kayak tours in // Baja California , paddling out among the // gray whales . He now owns a big farm // in the mountains near Hot Springs and // leads horseback-riding tours . // Gene was at his best threading his way // stealthily through the // bayou in his kayak . He would always // range a hundred feet or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding places // and sitting silently  --  watching , waiting for // something to happen . His patience was // boundless , and he had such a low // profile in the kayak , he did n't look // human . If anything , animals seemed // curious when they saw him . We would come // along behind him in our canoe // and watch wood ducks , beavers , and // otters flush from just a few yards in // front of him . I had a feeling he would // much rather have been out there alone , // but he wanted someone to confirm his // ivorybill sighting so much that he put // up with us. // Just as we were thinking what a wild // place Bayou de View was , we started to // hear the loud roar of highway traffic // less than a mile downstream . As we // approached the bridge at Highway 17 , the // din from semis was almost // unbearable . Bobby told me that whenever // he looked down on canoeists while // he was driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wishing he could // be down there instead of driving . And // now here he was , one of the lucky // canoe people . The only problem was that // it was now a good hour past noon , // and he had n't eaten so much as a // Snickers bar since breakfast . " Man , we // got ta stop soon , " he said . " I 'm starving // to death . " // Looking around , I could n't see any dry // spots . The woods up and // down the bayou in this area were // inundated . Gene said he remembered // some places downstream , a little past // the highway , where we could stop for // lunch . I said that was fine with me. // Bobby did n't seem too happy , but we // continued on . // We paddled the length of the " lake " // south of 17 ( it was more like // what we would call a pond in New York ) // and turned right into a narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone well ahead of us and was // going to wait for us when he found a // good place to stop for lunch . If it seemed // that we had gotten lost , he would come // looking for us. // As we paddled along , we talked and // joked about floating through // the trackless swamp . Then Bobby started // to grouse that we were being way // too noisy to see any ivory-bills. // " We do n't need to worry about that , " I // said . " The road 's so loud , // they 'll never hear us coming . And who // knows , maybe Gene will chase one // back to us. " // And then it happened . Less than eighty // feet away , a large black- // and-white bird that had been flying // toward us from a side channel of the // bayou to the right came out into the // sunshine and flew across the open // stretch of water directly in front of // us . It started to bank , giving us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a // moment as it pulled up , as if it were // going to land on a tree trunk . " Look at // all the white on its wings ! " I yelled . // Hearing my voice , it veered away from // the tree and continued to fly to the left . // We both cried out simultaneously , // " Ivory-bill ! " // Bobby reached for his camcorder while I // tried to keep track of the // bird . I kept pointing as it flew . I 'm // sure it landed on a tree trunk about // fifty feet // away , because I lost it for about three // seconds , then I had it again , moving in // a straight line through the woods , going // up the bayou for another fifty or sixty // feet , then landing again . It must have // hitched around the trunk each time , // because I could n't see it . When we were // almost to shore , I caught another // glimpse of it flying at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I // lost it // after about ten feet . // We clambered ashore , dragged the canoe // onto the mud , and took // off after the ivory-bill , our camcorders // running . We staggered through boot- // sucking mud and mire , over fallen trees , // and through tangled brush and // briars . It was impossible to move // quietly . We did n't see the bird . // About fifteen minutes later we walked // back to the canoe , just as // Gene was paddling to shore , looking for // us . I glanced at my watch . It was // 1:30 on February 27 , 2004 . I said to // Bobby that we should sit down // separately right away and jot down our // field notes , before we had a chance to // talk about what we had seen and // influence each other . At least we would // have some kind of documentary evidence , // even if we could n't get a // photograph . ( Later , when I was back in // Ithaca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketch he had drawn right // after seeing the bird ; it was virtually // identical to my sketch. ) // My first impression of the bird was // that it was definitely a // woodpecker and looked larger than a // crow . I know that it had white on the // trailing edge of the wing , because // that 's what I honed in on and was looking // for when I mentally evaluated it . The // white was much whiter than I thought it // would be , and the black much // blacker  --  coal black , beautiful . I did n't // notice // any red on the bird , and I did not have // a distinct impression of the bill , // because I had focused at first on the // wing pattern and then on keeping track // of the bird . No knowledgeable person // could have misidentified it . It was // definitely not a pileated woodpecker . It // looked completely different to me. // And we had been seeing dozens of // pileateds and pointing them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // and other characteristics , constantly // asking ourselves whether we could // possibly mistake them for an ivory-bill . No // way . The bird we saw was a different animal . // I 'm glad that both Bobby and I saw the // ivory-bill together . He has // always been the most skeptical person // about ivory-bill sightings I know . // Although he did not believe that these // birds were extinct , he rarely gave // much credence to the reports that came // in from time to time . // About half an hour after the sighting , // he called Norma on his cell // phone . She suffered from diabetes and // asthma , and the medicines she took // for both conditions often worked against // each other and made her sicker . He // was always concerned about her and // usually called her whenever he got to // an area with decent cell-phone // reception . This time , he engaged in // small talk // for about ten minutes , asking how she // was doing , how her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stopped // abruptly and let out a deep sigh . " I saw // an ivory-bill , " he said , and then he // broke down and sobbed . " I saw an ivory- // bill . " Gene and I looked away , and it // was all we could do to keep from crying // ourselves . I saved my tears for a few // days later , as I was driving home from // Rochester airport in the dark . // Gene was ready to leave the bayou right // away and start telling // people about the sighting . He thought // that people at the local office of the // Nature Conservancy should know , and the // officials at the Cache River and // White River National Wildlife Refuges. // " If we tell these people about the bird , // they 'll be able to save this whole // bayou , " he said . // " We ca n't do it , " I told him . " You have // no idea what could happen here . I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // thousand birders showed up next week to // look for the bird ? We have to do this // right , Gene . And besides , we 've got // nothing right now  --  no proof that the bird // really exists . " // " What do you mean ? " he said . " You both // saw it  --  you said it could n't have been // anything else . " // " Yeah , but who the hell are we ? " I said . // " You 're the experts , right ? You 're from // Cornell . That 's why I brought you here . " // " Look , Gene , I 'm a bird magazine // editor , and Bobby teaches art and // photography . We 're not scientists , and // even if we were , we would still need // solid proof . " // Gene was fuming . " We have three // eyewitnesses who saw this bird . Three ! // What more do we need ? " // " We need a picture or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Lab of // Ornithology had been in the canoe with // us , he would say the same thing . We 've // got nothing . But we still have a few // more days to spend out here . Let 's set // up camp somewhere close and start // searching . This is the second sighting // of the bird in this area in two weeks . // We really ought to be able to nail it on // film . " // We agreed to keep things cool for a // couple of days . We could always revisit // this conversation in a few days if we // could n't find the bird . We floated // downstream about a quarter of a mile and // pulled out on a nice piece of higher // ground on the east side of the bayou . A // massive cypress tree , well over a // thousand years old , towered high above // us nearby , surrounded by tupelos , and // second- growth oaks and other bottomland // hardwoods grew above the waterline . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivory-bill . Who could say ? Maybe we // would wake up the next morning and find // a nest right outside of camp . We put up // our tents and dubbed the place Camp // Ephilus II , in honor of the camp Arthur // Allen set up within sight of an active // ivory-bill nest in the Singer Tract in 1935. // At dusk we fought our way back upstream // to the place we had seen the bird . // Another great old cypress , perhaps seven // feet in diameter , stood not far from // where the ivory-bill had been . We could // see at least one excellent woodpecker // hole . Could it possibly be an // ivory-billed woodpecker 's roost hole ? Or // maybe it was a nest . Anything seemed // possible and perhaps even probable to us // that day . We sat silently tucked away at // the side of the bayou , waiting for a // bird to fly into the hole or make a kent // call or a double rap . In the quiet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we // watched and waited for over an hour . // Nothing showed up . When it was too dark // to see , we headed back to camp , shining // our tiny flashlight beams into the abyss // of darkness ahead . Gene had hung little // strips of white toilet paper on branches // to mark the way , and we followed them in // the darkness like Hansel and Gretel . //
