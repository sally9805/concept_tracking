Chapter One Lair Conversation Imagine-if you dare-the most hideous , spine-tingling music-screeching violins and long , ominous bass notes that shake the ground . A cacophony of horror is perfect for the scene we are about to describe . For in the darkness of a pungent room , though high and far from what we call earth , sits a being so revolting and gruesome that some have wished we would leave him out of our story . They urge us to shy away from scenes like this , but what would a story be without a villain ? How could we measure the good of one character unless we compared it to the bad of another ? Without the being before us , we would not understand the meaning of putrid , malevolent , wicked , or even appalling . No , here lies the very heart of our tale , for it is our hero 's duty to defeat this foe , to utterly cleanse the world ( both the visible and the invisible ) of this powerful beast . At the moment , all we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twitching tail . His head bobs at something . Is he eating the flesh of an enemy ? Might he be devouring our hero even now ? Or picking meat from the bones of some trusted friend of our hero ? Or more awful still , could he betorturing someone , trying to pry the whereabouts of our hero from him or her ? As we move into the lantern light in the corner , we clearly see the Dragon 's pointed ears encrusted with wax , his long snout with nostrils dripping a gelatinous green substance . The Dragon sniffs it back , and the tongue darts in and out . The moving lips reveal stained , jagged teeth that could snap you in two . Reptilian eyes with dark slits in the centers glow with what seems like fascination or anticipation . And the massive jaw is working . The body exudes evil power , and it is all we can do to stay in his presence-but stay we must . For he is not chewing or singing or talking to himself or doing anything superfluous . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can truly comprehend , as they are written for someone with a heart , with compassion . The Dragon shudders and mutters , " The Son , the Son , the Son . That 's all you write about , is n't it ? " He clears his throat , and a squeak of fire escapes but does not damage the book . " ' The Son shall have power and dominion ' ? " he chortles . " No . Your prophecies will not come true , for your Son is gone , a coward cowering in some corner . He will never be all you want him to be . " The Dragon snarls at a knock behind him and flips another page with a sharpened talon , trying in vain to tear a hole in the book . " What is it ? " Enter RHM , Reginald Handler Mephistopheles ( or right-hand man , if you prefer ) , who would usurp this stinky throne if he could . The two converse in hushed tones , the gist of the vile talk and innuendo concerning our hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ! " RHM bows his head . " Somehow he defeated your demon vipers and eluded you . But we still have the book- " " He is getting stronger , " the Dragon roars , caring nothing for letting his underling finish a sentence . " Each time he eludes us he becomes more confident . " " Not so strong that he could defeat you , sire . " " Of course not . But if he comes to believe he can defeat me , he can harm our plan , all we 've worked so hard to accomplish , all we mean to destroy . " The Dragon turns back to the book . " These words speak of a new day , countering the rise of my kingdom . They suggest a model of the world under the Son 's rule . " " Such words would instill a false hope in the people , " RHM says . " That is why you have so wisely kept words from them . " " The fact is , he found this . The Wormling read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read far enough to breach the portal ; we know that . It 's to our advantage that the Son has no idea who he is . " " He ca n't be far from the castle , " RHM says . He draws a circle on an aged map on the wall . " We think he is somewhere within this area , but this Watcher of his alerts him to our flyers , and the tracking device- " " Has been destroyed . I know . " The Dragon flips to the back of the book , brow furrowed as if struggling to grasp the meaning . " It says here- " he taps the page- " that their world will be cleansed by fire . " " Your plan all along , sire . " " Yes , " he purrs . " Truly perfect . They will welcome this cleansing as for their own good , and we will strike them down . " He turns a furtive eye toward his underling . " It also says that these beings are vulnerable to temptation . " RHM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Dragon growls , and something flashes in his eyes . " Bring the Changeling . I have an important mission for him . " (
