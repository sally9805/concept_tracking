The " two-horned grotesque monster , " the " devil in disguise . " Not the talk you expect to hear about the Pope from your parish priest . Not unless you 're in Greece , where Christian Orthodox clergy are hellbent on canceling POPE JOHN PAUL II 's first papal visit next week . Protests by zealots  --  who blame Roman Catholic Crusaders for sacking Constantinople , seat of the Orthodox Byzantine Empire , in 1204  --  will probably not deter John Paul when he starts a biblical pilgrimage that will continue to Syria and Malta , following in the footsteps of St. Paul . The Pope was invited by Greek President COSTIS STEPHANOPOULOS , and some believe the invitation was a jab at Archbishop Christodoulos , who recently roused demonstrators to protest state plans to scrap religious affiliation from state ID cards . Faced with possible international humiliation , Christodoulos grudgingly agreed not to block the Pope 's visit " as head of state " but ruled out a joint liturgy with John Paul . <P>  --  By Anthee Carassava/Athens       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
