No longer convinced that moms really can have it all , women like Phoebe Philo , formerly of Chlo , are trading in dream jobs for diaper duty . By Heather Hodson // When I heard rumors that Phoebe Philo , the supremely talented British fashion designer ( the one who created the posh Bohemian look embodied by Mischa Barton , Kirsten Dunst , and Sienna Miller ) , was chucking it in as creative director at French fashion house Chloe for full-time momhood , I called a fashion editor friend to find out whether it was true . This friend , who has children at home but was still in the office at 7:30 P.M. , exhaled a long , plangent sigh . " Yes , she 's off , " she replied . " It 's the eternal dilemma , is n't it ? " Opt out or pursue the climb to the top ? These days we are n't supposed to have to choose-women can have it all ! - yet more of us are doing just that . And the choice we 're making is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with her simple maternal wish to " spend more time with my new baby in the coming months , " is a growing trend among high-achieving women to turn their backs on their warp-speed workplaces to raise children full-time instead . And judging by the number of celebrities eager to attest to their new role as Stay-at-Home Mom ( for example , Gwyneth Paltrow , who has declared that she 's enjoying spending time looking after her family , husband Chris Martin and their 21-month-old daughter , Apple ) , opting out appears not just socially acceptable but chic . " It 's a forefront issue , " says fashion entrepreneur and mother of six Tory Burch , who stepped out of the workforce for three years in 1998 , when her twin sons were a year old . Her reason ? " I realized I needed to take more time with them . I did n't want to miss anything . " Says Jennifer Carlston , who had been the PR director at Louis Vuitton for two years when her son was born : " On the one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compete for these corporate jobs , but now that we 're here , we think , I 'd rather read The Very Quiet Cricket to my kid . " With no option to go part-time , Carlston " bailed , " as she puts it . Three years ago , when my first child , Sam , had just turned eight months old , I took a job as a full-time editor at Bazaar . I had separation anxiety within , oh , 10 seconds of stepping out of the elevator . You would think I might have anticipated some work/diapers conundrums , but this was my dream job , the culmination of years of grafting on British magazines and newspapers ; now I was finally here , and I was full of doubt . Was I insane ? But motherhood is like falling in love-you are not in charge of your emotions . Every day while I sat in the office , commissioning the best fashion writers in the business , my mind would wander , always to Sam , regardless of whether he was at Tumbling Tots or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance , assured me we would still eat if I left my job . I was lucky-I had a choice-but the instinct not to quit on a career that was going well was strong . Then one morning I was in the back of a yellow cab on Fifth Avenue , and the cabdriver , who saw my pained face as I waved Sam off in his Bugaboo stroller , began lecturing me on the fleeting nature of childhood and why middle-class children are better off in Bombay-Bombay , for heavens sake-than in New York City , where so many women , never see their kids between Monday morning and Friday night . The evening before , Sam 's fat toddler legs had buckled on our parquet floor , yet even as I rushed to him , the first name he cried out for was not mine but his nanny 's . Gut turning to ice does n't quite convey the feeling . Two weeks later I resigned . Maternal guilt has a habit of compelling women to sprint to personnel with the resignation letrter . Crystal Lourd loved her job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born . But when her second child was six months old , a work trip to Paris as the West Coast PR consultant for Dior gave her pause . " I was nursing , and I got mastitis because my electric breast pump would n't work with the French electricity . " She rethought her priorities . And several weeks later , while preparing to outfit celebrities for an upcoming red-carpet event , she thought , " Wait a minute-my child 's crying . I really do n't care if this actress is going to wear this dress ! " Soon after she resigned . For Lisa Kilby , who left her 60-hour-a-week job as vice president in the global-services division at JP Morgan just berore her first child turned a year old , the fact that her weekends were spent grocery shopping instead of playing with her daughter convinced her to leave . " My daughter was more attached to her nanny than she was to me , " Kilby recalls . " If I 'd stayed at the bank , I could have worked superhard and maybe even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a bunch of money yet would never have known my kids . " Kilby and Philo are part of a generation of post-baby boomers , born between 1965 and the early 1970s , for whom the model of a full-time working supermom , blazing through the boardrooms while handling a variety of domestic appliances , does n't quite do it . The women Kilby saw on Wall Street who 'd risen in the ' ' 80s and stayed the course were the first generation of working girls for whom most of the barriers were broken down . Many of them either did n't have kids or , if they did , never saw them . This made her decision to go home a no-brainer . " I really did n't see anybody in between as a role model . When I started thinking , " Where am I going ? What do I have to give up to get there ? ' that turned me off . " Of course , there are women who balance both work and motherhood , but often they are women who have had favorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three children while helping to rejuvenate the family business and make it the hip label it is today . " My generation of women was the first to have their children late , but I had the luck to have them young , " she explains . She was also blessed by the Missoni factory 's being minutes from her home . " The factory was like my house . After school my children would come see me and do their homework at the atelier . " There is a third option , however , beyond the Stay at Home and the Keep On Going : choosing full-time motherhood when your children are young and not planning on a permanent departure from the workplace . This can lead to even greater career success . Stylish mother of four Brooke de Ocampo , who left her high-powered job in the clientadvisory department at Sotheby 's just before her first daughter was born ( with twin daughters arriving 15 months later ) , recalls having a lightbulb moment during her children 's nap time . It led to her much-talked-about book Bright Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and it gives you a new window that maybe you would n't have had otherwise . " Likewise Tory Burch , who came up with her eponymous fashion and lifestyle line after she left Narciso Rodriguez to become a full-time mother . " I did n't sleep for literally four years with the twins . I spent a lot of time butping them and thinking about the idea for my line . " Phoebe Philo may find comfort in these women 's triumphs . She is rumored to want to spend the next decade bringing up children and then return to fashion . Industry insiders are already speculating on the kind of capsule collection she will create . " She 's a very young woman , " says Diane von Furstenberg , who chose to continue building her fashion empire while raising two children . " None of this means that in five years ' time she wo n't do it again .
