All this , " said Wayne the plumber , " was written down in the Bible five thousand years ago . " He was out on the deck taking a break from doing angioplasty on the pipes beneath my kitchen sink . Meanwhile , he was giving his assistant , John Pickles , a lesson . <p> " Hey , Wayne " I yelled from an upstairs window , " you 're wrong about the date . Most of the events in the Bible did n't even take place five thousand years ago . Solomon , for example , in all his glory , at best got going about three thousand years ago , and nobody wrote the diary of his activities until at least a century later . " <p> I should n't have got involved . But why not ? I was desperate to get in on a theological discussion , especially with Wayne . Wayne was a plumber , all right , but he was also a missionary in Ecuador . He returned to the States one year out of every five and ran the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broken and burst pipes of the bourgeoisie . After that it was back to church in the poor places outside Quito , where conversion was his calling . <p> " Be that as it may , " Wayne shouted back , " I 'd have to see some evidence . " <p> Ah , evidence ! I had n't been subscribing to Biblical Archeological Review for nothing-although it was almost nothing given the generous terms of their initial subscription rate . But evidence is a paltry thing compared to passion , and this , I knew , was where Wayne would have me by the U-bolt . <p> It , and by " it " I mean my desperation , had begun quietly enough on a soft summer day in the first year of the new millennium C.E. ( I 'm being careful here ) . The traffic on Route 9 outside the Chestnut Hill Mall congested and fumed , but the SUV in front of me presented a hopeful bumper sticker very much in favor of Jesus . It had been a long time since I had really thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my people in the few but noisy and concentrated places that we occupied in the vast world , I had never given him a fair shake . <p> So I shook . In the historical , evidentiary direction , of course . It turned out from my excursion to the Newton Public Library , section 801.3 , that Jesus was n't just Jewish , he was really Jewish . Not only did he have no idea he was a Christian , he never imagined that he might become one . In addition , if I could work up the courage , I had some news to break to Wayne , and it was earthshattering . According to the two most eminent professors of Jewish Jesus , " son of God " was an Aramaic figure of speech . Digest that ! It meant nothing more and nothing less than " pious dude . " It was n't at all uncommon on the dusty streets outside Jerusalem for young studs to greet one other in the swish tongue of the day , with a friendly " Hey , son of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had known for some time how dangerous inspired language could be to the literal-minded . For example , my own lot , the Jews . Who told us to strap a little black box with a prayer inside onto our heads once a day ? Answer : no one . " And ye shall bind these words upon your forehead " clearly meant " Remember them . But no , a hundred years pass , and someone dreams up the apparatus . Soon enough he 's got a business going , and the leather guy is happy , so who wants to interfere with at least two men 's livelihoods ? <p> I was trying not to interfere with Wayne 's , but there was no turning back . After a quick refresher read-up in The Changing Face of Jesus by Gezer Vermes , pp. 12-25 , I went down into the kitchen . <p> " Okay , " I said , " how do you explain this ? The Book of John says that the Last Supper took place on the day before the Passover Seder , but the Synoptic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , I know what they are , " Wayne said . He was patient with me . <p> " Well , they date it on the day of the Seder . You see what I 'm saying . They ca n't both be right . " <p> Wayne had his head under the sink . His legs were sticking out . <p> " John- " He was trying hard to project his voice , but I lost the rest of his sentence . <p> " It 's impossible , you see , " I continued , " that the Jews could have held a court hearing the following day , on Passover itself . <p> That was against the rules . So John must have got it wrong . ' <p> Wayne slid his pear-shaped body out from under the sink . His blond hair was flattened . He looked a little like Yogi Bear . <p> " The rules ? Impossible ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Well , did n't you ever hear of rules being broken ? " <p> He had a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to know what had gone down between pink dawn and rosy dusk on consecutive days two thousand years ago . I 'd probably have to go back to the library . <p> " All I know , " Wayne said , " is that we could do with someone like Jesus now . " <p> He stood up . He was a head taller than me , and he had a wrench in his hand . <p> I decided to leave the son of God issue until after he 'd fixed the pipes . <p> Wayne dropped the wrench into his toolbox . " Are you , " he asked , " by any chance a connoisseur of the ancient languages ? " <p> " I know a little Italian , " I replied . Wayne knew I was kidding . <p> " The Hebrew Aleph , " he went on ; " is a pictorial symbol of the shift from a hunting to an agrarian culture . The letter is made up of a bull 's horns and a broken ring . The taming of the bull , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from my house in the village of Pifo who has a brass ring in his nose . I call him Aleph . " <p> " That 's fascinating , " I said . " So you do n't believe that Hebrew is a holy tongue ? " <p> " I believe in the Holy tongue of fire that is Our Lord Jesus Christ ! <p> " When do you think you 'll be done with the sink ? " I asked . <p> " This job , " Wayne said , " is quite complicated . It looks as if someone has been shoving Q-tips and rice down the waste disposal . It could take all day to unblock . " <p> It was dinnertime . My wife , Claire , and I were eating pad thai ordered in from Jamjuri . My son , Nick , had his own hamster food , three lettuce leaves and a crouton . He was starving himself in order to make weight for his first varsity high school wrestling match . <p> " Did you know ? " I began , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wayne been round again ? " my wife interrupted . " I thought he was back in Ecuador . " <p> " Next month . He returns next month . " <p> " Maybe you should go with him . " <p> She had been harsh with me for two days , ever since she had overheard me on the phone telling a friend that I was in love with Helen Hunt . At the time she 'd got off a scathing " Yeah , like she 's gon na call you . " I thought that was the end of the matter , but it turned out it was just the beginning . <p> My son looked up from his leaves . <p> " Temptation Island tonight " he said . <p> " Disgusting , " my wife responded . " You 're just like your father . <p> And do n't you watch anything other than Fox ? " <p> " Yes , " he replied , " I watch Cribs , and sometimes there 's stuff on WB . " <p> I was thinking hard about the historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aleph I did n't want to broach the subject in conversation . <p> The festival of Hanukkah was approaching , with its lovely candlelights not to be used for utilitarian purposes . I could have mentioned this at the dinner table , but that was to risk sounding like a religious fanatic , when in fact I was merely a sentimentalist and eclectic reader with too much time on his hands . Wrestling seemed safe . <p> " What weight are you going at ? " I asked Nick . <p> " One seventy . " <p> " And what do you weigh now ? " <p> " One seventy-five . " <p> He had the crouton speared on the end of his fork . <p> " Do n't you think , " he said , " that your friend Paul Vogel looks exactly like Osama bin Laden ? " <p> It was true , but Paul Vogel also looked like Kobe Bryant and Scottie Pippen . And a little kid in New York City had once approached him on a bus and asked if he was Jesus . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the pad thai while avoiding the noodles . <p> " According to the most unimpeachable sources , " I ventured , " Jesus was probably a Galilean Hasid , a pious wanderer , a miracle worker from out of the cold North . " <p> There was silence in the room , only the fridge muttered something in reply , buzzed up probably by my Nordic reference . <p> Eventually Claire said : " I 'm sure it 's hot in the Galilee , most of the time , anyway . " <p> I 'd expected this blow to fall , but anticipation did n't help to reduce its impact . These were serious times , and there was no excuse at all for flights of fancy in the service of a decent sentence . <p> " Are you going to come and watch ? " Nick asked . <p> " When 's the meet ? " <p> " Wednesday night . " <p> " I 'll be there " I said . <p> It was n't like I had anything else to do . I was recuperating from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gall bladder , which had decided to swell to bursting point , then spit tiny stones into the narrow channel that rushed deliveries to my liver , creating a blockage that not even Wayne could have foreseen . <p> The phone rang . <p> " You get it , " my wife said . <p> It was Paul Vogel calling from San Francisco . <p> " Hey , " I said , " we were just talking about you . The uncanny resemblance . ' <p> " Tell me about it " he replied . " I ca n't go out of the house . Half the neighborhood thinks I want to blow up the Golden Gate Bridge : ' " <p> " Did you think about shaving off your beard ? " <p> " What are you , the Taliban ? This is a free country . You can micromanage your own facial hair . " <p> " You 're right " I said . " That 's the beauty of America . " <p> We talked for a while about my scar , which was less a scar than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was thirty and a newlywed . <p> " They pulled the gangrenous gall bladder out through my navel , " I said . <p> " Helen might like to know that , " my wife put in without looking up from her plate . <p> The crowd around the wrestling mat was standing-room-only . <p> The bout in progress offered an uncontroversial intergender affair , for these are open prairie days in the wide United States such as the world has never known . A boy in the 19o lb. range had spread his arms to circle the girth of his female twin . As the view cleared before me , he threw her to the ground and began to twist her arm . Somehow , Atlas rose , lifted her rival up on her back , and shunted him all the way to the perimeter . " Good job , Teresa ! " the man next to me shouted . He was wearing a T-shirt that had the words Hombres de Acero printed above the yellow and black logo of the Pittsburgh Steelers . Teresa 's parents , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience from our side cheered wildly . The wrestlers untangled , returned to the middle of the circle , and began to grab at each other again . <p> " It 's like watching a marriage , is n't it ? " said a skinny dad on my left whom I knew to be a recent divorce . <p> " Or Jacob wrestling with the angel , " I responded , but my interlocutor pretended that he had n't heard me , and I looked away as if I had n't spoken . <p> Okay , so it was n't only Jesus . Thoughts on religious matters were leeching onto my brain at an appalling rate , and this had been the case ever since my early dismissal from the hospital on the dual grounds of my body 's good behavior and pressure from Managed Care . <p> I lie . The trouble had begun even earlier , in the brown , unhappy hour before surgery . There I was half-asleep in the arms of Morpheus when my long-dead father stretched out his arm and clapped a silky yarmulke onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glad , in a worst-case scenario , to meet my maker in the proper attire . Ten minutes later I was less appreciative when Norma , my still-living mother-in-law , showed up in the doorway of my hospital room . " ' Go in with a smile , come out with a smile ; that 's what my aunt Dixie used to say , " she said . Five milligrams of morphine performed the work that twenty years of therapy had failed to accomplish : " Go away , " I replied . <p> Back on the mat Teresa had pinned her man , his glistening hands flapped like fish on the hook and then went quiet : general uproar , the upspring of solid Teresa , slower rise of defeated opponent , quickly followed by a civilized handshake . It is finished . O strapping 190 lb. women of America , we who are about to die , salute you ! <p> Next up was Nick , whose opponent held him in a headlock for what felt like an hour . How much neck twisting can a boy take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way toward the exit , the relentless gym lights shone on his bald spot , or perhaps the light emanated from his head . I could n't tell . When I looked back Nick 's noggin was still on his shoulders , and he was lifting one of his opponent 's legs in such a way that the boy was forced to hop backwards before crashing to the ground . <p> The ground . The muddy ground , so different from heaven with its whizzing planets , icy comets , and cold-hearted angels . We were watching the New England Patriots fight for a playoff spot . The TV , suicidally beautiful , was lit with the glow of fading December . Miami lined up . There was a minute to go . <p> " Do n't worry , " Nick said . " No team ever retrieves its own onside kick . " <p> " Jesus Christ , " I yelled . " Now you 've jinxed them . " <p> " No , " he said . " You jinxed them in the third quarter when you forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' <p> The kick bounced up , and Fred Coleman hugged the ball . He sustained an enormous hit but did n't let go . <p> " Double jinx , " I said joyously . " It 's like two minuses making a plus . " <p> It was almost impossible to rid oneself of superstition , much harder than to break with God , whose behavior over the centuries had been truly unfathomable ( what was He thinking ? ) , and now , on account of 9/11 , the entire nation was crossing its fingers every time it crossed the street . That was an irony , of course , that even Wayne might have appreciated . The Fundamentalists had returned us to fundamentals . <p> " It 's mainly Christian , you know , " I said to Nick . <p> " What is ? " <p> The Patriots were hugging and smacking each other all over the field . <p> " Our superstitions : unlucky 13 , the apostles at the Last Supper ; touch wood , fingering a piece of the cross ; do n't walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cross . " <p> " Oh , yeah . " Nick twisted in his seat . <p> " Then there are the Jews with their spitting and evil eyes , and the blue lintels on Arab doorways to ward off trouble . Now bad things come in threes ' is a different story . It 's trench talk : strike a match and the enemy sees , light your cigarette and he takes aim , first puff and you 're smoke . " <p> " Hey , Mom ! " Nick called out . " Dad 's lecturing . " <p> At Foxborough Stadium the lights burned blue and yellow . A good number of the Patriots players pointed skywards and then clapped their hands to their hearts as a way of thanking God , who had helped them to victory while , in His picky way , choosing to send their opponents to ignominious defeat . It was axiomatic that in America for the last two decades at least , God , like everyone else , had developed a consuming interest in the worlds of sports and entertainment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't seem to like losers much , and they never thanked him . <p> The TV went to commercial , there was a fireman 's helmet and then a flag and then the name of an insurance company . The insurance company had decided to show the helmet and the flag against a background of stirring music . My wife had a claim logged against this particular company on account of travel plans that she had canceled in order to better nurse Nick in his summer of mononucleosis eighteen months ago . She had taken out the policy to cover her fare , but the company was quite sure that Nick had a " preexisting condition " and did n't feel inclined to pay up . We were appealing . <p> Nick clicked the remote , and the screen went blank . The world was rocking off its axis . In order to help steady it , at least in the narrow confines of our TV room , I turned to the grounding subject of love . <p> " What happened , " I asked Nick , " to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pierced eyebrow ? " <p> " Kiss and dismiss , " he replied . <p> A passenger jet , its engines screaming , passed over the house on its way into Logan . I thought I might step outside and put a little lamb 's blood on the lintel of the front door , but in the end I decided that , come spring , I would buy a ladder and begin to paint the house blue . <p> Author Affiliation
