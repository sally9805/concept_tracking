Kathleen Welch owned a cat named Mr. Grammelspacker . An absurd name ? Certainly , and when asked the reason for it , Kathleen never could give a sensible answer . But when the cat had been just a kitten , round and funny and mischievous , Cornelia , Kathleen@s grown-up sister , had called it Mr. Grammelspacker . Somehow the title stuck . Well , he was a charming pet and beautiful , too , with thick , silky fur , blacker than the blackest night , and eyes a clear and shining green . He went in and out of the house by day , and slept in a convertible , screened box in the garage . He followed his little mistress about faithfully , and at the slightest chance jumped into her lap and napped , purring . Kathleen loved him . Imagine then , how she felt when Mr. Grammelspacker disappeared . Indeed , the entire household was upset-he had been a general favorite-and for more than a week , before hope of his return was given up , much time and effort was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of milk was placed at the door , and much time was spent by the children wandering up and down the neighborhood , calling his name . But this , it seemed , was only the beginning of the tragedy . One sunshiny morning , Kathleen , in her prowling , came upon the body of a black cat stretched lifeless beneath the rose arbor . Her tears overflowed . She called Jack and Tom and even Cornelia . Together they mourned the loss of their darling . The younger children were comforted to some extent by the splendid funeral they arranged . Jack dug a grave under the lilacs ; Tom plucked quantities of garden flowers ; Aleck Hoyt , who lived across the street , lent his wagon to be the hearse on which the mortal remains of Mr. Grammelspacker were borne solemnly to their final rest . Kathleen went to the funeral wearing Cornelia 's dress and new black hat . She made an imposing figure , but left rather hurriedly , having spied her sister turning in at the gate . It was just as well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions about the borrowed finery ? . Mr. Grammelspacker was not soon forgotten . No , and that was why Kathleen heard with amazement the mewing sounds which floated up to her window late that night . She scrambled from bed and peered out . Across the lawn streaked a huge shadowy something , blotted from sight immediately by the shrubbery . She waited , but the shadow did not reappear . Until the next night-then she was roused again by that mewing , a voice so like that of the dear@ departed Mr. Grammelspacker ! She rushed to the window , calling softly , " Kitty , kitty . " And yes-a cat was there , sliding away into the bushes . The following morning , Kathleen visited Mr. Grammelspacker 's grave . The little mound was undisturbed . The flowers had wilted ; she brought fresh posies . She went to the garage , too , and shook up the cushions in the screened box , smoothing them until they had n't a single wrinkle . But there were wrinkles in Kathleen 's forehead ; she was puzzled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had the queerest dream last night . I thought Mr. Grammelspacker came alive and perched on my window sill . " He frowned . " The odd part is , when I awoke there was a cat on the sill . The instant I spoke , it darted away . " Kathleen shivered . " His ghost ! " she whispered . " I 've seen it , too . " Jack was far too wise to believe in ghosts . When Mother was consulted , she said there must be another black cat nearby rather like their dead pet . But the children doubted this-had there ever been another cat like Mr. Grammelspacker ? Well , Mother had to admit she had never seen one so large and beautiful . " It 's a mystery , " stated Jack . " I like mysteries , do n't you ? " " Not , " answered Kathleen , " when they concern a member of my own family . " The mystery deepened . Now somebody-or something-began to sleep in Mr. Grammelspacker 's bed ! Each evening , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrange his cushions . Each morning , the bed was rumpled , showing beyond any doubt the imprint of a bulky body . There were ten days of this ; then one morning , she walked into the garage and found the bed occupied . Curled upon the cushions lay a huge black cat . For a long minute Kathleen stared ; she tiptoed to the other side and all around . Then with a shriek she ran out into the yard . " He 's here ! " she shouted . Jack and Tom were playing marbles with Aleck Hoyt . They sprang to their feet . " Who is here ? " Tom demanded . " Mr. Grammelspacker ! " Jack shook his head and said , " Kathleen , you know Mr. Grammelspacker is in his grave . " Nothing of the sort . He 's right here in his own box this minute ! " Kathleen laughed and clapped her hands . " And he is n't alone , either . " I suppose , " said Jack with dignity , " his ghost is with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed her into the garage , and , as they bent over the box , burst into excited speech . Indeed Mr. Grammelspacker was not alone ! Close by his side were six kittens , tiny and fat and clothed in suits of shining black fur . Jack stopped and made a detailed examination . " Yes , " he said , " it 's Mr. Grammelspacker , no doubt about it . " " You mean Mrs. Grammelspacker , " corrected Aleck Hoyt . " I mean our own cat . See , his neat white necktie-and the tip of his tail is missing , the tip he caught in a mousetrap when he was a baby . " " You mean her white necktie , the tip of her tail . But what about the other cat , the one we buried ? " " I thought it was Mr. Grammelspacker . I could have sworn it was . " " Evidently a case of mistaken identity , " said Aleck , importantly . Kathleen sat down on the floor and gathered the big cat into her lap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've deceived us . Yes , and you@ve caused us a lot of sorrow and worry . But you are sweet-and your children are sweet , too . And I shall always love you  --  all of you ! " The cat opened clear green eyes , yawned , and stretched forth an important pink tongue . " There are some questions I 'd like to ask you , " continued Kathleen , " about why you acted so strangely , and where you have been all these weeks . And about the other cat . Oh , I 'm glad we gave him a decent funeral . But who was he ? If you do n't tell us , Mr.-Mrs . Grammelspacker , I am afraid that we will never know ! " // <p>
