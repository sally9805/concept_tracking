1 <p> Snow and sleet were swirling in all directions as Regan Reilly steered her car onto the lower level of the Fifty-ninth Street Bridge in Manhattan , headed for Long Island City . This might not have been the best day to get ambitious about moving old files to a storage unit , she thought . The early morning had been cold and gray , with threatening skies and a prediction of what forecasters liked to call a " wintry mix " for later in the day . It was n't even noon yet and the storm had arrived . It would have been a good time to hunker down indoors with a cup of tea or a mug of hot chocolate . But Regan was proud of herself for getting this far . <p> Ever since Regan had moved east from Los Angeles to marry Jack " no relation " Reilly , head of the NYPD Major Case Squad , her mother , Nora , had been asking politely , yet with increasing frequency , what Regan was going to do with all the things she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the bad weather is hitting us , " Nora had said the other day , " we 'd like to be able to park both our cars inside . " <p> " Okay , Mom , I 'll take care of it , " Regan had said , somewhat daunted by the thought of figuring out what to do with the remains of her life in Los Angeles . A private investigator , Regan still missed the small office that she rented in an old building in Hollywood . When she first walked in there , it had reminded her of the office building where her grandmother had worked on West Fifty-seventh Street in New York City . Black and white tiles on the floor dating from the year one , dark wood molding in the hallways , doors with thick , foggy glass , the feeling of a place from another era . Even its smell was familiar and comforting . Regan had been intrigued . She had the sense that the old walls held the stories and secrets of the people who had worked there over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in tales of any sort . It was part of her genetic makeup . With thoughts of her grandmother , she 'd signed the lease and never looked back . <p> But when it was time to leave , for what was a wonderful change in her life , she could n't bear to part with her scarred old desk , her one-of-a-kind funky floor lamp , which she 'd found at a yard sale at an old estate in Beverly Hills , and her battered file cabinets that the former tenant of the office left behind . To her they had a certain charm and would always bring back memories of her salad days as a PI . Among other things she kept was the thermos that she 'd brought to work every day , filled with coffee . None of it belonged in Regan and Jack 's newly renovated loft in Tribeca , where she had a home office replete with a custom-made cherrywood desk and matching wall-to-ceiling bookshelves , but to forsake these earthly possessions seemed impossible . They were like old friends . <p> " Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your western office , " her father , Luke , owner of three funeral homes , had joked . " If you ever become president , we can turn it into a museum and charge admission . " <p> " Dad , believe it or not , I have a sentimental streak . " <p> " So did the Collyer brothers , " Luke remarked , referring to the brothers who lived in a brownstone on Fifth Avenue in New York City and became infamous after they died in 1947 thanks to their stunning inability to throw anything away . When the police received an anonymous tip that there was the smell of a dead body emanating from the residence , they tried to enter the house through the front door but were blocked by a wall of old newspapers , boxes , and piles of junk that you 'd find on a street corner waiting to be taken to the local dump . A patrolman entered through a second-story window and found the body of Homer Collyer . It was presumed that his brother , Langley , had skipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weeks working to clear out the more than one hundred tons of rubbish from the residence was Langley 's body discovered , just ten feet away from where his brother had been found , hidden under a pile of newspapers . After that any mention of the Collyer brothers brought to mind one heck of a mess . They even had a syndrome named after them . <p> Regan ignored her father 's quip . " Living in the city , Jack and I do n't have a basement or attic so I have no place to put this stuff . " <p> " Thank God , " Jack had joked . <p> Now all three of them were away . Her parents were in Palm Beach , Florida , and Jack had left yesterday for a law enforcement seminar in Miami . I 'll show them , Regan had thought early this morning . She had n't slept well . It was the first night Jack was away since they had been married . Funny how things change , Regan had thought . I was single until I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 'm with Jack , I feel out of sorts when he 's not around . How easily one gets accustomed to a good thing . <p> After Regan crossed the bridge , she turned left on Northern Boulevard , and stopped at the light . She 'd been down this road three hours ago after looking in the yellow pages and calling several storage companies . At Store Your Stuff they had a special deal on an available unit that was the right size and climate controlled . Regan had checked it out , filled out the necessary paperwork , then been fingerprinted . <p> " We do n't want to do business with anyone who wo n't give us thumbs up , " the receptionist had joked . " There 's always a creep or two who 'll want to use our facilities to hide ill-gotten gains . " <p> " I can imagine , " Regan had replied , thinking she should leave them her card . She 'd then driven to New Jersey , loaded up her car with boxes and files , and headed back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ van and get someone to help her load the unwieldy items like the desk and the lamp . Her mother was going to be so shocked when she returned from Florida . <p> When the light changed , Regan started to drive , passing a stretch of industrial buildings . A subway train went speeding by on the tracks above the road . After a few blocks the big sign atop Store Your Stuff ' s warehouse beckoned her . Here we go , Regan thought as she turned down a dead-end side street just past the sign , backed her car into the loading area , wheeled a cart up to her trunk , and started to unload . When she was finished , she pulled her car back out onto the dead end in case someone else with a Collyer brothers streak needed the space to drop off whatever junk it was they could n't part with . Twenty minutes later , having deposited her precious cargo on the floor of her newly acquired rental property , and padlocking the door with a brand-new lock , Regan was stepping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred bucks a month , she thought as pelts of what was certainly a wintry mix stung her face . She pulled her keys out of her pocket and hurried to the car . Her cell phone began to ring as she was opening the driver 's door . She reached in her pocket again , grabbed the phone , and glanced at the caller ID . From the area code she could tell it was a Los Angeles number . <p> " Hello , " Regan said as she gratefully sank behind the wheel and turned on the ignition . <p> " Regan , it 's Abigail ! " <p> " Abigail , how are you ? " It was a question Regan was almost afraid to ask . A former neighbor , Abigail Feeney had moved into the apartment across the hall from Regan in a building in the Hollywood Hills not long before Regan moved back to New York . A hairdresser who worked in film and television , Abigail believed she 'd been cursed since birth . Not only was she born on Friday the thirteenth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined with Feeney , added up to thirteen letters . In Abigail 's book that was a bad start . Since then she 'd had her share of unlucky things happen to her , including breaking her leg in the eighth grade just before a class trip , graduation , and all the swim parties . In high school she came down with the chicken pox right before her prom . As an adult she 'd been unlucky in love more times than she liked to count . Shortly before Regan moved to New York , Abigail had met a guy she really liked . A guy that Regan instinctively did n't trust . <p> In October , Abigail had called Regan and told her that her boyfriend , Cody , had disappeared right after she lent him one hundred thousand dollars . <p> " He signed an IOU , Regan , that said he 'd pay me back in three months . Then , a week later , I came home from work to find a note he 'd left for me . He said he had to go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a call . That was five days ago and I have n't heard a peep out of him ! And he wo n't respond to the messages I 've left on his cell phone ! " <p> " If it 's a three-month IOU , then I do n't think there 's anything you can do just yet , " Regan had told her . <p> In November , Abigail called Regan to tell her that she 'd been injured on a movie set . A piece of scaffolding fell , knocked her over , and she broke her arm in two places . " Can you believe this Regan ? I had to have surgery . They put pins in my arm . I obviously ca n't work , and the production company is acting like the accident was somehow my fault . I 'm going to have to hire a lawyer . Furthermore , I tried to get in touch with you-know-who and his cell phone is disconnected . " <p> Now it was a new year . Regan had called Abigail over the holidays but her home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cell number . She braced herself for Abigail 's answer to the state of her well-being . <p> " Regan ! The nogood bum has been spotted in downtown Los Angeles . I desperately , and I mean desperately , need the money he owes me . The IOU runs out tomorrow , January thirteenth , which just happens to be my birthday . Can you please come out here and help me track him down ? " <p> There was no need for Regan to confirm with Abigail the identity of the nogood bum . She remembered being in her apartment and seeing Cody Castle , the socalled producer , sitting by the pool , bent over his cell phone , text messaging nonstop . A good-looking guy who knew it , he was a little too impressed with himself for Regan 's taste . She had n't liked him and was quite sure that the feeling was mutual . <p> " Track him down ? " Regan asked half-heartedly as cold air blew from her dashboard . <p> " Yes ! I have to at least try . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred thousand dollars I lent him . " <p> Regan frowned , visions of loan sharks dancing in her head . " Where did you get it , Abigail ? " <p> " My grandmother ! " <p> " Your grandmother ? " <p> " Yes . From the time I turned eighteen , she 's been putting ten thousand dollars a year in an account for me . She wanted me to eventually use it for a down payment on a house or an apartment . I had every intention of doing that . But the other day she called and said she feels terrible that I had this accident and that Cody and I broke up . She 's decided she 's going to come out here and stay at her friend Margaret 's condo on Kings Road in West Hollywood . Her friend is selling the place , and if it meets with my grandmother 's approval , she 's going to buy it for me . With cash ! That cash is supposed to include that one hundred thousand dollars ! If she ever finds out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do mean scrimped and saved , she 'll kill me ! " <p> A loan shark suddenly does n't sound so bad , Regan thought . " When is she coming out ? " <p> " Tomorrow . For my birthday ! She 's flying out from Indiana . I tried to stall her but she 's already bought her ticket . I have to find him , Regan . I have to get my money back ! " <p> Regan 's feet were frozen , her nose was red , and Jack was out of town . Abigail had been awfully nice to her last winter when she had the flu , bringing her homemade chicken soup . Regan thought of her own grandmother and how hard she 'd worked . I would never have wanted to face her if I 'd lent one hundred thousand dollars of her money to some fly-by-night guy . " Okay , Abigail . I 'll go home and check with the airlines . The weather 's bad , but hopefully I can get a flight out tonight . " <p> " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's eighty degrees out here . " <p> " I look forward to that . Oh , Abigail , I had tried to call you in December but your home phone was disconnected . " <p> " Another disaster ! The owner of my apartment returned from her adventure overseas . She gave the required thirty days ' notice . With a broken arm I had to pack up my stuff and get out of there before Christmas . Most of my stuff is in storage . " <p> Regan blinked . Abigail and I will have a lot to talk about , she thought . " Where are you now ? " she asked . " Where will we be staying ? " <p> " I 'm looking after three different homes whose owners are away . My primary duties are watering plants and collecting the mail . Do n't worry . You 'll have a place to sleep . " <p> Terrific , Regan thought . I should have appreciated my lonely bed last night . " Okay then , Abigail . " <p> " Okay , Regan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no idea what this means to me .
