Chapter One As soon as I opened the door to the 52nd Air Refueling Squadron I knew something was off . Penny Follette held open the inner door at the top of the incline , her smile radiating like a beacon in the dim light . Penny did n't radiate . In fact , she was usually unnoticeable . " Penny , are you okay ? " I asked . " I 'm fine , " Penny said as frigid wind sliced across the back of my neck before the squadron 's outer door thudded shut . I lurched up the steep hallway to the squadron . The incline was a safety feature left over from the Cold War . The squadron , located in the old alert facility at Greenly Air Force Base in eastern Washington State , had once housed rotating shifts of aircrews ready to respond to nuclear threats . I guess the steep walkways had been designed to slow down Communists raiding the building . They certainly slowed me down . And I 'm not that fast to begin with since I lug a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snack food in a diaper bag , not to mention my twenty-month-old daughter , Livvy . I squeezed through the inner door , dropped the diaper bag and my purse , a fuchsia Belen Echandia shoulder bag I 'd snapped up from eBay , at my feet . I 'll admit it-I 'm a bagoholic . I 'm addicted to purses . They 're my one indulgence . Well , that 's not strictly true because I indulge in chocolate , too . But that 's it . Only two indulgences . My fuchsia bag provided a nice bright spot on an otherwise dreary day , just like my purses provided the only stylish accent in my typical Mommy ensemble of sweaters , sweatshirts , jeans , and snow boots . I was too tired to coordinate outfits . All I could manage right now were purses with panache . Later , maybe when Livvy went to kindergarten , I 'd try to accessorize . I shifted Livvy to my other arm . She wiggled and said , " Pen ! Pen ! " " Are you sure you 're okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She pushed her dull brown braid over her shoulder and reached for Livvy . " Hello there , little Livvy , " she murmured . Even in the dim hall , in her droopy gray sweater and sagging broomstick skirt , Penny looked luminous . " I 'm wonderful . " Her smile 's wattage edged up another notch . " The most amazing thing has happened . I 'm dying to tell you . " She sighed , " But I ca n't . I promised . " She handed Livvy back . Her petite size forced her to look up at me as she grinned mischievously . " I 'll call you this afternoon and tell you . " " Okay , " I said slowly . In the year and a half that I 'd known her , I 'd never seen Penny look mischievous . And I 'd gotten to know her pretty well since Penny and her husband , Will , another pilot in the same squadron as my husband , lived down the street from me . She was one of my most dependable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulder and pulled a small gold bag out of a webbed side pocket . A crossword puzzle book fell from the pocket to the floor . " Here . Wo n't be eating these anymore . " She shoved the gold bag at me , then picked up the book and put it away . " You take them . Then I wo n't be tempted . " The curly font on the bag read Chocolate Covered Espresso Beans . I tried to give them back . " I do n't even like coffee . You love coffee . " My hands were full enough with Livvy squirming , but I knew better than to set her down . She 'd motor away around a corner and I 'd have to chase her down . Penny continued to paw around in her bag . " I do n't want them . Throw them away if you do n't like them . " " I 'll drop them off at Mitch 's office . Someone will eat them . " Penny paused in her search of her backpack . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her face still glowed , but her brown eyes were serious . " The thing last year . " She hesitated , tucked a strand of wiry hair back into her braid . " Well . You figured it out . " I 'd been embroiled in a search for a murderer in the squadron . " I did n't really ... " I said . " Yes , you did . You knew something was wrong and did n't let it go . I think I need someone to- " The outer set of doors clanged open . Icy air gusted up the incline and snaked through the cracks under the inner doors . We shifted to make room . Penny stood on tiptoe to catch a glimpse of the flight crew laboring up the incline . Livvy went still in my arms , her attention on the heavy tread and voices that echoed up the vaultlike incline . Penny 's face shuttered . She zipped her backpack , heaved it up on her shoulder . I blinked at her abrupt change . Penny was back in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeke Peters , the pilot , led the crew . His tall figure filled the doorway as he said , " Come on . I 've got to be out of here in an hour . " The next guy , Staff Sergeant Rory Tyler , strolled through the door . " She 's not going to leave without you , " he said . His round glasses reflected the light from the hallway , and I could n't see his expression as he held the door open for the last crew member . Zeke smiled at us and strode down the hall , saying over his shoulder , " Yeah , but you do n't have to ride all the way to Seattle with her if you 're late , so get a move on . " First Lieutenant Aaron Reed , the copilot , did n't look at us , just ducked his head with his thin blond hair as he stowed his hat in the ankle pocket of his flight suit , then hurried to catch up with the other two men as they continued down the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their legs , giving them an exaggerated swagger . As she watched the departing men , I caught a change in Penny 's expression that I could n't identify , a flicker of fear or anger in her eyes ? " Are you sure you 're okay ? " I 'd never seen Penny 's mood zigzag . Her emotions were usually as straightforward as a ruler . " I 'm fine . " Penny pulled her gaze back to me . " Later ? Can we get together ? " " Sure . I 'm going to lunch with Mitch , but I 'll be home this afternoon . " With Mitch scheduled to leave in two weeks for a forty-five-day deployment to the " sandbox , " the nickname for the desert , we were trying to spend as much time together as we could . " What have you been doing today ? " I asked . " I 've been over at the Mansion interviewing General Bedford for an article about Frost Fest . " The Mansion , a large antebellum-style building complete with portico , held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're interviewing the wing commander about Frost Fest ? Is he on a committee or something ? " " No . It 's a human interest story . Bedford 's dad was stationed here in the sixties and flew B-52s . Interesting angle , from military brat to wing commander . " " What does that have to do with Frost Fest ? " I was still confused . " Every year the organizing committee tries to showcase some aspect of Vernon . Last year it was the River . This year it 's the base . The theme is ' Dreams Take Flight ' and there 's going to be an exhibit about Greenly along with an art show with local artists . I 'm putting together a press kit with human interest write-ups for the media . " Maybe her volunteer job was the source of her sudden animation ? " So you like being on the committee ? " " It 's fine . Volunteer work to keep me in touch . " She shrugged . Obviously not the source of her excitement , from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she continued . " What can I say ? Middle Eastern art archivists are not in high demand . " With Penny 's fadeaway personality it was easy to forget she held a doctorate in ancient Middle Eastern art . " At least it gives me something to put on my resume . " " And you 're teaching art appreciation , too . " " Just continuing ed , though . " Her mouth quirked down . " Not very impressive . " " Teaching is teaching , " I insisted , trying to encourage her . We 'd been over the woes of being a trailing spouse . Wonderful designation , trailing spouse . Makes spouses sound like we have a chronic disease that causes lethargy , but it meant we were trying to get a job at the new duty station . It was even harder for Penny because her skills were so specialized . " Oh ! " Her lips twitched up and her energy level zoomed up again . " I meant to tell you . Guess who showed up last week at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The wing commander 's wife ? " I transferred Livvy to my other arm and leaned in closer . " Ms. Cosmo ? Why ? " I 'd met Mrs. Bedford during a spouse orientation flight , a flight that lets the spouses go on a local sortie to see an AR , an air refueling . It was hard to think of her as Mrs. Bedford , since that name brought to mind a middle-aged matron . Clarissa Bedford was anything but matronly . When she arrived for the orientation flight she 'd glanced around , said a vague hello to everyone in the vicinity , and then commandeered one of the airline seats . She 'd tossed her brown curls over her shoulder and spent the rest of the time flicking through a Cosmo , red nails flashing each time she turned a glossy page . I could n't imagine her being interested in art appreciation . " I 'm not sure . She added late . " The wing commander 's recent marriage to a woman twenty years younger than him had generated plenty of speculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " She wants me to organize her closets . " I run a part-time organizing business , Everything In Its Place , in any spare moment I happen to catch between changing diapers . Penny said , " Wow . You 'll know all the dirt on her . Keep me updated . Well , I 'm off to call my insurance company again . They have almost as much red tape as the Air Force . " " What happened ? " " Did n't I tell you ? " Penny leaned on the bar to open the door . " Last week , someone broke into my car , stole my radio and a handful of change out of the cup holder . " " That 's awful . Where did it happen ? " " On our street . At least they did n't look in the trunk and find my backpack . I 'd hate to lose my notes and my camera . I 'll call you . Maybe stop by this afternoon . " " That would be great . " Penny lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the squadron . Thanks to the remodeling going on in base housing , our neighborhood of Windemere in the nearby city of Vernon was the most popular off-base housing site because of its small , relatively affordable bungalows and a convenient drive time to the base . Unfortunately , the multitude of detached garages tempted burglars . Stately pines and maples along with masses of mature shrubs in Windemere provided burglars with enough cover that garage break-ins were not that unusual in our neighborhood . I was glad we had one of the few houses with an attached garage . I shoved the bag of espresso beans in the diaper bag , then grabbed the diaper bag and my purse before I wound my way through the quiet halls to the Scheduling Office . As I passed the squad 's bulletin board , a short blond tornado , Lieutenant Georgia Lamar , one of the four females in the squadron , surged by me and entered the Scheduling Office a few steps ahead of me . She set her steaming gourmet coffee down , tossed her gym bag under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside her cappuccino . " I ca n't believe I got a ticket . Seventeen ! Two miles an hour over the speed limit ! How anal can you get ? " " Took the shortcut through base housing ? " Tommy Longfellow , chief of scheduling , swiveled his chair around and stretched out his long legs . " Hi , Ellie , " he said to me . " Yeah , but two miles ? " Georgia ran her fingers through her short blond curls and shrugged out of her leather flight jacket . " You got ta slow down , George . This is the military . Things change slow . " Tommy 's words were teasing , but there was an edge of seriousness to his tone . Georgia snorted and whipped her hand through the air impatiently . " Things change . The Air Force has to get with it . " I set Livvy down and she waddled over to Mitch 's office chair . Bundled in her thick winter coat , hat , and mittens , she looked like a small , pink-padded post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey , do n't I get a kiss ? " Mitch asked as he crossed the room from a metal bookcase , carrying two thick notebooks . Livvy paused long enough to give him a distracted kiss on the cheek and then went back to spinning the chair with one mitten-covered hand . In the other , she clutched a two-inch plastic figure , a girl with short red hair in pink shirt and pants . Pink Girl , Livvy called her . Livvy did n't do anything , like eat , sleep , ride in the car , or nap , without Pink Girl . " How was the vet ? " Mitch asked me . " Busy . " My ears were still ringing from the high-pitched yaps of the poodle in the waiting room . " Rex is up to date on his shots . Ready for lunch ? " " Sure . " Mitch put away the notebook and reached for his leather flight jacket . I set the espresso beans down on the tiny table beside the coffeepot and the can of Folgers coffee ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . " Here 's some espresso beans . " It 's a fact that inedible , stale food , like three-day-old donuts or hard cookies , left in any office will disappear within a day . I figured the beans would be gone in minutes , considering Georgia 's love for coffee . Georgia 's shriek overpowered my words . She turned from her little alcove by the file cabinet and removed a large framed poster that had been propped up out of view . " Very funny , guys . " The poster , a photo of a man in tight jeans clutching a dozen red roses behind his bare back , focused on the man 's butt . Georgia twisted it around and put it against the wall . " You guys are gon na get me in trouble . Colonel Briman said I had to get it out of here . " " Then why were you so intent to get it up on the wall in the Hole ? " Tommy asked with a wide grin . The Hole was the basement break room . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding beer cans . Georgia rolled her electric-blue eyes . " Briman ordered me to get rid of it . " Mitch had Livvy in the chair now and was spinning her around . Her giggles had his full attention . Tommy leaned back even farther in his chair . " I do n't know why you 're so spun up . They 're just a bunch of pictures . " " They 're smut . Soft-core porn . Why should I have to look at them ? " Georgia turned to me , a female ally , and explained , " I wanted to take down everything , but Briman would n't buy that . Tradition ! So I figured , fair 's fair . The women in the squad should have something in there to look at , too . " " I do n't know , George . McClintock does n't seem to mind looking at those women a bit . " McClintock , an angular no-nonsense sergeant , worked in Life Support . Rumors said she had a female lover , but no one knew for sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't telling . Georgia looked at me for support . I said , " I vote for smut . " I would n't want to work in an office with photos of bikini-clad women on the break room walls . I feel guilty enough about not working out as it is . The intercom crackled and a voice announced , " Aten-shun ! " As everyone in the office stood , I glanced at Mitch . " DVs , " he muttered . " I forgot . " Livvy made a dash for the door . Great . Distinguished Visitors were in the squadron and I 'd brought our high-energy almost-two-year-old . A real career-enhancing move for Mitch . I scooped Livvy into my arms at the office 's threshold and looked back at Mitch . He suppressed a smile as he and everyone else stood at attention . Oh well , if Mitch had remembered DVs were visiting , he would 've met me at the car . I stood still and hoped my quietness would transition to Livvy . She squirmed , then noticed the stillness of the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew I 'd seen earlier was caught in the hall and stood against the wall with their posture sharp and gazes fixed in middle distance , except for Rory . He adjusted his round glasses and checked his cell phone . His stance was sloppy . They made an interesting group with the two shorter men , Rory and Aaron bracketing Zeke , who was over six feet tall . Rory and Aaron both were shorter and had blond hair , but everything about Rory was plump and robust from his barrel chest to his thick , wavy gold hair . Aaron , on the other hand , with his skinny build , beige hair , and narrow face , looked reedy and water-colored as he stood stiffly at attention . Zeke seemed poised to sprint out of there when they gave the all-clear , Rory slouched lazily , and Aaron stood so stiffly he looked like he was carved from marble . An entourage strode down the hall with an older craggy-faced man in the lead . A group of people , their shoulders liberally sprinkled with eagles and stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered something to Zeke as the DVs passed and Zeke fought to keep a straight face until the DVs entered the Orderly Room .
