Section : SERVICE REPORT Sure , you have more service choices , but rate plans are maddening and costs are soaring . Here 's how to avoid overpaying <p> It 's been four years since Congress passed the landmark Telecommunications Act of 1996 . U.S. consumers are using phone services in ways that were once unimaginable - and paying budget-busting monthly phone bills that often defy comprehension . Households that managed to make do for years with a couple of Princess handsets now bristle with cellular and cordless phones , extra land lines , pagers , high-speed Internet access , and a host of other calling services . Depending on where you live , you can now buy your local phone service from a long-distance company , your long-distance service from an Internet provider , and your Internet access from a cable company . Not surprisingly , consumers are ringing up bigger phone bills - but that 's true even though most people are n't talking more . In 1998 , the last full year for which data are available , Americans spent $246 billion on phone services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the law of the land . The average household now runs up about $70 a month in phone charges . For families with two phone lines , high-speed Internet service , a couple of cell phones , and a well-used calling card or two , the monthly cost of staying connected can easily be as expensive as a car payment . <p> Someday soon , the telecom companies and federal regulators promise , phone services will be easier to shop for and a bargain to boot . Consumers will be able to buy bundled services of broadband two-way voice , data , and image transmission from a single provider . New Yorkers may soon get a taste of what 's to come , now that the Federal Communications Commission has approved local carrier Bell Atlantic 's plan to begin offering long-distance service . To date , however , about the only thing that 's being " bundled " are the phone carriers themselves as they gobble up each other in mergers . <p> If telecom deregulation is leaving you perplexed about the choices in services and hardware - and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and now - we can help . This report will guide you through a four-step approach to get the best price for phone service that meets your needs . Then , in the report " The New Sell in Cellular , " we 'll focus on the fast-changing options for wireless service and handsets . Finally , in the report " Choose the Right Cordless Phone , " we 'll bring you up-to-date on the latest in untethered calling at home . Press 1 to find your type of caller <p> Matching your phone service to your specific calling patterns and volume is the crucial first step in getting your money 's worth . If you make few calls , you do n't want to pay for more than bare basics . But if you 're a high-volume caller , you 'll want to take advantage of a discount plan . This article will help callers in each of three categories pin down the best options . LOW-VOLUME USER <p> You make brief and infrequent local calls and only a few long-distance calls per month . You do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you do want the ability to make calls when away from home . Services you want : Local and regional calls <p> If you make just three or four calls per day , you can get by on the bare-bones service offered in your community . Your best bet <p> Make sure you 're not paying for service you do n't use . Many consumers pay a flat rate for their local services yet do n't make much use of unlimited calling . If you live in one of the few areas where there 's local competition , call at least one other provider to see how much it charges for comparable service . Services you want : Long distance <p> If your long-distance calls total less than $10 or so per month , the extra monthly minimums , fees , and taxes make the per-minute costs exorbitant . Consider dropping your long-distance direct-dial provider , but check with your local provider first to make sure you can still make direct calls to adjacent area codes . When your calls exceed that $10 per month , you 'll need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long-distance carrier . Your best bet <p> You 're probably paying too much if your long-distance calls are costing you more than 10 cents or so per minute after factoring in any monthly minimum call charge . Your best option would be to choose a long-distance plan that does n't assess such a charge . See the article " For today 's competitive rates , " below . <p> A low-cost dial-around service , PT-1 charges 7.9 cents a minute for domestic long-distance calls . Dial the 101-6868 access code before each long-distance number you call . Charges will appear on your local phone bill . <p> You can buy a prepaid calling card at www.bigzoo.com and pay 3.9 cents a minute for long-distance calls made within the U.S. Services you want : Calls made while away from home <p> Use a calling card rather than pay the higher rates charged by hotels or levied at pay phones . Your best bet <p> There 's no reason to pay more than 17 cents per minute for calling-card calls . Look for a prepaid or low-rate calling card that does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this type of card from your home phone . See the article " Press 3 for today 's most competitive rates , " below , for details . When is it time to add services ? <p> If your call volume increases , start shopping for a lower-cost plan . You may want to reinstate dial-1 service , which allows you to make direct-dial long-distance calls , and sign up for a calling plan . You may want to add Internet access or get a cell phone for emergency use . MODERATE USER <p> You probably have two phone lines , one for your regular calls and one for your Internet connection , fax , or teenagers . You spend more than $15 a month on long-distance calls and have at least one calling card . And if you do n't already have a cell phone , you 're probably thinking of getting one for emergencies and convenience calls . Services you want : Local and regional calls <p> You want the most favorable volume plan or the lowest per-call rates that your calling patterns and volume permit . Your best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more-competitive rates than your local service provider . If there is competition in your area for local services , call at least one other provider to compare those rates with your current carrier 's prices . Services you want : Long-distance calls <p> You need a discount calling plan that combines low per-minute rates and modest minimum charges to produce the lowest overall cost . Your best bet <p> Decide whether you want only one provider who will bill you for local , regional , and long-distance calls or whether you are willing to cherry-pick the cheapest rates from various providers and pay several bills . See the article " Press 3 for today 's most competitive rates " to find a good long-distance plan . Services you want : International calls <p> Sign up for a discount calling plan with special international rates , but expect to pay an additional monthly fee . You should also look for a dial-around service with cheap rates to the countries you call . Your best bet <p> Calling plans with competitive domestic long-distance rates usually have discounted rates for international calls , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some dial-around services . Compare the rates of the dial-around services listed in the article " Press 3 for today 's most competitive rates " to see if you can beat what your long-distance provider charges . Services you want : Second phone line <p> If your phone line is being shared with a home office , teenagers , or a regularly used Internet connection , you may need a second line . Your best bet <p> You may have to pay a higher carrier line charge and higher long-distance access fees for a second line than you do for a primary number . Be sure you 're not paying for any extra features you do n't use , such as three-way calling or caller ID . Services you want : Internet access <p> If you spend a lot of time online , look for a plan with unlimited access . Consider using a provider that gives you a discount for using both its phone and its Internet service . Your best bet <p> Switching from your current Internet service provider and long-distance company to a combined plan could save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attractive phone rate . Where available , GTC Freenet ( 800 486-4030 : www.gtctelecom.com ) charges $4.95 a month for unlimited web access and 7.9 cents a minute for long-distance . Services you want : Calls away from home <p> Look for a calling card with low per-minute rates and a toll-free number for your home , if that 's where you call . Your best bet <p> See the article " Press 3 for todays 's most competitive rates " for attractively priced calling cards . Ask your long-distance provider what it charges for a personal 800 number . The rates may be cheaper for you or your family members than using a calling card to phone home from the road . When is it time to add services ? <p> Despite all your connections , you need more bandwidth . Your kids may be tying up your phone line . You may be going over the allotted minutes in your cell-phone plan . You and your children may be competing to use the Internet . HIGH-VOLUME USER <p> In addition to the local , regional , and long-distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least one cell phone . You 're tempted by the new offers for high-speed Internet access and are deciding whether to step up to a cable modem or to a digital subscriber line ( DSL ) . You 're tempted by the prospect of getting all your charges combined onto one bill , with one phone number you can call for customer service . Services you want : Multiple services <p> If you have several phone lines , at least one cell phone , and DSL service but little time to stay abreast of the latest offerings , look for a provider that can give you a package deal . Your best bet <p> The biggest providers are adding to their offerings every day . MCI wants you to buy Internet service when you sign up for long-distance , for example . AT &T; and Sprint are beginning to roll out the most comprehensive packages , including combinations of home phone service , cellular service , and high-speed Internet access in one bundle . Services you want : Cell-phone calls <p> You need good service for the places where you live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of minutes you talk . Your best bet <p> If there 's more than one cell-phone user in your family , look into one of the new multi-phone or family plans . Those offered by Sprint and AT &T; let you share calling minutes , but both phones must use the same provider . So-called bucket plans give hundreds of included minutes for local and long-distance calls . See the report " The New Sell in Cellular " for details . Services you want : High-speed Internet access <p> Cable-TV operators , phone companies , and other providers have begun to offer Internet connections that can be as much as 30 to 50 times faster than what a 56k modem can deliver . A cable modem lets you get on the web without having to dial a special number . With DSL service , you can even speak on the phone and surf the web at the same time . Your best bet <p> Read the offers carefully . If you do n't commit to a one-year package for DSL service , for example , you 'll probably have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs and about $50 a month . If cable modems are available in your area , you wo n't have a choice of providers .

LONG-DISTANCE SERVICE <p> Having long-distance service is n't as simple as paying for each call you make . In addition to the monthly fees and minimums your calling plan may require , you 'll face regular monthly charges even if you make no calls . <p> Minimum monthly charge Many carriers bill you a fixed amount , typically between $3 and $5 per month , even if you make no long-distance calls . <p> Potential error : By focusing exclusively on the cost of each call and ignoring this minimum , your monthly outlays may be higher than necessary .

The money goes to pay phone owners . Press 3 for today 's most competitive rates <p> We scoured phone-company offers , scrutinized newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web sites to turn up attractive current deals available for the kinds of telecom services you 're apt to use most . LONG-DISTANCE PLANS <p> Some 500 companies are now selling long-distance service . Yet remarkably , 16 years after the breakup of the Bell monopoly , the majority of residential consumers still pay full fare for their long-distance calls , which can cost 25 cents or more per minute . AT &T,; MCI , and Sprint command nearly 80 percent of the long-distance market . Recent deep rate cuts among these dominant carriers have dramatically increased opportunities to save . You can also find good deals from several lesser-known companies . But watch out for monthly minimum charges , fees , and frequent rate changes that can make a good per-minute rate expensive . TABLE CALLING CARDS <p> You can get competitive rates for calls made on the go - from hotel rooms , pay phones , clients ' offices , friends ' homes - by using a calling card . Although you may have a card from the carrier that gives you the good rate for long-distance calls you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best bet for calls away from home . Quite the contrary : The calling card that comes with the Sprint Nickel Nights plan charges 59 cents per minute for calling-card calls plus a 99-cent surcharge per call . Here are five deals we found that offer more-attractive rates . Some cards add a universal service fee that adds between 4 and 5 percent to to your calling-card charges . TABLE DIAL-AROUND SERVICES <p> Now that many regular long-distance calling plans routinely charge 10 cents or less per minutes , those 10-10 dial-around services have tough competition . You can still find dial-arounds that offer attractive rates , especially for overseas calls : We found prices as low as 7.9 cents per minute for calls to Western Europe and 26 cents to Central America . Domestic rates , too , can still offer savings compared with some competitive long-distance plans , but rates and terms change often , so stay alert . TABLE Press 4 for web sites that can help you keep your phone costs low <p> Since your telecommunications needs are likely to evolve and rate plans change frequently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least once a year .

The web sites describes here continually review a wide variety of long-distance plans , and most let you tailor your search to plans that match your calling pattern . But use the information you glean from them only as a guide . Carriers adjust their rates often , so the prices that are compared may not always be the most current . And the web sites are often paid by the phone companies , so they may not always offer the best price for your needs . <p> www.abelltolls.com : There 's no customized rate-comparison feature , this site does have extensive information about current offerings from a long list of companies as well as on calling cards and dial-around services . <p> www.cognigen.com : Searches the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though it will let you search only one call at a time . <p> www.decide.com : Compares prices for eight carriers .

Monthly minimum charges and higher fees are making calls more expensive than ever for less-affluent Americans and other low-volume callers , even as per-minute cost have dropped and new services have proliferated . This adds up to a lot of people ; the median household still makes fewer than 50 minutes of long-distance calls per month . <p> A new digital divide is forming between those who can afford the benefits of deregulation and those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study by Consumers Union , the the Consumer Federation of America , and the Texas Office of Public Utility Counsel , households that make fewer than 25 minutes of long-distance calls a month now pay 27 percent more for their phone bills than they did in 1996 . Many of these people live in a household with an annual income below $20,000 . Residential consumers who make few long-distance calls , the study found , are paying a net annual increase in the past four years of about $2.3 billion for phone service - mostly because of those higher fixed monthly costs . Consumers Union has called on federal regulators to order phone companies to eliminate these charges . <p> Low-income consumers who qualify for government assistance are generally eligible for lifeline programs . These typically reduce the initial cost to set up service and lower the monthly fees . Long-distance companies also have special programs for qualifying low-income callers . AT &T; waives monthly minimums , universal service fees , and pre-subscribed interexchange carriers charges . MCI Worldcom 's Family Assist plan has no fees or minimums and charges callers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents a minute for night and weekend calls . <p>
