London , England September , 1844 <p> COVENT GARDEN KILLER STRIKES AGAIN . <p> Londoners grow nervous . <p> Thor scanned the front page article in the London Times  --  details of the second brutal murder in the Covent Garden district in the last six months . <p> Unlike his older brother , Leif , Thor was n't much of a reader . He figured the best use for a newspaper was to wrap up dead fish . He admitted it was probably important to keep up with what was happening around him , so he struggled through the English words , a language he had only started learning a little over two years ago . Before that , he had lived on an island far to the north , an isolated world only a handful of people knew existed . <p> With the help of his teacher , Professor Paxton Hart , he had learned to read and write , how to dress and move about in English society . Leif and his wife helped as well , and life here grew easier all the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside reading a book . <p> " So you 're the one who stole my paper ! " An indignant female voice snagged his attention . " I 've been looking all over . " Hands on hips , Lindsey Graham marched across the office like a raven swooping down on its prey . <p> Holding the evidence of his guilt in one big hand , Thor stood in the doorway of the back room of Heart to Heart , the ladies ' magazine owned by his brother 's wife , Krista Hart Draugr , and her father , his teacher , Sir Paxton Hart . It was Thursday , the day before the paper came out , and the office hummed with activity . <p> " I did not steal it , " he said to the avenging angel bearing down on him . " I borrowed it . I wanted to know about the murder . " <p> Her eyes shot to his , a tawny golden color like the she-cat she was . " There was a second murder ? " <p> He nodded , held the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covent Garden , " he said . " Same as before . " <p> Lindsey took the newspaper and scanned the article . She was taller than the average woman , yet far shorter than his six-foot-five-inch frame . She was slender , her hair a light golden brown . With her fine-boned , delicate features , she was pretty , but not in the way he preferred . <p> Like his brother , he wanted his women lusty , buxom and full-breasted , the kind built to satisfy a man . Leif had found Krista , the mate of his heart . Thor was still looking for the female who would be his . <p> " Another woman killed , " Lindsey said , her tawny gaze glued to the page , " strangled just like the last time . The police believe the same man is likely responsible . " <p> Lindsey was editor of the women 's section of the paper and also wrote a gossip column called Heartbeat . She was a hard worker , he knew , a quality he admired since he worked so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bossing the stevedores who loaded and unloaded the cargo carried by his brother 's company , Valhalla Shipping , he worked for Heart to Heart . He was saving his money to buy a place in the country , far away from the choking air of London . <p> " Here 's something new , " Lindsey went on , her fine , straight nose immersed in the printed lines . " It says the women who were killed were ' ladies of the evening . ' " <p> " Whores , " Thor said simply . <p> Lindsey blushed . " That does not mean it is all right for someone to kill them . " <p> " I did not say that . " <p> She sighed . " I feel sorry for the people who live in the neighborhood . Two murders in the last six months . They must be terrified . I certainly hope the police apprehend him this time . " <p> " The paper says they have found clues . They believe they will soon have a suspect . Mayhap this time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have discovered . " <p> Thor made no reply , since neither of them knew the answer . Engrossed in the paper , Lindsey wandered over to her desk , sat down and continued to read . In the middle of the room , the big Stanhope press sat silent , but soon the next edition would be rumbling off for sale on the streets . <p> Thor liked to watch the press at work . In truth , he was amazed by the heavy machinery he had seen since his arrival in England , equipment that could spin cotton into cloth , or press glass into various shapes and sizes . There were even powerful steam machines called locomotives that could carry people to distant places in hours instead of days . <p> There was nothing like that on the remote island of Draugr where he and Leif had been born and raised . People on Draugr still lived as they had hundreds of years ago . They were warriors and farmers , not city dwellers like the people in London . <p> Flashing a smile at the typesetter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he were her son , he went back to work stacking boxes and crates , making room for tomorrow 's papers . <p> It was only a few minutes later that the bell rang above the front door , drawing his attention to a thin man , slightly beak-nosed and dark-haired , who walked into the office . Dressed in an expensive-looking dark brown tailcoat and tan trousers , he carried one of those stupid high hats London men favored and Thor flatly refused to wear . <p> Returning to his work , he forgot about the man until he heard voices raised in anger . Saying a grateful prayer that this time the object of Lindsey 's wrath was someone else , he gazed through the door in her direction and saw the well-dressed man standing next to her desk . They were arguing . Noticing the hard set of the man 's jaw , the blood-lust in his eyes , Thor 's senses went on alert . <p> Lindsey clamped her hands on her hips . " I do n't give a fig whether you bloody well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheating on your wife , I would n't have found out and I would n't have written about you in my column ! " <p> " You little bitch ! My wife is threatening divorce . I am the Earl of Fulcroft and a Whitfield , and Whitfields do not divorce ! You will write a retraction immediately or I will personally see you ruined ! " <p> " And how , may I ask , do you intend to do that ? " <p> A grim smile curved the earl 's lips . " I will dig into your past until I find something that will scandalize the very people your column is meant to impress . There will be something  --  there always is  --  no matter how young and innocent you seem . And I shall keep digging until I find it ! Then we 'll see how much you ' bloody well like it ! ' " <p> Thor had heard enough . Seeing Lindsey 's face had turned a little pale , he strode toward Fulcroft , grabbed him by the lapels of his expensive coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are finished with your threats to the lady . You will apologize for the name you called her and then you will leave . " <p> " Put me down this instant ! " <p> Ignoring the stunned look on Lindsey 's face , Thor shook him like the rat he was . " I said you will apologize . Do it now . " <p> The earl dangled there , his feet swinging , his shiny leather shoes dangling several inches above the floor . " All right , all right . I 'm sorry I called you a bitch . Now put me down ! " <p> Thor set the man back on his feet and the earl eased toward the door . He pierced Lindsey with a glare . " Your bulldog notwithstanding , I meant every word . I 'll expect to read your retraction in the next edition of the paper . " <p> " Do n't hold your breath ! " Lindsey called after him as he turned and hurried out of the office . <p> Thor was feeling well pleased with himself when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that again ! " <p> " What are you talking about ? " <p> " You interfered in my business . I can deal with my problems myself . I do n't need any help from you . " <p> Thor clenched his jaw . " You wished for the man to continue his insults ? You did not mind that he called you a female dog ? " <p> Her eyes widened . Then a corner of her mouth twitched . " I minded . But I could have handled him myself . " <p> " Fine . The next time a man insults you , I will pretend not to hear . Does that suit you , lady ? " <p> Her eyes held his an instant before she glanced away . " It suits me . I do n't need your help or anyone else 's . " <p> Thor shook his head . " Stubborn as an ugly horse . " <p> " You mean mule , " she corrected . <p> " Fine . Stubborn as a mule . " <p> Lindsey flashed him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damned woman , he thought , trying not to notice the way her hips swayed beneath her full skirts , to wonder if her waist was really small enough for his hands to fit around it . She was as slender as a boy . Why he should notice her at all he could not imagine . <p> Still , he had to admit she had a very pretty face and skin as smooth and pale as cream . Her hair , the color of rich , dark honey , shimmered in the sun shining in through the window . <p> His body tightened . Grinding his jaw against a shot of lust that angered him more than aroused him , he strode back to the rear of the office and began stacking the rest of the newspaper bundles . <p> He was n't attracted to Lindsey Graham . She was n't the sort of woman he found the least attractive . But as she moved across the office in that graceful way of hers , Thor found himself watching her again . <p> Lindsey finished reworking the notes she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the office , she could hear Thor at work loading stacks of bound newspapers , getting ready for the edition that would be on the streets tomorrow . <p> Lindsey knew Krista was eager for this particular issue to come out . She was campaigning hard against the institution of baby farming , the awful practice of selling illegitimate infants into places that ultimately resulted in their deaths , neatly disposing of unwanted problems . <p> Their mutual friend , Coralee Whitmore Forsythe , had uncovered the terrible practice during her search for the man who had murdered her sister . While Corrie was away on her quest , Lindsey had taken over writing the society column for the gazette . Though Corrie was currently on her honeymoon with her husband , the Earl of Tremaine , once she returned to England , she and Gray would add their support to Krista 's campaign . <p> Lindsey glanced through the door leading into the back room of the office . She could see Thor at work , his powerful body hoisting and moving the bound stacks of newspapers as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thor was a man who seemed to enjoy physical exertion . <p> He was n't obsessed with learning as his older brother , Leif , had been , but considering he had arrived in England only a few years ago , he had educated himself fairly well . <p> She did n't know much about him , only that he came from some tiny island north of the Orkneys . He spoke English well , with just a slight accent that sounded faintly Norwegian . He could read and write , though not as well as he could speak , and Krista and her father had taught him at least the basics necessary to move about in polite society . <p> Still , in most ways , the man was a barbarian . He had no interest in the arts , theater , or opera , no desire to attend the soirees , balls , and risottos that Lindsey enjoyed so much . As society editor of Heart to Heart and author of the weekly gossip column , Heartbeat , it was necessary for her to mingle and mix with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lindsey did it well . <p> She liked her job , liked the independence it gave her . Of course , in the beginning , her mother and father had been horrified at the notion of their twenty-two-year-old daughter actually working , but they were gone a great deal and Lindsey had insisted she needed something to do . In the end , as usual , she had gotten her way . <p> Once again , her parents were traveling on the Continent , leaving Lindsey in the house under the care of her mother 's older sister , Delilah Markham , Countess of Ashford . Lindsey liked her aunt , an extremely forward-thinking woman who , at forty-six , had lived an exciting life and intended to enjoy every moment of the years ahead . <p> Which meant that basically , Lindsey was on her own . <p> It was warm in the office this early September day . Lindsey fanned herself with the newspaper she had been reading , then flicked a glance toward the back of the building , where Thor bent down to hoist another bundle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cravat or stock . <p> Her eyes widened as she realized the man had stripped off his tailcoat and unbuttoned his fine lawn shirt all the way to his navel . She could see his massive chest , a wide V of swarthy skin covered by thick slabs of muscle , even the ladder of muscle across his flat belly . The work was heavy and perspiration ran in rivulets through his dark hair and down his thick neck . It plastered his shirt to his incredible body . His arms bulged with muscle , and when he turned away , slabs of muscle tightened across his broad back . <p> Lindsey 's stomach contracted . The only thing the big brute had going for him was a body that seemed to mimic the Norse god he was named for , and eyes so blue that when you looked into them , you felt as if you might disappear . <p> It simply was n't fair that a man should look so good on the outside and have so little of interest on the inside . <p> It simply was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unable to look away , fascinated until he turned round and caught her . <p> His dark head came up and those incredible blue eyes locked on her face . <p> " I am not decently clothed , " he said . " A lady would not look . " <p> Her chin inched up . " And a gentleman would not disrobe except in private ! " Whirling her chair around , her pulse hammering far too fast , she jerked her plumed pen from its silver holder , jabbed it into the inkwell and stabbed it down on the paper , leaving a purple stain as she tried to scratch out the first paragraph of her upcoming column . <p> Thor said something beneath his breath and went back to hoisting bundles . <p> " Are you all right ? " <p> Her head came up and she flushed guiltily at the sight of her employer and best friend , Krista Hart Draugr , approaching her desk . She started to say that she was just fine before Thor had stripped off half his clothes , but stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd had earlier with the Earl of Fulcroft , not Thor . <p> " Bessie told me about the earl , " Krista went on . " I 'm sorry I was n't here . " She was tall , taller than most men , except , of course , for her husband and Thor . With her big green eyes and golden blond hair , she was a beautiful woman . And she had found exactly the right man for her in Leif . The pair had a nine-month-old son they adored , and as virile as both brothers appeared to be , soon there would probably be another addition to the family . <p> Lindsey looked up at Krista and smiled . " I am fine . Fulcroft was just blowing off steam . " <br> Continues ...
