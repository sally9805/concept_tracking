In your relationship , are you a cop , a comedian , a prince or a martyr ? Robert J. Sternberg , Ph.D. , reveals how you can use your " love story " to find your perfect match . // Relationships can be as unpredictable as the most suspense-filled mystery novel . Why do some couples live happily ever after , while others are as starcrossed as Romeo and Juliet ? Why do we often seem destined to relive the same romantic mistakes over and over , following the same script with different people in dif ferent places , as if the fate of our relationships , from courtship to demise , were written at birth ? Perhaps because , in essence , it is . As much as psychologists have attempted to explain the mysteries of love through scientific laws and theories , it turns out that the best mirrors of the romantic experience may be Wuthering Heights , Casablanca and General Hospital . At some level , lay people recognize what many psychologists do n't that the love between two people follows a story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the stories that dictate our beliefs and expectations of love . These stories , which we start to write as children , predict the patterns of our romantic experiences time and time again . Luckily , we can learn to rewrite them . I came up with the theory of love as a story because I was dissatisfied-not only with other people 's work on love , but also with my own . I had initially proposed a triangular theory of love , suggesting that it comprises three elements : intimacy , passion and commitment . Different loving relationships have different combinations of these elements . Complete love requires all three elements . But the theory leaves an important question unanswered : What makes a person the kind of lover they are ? And what attracts them to other lovers ? I had to dig deeper to understand the love 's origins . I found them in stories . My research , which incorporates studies performed over the past decade with hundreds of couples in Connecticut , as well as ongoing studies , has shown that people describe love in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , someone who strongly agrees with the statement " I believe close relationships are like good partnerships " tells a business story ; someone who says they end up with partners who scare them-or that they like intimidating their partner-enacts a horror story . Photograph Photograph // Couples usually start out being physical ly attracted and having similar interests and values . But eventually , they may notice something missing in the relationship . That something is usually story compatibility . A couple whose stories do n't match is like two characters on one stage acting out different plays-they may look right at first glance , but there is an underlying lack of coordination to their interaction . This is why couples that seem likely to thrive often do not , and couples that seem unlikely to survive sometimes do . Two people may have similar outlooks , but if one longs to be rescued like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman and the other wants a partnership like the lawyers on the television show The Practice , the relationship may not go very far . In contrast , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf may seem wildly incompatible to their friends , but their shared need for combat may be what keeps their love alive . More than anything , the key to compatibility with a romantic partner is whether our stories match . To change the pattern of our relationships , we must become conscious of our love stories , seek people with compatible tales , and replot conclusions that are n't working for us . The Beginning of the Story We start forming our ideas about love soon after birth , based on our inborn personality , our early experiences and our observations of our parents ' relationships , as well as depictions of romance in movies , television and books . We then seek to live out these conceptions of love ourselves . Based on interviews I conducted in the I990s , asking college students to write about their romantic ideals and expectations , I have identified at least 25 common stories which people use to describe love . ( There are probably many more . ) Some stories are far more popular than others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I identified some of the most common tales by asking people to rate , on a scale of one to seven , the extent to which a group of statements characterized their relationships . Their highest-ranked statements indicated their personal love story . Among the most popular were the travel story ( " I believe that beginning a relationship is like starting a new journey that promises to be both exciting and challenging " ) , the gardening story ( " I believe any relationship that is left unattended will not survive " ) and the humor story ( " I think taking a relationship too seriously can spoil it 'd . Among the least popular were the horror story ( " I find it exciting when I feel my partner is somewhat frightened of me , " or " I tend to end up with people who frighten me " ) , the collectibles story ( " I like dating different partners simultaneously ; each partner should fit a particular need " ) and the autocratic government story ( " I think it is more efficient if one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' ) . Another study of 43 couples , conducted with Mahzad Hojji , Ph.D. , in 1996 , showed that women prefer the travel story more than men , who prefer the art ( " Physical attractiveness is the most essential characteristic I look for in a partner " ) , collectibles and pornography ( " It is very important to be able to gratify all my partner 's sexual desires and whims , " or " I can never be happy with a partner who is not very adventurous in his or her sex life " ) stories . Men also prefer the sacrifice story ( " I believe sacrifice is a key part of true love " ) . Originally , we had expected the opposite . Then we realized that the men reported sacrificing things that women did consider significant offerings . No one story guarantees success , our study showed . But some stories seem to predict doom more than others : the business , collectibles , government , horror , mystery , police ( " I believe it is necessary to watch your partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me several times a day to ask what I am doing " ) , recovery ( " I of ten find myself helping people get their life back in order " or " I need someone to help me recover from my painful past " ) , science fiction ( " I often find myself attracted to individuals who have unusual and strange characteristics " ) and theater stories ( " I think my relationships are like plays " or " I often find myself attracted to partners who play different roles " ) . Now Stories Spin Our Relationships When you talk to two people who have just split up , their breakup stories often sound like depictions of two completely different relationships . In a sense , they are . Each partner has his or her own story to tell . Most important to a healthy , happy relationship is that both partners have compatible stories-that is , compatible expectations . Indeed , a 1998 study conducted with Mahzad Hojjat , Ph.D. , and Michael Barnes , Ph.D. , indicated that the more similar couples ' stories were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compatible if they are complementary roles in a single story , such as prince and princess , or if the stories are similar enough that they can be merged into a new and unified story . For example , a fantasy story can merge with a gardening story because one can nourish , or garden , a relationship while dreaming of being rescued by a knight on a white steed . A fantasy and a business story are unlikely to blend , however , because they represent such different ideals-fate-bound princes and princesses do n't work at romance ! Photograph // Of course , story compatibility is n't the only ingredient in a successful relationship . Sometimes , our favorite story can be hazardous to our well-being . People often try to make dangerous or unsatisfying stories come true . Thus , someone who has , say , a horror or recovery story may try to turn a healthy relationship into a Nightmare on Elm Street . People complain that they keep ending up with the same kind of bad partner , that they are unlucky in love . In reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are subconsciously finding people to play out their love stories , or foisting their stories on the people they meet . Making Happy Endings Treating problems in relationships by changing our behaviors and habits ultimately wo n't work because crisis comes from the story we 're playing out . Unless we change our stories , we 're treating symptoms rather than causes . If we 're dissatisfied with our partner , we should look not at his or her faults , but at how he or she fits into our expectations . To figure out what we want , we need to consider all of our past relationships , and we should ask ourselves what attributes characterized the people to whom we felt most attracted , and what attributes characterized the people in whom we eventually lost interest . We also need to see which romantic tale we aim to tell-and whether or not it has the potential to lead to a " happily ever after " scenario ( see quiz , page 55 ) . Once we understand the ideas and beliefs behind the stories we accept as our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves what we like and do n't like about our current story , what has n't been working in our relationships , and how we would like to change it . How can we rewrite the scenario ? This may involve changing stories , or transforming an existing story to make it more practical . For example , horror stories may be fantasized during sexual or other activity , rather than actually physically played out . We can change our story by experimenting with new and different plots . Sometimes , psychotherapy can help us to move from perilous stories ( such as a honor story ) to more promising ones ( such as a travel story ) . Once we 've recognized our story-or learned to live a healthy one of our choosing-we can begin to recognize elements of that story in potential mates . Love mirrors stories because it is a story itself . The difference is that we are the authors , and can write ourselves a happy ending . READ MORE ABOUT IT Love is a Story , Robert J. Sternberg , Ph.D . ( Oxford University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diane Ackerman ( Random House , 1994 ) Sidebar Find Your Love Story Adapted from Love Is A Story by Robert J. Sternberg , Ph . D. Rate each statement on a state from 1 to 9 , 1 meaning that tt does n't characterize your romantic relationships at all , 9 meaning that it describes them extremely well . Then average your scores for each story . in general , averaged scores of 7 to 9 are high , indicating a strong attraction to a story , and 1 to 3 are low , indicating little or no interest in the story . Moderate scores of 4 to 6 indicate some Interest , but probably not enough to generate or keep a romantic interest . Next , evaluate your own love story . ( There are 12 listed here ; see the book for more . ) STORY #1 1 . I enjoy making sacrifices for the sake of my partner . 2 . I believe sacrifice is a key part of true love . 3 . I often compromise my own comfort to satisfy my partner 's needs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when both partners are content in the roles they are playing , particularly when they both make sacrifices . It is likely to cause friction when partners feel compelled to make sacrifices . Research suggests that relationships of all kinds are happiest when they are roughly equitable . The greatest risk in a sacrifice story is that the giveand-take will become too out of balance , with one partner always being the giver or receiver . STORY #2 Officer : 1 . I believe that you need to keep a close eye on your partner . 2 . I believe it is foolish to trust your partner completely . 3 : I would never trust my partner to work closely with a person of the opposite sex Score : Sidebar Suspect : 1 My partner often calls me several times a day to ask exactly what I am doing . 2 . My partner needs to know everything that I do . 3 . My partner gets very upset if I do n't let him or her know exactly where I have been . Score : Police stories do not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The police story may of fer some people the feeling of being cared for . People who are very insecure relish the attention that they get as a " suspect , " that they are unable to receive in any other way . But they can end up paying a steep price . As the plot thickens , the suspect first begins to lose freedom , then dignity , and then any kind of self respect . Eventually , the person 's mental and even physical well-being may be threatened . STORY #3 1 . I believe that , in a good relationship , partners change and grow together . 2 . I believe love is a constant process of discovery and growth . 3 . I believe that beginning a relationship is like starting a new journey that promises to be both exciting and challenging . Score : Travel stories that last beyond a very short period of time generally have a favorable prognosis , because if the travelers can agree on a destination and path , they are already a long way toward success . If they ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want different things from the relationship and split up . Travel relationships tend to be dynamic and focus on the future . The greatest risk is that over time one or both partners will change the destination or path they desire . When people speak of growing apart , they often mean that the paths they wish to take are no longer the same . In such cases , the relationship is likely to become increasingly unhappy , or even dissolve completely STORY #4 Object : 1 . The truth is that I do n't mind being treated as a sex toy by my partner . 2 . It is very important to me to gratify my partner 's sexual desires and whims , even if people might view them as debasing. 3 . I like it when my partner wants me to try new and unusual , and even painful , sexual techniques . Score : Subject : 1 The most important thing to me in my relationship is for my partner to be an excellent sex toy , doing anything I desire . 2 . I can never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex . 3 . The truth is that I like a partner who feels like a sex object . Score : There are no obvious advantages to the pornography story . The disadvantages are quite dear , however . First , the excitement people attain is through degradation of themselves and others . Second , the need to debase and be debased is likely to keep escalating . Third , once one adopts the story , it may be difficult to adopt another story . Fourth , the story can become physically as well as psychologically dangerous . And finally , no matter how one tries , it is difficult to turn the story into one that 's good for psychological or physical well-being . STORY #5 Terrorizer. 1 . I often make sure that my partner knows that I am in charge , even if it makes him or her scared of me. 2 . I actually find it exciting when I feel my partner is somewhat frightened of me. 3 . I sometimes do things that scare my partner , because I think it is actually good for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Score : Victim : 1 . I believe it is somewhat exciting to be slightly scared of your partner . 2 . I find it arousing when my partner creates a sense of fear in me. 3 . I tend to end up with people who sometimes frighten me . Score : The horror story probably is the least advantageous of the stories . To some , it may be exciting , But the forms of terror needed to sustain the excitement tend to get out of control and to put their participants , and even sometimes those around them , at both psychological and physical risk . Those who discover that they have this story or are in a relationship that is enacting it would be well-advised to seek counseling , and perhaps even police protection . STORY #6 Co-dependent : 1 . I often end up with people who are facing a specific problem , and I find myself helping them get their life back in order . 2 . I enjoy being involved in relationships in which my partner needs my help to get over some problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need my help to recover from their past . Score : Person In recovery : 1 . I need someone who will help me recover from my painful past . 2 . I believe that a relationship can save me from a life that is crumbling around me. 3 . I need help getting over my past Score : The main advantage to the recovery story is that the co-dependent may really help the other partner to recover , so long as the other partner has genuinely made the decision to recover . Many of us know individuals who sought to reform their partners , only to experience total frustration when their partners made little or no effort to reform . At the same time , the co-dependent is someone who needs to feel he or she is helping someone , and gains this feeling of making a difference to someone through Sidebar the relationship . The problem : Others can assist in recovery , but the decision to recover can only be made by the person in need of recovery . As a result , recovery stories can assist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . I believe a good relationship is attainable only if you spend time and energy to care for it , just as you tend a garden . 2 . I believe relationships need to be nourished constantly to help weather the ups and downs of life . 3 . I believe the secret to a successful relationship is the care that partners take of each other and of their love . See : The biggest advantage of a garden story is its recognition of the importance of nurture . No other story involves this amount of care and attention . The biggest potential disadvantage is that a lack of spontaneity or boredom may develop . People in garden stories are not immune to the lure of extramarital relationships , for example , and may get involved in them to generate excitement , even if they still highly value their primary relationship . In getting involved in other relationships , however , they are putting the primary relationship at risk . Another potential disadvantage is that of smothering that the attention becomes too much . Just as one can overwater a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's best to let things be and allow nature to take its course . STORY #8 1 I believe that close relationships are partnerships . 2 . I believe that in a romantic relationship , just as in a job , both partners should perform their duties and responsibilities according to their " job description . " 3 . Whenever I consider having a relationship with someone , I always consider the financial implications of the relationship as well . Score : A business story has several potential advantages , not the least of which is that the bills are more likely to get paid than in other types of relationships . That 's because someone is always minding the store . Another potential advantage is that the roles tend to be more clearly defined than in other relationships . The partners are also in a good position to " get ahead " in terms of whatever it is that they want . One potential disadvantage occurs if only one of the two partners sees their relationship as a business story . The other partner may quickly become bored and look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also turn sour if the distribution of authority does not satisfy one or both partners . If the partners can not work out mutually compatible roles , they may find themselves spending a lot of time fighting for position . It is important to maintain the option of flexibility . Sidebar STORY #9 1 . I think fairy tales about relationships can come true . 2 . I do believe that there is someone out there for me who is my perfect match . 3. like my relationships to be ones in which I view my partner as something like a prince or princess in days of yore . Score : The fantasy story can be a powerful one . The individual may feel swept up in the emotion of the search for the perfect partner or of developing the perfect relationship with an existing partner . It is probably no coincidence that in literature most fantasy stories take place before or outside of marriage : Fantasies are hard to maintain when one has to pay the bills , pack the children off to school and resolve marital fights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one has to ignore , to some extent , the mundane aspects of life . The potential disadvantages of the fantasy relationship are quite plain . The greatest is the possibility for disillusionment when one partner discovers that no one could fulfill the fantastic expectations that have been created . This can lead partners to feel dissatisfied with relationships that most others would view as quite successful . If a couple can create a fantasy story based on realistic rather than idealistic ideals , they have the potential for success ; if they want to be characters in a myth , chances are that 's exactly what they 'll get : a myth . STORY #10 1 I think it is more interesting to argue than to compromise . 2 . I think frequent arguments help bring conflictive issues into the open and keep the relationship healthy . 3 . I actually like to fight with my partner . Score : The war story is advantageous in a relationship only when both partners clearly share it and want the same thing . In these cases , threats of divorce and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream of leaving . They 're both having too much fun , in their own way The major disadvantage , of course , is that the story often is n't shared , leading to intense and sustained conflict that can leave the partner without the war story feeling devastated much of the time . People can find themselves in a warring relationship without either of them having war as a preferred story . In such cases , the constant fighting may make both partners miserable . If the war continues in such a context , there is no joy in it for either partner . STORY #11 Audience : 1 . I like a partner who is willing to think about the funny side of our conflicts . 2 , I think taking a relationship too seriously can spoil it ; that 's why I like partners who have a sense of humor . 3 , I like a partner who makes me laugh whenever we are facing a tense situation in our relationship . Sc.e : Comedian : 1 . I admit that I sometimes try to use humor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like to use humor when I have a conflict with my partner because I believe there is a humorous side to any conflict . 3 . When I disagree with my partner , I of ten try to make a joke out of it . Score : The humor story can have one enormous advantage : Most situations do have a lighter side , and people with this story are likely to see it . When things in a relationship become tense , sometimes nothing works better than a little humor , especially if it comes from within the relationship . Humor stories also allow relationships to be creative and dynamic . But the humor story also has some potential disadvantages . Probably the greatest one is the risk of using humor to deflect important issues : A serious conversation that needs to take place keeps getting put off with jokes . Humor can also be used to be cruel in a passive-aggressive way When humor is used as a means of demeaning a person to protect the comedian from responsibility ( " I was only joking " ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate amounts are good for a relationship , but excessive amounts can be deleterious . STORY #12 1 . I think it is okay to have multiple partners who fulfill my different needs . 2 . I sometimes like to think about how many people I could potentially date all at the same time . 3 . I tend and like to have multiple intimate partners at once , each fulfilling somewhat different roles . Score : There are a few advantages to a collection story . For one thing , the collector generally cares about the collectible 's physical well-being , as appearance is much of what makes a collection shine . The collector also finds a way of meeting multiple needs . Usually those needs will be met in parallel-by having several intimate relationships at the same time-but a collector may also enter into serial monogamous relationships , where each successive relationship meets needs that the last relationship did not meet . In a society that values monogamy , collection stories work best if they do not become serious or if individuals in the collection are each viewed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The disadvantages of this story become most obvious when people are trying to form serious relationships . The collector may find it dif ficult to establish intimacy , or anything approaching a complete relationship and commitment toward a single individual . Collections can also become expensive , time-consuming , and in some cases illegal ( as when an individual enters into multiple marriages simultaneously ) . Author Affiliation Robert J.
