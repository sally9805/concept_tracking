Wasteland You We keep burning in the brown smog pit . The girls swarm in their black moth dresses . Their scalps are shaved like concentration camp ladies . Rats click my head . Everything broken . When you were a baby I sat very still to hold you . I could see the veins through your skin like a map to inside you . How could skin be that thin ? I was so afraid you might drop and break . I stopped breathing so you would n't . When you were crying I got out of bed and went into your room . You were thrashing around behind the bars of the crib , your face twisted and red , like , how could they be doing this to me ? I did n't understand why Mom had n't come to you . You turned your head to look at me . Your eyes looked so big in your face , so mysterious  --  wide and flickering like a butterfly-wing mask . When you saw me the wails turned to sobs , and then just quieter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the bars . Then you reached out and curled your fingers around mine , so tight . I knew you recognized me . That was the first time I knew I had a heart inside my body . You still cry too easily , but without your tears , at least , everything would burn . You are Spring in your jeans , in the laughing leaves . I think pearls melted over your bones . I thought sacrifice might mean something . The wounds throb even though they 're not real yet . Would you reach inside them to uncover the secret ? You try to tell me but your tongue feels severed . Kaleidoscope You were just a boy on a bed in a room , like a kaleidoscope is a tube full of bits of broken glass . But the way I saw you was pieces refracting the light , shifting into an infinite universe of flowers and rainbows and insects and planets , magical dividing cells , pictures no one else knew . I remember . I was going on a date and I came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I pretended I was coming to see if you had any beers in the ice chest under your bed . I was wearing my shiny leotard and my wraparound skirt , my cork sandals and Jontue perfume and Bonne Bell lip gloss . I had shaved my legs and they were pretty tan already , even though it was May . I knocked and you did n't answer . I thought the music was too loud and you had n't heard . It was this crazy banging shouting music I 'd never heard before . I just opened the door . You jerked up and looked at me . You were in bed with the sheet over you and the room smelled close . I smelled your pot and beer and your smell  --  salty , warm , baked . I read in a magazine that women are n't supposed to be attracted to the smells of their fathers and brothers . You sat up and your eyes were blank and hard  --  mad . You yelled , What are you doing ? Do n't you knock anymore ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You said , I 'm sorry , you . Hang on , and I turned and pretended to look at some albums while you got up . You were buttoning your black jeans when I turned around . But you did n't have a shirt on . You looked pale  --  usually you were tan by spring , too , darker than me  --  but your skin was white and smooth like marble . I could see every segment of muscle in your stomach ; your arms looked stronger , too . There were some weights on the floor . I apologized and you sat on the bed and asked me what I wanted . You never asked me that when I came to you . We just accepted the pull that brought us into the same spaces as often as possible . I mumbled something about the beer . I wanted you to like my outfit , I wanted your praise because without it I felt like I was going to fade into nothing . This little shiny leotard and rayon jersey wrap skirt would walk out all alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Where are you going ? You sounded like a dad and it scared me . I said dancing . You asked where and I said , Kaleidoscope . You rolled your eyes . Why that disco shit ? You never spoke to me like that . I could feel my face getting hot . I hoped my tan and the Indian Earth makeup on my cheeks and eyelids would hide it . I smelled my perfume and it was way too sweet ; I wanted to smell like you . You saw me getting upset and you said you were sorry again . You asked if I was going on a date , I looked pretty . I said kind of . Michelle and I were meeting some boys . You asked who was driving . I said Michelle . You said you did n't want us drinking . You asked if you could drive . I said no . I did n't want you to see me with Brent Fisher . I was afraid you 'd tease me about him forever . You shrugged . You said , Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed and closed your eyes . I came home at about 2:30 . My leotard was sopping wet . I had sweated off all my lotion and perfume and deodorant and I kept sniffing my armpits on my way upstairs , touching with one fingertip and sniffing . I wondered if you could smell the beer that Brent Fisher and Billy Ellis got for us . I was chewing some Bubble Yum to try to hide it . The sugar coated my mouth but bitter , the sweet was all gone , like I 'd sipped perfume . I knocked and you answered . I could n't believe it when I saw you . Your head was shaved . I thought you looked so naked and different , vulnerable and ugly and beautiful ...
