In the early days of our NATO commitment in Bosnia , an Allied officer came to me and said , " Sir , we believe that Serbian war criminal Radovan Karadzic may have driven past our positions  --  but we are n't sure . " <P> That is a small foretaste of what is to come . It is difficult to direct military operations against specific individuals . For the Pentagon leadership , this is n't the war we trained to fight . It requires a fresh strategy , enhanced forces , new weapons and a changed attitude . The strategy  --  to attack the network of international terrorists and the governments or organizations that support them  --  will be based on deadly accurate police work . Force will be used only as necessary , for we are not terrorists and do not intend to strike innocent civilians . <P> This strategy requires attention to a whole range of intelligence-gathering methods that have taken second  --  or last  --  priority for years . We need face-to-face information collection : Who are these people , what are their intentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arrest them ? Technology is still important  --  night-vision gear , small handheld devices that monitor conversations and confirm identities  --  but more crucial will be a willingness to risk our personnel . Military intelligence will send our people into hostile situations under cover or with limited backup . <P> Most likely we will need more special-operations forces and not so many artillery outfits ; more self-contained operational forces and less logistical backup . We will want to go in quick and light , with minimal time for planning and deployment , and the smallest possible footprint . We will need lighter-weight communications with longer-lasting batteries and new small arms effective at close quarters and longer ranges . We want to pack our punch into smaller , more mobile packages . If we need heavy firepower , we want to call it down from the sky rather than backpack it in . We will be putting our people in harm 's way , facing off against what has been an implacable enemy . We can not expect success without taking casualties . <P> The Air Force is well prepared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in battle in Kosovo . And if the targets can be identified , then long-range strikes to disrupt terrorist activities may be warranted . But the resistance of a fanatic foe may be overcome only by boots on the ground . We will need enhanced air-transport capabilities and a reorganized and re-equipped ground force . <P> But the most important transformation may be one of attitude . After Vietnam , the U.S. has become extremely sensitive to casualties . Of all the obstacles the generals are facing , this may be the most difficult . <P> General Clark is a former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe
