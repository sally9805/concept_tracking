The RIDE PUT YOURSELF HERE // What bike commuter has not , at some point , wondered how the streets would look if bikes were a primary mode of transport , and not a tool for just the dedicated few ? When New York City 's transit workers went on strike last December 20-22 , seven million daily bus and subway riders had to find alternate ways to get to work . Despite frigid temperatures , often in the 20s and never above 37 degrees , hundreds of thousands of people pulled out their bicycles . For me , a no-matter-the-weather New York bike commuter , they were welcome company . With the subway gates locked and the buses parked , the city 's daily flow was crippled , and that famous spirit of coopention among New Yorkers began to surface . An estimated 600,000 cyclists took to the streets during the strike , an increase of 500 percent over the usual 120,000 daily riders , according to the advocacy group Transportation Alternatives . The city transportation department counted 11,717 westbound cyclists on the four East River bridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a normal day . Instead of the usual six or so other winter bike commuters I see during my morning spin through Central Park , I saw more than 40 . Even more than usual . New Yorkers obsessed about how to get from point A to point B. In the office , I heard tales of hitching in cars with strangers to pass temporary carpool checkpoints , of rising before dawn to face a two-hour trip , of squeezing into already occupied taxicabs , which turned off their meters and simply charged by the head , and then sat in gridlocked traffic . Some people were absent , avoiding the melee by telecommuting . But those who pedaled seemed to have more positive stories : " It only took me 19 minutes to get here , " said one woman , a marathoner and , now , bike commuter . " It usually takes me 25 by subway . " Now that strike kibitzing has ended and bus stops are again used for something besides locking up , I see fewer bike commuters . Butas spring warms us , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that riding to work is worth it , even when you do n't have to . Sidebar Hail a taxi ? Fahgettaboudit . The fastest way to get around was a bike-any bike . // <p>
