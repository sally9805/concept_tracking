WHAT CAN I SAY ? IT WAS A job , and I was glad to get it . The money was n't great , but I had no skills and nothing to offer beyond a vague feeling that I was meant for something better . My mother knew someone who knew the owner , and I got a message to go along and show myself . I started two days later . Training was minimal . Customers were few in number . <p> I 'd been there six weeks when I saw my first returnee . <p> He must have got off the bus at the far end of town , and it had started to rain on him as he 'd been walking through the center . I saw him coming up the road . The road was called Technology Drive , and it had been built to run north out of town and into the hills . Ours was the only building on it . You walked about two hundred yards to get to us , with open scrub on either side . If you wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing much to look at unless you wanted to see how the weeds had broken up the concrete . <p> He walked with his head down , and with his hands in the pockets of his brown overcoat . The rain was light but he walked as if he was taking a beating . <p> He looked vaguely familiar . But at that point I had n't considered the possibility that any of the people I 'd been dealing with might ever come back . <p> He came in and went straight to the ledge under the window where we kept the boxes of forms . He did n't have to ask for any help . When he brought the paperwork over to the counter , the boxes had been filled in and the waivers were all in order and I 'd little more to do than run through the questionnaire and then take it all through to my boss for his approval . <p> Morley was in his little back office , where he spent most of the days reading old magazines . He had a desk , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pose without slowly collapsing . I think he had a framed picture on the wall but I ca n't for the life of me remember what it was of . " Customer , boss , " I told him , and showed him the papers . <p> He looked them over , and then tilted his chair back a couple of extra degrees so that he could see through the doorway to the main part of the shop . He stared at the waiting man for a moment , then gave me a nod and returned his attention to his reading . Most of his magazines were old technical publications , filled with page after page of fine print . They carried long lists of obsolete gear and they looked about as much fun as telephone directories . <p> I went back to the counter , and worked out the charges on the spreadsheet . The further back in time you wanted to go , the more it cost . Then there were other complicating factors , like body weight and geography . <p> When we 'd sorted out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine . <p> " Booth five , " I told him . <p> He went inside and closed the door . I made all the settings and locked off the switches , and then there was nothing else to do but press the big red button . <p> " Are you ready , sir ? " I called out to him . <p> " Get on with it , " I heard him say . <p> So I got on with it . It was no thrill , just a routine - any buzz had gone out of it very quickly . But something jolted me in that moment as I realized why he 'd seemed just a little bit familiar . It was the target settings that I recognized . I 'd set them before . He 'd been in about twelve days previously and he 'd specified exactly the same destination . <p> But he 'd been at least ten years older then . <p> IT WAS A NOTHING job in a run-down travel bureau in a town in the middle of nowhere . I could have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fast-food franchise , but instead I was sending a small group of losers back in time to relive their mistakes . I know that 's what they did , because the same bunch of people brought us so much in the way of repeat business . <p> There must have been hundreds of bureaux like ours , small-town operations all scraping by as the last of their investors ' capital dwindled . They 'd been set up as a franchise network when the technology had first become available . They were like those long-distance phone places where you buy time at a counter and they assign you a booth while they set up the call ; only here , you paid your money to be sent back to a date and a place of your choice . <p> Anyone could walk in and do it . <p> But only a strange few ever did . <p> The predicted boom had been a bust . I suppose it was like space travel . Full of romance and possibilities until it became achievable , and a matter of doubtful value ever after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over with Morley : <p> He laid his magazine facedown on the desk and said , " I bet there 's something in your life that you 'd change , if you could . " <p> " That 's got to be true of everybody , " I said . " Has n't it ? " <p> " So why do n't you consider going back ? " <p> I suppose the correct answer was that it would be a huge and scary <p> one-way trip , and to make it would involve abandoning the life I now had . And for what ? No certain outcome . <p> But what I said was , " You do n't pay me enough . " <p> " I 'm not talking about the cost of it , " Morley said . " Say I offered you a free one . Would you consider it then " <p> " That would depend if you were serious . " <p> " I 'm serious . You 're hesitating . Why ? " <p> " I have n't thought about it that much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like-agreat idea . But why does n't it feel like a great ideal " <p> " I do n't know , " I said . " It just does n't . " <p> But the more I thought about it , the more I thought I understood . It was obvious that I would never successfully go back and fix everything with Caroline Pocock , the proof being that she despised me so thoroughly in the here and now . Whatever I might try to amend , that was the known outcome . <p> I said , " Does that explain why the only people I see coming through that door seem to be life 's born losers ? " <p> " That 's exactly what they are , " Morley said . " They 're the ones who ca n't accept what became common knowledge after the first few years . Which is that you gamble everything , and nothing changes . Nothing significant , anyway . The status quo is like one big self-regulating ecology . All that happens is that the balance shifts and whatever you do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " How does that work ? " <p> " Nobody knows . The rules are beyond grasping . if you go back to meet yourself , you wo n't be there . The past that you return to may not even be the past you left behind . Whatever you try to alter , somehow it all still comes out the same . Or else it 's different in a way that suits you no better . There 's a whole new branch of fractal mathematics that tries to explain it and what it all comes down to is , there 's an infinite number of ways for something to go wrong and only one way for it to go right . " <p> I said , " So the overall effect is like , when you pee in the swimming pool and nobody notices . " <p> Clearly this was an analogy that had never occurred to him , because he stopped and gave me a very strange look before carrying on . He was n't a healthy-looking man . He had pale eyes and gray-looking skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . He dressed as if he did n't care about his appearance , in clothes that most people would have bagged up and sent to a charity shop . <p> He said , " The people who set these places up thought they 'd make a fortune . Most of them went bust within ten years . The rest of us squeeze a living from the same bunch of hopeless romantics who think they 're the ones who 'll beat the system . " He gestured toward the public area beyond his office door . " You 've seen enough of them by now , " he said . " They keep coming back . They 're older , they 're younger , they 're just in a loop thinking , I almost did it then , I 'll do it for sure next time . Next time , next time . They scrape up the money and they come limping back . They ca n't even see how they 've thrown away the lives that they set out to fix . " <p> That first returnee of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was much older . I mean , seriously . He was recognizable but he looked as if he 'd spent the last couple of decades scavenging for his life in a war zone . Maybe I exaggerate . But not by much . He did n't seem to have washed or shaved in ages . I could smell him from across the room . He just stood there holding onto the wall by the door , as if that last long walk up the road had taken everything out of him . <p> I said , " Hi . " <p> He fixed on me . I wondered if he was drunk , but when he spoke I was fairly sure that he was n't . The messages were just taking their time to get through . <p> He said , " I 'm sorry . I 've come a long way . " <p> " Can I get you anything ? " <p> He shook his head , and then moved over to where the forms were and pulled out a chair . I made a mental note to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with disinfectant and then I realized , with gloom , that the job would fall to me . <p> I watched the man . The one I now thought of as My Repeater . I 'd seen other returnees by now , but he 'd been my first . It was n't so much that he was now old , more that he 'd become old before his time . He looked as if he 'd been sleeping rough , and I wondered how he 'd managed to get his latest stake together . By years of begging and spending nothing by the look of him . <p> He brought the paperwork over . I held my breath . <p> " Just a few last details to get , " I said . <p> " I know , " he said . <p> I went through the usual questionnaire as quickly as I could and when he emptied the money from his pockets onto the counter , I had to force myself to pick it up . The grubby notes were in bundles , and there was a lot of small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coins before touching them . <p> It always had to be cash . Travelers were n't creditworthy . They walked away from their futures when the Big Red Button was pressed , leaving no one to pay off the debts . <p> I said , " Do you want to take a seat while I count this ? " <p> " I 'll just wait here , " he said . <p> And he did , too . He leaned on the counter and watched , with me breathing as shallowly as I could and trying not to rush it so much that I 'd make a mistake and have to do it again . <p> Only days before , I 'd seen him in good health . Now he was a shocking wreck I could n't imagine what he 'd been through and I did n't want to ask . The part that I could n't get my head around was that although the change seemed like a magical stroke that had happened in a matter of days , it was n't . While his younger self had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there , probably heading my way . They were all out there , at more or less the same time - every one of his repeated selves , going over and over the same piece of ground . Never meeting , never overlapping , co-existing in some elaborate choreography managed by forces unknown . Causing no ripples , accomplishing nothing , scraping up their cash and heading right back here . The person he was , and all of the people he would ever be . Fixed . Determined . Tripping over the same moment , again and again and again . <p> I felt a sudden and unaccountable sympathy . It bordered on tenderness , and it was an awkward and unfamiliar feeling ; doubly hard to deal with , considering the scent and the state of him . <p> Lowering my voice so that Morley would n't overhear , I said , " Second chances do n't come cheap , do they ? " <p> " You give it whatever it takes , " he said . <p> He looked so bleak and downcast that it made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea , and I pitched it to Morley . <p> I said , " If we kept one file on each repeater , it would save us having to cover the same ground every time . " <p> " You lazy little bugger , " he said . <p> " I 'm not being lazy , " I protested . 101 thought I was being efficient , " " So somebody comes in here and we face him with a file that shows half a dozen returns that he does n't even know he 's going to make yet . What 's that going to do to him ? " <p> " Stop him from wasting his life " <p> Money said , " Watch my lips . It 's already happened . Nothing 's going to change it . All you can do is add to his misery . " <p> And that was the last of my employee suggestions . <p> I got an hour for lunch , and some days my old school friend Dominic would turn up and we 'd walk out along Technology Drive until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There we 'd sit on a rock and throw stones at bottles until it was time for me to go back . <p> I must have seemed down that day , because Dominic said , " What 's the matter with you ? " <p> " Morley , " I said . <p> " What about him ? " <p> " He 's depressing me . " <p> Dominic knew Morley . Partly because it was a small town and everybody knew everybody , if only indirectly , but also because in my first week Morley had made one of his few front-of-house appearances to tell Dominic to stop hanging around the shop and making conversation with me . <p> He said , " Morley depresses everybody . Even his daughter took her own life rather than listen to his conversation . " <p> This was a surprise . " Seriously ? " I said . <p> " Far as I know . " <p> " When ? " <p> " Years back . When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth . " <p> I did n't know what to say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottle we 'd set up . One of them caught it a glancing blow , and knocked it over . It did n't break , but it fell amongst the remains of countless others that had . <p> " Who says so ? " I wondered aloud as.I went over to set it up again . <p> " My mum , " Dominic said . " She used to know him , in the days when he was a human being . " <p> On the walk down , he told me what he knew of the story , which was very little ... just that Morley 's daughter had written a note and then opened her wrists while stretched out fully clothed in the bath . She 'd cut them lengthways rather than across which , according to Dominic , was proof that she 'd meant it . She 'd been nineteen . No one knew for certain what her reasons were . Morley had burned the note . <p> Technology Drive was like an abandoned airstrip. just being there made you feel guilty and excited with the thrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was as wrecked and overgrown as any Inca road , and in its time had served far less purpose . We picked our way down it , stepping from one tilted block to another . The drains had fallen in and all of the roadside wiring had been dug up and stolen . There was also about seven miles of buried fiberoptic cable that no thief had yet been able to think of a use for . <p> They talked of it as the Boulevard of Failed Business Plans . The cargo  --  cultists ' landing strip for a prosperous future that never came . Crap like that . <p> Nineteen years old . <p> I wondered what she 'd looked like . <p> THE AFTERNOON was uneventful . That evening , I borrowed the car and went out with Dominic . We spent most of it in the Net cafe attached to the local Indian restaurant , and then after I 'd dropped him off at home I contrived to drive past Caroline Pocock 's house a few times , which is no mean trick for a place down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . I did n't know which window was hers , but long ago I 'd picked one at random and by now I 'd convinced myself that it was her bedroom . I stayed there until her father came out in his pajamas and stared at the car and then I took off . <p> It was after one in the morning when I passed the end of Technology Drive and saw lights in the Bureau 's windows . I stopped the car and walked back to the junction , Someone was moving around inside . <p> Burglars ? Looking for what ? There was nothing in the place worth stealing . I did n't get too close because I did n't want to be seen . I stayed back in the darkness and waited for another movement . After about a minute , I saw who was in there . It was Morley . He was n't doing anything much . He was just mooching around . <p> I saw him polish the glass panel in one of the booth doors with his sleeve , I saw him straighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly looked as if he could n't quite bring himself to go home . <p> I could n't imagine why . He lived on his own . There 'd be no one waiting there that he might want to avoid . <p> I did n't get to bed until after two o'clock . I had a restless night . My thinking kept going around in the same circles . If life is lousy and you go back to change it , all that happens is that you fulfill the pattern that delivered your lousy life . Your choices are no choices at all . It seemed all wrong but think about it long enough , and you 'd be scared even to breathe . After all of that , I overslept and had to scramble . <p> I was late getting in . Morley was there already . I do n't think he 'd been there all night . He muttered something sarcastic and went off into the back office . The fact of it was that he could have run the place singlehanded and saved himself the cost of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had me doing was mostly dogsbody work . When I was n't behind the counter I pushed a mop or answered the phone . The technology , though it was getting pretty old , was maintenance-free and the operation of it was idiot-proof . <p> I think it was just that he did n't like to go out there and face the clientele anymore . <p> Around ten-thirty that morning , a taxi drew up outside and this young male of around my own age got out . He was well-dressed and had a sharplooking haircut . You could tell just by looking at him that here was someone from a good family with money , and that he 'd been favored by the education system . Almost everyone from my school slouched , and their mouths hung open in repose . He stood looking the building over as the taxi pulled away , and then he came inside . <p> He spent twenty minutes or more reading through the forms before he brought them over to the counter . <p> He said , apologetically , " You 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out what I 'm supposed to do . " <p> " Sure , " I said , and I started to go through everything with him . He 'd filled in some of the stuff , and he 'd left blank the parts he was n't clear about . <p> This time , I knew it way before I saw the name . <p> " You 've never done this before " I said . <p> " Nope , " he said . I tried not to stare at him . Here , in the midst of his pattern of recycling visits , was the visit that began it all . He was bright , springy , full of confidence . The only giveaway was a dangerous-looking light in his eyes , but it was like the nerve of a bungee-jumper getting ready to go . In his own mind he knew exactly what had to be done , and he was about to step out and do it . <p> I went to get Morley 's approval on the paperwork . My thoughts were racing . <p> Back at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapping out a drumbeat on the counter 's edge with the fingernails of both hands . <p> " Everything all right ? " he said . <p> " Everything 's fine , " I said with forced brightness . <p> " When do I go ? Do I go right now ? " <p> I lowered my voice and said , " Can I say something to you first ? " My repeater stopped his nervous drumming and looked at me ; polite , puzzled , curious . <p> I said , " Walk away from this . Get on with your life . Whatever you think you 're going to change , I can tell you for certain it wo n't work . " " Thanks for the advice , " he said . " But I know exactly what I 've got to do . " <p> So then I did what I 'd been warned against . " Just one moment , " I said . Then I went and got the records of his last few visits . The ones that I 'd witnessed , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on the counter for him to see . <p> He looked at them . Then he looked at me . The light in his eyes was still there , but it had changed . He was n't so certain anymore , and I could see that he was scared . <p> " What 's all this ? " he said . <p> " That 's you , " I said . " That 's your entire life if you do n't walk away . " He stared down at the papers again . They all carried his signature . I 've got him , I was thinking . It was a risk , but it 's working . <p> " Fuck you , " he said . " Do what I 've paid for , or get me your supervisor . " <p> But Morley was already coming out of the back office . " All right , " I started to say , " forget I even spoke . " I could hear the desperation in my voice as I started to backtrack , but it was too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " I thought you people gave a service , " my repeater said , and he pointed toward me . " Since when was it his job to interfere in my private business ? " <p> Morley looked down , and saw the files on the counter . <p> " There 's been a misunderstanding , sir , " he said then , raking them toward him and dropping them under the counter without giving them a second glance . Then he looked at me and said , with a considerable chill factor , " Go and wait in my office . " <p> I went into the back , but I could still hear them . talking . <p> " Booth four , sir , " I heard Morley say . " I hope it works out for you . " " I reckon it will , " I heard the young man say . <p> A couple of minutes later , the young man was on his journey and I was on the carpet . <p> " What do you think you 're playing at ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save him a load of grief . " <p> " He 's got a load of grief . Sometimes it 's just a person 's lot to live it out . " " You did n't see his face when he looked at his file . " <p> " I told you , no files . Did n't you hear me ? " He rammed the point home with his forefinger in my chest , stabbing me with every word . " You do n't .. show .. the clients .. their .. fucking ... files . " <p> " If you 'd only stayed out of it , " I pressed on , " I 'll bet you anything I could have convinced him . I was almost there . I could have rescued a wasted life . " <p> " You know nothing , " Morley said , but I was warming to my theme now ; now that there was no chance of being proved wrong , I was starting to believe that I 'd had control of the situation prior to Money 's interference . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " and then you had to come wading in . " " He 's on rails , " Morley said dismissively . " We 're all on rails . Knowing it wo n't make any difference . " <p> " But what if things do change ? " I argued , and suddenly the doubts that I 'd been unable to articulate all fell into place like jointed plates . <p> " What are you talking about ? " <p> I said , " Maybe things change all the time and we just do n't know it . Maybe your daughter would n't be dead now if you were n't too pigheaded to go back and fix what went wrong . " <p> Bad move . <p> I knew then that I 'd gone too far . I also knew that it was too late to take it back . <p> Morley just stood there and closed his eyes . I could see the whites flickering where the lids did n't quite meet . He took a shuddering breath and swayed a little . I thought for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just that I 'd never seen anyone in the grip of such bone-shaking , overwhelming anger before . <p> He said , " Get out of my place . " <p> He was barely audible . My hands were shaking as I gathered my stuff together and as I was going out of the door that he held open for me , I could n't bring myself to look back at him . <p> I heard him say , " I 've forgiven you an awful lot since you came to work here . I can see now I let you get away with too much . " <p> " Sorry , " I said . <p> " Not sorry enough , " were his last words to me . <p> I could n't eat that night , and I felt so sick about it all that I could n't tell anyone why . It was n't just that I 'd never been fired from a job before . And it was n't because I 'd failed with my repeater , because I 'd been onto a loser there from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show him had been proof in my hands that he 'd continue . I just wished I could have taken back what I 'd said to Morley about his daughter . <p> But there it was . You ca n't change what 's passed . Unless . <p> Unless I was right . For some odd reason I kept thinking about the spreadsheet we used to work out the charges . When you changed one little thing deep down , everything shifted around as a result . It made a whole new picture . <p> Maybe we 're just talking about the spreadsheet of everything . There 's no past as such , there 's just the big " is . " No final , bottom line , just an endless middle . Updating all the time , undergoing constant changes in the always-has-been . Our certainties rewriting themselves from one instant to the next . For every miserable repeater , maybe there are a thousand happy and successful travelers whose journey simply vanished from the record once their misery was removed and the journey became unnecessary . <p> Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid . <p> I know that there are brain-damaged people who live entirely in the moment , whose memories fade in the instant they 're formed . They need a notebook so they can keep checking on who they are , where they live and where they 're from , who all these strangers around them might be . <p> Maybe this whole time thing 's just a magic notebook . And we 're just the readers who believe all that we see . <p> THE NEXT MORNING , I confessed to my mother about losing the job . It was that , or go through the pretense of getting dressed and going out early with no reason . She was n't as surprised as I thought she 'd be , but she asked about my unpaid wages . I had n't even thought about them , and I really did n't feel like facing Morley again . But then when she started to talk about going with me to make sure that I got what I was due , I made hasty arrangements to go back alone . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked in through all the windows but nobody was there . <p> So I went away , and returned late in the afternoon . By then someone had called the police out . Two uniformed officers had turned up in a van , along with a man that I recognized as the owner of a big women 's wear shop in the middle of town . I mean it was a big shop , not that it sold stuff to big women . It was called " Enrico et Nora " and he was Enrico . I did n't know it at the time , but he was Morley 's sleeping partner in the business . The policemen were getting ready to break the door in . <p> I said , " Can I ask what 's going on ? " <p> " It 's bolted on the inside , " Enrico said . " Who are you ? " The police wanted to know who I was as well , so I told them . <p> Then they brought this heavy thing on handles out of the van , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said I could n't follow them inside , so I did . <p> I 'd walked through the same door every working day for the past couple of months , but now it did n't feel right . All the lights were on , even though it was daytime . I was tensed for something awful . I know it may sound melodramatic , but it felt like the kind of scenario that precedes the discovery of a lonely death . <p> One of the officers had his head inside one of the booths . He pulled it out and said , " How do those things work ? " <p> " It takes two people , " I explained . " One to travel and one to operate from the outside . There 's a system so one person ca n't do both . " <p> They started looking in each of the booths , I 'd guess in case Morley was lying in one of them . <p> But I was looking over at the counter . <p> The anglepoise lamp from Morley 's office was standing on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see that there was one of our keycards in the activating slot . Back on the counter , the lamp was positioned in such a way that the edge of its metal shade rested squarely on the Big Red Button . <p> He 'd have had maybe a minute to get himself into the booth as the lamp slowly descended . <p> The settings on the machine meant nothing to me , but I could imagine where they 'd led . I do n't know if he 'd aimed to get there hours before , to prevent the child from killing herself , or months before , to divert her from wanting to . <p> I told them all about it . <p> And even as I was telling them , I looked out through the window . <p> I knew that he could n't have succeeded , of course . I knew it because I lived in a world where Morley 's daughter lay long-dead in her grave and I 'd seen the damaged plaything that loss had made of her father . If he 'd gone back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . But it had . <p> I could see a figure heading up Technology Drive , walking from where the bus had dropped him off . I could n't see his features yet , but I could read the determination in his stride . <p> Next time , his attitude seemed to say . I almost did it then , I 'll do it for sure next time . <p> The police went into the back to look through the papers in Morley 's desk . Enrico went looking for a phone to call his lawyer . I moved around to my usual place behind the counter . <p> And there I waited , to see which of my repeaters it would be . <p> Author Affiliation
