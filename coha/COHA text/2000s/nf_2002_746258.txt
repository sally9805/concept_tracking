What is the role of social studies in facilitating global understanding ? What can we make of the term globalization , which currently dominates many international issues and discussions ? How are other nations dealing with the need to develop truly global citizens ? The world is constantly changing , and social studies must change as well . New issues and themes are present in the world , but the social studies is slow to adapt to those changes . Social studies has remained intent on socialization rather than on critical citizenship and really is quite ethnocentric . To meet the needs of students and face the challenges in the world today and in the future , we must undertake approaches that address global issues . Social studies that will lead ultimately to global social efficacy must enable students to experience a " world of discovery . " Global social efficacy empowers us to analyze issues in the world and society critically and to participate actively in problem solving and decision making for change . Improved global education must include the following topics : <p>  --  Global interdependence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cultural issues <p>  --  Integration in social studies teaching and learning Rationale for Change <p> The National Council for the Social Studies ( NCSS ) provides suggestions for improving the relevance of social studies leading to global awareness . Global connections is one of the thematic strands that NCSS proposes for transforming K-12 social studies ( 1994 ) . Social studies represents a potent force for involving people in self-discovery , an understanding of history , and the promotion of behaviors that are vital for participation as global citizens ( Prasad 1998 ) . Students will gain complete understanding of the world experience only by viewing it from the multiple perspectives of the groups who were and are active participants in it , rather than only from the victor 's point of view ( Banks 1992 ) . <p> Having a global perspective means that students view the world as a planet-wide society and understand the interdependence of human beings ( Evans 1987 ) . To help students achieve the goal of a global perspective for social efficacy , a teacher must develop their knowledge , skills , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation in global society ( White 2000 ) . Loewen ( 1995 ) wrote that a global perspective should prompt students to find creative solutions to international problems . Such integrating themes as conflict , interdependence , diversity , development , interaction , and comparing and contrasting cultures in social studies are approaches that foster global education . <p> Although many nations are struggling with social studies , especially when addressing basic goals , ideas of citizenship , and developing and understanding global perspectives , it is New Zealand that provides an interesting case regarding social studies for social efficacy and global understanding . If we are interested in meaningful integration of global perspectives in social studies , the social studies directions in New Zealand are well worth investigating . New Zealand Social Studies <p> What can we learn from a nation the size of Colorado ? What kind of insight regarding social studies can be gleaned from a country that has a population less than Houston 's ? What kinds of comparisons can we make about social studies in New Zealand and in the United States ? Why listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth is that we can gain much from current trends in social studies education in New Zealand . <p> Social studies in New Zealand is undergoing a considerable transformation , but it is definitely alive and well . Unlike the United States , which remains in the grips of societal debate about even the basic goals of education and social studies , New Zealand has a established a decided direction for social studies . After a history of social studies modeled after the British and Australian systems and focusing on traditional teaching and learning , New Zealand social studies went through several years of soul searching , considering the goals and objectives for social studies . The result is Social Studies in the New Zealand Curriculum ( 1997 ) . <p> The Social Studies in the New Zealand Curriculum suggests that social studies ensure that a few topics be covered in depth , that objectives be expressed as conceptual understandings , that learning activities help students achieve the objectives , that assessment adequately evaluate them , and that the social studies processes be an integral part of the curriculum ( Barr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to ensure a balanced approach to education that is based on student-centered and holistic teaching and learning on one hand and on a structured curriculum with clear goals on the other . <p> The adopted social studies curriculum for New Zealand is designed as a general framework to assist with teaching and learning . The curriculum comprises five social studies strands , three social studies processes , and five perspectives . The perspectives are settings in New Zealand and beyond , essential learnings about New Zealand society , essential skills , and achievement objectives for all levels of schooling . <p> The five social studies strands in the New Zealand curriculum include social organization , culture and heritage , place and environment , time , continuity and change , and resources and economic activities . The focus of the strands is the promotion of global connections , with two general aims tied to each strand and two additional achievement objectives for each level of schooling . For example , the aims for the social organization strand are that students will understand people 's organization into groups and the rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups . <p> The three social studies processes in the New Zealand curriculum include inquiry , values exploration , and social decision making . The general aim for all processes is that students develop skills as they use the social studies processes to learn about society and that that will enable them to participate responsibly in society , thus fostering social efficacy . The processes are integral to the social studies curriculum . Traditionally , they had been generally taught as add-on activities and offered as generic lists , often having little connection to actual teaching and learning ( Case and Wright 1997 ; Barr 1998 ) . <p> A major issue addressed dealt with the inclusion of achievement objectives . The goal of those was to move beyond essentialist perspectives to focus on objectives that allowed students to construct ideas or understandings . The achievement objectives are indicators and are not intended to be mandatory or prescriptive ( Barr , Hunter , Keown 1999 ) . The suggestions are outlined in the curriculum focus on application of understandings to new situations . <p> Unique to the New Zealand social studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the settings in New Zealand and beyond . The five perspectives , which the document states are integral to a balanced social studies program , include bicultural perspectives , multicultural perspectives , gender perspectives , perspectives on current issues , and perspectives on the future . The settings include an understanding of New Zealand and its role in the Pacific , Europe , Asia , and globally . The emphasis on both the five perspectives and settings in New Zealand and beyond is an attempt at providing meaningful connections for social studies education . The particular connections promote the concept of global social efficacy . <p> New Zealand social studies has made great strides with the adoption of Social Studies in the New Zealand Curriculum ( 1997 ) . The idea behind the curriculum document is to provide a framework mandated by the Ministry of Education that not only provides consistency to social studies but also moves the discipline away from traditional approaches toward a global social efficacy . The inclusion of five general strands suggests a thematic approach to all of the New Zealand social studies curricula . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strands also suggests a concentration of social skills necessary for knowledge construction and application . <p> As with much of what is occurring in education today , achievement and accountability for essential learnings and objectives often drive curriculum , instruction , and assessment approaches . Those are important concerns to investigate as New Zealand continues its transformation of social studies . Elementary Social Studies <p> The very nature of New Zealand classroom and school structure facilitates social studies knowledge , skills , and values exploration . Upon first inspection of elementary and primary schools and classrooms in New Zealand , one immediately finds a student-friendly atmosphere . There are no barbed wire fences or barred entrances . The schools are designed in an open manner with courtyards , large classrooms , and common areas . They open early and close late . Parents take children to their classrooms and are encouraged to stay and interact until time for school to begin . The pattern applies to after-school pick-ups . Children are able to engage in a variety of activities . They can play on the playground , draw , read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Classrooms are bright and lively places with artwork , music instruments , and at least two computers . The children have teatime in the morning for about twenty minutes . During that time , they eat a snack , play inside , or play outside . They follow a similar routine for lunch , which lasts about an hour . Schools do not have lunchrooms , so depending on the weather , the students have a picnic and play or eat in their classrooms . Each day they also participate in formal physical education classes , art , and music . <p> The national curriculum mandates the integration of social studies , science , technology , art , music , and physical education into elementary teaching and learning . Units are often integrated around a social studies or science theme . Standardized testing exists in New Zealand elementary and primary schools , but it does not drive the curriculum . For schools to attain high scores , in competition with other schools , is not the ultimate goal . There seems to be a conscious effort to ensure that high-stakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States is seen as a negative example . <p> Most children often take their shoes and socks off in New Zealand classrooms and are encouraged to be comfortable while learning . Most classrooms have couches , beanbag chairs , rugs and carpeted areas , and pillows for the children . Social processes , including problem solving , decision making , values exploration , and inquiry , are central to the curriculum and receive as much emphasis as any knowledge-based content . New Zealand children seem genuinely excited to go to school , and they find elementary and primary classrooms inviting places where " kids are allowed to be kids . " They are encouraged to play , create , and experiment in their social and intellectual development , facilitating the concept of social efficacy . Technology and Social Studies <p> Successfully integrating technology into social studies classes is a vital issue facing social studies educators in New Zealand , as it is in the United States . In theory , many educators support the relatively new push to integrate technology into the schools . They understand that technology can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cultures they could not experience before . Technology has the potential to facilitate the development of decision-making , problem-solving , and data-processing skills and communication capabilities , despite its limited research base ( Berson 1996 ) . Unfortunately and all too often , problems occur when teachers are presented the new technology as a limited package that they are expected to implement and then left to battle alone to do it effectively . <p> We have heard similar comments about the integration of technology in schools . And if the truth were known , New Zealand social studies teachers seem to be quite adamant in their indictment of that movement , at least in their classroom actions . Technology is here , has been here in some form or another for a while , and will stay ; but presently , social studies classrooms reflect little meaningful integration . Technology may even provide the educational epiphany some are wishing for , and it does offer much to a social studies that has been stagnant . Integrating technology throughout all levels of social studies education is vital if we are interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies ( Hope 1996 ) . <p> As Hope ( 1996 ) stated , social studies in our schools is dominated by tradition ; students participate in traditional endeavors focusing on direct instruction and a curriculum designed decades ago . The question is whether this traditional arrangement is helping to develop students who can think for themselves and participate as responsible citizens in a changing world . The idea that effective social studies is based only on knowledge transmission is inappropriate ( Soler and Trewen 1998 ) . Where is the transformative and empowering potential within social studies education ? And what is the role of technology in meeting that potential ? <p> In social studies education , the successful integration of technology and constructivism can lead to a powerful social studies that includes meaningful , integrative , value-based , challenging , and active curriculum and instruction ( National Council for the Social Studies 1994 ) . Integrating that approach into the curriculum will facilitate the development of an empowering and transformative social studies . If we in social studies agree with the idea of developing powerful social studies , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been done . <p> The merging of technology and constructivism offers much hope for the future of social studies education . Constructivism encourages a more student-centered focus to teaching and learning , whereby students are responsible for making sense of their own learning , with the help of perceptive teachers and the use of powerful strategies ( Brooks and Brooks 1993 ) . A constructivist orientation to social studies education is important if we are to encourage students to develop their problem-solving and critical-thinking skills and apply , analyze , synthesize , and evaluate knowledge , skills , and attitudes . <p> The promotion of the social studies goal of developing informed citizens who not only understand their world but also possess critical-thinking skills , such as reflective inquiry , values analysis , social problem solving , and decision making , can be enhanced through the integration of technology in schools and classrooms to achieve the ultimate goal of civic efficacy . Sewell and Brown ( 1999 ) suggest the following eight principles to serve as guidelines for using technology in New Zealand social studies : <p>  --  Establish cooperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflective inquiry <p>  --  Provide scaffolded instruction <p>  --  Provide authentic problem-solving opportunities <p>  --  Integrate learning and assessment <p>  --  Develop a student-centered learning space <p>  --  Ensure a supportive social culture Critical Constructivism <p> A critical constructivist approach works well with technology applications and is a vital component in developing global classrooms , thus opening up a " world of discovery . " Constructivism really comes down to the teacher 's building on what the students already know and encouraging them to become more responsible for their own learning , while integrating the essential skills of critical thinking and problem solving . Students who can think for themselves and look critically at societal problems will find the world a more exciting and challenging place to live . The following critical constructivist model can be integrated into a global classroom that integrates technology : modeling and applying , reflecting , involving students actively , and developing a community of learners . Modeling and Applying <p> Modeling and applying of constructivist lessons , activities , and environments by the instructor and students are vital to developing meaningful social studies and facilitating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any social studies endeavor include active learning , student-centered approaches , variety , creativity , choice , nontraditional curriculum , humor , critical thinking and problem solving , reflection , and process . The modeling and applying of technology should be the major focus here , with each class modeled as a constructivist classroom , integrating the above themes . Students must be able to express their natural inquisitive nature , instead of being passive recipients of facts . Reflecting <p> A particular goal in the design of social studies curriculum is the development of critical thinking and problem solving . Teachers in their classrooms can achieve that by promoting students ' relationships for individual and shared reflection . Every activity and assignment should have a reflection component , with shared activities and projects that encourage critique and further reflection . That can be accomplished through assignments to individuals and small groups and in discussions with the whole class . Discussion boards , chats , and e-mail can provide opportunities for reflection and communication among students and between the instructor and students . <p> A passive and dull classroom only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety of strategies facilitates learning as a process of discovery . Engaging a student in learning through dialogue and reflection with fellow students , the teacher , and others enhances his or her journey to knowledge and competency . Involving the Students Actively <p> An essential component of a constructivist global classroom is the active involvement of the class in student-centered activities . Projects for a class in which the students are responsible for constructing their own learning can illustrate the priority of active learning . The instructor can model a project or present previously completed student projects to the class , which is divided into small or large groups . After discussion and reflection , the class chooses the projects to complete , sets priorities for the projects , and may add projects of their own design . Possible projects might include technology applications , simulations , community-based activities , or problem solving and other student-centered active learning activities related to global themes . Technology applications readily lend themselves to active student involvement . Developing a Community of Learners <p> The use of modeling and the application of discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that , the social studies instructor lays the foundation for a classroom comprising a community of learners . The classroom environment and structure must include humor , choice , variety , challenge , adaptation , and nontraditional curriculum and instruction in social studies . A sense of community within a classroom goes a long way in promoting a shared sense of civic competence and joy of discovery . <p> Our society seems to be suffering from lack of community . To counteract that , schools need to play a more prominent role in developing the skills necessary for cooperation , compromise , and progress for the good of all . Social studies should lead in that process because the goal of civic competence also includes that of community . Conclusion <p> Social studies for global social efficacy in New Zealand is alive and well . What makes New Zealand unique is its emphasis on social studies perspectives , settings , and processes , and the concerted effort to integrate social studies into teaching and learning on a daily basis . Such efforts enable New Zealand teachers to counter the traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies ( Hunter 1999 ) . <p> Skelton ( 1997 ) wrote of a desperate need to transform social studies to encourage respect for different perspectives as a preparation for living in an increasingly pluralistic , fragmented , and rapidly changing world . Hope ( 1996 ) suggested powerful approaches that are meaningful , integrative , value-based , challenging , and involve active teaching and learning . Strategies that use technology and critical constructivist approaches have been integrated into New Zealand social studies classrooms to facilitate the transformation . In concentrating on the goal to promote the development of citizens of the world , New Zealand social studies has come a long distance . Our focus on social studies curricula that promote the concepts of critical social efficacy and global citizenry will enhance our voyage through a world of discovery . <p> Key words : constructivism and technology in social studies , New Zealand social studies , technology and social studies <p>
