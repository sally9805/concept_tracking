<p> It was the sort of banter that would make a mother recoil . <p> In the alley behind the U.S. Marines recruiting office in Duluth , a small knot of young men tested themselves on a pull-up bar and coarsely talked about their possible future . <p> Joseph Ying , a high school senior from Duluth who is still in braces , played down the chances of dying in combat in Iraq . He reasoned that , yes , thousands have died in combat , but many thousands more have survived . The statistical logic did n't sway everyone . <p> " Dude , a lot of people die there , " said C.J. Janecek , 20 , from Buford . <p> Ying maintained his point . <p> " I do n't think anybody goes in thinking they 're going to die , " said another , Andrew Custer of Grayson . <p> They seemed to talk about the war and their potential roles in it as an abstraction , perhaps because it was too far away to be grasped as a possibility , perhaps to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , building up the muscles and endurance they 'll need to survive boot camp and eventually to serve their country . <p> Three of them , Custer , Janecek and Joseph Hwangbo , boarded a bus Monday that took them to boot camp at Parris Island , S.C. , their home for the next 13 weeks . It 's possible that within a year , they could see action in Iraq . <p> While polls show the war is growing in unpopularity , the flow of recruits signing up to become Marines has not stopped in Gwinnett County . The recruiting office , near Gwinnett Place mall , is on pace to match the roughly 120 it sent off to boot camp each of the past two fiscal years . <p> " It 's not a surprise , " said Staff Sgt. Mitchell Hamilton , who has worked at the recruiting office for three years . " Gwinnett County is a good area to recruit . This area , the kids , they kind of want that . They want someone to give them a kick in the butt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady , according to Lt. Staci Reidinger , a spokeswoman for the Marines . From October 2005 to September 2006 , 896 men and women went to boot camp from the Atlanta recruiting station , the highest total in at least five years . <p> " Some of them actually say , ' I want to go out there , ' " Hamilton said . <p> Spokesmen for the Army and Air Force reported similar stability . Numbers for the Navy could not be obtained . <p> Hwangbo is a 2006 graduate of Norcross High School . He loves football , graduated from Norcross with a 3.0 grade-point average and has an irrepressible grin , even when he 's grinding out pull-ups and stomach crunches . <p> " I even told him that , " said Paul Kong of Lilburn , a friend . " ' I 've never seen you not smile . ' He 's always like that . " <p> While still in high school , Hwangbo talked with a recruiter and considered joining after graduation . But he decided against it . He said he was persuaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he had worked since he was a junior . He told Hwangbo not to go , that it would be dangerous and that he was risking his life . <p> Hwangbo enrolled last fall at Georgia Perimeter College with the idea of becoming a pharmacist . At the same time , a friend of his joined the Marines , which caused him again to consider enlisting . He visited with Hamilton and then took about a week to think it over , he said . <p> His family  --  his parents and his two younger sisters  --  was against it , as were many friends . They were fearful that he would " get sent to Iraq , get killed , all that stuff , " Hwangbo said . <p> Hwangbo decided he wanted to be a Marine . He said his reasons were to serve his country , to take a break from college , to travel and to experience life in the military . <p> Before leaving for Parris Island , he watched the news reports of casualties in Iraq and admitted it worried him . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about dying or getting wounded , " he said . " I have to stay focused , be motivated . I ca n't really let negative aspects influence me . I 've got to keep a positive mind . " <p> Custer and Janecek shared similar mind-sets . Janecek , who graduated from North Gwinnett High School in 2005 , wants to train for reconnaissance missions . His girlfriend did n't want him to go . <p> " My real reason for joining is I want to be the best I can be , " he said . He is aware that he could become a casualty . <p> " If that happens , then I did n't do my job , " he said . <p> Custer , 19 , moved to Grayson from the Washington area last fall . He said his mother " was n't too thrilled " with his decision to join the Marines . Mitchell , the recruiter , said would-be recruits often want to join , but their parents refuse to let them . <p> Custer 's parents made sure he was aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Custers knew died in Iraq  --  and respected his decision . Andrew had been interested in the military since he was a boy and participated in the Young Marines program . <p> " It 's kind of like a once-in-a-lifetime experience , " he said . " The training and education you get , you ca n't get anywhere else . " <p> Gail Custer , Andrew 's mother , said that she and her husband do not support the reasons why the U.S. is fighting in Iraq . But she and her husband are proud of their son . Andrew co-captained his high school football team and is the sort , his mother said , who will drop whatever he 's doing if a friend needs help . <p> " But I 'm a mother , " she said . " I carried him for nine months . I 'm scared . I 'm praying with all my being that he does not end up in Iraq . " <p> If all goes according to schedule , Custer , Janecek and Hwangbo will graduate from boot camp in May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialized training . While Janecek has his eye on reconnaissance , Custer and Hwangbo are interested in field artillery . They could be ready for deployment by fall . <p> It will be a long way from pull-ups in an alley in Duluth . <p> " I 'm not afraid , " Hwangbo said . " Someone 's got to do it .
