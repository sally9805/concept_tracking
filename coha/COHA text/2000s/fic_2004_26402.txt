Dead Ringer Chapter One Bennie Rosato had waited for more than a hundred jury verdicts in her career , but the waiting never got easier . The courtroom was empty , the air still . Bennie could hear the clock ticking on the paneled wall , but it could have been her sense of drama . She was sitting next to her client , Ray Finalil , who was gnawing his cuticles . If they lost this trial , Ray 's company would have to pay three million dollars in damages . Three million bucks buys a lot of cuticles . Bennie set aside her own case of nerves to cheer him up . " Yo , Ray . How do you stop a lawyer from drowning ? " " How ? " " Take your foot off his head . " Ray did n't smile . His gaze remained fixed on the vacant jury box , with its black leather chairs swiveled in different directions . The jury had been charged on the law this morning and they 'd been out deliberating all day . That meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk . To Bennie , that was as good as married . " Okay , no more jokes , " she said . " Tell me about your son 's baseball game . I 'll pretend I do n't know about the home run or the catch at third base . " " Second base . " " See ? " Ray 's chin dropped to his hand . His brown eyes were bloodshot from three weeks of sleepless nights and his cheeks hollow from the ten pounds he 'd shed during the trial , even though he was completely innocent . Being a defendant was no-win ; if you lost , you paid the plaintiff , and if you won , you paid your lawyer . This was known as the American Rule . Only Americans tolerate law without justice . " Look , Ray , we do n't have to stay here . I have my cell phone , and the deputy clerk has my number . How about we take a field trip ? We can go see the Liberty Bell . It 's only a block away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your land , Ray . This land is my land . " " No . " " Come on , it 'll do you good to go out and walk around . " Bennie rose , stretched , and took a personal inventory . She thought she was good-looking for a lawyer , even though she stood six feet tall and her proportions were positively Amazonian . Her khaki suit was still pressed and her white Gap shirt fairly clean . Her long , disobedient blond hair had been piled into a twist with a tortoiseshell barrette , but no makeup maximized the blue of her eyes or minimized the crow's-feet at their corners . An old boyfriend had told her that her mouth was generous , but she suspected it was a sneaky way of saying she had a big mouth . At the moment , it was shaped into a sympathetic frown . " You do n't wan na take a walk ? " " When do you think they 'll come back ? " Ray did n't have to explain who " they " were . The jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . At least the stretch had shaken off some of her stress . She could n't remember the last time she 'd exercised . This trial had consumed every available minute for the past two months , but her law firm needed the dough . The slump in the economy had hit lawyers , too , and people had stopped suing each other . Could world peace be far behind ? " I ca n't take another day of this . You sure they 'll come back today ? " " Positive . This is a simple fraud case , in federal court only through the miracle of diversity jurisdiction . And Thursday is a good day for juries to go out . They get it over with if they come back today , then they go home and make it a three-day weekend . They wo n't go to work on a Friday after jury duty . " " How do you know ? " " Trial wisdom . The elders pass it down in a secret ceremony . We call it the bar exam to fool gringos like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for so long ? " Ray rubbed his forehead with leftover fingernails . He looked older than his fifty-one years , and oddly , he 'd become more nervous as the trial wore on , not less . Ray was n't a lover or a fighter . He was an accountant . " A day is nothing . We just had a fifteen-day trial with one hundred twenty-six exhibits and twenty-eight witnesses . You want them back sooner ? " Bennie pointed to the empty jury box . " Keep watching those chairs . It works every time . " Suddenly , the paneled door next to the dais opened and the deputy clerk entered . He was tall and fit , and his polyester blazer made an officially swishy sound when he walked . When Bennie realized he was heading for her , she rose . " They back ? " she asked , her heart beginning to thump , but the deputy clerk shook his head . " They got a question . They sent a note . Court 's in session in five minutes . Plaintiff still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bennie answered , and as soon as the deputy clerk took off down the aisle , Ray jumped up and clutched her sleeve . " What does he mean , a question ? The jury has a question ? What question ? " " Relax . Sit down . " Bennie unpeeled Ray 's fingers and eased him down into his chair . " The judge is coming out to read us the question . Then we  --  " " A question ? How typical is that ? I do n't understand . What does he mean , a question ? " " It happens from time to time . The jury sends the judge a question about the evidence or the law . It 's nothing to be  --  " " I mean , what do they have to know ? " Ray raked his free hand through his thinning hair . At the beginning of this trial he had looked like a Chia Pet . Okay , maybe that was an exaggeration . " Who said they could ask questions ? Why do they get to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay cool . Curtain 's up . " Bennie gestured behind him , where the courtroom had come abruptly to life ...
