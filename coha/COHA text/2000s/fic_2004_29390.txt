my block Ma says it 's a good thing we ca n't see too far down the road , ' cause we 'd never take the journey . I found this true -- and my journey was filled to the brim with trouble . It all started the day Jacob walked headfirst into a lamppost on my block . " Judy 's doing a dance on second base ! " Harold yelled from the pitcher 's mound . Second base was an imaginary square next to Mr. Johnson 's front tire , and the pitcher 's mound was a sewer cap . I knew it was stupid to play stickball in bare feet . It was a blistering afternoon in July , and my toes felt like sausages on a hot griddle . " Time-out , " I called to my friends . " I need shoes . " I ran inside , grabbed my Keds , and plopped down on the stoop to tie my laces . Harold 's Doberman pinscher , Bruiser , had been watching our game , and during this time-out he lifted his leg and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then he scratched Bruiser behind the ear and said , " Good boy . " Great , I thought . Now I 'd have to breathe hot asphalt mixed with dog pee while we finished our game . I closed my eyes for a minute and thought about the Catskill Mountains . In just a few weeks I 'd be running barefoot in the cool grass and breathing in wild honeysuckle . " Come on , Judy . We ai n't got all day , " Harold said . His hands were on his hips , and his jaws chomped hard on a piece of gum . " All right , all right . " I think the only reason I put up with Harold was that he let us use his Spalding ball . It was 1944 , and the war was still on . Rubber was scarce and Spaldings were hard to come by . I hopped off the porch , and that 's when I sawJacob Jacobsen walking toward us , his face turned down and his hands in his pockets . I thought it was strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all knew Jacob ; he was Norwegian , like us , and we saw him at school and at church . But in Bay Ridge , Brooklyn , your block was your territory -- outsiders were not really welcome . If you hung out with other kids , it was on common ground like Eighth Avenue , the schoolyard , or Sunset Park . He continued along , avoiding our stares . Annette got up to bat , and after she slammed a home run , Jacob bashed his head right into the lamppost . We stopped our game and watched as he doubled over and let out a huge moan . I took a few steps in his direction while everyone else laughed . Jacob looked up and fixed his eyes on me . He opened his mouth to say something , but then he turned and bolted down the street . I looked at my friends . " Gee , that 's really nice , " I said . " Jacob smashes his head , and you guys laugh . " " Come on , Judy , we could n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street . " What was he doing coming up here anyway ? " Olaf reenacted the scene . " Uh . . . which way did he go , George , which way did he go ? " Then he boinked his head into an invisible pole . " Maybe he was drunk like his old man , " Harold said , pretending to put a liquor bottle to his lips . My face burned and a lump swelled in my throat . " Shut up , Harold ! " I said . " Annette , let 's get out of here . I 've got ten cents -- I 'll buy you an ice cream . " I grabbed her arm and yanked her down the street . Two nickels clinked together in my pocket . I had retrieved them from the gutter that morning with a wad of old bubble gum pressed onto the end of my stickball bat . " I 'm sick and tired of those boys , " I said . " Well , I do n't see what the big deal was , " Annette said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her and sighed . Annette and I had been best friends for most of our thirteen years , but there was something different about us -- deep down where you could n't see . Once , when I had spent an entire morning in Ma 's little garden , sketching some lily of the valley , I picked a cluster and showed it to Annette . She said , " Yeah ? So ? Little dinky flowers . Come on , Judy , let 's go to the schoolyard and play handball or something . " I did n't bother to show her my sketch . I thought about Jacob as we walked to the candy store . When Jacob and I were little , our mothers would meet at the ice cream parlor ; they 'd buy us malteds and then talk over coffee . Afterward , we would run along Eighth Avenue , jumping over cellar doors , while the two of them shopped in the Norwegian stores . When we got older , we drifted apart . We each had our own set of friends and we did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would whisper things to Pa and say what a shame it all was . But a few months before , I 'd discovered the truth about my own family . It had happened when Pa was away on his tugboat and I was snooping around in Ma 's closet . Seeing Jacob made me think about this , and I did n't like it one bit . I 'd been trying so hard to forget . From the Hardcover edition .
