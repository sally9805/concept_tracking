Americans // Tuesday , October 16 , 1962 , 11:50 a.m. // The Central Intelligence Agency ? s chief photo interpreter hovered over the president ? s shoulder . Arthur Lundahl held a pointer in his hand , ready to reveal a secret that would bring the world to the edge of nuclear war . // The secret was buried in three black-and-white photographs pasted to briefing boards hidden in a large black case . The photographs had been shot from directly overhead , evidently from a considerable distance , with the aid of a very powerful zoom lens . On superficial inspection , the grainy images of fields , forests , and winding country roads seemed innocuous , almost bucolic . One of the fields contained tubelike objects , others oval-shaped white dots neatly lined up next to one another . John F. Kennedy would later remark that the site could be mistaken for " a football field . " After examining the photographs earlier that morning , his brother Bobby had been unable to make out anything more than " the clearing of a field for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // To help the president understand the significance of the photos , Lundahl had labeled them with arrows pointing to the dots and blotches , along with captions reading " ERECTOR LAUNCHER EQUIPMENT , " " MISSILE TRAILERS , " and " TENT AREAS . " He was about to display the briefing boards when there was a commotion outside the door . A four-year-old girl burst into one of the most heavily guarded rooms in the White House . // The heads of the fourteen most powerful men in the United States swiveled to the doorway as Caroline Kennedy ran toward her father , babbling excitedly : " Daddy , daddy , they won ? t let my friend in. " // The somber-looking men in dark suits were used to such intrusions . Their frowns dissolved into smiles as the president got up from his leather-upholstered seat and led his daughter back toward the door of the Cabinet Room . // " Caroline , have you been eating candy ? " // No reply . The president smiled . // " Answer me . Yes , no , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few seconds , his arm draped around her shoulders . When Kennedy returned , his expression had again become grave . He took his place at the center of the long table beneath the presidential seal , his back to the Rose Garden . He was flanked on either side by his secretary of state and secretary of defense . Facing him across the table were his brother , his vice president , and his national security adviser . Behind them stood a small bronze bust of Abraham Lincoln , flanked by some model sailing ships . Above the fireplace to the right was the celebrated Gilbert Stuart portrait of a powdered and bewigged George Washington . // The thirty-fifth president of the United States called the meeting to order . // Kennedy seemed preternaturally calm to the other men in the room as he listened to the evidence of Kremlin duplicity . In secrecy , while insisting they would never contemplate such a thing , the Soviet leaders had installed surface-to-surface nuclear missiles on Cuba , less than a hundred miles from American shores . According to the CIA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of hitting much of the eastern seaboard . Once armed and ready to fire , they could explode over Washington in thirteen minutes , turning the capital into a scorched wasteland. // Lundahl took the briefing boards out of his bag and laid them on the table . He used his pointer to direct the president ? s attention to a canvas-covered missile trailer next to a launcher erector . Seven more missile trailers were parked in a nearby field . // " How do you know this is a medium-range ballistic missile ? " asked the president . His voice was clipped and tense , betraying a boiling anger beneath the calm . // " The length , sir . " // " The what ? The length ? " // " The length of it , yes . " // CIA experts had spent the last thirty-six hours poring over thousands of reconnaissance photographs of the hills and valleys of western Cuba . They had discovered telltale cables connecting one of the tubelike objects to the nearby oval-shaped splotch , and had used a revolutionary new computer device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 621 comparator  --  to measure its length . The tubes turned out to be sixty-seven feet long . Missiles of identical length had been photographed at military parades in Red Square in Moscow . // The president asked the obvious question : when would the missiles be ready to fire ? // The experts were unsure . That would depend on how soon the missiles could be mated with their nuclear warheads . Once mated , they could be fired in a couple of hours . So far , there was no evidence to suggest that the Soviets had moved the warheads to the missile sites . If the warheads were present , one would expect to see some kind of secure storage facility at the missile sites , but nothing was visible . // " There is some reason to believe the warheads aren ? t present and hence they are not ready to fire , " said Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara . The computerlike brain of the former head of the Ford Motor Company clicked away furiously , calculating the chances of a surprise attack . He believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Joint Chiefs of Staff disagreed . General Maxwell Taylor had parachuted into Normandy during World War II , and had commanded Allied forces in Berlin and Korea . It fell to him to point out the risks of delay . The Soviets could be in a position to fire their missiles " very quickly . " Most of the infrastructure was already in place . " It ? s not a question of waiting for extensive concrete pads and that sort of thing . " // The president ? s advisers were already dividing into doves and hawks . // Kennedy had received an initial intelligence briefing earlier that morning . His national security adviser , McGeorge Bundy , had knocked on the door of his bedroom , on the second floor of the White House , shortly after 8:00 a.m . The president was propped up in bed , in pajamas and dressing gown , reading the morning newspapers . As often happened , he was annoyed by a page-one headline in The New York Times . On this particular morning , his exasperation was directed at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwritten convention of former presidents refraining from publicly criticizing the current occupant of the Oval Office . // EISENHOWER CALLS PRESIDENT WEAK ON FOREIGN POLICY //  --  // Denounces " Dreary Record , " Challenging Statements by Kennedy on Achievements //  --  // HE SEES SETBACK TO U.S. // As Bundy described the latest U-2 mission over Cuba , Kennedy ? s irritation with Ike was replaced by a burning anger toward his Cold War nemesis . Over the past two years , he and Nikita Khrushchev had been engaged in a very public game of nuclear oneupmanship . But Kennedy thought he had an understanding with the mercurial Soviet premier . Khrushchev had sent word through intermediaries that he would do nothing to embarrass the U.S. president politically before the midterm congressional elections , which were exactly three weeks away . // News that the Soviets were constructing missile bases on Cuba could hardly have come at a worse time . During the 1960 presidential election , Kennedy had used Cuba as a stick to beat the Republicans , accusing the Eisenhower government of doing nothing to prevent Fidel Castro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist satellite . " Now that the Democrats were in power , the political roles were reversed . Republican politicians were seizing on reports of a Soviet military buildup on Cuba to denounce Kennedy for weakness and fecklessness . Just two days earlier , Kennedy had sent Bundy out on nationwide television to knock down a claim by the Republican senator from New York , Kenneth B. Keating , that the Soviets would soon be able " to hurl rockets into the American heartland " from their Caribbean outpost . // Kennedy ? s immediate reaction on learning from Bundy that Khrushchev had double-crossed him was to sputter , " He can ? t do this to me . " An hour later , he walked into the office of his appointments secretary , Kenny O ? Donnell , and announced glumly , " Ken Keating will probably be the next president of the United States . " // Determined to keep the information secret as long as possible , Kennedy decided to stick to his regular schedule , acting as if nothing was amiss . He showed off Caroline ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chatted amiably for half an hour with a Democratic congressman , and presided over a conference on mental retardation . It was not until nearly noon that he managed to break away from his ceremonial duties and meet with his top foreign policy advisers . // Kennedy conceded that he was mystified by Khrushchev . Alternately ingratiating and boorish , friendly and intimidating , the metalworker turned superpower leader was unlike any other politician he had ever encountered . Their single summit meeting  --  in Vienna , in June 1961  --  had been a brutal experience for Kennedy . Khrushchev had treated him like a little boy , lecturing him on American misdeeds , threatening to take over West Berlin , and boasting about the inevitable triumph of communism . Most shocking of all , Khrushchev did not seem to share his alarm about the risks of nuclear war , and how it could be triggered by miscalculations on either side . He spoke about nuclear weapons in a casual , offhand kind of way , as simply one more element in the superpower competition . If the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . " // " Roughest thing in my life , " Kennedy had told James Reston of The New York Times , after it was all over . " He just beat the hell out of me . " Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was contemptuous of his boss ? s performance . " Khrushchev scared the poor little fellow dead , " he told his cronies . British prime minister Harold Macmillan , who met with Kennedy shortly after he left Vienna , was only slightly more sympathetic . He thought that the president had been " completely overwhelmed by the ruthlessness and barbarity of the Russian Chairman . " For the first time in his life Kennedy had met a man " who was impervious to his charm , " Macmillan noted later . " It reminded me in a way of Lord Halifax or Neville Chamberlain trying to hold a conversation with Herr Hitler . " // Part of the problem lay in Kennedy ? s own miscalculations as president . The biggest mistake of all was the Bay of Pigs . In April 1961 , four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cuba by fifteen hundred CIA-trained Cuban exiles . But the operation was disastrously planned and executed . Castro mounted a vigorous counterattack , trapping the exiles in an isolated beachhead . Anxious to conceal official American involvement as much as possible , Kennedy refused to order U.S. ships and planes stationed just offshore to come to the rescue of the outnumbered invaders , most of whom ended up in Castro ? s jails . As Kennedy later confessed to Reston , his superpower rival had no doubt concluded that " I ? m inexperienced . Probably thinks I ? m stupid . Maybe most important , he thinks that I had no guts . " The perception of an inexperienced leader with no guts was one that he had been struggling to reverse ever since . // The news from Cuba reinforced Kennedy ? s impression of Khrushchev as a " fucking liar . " He complained to his brother that the Soviet leader had behaved like " an immoral gangster . . . not as a statesman , not as a person with a sense of responsibility . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely step up U-2 reconnaissance of the island . Military options ranged from an air strike targeted on the missile sites alone to an all-out invasion . General Taylor warned that it would probably be impossible to destroy all the missiles in a single strike . " It ? ll never be a hundred per cent , Mr. President . " Any military action was likely to escalate quickly to an invasion . The invasion plan called for as many as a hundred and fifty thousand men to land in Cuba a week after the initial air strikes . In the meantime , the Soviets might be able to launch one or two nuclear missiles against the United States . // " We ? re certainly going to do option number one , " Kennedy told his aides grimly , referring to the air strike . " We ? re going to take out those missiles . " // Tuesday , October 16 , 2:30 p.m. // Robert Kennedy still had an angry glint in his eye later that afternoon when he met the men in charge of America ? s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . He was determined to make clear the president ? s " dissatisfaction " with Operation Mongoose , which had been under way for a year , achieving virtually nothing . Countless acts of sabotage had been planned , but none had been carried out successfully . Fidel and his bearded revolutionaries were still in power , inflicting daily humiliations on the United States . // Officials from the CIA , the Pentagon , and the State Department were arrayed in a semicircle in front of the attorney general . A fresh assortment of his children ? s watercolors decorated the walls , along with standard-issue government art . One of the documents on the untidy , paper-littered desk was a two-page memorandum captioned " secret mongoose " with the latest ideas for fomenting an insurrection inside Cuba . It had been put together by the CIA in response to prodding from the Kennedy brothers to be much more " aggressive . " RFK nodded approvingly as he glanced through the list : // * Demolition of a railroad bridge in Pinar del R ? o province ; // * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // * Mine the approaches to major Cuban harbors ; // * Set an oil tanker afire outside Havana or Matanzas ; // * Incendiary attacks against oil refineries in Havana and Santiago . // The attorney general title masked Bobby ? s true role in government , which was closer to that of deputy president . His extracurricular responsibilities included heading a secret committee known as the Special Group ( Augmented ) , whose goal was to " get rid of " Castro and " liberate " Cuba from Communist domination . The addition of the president ? s brother to the group  --  signified by the cryptic word " Augmented "  --  was a way of emphasizing its importance to the rest of the bureaucracy . Soon after taking personal control of Operation Mongoose in November 1961 , Bobby had decreed that " the Cuban problem carries top priority in the U.S. government . No time , money , effort , or manpower is to be spared . " By coincidence , he had arranged a long-scheduled review of covert action plans against Cuba the very day that Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his words carefully as he addressed the Special Group . Half the officials in the room were unaware of the latest developments , and the president had stressed the need for total secrecy . But it was difficult for him to conceal his anger as he talked about " the change in atmosphere in the United States government during the last twenty-four hours . " Frustrated by the lack of " push " in getting on with acts of sabotage , he announced that he planned to devote " more personal attention " to Mongoose . To accomplish this , he would meet with the Mongoose operational team every morning at 0930 until further notice . // For Bobby , the appearance of Soviet missiles in the western hemisphere was not simply a political affront ; it was a personal affront . He was the emotional member of the family , as rough and intense as his brother was smooth and calm . JFK had been humiliated once again by Castro and Khrushchev , and RFK was determined to redress the insult . He was extraordinarily competitive  --  even by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longest to nurse a grudge . " Everybody in my family forgives , " the family patriarch , Joseph Kennedy , Sr. , had once remarked . " Except Bobby . " //
