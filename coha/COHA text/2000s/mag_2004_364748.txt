One of the first things that strike foreigners visiting the U.S. is that the rich tend to be skinny and the poor fat . Studies bear this out . The less money you have in America , the likelier you are to be overweight . One in 4 adults below the poverty level is obese , compared with 1 in 6 in households with an income of $67,000 or more . For minorities , poverty has an even heavier effect : obesity strikes 1 in 3 poor African Americans . <P> On the surface , this makes little sense . If the poor must struggle to buy groceries , how can they pack away enough to gain all that weight ? The assumption used to be that the poor were making bad food and lifestyle choices  --  Krispy Kremes instead of crispy greens . But now researchers have begun to suspect that the blame lies elsewhere . <P> The cost of food  --  quality food  --  is perhaps the best place to start . Calorically speaking , the best bang for the buck tends to be packed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candy bars ) . In general , processed foods hog ever larger portions of all Americans ' diets  --  one reason we spend just a tenth of our incomes on food today , compared with a fifth in 1950 . But a pound of lean steak costs a lot more than a pound of hot dogs . " The stomach is a dumb organ , " says J. Larry Brown , director of the Center on Hunger and Poverty in Waltham , Mass . " It does n't know anything about quality . It knows only when it 's full . " <P> Processed foods are n't just cheap , tasty and filling . They 're also more accessible . One study found that 28% of Americans live in what nutritionists call " food deserts , " places where big supermarkets are at least 10 miles , or a 20-min. drive , away . People who live in these places wind up buying much of their daily groceries from convenience stores or gas stations , where they can find Chef Boyardee but not baby carrots . Some communities are trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $100 million effort to open 10 supermarkets in urban neighborhoods . But for much of the country , says Troy Blanchard , a sociology professor at Mississippi State University who studies this issue , " you have people who are literally distanced out of healthy diets . " <P> Children of the poor face especially steep odds in fighting obesity . The cash-strapped schools many of them attend are more likely than others to cut physical-education classes and strike franchise deals with snack-food and beverage makers . After school , working parents would rather their kids stay inside watching TV than play outside in unsafe streets . Those hours in front of the tube , meanwhile , feed them a diet of ads heavy on sugary cereals and greasy burgers . No wonder obese adolescents are twice as likely to come from low-income families . <P> Though the ballooning obesity problem among the poor is finally getting the attention of academics and the government , nobody has yet come up with an easy fix . " Our remedies are very middle class , " says Adam Drewnowski , director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington . " They tell you , Seek a healthy diet and exercise . Well , if you 're working two jobs and living in a trailer , you 're in no mood to get home and make a salad . " In the end , fitness may have less to do with genetics than with tax brackets .  --  By Lisa Takeuchi Cullen
