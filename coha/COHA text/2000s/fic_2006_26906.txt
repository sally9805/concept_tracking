Chapter One Go , Bernie ! The sun was shining . Birds twittered in the apple trees . As I trotted across the sparkling , green lawn , I sang to myself , my new favorite song . . . . " I love Bernie Bridges , Bernie is the one who has fun . Go , Bernie ! Go , Bernie ! La-duh-da-duh-da whatever rhymes with Bridges . " Yes , I was making it up as I went along . I always write songs in my head . And they 're usually about one of my favorite people in the whole world -- me . Come on , dudes -- if you were popular and good-looking and smart -- who would you sing about ? And today I had a lot to sing about . For one thing , I love being at Rotten School . You poor thing . You probably have to go home every day after school . But Rotten School is a boarding school . I get to live at school in a dorm with all my friends -- and no parents ! Cool enough for you ? Another reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls ' dorm to find April-May June . April-May June is the hottest , coolest , dreamiest , drooliest , babe-alicious girl on campus . She 's my girlfriend . Only she does n't know it yet . She does n't have a clue that we were meant for each other . But she definitely ca n't resist me . Who can resist Bernie B. ? " Go , Bernie ! Go Bernie ! La-la-la something that rhymes with Bernie . . . " Do n't you wish you could write songs off the top of your head like that ? Another reason I was singing ? It was almost time for the party of the year . The All-Nighter . One of the great Rotten School traditions . Maybe you guessed from the name -- the party goes all night long ! We do n't go to sleep till the sun comes up . " Go , Bernie ! Go Bernie ! I knew April-May wanted to spend that special night with only one special person -- Bernie B. So I was trotting across the Great Lawn . I sang to myself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dorm . Suddenly I heard a deafening cry behind me : " Duck ! Bernie -- duck ! ! " Huh ? I stopped singing and hit the ground hard . Continues ...
