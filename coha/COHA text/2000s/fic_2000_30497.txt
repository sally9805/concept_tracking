1 what I did First I had to get his body into the boat . This was more than ten years ago , and I 've forgotten some of what came before and after , but that night and the following day I remember in extravagant detail . I had lain awake all night , trying to imagine how I might get him off the bed and down the stairs and into the rowboat , since he weighed at least a hundred and fifty pounds and might have gone stiff . My bed , I remember , felt absurdly uncomfort- able , as if someone had slipped walnuts and bolts into the layer just beneath the ticking , and there was something sharp and prickly , like hay , poking out of my pillow into my face and neck , yet I hardly moved all night . Every noise paralyzed me with fear . I had to force my eyes shut to think , literally hold them shut with my fingers , and in this way I worked through the problem -- get- ting him into the boat -- over and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning I was pretty sure I had it down . Once he was in the boat it would be easy . When it was light I sat up and put my feet on the floor . The room rocked and tilted slightly , like a room in a fun house or a ship . Lack of sleep made me dizzy , which caused a sense of unre- ality that I found comforting , as if now I was finally asleep , and only dreaming . But the feeling did not last , and after a minute or two I found some clothes on the floor and got dressed . I had worn these same clothes the day before , and perhaps the day before that , and as a consequence they were limp and smelled a little like onions . I washed my face in the bathroomsink , used the toilet , and went downstairs . In the kitchen I made myself a sandwich and put it in a plastic grocery bag , then got a small shovel from the back porch . It was the trowel I used in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cleaned it off as well as I could with my fingers , then gathered myself together and walked over to my mother 's house . Though it was still August it was getting cold in the mornings , and the grass was dewy , and a mist hung over the lake at the end of Fox Street . The air , when I breathed it , had a taste like cold lake water . Later , I knew , it would get hot and the wind would carry the smell of the ketchup factory from across the lake in Wallamee . That smell had always been a signal for me to dig out my leather shoes and wool skirts , that summer was ending and school was about to begin . Though I had been out of school for four years by that time , the smell still had the power to excite me , or more exactly , stimulate me . I had a tendency to be lazy in summers . It was a delicious feeling at first , but it cloyed . Fall aroused me to action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened . The boata battered metal rowboat with peeling green paint that had washed ashore on Train Line 's little beach one day , and that no one else had wanted to claimwas in the garage behind my mother 's house . The garage was rickety and packed with junk , but I kept my boat there because I had no storage space at my apartment . I took it out on the lake quite often , so I was pretty sure that anyone seeing me drag it down to the dock would not find it odd . I lugged the boat up to the back door , attached the hose to the outdoor faucet , and pretended to wash the hull . Water tributaried across the small dead lawn and puddled around the laundry pole . The sun , though it was barely up , burned the top of my head and made me feel spot-lit and uncomfortable , as if I was being watched . Just in case , I continued my charade : giving the hull another good rinse , winding the hose back up , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nylon rope out of the garage and went inside to get Peter . He was where I 'd left him , of course , in the upstairs bedroom that had once been mine . When I was a little girl , I 'd demanded red gingham wallpaper . It was still there . So were the shelf of paperbacks , the failed ant farm , the blue-flowered linoleum , and the rag rug made from my old dresses . It smelled of dust and dead wasps , the closed-in odor it always got in summer when I 'd left the window shut . And another smell , a hot , difficult one I did n't want to acknowledge : Peter 's smell . He smelled more powerfully like himself now that he was dead than he had when he was alive . It made me angrysuddenly and obscurelythat this had been done to my room , where I had once been so happy . Peter was in bed . One of his feet , still in its worn brown shoe , stuck out from the blankets . I recalled closing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered that I could n't look while I was doing it and that I had to turn away and find them by touch . But now one had opened up again . It stared milkily at the lightbulb on the ceiling . With my thumb I pushed the lid down again ; this time it would stay only halfway shut . His mouth hung open , too , but there was nothing I could do about that except not look at it . It occurred to me then that I had not lost my mind , but had instead put it somewhere so far away and hard to reach that I had little hope of ever retrieving it . Dragging him from the bed onto the tarpaulin , which I 'd spread on the floor , was like pulling a long root from damp soil . I could n't lift him , so I tugged him by his arm , then by his leg , and little by little extracted him from the bed . He hit the floor and the whole house shook . Again without looking at his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time I was sweating . and having trouble catching my breath . I sat down to rest at the top of the narrow staircase and looked down into the living room below . Hardly any light made it past the drapes , but I could see the glint of the clock pendulum and the long-legged shape of the oscillating fan . Good-bye , I said to it . So long . I was n't really going anywhere ; I 'd be coming back and this room would be exactly the same , but this ordinary fact was impossible to believe . I had to push Peter down the stairs . He slid , like a large fish , about halfway , then I pushed him again . * * * I dragged him to the boat , tipped it onto its side , and rolled Peter into it , then hauled the boat the block and a half to the lake . Anyone looking might have noticed I had something bulky and heavy in it , but I was right to think no one would be out . Summer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my feet braced somewhat awkwardly on either side of Peter . Mist still hung over the surface , and droplets clung to my eyelashes and hair . The lake had been carved by glaciers ; it was long and slender as a crooked finger . I rowed the length for half an hour , then navigated my way through a narrow inlet . There were cattails here , and the wreck of an old beaver dam , but my boat was steady in the water and nimble , and I slipped right by . I was going to a place I 'd visited a few times as a teenager , at the end of the lake and up the shore a bit . In fact , once I 'd brought Peter there for a picnic . It was a grassy clearing , hidden from boaters on the lake by a tree-covered spit of land . A little farther inland there was a dilapidated barn : the only sign of people anywhere around . At the edge of this clearing , about fifteen feet from shore , was where I planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat while I dug . I did n't care if the hole was very deep , just that it was long enough . Once when I was a child I tried burying a dead cat in a hole not big enough for it , and I still can not forget pushing down on it to make it fit , pressing its head with my trowel . Its ears filled horribly with dirt . * * * It took all day . Though it was a clearing there were lots of rocks and roots I had to dig out , but I 'd told myself all night that I would be patient , that I would n't do a rush job under any circumstances . At one point , a pair of fishermen floated around the spit . I lay in the weeds , looking at my dirty hands and praying they would n't find my boat , which was hidden in a stand of cattails . I could hear them talking . " Too shady back here , man . " " You think ? " " Like the underside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I know this other place , back where we were . " " Whatever you say , man . " They floated off again . The dirt , which was soft and wet , had a fetid odor . It was the smell the lake acquired in summer , sometimes , when the water fell and exposed the rank mud . It was an odor of such active decay that I felt reassuredthe earth would absorb Peter in no time . I could n't eat the lunch I 'd brought . By mid-afternoon the hole was about four feet deep and five and a half feet long : the length of Peter Morton . I pulled the boat to shoreI was quite tired by this time , and shakingtipped Peter onto the ground , then rowed out around the spit to make sure no one was coming . There was one boat on the lake , a speedboat , but it was far off and did n't appear to be headed in my direction , so I rowed the boat to shore again . I realized , after I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tarpaulin , that I should probably take his clothes off . People can be identified by their clothes ; I had read this somewhere , or maybe seen it on a television mystery . The thought hit me with a wave of sickness , of almost incapacitating regret . I took his wallet from his pocket , put it in my lunch bag , then unbuttoned his shirt . I had to tear it to get it off over his arms . His pants were easier . I unzipped the fly and pulled them down , an action so familiar I could close my eyes and pretend for a moment that we were somewhere else , in any of the dozens of places we had made love . I quickly tugged off his briefs and rolled him into the hole . Oh , Peter ! He lay facedown . He had pretty hair , black and wavy and shiny as an otter 's . I could n't bring myself to throw dirt on it . I could n't do it to his narrow back , either , with its delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knocked over by an urge , then , to pull his face out of the muck and blow into his mouth , to clear the mud from his eyes and his nose and save him . I turned and ran into the woods . I despaired that I would never get lost in them , that I would always be with myself , that the world was not big enough to swallow me whole . I wanted him to get up and be alive again ; I wanted to fly apart . My forehead slammed and tore against the rough bark of a hickory tree , and the pain calmed me . Wiping blood from my eyes , I filled the hole . When it was all done , I threw my shovel and his clothes , weighted with stones , into the lake and walked up the rise to the old barn . Inside I found a wooden trough full of rainwater . I washed my hands and face as well as I could , then I lay down on a fallen beam , looking upward . Through the gapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I watched clouds slide by . It was a ruined world .
