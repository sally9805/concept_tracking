Excellent teacher education programs provide students with experiences from which they can construct their own understandings of music , education , and music education <p> In 1986 , Lee Shulman suggested that there is more to teacher education than ( 1 ) understanding the subject matter and ( 2 ) understanding how people learn. 1 His writings influenced teacher education by recognizing that prospective teachers must also understand the ways these two fields interact , that is , ( 3 ) understanding how people learn the particular subject matter , what he called pedagogical content knowledge . To become a music teacher , an individual must understand ( 1 ) music , ( 2 ) learning and teaching , 2 and ( 3 ) music learning and teaching . <p> How does a preservice music education student formulate these understandings ? First , it is important to explain this perspective - that students must indeed formulate their own understandings . The mainstream ideas espoused as best practice in todays schools are rooted in a constructivist vision of learning and teaching , namely , that in order to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person can not make another learn . Knowledge is not passed on or transferred . Learning is something that individuals do , most often with the help and support of other people . This perspective on how people learn is rooted in the findings of experts in many different fields who have considered the nature of human learning , including biologists and neurophysiologists ; cognitive psychologists , neuropsychologists , and sociopsychologists ; linguists , psycholinguists , and sociolinguists ; and even anthropologists and philosophers . <p> If people learn by constructing their own understanding of their experiences , then teaching is essentially a process of designing experiences and providing support for learners as they actively and interactively engage in those experiences . The education of music teachers , then , is designing experiences that enable them to construct understandings of music , of learning and teaching , and of music learning and teaching. 4 If teaching music involves acting on all these understandings in concert , then learning to teach music must involve synthesizing understandings of music , of learning and teaching , and of music learning and teaching . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The curriculum must provide opportunities for students to wrestle with the most important ideas central to all three fields and to formulate understandings of how they intertwine and interact . This can not be accomplished through a set of disconnected methods courses . Students must understand theory and practice - how practice arises from theory and belief . Teacher education is not just modeling practice . Even young undergraduates need opportunities to work with the most sophisticated ideas of our field . As a profession , we tend to underestimate prospective teachers ' ability to understand pedagogy , just as we underestimate children 's capabilities in music . Well-designed learning experiences , coupled with appropriate scaffolding ( i.e. , support ) from peers and teacher , enable children to excel in music at levels we have not seen before and help young teachers to excel as music teachers with a sophistication we may not have thought possible . <p> A curriculum that lives in " silos " - where what students learn in music history , theory , and performance seems to have little or no bearing on what they learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students need to become music educators . Some writers have described intelligence as the ability to make increasingly acute discriminations in the context of increasingly wide connections. 5 The understandings it takes to be a music teacher He in the ability to make increasingly acute discriminations within increasingly wider connections in the areas of music , education , and music education . To enable students to accomplish this , faculty who interact with music education students need to work together ; they need to have conversations about what and how they teach . Each faculty member needs to understand and value everyone 's role in the process . How do you accomplish this in a system that has traditionally thrived in silos ? <p> When music education practice is taught in ways that make it seem distant from or unrelated to traditional music practice , non-music-education faculty do not see the music education curriculum as relevant to what they teach . However , if music education process and practice are rooted in authentic music and learning experiences , it becomes much easier for non-music-education faculty to connect to and value what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are central to the fields of music , education , and music education in terms of their potential for achieving authenticity . Authentic Conception of Music <p> Since the Woods Hole Conference of 1959 and Jerome Bruner 's subsequent 1960 publication of The Process of Education , 6 educators have considered the basic elements of a field of knowledge to be the core or essence of what students need to learn in that field . Music educators embraced this notion by focusing their teaching on what we then identified as the elements of music . While the idea of breaking down a field of knowledge into its core elements did give rise to some transformative visions of how music should be taught , it has also created some problematic visions of music teaching , as some critics of current music education practice have pointed out. 7 Further , while it is certainly possible to design instruction based on the elements of music for young , inexperienced musicians , the approach can be problematic for teachers working with more advanced students , as in a secondary school or university setting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the elements of music in their work ; it is that the elements are not their main focus . Instead , the elements become tools they use to analyze or make decisions about the expressive qualities of music . More sophisticated music learners certainly need to be aware of the elements of music and of how they interact to produce a musical whole , but focus on the individual elements per se is not the most salient aspect of their work . <p> Conceiving of these aspects of music as elements can lead to an atomistic vision of music in which the sum of the parts ( elements ) equals the whole . Most of us embrace a more holistic vision of art , understanding that the whole is far greater than the sum of its parts . A teacher who conceives of a musical work from an atomistic frame will plan a very different kind of instruction from a teacher who is striving to enable students to produce or understand a musical whole that is much more than the sum of its elements . The idea of dividing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general ) into its constituent elements derives from a scientific view of the world , one that dominated many fields ( education among them ) in the mid-twentieth century . <p> Perhaps it would be more fruitful for us to consider framing our understanding of a musical work in terms of dimensions of music as opposed to elements . I borrow the notion of dimensions from George Lakoff and Mark Johnson , cognitive linguists who suggest that highly complex human ideas are multidimensional gestalts , or multidimensional wholes. 8 From my perspective , this idea is more authentic for music than the scientific model of separate elements . I can more easily envision considering a musical work from the perspective of its various dimensions ( its rhythmic organization , its use of pitch or harmony , its form or texture ) than from its separate elements . The concept of dimension puts us in a better position to see rhythm or pitch or form as one aspect of a musical work that is intrinsically embedded in the whole work and not a separate entity . Envisioning rhythm as a dimension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , whereas conceiving of rhythm as a discrete element could give rise to such a practice . No doubt Bruner did not intend his notion of elements to be interpreted as individual concepts to be taught separate and apart from the whole , but since this has happened in music education practice , perhaps dimension is a more authentic metaphor than element for the ideas that comprise our field. 9 <p> Considering a musical work to be a multidimensional whole that can be studied from the perspectives of its various dimensions makes it possible for us to think in terms that are broader than the traditional musical elements . Perhaps we should consider using dimensions , multidimensions , and metadimensions of music as frames for instruction instead of elements. 10 Dimensions would include all the traditional musical elements , some of which are multidimensional ( e.g. , melody includes both pitch and rhythm ; harmony is created by pitch , texture , and rhythm ) . Metadimensions like style , genre , architecture , affective qualities , or cultural or historical context would be most useful for framing instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimensions of music holds greater capacity for moving us toward more authentic ways of thinking about music learning and teaching . <p> From this perspective , learning music is constructing understanding of the dimensions , multidimensions , and metadimensions of music and how they interact to create a musical whole . Music learning is also developing the ability to act on that understanding . Engaging in music involves three processes : performing , listening , and creating . Music learning is the ability to apply musical understanding to musical process . <p> From this perspective , teaching music means facilitating this process in others . The ability to do this effectively requires that an individual achieve a certain level of mastery himself or herself . Most existing music teacher education programs recognize this and require music education students to engage in all the experiences necessary for the formulation of musicianship alongside students seeking to become performers , composers , historians , theorists , and so forth . <p> The experiences that students engage in throughout their education as music teachers must enable and support the continual development of their ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dimensions , multidimensions , and metadimensions of music . As suggested by the originators of the Comprehensive Musicianship curricula implemented in some universities in the late 1960s and early 1970s , this is best accomplished when genuine connections are established among the various segments of university music programs ( e.g. , music theory and aural skills , music history , music performance , music education ) and , most important , when these connections are clearly evident to the students engaged in the curriculum. 12 When music educators frame their conversations about musical ideas in terms that link directly to what nonmusic-education faculty teach , it can facilitate these connections and begin to break down silos . Authentic Conception of Learning <p> As described earlier , current visions of best practice in education derive from a constructivist vision of knowing , learning , and teaching . The term constructivism encompasses diverse philosophical and psychological viewpoints . The essence of a constructivist perspective is a belief that knowledge is a human construct . Constructivists recognize that we can only know the world through the lens of our own experience - physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and celebration of multiple perspective , since each of us experiences life through a different frame - the frame of our prior experience and of our personal interpretation of that experience . This has implications for philosophy , psychology , and the practice derived from these understandings . Many different fields , including musicology and music theory , embrace these ideas . In fact , it is quite sensible for musicians because it speaks to personal interpretation , such as one might develop as a performer , creator , or listener . <p> Most constructivists believe that we each experience the world from our own perspective , which means that we each experience life a bit differently . Each of us develops our own perspective or worldview as a result of our life experiences . This is why cultural or gender issues , for example , can affect how we experience a particular situation . To some extent , there is a uniqueness to the ways that each of us experiences life , but there is also a thick web of commonality we all share . As individuals , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we know we have learned from others , in one way or another . <p> Recognition of the complexity of the human learning process ( and , therefore , the teaching process ) has led educators to seek ways of making classroom learning situations come as close as possible to the ways people learn outside classrooms , in society , in their families , in life . Rooted in sociocultural and constructivist perspectives , educators have come to understand that all knowledge is socially constructed . This does not mean that we are unable to learn on our own , but it does mean that even when we learn on our own , it is as a result of prior human interactions . Within the sociocultural context , learning occurs when there is shared understanding among the participants . Shared understanding enables one person to teach another or learn from another. 13 The role of the teacher is to design experiences in which students will be invited to engage . As students engage , the teacher supports their work through what Bruner called scaffolding - filling in the gap between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what he or she can do with teacher support. 14 Understanding the ways people learn and using that knowledge to frame teaching practice produces authentic teaching process . Authentic Conception of Music Learning <p> Best practice in music education should draw upon the most central and authentic conceptions of music and learning . This has not always been the case . There are practices in music education that we might call " folk practices " because they are rooted in a long line of tradition , but not necessarily in the essence of music or sound teaching practice . Some of this folk mentality lingers in contemporary classrooms in spite of what the field of education can teach us about the nature of learning and teaching . As a profession , we should be sure we know about the most cutting-edge ideas in both music and education to ensure that we are offering our students the most authentic learning experiences possible . <p> In a constructivist music classroom , students would have opportunities to construct their own understanding of the dimensions , multidimensions , and metadimensions of music through interaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrived to teach a particular concept ) by performing , creating , and listening . They would have opportunities to solve genuine musical problems ( performance problems , creation problems , listening problems that are genuine in that they are problems " real " musicians solve ) with the support ( scaffolding ) of peers and teacher . They would have multiple opportunities to share ideas ( musical ideas and ideas about music ) with peers and teacher and a right to have their ideas respected and valued by all . They would understand the goals of the experience and have sufficient grounding in the processes and understandings necessary to achieve the goals . They would be agents of their own learning , empowered to develop their own musicianship in genuine musical contexts . They would have opportunities to engage in authentic music in the context of authentic instructional design that honors and respects the ways they naturally learn . An Authentic Music Teacher Education Curriculum <p> An ideal music education curriculum would enable students to develop their understanding of the most central , authentic ideas of music , education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to formulate connections among these ideas throughout their study . <p> If students are to develop the understandings necessary to teach music effectively , they need opportunities to become the best musicians they can . Our profession has many resources that describe how this might best be achieved - in particular , standards set forth by the National Association of Schools of Music CNASM ) , the body that accredits most music education programs in the United States . <p> One of the most important standards NASM sets forth is synthesis . Accredited programs must be able to show how their curricula enable students to synthesize what they learn in the various aspects of the program into a level of musical understanding and proficiency appropriate for someone entering the field as a professional musician . In addition to the ability to synthesize musical ideas , prospective music teachers need to be adept at analysis , evaluation , and application of musical ideas - and initiation of original musical ideas . They need to know how to think in sound and act on that thinking . <p> Students must also have opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what they learn about music . Following is a suggested set of courses designed to foster these understandings . See the Sample Curriculum for Preservice Music Teacher Education sidebar for a more complete list of courses . <p> Introductory Course . Many schools offer freshmen an introductory music education course designed to plant seeds early in the process - seeds that are then gently watered throughout students ' experiences in the curriculum . Such introductory courses should enable students to begin to confront their own understandings of and beliefs about music and music learning and teaching . It is important for any introductory course to start where the students are , to link to their perspectives , to recognize and honor the knowledge they bring to the experience . Early conversations need to be about what students are thinking as they begin the process . Students ' experiences in introductory courses should raise many more questions than they answer . This experience should enable students to enter the rest of the curriculum intrigued and eager for answers. 15 <p> Course(s) on Learning and Teaching . Prospective music teachers need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply to music learning and teaching . They need to understand the various theories of learning that have been proposed throughout the history of education and how they play out in music education practice . In the best-case scenario , music faculty teach these courses , enabling prospective teachers to consider the implications of each theory for music learning and teaching . This allows preservice teachers to carefully and intelligently analyze existing music methods , with an eye toward uncovering which practices are rooted in the ways that people actually learn and which are rooted in " folk " theories . This course ( or set of courses ) should be placed early enough in the curriculum to enable students to become aware of their own music learning and the ways they are being taught . <p> Methods Courses . With a healthy understanding of music learning and teaching processes , students should begin to experience applications of best practice to all kinds of music teaching settings . Whether students are learning to teach elementary or secondary general music or to leach in a performance-ensemble setting , it is critical that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and teaching course(s) . It is also essential that authentic musical experience remains at the core of music education methods . <p> Music Theory and History Courses . Concurrent with their professional coursework , students should engage in experiences in theory and history courses that emanate from the study of whole , authentic musical works . Many approaches currently employed in these areas already promote this kind of teaching . Theory , aural skills , and history should be based on real music , involving holistic listening with understanding , studying the details or history in the context of the musical whole . Analysis should emerge from real music , perhaps music the students already know or are learning to perform . Students also need opportunities to generate original musical ideas ( compose , improvise ) in the context of building understanding of existing works . <p> Conversely , when students ' work in music education courses demands that they operate as musicians , they find themselves constantly referring to and drawing upon the knowledge base they are building through their theory and history courses . <p> Performance Courses . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a variety of styles , genres , and historical and cultural contexts . This is not a new idea in our profession - more recent efforts have advocated expanding opportunities for experiencing musics other than Western art music . <p> Many fine studio teachers understand that effective applied instruction must foster student thinking and decision making in order to nurture musical independence . Good studio teachers may be unaware that such practices are considered constructivist , but they are aware that such strategies nurture success . U is possible to discover on ones own that people learn by constructing understanding of experience . Good teachers have probably been working in constructivist ways for centuries , perhaps without the finer points , and perhaps without recognizing their practice as such . <p> This has not , however , been the case with our traditions in large ensemble settings . Here is the place where empowering the individual seems contrary to the goal , but is it ? Successful ensemble work requires individuals to function in concert with others with a sophisticated level of sensitivity to and awareness of others that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a setting must know how to empower individuals to see the big picture and understand their role within it . Good ensemble teaching also requires honoring what individuals bring to the experience . Further , learning is enhanced when the conductor/teacher shares his or her thought processes with the group throughout the rehearsal or , better still , seeks input from ensemble members . This helps performers understand the goals and how to achieve them and also helps prospective music teachers understand how to make such decisions . <p> Philosophy Course . Many music education programs offer a capstone philosophy course . Such a course offers the opportunity for students to reflect on all they have learned about music , education , and music education and articulate it in terms of what they 've learned about music-teaching practice . This is the opportunity for students to reap what has grown from the seeds planted in the introductory course . Thus , the introductory course and the philosophy course serve as bookends to the music teacher education curriculum . <p> No teaching act is devoid of philosophical or psychological context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actor believes about the nature of learning and , in this case , of music . Experiences in a curriculum such as the one described here can ensure that prospective teachers are acting with intention and not just out of habit - habit born of their own experiences as learners and not necessarily what they were taught to do as teachers . Making Authentic Connections <p> Students engaged in a curriculum like the one described here become agents of their own learning , empowered to develop their own musicianship and their own understanding of music education practice . When authentic music experience is at the core of the entire curriculum , students ' own musicianship can be transformed through their music education courses as well as through the rest of their experiences. 16 <p> Because musicianship is at the core of this way of conceiving music education curriculum , it becomes easy for students to make connections to the rest of their music learning . Teaching music education courses in ways that are strongly connected to authentic musical practice and authentic learning process fosters students ' ability to connect their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to apply musical understanding to musical process . " <p> " Each teaching act is deeply rooted in what the actor believes about the nature of learning and of music .
