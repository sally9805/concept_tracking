LAST SUMMER THE OUTGOING SURGEON GENERAL DAVID SATCHER ISSUED HIS REPORT ON THE STATE OF THIS COUNTRY 'S SEXUAL HEALTH . PT PUTS A FACE ON THE HARD FACTS . PUBLIC POLICY ON SEXUAL HEALTH HAS A TROUBLED history . Competing agendas , dismissed administrators and shrill representatives often obscure the facts rather than inform the public . Surgeon General David Sotcher , M.D. , Ph.D. , sought to change this contentious tone by bringing together health professionals representing diverse disciplines and points of view . These meetings produced the surgeon general 's report on sex in America , Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health and Responsible Sexual Behavior . Without scientific debate , says Satcher , discussion would continue to be fueled by special interests , salacious media and schoolyard mythology . Call to Action emphasizes that our first task is to encourage honest discussion about sexuality . We then need to find realistic responses to increased rates of sexually transmitted diseases ( STD ) and HIV , sexual violence , unintended pregnancies and abortions . Satcher recognizes that different communities may have different values and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Action is a starting point , not an end point , from which to develop solutions . Psychology Today takes a closer look at the statistics and talks to some of the people they represent . Unintended pregnancies Nearly half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unintended . While women of all ages , incomes and ethnic backgrounds have unintended pregnancies , numbers are highest among adolescents , lowincome women and women of African-American descent . Unintended pregnancies are also medically costly . They con , for example , increase risk for low birth weight and infant mortality . Aside from higher medical expenses , the cost to society is palpable . Intended pregnancies affect education rates , welfare dependency and even subsequent child abuse and neglect . MANDY OLIVARES It has n't been an easy life for Mindy and John Olivares . When the young couple found out she was pregant last year , they were worried . They had n't intended to have children so soon . Mandy , however , does n't believe in abortion . So at age 20 , she is the mother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 when she had her first child . Receiving an eviction notice-their apartment building was converted into a cooperativeadded to the couple 's stress . To cover their expenses , Mandy returned to work as a sales clerk . John who already holds down a day joba as a clerical worker , plans to take on a night job to help make ends meet . Still , the couple has never relied on welfare . ' " I got myself into this situation , " says Mandy . " I 'd rather do it on my own and work with my husband than depend oin others . " She even has ambitions to return to college and major in interior design and business . " I had two jobs before I got pregnant with my second child , I can do that again . " She says she 's not worried : " I have faith . " STDs LAURA ZIMMER Barely 18 years old and a freshman in college , Laura Zimmer was just beginning to explore her sexuality when she contracted genital herpes . " I was a naive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confronted her boyfriend , he denied knowing he carried the disease . But rather than face possible rejection by other , noninfected men , she stayed with and eventually married him . Ten years later , Zimmer realized that she and her husband were n't compatible and they divorced . Soon she found herself facing the same chatlenge she had avoided as a teenager . " I 'd date someone until I had to reveal that I had herpes , " she says . " Then I 'd sabotage it-let my very worst traits come out-so if he rejected me it was n't because I had shared something personal . " But Zimmer could n't continue living with her fear of rejection . She wanted people to know her story ; so she wrote it and then e-mailed it to nearly everyone she knew . " It 's the best thing I ever did , " says Zimmer , who 's now in a healthy , honest relationship . " Everyone responded with such love and respect . This is part of me that wo n't change , and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million people in the U.S. are infected with genital herpes , and I million new cases occur every year . Sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) rates in the U.S. are the highest in the developed world . Chlamydia and gonorrhea are approaching epidemic proportions among some adolescent populations , and one in five sexually active adults may be infected with genital herpes . Education is critical , as is breaking the chains of transmission through abstinence , condom use or screening and treatment . Silence is unacceptable . Hosexuality Some 80 percent of gay men and women have experienced verbal or physical harassment , Photograph Photograph // 45 percent have been threatened with violence and 17 percent have been physically attacked . Strengthening families  --  whatever their structure  --  and encouraging stable , enduring adult relationships is important to sexual health . The stigma of this sexual orientation can lead to harassment , depression and suicide . BILL AND DWAYNE When Bill told his mother he was gay , she was less than understanding . " She made comments that I would go to hell , " he recalls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dwayne to celebrate Christmas with the family . Consequently , Bill did n't see her either . Her reaction has made it hard for Bill to disclose his life to others : " I 'm very guarded . I do n't feel like explaining myself . " At his former place of employment , one coworker compared gay people with child molesters . Although Bill , a 31-year-old cardiac sonographer , wanted to tell his co-worker to relax , he did n't : " I prefer not to have the confrontation . " Bill lives with Dwayne , a 33-year-old hotel worker , and their three dogs and two cats in Long Island , New York . They bought an abandoned house in a culturally diverse community and renovated it to the delight of their neighbors . But they realize that living in New York is much different than living in the South . " People here have more experience with gays who are out , " says Bill . While the couple feels comfortable in their neighborhood , Bill and Dwayne still keep a low profile . " We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , " says Dwayne . AIDS The AIDS epidemic is shifting toward women . While Photograph // women accounted for 28 percent of HIV cases reported between 1981 and 1999 , they accounted for 32 percent of reported cases between June 1999 and July 2000 . We need to observe that the enemy is the virus-not those infected . We need to team up with those infected to stem the spread of HIV . With their help , we can increase awareness of the need for responsible sexual behavior . MICHELLE LOPEZ turned tricks on the streets of New York in the mid1,980s , soon after she arrived fram her native Trinidad . But when she became infected with HIV in 1988 , if was through sexual intercourse with her husband . Their daughter , Raven , was born HIV-positive two years later and was diagnosed in 1992 . Everything changed . Lopez kicked drugs and compulsively researched the disease : " I saw what the gay white male population did . I saw what worked for the ones who wanted to live : learning about research and drug side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had fullblown AIDS since 1996 . She takes a cocktail of five drugs a day as well as Zoloft for depression . Today , Lopez is an AIDS educator at the health clinic where she first sought treatment nine years ago . Some 75 percent of the patients are women and , like Lopez , many emigrated from the Caribbean . Raven is now 12 and speaks publicly about being HIV-positive . Lopez feels that she herself has come full circle : " I want to help people live . A lot of people did that to me . When Raven and I were diagonsed , I was on a mission to live . Now , I 'm on a mission to save my child 's life . " Abortion HARA ESTROFF MARANO " I have had two abortions , " says Hara Estroff Marano. the time of her first , in the early 1960s , abortion was illegal . Marano ended up on a dining-room table with a coat hanger and a little Italian woman standing over her . The then 21-year-old college student " was oddly confident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so a friend whisked her to a Boston hospital for an emergency D and C. She woke up at three in the morning inside an oxygen tank , scared and without the emotional support of her family . " I felt I had screwed up and I was n't going to get any sympathy from my family . " Photograph // Years later , in her midthirties , Marano faced an impending divorce and another unwanted pregnancy- Already the mother of two young children , she chose to have an abortion . This time , the procedure was professional and not in the least traumatic . " Being a mother is the most important job we have . To be a parent we need resources-emotional , financial and social , " says Marano , PTs editor at large and editor of the magazine 's Blues Buster newsletter . An estimated 1.37 million women underwent abortions in the U.S. in 1996 . Of that figure , nearly 45 percent had already received at least one abortion . Teenage pregnancy has become a focus , but abortion rates are , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is general agreement that rates should be lower . One way to achieve this is by providing information on , access to and use of contraception . The Opposition Surgeon General David Satcher is n't exactly a popular public figure in many circles . The Family Research Council , for one , has demanded his resignation . So it is no surprise that Satcher 's Call has met with a chorus of controversy . The Bush administration and numerous other groups , including the American Family Association , Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council have denounced the report . These various organizations disagree with several points in the report . For example , the surgeon general advises schools to teach abstinence , while also recommending that students be educated about birth control . This approach , known as " abstinence plus , " has drawn the most fire . " The safe-sex campaign has been a disaster , " says Ed Vitagliano , of the American Family . Association . The report also concludes that there is no valid scientific evidence that sexual orientation can be changed  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the line with that promoted by homosexuality advocacy groups , " says Vitagliano , who objects to the view that " sexual orientation is determined at an early age and that there is no valid evidence that orientation can be changed .
