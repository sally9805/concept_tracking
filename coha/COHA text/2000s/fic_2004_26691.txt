Early Leaving A Novel Chapter One Some memories we ignore . Others , little half-stories , we tell again and again , trotting them out for friends  --  and even people we barely know  --  like scrubbed children . We love what they say about us , the rosy image they project , exactly what we hoped and imagined our lives would be : bringing the baby home from the hospital , making up silly jingles about the shops and people we passed , turning everything into song . The baby 's first lopsided smiles , definitely not gas , real smiles . Steadying him , that day in the park , as he took his first steps , the rolling Charlie Chaplin gait , the sun playing around us in the grass like a goldfish . The time we were at the lake and skipped rocks across a clean , calm surface . Later , when he dove in , water quickly erasing the path he 'd taken .

Our lawyer , Donald Sanders , worked out a plea to second-degree murder with the district attorney , and Early agreed to take it . Which means that tomorrow morning , our son will plead guilty . Donald says we have to prepare ourselves for the possibility that Early could get the maximum sentence . Life , with eligibility of parole . It 's also possible , Donald says , that Early could get a lesser sentence , fifty years , forty , maybe as low as fifteen years . The sentence is up to the discretion of the court . Prepare ourselves for a life sentence ? Life is what is given to a child by his mother . Not a judge . If he gets forty or fifty years , I probably wo n't be around when he 's released . Fifteen years ? He 'll be thirty-three when he 's set free . That 's almost as many years in prison as he 's spent with us . Just for tonight , I 'm going to stop being terrified .

If the truth makes my reflection stare back at me , I 'll tell myself , Get an eyeful . I realize that if I go deep , I might find that I should have seen the end coming . Which raises the question , Was there a point where I could 've come between my son and the things that lay in wait for him ? Should I have paid closer attention ? Stepped in , instead of holding back ? Or is it all just a matter of choices and chance , the way every one of us drifts close to danger but only some get sucked in ? The question I do n't want to ask myself : Was I the cause ? At five , Early 's favorite bedtime story was the one I made up about the night he was born . I 'd lie slant across the foot of his bed and say that on May 7 , 1969 , mothers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a baby . I 'd lightly squeeze his toes through the blanket , clear my throat to build suspense , and keep going . We heard there were dozens of newborns available for pickup in the nursery , I 'd say . But instead of each set of parents choosing a baby in a levelheaded , orderly fashion , there was a huge ruckus . Mothers started shoving mothers , fathers punching fathers  --  everybody was red-faced and yelling  --  because we all wanted the same baby . And you know who that baby was ( my exact words , Early 's favorite part ) . When the battles were finally over , I 'd tell him , we 'd beaten out the Dunhams , who begrudgingly settled for the baby one bassinet over , a howler named Chip . The Jacksons had reluctantly taken Eddie and gone home . The Todds sulked off carrying Steven , but not yet resigned to the idea of Steven .

Over and over , Early would ask me to tell the story . The second or third time , I 'd escalate the drama a notch  --  wrestling one of the mothers to the floor , her shoes flying off like in a cartoon , arms and legs in the air like a bug , her cries : " Okay , okay , take Early ! He 's yours ! " My sweet son would sit straight up in bed and wiggle with excitement . The idea of his birth causing such commotion ! Imagine how much that little baby was wanted ! His sheet and blanket would rustle , his head bob . That full head of fair hair he got from me . Then I 'd tuck him in , making sure the covers were snug under his arms and along both of his sides .

Peter 's a formal person , self-contained and private . A patent attorney with the oldest , most respected law firm in Charlotte . Board of trustees at the Y. Head of a million committees .
