Sheila lies on top of me , snoring , her heavy breasts heavy on my chest , her stomach on my stomach , her hair damp in the afternoon heat , a shard of light through the white shutters she closes when we make love , the slow beat of the overhead fan , the tiny sound of a radio from the street . I too am falling asleep . I fly above mountains , dizzy , frightened . Someone 's arm slides across my face . What ? What ? An hour has passed , maybe two . I sit up on the silk rug , sweaty . In slow motion , Sheila kisses the back of my neck , stands , and stretches . " I like it here , with the books , " she says and yawns . " I always have . Have you read them all ? I 'll bet most of them are for show . " Grinning at me , she takes a long sip from the wineglass on the bookshelf . I watch the amber liquid swirl slowly around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white . She is not unattractive in her middle-aged nakedness , and I think that I may even love her , but I am ready for her to leave . There is a certain book I want to finish . Still completely naked , she saunters into the kitchen and comes back to the study with the portable TV , turns it on . Click . We are watching a commercial about deodorant , then a news broadcast of some hurricane in Honduras . Hundreds of men and women huddle beside crude shelters , children play in the mud . Trucks unload food and medical supplies . " I 'm going to send them a donation , " says Sheila . " Them ? " " CARE . Oxfam . You should too . " What can I say to Sheila ? I am still half asleep , limp from our lovemaking , unprepared even to look out the window . As I rub the sleep from my eyes , I am tempted to turn off the TV . The truth is , I feel no connection to the faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pixels . I 've decided that has been the great achievement of our age : to so thoroughly flood the planet with megabits that every image and fact has become a digitized disembodied nothingness . With magnificent determination , our species has advanced from Stone Age to Industrial Revolution to Digital Emptiness . We 've become weightless , in the bad sense of the word . The Honduran women in their earth-colored shawls , the vacant-eyed men wearing their lopsided straw hats , are nothing more than bits on the screen , surges of electrical current , evaporations . I wish Sheila had never turned on the TV . I 'd like to drift back to sleep , or read . Sheila has been somewhere upstairs , rambling around in one of the rooms , and casually descends the long spiral staircase . She 's put on a blouse but cleverly left it unbuttoned . " I 'm going to send a donation . " She raises one eyebrow at me , almost imperceptibly , waiting for me to say something or do something . I recognize this minute gesture as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was not paying attention . Unexpectedly , I find myself missing that little prod . " You can afford more than I can , Charles , " she says . " Right . " She is definitely trying to pick a fight . Could she be bored ? " Oxfam has an 800 number where you can use your credit card , " she says . " Or you can write a check . To the Honduran Hurricane Relief Fund . I 'm going to write a check . " " Go ahead , " I say . Sheila looks surprisingly sexy with the unbuttoned blouse . Her body is real , her body is not a digitized bit , it has weight and it 's twelve inches away . I reach for her breasts . She takes a step back . " Do n't act like a shit , " she says . I do n't feel like a shit . I 've thought about these things . Just the other day I was reading some article about the relativity of values . I mention this because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on TV . Even if they are not mere electronic data points , those people are not nearly as bad off as they seem . Because well-being and need are purely relative concepts . There is no such thing as poverty in itself , suffering in itself , unhappiness in itself . All is relative . Galileo , the physicist , was the first person to understand this idea . Absolute motion is unobservable . Only the relative motion between two objects has any meaning . The great painters also grasped the point : the eye responds only to relative lights and darks . Look at the pictures of Corot , for example Landscape with Lake and Boatman or Chteau Thierry . Look at the works of John Singer Sargent and Frederick Edwin Church . A dark region of canvas is dark only by virtue of being juxtaposed against a lighter region . Or consider colors . For years painters and photographers have known that the value of a color is perceived only in its relation to other colors around it . With the proper background , a green can appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote the magazine article , and I can not remember his or her name , it is only common sense to extend the argument to human contentment . Human beings consider themselves satisfied only compared to some other condition . A man who has owned nothing but a bicycle all of his life feels suddenly wealthy the moment he buys an automobile . For a few days he will drive his new car slowly through the neighborhood for people to gawk at , he will race his machine on the highway , he will lovingly polish the hubcaps until he can see his face in reflection . But this happy sensation soon wears off . After a while the car becomes just another thing that he owns . Moreover , when his neighbor next door buys two cars , in an instant our man feels wretchedly poor and deprived . Now I think again of the Honduran hurricane victims , and at this point I admit that I am extrapolating the argument on my own , beyond what he or she wrote in the article . Who is to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative to what ? The fact is , they are probably not accustomed to having much . Are n't the Honduran children laughing as they play in the mud ? To me , they look pleased as punch . Very likely they have what they need . Leave them alone . I ca n't decide what other people need , only what I need myself . But I 'm losing the thread of my argument . " Charles , I can see you thinking again , " says Sheila as she applies dark red lipstick , using her little finger . " You 're always thinking . It 's not good for you . " I write a check for fifteen dollars to the Honduran Hurricane Relief Fund and turn off the TV . Done . Now we 're eating ice cream , peppermint . Peppermint is my favorite , but I also stock plenty of pistachio and chocolate almond . Between bites Sheila draws on a cigarette and exhales in long silver strands . She wants to talk about a movie she saw last week , some romantic French thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies frequently myself , I have n't seen Sheila 's film and can only nod while she talks . She leaves to get a second bowl of ice cream from the kitchen , I hear the fridge open and close , a spoon clinks on the counter . The movie will be playing for another few weeks , she says . Would I like to go with her Friday night ? She would n't mind seeing it again . For some reason I now recover the thread of the argument I was making before . The real point is this : I have come to understand my own modest needs and aspirations . More importantly , I have descended to the level I deserve . In the morning , before getting dressed , I stand on my porch in my pajamas for a few minutes and smell the new day before it slips through my fingers . I eat my two poached eggs ( which I cook myself ) and my dry piece of toast . I drink my cup of coffee made in my dripomatic machine , two spoonfuls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my leafy little college , where I teach my morning classes . I make a few phone calls , meet a few students . In midafternoon I cycle home , past the well-tended gardens , the mailboxes on cedar posts , the two-story houses with their garages . Then I am home , in my own two-story house . Actually , not my house . A small-college professor , living as I do on a small-college professor 's pittance , could n't afford this house by a mile . My ex-wife bought the house , then left it to me upon her departure . One of my less pleasant colleagues once sniffed at me : " Not all of us are lucky enough to have wives who leave us such splendid houses when they divorce us . " And I answered , " It does n't bother me one bit , partner . Perhaps you 'll have better luck yourself the next time around . " Barbara knew exactly what she was doing . When we split up , she took only a little porcelain bottle that we 'd gotten together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , all of the furniture , even her clothes . She should have taken her goddamned stuff . She should have taken the house . She got her revenge . So I cycle through the neighborhood of successful lawyers and doctors and bankers , arrive home , and grade juvenile papers . In the late afternoon , I fix myself a drink , take out a book , sit in my chair . After dinner I work on one of my five-thousand-piece jigsaw puzzles of the countryside of France . Some evenings I do n't feel like working on a puzzle . Would n't my life be ridiculously extravagant to a Honduran , flood victim or not ? Of course . The main thing is : I do n't want to be disturbed . I have made sacrifices for this effete life of mine , at least relatively speaking , and I am comfortable . Do I lead the life of a selfish shit ? So be it . I am content in my shithood . " Are you going to your college reunion thing ? " asks Sheila . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When is it ? Is n't it in two weekends , on the sixth ? " " Yes . Will you go with me ? " I realize now that for at least the last month I have been hoping Sheila will go with me . I went to my twentieth reunion alone , just after my divorce , and it was murderous . Everyone was paired up with wives and girlfriends . Guys from all over the country who have n't seen each other for twenty years , have n't stayed in touch , do n't have any particular fondness for one another , crammed together for a weekend and acting like family . Then I skipped the twenty-fifth , the big one , the one where everyone talks about their place in the world . Out of the blue , I have decided to go to the thirtieth , all of us now in our fifties , balding , becoming farsighted , jowls beginning to sag , the precise knifeblade in time when we have accomplished much of what we are going to accomplish in life and are just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the other end . Why have I decided to go ? I do n't know . I do n't know . But I am comfortable , I will say to my classmates , extremely comfortable . I do n't want to be disturbed . " I ca n't go with you , " Sheila says . " Why do n't you ask Emily ? " " Emily does n't like to go on trips with me . She says that she feels like a child when we go on trips together . I probably wo n't see Emily until she comes home next Thanksgiving . Maybe not even then . Maybe she 'll spend Thanksgiving with Barbara . " " I wish I could go with you . But I 've got a client meeting that weekend . " " Please go with me . " She hesitates . " Maybe I can reschedule the appointment . " She looks at me sympathetically from across the room . But she has hesitated a few seconds too long , and I can tell that she does n't want to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reschedule your appointment . It 's all right . " Why ca n't people be honest with each other ? I am not being honest either .
