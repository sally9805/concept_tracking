Section : In review BOOKS TABLE <p> FOR MANY of us , Halloween is simply a matter of carving a pumpkin , arranging costumes for our kids and then accompanying them around the neighborhood for a couple of hours as they bulk up their supplies of treats . We may admire the simple pragmatism of their hunting-and-gathering strategies  --  " Which streets and houses give the most candy ? " " Can we knock on the doors of those places more than once without being noticed ? "  --  as they compare notes with other candy hunters . If we 're especially attentive we may see a carload or two of kids from other parts of town , whose parents do n't want them to miss out on the best pickings . <p> Nicholas Rogers 's new study of the old festival shows the connection between such contemporary versions of the holiday and its antecedents . The Christian celebrations which are said to be precursors to our modern observance  --  All Hallows ' Eve , All Saints Day , Harvest Festival  --  are of comparatively little interest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rogers maintains that there is a unifying motif in related seasonal festivals as far back as the Celtic Samhain , an autumnal celebration originating in Ireland , which reflected rites for the protection of the harvest , apprehension at the onset of winter and a more general awareness of the season 's shift toward increased darkness , That recurring motif is the celebration of transgressiveness . ( While this is not a new term , a primary contemporary meaning is that of " exceeding a limit or boundary , especially of social acceptability . " The related notion of liminality or liminal states  --  i.e. , " consciousness or conduct related by proximity to the threshold of a physiological or psychological response "  --  is also significant here . ) <p> Rogers energetically traces this entertaining thesis through various times , cultures and places . His extensive use of historic newspaper archives provides him with a vast array of anecdotes on how Halloween was celebrated in different places and periods . He describes early Druidic practices in autumn festivals ; the rise of masques and mummery ; disparate views on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " souling " ( the baking of " soul cakes " and their distribution to relatives or neighbors who offered to pray for the souls of the deceased in purgatory ) . <p> As with so many other preexistent pagan festivals , Christian societies seem to have adopted some of these practices and gradually given them specifically religious shapes and meanings . Thus , by about the 12th century , the backdrop of general " spookiness " created by the " Samhain " festival had become imbued with the veneration of the dead and with asserting the enduring claims of the departed upon those still living . It expressed this through masses , processions and the lusty tolling of bells to ward off demonic spirits . Manifestations of this general theme varied considerably from place to place : the opening and decoration of tombs in Naples , the reconsecration of graves in Brittany , the purchasing of extra candles and torches to stave off the encircling darkness in Bristol , and so on . <p> Rogers maintains that it was all but impossible for the English Reformation to suppress such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local parishes neither involved nor required clerical guidance . Folk-observances such as the lighting of bonfires on Hallowmass and the house-to-house selling of soul cakes , along with enthusiasm for spells , omens and fortune-telling , and a more general acknowledgment that this was a season of supernatural intensity all indicate that this festival ( by whatever name it was observed ) always seems to have corresponded with certain societal needs . <p> These and other old-country customs morphed and melded among immigrant populations in North America , gradually overwhelming the disdain for such celebrations among the Puritans and other early arrivals . Concerted efforts were made by immigrant leaders and societies to hold onto and even to rejuvenate old customs as a means of maintaining ethnic distinctiveness . Folk revelry in the form of pranks , music , costumes and so on proved far more adaptable to the New World than folk-religious traditions did . <p> By the early 20th century , the standardization and commercialization of Halloween were well under way , with most of what was needed for celebrating the event provided by shops rather than by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnessed an apparent increase in disturbing manifestations of Halloween , including tampering with snacks , increasing levels of vandalism , and the discovery of the holiday 's entertainment potential by Hollywood . ( The rise of the horror-movie genre receives a full chapter . ) <p> Rogers sees the 1970s as a renaissance period for Halloween , chiefly as , an outlet for the expression of " cultural inversion . " In the final two chapters , he takes stock of Halloween at the end of the millennium , noting how some elements both of European and Latin American ( El Da de los Muertos ) antecedents have been assimilated and reshaped by U.S. popular culture . <p> An impulse to " kick over the traces , " at least occasionally , has marked every society and has manifested itself in everything from forbid den rites to seasonal experimentation with folk religion to transvestite parades . One of Rogers 's central points is that the fear and spookiness surrounding Halloween have always tended to engender both reverence and revelry , and that the two responses are not easily separated . Writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in this-season of misrule , choristers became boy bishops and urban leaders were temporarily usurped from power by mock-mayors and sheriffs in a ritualized topsy-turvy world replete with ' subtle disguises , masks , and mummeries . " ' <p> If applied to our own time and extended to what we think our society might be like in a generation or so , what does this element of transgressiveness presage for Halloween 's future meaning or appeal ? The question assumes the presence of a fairly clear and resilient set of cultural , values against which halloween practices can be seen as reactions . But our culture 's familiarity with a common church year , common customs and common rituals is not what it once was . If our cultural consensus has been eroded by a rising tide of consumerism and diminished by the blurring of cultural identities , the holiday 's transgressive possibilities may soon be depleted . <p> Halloween " now grosses $6.8 billion , having more than doubled its revenue from candy , costumes , cards and party supplies in the last five years , " Rogers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 what seemed to matter most about Halloween was whether it would fulfill its commercial potential in the threat of an economic recession . Rogers 's overview of recent reactions to and adaptations of the festival does n't leave much hope that Halloween will retain any coherent meaning . For both parents and children Halloween , like the consumption of too much candy , is likely to become less and less satisfying . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> Reviewed by David Stewart <p> <p> David Stewart who is associate librarian in research services at Princeton Theological Seminary . <p>
