The time is now , the place , the City of Brotherly Love . And the crime is murder . <p> Murders , actually . Murders old , murders new . <p> Retired Philadelphia homicide detective Teddy Sunshine had been working four cold cases whenever business was slow at the Sunshine Detective Agency . He 'd been conducting a routine semiannual updating of his files on those cases when he was found dead in his home office , an apparent suicide . <p> But Teddy had n't eaten his old service revolver , the police said , until after he had strangled the woman he 'd been stalking for three weeks  --  Melodie Brainard , the wife of the leading mayoral candidate . <p> His three daughters are n't buying that story . They ca n't . They loved Teddy Sunshine . <p> One by one , Jolie , Jessica and the oldest , Jade , who had been partnered with Teddy in the Sunshine Detective Agency , took on the cold cases and worked them the way their father had worked them , sure one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one , the old cases were solved , leaving only two : the surely un-solvable tragedy of a high-school scholar athlete gunned down in a drive-by shooting , and the sad haunting case dubbed the Baby in the Dumpster . <p> But every answer the Sunshine sisters found seemed to raise new questions , and while the girls have felt cheered by their progress with the cold cases , they still ca n't prove Teddy 's innocence . <p> Jade , even more than her sisters , feels a responsibility to clear Teddy 's name . But will her obsession with the old cases , old hurts , past mistakes , risk her future with the man she had always loved , the man she 'd thought gone from her life after their short , troubled time together as Mr. and Mrs. Court Becket ? <p> The clock is ticking . <p> SUNDAY , 11:06 P.M. <p> There was a summer thunderstorm making it a noisy night outside the suburban Philadelphia mansion belonging to antiques importer Samuel Becket . Sam was n't there , however , having traveled to California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jolie Sunshine . <p> He 'd invited the three Sunshine sisters  --  Jolie , Jessica and Jade  --  to stay at the mansion as long as they liked , since their family home had been damaged by a suspicious fire shortly after the death of their father . Sam 's sprawling , securely fenced-in estate , complete with a gatehouse manned by intrepid former professional wrestler Carroll " Bear Man " Yablonski , was now Operations Central for the Sunshine Detective Agency , or what was left of it . <p> And what was left , now that Jolie had been forced to return to California , were TV cable-news journalist Jessica and Philadelphia homicide detective Matt Denby , Jade , and Sam 's cousin from Virginia , Courtland Becket . Court , owner of an almost embarrassing empire of five-star hotels , among his other assets , had flown immediately to Philadelphia when he 'd heard about the alleged suicide of Teddy Sunshine . He was n't going anywhere as long as Jade needed him . Even if she said she did n't . <p> Jade closed her cell phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he entered the living room . " I do n't believe it . " <p> Court , casually elegant in belted , pleated tan slacks and a form-fitting navy pullover too expensive to sport a label , tipped his head to one side inquiringly , and then headed for the bar in the far corner of the large room . " For the sake of harmony , neither do I. Ginger ale for you , right ? Considering the tone of your voice , however , I think I 'll have a beer . Oh , and what do n't I believe ? " <p> " Jessica , of course , " Jade said , thinking about her baby sister , who had left the house not four hours ago on what she had called a mission . " Poor Matt . " <p> " Poor Matt ? That does n't sound good . " Court returned to the conversation area with their drinks and sat himself down on the facing couch . " When we discussed this earlier , I thought the idea was that your sister was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on about ? If you love someone , let him go , et cetera , et cetera ? In which case , might I point out , you obviously adore me . " <p> " Not now , Court , please , " Jade said , getting to her feet and smoothing down the wrinkled skirt of her simple shirtwaist cotton dress . She was bone-weary and definitely rumpled . Only Court could still look fresh , and heart-crushingly handsome , this late in the day . Or maybe it was a gift bestowed only upon those who were born to generations of money . <p> Not that she wanted to think about that right now , either . She needed to pace , to work off some of the tense energy that had driven her these past weeks . Not even two weeks , in fact , since she 'd come home to find Teddy 's body in his office , the back of his head blown off and his service revolver on the floor beside his desk . And yet sometimes it felt like an eternity . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , how I do n't know . " <p> " You 're talking Jessica when you say you do n't know , right ? As to that , Sam and I have a theory that might apply here , " Court said , speaking of his absent cousin . " We 've decided that your baby sister is a witch . The good , G-rated , pretty , blond , nose-twitching kind . But still a witch . " <p> Jade smiled in spite of herself . " You and Sam might have a point . In any case , they 've gone off somewhere together . To celebrate before the rest of the world knows anything , which they will , soon , from coast to coast and in several large foreign cable markets  --  and that 's as close to a direct quote as I think I can get . She wo n't say where they 've gone , but she did say to hold the fort and that they 'll be back tomorrow night sometime . " <p> Court took a long pull on his beer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Let 's do roll call , Jade , all right ? Sam and Jolie ? In California , getting ready to fly to Ireland to shoot your sister 's next movie . Matt and Jessica ? Whereabouts unknown , although the words hotel suite with a king-size bed and room service seem to be one fairly plausible conclusion . They should have called me and I could have arranged for the penthouse downtown . " <p> Jade winced inwardly . She remembered that penthouse very well . She tried to cover her sudden discomfort by saying brightly , " Ah , but then we 'd know where they are , and I do n't think Jessica wants anyone to know . " <p> " Good point . In any case they 're gone , they 're not here . Jessica took our new friend Ernesto home earlier , where he is even now packing to leave for college on Tuesday . Mrs. Archer has the weekend off , although she may have come back by now . Still , her apartment is pretty isolated . Bear Man is in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing in front of a mirror as he strikes a few muscle-popping poses . Leaving this very large house  --  and you and me . For the first time since we got here , Jade , I think I like the odds . " <p> It was tiring , always fighting Court  --  fighting herself actually  --  so Jade gave in . " You forgot Rockne , " she said , smiling as Teddy 's beloved , aging Irish setter snored in front of the cold fireplace . " He 's my chaperon-slash-bodyguard . Rockne ! Sic him , boy ! " <p> Rockne 's left ear twitched a single time , but his eyes did n't open . <p> " I suppose you could go see if Mrs. Archer is available . She 's probably deadly with a rolling pin at twenty paces , " Court suggested . " What do you say , Jade ? Can we put the cases to one side for one night ? Just one ? " <p> Jade returned to the couch and sat down , not to agree with Court , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coffee table . " We 're getting so close , Court . I mean , taking the process of elimination into account , I should be able to wrap this all up in a few days . " <p> " You 're going to wrap this all up in a few days ? Just you ? Who solved the case of the Vanishing Bride ? " <p> " Jolie and Sam , " Jade said , shifting the manila folders on the tabletop . " With a lot of help from Teddy , who nearly had the whole thing wrapped up before he before he was murdered . " <p> " Steady , Jade , " Court said , leaning across the table to squeeze her fingers . " Let 's move on . And the Fishtown Strangler case ? " <p> " Jessica and Matt . Except that 's not completely solved , not if Herman Longstreet is telling the truth about Tarin White not being one of his victims , remember ? " She put a hand to her head . " Sometimes it 's like we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , I do n't want to push this , but every day you look more well , fragile . Your hands look a lot better since the night of the fire , but the burns still have to be tender . You do n't eat enough , I do n't know when you sleep , and when I think maybe you 're taking it easy for a while , I find you in the workout room running on the treadmill . You 've got to slow down , Jade . Stop beating yourself up . " <p> Jade pulled her hand free of his . He was wrong . The burns she 'd gotten trying to put out the fire were completely healed now . It was the rest of her that remained wounded . " That 's just crazy , Court . I 'm not beating myself up . Why would I beat myself up ? " <p> " Oh , I do n't know . Because you did n't come home earlier that night , find Teddy while he was still alive and draining that bottle of Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ? " <p> " Teddy did not kill himself ! " Jade clasped her hands together in her lap because her hands were shaking and , otherwise , Court would see . He already saw too much . <p> " All right . Fine . He did n't kill himself . " Court rubbed at his own forehead now , and Jade suppressed a guilty wince , knowing that he was as tired as she was . They were all tired . <p> " I 'm sorry , Court . I know what it looked like . I was there , remember ? The door to the office closed , Rockne shut outside that door , whining and agitated . The nearly empty bottle of whiskey for liquid courage . Teddy 's body on the other side of that door , slumped back in his chair , the gun on the floor beside him after he'dafter he 'd been shot . I know , Court . I know how it looked . I 'll never forget how it looked . " <p> " And the front door locked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Court added , his voice tight , as if he did n't want to say what he was saying , but likewise , knew that some things had to be said . <p> " I do n't remember " Jade told him . " Honestly , Court , I do n't . Is that it ? Have you been thinking that I lied to you all about that ? About the alarm being on or off , the door locked or unlocked ? Do you think I only said I do n't remember about the security code because otherwise the verdict of suicide is impossible to argue ? How long have you thought I 've been lying ? " <p> " Not lying , Jade . Not intentionally . But sometimes we do forget what we do n't want to remember . " <br> Continues ...
