The Princess Present : A Princess Diaries Book Tuesday , December 22 , Noon , Royal Genovian Bedchamber OH , MY GOD , THEY 'RE COMING ! ! ! ! HERE ! ! ! ! THEY 'RE COMING HERE ! ! ! THEY 'LL BE HERE TOMORROW ! ! ! ! Why am I the only one who CARES ? ? ? ? Grandmre just looked up from her lemon juice and warm water and went , " Prepare the blue and gold wing , please , " to Antoine , the majordomo . AND THAT WAS IT . She is so tied up with planning her Christmas Eve Ball ( royalty from all over the world will be descending on Genovia for it ) , that she ca n't think of anything else . Not that anybody else in the family cares about it . Dad even asked why we could n't just have a quiet family Christmas for a change . Grandmre looked at him with daggers in her eyes and then said , as she sorted through all the RSVPs she 'd gotten in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks we 're going to put up his polo pony while he 's here , he is sadly mistaken . " My dad just sighed and went back to reading The Wall Street Journal . I am telling you , there is something WRONG with my family . " Hello ? That 's it ? " I cried . " The future Prince Michael Moscovitz Renaldo is arriving tomorrow for his first visit ever to the country over which he will one day help me rule , and all you can say is Prepare the blue and gold wing , Antoine ' ? " That got my dad to look out from behind his newspaper . " You two are engaged ? " There was this total crease in the middle of his forehead . Funny how I 've never noticed it before . If I stuck a penny in there , I bet a gum ball would fall out of his mouth . " When did this happen ? " Sadly , I was forced to admit that Michael had not , as yet , proposed . But it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Michael and I share can never be denied  --  no matter what the studios who make all those movies allegedly based on my life might think . " Oh , " my dad said . And lost all interest . The crease completely disappeared . In fact , his whole head disappeared back behind the newspaper . " Fresh cut flowers will be placed in all the rooms in the blue and gold wing , Amelia , " Grandmre said , as she banged on the end of her soft-boiled egg with a silver spoon . " What more do you want ? A gala in the young man 's honor ? As if we do n't have enough to worry about with the Christmas Ball . Why must you obsess so over such inconsequential things ? " Inconsequential ? INCONSEQUENTIAL ? Michael and Lilly 's first ever visit to Genovia is INCONSEQUENTIAL ? I mean , sure , they 're only coming for a week . . . a mere seven days . . . only one hundred and sixty-eight hours . . . . But I 'm trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A week is n't very long to enjoy all the incredible sights this country has to offer . " That 's what Philomena , my dad 's latest girlfriend , had to offer to the breakfast convo . Like this was n't a completely transparent attempt to get in good with my dad . You know , on account of her appreciating his native land so much . Like he was going to throw down his paper and be all , " Philomena , light of my heart , be mine forever ! " because she said you could n't see everything there is to see in his principality in seven days . Whatever . Not that I do n't wholly support a woman 's right to use her god-given assets to get a prince to propose to her , or to make a career out of strutting down a runway in a thong with a pair of wings attached to the straps of her bra . I just , you know , hope she 's socking some of it away in a decent 401(k) or some Roth IRAs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dad 's girlfriends are concerned . " You must be sure to remind Antoine to secure a tuxedo for your young man , " is all Grandmre said . " I do n't want him turning up at the ball in dungarees . And tell Lilly I expect her to have removed all of those horrid friendship bracelets she wears . Straggly pieces of dirt-collecting yarn is what I call them . I wo n't have the Contessa Trevanni thinking my granddaughter 's best friend is a bag lady . " The whole time she was talking , Rommel , Grand-mre 's hairless toy poodle , was totally looking on , so hoping she might drop a crumb or two of the toast she was smearing with soft-boiled egg guts . Because Rommel is on this diet where all he 's allowed to eat is specially formulated dog food . This is on account of the royal vet recently diagnosing him with irritable bowel syndrome . Apparently , the IBS is caused by the antidepressants Rommel is taking to combat his OCD , which manifests itself in his licking all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little friends do n't mind them spending Christmas away from home ? " Philomena asked , all sweetly . " No , " I explained to her , speaking slowly because she 's Danish . And a model . " The Moscovitzes do n't celebrate Christmas . They 're Jewish . " " And they are coming on the Royal Genovian jet ? " Philomena asked , her perfectly plucked eyebrows raised . Because she 'd had to fly commercial to get to the palace  --  first class , but still  --  on account of the jet having been sent to pick up Michael and Lilly . " Certain people , " my dad said from behind the paper , " refused to spend the holidays in Genovia  --  on the grounds that she 'd miss her baby brother 's first Christmas  --  unless certain demands were met . " Philomena looked confused , apparently not realizing my dad was talking about me and the temper tantrum that had finally forced him to send the jet for Lilly and Michael . " But that 's terrible , " Philomena said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America for the holidays than come to this beautiful place ? " Really , I do n't know how I 'm supposed to endure the anti-Americanism that is rampant in this part of the world . Sometimes it just makes my blood boil . But whatever . THEY 'RE COMING ! ! ! ! They 'll be here in twenty-four hours ! ! ! ! I have to get to work if I 'm going to have everything ready for them in time .
