Seattle , Washington <p> " What the hell is that thing supposed to be ? " <p> Cole Warnecki squinted and leaned forward as he tried to come up with words to describe what he was seeing on the monitor . Drawing a complete blank , he shook his head and replied , " I do n't know . Some sort of monster ? " <p> The man next to Cole did n't take his eyes from the thing that had caught his attention . He shook his head , but not in the vaguely bewildered way that Cole had a second ago . " A monster or maybe some kind of alien ? " <p> Cole snapped his fingers . " A demon ! That 's what it is . " <p> " What kind of demon ? " <p> " The kind that . . . wait a second . . . maybe it 's some sort of guardian spirit . " <p> Jason Sorrenson shifted his eyes away from the thirty-two-inch screen , swiveled in his chair so he could face Cole , then reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire frames into the grooves they 'd worn over both ears and onto the bridge of his nose before asking , " Is n't this your game , Cole ? Should n't you know exactly what every one of these things are ? " <p> Cole kept looking at the monitor and the image frozen on it . In his hands he held a controller that was connected to a black video-game console on a table beside Jason 's desk . Finally , Cole set the controller down and pressed his fingertips against his closed eyes . " Shit , you 're right . You know how crazy things get when we 're this close to going gold . " <p> " Going gold ? We 're barely through play testing and you think we 're ready to start manufacturing disks ? " <p> Letting out a breath , Cole flinched as if someone had just blown pepper up his nose . " A Cerberus ! That 's what it is ! " <p> " What ? " <p> " You know , like one of those demon dogs from Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that showed up in  --  " <p> " Save it , Cole . " Jason was in his mid-forties , but carried himself as if he had sixty years of grief on his back . Leaning back , he sunk into the expensive padding of his chair , clasped his hands behind his balding head and stared at Cole through the dated wire frame glasses . His office matched the chair in comfort and had enough windows to fill it with whatever light the gray Seattle skies could offer . In comparison , the rest of the offices in the building seemed like dungeons . Outside , a stiff breeze blew in from Puget Sound ; all the bare branches in the nearby park swayed in a slow rhythm . Winter had n't arrived quite yet , but the city looked plenty cold already . " What 's going on with you lately ? " Jason asked with more concern than might be expected from someone so high on the corporate ladder . <p> Cole was about ten years younger than his boss , but he let out a sigh as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way through the ranks of Digital Dreamers Inc. had been a labor of love , but times like this did n't feel so romantic . " I do n't know , " he said before his pause became uncomfortable . <p> " Do you want to abandon Hammer Strike ? " <p> Glancing back to the monitor , Cole looked at the pause screen displaying the game 's title and options . " I 've been working on Hammer for over two years . Giving it up now would just be . . . " <p> " Lazy ? " <p> " I was going to say stupid , but I guess both are pretty close . " <p> Jason got up and sat on the edge of his marble desktop . " I 'd hate to lose you , Cole , " he said while picking up his own controller and hitting a button to put the game back into motion . " You 're anything but lazy , but you do seem sort of distracted . " <p> " That 's putting it nicely . It feels more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Chuckling under his breath like a preteen boy too nervous to follow up his friend 's swearing with a bad word of his own , Jason let his fingers drift effortlessly over the game controller . He moved his muscle-bound , onscreen avatar to one of the Cerberus-type creatures and used the titular hammer to pound it into a mess of pixilated gore . <p> Cole pinched his chin between a thumb and forefinger while watching Jason maneuver through the game . " Do that combo I showed you . " <p> " The killing move ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> Jason 's fingers flew through the prescribed set of motions , causing the digitized character to perform a jerky dance . " It 's not working , " he said while shaking his head . <p> Cole took the controller from Jason 's hands and went through the same motions , only a bit faster . After a few more attempts , he bounced the controller off the floor and turned his back to the screen . " God dammit ! " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . relax a little ? " <p> " I ca n't take a vacation this close to the release date . " <p> " So we 'll push the date back . It would n't be the first time . " <p> Letting out a breath , Cole straightened up and turned around to face his boss again . He knew he might not have been in the best shape of his life , but with his natural athleticism , he held up better than most guys his age . Considering how much time he spent in front of a computer screen , his lack of a gut was even more impressive . He chuckled at his own expense and dropped back into his chair . " I do n't think a vacation is what I need , Jason . " <p> " I 'm not letting you quit . " Lighting up like the power button on his game console , Jason said , " I know ! What about Nora ? " <p> " I have n't seen her for a while . " <p> " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must see her every day . " <p> " I mean I have n't seen her . . . like that . Not for a while . " <p> Jason nodded slowly . " Why not ? " <p> " Not just a boss , but a relationship counselor too ? I think you should prescribe me some painkillers . You know , the good ones that put you to sleep for a while ? " <p> <br> Continues ...
