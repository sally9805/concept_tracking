<p> If St. Augustine were alive to observe the upcoming Denver election , he would understand the mixed message now being sent by civic leaders fighting to end a costly cycle of neglect of the city 's basic infrastructure . <p> The great theologian , a libertine in his youth , once famously prayed : " Oh lord , grant me continence - but not just yet . " <p> Denver has long skimped on maintenance of its $5 billion in sewers , parks , overpasses , buildings and other assets . Every 10 years or so , things get so bad that the politicians ask voters for a bond issue to repair that crumbling infrastructure . <p> This week , Denver voters will start receiving their mail-only ballots . Mayor John Hickenlooper and his allies are pleading for voters to end the cycle of neglect and catch up by approving issue 1A - a 2.5 mill property tax increase to raise $27.5 million a year , all of which would be earmarked for future maintenance of city facilities . <p> But like St. Augustine , Hickenlooper ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . " That 's because past neglect has again saddled the city with a backlog of urgently needed repairs estimated at $350 million . Thus , the ballot also includes eight separate bond issues , 1B through 1I , to repair decayed facilities . Interwoven with those catch-up monies are $200 million worth of new or upgraded facilities , including branch libraries in Stapleton , Green Valley Ranch and west Denver , new recreation centers in Stapleton and central Denver , a new crime lab , and traffic upgrades . <p> Proof of the wisdom of routine maintenance is as close as your nearest pothole . Denver divides its streets into four categories : excellent , good , fair and poor . <p> Public Works Director Bill Vidal says " fair " is the critical rating , because it means cracks are beginning to show . On a quiet residential street , that means it 's time to chip and seal the pavement at a cost of about $2.50 per square yard . A higher volume street like Sixth Avenue can be rotomilled and overlaid at a still reasonable $10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get that maintenance when it needs it , water will attack the surface in a vicious freeze/thaw cycle that will shatter the base pavement in two or three years . Then , it costs a staggering $80 to $120 a square yard to rebuild the asphalt or concrete pavement . A mile of two-lane street that could have been maintained for as little as $17,600 to $70,400 will now cost taxpayers as much as $840,000 to rebuild . <p> Preventive maintenance is n't glamorous , but it is the acid test of how elected officials serve as stewards of taxpayers ' money . <p> By that standard , Denver has n't done well since the days of the legendary Mayor Robert Speer . The city does have $44.5 million in its current capital improvement budget , most of it spent on maintenance . But a special committee named by Hickenlooper concluded the city is still postponing about $25.4 million annually in maintenance . That report led directly to Issue 1A , a special fund legally earmarked to augment , not replace , existing maintenance efforts . <p> The owner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extra $50.75 a year if 1A passes . If all eight bond issues are approved , that homeowner will pay an additional $12.53 annually , for a total tax increase of $63.27 . <p> Skeptics are critical <p> The prospect of two tax increases in one election has some skeptics questioning issue 1H , which provides $40 million to expand Boettcher Hall , home of the Denver Symphony , and $30 million to upgrade the popular Denver Museum of Science and Nature . Denver 's property tax base has grown enough so that it could support $480 million in new bonds without a mill levy increase . Hence , defeating 1H would avert the need for the second , $12.53 , tax hike , critics say . <p> Mathematically , that 's indisputable . But the same is true about any other projects on the ballot that would total $70 million or more . Defeating 1E , for example , would trim $93.4 million while killing plans to repair existing park facilities and build the two new recreational centers . <p> Business leaders back the Museum of Nature and Science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only issues on the ballot that bring new money into Denver . <p> Nobody expects tourists to drive in from Akron to gaze in awe at the new police firing range funded by issue 1E . But visitors do throng to the museum and symphony , providing jobs and tax revenues in Denver 's thriving hospitality industry . <p> As an extra bonus , 1H is heavily leveraged with private funds . If Denver taxpayers approve the $70 million seed money , backers of the museum and symphony have pledged to raise an additional $145 million , matching Denver 's dollars more than two to one . No other item on the ballot includes such private matching funds .  --  Nov. 6 election What 's a better Denver worth ? 1A <p> What it is : Capital <p> maintenance <p> mill levy of $27.5 million for the restoration , rehabilitation , refurbishment or replacement of capital infrastructure , including parks , public works , buildings and other public facilities . <p> Where the money would go : It 's a 2.5 mill increase in the city 's tax levy , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homeowner $50.75 a year . <p> 1B <p> What it is : Health and human services facilities bonds of $43.6 million for improvements to Denver Health ; renovations to child care centers ; and replacing the Denver Municipal Animal Shelter and Eastside Human Services . <p> Where the money would go : <p> Denver Municipal Animal Shelter , $18.1 million <p> Child care centers at Lowry ( $91,000 ) , Neighborhood House and Westside ( $743,000 ) , Westwood Child Development ( $3.5 million ) and Edna Oliver and Northeast centers ( $753,000 ) . <p> Eastside Human Services , $19.5 million <p> Denver Health , fifth-floor expansion , $5.8 million <p> 1C <p> What it is : Library system facilities bonds of $51.9 million for projects including deferred maintenance on existing facilities and constructing new branch facilities . <p> Where the money would go : <p> Denver Public Library maintenance , $14.4 million <p> New branch libraries in West Denver , Stapleton and Green Valley Ranch , $37.5 million <p> 1D <p> What it is : Streets , transportation and public works system facilities bonds of $99.8 million for repairing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; repairing sound walls ; repairing and/or replacing curbs and gutters ; improving transit stop connections , street- <p> scapes and upgrading medians ; and building a Cherry Creek Solid Waste facility . <p> Where the money would go , among 25 projects : <p> Cherry Creek Solid Waste office annex , $2.6 million <p> Reconstruction of streets damaged last winter , $50 million <p> I-25/Broadway interchange reconstruction , $15 million <p> 1E <p> What it is : Park system facilities bonds of $93.4 million for maintenance , rehabilitation , restoration , repair and/or replacement of drainage and irrigation systems ; pools ; historic structures and features , playground and building systems ; landscapes ; trails , roads and parking lots ; and acquisition , design and development of land , park and recreation centers . <p> Where the money would go , among 22 projects : <p> Irrigation replacement , $17.1 million <p> New recreation center at Stapleton , $10.4 million <p> Restoration of historic features of Civic Center , $9.8 million <p> 1F <p> What it is : Public office facilities bonds of $10.4 million for deferred maintenance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the former City Permit Center . <p> Where the money would go : <p> Maintenance to City and County Building , $7.2 million <p> Repairs to Permit Center , $3.1 million <p> 1G <p> What it is : Deferred maintenance for cultural facilities bonds of $60.5 million for restoration , rehabilitation , refurbishment or replacement of capital infrastructure , including parks , public works , buildings and other public facilities . <p> Where the money would go : <p> Botanic Gardens maintenance , enhancements , $18.6 million <p> Boettcher Concert Hall maintenance , $20.7 million <p> Champa Street corridor improvements to auditorium and Buell Theatre , adding rehearsal space , $2 million <p> Denver Museum of Nature &; Science maintenance , $19.2 million <p> 1H <p> What it is : New construction of cultural facilities bonds of $70 million , for new construction of cultural system facilities , including classrooms , labs , a teacher education center and other facilities for the Denver Museum of Nature &; Science ; and the reconstruction and expansion of the Boettcher Concert Hall . <p> Where the money would go : <p> Boettcher Concert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Science construction , remodeling , $30 million <p> 1I <p> What it is : Public safety system facilities bonds of $65 million for construction , renovation or replacement of a police crime lab , firing range , fire stations and police traffic operations facility . <p> Where the money would go : <p> Fire station renovations , $30 million <p> Police traffic operations and firing range relocation , $13.5 million <p> Replacement of police crime lab , $39.3 million
