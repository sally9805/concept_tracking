Do n't Do It // * * * // Nicolas Cage // He 's still very sensitive about the perception that he 's wacky , because his performance is n't that . It 's all hard work . Nothing in it is arbitrary . Mike Figgis , director of Leaving Las Vegas , to Steve Daly , Entertainment Weekly , March 15 , 1996 // Nicolas Cage might be as famous for his obsessive preparation as he is for the riveting performances he gives as a result of it . Cage has starred in both lighthearted comedies and weighty dramas , brooding independent films and big-budget action blockbusters . His best-known movies include Leaving Las Vegas ( for which he won an Oscar ) , The Cotton Club , Rumble Fish , and Peggy Sue Got Married ( all directed by his uncle Francis Ford Coppola ) , Birdy , Moonstruck , Raising Arizona , It Could Happen to You , Red Rock West , The Rock , and Con Air . But everyone has his or her own favorites among Cage 's movies-even if no one else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Kiss and Amos &amp; Andrew . // What appears below combines questions and answers from each of Cage 's two visits to Fresh Air . Our first conversation was in 1990 , when Cage was promoting David Lynch 's Wild at Heart . We spoke again in 2002 , when Cage starred in Windtalkers , a film about World War II directed by John Woo , who had also directed him in Face/Off five years earlier . // TERRY GROSS : You 've watched yourself die time and time again in movies . Does it put you in touch with the inevitability of your own death ? Do you take it personally when you see yourself die in a movie ? // NICOLAS CAGE : Well , I see it very much as a performance . My own feelings about death are almost Japanese in thinking . There is a samurai philosophy that you have to earn your right to die . Death has always been sort of a friend to me , because I 've never ignored the fact that it 's going to happen , I 'm very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wear on my shoulder that says , " Get to work , because you only have so much time . " // TG : Is that an attitude you 've worked on or one that just came naturally to you ? // CAGE : It started when I was about fifteen . I remember that I did n't really believe in heaven or hell at that time . But I did believe in death . So I made a vow to myself that if I could achieve certain goals in my life that I would be okay with my death . I 've since changed my views somewhat , but I do n't see death as a horrible thing . // You know , there 's a 50 percent chance it could be really amazing , because no one really knows what it is . I had to go through my will the other day with my attorney , and questions came up like , " What is it that you want if , God forbid , you 're in a car accident ? Do you want to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plug ? " And I 'm , like , " God , I 've got to think about this . " But I said , " Well , you know , I hear coma 's not a bad place , so maybe not , but what I do know is that I do n't want to be bombed out of my skull on some massive dose of morphine . If I go into the next life , I want to go in aware . If there is a next life , I 'd like to be aware . " So I had them write that down . // TG : Do n't you think , though , you might want the pain dulled if- // CAGE : Yeah . I mean , that 's the tricky part . Remember those Buddhists that set themselves on fire during the Vietnam War ? How do they get to that point to be so in control of their state to not even flinch when they 're burning to death ? I think it 's a life 's work to actually prepare yourself for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about death in any way connected to your approach to acting ? Do you see acting as an altered state , or an act of willed consciousness ? // CAGE : It 's strange . I do see it as an altered state . I think that 's a good way of putting it . As crazy as it sounds , I almost see it like channeling spirits . // TG : You 've been in a couple of films directed by John Woo . You 've said about Woo 's films that even though there is " a lot of death in them , there 's also the notion of being closer to God . " Do you ever wish that you could have that kind of faith , too ? Maybe you have it . Maybe I am making an assumption . // CAGE : No , I do have faith . I believe in God , and I am a Christian . // TG : I know that you 've gone to extremes to develop that altered state of consciousness to get into a role . // CAGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through trial and error . Sometimes I fell on my face . Sometimes it worked . I started when I was seventeen , and I really did n't have that much training . So I did all the things that I 'd heard the other great actors had done , like staying up all night to do a scene the next day to look tired . In Cotton Club I was playing a crazy gangster who was very feared in Harlem . I would walk down the street in New York and really believe I was this psychotic killer . I brought all that stuff to the scene . And it worked . But needless to say , I was n't liked very much . I mean , I do have a life . I do n't really want to live the part anymore . So I stopped doing that . I realized I could get there without all that intense " living the role " kind of a thing . // TG : What did you do when you were taking the " living the role " thing to extremes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Christopher Street , and there was a guy selling remote-control cars for fifty bucks , and I said , " Let me see that . " I put it in the middle of the street , and I jumped on it and smashed it . All the pieces were flying around . All the people just scattered , saying , " Oh , you 're crazy . " I did give the guy fifty bucks for his car , hut it helped me believe that I could create fear in people-which is what that character did in the movie . // TG : Before that , you had no confidence that you were capable of generating fear in people ? // CAGE : Well , I 'm not a violent guy . I 'm not a fighter . When I was playing that role , I was young . I was experimenting with trying to evoke fear , so that I could believe it in myself for the character . But I 've learned that it 's not necessary . It 's a lot more creative and thoughtful to just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit about Vampire 's Kiss . This is the movie where you are the cockroach . It 's a wonderful film . You play a character who 's a very obnoxious literary agent . After he 's bitten by a woman he sleeps with , he starts to believe that she is a vampire and that he is turning into one . He shrinks at the sign of the cross and asks people to put a stake through his heart to take him out of his misery . It 's an incredibly original performance . You must have watched all the new and old horror films to get the classic vampire gestures for the movie . // CAGE : Well . I was exposed to the movie Nosferatu at a very early age because my father was teaching film . The original Nosferatu , starring Max Schreck , the black-and-white , silent vampire movie , gave me nightmares for years . Those images , especially his body language , his gestures and movements , stayed with me . I always thought it would be great to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They used their bodies more because they had to compensate for the lack of sound . // With Vampire 's Kiss , I saw an opportunity to explore that German Expressionist style of acting , like in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari . I figured the only way I could pull it off was if the character was insane , because you ca n't really act like that in modern film in a normal format . People just would n't get it . But if the character is insane , and especially if he thinks he 's turning into a vampire , there 's a wonderful landscape of things you can do . So I brought those old-style gestures to the character . // TG : Let 's get to the cockroach-eating sequence . There 's a scene where you are in your kitchen , after you 've concluded you 're turning into a vampire . There 's a cockroach crawling across the burner of the stove . You scoop it up in your hand and eat it . We do n't see you swallow it in the movie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no edit , so it 's definitely the real thing that 's gone into your mouth . // CAGE : Yeah , definitely the real thing . Originally , they wanted me to eat raw eggs , and that did n't do anything for me. // TG : Sylvester Stallone had already done that . // CAGE : Yeah , exactly . And I wanted to tie in the Renfield thing-Renfield from the Dracula novel where he was eating the bugs and stuff . // TG : Renfield is Dracula 's assistant . He 's in an insane asylum and he eats insects . // CAGE : Right . And it was a slow progression for my character , Peter Loew . First he 's eating pistachios , then he 's eating a cockroach , then he finally eats the dove . Ultimately he bites a girl 's neck , kills her , and drinks her blood . So it was this progressive building from pistachio to girl . The cockroach was one of the steps in the disintegration of Peter Loew. // So I said , " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You 've got to be crazy ! " And I said , " Yeah , I-I know what you mean . I really do n't like cockroaches myself . " They wrangled up three New York cockroaches out of somebody 's basement , and the day arrived where I had to do it . I saw the bug when I walked on the set . The legs were kicking . The antennas were going . It looked huge . I almost said , " Guys , I ca n't do it . " I figured that it would be a cop-out , because I 'd set it up and made them wrangle for cockroaches for weeks . // I put the cockroach close to me . Every muscle in my body was saying , " Do n't do it . " The wings were going . And then I-I did it . And-I could n't sleep for about three days . I could n't eat . But well , I did it . And there it is. // TG : Did you call a doctor first and ask if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . They said it would be okay . What I did was I rinsed my mouth out with hundred-proof vodka and sterilized my mouth before I did it . And then when I spit the cockroach out , I sterilized my mouth again . // TG : What did it taste like ? // CAGE : Oh , you know , I could n't remember . All I know is it was soft . It was not crunchy . It was soft . And it was-it was just a nightmare . // TG : Did it ever come back and haunt you ? // CAGE : When I talk about it like this and I start thinking about it , I get goose bumps . I 'm starting to get the willies again . // TG : There are at least two different threads to your career : one , the more action-oriented roles , and the other , the more introspective roles like Leaving Las Vegas or Red Rock West . Did you ever expect to become an action hero when you started acting ? Were you ever physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were young ? // CAGE : I always liked action films as a boy , but I was probably the last person on the list for starring in an action movie , even though I wanted to . I had heroes like Clint Eastwood and Sean Connery , who I was lucky to work with in The Rock . // I always saw it as escapist entertainment , which to me is just as valuable as the thought-provoking and introspective work that actors do in art films or indie films , because , to be honest with you , there are times when I do n't want to think . I just want to get my mind off my problems , and have my popcorn and escape . // To answer your question , I was not someone who was perceived as action material , and then Jerry Bruckheimer cast me in The Rock . But even so , I was playing a nerd who becomes an action hero . I was trying to build my foreign market up , and I thought more people would see the work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do something with action movies ? Just because it 's a genre picture does n't mean you ca n't create a character . " // What I found was that I have to be very quick on my feet and very succinct about what it is I want to say , because it is a formula . They want to get to the car chase or to the explosion , so whatever acting you do , you 've got to do it fast , which is frustrating , but it 's also good training . It does distill your acting down to the precise essence of the character . // TG : Since becoming an action hero , you 've had to change your body , pump up a lot . Has it also changed your sense of self ? // CAGE : Well , no . Actually , the truth of the matter is that I 've always been physical . I started working out when I was twelve years old . // TG : What motivated you to do that when you were so young ? // CAGE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I got addicted to it . It became a place where I could put my anger . As a young boy growing up , I had a lot of anger that needed to be directed of focused , and working out helped me with that . To this day , I 've used exercise as a place to sort of clear my head and relax , although I do prefer to look trim . // TG : The movie you received an Academy Award for , Leaving Las Vegas , was based on a story by a writer who was so depressed that he killed himself before the movie was made . Could you comprehend that level of depression ? // CAGE : Well , I made a choice early on in the rehearsal process that I was n't going to play him depressed , because I always felt that there 's nothing sadder than a person who 's in a sad situation and does n't know it . Consequently , I thought that Ben Sanderson-even though the truth is that he is so depressed that he 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he 'd be smiling and laughing a lot . I thought that would make it even more sad . // I saw Ben as somebody who had let go and was not afraid to die , and therefore , he could do anything . He was going to have four weeks to do it , and he was going to have one big party ; and he was responsible about it . He cashed out . He cleared his debts , and he was n't going to be a burden to anybody anymore . He was n't going to be a burden to his boss . In fact , he feels bad that he upset his boss . // TG : I read that your mother suffered from depression . My guess is that she was n't the kind of wisecracking depressive that your character is in Leaving Las Vegas . Did your experience of her depression inform your performance ? // CAGE : Oh , yeah . I mean , I 'm sure it did . I think there are moments in the movie where I watch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But these are things that happen almost by accident . I do n't think about it . // TG : Your character is drunk during a lot of Leaving Las Vegas . Did you drink while preparing for the role in order to get a sense of what goes on mechanically when you 've had a lot to drink ? // CAGE : I did , in fact , drink on a couple scenes in that movie because I wanted it to be extremely real . I would drink on my own and then videotape myself getting drunk so that I could see what I was like . Then I destroyed the videotape , but I would use that experience as a way to get into the character . //
