<p> TAMPA  --  " On the whole , I 'd rather be in Philadelphia . " <p> W.C. Fields ' famous epitaph speaks to and for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers . <p> There are places they 'd rather be , and one of them is San Diego , for Super Bowl XXXVII . But the only way to get there is through the City of Brotherly Love , with a victory against their arch-nemeses , the Philadelphia Eagles , in the last NFL game at dank and dingy Veterans Stadium . <p> The Vet . Where the Bucs ' last two seasons ended with bitter playoff losses . The cold , old , loud , hostile Vet . <p> Of all places . For all things . <p> " It 's ironic , " Bucs cornerback Ronde Barber acknowledged in a locker room hip-deep in quiet confidence . " But I ca n't think of a better place to try and win the NFC championship . " <p> The Bucs secured that right by pounding the San Francisco 49ers 31-6 Sunday in a divisional playoff matchup . Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to score a touchdown in their last three postseason games , the Bucs went against all form and set a club playoff record for points in a game . . . by halftime ( with 28 ) . <p> The spate of touchdowns , the colorful flags in the stands , the home game after a bye week and the sudden sprint to a huge halftime lead lent a sizzle to the crisp afternoon air and underscored the Bucs ' sense of purpose . <p> " It was an electric atmosphere , " defensive tackle Warren Sapp said . " And we tapped in . " <p> The Bucs ( 13-4 ) won on offense , on defense and with special teams . They rolled up 329 yards , forced five turnovers while sacking the hapless Jeff Garcia four times and turned 49ers ' special-teams errors into points and field position . They won a playoff game for the first time since Jan. 15 , 2000 , bearing out the decision by ownership to pony up $ 8 million and four high draft picks for the right to acquire Jon Gruden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 49ers finished 11-7 , their sack of comeback miracles emptied last week in their wild-card win against the New York Giants . <p> " We pointed that out at halftime , that they seem to like coming from behind and they are capable of doing that , " Gruden said . " But we also pointed out that we like closing games out . " <p> Their reward for rolling over the 49ers is another shot at the Eagles , who beat them in the playoffs each of the last two seasons and 20-10 in October at the Vet . The playoff loss a year ago finalized the departure of coach Tony Dungy , whose steady tenure brought the club from the NFL 's lower echelon to the upper strata while falling just short of the ultimate expectation . <p> " There was a lot of turmoil , a lot of speculation , " safety John Lynch said as he recalled that tumultuous week of a year ago . <p> The 31-9 loss last Jan. 12 came with Tampa Bay management 's plan to court Bill Parcells exploding in the media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the embarrassed Bucs spent more than a month chasing nearly every potential candidate , from then-Baltimore defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis to University of Maryland coach Ralph Friedgen to the 49ers ' Steve Mariucci . <p> As Mariucci slept on the Bucs ' offer and weighed the impact of a cross-country move on his family , the sons of Bucs owner Malcolm Glazer took a midnight run at Gruden , who grew up in Tampa and still has family here . Before Mariucci could say yes or no , the Bucs said goodbye and pried Gruden from the Raiders with a king 's ransom of draft picks ( two No. 1s , two No. 2s ) and cash . <p> They wanted some fire , some enthusiasm , some offense . On the cusp of the franchise 's third appearance in a conference championship game , they should be as satisfied with the return on their investment as their paying customers seemed to be . <p> " This , " quarterback Brad Johnson said , " is what the fans wanted with Jon Gruden coming here . " <p> Defense still paramount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Niners , they hardly became the offensive juggernaut Grudenites anticipated in Year 1 of the revolution . <p> Injuries along the line and shared duties at running back limited the ground game . The lack of speed among receivers cut into the routes Gruden hoped to run . Johnson held things together with precision throws and a distaste for turnovers , but in the early going the Bucs ' new offense hardly seemed more productive than the one that got Dungy dismissed . <p> Defense won for the Bucs . Always had , always will . That 's where the club invested most of its high draft choices and a lot of its salary-cap dollars and that 's the strength it played to . <p> The Bucs led the NFL in total defense , rushing defense and scoring defense , and linebacker Derrick Brooks won NFL defensive player of the year honors . <p> In a league gone mad with offense and passing , it 's fitting the NFC title matchup features the NFL 's top-rated defenses . <p> " That 's one thing the man who raised us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lynch said . " Whatever happens in this league , it will always come down to defense winning championships . " <p> The Bucs offense actually began to take flight after the debacle in Philadelphia in October . Johnson missed the final two games of the regular season with a back injury but threw 15 touchdown passes and just one interception in the six he played before that . <p> What the Bucs accomplished in one season and what the finished product ultimately will look like are not even close . <p> " Jon has a great system . He 's very thorough and he gets everyone involved . He understands what defenses can do and knows how to attack them , " said Johnson , adding he expected the offense to peak later in the season as players grew accustomed to the scheme and each other . <p> Perhaps that will alleviate the scoring drought that plagues the Bucs in that special zone known as " a game away from the Super Bowl . " <p> One last game at the Vet <p> In 1979 , their fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NFC title game and lost 9-0 at home to the Los Angeles Rams . Twenty years later , against the transplanted Rams in St. Louis , they fell 11-6 . <p> They 're looking for their first touchdown in " a game away from the Super Bowl , " in hopes of finally getting there . <p> Gruden was offensive coordinator in Philadelphia in 1995-97 but said he remembers little about the city other than his early-morning commutes and his late-night drives home . The noted workaholic might never have seen it in the full light of day , but he guaranteed the Bucs would show up " and play any place , whether it be in the Vet or on the Walt Whitman Bridge . " <p> Try the bridge . The stadium is backed up . <p> After all the unpleasantness , maybe it would be better to stay off the bridge . No touchdowns in either playoff game . A coach fired who was much beloved . Loss after loss after loss . <p> " We have to go in there with the mind-set that we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive tackle Roman Oben said of facing the Eagles . " It 's really a ' loser goes home ' this time . We 're playing for the chance of a lifetime . " <p> This is the chance they asked for . <p> " They 're coming back north and they did n't like the outcome of the last game , " Eagles cornerback Troy Vincent said , " and they spoke candidly about that . " <p> Now it 's Bucs-Eagles again , in the last NFL game at the Vet before the Eagles move across the street to a $ 540 million stadium . <p> " If you can get it done here , you 're going to San Diego , " Eagles defensive end Hugh Douglas said . " We both know that . " <p> Last licks . Winner goes to the Super Bowl . The Bucs have never been there , and the Eagles have never won it . The Eagles made the Vet a feared venue ( and their nutty fans helped ) ; the Bucs have struggled there and in cold weather in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for a situation I 've never been in . If you consider yourself one of the best , you want this game , " Bucs defensive end Simeon Rice said . " This is when we show what we 're all about , exorcise those demons . We want this . "
