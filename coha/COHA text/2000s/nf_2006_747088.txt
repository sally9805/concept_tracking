A three semester , within instructor , interrupted time series analysis of grading practices was conducted in order to observe the effects of the implementation of a plus minus grading system . Over 260 individual instructor 's grades were compared before and after implementation of plus minus grading . The results indicate no overall effect of the grading practice on average student grades at the college . Plus minus grading seems to have no impact on grade inflation or grade deflation . <p> The impact of plus minus grading policies on student grades is a topic which has been debated at several colleges and universities in the United States sine the 19990 's ( Gosselin , 1197 ; Riley et . al. , 1996 ; Baker and Bates , 1999 ) . <p> Quann ( 1987 ) , reports that in a study conducted at Washington State University that student acceptance of the plus minus system was strong and that most faculty appear to be satisfied with the system . He also concludes that the plus minus grading option may have also helped to reduce grade inflation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade changes made by faculty after submission to double after plus minus grading was adopted . Similarly , Bressette ( 2002 ) , reports that grade inflation was reduced as a result of plus minus grading . <p> An interesting study investigating this issue from the student 's perspective was conducted by Dixon ( 2004 ) in which students chose whether they would receive a traditional A through F letter grade or a plus minus grade ( excluding A+ and D- ) . In this study over two thirds of the students chose the traditional option , yet those who chose the plus minus option earned a much higher proportion of B grades ( 40% ) to D grades ( 5.7% ) than did those students who chose traditional grading . In this group , 27.9% earned a B while 15.6% received a D. <p> The Richard Stockton College of New Jersey is a medium size public college which enrolls about 6000 FTE undergraduates and 260 FTE students in post baccalaureate training . <p> Last year , our college switched from a whole letter grade system to a plus minus grading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D- . A grade ob B is assigned a value of 3.0 , with plus and minus increments of .3 . There is no A+ available , and a D- represents a marginally passing grade with a numerical equivalent of .7 . <p> Among the issues debated was whether the use of the plus minus grading option would exacerbate the general trend towards grade inflation , cause grade deflation , of simply give faculty a finer metric yet have no effect on average grade <p> We thought the change in practice from a whole grade letter system to that of plus minus grading would allow for a rather interesting comparison of the effects of the option on assessment of college student performance . The change was debated for hours in our Faculty Assembly which functions much like the traditional Faculty Senate except that all faculty at the college serve as Assembly Members and vote on all Academic policies . <p> The Plus-Minus grade policy was adopted by the Faculty Assembly , the Academic Provost , and the Board of Trustees of the College and was implemented in the fall of 2004 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains the purview of the individual faculty members as has been the practice associated with the assignment of academic grades at most colleges and universities . The decision to assign an individual 's grade remains the sole digression of the person teaching the course . <p> The present investigation compares the grading practices of those faculty who taught the same course both before and after the change to the plus minus grade rules and who choose to utilize the new plus minus grading system . We were interested in observing whether the introduction of plus minus grading practices would result in a net increase or decrease of average grades . We were also interested in whether the form of the final grade distributions would change . The present study is well controlled in that both the course and the instructor are held constant . <p> Data were collected from college grade records for all faculty at the college who taught the same course over three sequential fall semesters during the regular academic year . The first two semesters in the analysis were those in which plus minus grading was not used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minus grading . Only full time faculty were used in this investigation and only traditional face to face lecture and recitation courses were included in the analysis . We collected two semesters prior to the introduction of plus minus grading in order to develop an estimate of the stability of faculty grading practices . The comparison of these grades with those following plus minus grading can be considered a natural experiment . <p> The results of this investigation are unambiguous and startlingly clear . The advent of plus-minus grading had no effect on the average grade earned by students at the college . This is true on a college wide basis as well as for the smaller divisional units of the college . Index 02 , 03 and 04 correspond to the GPA from all classes during fall 2002 , fall 2003 and fall 2004 semesters . The comparison of Index 02 with Index 03 , made in order to assess stability of grades , shows clear evidence of stability , t(261)=1.486 , ns . Comparisons of the Index04 with those of 02 and 03 also show no significant changes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 261 ) = - .385 , ns . The averages are shown in Table 1 , below . <p> It is clear that the introduction of plus minus grading had no affect on the average grades assigned by faculty . What is not addressed in the present investigation is the motivation affects , if any , of plus minus grading on student performance , the perceived fairness of the system , and the ease of use by faculty . Clearly , however , in the aggregate , there is not evidence of grade inflation or deflation resulting from the implementation of plus minus grading . Further , the form of the overall grade distribution did not change throughout the three semesters of comparison .
