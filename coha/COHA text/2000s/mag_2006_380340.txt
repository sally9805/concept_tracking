In Albert Brooks ' latest directorial project , Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World , the U.S. government sends the funnyman to South Asia and he almost starts World War III . <P> There was controversy over the film 's title . People being afraid of the word Muslim is the reason I made the movie . It does n't attack religious beliefs . There are R-rated sex comedies that are far more offensive . <P> You were nervous about screening it in Dubai . Did you really think Arabs were that uptight ? When we turn on the TV , there are people saying that everyone there hates America . So what did I know ? But they were one of the best comedy audiences I 've ever had . They were grateful to see an American movie where Muslims were n't the bad guys . I do n't know why this country does n't do more on a human-to-human basis around the world . We can still bomb them if that 's what we choose , but it would n't hurt to take a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India , a country of Hindus ? This is dealt with in a scene . A government official tells me , " There are over 150 million Muslims in India . That enough for ya ? " Even if I wanted to shoot in the Arab world , I was n't able to . <P> Did you film in Pakistan ? I 'm not going to say . We were near the border , and we might have stepped in . <P> So what makes Muslims laugh ? The Muslims on my crew told me Sikh jokes like " How many Sikhs does it take to play a game of chess ? " I had a Hindu driver , and guess what he told me : Muslim jokes .
