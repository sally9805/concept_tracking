All too many times in the past , intelligence reports of terrorist plans  --  even against specific targets  --  have failed to prevent horrific strikes . In 1983 , we had a number of reports that terrorists were targeting the U.S. Marine compound in Beirut . On Oct. 23 , 1983 , 241 U.S. soldiers were killed . <P> Intelligence reports that are detailed enough to act upon  --  like those that helped thwart recent plots against our embassies in Paris and Singapore  --  are unusual . That fact of life is frustrating to intelligence officers and Presidents . <P> It was inevitable that as the months passed after Sept. 11 , reports , memos and speculations would be found that , in retrospect , would seem to have provided early warning  --  if only someone had connected the dots . While some pre-9/11 items of intelligence today seem like red flags , pulling together incomplete or ambiguous fragments of information into a credible and compelling analysis is more difficult than the Monday-morning quarterbacks would have you think . Especially doing so convincingly enough to prompt high-level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 was structural . Since 1986 , representatives of a number of national security organizations and the FBI have worked together daily in the CIA 's Counterterrorism Center , where information from abroad is shared , integrated , analyzed and acted upon . Before Sept. 11 , there was no comparable formal organization for working-level contact among the domestic agencies of government  --  or between them and the national security agencies . While there appear to have been a few dots to connect , there was no effective mechanism for those connecting lines to cross domestic and national security boundaries . <P> Only at the NSC level did the two sides of the government come together regularly to share information . In the aftermath of the tragedy , the Office of Homeland Security has set about creating a central organization in which information can be brought together , analyzed and , if appropriate , acted on . <P> Before Sept. 11 , we were a different country , and Washington was a different city , where turf issues prevailed and concern about CIA and FBI " overreaching " trumped concern for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , as is Washington 's way , blame will be attributed . However , for the future , a thoughtful , balanced congressional inquiry can identify the pre-Sept. 11 structural and bureaucratic impediments to information sharing and better coordination across the government , and can recommend changes that improve our defenses against terrorism . But using fragments of information as ammunition against the President , the CIA , the FBI and others  --  absent context  --  will only delay tackling the real problems . <P> Gates was CIA director under President George H.W.
