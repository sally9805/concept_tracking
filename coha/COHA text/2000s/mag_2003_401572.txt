Have you ever become so involved in an activity that you lost all sense of time , worries wilted away , and stress disappeared ? If so , you were probably either in love or immersed in a keen interest-a passion or hobby that helped you to get outside yourself . Such idealized moments are available to each of us . All we need to do is engage ourselves in a pastime and stay involved . Whether volunteering at a local hospital , growing heirloom roses , singing in a choir , or collecting stamps post-marked from post offices all across the country , passionate pursuits not only benefit the people who pursue them , but also those around them . Passions are contagious-they have a way of rousing even the most languid souls . " Every hobby teaches you something , " says Susan Sheehan , author of The Banana Sculptor , the Purple Lady , and the All-Night Swimmer : Hobbies , Collecting , and Other Passionate Pursuits ( Simon &; Schuster ; $14 ) .

" Their interests stimulate their brains and this gets their bodies moving . " He asserts that the brain , just like the muscles in our bodies , needs exercise-especially once aging begins and movement slows . To prove his point , in April 2002 he and his wife ran in pursuit of their passion : They became the first married couple over 70 ever to finish the Boston Marathon .

Dyer , counseling psychologist and author of 10 Secrets for Success and Inner Peace ( Hay House ; $12,95 ) , outlines steps for those who want to become more passionate or engaged in life .
