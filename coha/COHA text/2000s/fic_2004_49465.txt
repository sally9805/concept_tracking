The sun goes down , and out they come-the phone perverts-like hairy-pawed werewolves roaming the darkened landscape of the Arkansas ( 501 ) calling area , their collective anxiety burning through telephone wires from Sweet Home to Sheraton Park . At the Little Rock Marriott Renaissance Hotel alone , one out of every eighty-two calls received on the nightshift by the inhouse reservations desk is from a phone pervert , or a " caller using inappropriate or sexually graphic language , " as the Orientation Manual for New Reservations Agents puts it . The average figure was determined years before by some undergraduate psychology major working for the summer , or by an overzealous assistant manager of sales , or by some part-timer red in the face with the number of times each week she had to hear about the enormity of some anonymous caller 's manhood . This figure , as all of the office girls who 've been there any length of time know , is somewhat skewed , since pervert calls , like thefts and the deaths of old men , rise slightly around Thanksgiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their strange callers , like the Sunday-night woman who laughs maniacally into the receiver and the man who rings up every few months to say , " Hello , I 'm a citizen of the universe , and I 'm gon na open up a can of whoopass on you . You still at 20 Westport Center Drive ? Do n't leave . I 'm on my way , " are shoved into the pervert category even though their inflictions are of an entirely different nature . <p> The reservations girls at the Little Rock Marriott Renaissance Hotel also know that their own situation is not unique , that the nocturnal love songs of the phone perverts are offered up to women everywhere-women in the pink-collar professions with toll-free numbers and no Caller ID-from the Blue Cross Blue Shield customer service reps in Chicago , to the Rock-n-Roll Super Hits of the Seventies album order-takers in Omaha , to the PBS donation operators in Des Moines . These Little Rock reservations girls , at least the ones who 've been at it for more than a month or two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intimate quirks of these anonymous men . They know that the phone perverts are always polite-not the kind of polite that keeps them from saying things like " I 'm over at the Hampton Inn , and my mother 's here , and I 'm fucking her in the ass , " but the kind of polite that admits defeat , that forces them to hang up the phone graciously when one of the girls gives them the obligatory " Get a life , sicko " and " Do n't call back . " The cleverest of these girls have come to appreciate the art of phone perversion : the suspense involved , the holding and delivering of dirty one-liners , the structured conversations as finely crafted as a sales pitch , or a good joke . <p> According to the Orientation Manual for New Reservations Agents , these phone perverts should be handled in a certain way , and when their shift supervisor , the tall one named Vince who bites his nails and has yellow nicotine rings around his nostrils , is standing over the reservations girls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , sir , but I 'll have to terminate this call , " they say . " I 'd be happy to make a reservation for you if you called back and spoke to me in a less abusive manner . Have a nice day . " But when Vince or the general manager or the nosy housekeeping supervisor is n't in the office , the girls who 've been around for a while prefer to deal with the pervert calls in their own fashion . Chrissie , a nursing student who always has her anatomy flashcards spread out next to her station and hands out cupcakes with little notes on Snoopy paper for Valentine 's Day , usually squeals and tosses the phone down in its cradle , saying , " Oh , that nasty man , " and flushing with embarrassment , or with something else like it . Leslie , who was sent back to reservations from the front desk for accepting too many gifts from the Norfolk Southern railroad men , likes to tease the phone perverts . On her days off , she wears dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor to zip them , and everyone knows this is why her two sons have funnyshaped heads ; the baby one , Hunter , has a big dent like someone deflated him just above the left eye , and the three-year-old named Troy has a big bulge on top and a tiny chin , an ill-formed peanut head . Leslie taunts the perverts by making them repeat themselves- " I 'm sorry , sir , but what did you say ? Come again , I did n't quite catch that " - until the men are so frustrated they hang up , their dirty words made useless by Leslie 's hard-of-hearing routine . The others-Claudia , the natural redhead , and Lily , who comes from Mississippi-usually swear at the phone perverts , letting loose the pent-up hatred that comes from forty hours a week of haggling with secretaries and travel agents over the price of a hotel room . <p> Of all the girls who 've worked the late shift at the Marriott reservations desk for any amount of time , only Judy , who is gone now , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so gone that she 's disappeared from the lore of the place , ever had the least bit of empathy for these late-night compulsive cold-callers of strange women , and so when there was a phone pervert on Judy 's line , swearing or panting into the receiver , she would let him off easy and quietly hang up . <p> None of the girls on the four-to-midnight shift at the Marriott reservations desk knew much about Judy . They knew she was widowed , or divorced , or maybe just thrown over by a live-in lover , some small-town someone who stole off in the night with her credit card and her grandmother 's silver candlesticks . They knew she came to Little Rock and the reservations desk back when Ted Saunders was still the general manager , during the summer when the hotel 's air conditioners went out for three days while they were hosting a convention for special children who did n't have sweat glands , and that she spent her first days of training handing out bottled water and icing down the sobbing things after they passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hallways . They knew that when Judy came to Little Rock she rented a one-bedroom apartment on Forest Avenue near the park , and that she spent every morning before work for two weeks scouring the stores for bargain housewares , filling the apartment with brightly colored things until it looked like a kindergarten classroom . " An affinity for bright colors suggests a healthy person with a happy childhood , " she had said when some of the girls came to her apartment to pick her up for an all-employee meeting . The girls were n't convinced , since they knew that after those first two weeks when Judy filled her apartment with yellow curtains and blue towels , things around Judy 's place began to stagnate , with nothing much more than the single occupant and some junk mail and a few bags of groceries each week moving in and out , and with the orange rugs and green sofa growing dingy and fading into pastels . <p> Judy was twenty years older than the rest of the girls , and for that reason alone , since she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoted , they let her boss them around a little . She was n't all that bossy-she kept to herself most of the time , holed up at her station with the latest issue of Woman 's Day or Cosmo-but she did have her moments , like when Leslie would tease the phone perverts and Judy would march up to her workspace and say , " Jesus , Leslie , just hang up the phone and be nice . Do n't you know everyone 's got their problems ? " while she eyed the five-by-seven picture of baby Hunter on Leslie 's desk , the one where baby Hunter is dressed like a pumpkin with a big rotten spot just below the stem . Leslie usually smirked at this , but she obeyed , at least for a week or two , since everyone knew a little about the thing between Judy and the pantyhose man . <p> The pantyhose man was Judy 's favorite phone pervert , the only one of these men who ever got more from her than just the usual silent slipping of the phone into its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pervert-in-denial , " the gentlemanly sort of obscene caller who refrains from using the standard coarse language , and who draws pleasure from trying to keep the semblance of a normal conversation with the woman on the end of the line . He was the most reliable of the phone perverts , because he called every week-always on a Wednesday evening between eight and ten , since the first November Judy worked at the reservations desk . Each time he called , the pantyhose man kept to the same routine , claiming he was a representative from No Nonsense , or L'eggs , or Victoria 's Secret , or whatever brand of women 's hosiery was currently hot and heavily marketed , and asking one of the reservations girls for a moment of her time to complete a brief questionnaire . The first time Judy had him on the line , before she knew what he was all about , she answered his questions with clumsy honesty . <p> " Do you wear pantyhose to work , ma'am ? " he asked , and she could hear him shuffling papers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's part of the dress code . " <p> " And do you enjoy wearing pantyhose ? " <p> " Not really , " she said . " They make your feet stink . " <p> " Okay , then , " he said . " Moving on . Is there a particular brand you prefer ? " <p> " I usually just buy the generic kind from Walgreens or wherever . I do n't know what they call them . " <p> " And what is your hosiery size , if I may ? " he said . There was a moment 's hesitation , and then he explained . " You see , ma'am , we 're sending out free samples of our new extra-strength , run-free nylons , and I 'd like to help you select the product that 's right for you . " <p> " Oh . Queen One , mostly , but it depends on the brand . " With this the pantyhose man sighed , thanked her , and politely hung up . <p> At first Judy thought nothing of this call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telemarketers and survey-takers who occasionally called the reservations desk , and who were usually a welcome diversion on a slow and boring shift . But then the pantyhose man called back , first to Claudia 's line , then to Lily 's , and after a month or so of Wednesdays , the girls caught on to the pantyhose man 's scheme . It was Leslie with her taunting who figured out the script , the right set of answers to complete the pantyhose man 's survey and get to the grand prize : <p> PANTYHOSE MAN : Do you enjoy wearing pantyhose ? <p> OPERATOR : Yes , they feel nice next to my skin . <p> PANTYHOSE MAN : What size do you wear ? <p> OPERATOR : Extra-tall . <p> PANTYHOSE MAN : What color ? <p> OPERATOR : White . <p> PANTYHOSE MAN : Do you wear them with underwear or without ? <p> OPERATOR : Without . <p> PANTYHOSE MAN : Would you like a free sample of our product ? <p> OPERATOR : Sure , what do I have to do ? <p> PANTYHOSE MAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've worn-to the address I 'm about to give you . <p> When the girls heard this , Chrissie squealed , and Claudia swore , and Judy said , " Maybe he did n't mean it like that , " and they all had a good chuckle over the pantyhose man . Still , even though the girls had written him off as just another in the string of pervert callers that came with the territory of the reservations desk , there was something about the pantyhose man-something about that voice , which was both a little sexy and a little sad , or maybe something about that sigh he gave Judy . It was a sigh that said this thing he had to do , this endless waiting for everything to turn out the right way , for the woman on the other end to say the right words , was making him tired-maybe this was the something that intrigued judy , that kept her from hanging up like usual on the pantyhose man . <p> And so Judy was prepared the next time she got his call , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little , adding , " I wear extra-tall , and it 's so hard to find stockings that fit right because my legs are so long . " She scratched down the address he gave her , a PO box in South Bend , Indiana , and she shoved it inside the pocket of her purse . She carried the address with her for two weeks , trying to decide what to do with it . She tried to imagine the pantyhose man : what he looked like , where he worked , what he wore . Sometimes she pictured him short and dark-haired , a tax accountant dressed in elastic-waist pants and a nubby golf sweater , and sometimes as a lanky strawberry-blonde in a one-piece Dickies jumpsuit like an auto mechanic . Sometimes he had a scar snaking from the corner of his upper lip , leftover from a dog bite when he was six , and other times he had a handlebar mustache or webbed toes or a broken arm . The physical variations were endless , but the setting in which Judy imagined him was always the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the park , with faded wall-to-wall carpeting worn threadbare by his lonely late-night pacing with the cordless phone in hand and the wrench of anticipation tightening with the pulse of each digit he dialed . <p> When Judy decided what to do about the pantyhose man , she went to the Piggly Wiggly and bought flour and eggs , and then she baked two dozen peanut-butter cookies with Hershey Kisses shoved into their middles . She put them into a cookie tin decorated with a replica painting of the 1940 's Tesoro Rancho orange-crate girl , a curly-haired gypsy type with huge , gold hoop earrings and plump legs wrapped in black stockings , and she wrote a note that said , From the tall blonde with the white thigh-highs . These cookies are not poisoned . Please enjoy , and then she sent the package to him with the Little Rock Marriott Renaissance Hotel as the return address . <p> And that 's when it began-the anonymous courtship , or friendship , or symbiotic acquaintanceship of Judy and the pantyhose man . It became a regular Wednesday-night thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretending he 'd never heard Judy 's voice before , and with Judy offering up an ever-changing account of her hosiery preferences-nude stockings with a red garter belt one week , lace fishnets the next , navy-blue ribbed knee-highs the week after . The gypsy-girl cookie tin , empty except for a few buttery crumbs , came back to the hotel in a box addressed to the evening reservations staff . There was no thank-you card , nothing but the same PO box on the return label to indicate where it was from , but Judy knew he was grateful , and he began asking for her by name-or not by name , exactly , since name-exchanging was not part of the silent agreement between Judy and the pantyhose man , but by requesting the older woman in reservations in a different put-on voice every week . <p> The girls on the late shift at the reservations desk were not fooled . They heard Judy through the walls of her cubicle in bits and snatches , distinguished words like control top and cotton crotch in the low murmur of Judy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started innocently enough , with the switchboard operator 's announcement that there was a man on the phone for Judy , and could someone see if she was in the bathroom because it sounded urgent , and then Chrissie found Judy in the supply closet fetching printer paper and everyone put their calls on hold and discreetly tipped their ears towards Judy 's workstation , thinking the man on the phone might be the AWOL lover , or a new admirer , or at least a new friend she had met at the laundromat or the drugstore . When they realized it was the pantyhose man Judy was carrying on with , there was much talk in the break room over french-inhaled Virginia Slims and Diet Cokes , but no one said a word about this to Judy , just like no one said a word to her when Lily caught her hunching under her desk with her shoe off , sniffing it after someone had mentioned an odor in the back office , or when Leslie and Claudia saw one of the banquet servers back into Judy 's Ford Escort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumper . <p> And so Judy continued on with the pantyhose man , unaware that their relationship was quickly becoming public knowledge . It was a relationship , like any other mutually agreeable pairing , that had its ups and downs . Judy began spending time in the public library looking for little gifts for the pantyhose man , tidbits from the Internet to spice up their usual exchange , things like : " Did you know that the ' ny ' in ' nylons ' comes from ' New York , ' because the first pair of nylons made their debut at the 1939 New York World 's Fair ? " or : " Did you know that some shots of the tornado in The Wizard of Oz were created by filming a nylon stocking blown by a fan ? " The pantyhose man seemed to enjoy these little tidbits , responding to them with a hearty chuckle that had surprised Judy at first , and made her think that maybe , in some way , she had the power to make this strange man happy . <p> There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in a foul mood because a little boy in the grocery store pointed and screamed at the varicose veins roping across the backs of her calves , and the Wednesday she spilled a Coke on her white uniform blouse in the car . And there was the Wednesday she came into work and found a note from the sales department on her desk asking her to cancel the forty-five rooms for the Future Farmers of America that she was supposed to get commission on , all because the convention was pulling out after the hotel refused to hire four extra security guards to keep two hundred teenagers from humping in the coatrooms . On these difficult Wednesdays , when the pantyhose man called with his usual " Ma'am , if I could have a moment of your time . . . , " Judy would hiss , " I do n't have any time for you right now , " and hang up the phone . But when things like this happened the pantyhose man would still call the next week , steady as ever , and Judy would feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little something extra for him-spiked heels , perhaps , or schoolgirl knee socks with tassels . <p> Things carried on like this for months , years even-a little over two years , anyway , as far as anyone could remember . It got so that the reservations girls grew tired of eavesdropping , began to ignore Judy 's steamy exchanges with the pantyhose man , grew accustomed to and ignored them like they grew accustomed to other things around the office : the low buzz of the defunct fire exit sign above the door , the crusty soup bowls stacked on a filing cabinet that the morning-shift girls forgot to take back to the kitchen , the habitual tardiness of a night auditor who came in twenty minutes late every shift and stole the loose change from the bottoms of the other girls ' purses . They ignored Judy herself , largely , and Judy seemed content with this lack of attention-she sat in her workspace most days , humming and nipping through magazines , polishing her nails , answering her line with a pleasant chirp and the mandatory department greeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , central Arkansas 's premier hotel and conference center , you 've reached the reservations department , how may I help you today ? " <p> And then things changed somehow , almost imperceptibly at first , so that only a couple of the girls noticed it at the beginning . Judy started becoming louder-louder in her step , which would drag across the floor and pucker the cheap padding under the industrial-length carpet when she walked , and louder in her movements , louder in the wake of stale office air that whooshed behind her when she entered the room . This loudness , this slamming of phone and flicking of pen , lasted for weeks , longer than any temporary foul mood , any spilled Coke in the car or retracted reservation commission , could possibly explain , and then came the day when Judy breezed in ten minutes after her shift began , tossed the sunglasses from her face , and said ( in a gruff voice that suggested a lack of proper rest and loud enough for people on the other side of the door in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What a damn lovely day it is , damn it . " <p> It was then that Judy reentered the collective imagination of the reservations girls , and they began tipping their ears once again to the commotion in her cubicle . It took them two weeks to discover that something was missing , that the shuffling and sighing from Judy 's end of the room was filling a void left , they realized , by the disappearance of the pantyhose man . They kept on this hunch for a month , and in the end their theory played out , with not a single one of them picking up the familiar call , receiving the usual Wednesday-night request for the older woman in reservations . <p> By the time the girls figured this out , Judy 's loudness had subsided , and suddenly she was not growing more raucous , but smaller instead . There was nothing now but a low murmur , a simmer , from her cubicle , and then she was boiling down right in front of their eyes . At first it was the ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's lost a lover , or before she goes on a cruise-the ten pounds they commended her for , saying , " Looking good , Judy , " and getting nothing in response . And then it was the space she occupied that was growing smaller , the cubic mass of Judy and her various extensions : her splayed-out assortment of magazine articles and perfume samples sweeping into a neat stack , and the stack shifting into a desk drawer , and then Judy sitting more or less motionless in her chair , her arms pulled in tight to her sides and her hands in her lap-Judy growing smaller and smaller in the presence of the reservations girls until the day in mid-October when she simply disappeared , missed her Wednesday shift , and then her Thursday , and the girls never saw her again . <p> What happens now depends on what you think of the pantyhose man , of phone perverts , of obscene and harassing phone callers in general . Who are these men ( largely men , although of course there are women , here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are they empty-headed , drunken fraternity boys , out for a chuckle , or are they something more serious-sad and frustrated sexual misfits ? Are they somewhere far out there , out past the scope of your peripheral vision , or are they right in front of you : your neighbor , your butcher , the boy you befriended in junior high with the stringy hair and the model glue and the flabby breasts , the one whose lonely antics you eventually ignored in order to glide smoothly into your uncomplicated and healthy adult life ? Are they your Sunday school teacher , the Santa Claus stand-in at the mall ? Are they your father ? And how would you know ? And what would you do if you found out ? <p> Judy is gone now from the Little Rock Marriott Renaissance Hotel . The girls at the reservations desk did what they could . After the first few missed shifts , they left her long concerned-sounding phone messages , which , after days without return , became short angry messages , with swearing involved , that complained of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was supposed to be at work ? They even looked for her a little , sending Chrissie out to her Parkside apartment , where she knocked repeatedly on the front door until one of the neighbors poked his head out and shot her a nasty glare . She rattled Judy 's doorknob and threw pebbles at her window , and then she tried to peer through the crack between the curtains and saw nothing but a sliver of the orderly corner table next to Judy 's sofa in the dim light that filtered in through the thin curtain fabric . She tried to jimmy open the locked mailbox with no success , then gave up and reported back to management , who sent out the officialsounding letter explaining Judy 's termination , along with her final paycheck , which the accounting staff reports she never cashed . <p> Still , even though Judy has disappeared from her workspace , has vanished from the payroll , has never been seen again by anyone who works at the Little Rock Marriott Renaissance , she still lingers , with the idea of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady flow of gossip and speculation that passes from employee to employee , from year to year . Like the other hotel employees who left or lost their jobs in a flurry of confusion or deception or violence-like the sales rep who talked the Arkansas Corvette Club into writing their $10,000 convention deposit check to her and stole off with the money just after she got into the computer system and erased every reservation made for the following three months out of spite for a lecherous reservations manager who kept trying to stick his hand up her skirt , like the fired sous chef who quietly peed in the pickle bucket on his way out the door , like the maintenance man named Bill , the one they called Little Romeo , who had a wife and an ex-wife and a girlfriend , each one twice as big as he was , each one unsuspecting and privately scheduled to come see him every day at a different time so she would n't get wind of the others , each one so enamored of Little Romeo that the other maintenance men might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pants down in a car with one of them , and then they might walk into an outof-order room two hours later to the sight of the white half-moons of Little Romeo 's rear end beneath his work shirt as he labored over another , and so on until the wife or the girlfriend or one of these women found something out and hacked Little Romeo to death with the claw end of his favorite hammer in the rollaway storage room on the second floor , making such a mess that the hotel had to order twenty-two new folding beds to replace the ruined ones-like these former employees who hover in the atmosphere of the Little Rock Marriott , the lore surrounding Judy and the pantyhose man remains with the place , to be summoned up on slow nights when there 's nothing much on the radio , or in moments of nostalgia when the reservations girls sit around the office like high school friends ten years gone , rehashing the details of their formerly shared and distant pasts , the phrase " Was n't that just crazy ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessed phone silence and delightful regurgitation , the girls in the reservations office sit around one desk with plates of beef stroganoff they sweet-talk from the head chef and go over their theories of what may have become of Judy . Everyone thinks the pantyhose man had something to do with it-even Vince , when he weighs in on the matter , and this makes the girls feel even more sure of themselves , because they know that Vince studied law enforcement for a semester at the community college , and that he spends most of his time at work hiding in the furnace room , chain-smoking and reading Agatha Christie novels , and so they figure he has a mind for such things . One by one the reservations girls tell him their takes on the matter , and he nods with approval at each theory . <p> Chrissie thinks that Judy and the pantyhose man decided to meet , and that Judy ran away to live with him in some far-flung and peaceful retreat like Alaska or Rhode Island . Claudia disagrees , swears that the pantyhose man just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , that Judy simply took off in search of a new place , like she did after Mr. Candlesticks and Credit Card broke her heart . Leslie , who turns everything this way , thinks that Judy went dirty on them and became a phone pervert herself , or at least a phone sex operator , and that she 's still around somewhere , maybe even in the same Parkside apartment with the curtains drawn , having her groceries home-delivered while she spends sixteen hours a day moaning into the phone . And then there is Lily , who is often quiet and unsettled , and she swears that she has dreams of Judy-dreams that some do n't take lightly ever since Lily found a guest 's lost diamond pinkie ring by telling the housekeepers she dreamed it was in the sixth-floor laundry room , in the lint trap , fourth dryer from the right-and in these dreams she sees Judy at the edge of a river , silent and unmoving while the river tide laps at her feet , her face purple and bloated in the moonlight by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
