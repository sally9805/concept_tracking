<p> NASHVILLE  --  For decades , Belmont University 's only hope to have a presence in the NCAA basketball tournament rested on one of its country music alumni being invited to sing the national anthem . <p> But Belmont 's men 's basketball team has fulfilled the wish made in a song by one of its Grammy-winning former students in Lee Ann Womack 's hit I Hope You Dance . <p> College basketball 's big dance will include Belmont for the first time , and it also will be the school 's first appearance in any NCAA tournament . <p> " It 's worth at least a million dollars to us , " Belmont President Robert C. Fisher says of the exposure his school has received since gaining an NCAA tournament bid with an overtime victory March4 in the Atlantic Sun Conference tournament final . <p> With several hundred students watching Sunday 's televised bracket selections with the team , a roar went up when Belmont 's 15th-seeded Bruins were matched against UCLA 's second-seeded Bruins in San Diego . <p> " These Bruins are the ones who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pep rally MC David Fish , a Class of 2004 Belmont grad who started the MOB  --  Motivational Organization of Belmont  --  after a 2001 game drew only three students . <p> The NCAA tournament appearance helps validate the bold and expensive step the 4,300-student private institution took in 1996 , when it jumped from the low-profile NAIA to the NCAA 's top-level Division I. The University at Albany ( N.Y. ) also saw a move up pay off this weekend , when it won the America East Conference for its first Division I tournament bid . But UAlbany , which also began in the NAIA , reached the top level gradually , playing in the NCAA 's Divisions III and II before switching to Division I in 1999 . <p> Belmont 's leap , which pushed its annual athletic budget from $1.8million to $6million , was made by its former president , William Troutt , now president of Rhodes College in Memphis . Troutt was tired of seeing his school 's renown limited largely to Music Row , the Nashville boulevard that is the hub of country music recording . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music-related majors , Belmont has sent songwriters , studio technicians and such country stars as Trisha Yearwood and Brad Paisley on the short walk from campus to Music Row . But , Troutt says , " Beyond the Nashville area , people did n't know who we were . They needed some kind of validation about an institution they did n't know anything about . " <p> That 's only beginning to change . Belmont 's MVP in the Atlantic Sun tournament , sophomore guard Justin Hare , grew up in southeast Tennessee but says he did n't know anything about Belmont when he was recruited . Now , Hare says , " Nobody will be asking where Belmont is anymore . " <p> And 6-11 junior center Boomer Herndon , who transferred from Tennessee , says when he was growing up in Nashville , " I thought I was a little too big for Belmont . ... I fit just right now , I guess . " <p> Troutt saw athletics as the answer to Belmont 's anonymity but says he would n't have made the move to the NCAA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Coach Byrd was the key , " Troutt says . " I had enormous faith in him . " <p> Byrd is in his 20th season at Belmont , and among the honors his 483-273 career record has earned is a place in the NAIA Hall of Fame . <p> He also is probably the only college coach who can address his " under-the-table " past with pride . His fascination with college basketball began as a toddler when his sportswriter father , Ben , covered the University of Tennessee basketball team for the Knoxville Journal and Byrd watched games from under the tables on press row . <p> Byrd watched Adolph Rupp 's legendary Kentucky teams , then went on to be a Tennessee junior varsity player who practiced against future NBA players Bernard King and Ernie Grunfeld . He was a Tennessee assistant for Ray Mears . Among his rewards when he got the Belmont head coaching job in 1986 was getting to drive his low-budget team 's van 5,000 miles a year . <p> His teams averaged 31 NAIA wins for four seasons from 1992 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the records would suffer . " It was a chance for me to be a Division I coach without having to leave my school , " he says . " I knew we were going to lose a lot those first few years , so maybe they did n't hurt as bad . " <p> Belmont struggled with a 9-18 mark in 1997-98 and had a 7-21 season in 1999-2000 . But by 2003-04 it went 21-9 and earned a trip to the NIT . That also was the season Belmont made its first national headlines , upsetting No.23-ranked Missouri . " That gave us a sense of , ' We can do it , ' " says Byrd , whose Bruins are 20-10 this season . " Anytime a school like us wins a game like that , you 're the team of the day . " <p> If Belmont 's story inspires any NAIA schools to attempt the same jump , they might want to talk to Mike Strickland first . Belmont 's athletics director left Murray State in Kentucky to oversee Belmont 's ascent and arrived at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an NCAA-caliber gymnasium . <p> " Belmont kind of jumped off the cliff , " Strickland says . " It was faith . We did n't have a league , and we did n't have but seven basketball players that first year . " <p> With no league and no prospect of reaching the NCAA tournament as an independent , Strickland says , " What Division I player would want to play here ? " <p> Fisher soon carved out his reputation as " Bob the Builder " by raising $52million for The Curb Event Center that includes a 5,000-seat basketball arena . <p> But before the arena was completed in 2003 , Belmont spent two nomadic seasons playing games at Aquinas College , Nashville 's Municipal Auditorium and a handful of dates at the Gaylord Entertainment Center . Strickland says of that hectic period : " I used to tell people that someday we 'll make the NCAA tournament , and then you 'll understand why we 're doing this . " <p> Until plans for the new arena were in place , Strickland says , no league took Belmont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 , but Strickland says he was kept waiting two hours for his first meeting , then received only a 10-minute audience . <p> Other challenges included adding women 's golf , soccer and track to meet the NCAA minimum requirement of 16 teams , plus increasing athletic scholarships from 40 to 110 . And with all teams playing a Division I schedule , travel budgets soared . <p> " You have no idea of what getting into a league is going to cost until you get into it , " Strickland says . <p> The competitive aspect was equally bracing . " It did n't matter how hard we worked , we were just outmatched , " Strickland says . <p> Fisher co-authored a book in the 1990s , Real Dream Teams . It examined winning characteristics of groups ranging from the USA 's " Miracle on Ice " Olympic hockey team of 1980 to the first team of Americans to scale Mount Everest . <p> Fisher keeps one sports trophy in his office , won four consecutive years by his personal collection of dream teams . The Atlantic Sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletes who have a grade-point average of 3.0 or better . Of Belmont 's 220 athletes , about 70% meet that standard . <p> " I graciously tell the other college presidents that the only reason we 've only won it for four years is because we 've only been in the conference four years , " Fisher says . <p> Coach Byrd echoes that philosophy , saying his proudest accomplishment this season is seeing Belmont lead the league in basketball all-academic selections with 12 . <p> For leading scorer Hare , 12 also is the number of foster kids his parents typically had living at their Cleveland , Tenn. , home . " I learned a lot living in that environment , " Hare says , adding his household chaos has made it easier to handle pressure on the court , where he 's averaging 15.9 points . <p> Center Herndon also has weathered " UT reject " taunts from opposing fans because of his transfer from Tennessee . " If they 're chanting at me the whole game , then they 're worried about me , " Herndon says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knows Belmont 's first NCAA tournament game also could be the last of his college career , he still expects to be back on court at The Curb Center someday . <p> " Being the first team ever , nobody can take that away from us , " Collins says . " We 're going to come back 25 years from now , and they 'll introduce us at halftime . "
