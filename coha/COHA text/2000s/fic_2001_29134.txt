Howard Johnson 's House At a time when environment simply meant surroundings , Howard Johnson , the hotelier , used dynamite to gouge a foothold for his mansion overlooking Paradise Valley . He built a carport to accommodate six automobiles , including his favorite , a white Lincoln Continental , its windows dark and mirrored . He enclosed the cement balcony with wedding cake railings that occasionally saved inebriated guests from toppling into the pale , hardscrabble desert below . When he sold the house , the neighbors lower on Phoenix Mountain were optimistic . At last , they said , someone will get rid of the orange roof . * * * The mansion is now calm and almost dark behind its swimming pool moat . The beam from a security light is fractured in the ripples of the spa . Here is the peace of wealth . Cecil sits on the raw silk comforter of the king-size bed , shaking his knotted gold cuff links like dice , an unconscious wish for better luck . Beth says , " But what 's she dying of ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillows : brocade , tapestry , needlepoint -- her decorator 's studied mismatch . Cecil says , " She wo n't tell me . " Beth 's black-framed reading glasses are new since their wedding two years ago . Her elbow rests on a velvet pillow menacingly embroidered NOT TONIGHT . Cecil walks into his closet . A stack of unread JAMAs leans against the black plaid golf bag . He crumples his shirt into the pile . " You can phone Dick in the morning , " Beth calls . " She has a new doctor . She said it was time to be independent . She wants to take charge . " His mother had made it sound like getting hired for a first job . That 's what amazed him more than anything : she seemed less frightened than proud , invigorated . He pictures Edna 's face as she told him , her smile crisp as hotel linen . " Dear , " she 'd said , " I 'm very ill . It 's t-e-r-m-i-n-a-l . " And he 'd thought , actually prayed , Please , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise to this and do the right thing . But he also thought -- and he was ashamed to admit it -- why did she have to spell it ? Beth enters his closet , straightens a tie on the rotating rack -- a tie that reveals Cecil 's first wife 's strange taste . It has squiggles like anxious sperm . Beth says , " What are you going to do ? " What he must do -- urgently , must do -- is be the best son he can be . He must find a way not to be irritated by his mother . This is a test , from God or Edna , a test he will pass . " What do you think I should do ? " he says . " I think you should find out : ( a ) what she 's dying of and ( b ) what she wants you to do for her . " Beth often alphabetizes answers . But it makes sense , and it sounds simple . His spirits lift until he thinks of Edna , standing in the foyer of Symphony Hall after spelling out her doom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braid on the lapels and with pearl buttons . Apricot and lime green , she 's explained , are secret code colors of wealth and good taste . Sipping Dr. Pepper : " It 's a fine production , " she said of a tired and sound-distorted Grease . " Do n't you think Zuko is authentic ? " She put her hand , suddenly , on his arm . " I had to change doctors . Dick misses things . " Cecil sensed her energy then , focused and precise , even as she was talking about her death . " What has Dick missed ? " " Phh , " she said , an exhale ruffling her lips , indicating Dick 's omissions were too numerous and odious to mention . " I do n't want you and Ted to worry about me . " By which he knew that 's precisely what she wanted -- as well as attention ; she was dying for it . " Homosexuals , " she said , way too loudly , " is n't it interesting how they like theater ? Why do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions that deserve no answer . Also , affectations of broad-mindedness . Now Beth dumps the pillows off the bed like unwelcome pets . A little yoga and a lot of money seem to have made her serene . She says , " She 's probably just trying to be brave . " Edna brave ? Not likely . Cecil thinks of her terror at his father 's funeral , the gulping sobs like drowning and then a last-minute refusal to let the casket be lowered . " I just ca n't do that to him , " she 'd said , the heels of her small black pumps sinking into the soggy earth and the vein in her temple throbbing . And Ted with his always too-long hair said , unhelpfully , " Mom , you do n't have to , " which was after all -- Cecil remembers -- the tack that finally worked . He struggles to consider her as simply another human being . Distance , he feels , would help him do better . But just as he ca n't imagine Edna 's pride and joy , the silver and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only his and Ted 's . Her past choices so old they seem to never have been decisions at all , just circumstances that have always existed . She has always said taupe when brown would have done , and burgundy instead of red . She has always salted lettuce and sipped Dr. Pepper . But death . That 's making Edna something else . Because she is dying , suddenly she has life . Still exasperating , still impossible , but exposing him , making him accountable . Beth touches his face . Her cool fingers slide to his jaw . She says , " I 'm taking a bath . " He walks to the window and looks past the city lights to the dark , prehistoric hulk of Camelback Mountain . There is a light where the camel 's ears might be . Campfire , hikers . The Search and Rescue team bills them when they have to risk their own lives getting them down . My mother is dying , he thinks , and he 's chagrined to realize all he feels is extremely tired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced . " It 's a roof , Cecil , " she 's said . " And it 's orange . " But when he bought the house he was recently divorced and undone by failure as well as hope . He 'd walked through the empty rooms and thought of the man who built them . He read about Johnson , how critics announced that he was not like his father , the restaurant 's founder . They called the younger Johnson an accountant , but said his father was clever , an entrepreneur with vision . The business began to fail when the son stuck with the stodgy menu ; everyone -- Denny 's , Marriott , Big Boy -- diversified . Restaurants specialized . They became ethnic , regional , or themed . They offered a variety of single menu items . How could Howard Johnson 's compete with Baskin-Robbins ' reckless imagination ? But Cecil was vicariously proud of his Johnson 's accomplishments . The restaurants had a plain , homey comfort . Nice , clean restrooms . The orange roofs signaled that : something happy and decent . He fancies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeans with cuffs rolled wide -- the kind he 'd wanted to wear , but Edna called too ugly . Cecil finds he 's fond of Howard Johnson . He feels he understands him , often calls him Howard . He is unsettled , however , when he tries to remember eating at a Howard Johnson 's , because he ca n't recall a single time . * * * Pajamas soaked from urine or sweat -- he 's too scared to know which -- five years old and he tells Edna his nightmare . " Dreams come true in the opposite , " she said . " So it just means that someday you will swim fast and eat up a big shark . " Then she smiled as if something had been settled and left him sitting in the dark . * * * It 's from a dog bite . The nose has been degloved ; the cartilage destroyed . The patient , only nine , has blond too-thick hair . Her mother is agitated , anxious to declare her confidence in Cecil and to lament the tragedy that has befallen her only child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , looking at her daughter with conviction -- truckfuls of dizzying mother 's hope . His examining room is too ordinary for the excesses of this drama . The nubby carpet and high-backed vinyl chairs , the barren cleanliness seem designed to discourage or deny suffering . Cecil takes paper from the wall desk . He nudges the rolling stool back toward the girl and begins to sketch the reconstruction . " It 'll take at least two surgeries , " he says . When he glances at the girl , she 's looking at him carefully , as if she 's going to draw him . Cecil tells about taking cartilage from a rib , rotating a flap of skin from the forehead to cover it . The mother says they understand . The surgery is scheduled . The yellow insurance sheet torn off , hands shaken , pre-op is left to be discussed with the nurse . Halfway out the door Cecil turns back : " If you happen to have a photograph . Or can get me one . It can help . " Eagerly , the mother opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Verdant foliage seems to choke the other surroundings . To Cecil so much green looks desperate , false as hair dyed black . His patient is squatting and appears to have been examining something just out of the camera 's view . Now she looks up through sun-bleached bangs , not with irritation , but with the lingering pleasure of her discovery and also expectantly , as if what life offers is dependably good . Her face is shadowed by the suffocating green , but her nose is in the clearest light . It may be the ugliest child 's nose Cecil has ever seen . In French cuisine , it would be scrambled eggs doused with ketchup . In classic automobiles , it would be a Gremlin disfigured with body putty . She has a nose like a golf club -- a one wood . Too thin , then too round , and full at the tip . * * * At the party , Cecil is showing the aerial photograph Howard Johnson bad someone take of the house . The bedroom roofs fan out like a fluted fruit bowl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " says Andrea , an anesthesiologist 's wife , whose too-small nose is Mark Myer 's work . Cecil 's giving a tour . He 's shown the saltwater fish aquarium , with its pulsing sea anemone and fluorescent pink starfish . Then the kitchen where the fireplace is large enough to roast a boar , according to a Southwest Home article . In the living room Cecil motions toward the view , the cactus-studded mountains with their sudden bizarre rock formations . He feels dating living here , where the landscape does n't want to be inhabited and seems to wait patiently for him -- for all of them -- to go . " Incredible , " someone sighs . The sandy-haired anesthesiologist says , " Do you suppose the McDonald brothers ' houses had golden arches ? " Cecil says , " Howard Johnson 's took off when Johnson senior added butterfat to his ice cream flavors : vanilla , chocolate , and strawberry . " Cecil knows this brings all conversation to a bored standstill , and Beth has asked him not to do it . But the story is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group away . " Thongs , I say , should be worn only on feet . " He turns and in doing so bumps into a young woman who he sees has been waiting to catch his attention . She has the grim look of an overachiever . Her handshake is determined . She tells him her name , a man 's name , which he instantly forgets . She explains that she 's in a plastic surgery residency at the Mayo Clinic . " What I 'd like to know , " she says , " what I ca n't resist this opportunity to ask you -- is what you consider the key to a successful rhinoplasty . " Her eagerness makes him feel as if he 's been asked the secret of life . Cecil considers giving her the conventional answers : that a nose needs to match its owner ; that the dorsum must have a gentle break . But maybe because it 's a party , or perhaps because she 's so young and overzealous , instead he laughs : " It 's so much fun . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Perplexed . He says , " It 's like being able to change ugly ducklings into swans . When you consider what you can do with just a tuck at the nostril or by resloping the bridge ! " He pauses to savor the pleasure of it , a thrill he 's certain only the best in his field know . But the young doctor frowns . " A fairy godfather thing ? " This is not what she 'd hoped for . " Yes ! " Cecil ignores her disappointment . " I can grant the wish for a perfect nose . " He 's grabbed by the lawyer who set up his corporation . She asks if he thinks her forehead is falling . Beth walks toward him , graceful and careful , like a headdressed showgirl . " You preaching noses ? " " I was asked . " She roils her eyes , but smiles . " Ted called . " " Did he leave a number ? " She pauses . Silver bracelets jingle as she waves to someone across the room . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " Ted being on the road might mean a new job , a lost job , a move , a marriage . Ted thrives on big change and long odds . He 's content in the way only dreamers are . Ted will put his arm around Cecil 's shoulders and call him Sport , an affectation Cecil means to find irritating but always enjoys instead . " Does he know anything about Mother ? Has she told him what the disease is ? " He thinks of Edna , whose footing , he decides , seems unsure . A consequence of his not knowing what she 's dying of is that she seems to have symptoms of everything . " Ted does n't know any more than you do . " Beth pulls off a spangled earring , repinches it onto her ear . She nods toward their company . " How soon do you suppose they 'll go home ? " * * * Edna says fine is for wine , art , and china , but not for the weather . She says smuck for schmuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't imagine who corrected her . * * * Horrified , the mother says , " It looks like a tongue growing out of her forehead . Is there anything you can do in the meantime ? " Cecil says , " We have to leave it like that until it establishes its own blood supply . Then we 'll amputate it by the bridge , and we can start to sculpt it . " He clicks on his penlight , scoots his stool toward his patient . He 's been looking at the mother , searching for clues as to where the girl 's original nose came from , but the mother 's nose is ordinary , with a slight rise at the bridge . The girl continues to watch him thoughtfully , even sympathetically , as if she knows his secrets . More likely , he thinks , she has her own . He examines the tissue with his light and is satisfied it is healthy . He wonders why the girl did n't complain about the other children 's taunts . Surely , all of her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving her mother or herself ? " Mrs. Martin , " he says , clicking off the light , " this is going to take some patience . And her nose wo n't be the same as it was before . " The mother sputters . Her voice husky with despair , she says , " You 're supposed to be the best . My husband says they call you The Nose . " The girl brightens . " That 's what they always call me. " * * * Beth enjoys nice things . Cecil thinks this with pride and a twinge of miserly alarm as he notices new mosaic vases flanking the stone fireplace . " Do you like them ? " she says , coming up behind him . " They were quite a find . " Since she moved in , she and her decorator have undertaken a room-by-room redo . Gone are the bright red leather sofas he 'd had made . " Howard Johnson had some like them , " he 'd said weakly in their defense . " Cowboy boots are n't quite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disdain Cecil was intimidated and knew she must be good . He 's also a little scared of Beth , his former travel agent , who one day included with his ticket to the Canary Islands a printed card saying she had changed her name from Marilyn to Beth . Getting to know her better , he 'd hoped for an explanation that has never come . He does n't know why people would change their names , or even what it means to want to . But he 's sure her ability to sluff off a name proves she 's capable in ways he ca n't imagine being . Her decisiveness and self-assurance are the traits he 'd say attracted him to her . Her answers . Sometimes he fears the only thing he knows for certain is how to correct a nose . " Reproductions ? " Cecil says , hopefully , of the vases . " Reproductions of what ? " " Something more expensive ? " Beth 's smile is elusive . " The colors blend so nicely with the view , do n't you think ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Cecil thinks it sounds a little ominous . Rattlesnakes , he imagines , scorpions . He watches Beth look into the desert . He 's close enough to see how the red cast of her hair makes her eyes a sharper blue , but he ca n't tell what she 's thinking . His first wife was a librarian . You know where you stand with a librarian , he thinks . " Should we go out for dinner ? " she says , arranging bare swirly branches in the vases . " How about takeout ? " He 's exhausted . Beth frowns . " Long day ? " He 's had a letter from his patient 's mother , a rant about good faith , an admonition that he will not " play God " with her child 's nose . She says she sees what he 's trying to do . " Beth , what would you do --  " he starts to ask about his patient , but he finds he knows her answer will be to send the girl to someone else . She will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl is too risky . It could have serious consequences . It 's true , of course . But suddenly he ca n't stand to hear it , ca n't stand to think what this says about Beth -- that a certain dispassionate objectivity would allow her to abandon the girl ; that her decisions can be based on mere expediency . He switches topics : " Mom 's obsessed with getting a will drafted . " Beth 's look says , So what 's the matter with that ? " Beth , she does n't have enough to bother with . " " But it will give her a sense of closure . It will make her feel as if she does . " His mother is doing it for attention , he thinks . He feels sullen but also ashamed of the stubborn stinginess that wo n't allow him to feign the concern she craves . Beth says , " It 's easy to make Edna feel important . " She is always solicitous toward his mother . " Edna , take this chair , " she says , ushering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in her new , fragile body , flashing Beth one of her not-long-for-this-world smiles of appreciation . His mother looks like she 's lost weight , he thinks , oddly wishing for one of his own before-surgery pictures for comparison . She 's paler , too , of that he 's sure . " You need to be patient with her , " Beth says . " I 'll get the takeout menus . " He goes to the fireplace and sees the new vases are made of shards of old china . On one fragment there is gold lettering that spells Tuesday ; another has a beige fleur-de-lis . One piece has the gray-green stripe of a Depression-era cafeteria mug . Why , it could be from a Howard Johnson 's , he thinks . Pleased , he puts his mother out of his mind . * * * Cecil and Edna sit in her living room . With its careful arrangement of long-waisted ballerina figurines on a distress-finished table , it is Edna 's idea of someone else 's idea of appealing . A room like Edna , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a cup of tea in her pink art deco china . With a dull panic , he notices red pinpoints on her hand , which he thinks he remembers are a sign of a blood disease . He 'd like to blurt , What is your illness ? But he sees that her determination to keep it secret is a perversity she treasures . " I hope Beth will enjoy this set , " Edna says , lifting a cup toward him . She has been sorting her belongings into teetering piles . Cecil realizes that if she were n't Edna he would see how sad this is ; he would feel pity . Oddly , he could do better then , be more patient and tolerant . But pitying his mother -- even if he could -- would open some immense family floodgate that they would all slip through , helpless as trout . Something fragile is maintained in his reserve . " I 've found some things of your father 's . One is a wallet you made for him at summer camp . He never used it , " she adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , handing it back , though he has no idea where it came from . When he was ten Edna taught him to polka , after first insisting he wash his face and hands and comb his hair . Now , as he remembers it , it is not just the living room furniture that whirls by , but his growing up , his life . The card games she taught them with complicated , contradictory rules . " Salamander , " she 'd yell suddenly , her bangs permed like poodle fluff , her cards flying like bats . ( " Turn your head , too , " she said , as they polkaed . " Next time we 'll roll up the rug . " ) She cut their hair in the bathtub , then powdered them with Lily of the Valley . Ted begged to be spared the powder . She replied , " Silliest of boys . " ( An animal 's name -- a billy goat ? a bear ?  - -  in the polka 's title helped make it seem more fun . ) Then the thread was taut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , dear , " she said to his first wife about a homemade skirt Andrea wore to the library even after she got her Neiman 's charge . The dance ending , Cecil rug-burned an elbow in a dizzy fall . " Stop that racket , " his father yelled from the basement . Cecil supposes that was when he discovered that accordions were embarrassing and also a little sad . " ... those cookies I used to make at Christmas . Do you remember the year you ate them all ? And Ted told on you ? " Her laugh represents a past she wants them to have shared . She says Ted 's coming next week . She says she killed a black widow in the bathroom . But her chatter only communicates one thing to him : her last-chance hope for his love . He wonders when he got old enough that the failure of this relationship became his failure and no longer hers . How old was he when she called him Cecil-Weasel ? And did n't he love her then ? He searches for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanity , where the irritations of who she is overwhelmed his dutiful affection . When did his soul become so destitute ? A son who does not love his mother . Maybe it happened when he started medical school and she began to call him doctor -- not because her addressing him as doctor was pretentious and slightly mortifying , but because suddenly he was important . She adored him . Did he reject her because he guessed her love was based more on his status as a future physician than on who he really was ? My son , the doctor . Or perhaps his failure came later , during his residency . Did he despise Edna because the glamorous speciality so delighted her ? My son , the plastic surgeon ! Did it happen when he understood that he did n't intend to dedicate his life to transforming the ropy patches of burn victims ? Did he fear he 'd inherited her dubious ideals ? Did Cecil hate Edna because her love was , after all , based precisely on who he really was ? Why was n't she the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he the right kind of son ? " Beth sent this over , " he says , remembering the fruit basket she had shoved into his hands . " Take credit for it , " she had said . " How thoughtful she is , " Edna says . She picks up an apple , rubs the skin to make it squeak . " An apple for your thoughts , " she says . His frustration is so strong he thinks it leaves a taste -- a taste dusty and sharp , the bad flavor of a shriveled walnut . " Penny , " he gasps . " Mom , it 's a penny for your thoughts . " He begs it . * * * As they leave the examining room , the mother says , " You 'll pay for this . " In the absurd objective thinking of such times , Cecil decides , melodramatic . Before she 's yanked out , the daughter shyly waves . He sits on his examining table , clicking his penlight off and on . He shines it on the wastebasket lid , flashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out loud , " what have I done ? " He does n't even know her , this other Nose . He thinks it 's the photograph that got him here , the hopeful way she looked up . She deserved something . He 's glad about her wave . He puts the light in his pocket , pats his hospital identification badge . He 'd like to think of himself as a man of principle . He has done , and will stand by doing , the right thing . But this feels quaint and ineffectual , a Boy Scout reciting his oath . If good is triumphing somewhere , he guesses it has more to do with luck than choice or God . The sad irony is that the nose turned out better than he had hoped -- the skin blending surprisingly well , the new shape transforming the girl 's appearance like a fable . The nose is a miracle . " It was the best I could do , " he says , rehearsing his testimony . " The nose was like a golf club , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in court . " It was obvious . " He eases himself off the table and shoves the stool back under the desk . * * * Edna wept when he left his first wife . She said , " I wish I knew where this might lead . " Cecil said , " I knew where it was leading , Mother . I knew it was something I just could n't fix . " * * * Beth 's voice is a shrill soprano that twists in Cecil 's chest . They are singing " Happy Birthday " to Edna on his balcony . Beth 's smile is cheerful as the expensive birthday cake with puffy frosting carrots fake as Bugs Bunny 's . " Should I blow them out ? " Edna says before she does . She wears a pendant with an abstract shape like an internal organ . Liver , he thinks . No , pituitary gland . She pats it whenever something excites her . Cecil admits it : today his mother appears ill . She no longer fusses as before with the gauze pad taped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lost its novelty . She has a peaked look of fear . She says Ted 's arrival has been postponed for just a week or two , studiously overlooking how Ted has been unavoidably delayed four times already . Cecil watches as she turns toward the desert . He thinks the mountains seem close today , particularly inhospitable in the noon light . The olive green of the saguaros reminds him of a tank 's armor , and there 's a glare that makes him feel thirsty . Edna nods toward the Praying Monk , a huge sandstone formation on Camelback Mountain . Its devout posture is marred today by rock climbers on belay . " What are they doing up there ? " " Climbing , " Cecil says . " Why would they do that ? " She laughs , but is , in fact , expecting some answer . " I 'm being sued for negligence , " Cecil says . Beth looks up from her cake . " Negligence ? " " Gross negligence is the exact terminology . I expect to lose . " Beth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in ways they 'd never imagined . Beth 's voice is gentle . " Surely there 's something you can do ? " " I can operate again , give the child an ugly nose , but I 'm not going to . " Beth says , " Let 's think about this . " Edna whispers , " But what about me ? " " Edna ! " Beth flashes her a look of displeasure so sharp that Cecil flinches . He sees a pretense slip , Beth 's animosity for Edna exposed . He understands suddenly how he 's depended on Beth , counted on her doing the right thing with his mother . She has been his conscience , but this conscience , he sees , is based on what is easy , not on what is honest or even right . A conscience without feeling . Beth smooths the hair at her temples , a gesture he knows is calculated to restore her composure . But watching it , he imagines her adjusting a mask , adroitly blending the edges into her hair . Cecil looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his expensive all-terrain vehicle that has never been off asphalt . Like Beth , whose real name is Marilyn . He looks at his mother . Her face is pale . Her mouth quivers . He is all she has . " What is your illness , Mother ? " he says . Her hand flutters to her necklace . " Leukemia , " she says , a surrender reverent as a prayer . A breeze ruffles the fringe of the table 's umbrella and tosses Edna 's crumpled napkin . He waits to feel love for his mother . Now that he knows what she 's dying of . Now that he knows it is real . He thinks it could come like a spirit , floating from some heavenly height . A form with iridescence , like the rainbow shiver of oil on water . Maybe the Holy Spirit . But there is nothing . " Oh , God , " he says . He thinks of the rattlesnakes on the mountain , their bodies fat as a man 's arm . They suddenly seem real and close . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , this final , necessary cruelty . " He 'll leave this to me . I 'm sorry . " Beth says , " Cecil , stop . " He expects Edna to weep , but she does not . She holds her head in a way that seems brave . In her courage -- or the sad , limp imitation of it -- he sees she deserves some kind of love , and he wishes love were about what is deserved or earned . He wishes love could be awarded . * * * Three months later Cecil is in a booth meant for a family , where their sliding in would look comical , ending with the mother getting the last seat by a high-chaired baby . But Cecil is here alone . The menu is in a greasy plastic cover . The waitress looks so much like a waitress that Cecil believes serving tables was her only possible choice . She is a clich of swollen ankles and bobby-pinned hair . She calls him hon , an unconsidered intimacy from overwork and another era , but it touches him . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken cacciatore with " savory herb blends from Italy " and spiced baked ham with pineapple rings . No little red heart-smart labels in sight . An industry analyst in Hotel Management said that Howard Johnson could have saved the business if he 'd eaten at his own restaurants instead of lunching at 21 . " Spaghetti , " Cecil says , pointing , as if the menu is in a language he does n't trust himself to pronounce . She nods with grave approval . " Coffee with that , hon ? " The place is almost empty , just off I-10 where drivers can spot the orange roof . Cecil says , " Howard Johnson started out with three ice cream flavors in a store by a commuter rail station .

Losing a mother . That 's hard . " After she 's left he looks out the window . Near the entrance , orange lantana sprouts hopefully from the hard-packed bare ground . A couple of bedraggled palms shade the door . A car angles into the handicapped parking space . The waitress , whose name tag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , hon , " she announces proudly , but also sympathetically . " No , no . " He is undeserving . " I could n't possibly .
