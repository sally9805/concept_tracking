<p> It 's an inspired concept : make a movie out of a book . Pass over the original screenplay , which , more than likely , was written by a film school sharpie and is based on a television show , and seek out a novel , a textured story full of layered characters , digressions and odd subplots . <p> Lately , Hollywood has been doing just that . More than a dozen winter releases are drawn from novels or memoirs , including Patricia Highsmith 's The Talented Mr. Ripley , Stephen King 's The Green Mile , E. B. White 's Stuart Little , John Irving 's The Cider House Rules , Frank McCourt 's memoir Angela 's Ashes , Graham Greene 's The End of the Affair , and " Ride With the Devil , " renamed from Daniel Woodrell 's Woe To Live On , among others . Many of them are favorites for Oscar nominations , to be announced Tuesday . <p> This is all good and bad news for readers . Good because they can relive the narrative through another 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news because that new interpretation may recklessly tamper with and even destroy words and images that a reader had preciously conjured . Saul Bellow once said that he had the best of all worlds because all of his books had been bought by the movies but none had been made . ( A short film was made from More Die of Heartbreak , Bellow 's 1987 novel . It was not shown in theaters , but only as a " Great Performances " episode on PBS  --  on a warm Sunday afternoon when everybody was outside . ) <p> But nowadays we are visual monkeys , and seeing a book adapted into a film is as natural , albeit not as painless , as witnessing an actor become president . I saw my first novel , The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars and Motor Kings , turned into a film by the same name , and I had a great time with it . I held few illlusions about how faithful the movie would be to my work , though I had no problems with Richard Pryor taking a character and running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at all enamored of Hollywood , told me that the moment I took movie money my pact with the devil was sealed , and I had no right to demand or expect fidelity to my work . I could hope and plead and pray , but movie makers will do , she added , what movie makers will do . <p> I 'll go her one further and suggest that there are several books  --  particularly a few more of my own  --  that those Hollywood devils have overlooked . They are some of my favorites , novels , memoirs , and even a biography that are rich in character , wit , drama , and , as you 'll see , make-up . All are aching to be filmed . <p> Mercy . Not many people know that Mayor Richard M. Daley is a reader of mysteries , and I personally know that one of his favorites was this kinky thriller by David Lindsey . Lindsey is a terrific author who has not gotten his popular due . Mercy is a moist , nasty , scary thriller about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the point of view of a hopeless voyeur , even if the movie were lousy it 'd be good . <p> City Primeval . There are popular authors whose works have been filmed , but not always the right ones . One of them is Elmore Leonard , and no writer has more fans among other writers than Dutch . He deserved every bit of the acclaim and the loot he got for the movie of Get Shorty . But City Primeval : High Noon in Detroit , which Leonard wrote in 1980 , is a certifiable gem . Scene after scene in gritty , 1980s Detroit rings absolutely true . It is a shame that nobody has put the venal chops of Clement Mansell , Leonard 's urban hillbilly , on screen . " I do n't believe it . . . what did you kill me for ? " says Mansell , with five slugs in him , at the very end . <p> Briarpatch . Close behind Leonard on a writers ' favorites list is the late Ross Thomas . While a few of Thomas ' novels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crafty 1984 tale . It 's the consummate story of the outsider going back to his hometown to solve a crime  --  this one the murder of his police detective sister .

I have favorite authors whose stuff has been filmed , but badly . No good movie that I know of has been made of a Travis McGee mystery , the Florida Keys-based series of the late John D. MacDonald . Do The Long Lavender Look and I 'll be in the first row . And no skilled actor has made the character of McGee his own . McGee and his fans deserve the kind of portrayal Humphrey Bogart gave to Dashiell Hammett 's Sam Spade . ) <p> Boss . Sometimes character alone is enough to propel a film , especially when they are vintage Chicago characters . Mike Royko 's classic biography of Richard J.

I 'd watch it for the scene of Daley and his cronies discussing strategy before Martin Luther King Jr . ' s 1966 visit to Chicago . <p> Veeck as in Wreck . Who would n't want to see Bill Murray portray the old White Sox owner Bill Veeck , fuzzy head , peg leg and all , in any number of scenes from one of the best memoirs ever ? Minnie Minoso and Oscar Gamble could cameo . I could help with a scene on the Lee Phillip Show when ol ' Will 's squealing hearing aid drove the sound guys nuts or the time he amazed my toddling son by passing a fork through his prosthetic leg . Plans have been made to film Veeck 's life , but none have been consummated . <p> The Robbin ' Hoods . Many promised but no one ever made a movie out of this saga of the Panczko brothers , Chicago 's legendary thieves . Written by Chicago journalists John O'Brien and Ed Baumann , it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the oldest of the pilfering siblings , once stole a vat of peanut butter from a school only to have his mother send him back in to steal some bread . Out of the jug for a few years now , Pops is ready to consult . <p> The Blood of the Lamb . Everyone 's life should be molded by a novel or two or 10 . Books such as The Great Gatsby , A Farewell to Arms and To Kill a Mockingbird did just that for generations of readers . The Blood of the Lamb , by the late Peter De Vries , did it for me . De Vries , a fellow Dutchman and attendee of Calvin College in Grand Rapids , Mich. , so rocked my religious pins with this novel that I never recovered . Reading the account of the death of the narrator 's young daughter was more painful than ever . <p> Moonshine Light , Moonshine Bright . William Price Fox 's novel of boyhood in South Carolina is a tour de force of dialect and voice that fairly drips with sauce and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of itself and its South Carolina folks  --  Wilson Wade Hampton Peeler , the barbecue king  --  that no reader can fail to sail through it . Keep it from sinking into the simple-mindedness of " The Dukes of Hazzard " and movie audiences would never want to leave . <p> A Woman Run Mad . Despite my best efforts , it seems not many people have read the intense , erotic , chilling novel by John L'Heureux , and nobody has put it on screen . A deliriously content husband goes to buy his wife a handbag only to see the one he wants shoplifted by a stunning but very mad blond woman whom he follows to an expensive town house in Boston 's posh Beacon Hill neighborhood . The woman 's brother propositions him . Things quickly go downhill from there . A perfect fit for for Gina Gershon , Edward Norton and Juliette Lewis , for starters . <p> The Crying Heart Tattoo . About 15 years ago my friends and I were passing around David Martin 's novels , especially The Crying Heart Tattoo . The book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Felicity Annabel Arlington Jones , who is funny , wicked and tells great stories . It is a story full of strange twists and odd tales and all kinds of heartbreaking digressions . Then again , movies , unlike books , do n't like digressions . Martin may be an author far too subtle for Hollywood . <p> Perfume . The movies have not really done a period piece until they 've done Perfume , Patrick Suskind 's odiferous 1986 novel about a serial killer in Paris in the mid-18th century . Who can resist a story with this early sentence : " The streets stank of manure , the courtyards of urine , the stairwells stank of moldering wood and rat droppings , the kitchens of spoiled cabbage and mutton fat ; the unaired parlors stank of stale dust , the bedrooms of greasy sheets , damp featherbeds , and the pungently sweet aroma of chamberpots . " This is an incredible story of a skilled perfumer  --  it is France , these are Frenchmen , and there are a multitude of body odors to mask  --  who kills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strange ? You bet . And wonderful . And if the movies ever perfect Smell-O-Vision , this one would be a redolent hit . <p> Waltz in Marathon . One of Chicago 's fine novelists and short story writers is Charles Dickinson , and I ca n't for the life of me understand why nobody has filmed Marathon . It has all of the charms that made Richard Russo 's Nobody 's Fool a favorite in print and film . Dickinson 's protagonist is Harry Waltz , a loan shark in Michigan . Paul Newman can do this one , too . <p> I Got ta Be Me . Finally , notwithstanding a recent independent documentary , Hollywood has missed its biggest bet of all time by not filming as a feature movie a memoir by a little woman with a huge heart and a pound of eyeliner . <p> Yes , it 's Tammy Faye Bakker , ex-wife of the debauched televangelist Jim Bakker , and the book is an aptly named memoir that leaves no tear duct untapped . Few life stories are as chock full o ' nuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a killer . But what film would not be a hit with a scene in which Tammy 's dog ChiChi drops dead from an overdose of lima beans and Jim gives the dog to a visiting real estate agent with the instructions not to bury it ( it was wintertime , thank God ) until Tammy settled the question of whether or not God could raise ChiChi from the dead ? ( He could n't . ) <p> I see Tori Spelling as Tammy Faye , in the role she was put on this earth for , Larry Storch as Jim ( only because Herve Villechaize is dead ) and Don Knotts as the real estate agent .
