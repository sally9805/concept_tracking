<p> SANTA MONICA , Calif.  --  The founders of MySpace wish they had a little more space of their own . <p> On a recent morning at restaurant at this popular Southern California beach , Chris DeWolfe and Tom Anderson barely finished their eggs before they were approached . <p> This time it 's an executive of an obscure website looking to form a partnership . Other times they 're rushed by rabid fans of their personal Web page community . <p> " I usually let Tom talk to them , " says DeWolfe , chuckling as he looks at Anderson . " He 's better at getting rid of them . " <p> Talk about instant entrepreneurial success . A little more than two years ago , MySpace did n't even exist . Today , it 's one of the Web 's hottest sites  --  beating eBay , Google and Amazon.com in the number of page views in December , says ComScore Media Metrix . <p> Even U2 and Madonna have pages on the site , which lets people build personal Web pages to express their interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The outpouring of interest in MySpace has been so strong DeWolfe and Anderson wo n't even list the company 's name on the office lobby directory . Employees shuffle quietly in an out of an unmarked door . As a condition of agreeing to cooperate with this story , the company said no information be could be provided about its location other than it 's in Santa Monica . <p> It 's not that DeWolfe , 40 , and Anderson , 29 , are unfriendly , standoffish or anti-social . It 's just that the groundswell of interest in the website they created has overwhelmed them . <p> Their success in such a short time is breathtaking and in some ways an entrepreneurial case study . A once-obscure website that has become a cultural phenomenon for the under-30 set , much as MTV captivated the generation before . <p> It 's apparently captivated some of the over-30 set , too : Last year Rupert Murdoch and his News Corp . bought MySpace.com and parent Intermix Media for $580million . When the deal was announced in July , Murdoch said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as MySpace.com , are some of the Web 's hottest properties and resonate with the same audiences that are most attracted to Fox 's news , sports and entertainment offerings . " <p> An unusual success <p> DeWolfe and Anderson 's success is intriguing because they did it by defying just about every cliche about starting a business . <p> MySpace was n't the first business the two created . The idea for the site dawned on them in late 2003 when they were working at an Internet marketing firm they had created and sold to Intermix . <p> Anderson , who tinkered with the online " bulletin boards " in the ' 80s that were precursors to today 's chat rooms , was convinced the world was ready for a site that would let users talk about things they loved , ranging from their favorite bands to movies and games . <p> Defying the odds <p> The site counted on various forms of advertising , including banner ads , to survive . That was a scary proposition in January 2004 , just a few years after an Internet advertising recession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially banner ads . <p> The two dabbled with other forms of ads , such as " featured profiles . " Those allowed companies , including Procter &; Gamble , to pay for prominent links on the front page of MySpace.com that would make it easier for users to find pages promoting their products . <p> Also , they had experience because this was the second company they founded . They previously created an Internet advertising firm called RB Marketing in 2001 , so they knew firsthand that online ads were booming and could sustain a business model . <p> And while baby boomers are petrified of identity theft , MySpace relies on its users volunteering personal information and photos of themselves and posting them on the Web for all to see . <p> MySpace was n't even the first website of its kind . Sites like Friendster were doing similar things at the time . <p> But DeWolfe and Anderson were n't concerned . They first met during the dot-com boom when they were both working for a online-storage company called Xdrive . Anderson was attending film school and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people willing to try the company 's products . DeWolfe was vice president of sales and marketing at Xdrive and says Anderson 's comments were so valuable he hired him as a copy editor . <p> At Xdrive , the two learned from the mistakes the company made . For instance , they marveled when executives persisted with ideas that did n't catch on right away . The beauty of online businesses is knowing immediately if they 'll work , Anderson says . <p> That 's why the two knew straight away they had something : Traffic at MySpace surged from the get-go . <p> " I tend to see people trying to do stuff that is an uphill struggle , " Anderson says . " Pay attention to what works , and do that . " <p> Meanwhile , unlike other " social networking " sites that turned away musicians and artists using the sites to promote themselves , MySpace embraced them . It added tools enabling bands to upload their music , so consumers could easily download and listen to it . <p> That turned out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was cool to be on MySpace . Users jumped onto the site and not only checked out their favorite bands but listed the bands they liked . It created a word-of-mouth buzz cycle that got the music industry 's attention . More than a million bands and artists now have MySpace pages . <p> " It was n't that long ago when nobody knew what this site was , " says Matt Shiv , music director at online music station woxy.com , which features and discovers independent musicians . " Now it is becoming a mandatory thing bands must do to get promoted . " <p> Major bands ranging from Depeche Mode to Nine Inch Nails and Weezer have launched albums on MySpace . <p> MySpace " went against all the odds , " says Geoffrey Yang , partner with Redpoint , the only venture-capital firm that invested in MySpace . " It surprised us , " says Yang , whose firm also invested in Tivo and Netflix . <p> DeWolfe and Anderson 's success , Yang says , was largely due to monitoring what users were doing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really good job of figuring out what 's important and just doing it , " he says . " They are some of the best entrepreneurs I 've ever worked with . ... I 'd work with them again in a second . " <p> Obstacles and opportunities <p> That 's not to say there are n't problems . MySpace employs a staff of about 12 who do nothing but look at all 1.5 million images uploaded each day for inappropriate photos , including pornography . Advertisers are sensitive about what types of content their brands appear by , DeWolfe says . Despite their efforts , some illicit images still get through <p> Meanwhile , the two are hoping to boost MySpace 's popularity in the taste-selling agenda . Late last year , the site teamed with Interscope Records to create a record label . One of the bands featured on their first compilations is Hollywood Undead , which they discovered on MySpace , naturally . <p> Next , there are plans to work more closely with filmmakers to create the same word-of-mouth buzz for films . <p> " Bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " This could be a tool for ( movie ) studios too . " <p> And that 's one of the final ironies about the company . For a site that rejoices in individuals ' interests beyond work and school , Anderson says he works most of the time . His online profile lists interests ranging from the history of communism to weight lifting , travel , hiking and writing music . But when asked what he does in his spare time , he says , " I really do nothing else but work . "  - -  Why MySpace rocks <p> If you 're more than 30 years old , you may never have heard of MySpace . To save you the embarrassment if a Gen Y-er asks you if you have a MySpace page , keep reading . <p> MySpace is a suddenly popular website that surpassed the traffic of eBay and Amazon.com based on the number of pages viewed by users . <p> Do n't think of MySpace as a Web page , though . It 's a universe of hundreds of thousands of personal Web pages created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages any way they want , kind of the same way high schoolers decorate the insides of their lockers . MySpace pages can be adorned with digital photos of their owners or things they think are cool . Users can also list interests , which usually include their favorite bands . <p> But this is where the power of MySpace kicks in . Let 's say you 're into Olympic curling and magic tricks . Other magicians who are curling fans can search MySpace and locate others that share that same combination of interests . When they visit your site , they can learn about you , and if they choose , add a link to their page and call themselves a " friend . " And while they 're there , visitors can see a list of all the other people who list you as a friend and click on their pages . <p> But it 's not just a way to learn about people with common interests . It 's also a massive source of personal endorsements . For instance , let 's say you land on a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're a fan of a band called " Panic ! At the Disco . " You can click on the link , learn about the band and listen to its music . <p> Users can also list their favorite products as friends , which gives them an electronic word of mouth . PHOTO , B/W
