A double major in neuroscience and computer science would keep most college kids pretty busy . But when Yale junior Joshua Newman , 20 , scampered across campus this spring , he was n't thinking too much about finals . He was more concerned with raising $10 million by the fall  --  and then giving it away . A native of ( where else ? ) Palo Alto , Calif. , Newman just happens to be a budding venture capitalist , one of the early-stage investors who fund high-tech ventures before they go public , in exchange for a potentially lucrative stake . His fledgling fund , Paradigm Blue , plans to give about $500,000 to promising dorm-room start-ups that ca n't possibly get a meeting with the cozy club of old-line VCs . <P> Newman has already raised some $8 million . Until recently it was n't too hard , even for an undergraduate , to line up donations . As long as tech stocks were pushing the NASDAQ index to record highs , VCs could take scores of seedling companies public before they had time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent market downturn does n't seem to faze Newman . " We 're taking a long-term view , " he says , like a Silicon Valley pro . <P> Well , what choice does he have ? For the moment , at least , NASDAQ is n't rolling out the welcome mat for most dotcoms , and high-flying Internet IPOs are practically a distant memory . Like his fellow VC wannabes , from buyout king Henry Kravis to anonymous Florida retirees , Newman is n't about to let a little thing like a bear market crush his dreams of jump-starting the next Yahoo and riding it to the bank . Never mind that the vast majority of VC bets have failed or that inexperienced players may have a tough time picking winners in a choppy market . <P> " A lot of people have been moving into the industry assuming it was all reward and no risk , " says Chris Nawn , a general partner at Technology Crossover Ventures . By contrast , Nawn 's company has warned its investors not to expect the stratospheric returns of recent years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funneled into start-ups , almost three times 1998 's total , according to Venture Economics , a division of Thomson Financial Securities Data . That does n't include an estimated $30 billion more in seed capital plunked down by " angels , " wealthy individual investors who help get start-ups going before they hit up the VCs . Through the first three months of this year , that feverish pace continued , with VCs doling out $23 billion , mostly to dotcom prospects . <P> Celebrities and sports stars , from Martha Stewart to Joe Montana , are jumping on the VC bandwagon . In the past several months , corporate heavyweights IBM , News Corp. , Time Warner ( parent of TIME ) and Arthur Andersen , to name a few , have launched their own funds . Even the CIA has set up a venture arm , In-Q-Tel . And later this year , Silicon Valley start-up MeVC , along with VC Draper Fisher Jurvetson , will roll out a publicly traded venture fund that lets individuals with a net worth of at least $150,000 plunk down a minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
