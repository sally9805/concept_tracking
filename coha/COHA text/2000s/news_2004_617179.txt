<p> The two high-rise towers proposed for the shores of Lake Lanier in Gainesville sound as if they could be pulled out of Tom Wolfe 's " A Man in Full . " <p> Mixed-use skyscrapers rising out of nowhere . A fancy restaurant at the top . Thirty Steinway pianos placed in condominiums and public spaces . <p> " You could n't very well miss it , the dome , out in its splendid leafy loneliness , " Wolfe writes of his fictional Croker Concourse , a 40-story tower in Cherokee County that 's 60 percent empty and hemorrhaging money . <p> The proposed Canterbury at Lake Lanier would contain 750,000 square feet in two towers , one 34 stories , the other 36 . A robotic valet would park cars . A helipad would shuttle wealthy condominium tenants and hotel guests back and forth to Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport , nearly 70 miles away . <p> The developer is proposing 150 condos , ranging from 1,350 to 3,500 square feet each , and its 34 hotel rooms would have " the amenities of a six-star boutique hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intersection of Thompson Bridge and Old Thompson Bridge roads in Hall County , a few miles north of Gainesville 's quaint downtown . <p> But the company proposing to build the cylindrical towers  --  Endeco International , a sole proprietorship based in New York  --  has no track record as a developer . Its principal , R. Eric Castro , wo n't discuss who will finance the $325 million project . <p> Castro said he has worked with other construction companies on large projects in New York as a contractor or construction manager . But some say he has overstated his roles . In Troy , Mich. , Endeco has not filed a site plan for a multimillion-square-foot mixed-use project Castro has been talking about for at least four years . <p> He acknowledges that his Georgia plans  --  to attract " people of wealth , position and power " to lake-view condos selling for $1.5 million to $6 million  --  are his most grandiose . " No one has ever done anything so ambitious in the entire country , " he said recently by telephone from New York . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to New York as a political refugee in 1960 , acknowledges that he has little experience with a project of this scope . <p> " My track record as a developer is nominal , " he said . " I spent 30 years running a construction company . " <p> ' Six-star ' quality <p> Late last year Castro met with leaders in Gainesville , but he has not filed enough information for a rezoning application , said Matt Tate , principal planner for the city . If Endeco files the list of documents requested by Gainesville 's planning and development officials by Thursday , the project could go to the planning commission in March and before the City Council in April , Tate said . <p> Endeco is asking for rezoning of the land , some of which is designated commercial , to accommodate the planned residential development . Castro also wants Gainesville to annex about three acres of the property now in unincorporated Hall County , according to preliminary plans filed with the city . The 10.6 acres he plans to buy has several owners . <p> City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they 're flattered that a New York developer would want to construct a mega-project there . If it 's built , the development could generate millions of dollars in property taxes . <p> " Gainesville is a quality place , " said Mayor George Wangemann , who took office last week and served as a city councilman for 17 years . " I can understand why people want to live here and have a view of a lake and the mountains in the background . " Wangemann has not met Castro . <p> Castro said he sees a market for his project because of Georgia 's temperate climate and the South 's " romantic appeal " of history and tradition . Travelers also can easily get from Hartsfield-Jackson to anywhere in the world , he noted . " If you want to sell condos in the price range of $1.5 million , you have to be able to access a global market . " <p> Castro said he could envision real estate brokers operating from England , Australia , South Africa and Latin America marketing his towers . What would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of security that could make someone like the Sultan of Brunei feel comfortable . The security and advanced telecommunications services could earn the property a " six-star " rating , he said . <p> But that designation does n't exist in North America , said Shane O'Flaherty , vice president of the Mobil Travel Guide , which ranks 10,500 hotels in the United States and Canada on a one-to-five-star system . He said he does n't know of a six-star hotel . <p> Castro said he thinks his property would call for a six-star category . <p> More talk than action ? <p> Officials in Troy say Endeco is more talk than substance . <p> Endeco proposed an ambitious project called the Carlton Center there , but Castro has n't made any move to build it , said Doug Smith , Troy 's real estate and development director . " I did my due diligence , " he said . " I found no evidence that he accomplished anything that he told me . " <p> Smith said Castro told Troy officials he was working with the mayors ' offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither of which had any substance , and nothing had ever been completed or done or even started , " Smith said . " Everyone was a dead end . He name-drops . " <p> What planners say they found more troubling is that Endeco proposed to knock down the Michigan city 's tallest building , the 25-story Top of Troy . But he does n't own it , nor had he approached the owner , said Jeanine Mixdorf , director of marketing for Kojaian Co. , which owns the building . She declined to comment on the Endeco proposal other than to say her company has no plans to tear down the building , which is about 85 percent occupied . <p> Castro said his plans to demolish the Top of Troy were " exaggerated " and that he will submit plans in Michigan by June . " Of course we have n't filed , " he said . " All the pieces are n't in place . " <p> In a two-page summary of his background and his company 's experience , Castro says he has worked on several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tishman Construction Corp . of New York as a joint-venture partner " and says " Endeco Group served as construction manager " for Riverbank State Park in Manhattan . <p> Allan Paull , who was senior project manager for two phases of the park and is now Tishman 's vice president , said those statements are n't true . " They were n't a construction manager for Tishman on this job , nor were they a joint-venture partner of Tishman , " he said of Endeco . " They provided sub-consulting services . " <p> Paull said Endeco managed the minority and women-owned business enterprise and equal-opportunity program , a small part of the project . " They did a good job , " he said . <p> Paull also noted that the project 's scope was about $125 million , not $350 million as Castro said . <p> Castro said Paull 's description of Endeco 's role was " not the way we see it . We did more than what they talked about .

He said he did the work on behalf of Santa Fe Construction Inc. , a New York-based company . <p> Wank Adams Slavin Associates LLP , a New York-based architectural , engineering and preservation firm , designed a new waterproofing and drainage system for the two buildings and a plaza connecting them  --  about a $3 million job . Douglas Wasama , an associate with the firm , said Castro " was the key person representing Santa Fe on the project . He worked with us prior to bidding the project , then he evaluated the bids and coordinated the construction . " <p> Castro also said he represented Santa Fe as " co-director of construction " on Jazz at Lincoln Center , a $128 million , 100,000-square-foot performing arts center . Sander Gossard , project director for Jazz at Lincoln Center , said , " Eric was part of the Santa Fe team " although he did pre-construction work . <p> Officials with Santa Fe said they can not confirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm . " <p> Castro said he was n't surprised . " We did n't have the best relationship , and I do n't want to say anything negative . " <p> In Gainesville , Endeco has made an offer to buy nearly five acres from Don Hall , chief executive officer of Jones &; Hall Ventures . Hall said he 's been looking for a buyer for nearly six years . He declined to say how much Endeco has offered for his lakefront land or to detail the " significant " earnest money Endeco has provided as a nonrefundable deposit on the deal . <p> " I really expect it to close any day , " said Hall , who said Endeco has retained him for project management services and promised him a $1.5 million condo at or below cost . Hall said he worked as a project manager for AT &T; for 28 years , and in this project he has helped select the local attorney and public relations firm and assemble the land . <p> A question of demand <p> Can the Canterbury attract people to buy such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , president of Norton Agency , a real estate and insurance business in Gainesville , said such people would require high-end services not found in Gainesville . <p> " You 've got to have a reason to come here , " Norton said . " In essence , they 'd need to build a city with restaurants and upscale shopping , fitness club amenities . " <p> But luxury on the far outskirts of metro Atlanta is n't unheard of . In April 2002 , the Ritz-Carlton opened Reynolds Plantation , a four-star resort at Lake Oconee , 80 miles east of downtown Atlanta . General Manager Steven Freund said the majority of guests who stay at the hotel come from no more than 500 miles away . <p> " Unless you 've got an attraction that 's unique to this part of the world that nobody can get anywhere else , it will continue to be that way , " Freund said .
