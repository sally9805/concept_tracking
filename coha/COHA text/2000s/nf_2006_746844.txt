Three planets come together before dawn in the tightest grouping we 'll see for nearly 50 years <p> Following an autumn when many planets played hide-and-seek with the Sun , winter debuts with a full slate of Solar System targets . The show starts slowly  --  the early evening sky remains quiet in the first part of December . As the month progresses , Venus climbs into view in the southwest . Most other planets would be invisible against the twilight glare , but the brightest planet becomes conspicuous by midmonth . <p> Venus gleams at magnitude - 3.9 in January , a beacon even against the backdrop of bright winter stars . Unfortunately , Venus ' telescopic appearance does n't match its brilliance . The planet 's disk appears nearly full and measures 11 " across in late January . <p> Use Venus to find Mercury during January 's final week . The elusive inner planet lies to Venus ' lower right and will be a snap to see through binoculars . Mercury appears surprisingly bright  --  shining at magnitude - 1.0  --  but never rises totally out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disk to be about half Venus ' size . <p> The " star " of the evening sky rises in the east after twilight ends . Saturn lies among the background stars of Leo , not far west of that constellation 's brightest star , Regulus . The planet shines a magnitude brighter than the star , so you should n't have a problem identifying it . Saturn 's pale-yellow hue and steady , non-twinkling glow also set it apart from the stars . <p> But Saturn truly shines when you view it through a telescope . Even a small scope shows the beautiful rings , which span 45 " in early January . On nights with good seeing  --  when Earth 's atmosphere is relatively tranquil and images appear steady  --  you should see the dark Cassini Division separating the outer A ring from the brighter B ring . The view improves noticeably if you wait until after midnight for Saturn to climb high in the south . <p> The rest of the bright planets appear shortly before dawn . The brightest is Jupiter , which stands out against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in January . Although it stays low in early December , you wo n't want to miss its meeting with fellow planets Mars and Mercury . <p> On the 9th , Mercury and Mars come within 1.0 of each other . The next day , Mercury passes 0.1 from Jupiter . The three appear closest together on the 10th , when they all lie within a circle 1.0 across . Jupiter shines brightest of the three , followed by Mercury and then Mars . Binoculars or a telescope with a wide-angle eyepiece will afford the best views of this rare conjunction . You wo n't see a closer gathering of three naked-eye planets until the same trio comes together in 2053 . <p> After the conjunction , Jupiter climbs higher in the morning sky . Telescope owners should wait until late January before studying the giant planet closely . By then , it appears reasonably high in the southeast before dawn and above the worst atmospheric turbulence . Expect to see a 34 " - diameter disk with two parallel , brownish belts straddling a brighter equatorial zone . <p> Mars also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it has a tougher time . Mars moves eastward on the sky much faster than Jupiter , so the Red Planet keeps better pace with the Sun and thus separates slowly . Even in late January , Mars still rises around the beginning of twilight . And the planet 's disk measures just 4 " across and shows no detail . <p> As December begins , Mercury is on the down side of the year 's best morning apparition for northern observers . The planet remains visible until midmonth , but its chief claim to fame is as one member of the planetary trio . A telescope reveals a gibbous disk some 6 " across on December 1 . <p> Two of the three most prolific meteor showers peak during these long winter nights . The Geminids can produce up to 120 meteors per hour under the darkest skies . This year , a waning crescent Moon slightly hinders viewing at the shower 's peak on December 14 . Best viewing comes after midnight when the shower 's radiant ( which lies in the constellation Gemini ) lies highest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when a Full Moon will wipe out most meteors . The Stern 's Stellar Clusters <p> Northern observers usually do n't pay much attention to the constellations that once made up Argo Navis , the Ship of the Argonauts . This giant ship sailed the southern skies until the 18th century , when French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille divided it into four more manageable parts : Carina the Keel , Puppis the Stern , Pyxis the Compass , and Vela the Sails . Most northerners think the ship 's parts lie too far south to provide any targets worth exploring . <p> But northern Puppis actually extends farther north than Sirius  --  the brightest star in the sky and Puppis ' neighbor to the west . Two exceptional star clusters lie along the spine of the Milky Way in northern Puppis . You can find both M46 and M47 13 east of Sirius and 20 south of Procyon . <p> M47 shines at 4th magnitude , bright enough to pick up easily with the naked eye from a dark-sky site . This cluster stands out nicely when viewed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , however , and the scene proves a little disappointing . Approximately 50 stars fill the cluster 's half-degree diameter , but there 's not much central concentration . <p> Magnificent M46 glows at 6th magnitude just 1 east of M47 . Through an 8-inch telescope , M46 shows more than 100 stars packed into a circle spanning about 0.4 . If you look closely , you 'll see a tiny smoke ring near the cluster 's northern edge . M46 is one of a few open clusters that contains a planetary nebula  --  NGC 2438 appears 1 ' across and distinctly non-stellar . To see the ring structure , use high magnification .
