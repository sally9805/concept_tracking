The time came for her to die , and she would not die ; so perhaps she might waste away , they thought , and she did waste , but not away ; and the time came for her to receive final absolution , so they set candles upon her clavicle , but this she would not allow . She blasphemed with gusto and she knocked the scented oils across the shroud they 'd readied on a trestle nearby . <p> " God love her , " they said , in bitter , unconvincing voices  --  or perhaps they meant May the Unnamed God love her , our unrepentant sister Yackle , for we certainly ca n't . <p> " Sink me in the crypt , " she said , speaking directly to them for the first time in years . " You 're too young to know ; that 's how they used to do it . When the time came for an elder to go and she would n't , they settled her down in the ossuary so she could chummy up to the bones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wine . Let her get used to the notion . They came back a year later to sweep up the leavings . " <p> " Mercy , " said whoever was nearby to hear . <p> " I insist , " she replied . " Check with Sister Scholastica and she 'll bear me out . " " She 's raving mad , " said someone else , chocolately . Yackle approved of chocolate , and indeed , everything edible . Since Yackle 's eyesight had gone out for good a decade earlier , she identified individuals by the degree and idiosyncracy of their halitosis . <p> " She 's always been raving mad , " said a third observer , Vinegarish Almonds . " Is n't that rather sweet ? " <p> Yackle reached for something to throw , and all she could find was her other hand , which would n't detach . <p> " She 's doing sign language . " " The poor , deluded dovelette . " " Clinging to life so  --  whatever for ? " " Perhaps it is n't her time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it is , I keep telling you . Wo n't you fiends let me die ? I want to go to hell in a handbasket . Put me out of my misery and into the Afterlife where I can do some real damage , damn it . " <p> " She 's not herself , " said someone . <p> " She was never reliably herself , to hear tell , " said another . <p> The bedsheets caught fire spontaneously . Yackle found she was rather enjoying this , but it helped neither her reputation nor her rescue that the only liquid nearby with which to douse the flames was cognac . <p> Still , Yackle was not to be dissuaded . " Is n't there a Superior in the House ? " she asked . " Someone who can lay down the law ? " <p> " The Superior Maunt died a decade ago , " they replied . " We work by consensus now . We 've noted your request to be interred alive . We 'll put it on the agenda and take it up next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House down , and us with it , " muttered a novice , sometime later . Yackle could tell that the innocent speaker was talking to herself , to stoke her courage . <p> " Come here , my duckie , " said Yackle , grasping . " I smell a little peppermint girl nearby , and no garlicky matron hovering . Are you the sentry ? On our own , are we ? Come , sit nearer . Surely there is still a Sister Apothecaire in residence ? With her cabinets of nostrums and beckums , tonics and tablets ? She must possess a sealed jar , it would be dark blue glass , about yea-high , pasted over with a label picturing three sets of crossed tibias . Could n't you find this and pour me out a fatal little decoction ? " <p> " Not a spoonful of it , I e n't the grace to do it , " said Peppermint Girl . " Let go a me , you harpy . Let go or  --  or I 'll bite you ! " <p> Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do the poor girl no good to take a bite of old Yackle . The antidote e n't been invented yet , and so on . <p> Hours and days pass at elastic rhythms for the blind . Whether the pattern of her naps and wakings followed the ordinary interruptions of daylight by nighttime , Yackle could n't tell . But someone she recognized as Broccoli Breath eventually informed her that the sorority had decided to bow to Yackle 's final wish . They would install her in the crypt among the remains of women long dead . She could approach bodily corruption at whatever speed appealed to her . Three candles , and as to nourishment , red or white ? <p> " A beaker of gasoline and a match as a chaser , " said Yackle , but she was indulging in a joke ; she was that pleased . She nominated a saucy persimmon flaucande and a beeswax candle scented with limeberries  --  for the aroma , not for the light . She was beyond light now . <p> " Good voyage , Eldest Soul , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs . Though she weighed no more than sugarbrittle she was awkward to move ; she could n't govern her own arms or legs . As if motivated by a spite independent of her own , her limbs would keep ratcheting out to jab into doorjambs . The procession lacked a fitting dignity . <p> " Do n't come down for at least a year , " she sang out , giddy as a lambkin . " Make that two . I might be old as sin itself , but once I start rotting it wo n't be pretty . If I hammer at the cellar door do n't open it ; I 'm probably just collecting for some public charity in hell . " <p> " Can we serenade you with an epithalamium , as you go to marry Death ? " asked one of the bearers , tucking in the shroud to make it cozy . <p> " Save your doggy breath . Go , go , on to the rest of your lives , you lot . It 's been a swell , mysterious mess of a life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candles out before I lower my own lights . " <p> A year later when a sister ventured into the crypt to prepare for another burial , she came across the hem of Yackle 's shroud . She wept at the notion of death until Yackle sat up and said , " What , morning already ? And I having those naughty dreams ! " The maunt 's tears turned to screams , and she fled upstairs to start immediately upon a long and lively career as an alcoholic . <p> <br> Continues ...
