The Sapphire Sea Chapter One Happy Bull It was 6:45 A.M. when the sun 's blazing rays of amber light finally blasted over the horizon . Lonny cruised down a stretch of open macadam flanked by lizard green hills and fetid rice paddies . He was past the mining camps and inside the King 's Reserve . He had the throttle wrenched back , the clutch lever squeezed tight and was in the act of kicking the Japanese road pony into third . And it was just a flash . A hallucinogenic glint of phosphorescence in a crosshatched sea of chartreuse yellow , ocher red and black ash . The motorcycle coasted at a high-pitched whine as Lonny 's eye processed the color , and a magical sensation welled up inside his chest like a balloon . He told himself to push on but the curse and the salvation of Lonny 's life was his eye . Lonny had a seeing eye . An eye that could weigh , cut and mount a gemstone by holding it to the sun . The eye of an artist . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As he whipped around in the saddle to locate the blue glimmer , the motorcycle veered into freshly tilled soil and his body catapulted forward like a human cannonball . He plowed into the sponge-like paddy helmet-first . Mud jammed up around the visor and left him with a intimate view of a tropical millipede . After two years in Madagascar there were still some mornings he found the place surreal . It was the fourth time he had taken a digger , each time in a paddy , and each time it had required a team of zebu to pull the machine free of the sticky muck . But this time he was not overly concerned about himself , his predicament or the danger of getting caught inside the King 's Reserve . He could feel his body temperature rise and his eye twitch as he thought about an improbable twinkle that promised a glimpse of the divine . He pushed himself off the fallow ground and glanced around . In the near distance he spotted a middle-aged peasant sitting away from the deserted highway beneath a towering mango @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident without understanding and without trying to understand . The peasant was lifting a blue stone up to the sun , as he had seen the traders do in the sapphire camps , trying to see what he could sense . Lonny wiped the mud from his visor and surveyed the damage . The front tines of the motorcycle were twisted , the wheel rim bent , the engine covered with soil . With luck he might be able to ride it back to Diego-Suarez . He removed his mirrored helmet and walked woodenly toward the gigantic mango tree . His body was drenched in a heavy layer of sweat before he was halfway there . " M'boulets tsara , " greeted Lonny in the local dialect . Once a week he submitted to Antakarana lessons from Bishop McKenzie , an aged Scottish missionary who had not spoken English for months at a go before Lonny parachuted into town . " M'boulets tsara , " returned Jaoravo , the Happy Bull , a descendant of Jao , the Bull . Unlike the landless miners from the highlands and the south , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations . It was a part of his feet , his hands , his stomach . Everything he harvested he owed to the ancestors ' good grace . " J'achete des saphirs , " said Lonny , switching to French . As a boy his French mother had impressed upon him that " the beautiful language " was the language of love . At New York University he had majored in French because it was supposed to be the language of literature and art . Yet in northern Madagascar all his years of St. Exupry , Sartre and Duras served a commercial end . Jaoravo listened to Lonny and heard nothing malevolent . " Vous avez un saphir ? " continued Lonny , hoping he would not have to try the whole thing in dialect . At the time of independence Jaoravo had finished his schooling and he was proud of his ability to speak French . The young men in the nearby village called him the Frenchman because they liked to tease him . He did not mind the teasing . He was proud of his ability to communicate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not feel ashamed before the ancestors . Lonny 's legs were limber , as he had only been riding a short time , but he lost balance when Jaoravo rotated his palm and extended his arm to reveal a luminous sapphire the size of a swan 's egg . " C'est un vrai saphir , " said Jaoravo . A real one . And he knew it was . For although he knew nothing about sapphires in particular , he sensed the force of the stone , and from what he had heard , all the good stones were sapphires . The stone had a presence not unlike the sacred tree where he offered white-faced male ducks to the departed . He had discovered the blue stone in his rice paddy as he turned the soil with a squared spade . He had been carrying it for months , but now he felt himself unaccountably sad and he wanted to make a tribute to the ancestors . He wanted to sacrifice a zebu in their honor and he thought that if he took the disturbing blue stone to town surely one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lonny picked the wondrous sapphire from Jaoravo 's work-beaten palm and held it against the washed turquoise sky . The stone was the color of a delphinium on the summer side of a mountain , as clear as a bell 's chime . He closed his eyes briefly in delight and behind his eyelids he saw the magnificent sapphire float melodiously like a musical note . The gem did not filter the passage of light ...
