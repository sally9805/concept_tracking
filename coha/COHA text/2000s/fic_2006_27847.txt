Everyone 's Dead But Us A Tom &; Scott Mystery By Zubro , Mark Richard St. Martin 's Minotaur Zubro , Mark Richard I gazed from the headland toward the moon rising over the swelling waves , then shut my eyes and listened to the sea crashing on the rocks far below . I smelled the salt water and felt the coolness of the night through my polyester-padded leather jacket . The gusting east wind ruffled my hair . I stuck my hands into my jacket pockets , and reopened my eyes to gaze at the sky . It was possible to see the stars blaze as I never could over the city of Chicago . I 'd rarely seen the moon so enormous and orange and close , near enough in the darkness to dare to touch . Only a few clouds from the predicted storm lay on the horizon and I thought I caught glimpses of far distant lightning . I turned away from the sea toward the rest of the island . The gently rising land in front of me hid the few lights that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about two hundred feet away . I had been told to give him an hour so I had taken my time strolling the east way around the island . I loved the cool wind and the lack of human noise . Waves and wind , spray and smell , everything draped in moonlight and surrounded by stars . That 's why we come here every year . Total quiet and relaxation . I took the path down to the secluded cavern where Scott waited . Neither the anticipation nor the pleasure was lessenedby the familiarity with which I approached the scene . Love , and warmth , and a hot man . Nothing wrong with that picture even after numerous viewings . It was the day before New Year 's Eve . As a present for our wedding , I 'd given him annual trips to Korkasi , an island in the Aegean Sea . Korkasi was the most exclusive and expensive gay resort in the world . We 'd already been coming to this idyllic spot off and on for years before our marriage . It was one place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list on Korkasi included some of the wealthiest gay men on the planet . Many of them were the kind who 'd listened to too much opera as children , attended too many operas as an adult , and felt a need to tell you about those experiences . They funded more opera productions than you could shake a tenor at . Another common type is the rich sugar daddy trying to show off his latest boy-toy . At times these people overlapped each other , making us even more inclined to keep to ourselves . Scott would have candlelight and blankets and pillows , and cheeses and exotic fruits and confections and some form of chocolate that I 'd never had before . Scott would have taken the time to make it romantic and intimate and perfect . As I entered the cavern , I saw the glow of light around the bend . The wind abated considerably after the first few steps into the cave , and was but a puff of freshness after I turned the first corner . Scott had lit a fire , a necessity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red , blue , and yellow of the quiet flames provided welcome warmth . Smoke curled out through a small hole high up in the far wall . The shield of loose rocks built around the fire had been heated by the flames . He had votive candles on rock-hewn shelves stretching above our heads . He sat cross-legged on a blanket in front of a mound of pillows . A simple feast was laid out between him and the fire . Since I was a kid , I 've been afflicted with a sappy , romantic streak . Yeah , it was cheap sentiment , but I love cheap sentiment . And as a wise , old mentor once said to me , " Cheap sentiment ? So what ? Dickens made a career out of it . " I snuggled up close to Scott . He draped an arm around me . " This is perfect , " I said . Then both his arms encircled me , and he nuzzled my ear . " I love you , " he murmured . " I love you , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed a lot more . And for quite a while the fire was not necessary to keep us warm . Some time later , wrapped in blankets , having stirred the fire and added scented wood to its fading embers , Scott reached behind the mound of pillows . " I have something for you . " For some reason we nearly always whispered when we were in the cavern . Neither of us wished to break the magic of the spell created by these moments of perfection . Scott handed me a flat , burgundy box with gold lettering . It was tied with a silk , red ribbon , which fell away easily . The box said Kinder with other words in German that I could not translate . I opened it and took a bite of the chocolate inside . It was heavenly . Eventually reality does intrude . The fire did die down . The damp and cold did seep in . I was pleasantly drowsy , but it would be good to get indoors . Continues ... by Zubro , Mark Richard     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
