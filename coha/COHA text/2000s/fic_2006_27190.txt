Oh what a tangled web we weave , When we first practise to deceive . Sir Walter Scott , " Marmion " England , 1835 " It can not be true . " Lady Meredith Brookshire paced her drawing room , fisting the missive only just delivered into a crumpled ball . " Might I see the letter ? " her aunt asked , flicking her wrist in the air impatiently . " Before it is destroyed ? " Meredith blinked at the ball of parchment in her hand and quickly passed it to her aunt as if it were a deadly serpent . It might as well have been for the death knell it rang in her heart . They had found him . The new Lord Brookshire . The missive did not indicate where they had located him , but he would surely descend upon them soon . Like a vulture scenting its next meal . So much for the solicitors ' assurances that he was dead , she mused wryly . Despite those assurances , they had put forth a search for him anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law precisely ? Her aunt smoothed the crinkles out of the parchment , her expression growing perplexed as she scanned the message . " But , dearest , is n't he dead ? " Meredith continued to pace , rubbing the base of her palm against her forehead to ward off her impending headache . " Unless a ghost is aboutto descend upon us , Nicholas Caulfield is alive and well and intends to claim his inheritance . " She halted her pacing steps as the ugly significance of Nicholas Caulfield 's pending arrival washed over her . Ruin . Destitution . Doom settled like a heavy stone in her chest . Surely he would rid the premises of his half brother 's widow and her few clinging relatives . Then what ? They had no other family to take them in . And Edmund had not provided for her beyond his death . Not that she would have expected him to for all the care and thought he extended her over the years . Still , she had not anticipated her husband expiring so young . He had only been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of him might have been . Her hands balled into fists at her sides . " Blast Edmund ! Do not husbands set up jointures for their wives ? " " Do not curse , dearest , and do not speak ill of the dead , " Aunt Eleanor reproved with a chiding tsk . " Especially since he no doubt suffers in the throes of hell as we speak . " A smile tugged her lips at her aunt 's uncharacteristic spite . Aunt Eleanor 's nostrils quivered with disdain . " After all he put you through , the Almighty is not going to take a kindly view of him as he stands at Judgment . " " He did not put me through anything . " The lie tripped off Meredith 's tongue with practiced ease . " He was n't cruel or abusive . He was just  --  " She paused , groping for the appropriate word . Arriving at it , she shrugged and uttered , "  --  absent . " " For seven years , " Aunt Eleanor reminded hotly , her indignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was quite content with the arrangement . " Again , the fib fell smoothly . Content ? Lonely was more accurate . " Many wives would appreciate being rid of their husband 's oppressive yoke . " " Well , then he has put me through much suffering . Look at these dreadful frocks . I hate to speak uncharitably of the dead , even his rotten soul , but he 's getting the last word if we wear these ghastly gowns . " Aunt Eleanor plucked at the heavily starched black paramatta of her mourning dress . " I can not wear black for an entire year . And certainly not for him . I have n't a turban to match . " Meredith looked down at her dress and frowned . Her aunt was correct . Nothing could complement such atrocious gowns , matching turban or no . Aunt Eleanor 's gaze slid over her in distaste . " You look like a ghost . Completely washed out . " Meredith sighed and touched her cheek wistfully , knowing  --  with exception of a spattering of unfortunate freckles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown had little to do with her resembling a ghost . " We 're not in Town . This is Attingham , " Aunt Eleanor continued . " Who will comment if we only mourn for , say . . . three months ? " She shrugged one thin shoulder . " Everyone knew you had a disagreeable marriage . No one would blame us for the slight breach . " " My marriage was perfectly agreeable . " Meredith leveled a stern look on her aunt , annoyed by her allegation that everyone knew . If everyone knew , it was because her aunt 's complaints had reached all of Attingham . " Posh ! He embarrassingly neglected you . " " Only you were embarrassed , " Meredith reminded with the stoic facade she had mastered over the years . On certain days she could almost convince herself that the years of neglect did not bother her  --  days her aunt usually was n't around . " Appalling . The way he left you , simply appalling , " Aunt Eleanor forged ahead with the mercilessness of a battering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I warrant . Perhaps it 's best the old gent did not live to see his son abandon you . " " Well , the earl will no doubt get the heirs he always wanted . " Meredith sank down on the settee , arms falling limply at her sides . " Only from the wrong son . " " You should have borne those heirs . If Edmund had been any kind of husband , you would have a dozen babes by now . Not to have even consummated  --  " " Please . " Meredith lifted a hand to ward off the rest of her aunt 's words . Some memories were too bitter to speak aloud . The night her husband had refused to consummate their marriage and walked out on her was one such memory . " And now we will lose Oak Run to this . . . man , when it has been you caring for everything . " Aunt Eleanor counted off on her fingers . " You 've managed the house , the servants , the tenants , the dairy , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Meredith broke in , hot tears stinging the backs of her eyes . " I can do without the reminder . " She blinked fiercely , refusing to succumb to the tears bubbling just beneath the surface . Ever since she . . . Continues ...
