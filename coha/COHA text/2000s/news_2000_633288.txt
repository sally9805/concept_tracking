<p> ' Monet to Moore : <p> The Millennium Gift <p> of Sara Lee Corp . ' <p> Monday to May 29 <p> Art Institute of <p> Chicago , 111 S. Michigan <p> Adults , $ 8 ; children , students and seniors , $ 5 . <p> ( 312 ) 443-3600 <p> Somewhere on the 47th floor of Sara Lee 's posh offices at Three First National Plaza , executives are bummed . <p> The largest corporate art gift in history , on display at the Art Institute of Chicago with " Monet to Moore : The Millennium Gift of the Sara Lee Corp. , " has deprived them of the Picassos , Braques and Gauguins that decorated the wood-sheathed walls at Sara Lee . <p> " If you 're a ( chief financial officer ) or chief legal officer , you 're not necessarily educated to have a Braque or a Picasso , " said Sara Lee curator Richard Brettell . " It might not be the most exciting thing in your life until it goes away and you suddenly realize what you 're missing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a short one . <p> Chicago is the final stop for a five-city , globe-spanning tour of the 52 works in this show , a grouping that represents the cream of the Sara Lee art collection . It spans an almost hundred-year range from 1870 to 1960 , covering Impressionism to early modernism , Claude Monet to sculptor Henry Moore . <p> Represented , among other household names , are Claude Monet , Edgar Degas , Paul Gauguin , Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec , Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso . This show at the Art Institute is the last grouping of these works before they are distributed to the 40 institutions slated to receive them . Twelve of these will find a permanent home in the Art Institute , with most on display as part of the museum 's permanent collection in June . <p> " Each of these works by itself would be a wonderful addition to a collection , " said Stephanie D'Alessandro , Mellon Fellow in Modern and Contemporary Art . " When great things come up more and more rarely , and prices for modern and 20th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make major additions to collections . This gift is also amazing in that respect . " <p> " It 's like Christmas , " said Gloria Groom , European painting curator at the Art Institute . " They 're not dogs . These are really first-class paintings and drawings . We were able to pick things like the Gauguin and the late Pissarro , works that we did n't have anything like . And the Degas ( ' Breakfast After the Bath ' ) complements one given to us by ( Nathan ) Cummings in the 1970s . " <p> The gift of a collection estimated to be worth more than $ 100 million , announced in June 1998 , is remarkable on many levels . There 's the magnitude of the art being disbursed . But the awarding process was also a fascinating one . <p> Initially , the National Gallery in Washington , D.C. , New York 's Metropolitan Museum and the Art Institute were all told they could select a single work from the list of 52 that represented the best of Sara Lee 's artworks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because each had different strengths and needs . Then the Art Institute , in an example of home field advantage , was allowed to select 11 more works . <p> Brettell began the process of gifting based on the strengths and needs of the various institutions slated to receive pieces . Eventual recipients were selected based on their being located in an area where Sara Lee does business . <p> " Once it began and the first round was done , we hoped that we would actually hear from places who wanted to get gifts , " said Brettell , who has been involved with the Sara Lee Collection since its 1980 inception . " That was a really wonderful part of the process . And nobody knew in advance where everything was going to go . " <p> These works will be scattered about the globe from the Vatican Museum , to the Israel Museum in Jerusalem , who is getting the first Cummings work purchased , " Bountiful Harvest " by Camille Pissarro , to the Lauren Rogers Museum of Art in Laurel , Miss . <p> Part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its immensity , but also its diversity and scope . Chicago 's Museum of Contemporary Art , which did n't receive a work because the Sara Lee Collection predates its periods of interest , did receive a grant that will likely be used to acquire pieces for its permanent collection . <p> The David and Alfred Smart Museum at the University of Chicago was given " Phryne " by Aristide Maillol , a terra-cotta intended to serve as the model from which a bronze was cast . It supplements some smaller Maillols in the museum 's holdings . <p> " They were very thoughtful about what would fit into our collection , " said Kimerly Rorschach , Smart Museum director . " It 's educational in terms of the sculptor 's working methods . It 's not only beautiful , but art historically significant . " <p> The Sara Lee Collection began life as a tribute to the company 's founder , Nathan Cummings . In the late 1970s John Bryan , then Sara Lee chairman ( now head of the Art Institute Board of Trustees ) , heard that Cummings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his collection . <p> Working with Cummings , Bryan selected 23 works for installation in Sara Lee 's new corporate headquarters and began a collection based on the tenets that its quality be impeccable and that it be based on the original Cummings Collection . This was where Brettell entered the picture . <p> It was carefully assembled , and works that Cummings had already sold were repurchased whenever possible . Some gems , such as Picasso 's " Woman , Sculpture and Vase of Flowers " and some of Cummings ' Gauguins , were unattainable . They either were n't for sale or were too expensive for Sara Lee to consider . <p> So after all that effort , why give it away ? <p> " It 's not as big of a tax write-off as it used to be , but it 's a good thing to do , " said Thomas Hoving , former director of the Metropolitan , who oversaw the 1971 show of the Cummings Collection . " Many of these works , you would n't buy them as a museum , but the criteria ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " You begin to think , ' Is this really a responsible thing ? ' " Brettell said . " ' Should we keep these important things on the walls of the offices and dining rooms of the 47th floor , when works of the same quality are shown in major museums all over the world ? ' The fiscal and moral responsibilities of keeping the collection weighed on the corporation . " <p> The gift is also in keeping with the tradition of philanthropy established by Cummings and the corporation that he founded . While substantial , the net worth of this collection is n't very much when compared to the bottom line of a multibillion-dollar corporation . <p> Sara Lee also saw the recent sale of some of the Wallace Collection , forced by fiscal concerns at Reader 's Digest according to Brettell , solidifying their feeling that great art should not be a corporate asset . <p> So museumgoers get to see , for perpetuity , great works with placards that say " gift of the Sara Lee Corp . " Museums great and small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that inform later efforts by an artist . A corporation gets a write-off and some fantastic goodwill , while keeping the connection to its founder intact and in the public eye . <p> It seems that the only losers here are Sara Lee employees accustomed to seeing a Berthe Morisot or Pierre Bonnard as they head out for lunch . <p> " What better ending is there for a corporate collection than this one , " Brettell wondered . " And to have been part of the conceiving of that is much more satisfying than rearranging the paintings on the 47th floor every six months . "
