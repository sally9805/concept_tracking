// Dear Dr. Cory : What exactly is cancer ? I know someone who has it , and now her hair is gone . Is it contagious ? Colleen Baltimore , Maryland Dear Colleen : Cancer begins when normal body cells become abnormal and begin to grow uncontrollably . These cells spread and may grow into masses of tissue called tumors . Some tumors are malignant ( cancerous ) and will continue to grow . Some may be benign , or innocent , and stop growing . Benign tumors are not cancer . We wish we knew all the answers to why people get cancer . Infection with certain viruses can increase the chance of getting certain types of cancer . But you ca n't " catch " cancer from another person . There are many different kinds of cancer . We do know that many cancers result from several factors related to lifestyle , environment , and heredity . " Hereditary " just means that something in the genes that you were born with may eventually cause cancer to develop . // As I 'm sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either smokers or breathing secondhand smoke . Smoking greatly increases the chances of getting several different types of cancer . Almost one of every three cancer deaths is due to cigarette smoking , but even people who do n't smoke sometimes get cancer . One of the side effects of anticancer drugs can be hair loss . Once treatment has stopped , the hair usually grows back . Dear Dr. Cory : What are teeth made of ? Jake Via e-mail Dear Jake : The outer white part of the tooth is made of enamel , one of the hardest parts of the body . Under the enamel is cementum ( sea-MENT-um ) , which covers the root of the tooth and goes down into your gums . Then beneath that is dentin , which is a little harder than bone . In the soft middle is the pulp that contains blood vessels and nerve endings . // Your friend , Sidebar * Do not smoke or use smokeless tobacco . * Avoid heavy use of alcohol ( mouth cancer , liver cancer , and other cancers are found more often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun . * Have your house tested for radon. * Eat a varied , well-balanced diet with at least five servings of vegetables and fruits each day . * Avoid high-fat diets , and eat fewer salt-cured , smoked and nitrite-cured foods . * Keep a normal weight , and get plenty of exercise . Sidebar Teeth should be brushed for two minutes at least twice a day . With a soft toothbrush , brushing should be at a 45-degree angle against the gumline . Gently brush from where the tooth and gum meet to the chewing surface , in short strokes . Hard brushing can cause the gums to pull away from the teeth , causing tooth sensitivity and , eventually , loose teeth . All surfaces of the teeth should be brushed , inside and out . The chewing surfaces should be brushed with short back-and-forth motions , making sure the bristles get into the pits and crevices . The top and bottom front teeth and gums can be brushed by holding the toothbrush in an almost straight up-and-down position . Use the front part of the brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gums .
