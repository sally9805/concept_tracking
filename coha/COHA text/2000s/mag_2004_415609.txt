Five American Idol albums crash into stores over the next six weeks . When will record buyers say , " Enough " ? by Nicholas Fonseca // SHE PROBABLY DID N'T KNOW IT AT THE time , but when season 3 winner Fantasia belted " Have you ever reached a rainbow 's end ? " this summer , she was foreshadowing the careers of some of her pals on American Idol . Over the next six weeks , the show 's muscle-and the public 's desire for syrupy ballads-will be tested when five former winners and runners-up release new albums . They face not only each other but an unusually strong fall slate that includes Eminem , Good Charlotte , U2 , Destiny 's Child , Gwen Stefani , Snoop Dogg , and Ashanti . The plan to unleash five albums in such a short period is risky : It could overexpose a franchise that still has enormous appeal ( Fox 's Idol finished last season as TV 's No. 1 program ) and hurt BMG , the conglomerate behind all the entries . As for the artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a career in less time than it takes Ryan Seacrest to do his hair . To date , the public has proved its Idol worship only goes so far : About a third of the contestants who 've attempted solo albums have generated hits . On the high end , season 2 runner-up clay Aiken 's Measure of a Man sold 2.6 million copies , while bombs included season 1 runner-up Justin Guarini 's self-titled entry , which enticed just 142,000 buyers and assured his place in TV history as a perma-punchline . BMG North America CEO Clive Davis-who oversaw all five upcoming albums-is convinced that postshow success comes only by de-Idolizing contestants the minute they enter the recording studio . " There 's a certain song that all of America loves when that confetti comes down , but it really has no relevance to their recording career , " he says . " Once you get away from that single , you 're dealing with an original recording artist . I 'm not making American Idol albums . " Twenty-eight million fans might not appreciate Davis ' disdain , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box ) . As if to prove his point , Aiken refused to speak with EW-a sign , perhaps , that the wildly popular 25-year-old is tired of his close association with Idol . Others were more forthcoming : " It 's the reason I 'm here , " says Ruben Studdard . " Album producers do their best to scoot away from the Idol stigma , but I 'll never forget where I came from . " Kelly Clarkson agrees : " ' American Idol winner ' ' is going to be on my grave , " she says . " I 'll be a trivia answer for life . And still , with everything that I do , the people surrounding me tell me that they think that my next album will be what breaks me away from American Idol . And I have to ask , Why are we running from it ? " Well , because it 's a reality TV show and because there 's the lingering stench from flops by lesser-known ( and less beloved ) contestants : Tamyra Gray , RJ Helton , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 pop single . Says Billboard charts director Geoff Mayfield , " Idol is hugely successful at getting people to watch it on TV , but the artists have to make music that consumers connect with or they may not automatically buy their albums . " That 's the conundrum facing Fantasia and her runner-up , Diana DeGarmo , who may be hurt most by the glut because there 's so much talent on the market right now . Kevin Milligan , VP of product for Virgin Entertainment Group , warns that " they might find it more difficult to find their footing and get radio support because of their Idol competitors . " And , indeed , neither of their debut singles ( released in June ) made a dent on Top 40 radio , though they were strong at retail . What a marked contrast to Clarkson , Aiken , and Studdard , whose singles all reached No. 1 on Billboard 's hot 100 chart . " The show can hold us back . It can disappoint fans if they are expecting to hear what we sang on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for us to show our styles ... to show what 's behind the American Idol . " Clive Davis says amen to that . " It 's understandable that there is a skeptical aura around any artist who comes out of a television show . But it smacks of guilt by association . You 've got to forget what gave genesis to these artists . I do n't even think about where they came from anymore . " Easy for him to say .
