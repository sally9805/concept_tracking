" Have you heard ? Have you heard ? " cried Suzanne , running down to the edge of the swamp where the Dana boys were at work with their flax crop . " Captain Gushing has posted a notice that the settlement will have a big parade on the Fourth , with a prize for the child in the best , patriotic-est costume ! Polly Miles is sure she will get it if she wears her mother 's wedding gown of plum-colored double satin . And Tommy James is just as sure he 's going to get it , for he thinks his father will let him wear the captain 's uniform he had in the army . I tell him he 'll look awful in it , but he says he does n't care . What will you wear ? " Stephen stopped his work and rubbed his forehead thoughtfully . " I 'm sure I do n't know , Suzanne . I have n't any clothes at all except what I have on . " " That 's just like me , " the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my good linsey-woolsey that I wear for church service . Mother would never let me wear that to a celebration . My , I wish she 'd brought her wedding gown from the east , do n't you ? " Stephen smiled . " I do n't know as it would make much difference to me , and I do n't see how a wedding gown would be especially patriotic . " " No , perhaps it would not , " Suzanne admitted slowly . " But it would be very beautiful . And now I have ... nothing . " She pushed back her sunbonnet , and the wind from down-river came to ruf fle her hair . " You 're right pretty just as you are , n Stephen told her shyly . " I guess maybe I could help you to fix up a costume for the parade if I ever get this flax rippled and set to retting in the swamp . " ( Note : " Betting " meant to let a crop soak in water until the moisture caused the fiber part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could you ? Oh , goody ! Then let me help . And you tell me what you think of fixing . " She began handing up the long flax stems that he might draw them through the rippling-rake , snapping right and left the blossom-bolls . " Well , there are some fawn skins that were tanned soft and easy to work with , that Luther gave me from his hunting last fall . They are n't stout enough to stand hard wear on a boy like him-or me . But for you they 'd make a fine sort of coat and skirt . And you shall have squirrel fiu for trimming and a cap . " " For the Fourth of July-fur ? " Suzanne laughed . Then lest she hurt his feelings , she hurried on . " Fur would be lovely , even though it might be a little warm . Tonight can we start work on it ? I can sew quite nicely , if you will do the stiff cutting . " So , every day when they could spare time from other chores , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its fringed lower edges and its close-fitting squirrel cap . Unknown to Suzanne , Stephen started work also on a costume for himself . Many and many a time he wanted to run to her for advice-and for a little sewing-but he plodded on with it alone , making mistakes and patching them up himself , pricking his thumb and waiting only a moment for it to stop hurting . On the afternoon before the Fourth , when everything was ready , Suzanne came to him again . " Stephen-I'm-I 'm not going to be in the parade tomorrow , " she said sadly , not looking at him square in the eye . " You are n't ? " he cried , staring at her in amazement . " Did n't you like the hunter-girl suit ? " " Oh , I did ! I did like it . But you see it 's this way . Folly Miles could n't wear her mother 's wedding gown , after all . It was too fine for the stumpy path of the parade . And she felt so bad about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Shame on you , Suzanne , pretending to want to be winner of the patriotic prize , when all you really want is to make everybody in the settlement happy ! What will you do ? " " Sit on a stump and watch you go by . " Suzanne smiled up at him through her tears . " II think I would rather feel right , that way , than be patriotic-and selfish-dressed up . And since I 'm not going to be in the parade , wo n't you please tell me how you are to dress ? " Stephen shook his head . " You 'll have to wait and see , " he said . He was n't sure , but he believed he was , getting an idea . And because it was a surprise idea , he suddenly left Suzanne standing there and hurried home to his cabin . A little before dusk , when he knew the girl would be out helping her father with the milking , he stole over to her door yard and handed her mother a bulky bundle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make her wear it , " he explained quickly . When he reached home , he went straight to bed in the stuffy cabin-loft . He did n't want to talk to anyone . Especially he did n't want to answer questions . He was n't sure but what he might like to cry a little , though of course he was too big for that . He , too , had had hopes of winning a prize . Now he was not sure that he even wanted to march in the parade . It would not be patriotic to stay out , though . If everybody did that , there would n't be any parade . In this hard second year of the settlement , there were many who had not the time or the strength for costume-making . He guessed his old homespun would have to do . Finally he drifted off to sleep , in his ears the sound of sister Betsy 's low talking and William 's deep voice , planning for the next days festivities . Because he had gone to bed so early , Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chinks in the log wall were still gray . Stephen had to peep out of one of the chinks  --  there was no window-to make sure that it was not cloudiness he saw But all was clear , and far in the east a hint of rose color was deepening . Stephen sat up and glanced about him on the floor for his pepper-and-salt trousers . They were n't where he had left them . Neither was his coat . Probably his brother John , who shared the featherbed with him , had hidden them for a joke . He felt like pummeling his brother , but he was sleeping so soundly that Stephen had n't the heart . Besides , there was nothing Johnny enjoyed more than a pummeling and wrestling contest . Stephen finally decided that he would do better to hunt around and locate the clothes himself . Creeping softly out of bed and over the rough floor , he searched in all the dim corners , and lay on his stomach and peered through the trapdoor that led to the lower cabin room . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to crawl back into bed , when he caught sight of the familiar pepper-and-salt heap right by Johnny 's head . Stephen grinned . The little fellow had been too sleepy to get very far with them . He tiptoed over and started to draw on . the trousers . They would n't draw Something was wrong . Stephen felt of himself all over . Had he swelled in the night ? He tried again . Those trousers simply would n't go on . Neither would the short coat . He examined them more closely They had shrunk ! " Boys ! Time to get up ! " came his mother 's voice from below " Today 's the Fourth of July , and if we listen , we 'll hear the sunrise salute from Fort Harman in a few minutes . Johnny ! Betsy and I got Stephens suit all cut over for you , before we went to bed . And , Stephen  --  " He heard his mother 's footsteps fumbling on the ladder-like pegs that served for stairs . She did not often come up-but in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beaming and in her arms she carried a white bundle . " Here , son ! It 's a surprise we 've been working on , for you . There was just enough for pantaloons and a little blouse for Charlie , and for you-a whole outfit . Trousers and shirt ! See ! " Stephen could see . The linen from the flax that he himself had helped Father sow and pull and set to resting , that Luther and William had dressed and spun and woven ! It was not bleached quite snow-white , but if it had been any whiter Stephen believed he would have had to cry out in shame . As it was , with Mother passing them to him , so proud of her handiwork and Betsy's-well , he gulped hard , twice , and took them . " Thank you  --  oh , thank you ! " he said weakly . " Is n't it a surprise ? " " Oh , yes ! Yes , indeed , Mother ! It 's a-great surprise . " They will show off well in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Mother 's head vanished from the hole in the floor , leaving Stephen to ponder . The parade-he must wear that white girlish  --  looking outfit in the parade ! Oh , why had he taken his fine leather pioneering costume over to Suzanne last night ? It would n't be polite to ask for it back , now Besides , Mother and Betsy would be disappointed . They would n't understand . Johnny was already dressed and had scampered down the pegs to . strut about in his " new " home  --  spuns . For two years he had wanted them . Little Charlie was below , too , squealing with delight at what he felt to be his own beautiful appearance . Slowly Stephen donned the fresh linen . If he had n't himself worked so hard in that flax-patch and the retting-swamp , the linen would not yet be spun and he would have been spared the indignity of appearing in it on the biggest holiday of the whole year ! When he finally went below , Luther did not make fun of him . Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were too busy to make remarks . He wondered what the prize for the most patriotic costumes would be-not that it made any difference to him , now He drew in a deep breath . Just as they drew up their benches to the table for a breakfast of pork and mush , the earth trembled with a dull roar like thunder-the sunrise salute from the big cannon upriver at the Fort ! How he 'd like to be there , to see the soldiers set off the charge ! He tarried about his morning chores . One moment he was afraid the friendly pigs would nose mud onto his immaculate trousers , the next moment he almost wished they would , so he could stay home from the parade . Yet he did n't really want to stay home . He wanted to see if Suzanne wore his outfit , and wondered how she would look in it . At last they set off , with Luther ahead , carrying the lunch basket not much lunch , for this had been the famine  --  spring ; William carrying the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and finally the rest of the family The gathering place was on the cleared bottom land before Major Goodale 's house . Most of the settlement was there already . Stephen tried to keep out of sight , but that was fairly impossible . He felt that his raiment shone like a mirror , attracting the attention of all . He knew that a number of the ladies were whispering about him . " Ho ! Ho ! " teased Tommy James . " Did you make it out of one of Betsy 's bedgowns ? Nothing very patriotic about that . " " Ho ! Ho ! " Stephen answered . " Where 's that captain 's uniform you were going to wear ? " " Well-er , you see , Father had to wear that himself , " and Tommy retreated . Suzanne was nowhere about . Perhaps she had not liked his gift . Elijah Pixley struck up a tattoo , or rhythm , on his drum . The men were forming in line when two young , brown-coated , rosy-cheecked girls came dashing up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she came by the path to help me , and we only just got each other found ! " Suzanne explained breathlessly to Stephen , " Oh , but you were good to give me this ! " She fingered the fawn-skin garments , tossed back the bob of squirrel tail that decorated her light fur cap . " It is beautiful . " " You are-beautiful , " Stephen answered slowly-and gently . " I hope-the fawnskin is n't too warm . " It may be , before the march is over , but for now it 's just right , " she said , laughing , and ran on with Polly to take her place in line . Long leather leggings , soft jerkin trimmed with squirrel fur-his uniform that he had given to her , as he intended , just matched her own uniform that she had loaned Polly . It was patriotic because it showed how well the pioneer could clothe himself in the new land . Stephen watched the sturdy pair until he would have forgotten to march himself if Charlie had n't come and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's time for us to join in . I 'm to be your partner . I think we 'll look nice , all in white , do n't you ? " Stephen , looking down at the small eager face , knew that he must march very straight and very proudly indeed , if he was to be worthy of this little partner 's admiration . He did march straight , and as he threw his shoulders back he was suddenly aware that even this white , ladylike linen was another proof that the wilderness land could be made to support civilization . Food , shelter , and clothing there would be as long as there were hands ready and willing to plant and hew and sew . It was a long march down the rough stumpy forest-aisles , halfway to Jonathan Stone 's house , yet even little Charlie 's feet did not miss many beats of the marching thrum of Pixley 's drum . Then back they marched , past the group of ladies and judges who had stayed to gossip and decide about the costumes . Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they broke ranks , but he believed now that he would stay and enter the races and ball games with the other boys . He might look funny , but there was nothing to be ashamed of , in wearing linen . " Attention ! " called out Major Goodale . Everyone stopped whispering and stood very straight . " It is my pleasure first to announce the nature of the prize in this contest . In about half an hour , Griffin Greene is starting up-river to Fort Harman . The contest-winner is to accompany him and be given the privilege of hauling down the colors there at the time of the sunset salute this evening . " Stephen 's knees began to wobble . He tried-he tried hard not to care . But it seemed as though he would have given anything to be winner of a prize like that . Griffin Greene had so fine a canoe-and young Kitt , Waldo Putnam 's servant , would probably paddle alongside in his . River travel for a man alone was not yet quite safe from Indian attack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like this ! " For the most beautiful , most patriotic costuming we must award our prize to Miss Suzanne Oliver and Miss Polly Miles . They have shown what can be done with the rough forest materials . Mr. Greene says there 'll be room for both these winners in the canoe with him . And at the invitation of our friend Kitt , I am awarding still two other prizes , equal to the first . They are for costomes which give us still another view , a glimpse into the future . You will notice that Stephen and Charles Dana are attired in linen , Belpre-sown , Belpregrown , and , ahem , Belpre-sewn ! The flax was planted early this spring . The finished garment literally stands before you on this fourth day of July . Where in this wide world could one do better ? From the sturdy leather of the huntsman to the fine linens of the homemaker , this country can supply all needs . " Stephen , you and Charlie may also make the trip to the Fort , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the colors , perhaps you two can set the fuse for the sunset gun . " Stephen could hardly believe his ears . Already he was hearing the delightful splash of waters against the bow of Kitts canoe . Already he could feel throbbing in his ears , the fine patriotic thunder of the great fort-cannon . But it was only Charlie , whispering , " We did look nice , did n't we ? " Stephen nodded . " Everything looks nice today , " he agreed . <p>
