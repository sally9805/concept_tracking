<p>  --  Bob Huggins thought he would be done by now . One of the nation 's most controversial college basketball coaches , Huggins figured he would walk away from the coaching business by 51 , the age his father retired after an outstanding career in Ohio 's high school ranks . <p> But after leaving the urban concrete of Cincinnati 14 months ago following a forced resignation , Huggins , 53 , finds himself here among the rural countryside of basketball obscurity for one reason : <p> " I did not want to go out the way it ended , " said Huggins , sitting in a soft chair this week in his Kansas State office . <p> Of all the nation 's coaches who will open practice Friday night directing new programs , none will be as scrutinized as Huggins , whose success at Cincinnati , which included 14 NCAA tournament appearances and a Final Four appearance in 1992 , was offset by the perception that he ran a renegade program defined by player arrests , low graduation rates and his own missteps , notably a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " bad " and said some of his players did " stupid things . " But he defended the character of his players and criticized federal graduation rates for failing to show a complete picture . <p> " I hope I 'm smarter , but I always hope that every year , " Huggins said . " You learn . I think in some ways stepping back and looking from the outside in  --  on the inside everything goes so fast , but from the outside you get a little bit different perspective . I 'm smarter in the way I deal with players , people , the media , the way I deal with everybody . " <p> There is little doubt among those in basketball circles whether Huggins will win at Kansas State or whether his arrival will result in a significant economic boost for the program . The larger question is whether the hire was worth the risk to the university 's reputation . <p> Kansas State President Jon Wefald said Huggins has exceeded all expectations in his first seven months , but when asked whether there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wefald acknowledged , " I think the fair answer to that is probably . " <p> School administrators feel the risk is worth taking for a once-proud program that has reached four Final Fours , but none since 1964 . It has been 10 years since the Wildcats last played in the NCAA tournament and seven since they participated in the National Invitation Tournament . Tim Weiser , the athletic director , felt much of the fan base had begun to accept " moral victories , " which made finding the perfect replacement for fired coach Jim Wooldridge all the more important . <p> When Eddie Fogler , the former Vanderbilt and South Carolina coach who was a friend of both Weiser and Huggins , first suggested the possibility , Weiser was skeptical but considered it out of respect for Fogler 's opinion . Weiser and Huggins first met at an Indianapolis hotel , where Weiser said he asked Huggins " pointed , awkward questions I needed answers on . " While in Indianapolis , Weiser also met with Dave Didion , the NCAA 's director of enforcement , and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> The NCAA investigated Cincinnati in the late 1990s and cited the Bearcats for a lack of institutional control . Huggins was never found to have committed a major violation . <p> " The label Bob may have been given was unfounded , " Weiser said of the perception surrounding the Cincinnati program . " There was no evidence or feeling that Bob would cheat to win or condone cheating . " <p> Weiser 's next step was to bring Wefald and members of the search committee to Chicago to meet with Huggins at a hotel in what would be the definitive two-hour interview . Weiser was particularly interested in the interaction between Huggins and Wefald considering Cincinnati President Nancy Zimpher took exception with Huggins and chose not to roll over his contract . <p> " When Tim first told me he was in the mix , I thought , ' Oh , boy , ' " said Jim Epps , Kansas State 's senior associate athletic director and a member of the search committee . " Based on everything that has been written about Coach Huggins , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this little town of Manhattan , and in this conservative state of Kansas ? ' " <p> Wefald and Epps were curious to meet the man often portrayed as bombastic and domineering . They remember Huggins as neither . Instead , he was soft-spoken and contrite . Wefald and Epps left the meeting with no qualms about hiring Huggins to resuscitate their program . <p> In addition , Weiser got an endorsement from Texas Tech Coach Bob Knight and was satisfied with feedback he received from " a friend in the secret service , " someone Weiser uses to assist with background checks for all coaches he hires . " He probably made some mistakes with some of the players he brought in , " Wefald said of Huggins 's tenure at Cincinnati . " That 's not going to happen here . " <p> To the surprise of no one , including Wefald , the hire was not universally applauded . <p> In a column for the Associated Press that ran in papers throughout Kansas , Jim Litke wrote , " Huggins will bring some great players to Kansas State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose , and sometime down the road , that satellite NCAA office in Manhattan will be calling Wefald with questions . <p> " And anybody who did n't see it coming has no business running a grade school , let alone a university . " <p> Attracting top talent to the wind-swept plains of central Kansas is no easy task , but Huggins has shown no difficulties . During his time away from the game , Huggins seemed to continue to recruit , though he did n't have a school . He visited longtime friend J.O . Stright , who was with Huggins a few years ago when he suffered a heart attack and who runs a nationally renowned summer-league basketball program in the Pittsburgh area . He attended a game that featured Jason Bennett of Jacksonville , Fla. , a 7-foot-3 high school senior who had committed to Huggins at Cincinnati and who eventually followed the coach to Kansas State . <p> And Huggins also attended some games in the Cincinnati area that featured North College Hill , whose stars O.J. Mayo and Bill Walker were heavily considering playing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but recruiting analysts call it a stroke of genius . <p> " I went to watch North College Hill some because I like watching them play , " Huggins said . " It was n't anything more . They are fun to watch . " <p> After Huggins was hired at Kansas State , Mayo , a household name in basketball circles since middle school , continued to speak highly of the coach . Kansas State and Southern California were among the finalists for Mayo , who has yet to publicly announce his choice . Sources familiar with the situation , however , said Huggins has backed off because too many outside influences have become involved in Mayo 's recruitment . <p> Walker , however , could theoretically be in a Kansas State uniform for the spring semester , which would be a coup for the Wildcats . Walker , who is not allowed to play high school basketball this year because he has exhausted his eligibility , could gain college eligibility by graduating early and enrolling at Kansas State mid-semester . In addition , high school all-American Michael Beasley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be at Kansas State next fall . <p> The current players marvel at the transformation they have undergone since Huggins introduced himself by saying they were about to endure the toughest experience of their basketball lives . Huggins hired Scott Greenawalt , the former Cincinnati strength and conditioning coach , to work players into shape . Senior guard Akeem Wright said he has gained 10 pounds of muscle in the offseason while his body fat has dropped to 8.1 percent . Other players said Huggins is the toughest disciplinarian they have had as a coach . <p> Shortly after arriving , Huggins dismissed a reserve guard for disciplinary reasons and suspended the team 's best player , second-team all-Big 12 selection Cartier Martin , indefinitely because of undisclosed rule violations . Should a player miss a class , he will find himself on the football field , be it at 6 a.m. or a Friday night , flipping tractor-size tires . <p> " He 'll do it when you hate it , " junior forward David Hoskins said . <p> Players and administrators alike never anticipated the level of excitement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new challenges . For example , administrators were planning to convene in recent days to discuss safety issues involved with students who now want to camp out days before games . <p> Last season , Kansas State ranked ninth in the Big 12 in attendance , averaging 7,664 fans , including 6,400 season tickets , in a 13,340-seat arena . Since Huggins 's arrival , season ticket sales have more than doubled and 20 seats added on the floor sold quickly for $4,400 each . <p> " We had to find someone like Coach Huggins to come in here at this time , simply because of the fact we were n't filling this arena , " said Ernie Barrett , a Kansas State all-American who led the Wildcats to the 1951 national championship game . " If we brought in a second-tier coach , maybe a no-name nationally , we would probably have lost a lot more season-ticket holders . Now with Coach Huggins , it has done the opposite . " <p> Kansas State had been making futile attempts for years to secure a contract with Nike to outfit all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a longtime Nike endorser , Kansas State signed a $15.8 million eight-year contract with Nike to become one of only a dozen schools that has all of its uniforms paid for by the shoe company . During Friday night 's " Madness in Manhattan , " the Wildcats will unveil uniforms that Nike designed . <p> " He is a brand name , " said Bob Cavello , an associate athletic director in charge of business operations . " It 's been said that football is the engine that pulls the train . Now we have two locomotives . " <p> Huggins had never been to Manhattan before his introductory news conference . But he has made strides to embrace the community and culture . <p> During a swing through western Kansas , Huggins spoke at several booster club banquets , including one that was held in a large maintenance shed surrounded by dirt . Trucks were taken out , replaced by seats . Hundreds packed the shed . More seats had to be brought outside , along with speakers , for the overflow crowd . The menu : potato salad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gathering he planned to lead Kansas State to the Final Four , everyone roared . <p> When asked this week about a timetable for that goal , Huggins said only , " I 'm not very patient .
