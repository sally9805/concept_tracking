Worried about your credit information ? Congress made some major changes to the Fair Credit Reporting Act last month that should help assuage your fears . By the end of next year , consumers will be able to obtain one free credit report a year from each of the three credit bureaus  --  Equifax , Experian and TransUnion . Consumers will also be able to opt out of having financial firms share their personal data for marketing purposes . And creditors will have to tell consumers before reporting negative information to credit bureaus . Such provisions should help consumers control their credit information and stave off the rise in identity theft , which cost individuals $5 billion last year . Still , many consumer groups opposed the federal rewrite because it prevents states from enacting stronger consumer-protection laws of their own .  --  By Barbara Kiviat
