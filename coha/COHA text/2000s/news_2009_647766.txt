During his visit to Sudan last week , Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry ( D ) of Massachusetts visited the conflict-ridden region of Darfur , calling it a " humanitarian tragedy " that remains a " high priority . " <p> More than a month and a half after 13 major international aid agencies were expelled from Sudan for allegedly spying on the government , the situation on the ground is ever more grim in a region that was - before the expulsions - home to the world 's largest humanitarian aid effort . <p> Concerns about the humanitarian situation in the semi-arid western Darfur region - where 2.7 million people live in camps for the displaced - come amid increased insecurity for aid workers in the region and claims that rebel groups are uniting in preparation for " change . " <p> " The impact of the expulsions is already being felt across Darfur , but is likely to get even worse in the coming months , " wrote Alun McDonald , of the British arm of Oxfam International , in a blog posting last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world could get even worse . " <p> An ongoing conflict between government forces and rebels protesting Darfur 's marginalization has lasted six years , leaving up to 300,000 dead and driving almost 3 million others from their homes , according to United Nations estimates . <p> Aid groups kicked out <p> Darfur 's fate became even more uncertain after the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) last month issued an international arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the region . The expulsion of the nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) - including Oxfam , CARE International and Medecins Sans Frontieres , or Doctors Without Borders - came as a response to the ICC indictment . <p> While the government claims the humanitarian situation in Darfur is stable despite the expulsions , the UN insists humanitarian gaps left by the departure of the NGOs have not been filled . <p> In the span of one week in early April , 10 people , including two children , reportedly died of diarrhea in Zamzam camp in northern Darfur , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitivity of the information . <p> Latrines have collapsed , mechanized water pumps are running out of fuel , and in one case , pro-government militiamen stole the food rations of displaced people , the organization says . <p> In March , the expulsions left 5,000 malnourished children under five and pregnant and lactating women without supplementary food , according to the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , or OCHA . <p> Only about 30 percent of the 650,000 people that had lost healthcare coverage following the departure of the NGOs have received some form of assistance , OCHA says . <p> Displaced Darfuris now more vulnerable <p> The expulsions have also left the displaced , especially women and children , more vulnerable to attacks , according to US Agency for International Development , or USAID . Since March , aid workers have reported increased attacks targeting displaced people collecting firewood near their camps . <p> In some camps , residents have been refusing humanitarian aid , to protest the government 's expulsion of the NGOs . Leaders of one of the most volatile camps in Darfur , Kalma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-week deadlock , but resistance remains . <p> " They have made it clear that they do not want any national NGOs in the camp , because they believe that these NGOs are run by the government and it 's one way that the government wants to infiltrate the camp , " says Eddie Rowe , head of the World Food Programme in southern Darfur . <p> At least two of the expelled agencies - Oxfam and CARE - have formally appealed the government 's decision . During last week 's trip , Senator Kerry said Sudan had agreed to restore some of the aid in Darfur , adding that during his recent visit , US Special Envoy to Sudan Scott Gration negotiated " a strong agreement with the government with many positive elements to address the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Darfur " - a hint that some of the expelled NGOs may be allowed to return . But in public speeches , Mr. Bashir has consistently said the decision to kick them out is irreversible . <p> Even more dangerous for aid workers <p> Meanwhile , the atmosphere for aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expatriates in less than a month . Two female employees of Aide Medicale Interationale - one French and one Canadian - remain in captivity after being kidnapped April 5 by armed men . <p> In March , a Sudanese aid worker was shot dead in his home - a sign , according to his employer Mark Simmons , chair of the International NGO Forum in the capital Khartoum , that the current atmosphere in Sudan may have led people to believe they can attack NGOs with impunity . <p> UN statistics show that between March 1 and April 15 , assailants hijacked 18 humanitarian vehicles , abducted 10 humanitarian staff , and broke into 20 humanitarian premises . <p> In the first two weeks of April , the insecurity pushed five NGOs to temporarily relocate staff from Darfur , and of those , four closed or suspended operations in some parts of the region , USAID said . <p> The UN peacekeeping mission in Darfur has lost one peacekeeper and suffered several attacks and ambushes since the indictment . <p> Rebels uniting for more attacks ? <p> Rebels who had long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an indictment against Bashir have remained surprisingly quiet , but recent alliances among them suggest something may be in the works . <p> The most powerful rebel group , the Justice and Equality Movement ( JEM ) , has claimed several gains in recent weeks , including a switch by a leading commander and his 500 soldiers from a faction of the Sudan Liberation Army in the interest of " unity " ; new alliances with formerly pro-government tribes ; and " hundreds " of new recruits from the civilian camps . <p> " The government has to take that seriously , " warns Ahmed Hussain Adam , a JEM spokesperson . " The violence is going to increase soon . " <p> Analysts are skeptical that these mergers will have a big impact . <p> " Previous alliances between JEM and other rebel factions have been motivated by opportunism and turned out to be short-lived , " says Wolfam Lacher , a Sudan analyst at Control Risks Group , a business risk consultancy . <p> But JEM 's rebels last year made it all the way to the capital in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting on the streets . Mr. Hussain 's veiled threats of a coup match JEM 's repeated promises to capture Bashir and hand him over for trial at The Hague-based ICC . <p> " If there is no political horizon , JEM will be forced to act in different ways to achieve the aspirations of its people and to change the status quo and to change the operation of power , " Hussain says . " The situation is going to change . Believe me . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2009 .
