Sullivan : COMMENCEMENT <br> Part One <br> SMITH ALUMNAE QUARTERLY <br> Spring 2006 Class Notes <br> CLASS OF ' 02 <br> Robin Hughes graduates from Northwestern this May with a master 's in public health . She lives in Chicago with fellow Hopkins House alum Gretchen ( Gretch ) Anderson . . . Natalie Goldberg ( Emerson House ) and her partner Gina Black ( class of ' 99 ) have finally realized their dream of moving to Finland and opening a karaoke bar ! So far , they say , Emersonians Emma Bramley-Hawke and Joy Watkins have already stopped in for several verses of " Total Eclipse of the Heart " . . . After four years of working in a health clinic in her native Malaysia , Jia-Yi Moa has been accepted to NYU Medical School ! . . . And now , news from my own darling group of girls : Sally Werner , who works as a researcher in a medical lab at Harvard , is getting married ( on the Smith campus ! ) this May to longtime boyfriend Jake Brown . Fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , April Adams ( intrepid research assistant for Women in Peril , Inc. ) , and yours truly will be serving as bridesmaids . Look out for the embarrassing drunken photos in the next issue . Until then , happy spring to all and keep sending me those updates . <br> Your class secretary , <br> Celia **34;222;TOOLONG <br> Celia <br> Celia woke with a gasp . <br> Her head was throbbing , her throat was dry , and it was already nine o'clock . She was late for Sally 's wedding or , at least , for the bus that would take her there . She silently cursed herself for going out the night before . What the hell kind of a bridesmaid showed up late to the wedding of a dear friend , and hungover at that ? <br> Sun streamed through the windows of her little alcove studio . From her spot in bed , Celia could see two beer bottles and an open bag of tortilla chips on the coffee table by the couch , and , oh Jesus , there was a condom wrapper on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> The guy lying next to her was named either Brian or Ryan ; that much she remembered . Everything else was a bit of a blur . She vaguely recollected kissing him on the front stoop of her building , fumbling for the keys , his hand already moving up her leg and under her skirt . She did not recall having sex or , for that matter , eating tortilla chips . <br> She was lucky not to have been chopped up into little bits . Her sober self needed to somehow get the message to her drunk self that it was entirely unadvisable to bring strange men home . You saw it in the papers all the time  --  They met at a party , he asked her to go for a stroll , two days later the police found her torso in a dumpster in Queens . She wished that casual sex was n't so intimately connected to the possibility of being murdered , but there you had it . <br> Celia leaned toward him now and kissed his cheek , trying to affect an air of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said softly . " Do you want to hop in the shower ? " <br> He shook his head . " I do n't have to go into the office today , " he said . " Got a golf date with some clients this afternoon . Mind if I sleep in ? " <br> " Umm , no , " she said . " That 's fine . " <br> Celia looked him over . Blond hair , perfect skin , chiseled arms , dimples . He was cute , suspiciously cute . Too attractive for his own good , as her mother would say . <br> Before she left , she kissed him again . " The door will lock automatically behind you . And there 's coffee on the counter if you want it . " <br> " Thanks , " he said . " So I 'll call you ? " <br> " Good . Well , see you later , then . " <br> From his tone , she figured the odds of his actually calling were about fifty-fifty , not bad for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was it weird that he had asked to stay in her apartment ? Should she have demanded that he leave with her ? He looked clean-cut , and he said he worked in finance . He did n't seem like the type who would go home with a girl just to rob her , but what did she really know about him anyway ? Celia was twenty-six years old . Now into what she considered her late twenties , she had begun compiling a mental inventory of men she should not sleep with . As she stepped onto the A train , she added Guys who might be suspected of stealing my belongings to the list . <br> Twenty minutes later , she was sprinting through Port Authority , praying for the bus to be five minutes late . Just five extra minutes , that was all she needed . <br> " Hail Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with thee , blessed art thou amongst women , " she muttered . " Come on , come on . " <br> It was a habit of hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in God and would say a Hail Mary whenever she was in trouble . Celia realized now that what she had once thought of as prayers were in fact just wishes . She did n't expect the Virgin to actually do anything  --  even if she did exist , she probably would n't be in the business of controlling buses running express from Manhattan to Northampton , Mass . All the same , the familiar words calmed Celia down . She tried to use them sparingly so as not to offend the Mother of God , a woman she did n't believe in , but even so . <br> Her mother revered the Virgin Mary , saying the rosary in her car on the way to work each morning , keeping a statue of the Madonna in the front garden for years , until a Presbyterian family moved in across the street ( not wanting to offend them , she dug up the statue and put it out back ) . She believed that Mary had all the power , that Jesus was secondary to her , because he had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother was perhaps the only person on earth to perceive Catholicism as matriarchal . <br> She reached the gate just as the bus driver was collecting the last of the tickets and closing the door . <br> " Wait ! " she shouted . " Wait ! Please ! " <br> The driver looked up in sleepy-eyed surprise . She hoped he was n't as hungover as she was . <br> " Please ! I have to get on that bus ! " she said . <br> " Hurry up , then , " he said . " There 's one seat left . " <br> It was n't like Celia to draw attention to herself in public , but the thought of Sally 's disappointment if she had to call and say she was running late was just too much to bear . Besides , Celia had been looking forward to this weekend for months . She did not want to miss a moment with the girls . <br> She pushed through the aisle , past mothers bouncing crying babies on their laps , teenagers with their headphones blaring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters . Bringing new meaning to hell on wheels , that ought to be Greyhound 's slogan . She was desperate for more coffee and as much Advil as she could take without killing herself . <br> Despite the four-and-a-half-hour bus ride that lay ahead , Celia smiled . Soon she would be with them again  --  Sally , impeccable and impulsive , a twenty-five-year-old millionaire in a thrift-store wedding gown ; April , brave and opinionated , with that sometimes reckless air that worried them all ; and Bree , beautiful and bright eyed and mired in a doomed love affair  --  she was still Celia 's favorite , despite all the changes and distance between them . <br> Celia sat down beside a pimply teenager reading a comic book . She closed her eyes and breathed in deep . <br> Eight years earlier , on Orientation Day , Celia wept in the backseat of her father 's Lincoln Town Car all the way out to Smith . The family had to pull over in a Taco Bell parking lot so she could get herself together before meeting her housemates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Franklin King House , she was fixed with a big fake smile and half a tube of her sister 's Maybelline concealer . ( Celia had always prided herself on being a girl who did n't wear makeup , but she realized at that moment that she did in fact apply powder and mascara and eye shadow most mornings , she just never bought any of it herself . ) She held back tears for hours as they carried boxes upstairs and mingled with other new students and their families on the lawn of the science quad . Then , at last , it was time for the family to go , and there was an embarrassing , agonizing moment in which the four of them  --  Celia , Violet , and their parents  --  stood in a circle and embraced , everyone crying except for Violet , who was fifteen and eager to get back home in time to see her boyfriend 's ska band play at the Knights of Columbus Hall . ( The band was called For Christ 's Sake , and Celia 's mother thought they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the last word was pronounced with an emphasis on the e , like the Japanese wine . ) <br> After they left , Celia cried until she felt as hollow as a jack-o ' - lantern . College had snuck up on her , and unlike so many of her friends , who had been dying to leave home , Celia liked her life just fine as it was . She could n't imagine going to sleep at night without first creeping into her parents ' room , curling up with the dogs at the foot of their bed as her father watched Letterman and her mother read some trashy novel . She could n't picture herself sharing a bathroom with anyone but Violet  --  you could n't yell at a dorm mate for using up all the hot water the way you could your sister . You could n't squeeze your blackheads in front of the mirror , wrapped in a towel and dripping wet from a shower while she sat on the edge of the tub and clipped her toenails . <br> At Smith , Celia worried that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month 's worth of groceries for a family of five , her mother had given her a prayer card with a picture of the Virgin printed on the front and her great-grandmother 's golden wall cross . <br> " You know this is n't a convent , right ? " her father teased his wife . <br> After a lifetime of Catholic school , Celia considered herself an atheist , but she was still terrified to throw these things in the trash  --  it seemed like a surefire way to get struck by lightning . Instead , she shoved them in the back of her top drawer and covered them over with underwear and socks . <br> Celia pulled two bottles of vodka from her suitcase , where they lay wrapped in a Snoopy bath towel that she 'd had since she was eight . As she placed them in her mini-fridge , she realized with some delight that she did n't have to hide them from anyone . <br> She unpacked the rest of her clothes and filled the closet . The room was small , with plain white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nightstand , and a dingy little mirror with a faded Clinton/Gore ' 96 sticker stuck to the bottom . Having seen friends ' rooms at Holy Cross and BC , Celia knew that this one was cozy and clean by comparison . Smith had free cable TV in every room , and private phones for each student , and huge windows with thick sills you could sit on , reading for hours . Her parents were going into crazy debt so she could be here . ( " We 'll be paying the loans off until your kids are in college , " her father had said the previous spring , in one final attempt to make her go to a state school . ) She knew she ought to feel grateful . Still , Celia got a little hysterical , imagining living the next four years between these walls . <br> She tried to go as long as she could without calling her mother . She lasted three hours . <br> " I started to drive on the way back here so your father could rest his eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it to exit eighteen before I was crying so hard that I had to pull over and switch seats with Daddy . " <br> Celia laughed . " I miss you guys so much already . " <br> Just then , a girl appeared outside the open door to her room . She looked like a middle-aged man , with a huge beer gut hanging over her khakis and a small brown stain on her white T-shirt . Her hair was slicked back , and she held a clipboard in her hand . <br> Celia hoped she had n't heard her blubbering away to her mother like a five-year-old . <br> " I got ta go , " she said into the phone . <br> " Celia Donnelly ? " the girl said , looking down at her list . Her voice was deep and gravelly . " Pleased to meet you . I 'm your HP  --  that 's house president  --  Jenna the Monster Truck Collins . First-year meeting in the living room in five . " <br> Downstairs in the living room a few minutes later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celia took stock of the other new girls . There were fifteen of them in all , and they mostly looked like the girls she 'd known in high school . They wore jeans or cotton sundresses ; they had touches of lip gloss and mascara on their faces , and smooth , long hair . Then there were the girls leading the meeting : Jenna the Monster Truck ; two other seniors about her size , both named Lisa , both with cropped boy haircuts ; and a junior named Becky , who looked like she might be positively gorgeous if only she gave a damn about her appearance . Her shoulder-length hair lay flat , clumped with grease , and her face was so shiny that , for the first time ever , Celia envisioned herself taking a little witch hazel to a stranger 's skin . With the exception of Jenna , they all wore flannel pajamas . <br> Is this what she and the others would become ? Celia wondered . Did attending a women 's college make you relinquish all grooming products and embrace carbohydrates like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later she would learn that if you were n't careful , the answers to these questions were yes and yes . After one semester , about a quarter of the girls would be going crazy , filling out transfer applications to Wesleyan or Swarthmore or any coed school that would take them midway through the year . ) <br> Continues ...
