: <p> The first thing I noticed when I opened my apartment door was the woman standing there . She was young , late teens or early twenties , her clothing a conservative dark gray , her hair strikingly blonde . She was slender , nearly gaunt in fact , and her face , while pretty enough , was drawn and taut . The glitter of a silver necklace peeked out from her open collar , with a matching twinkle from a ring on her right- hand ring finger . <p> All that I noticed peripherally , though . My main attention was on the gun she was pointing at me . <p> " Easy , " I cautioned , my eyes flicking once around the room in case I 'd somehow arrived at the wrong apartment door and my key had somehow managed to open it anyway . But it was my furniture , all right : old and mismatched , with a thin layer of dust marking the fact that I had n't spent a lot of time here in the past year . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Come in , " she ordered . Her voice was cold , a really good match for her face . <p> Briefly , I considered trying to outrun her reflexes by ducking back outside into the hallway and making a dash for the stairs . But the self-rolling carrybags that had followed me from the elevator were still behind me , and I probably could n't get out without tripping over them . Besides , even if I could outrun her reflexes , I could n't outrun a 5mm thudwumper round from her gun . <p> Possibly my gun , actually . It was hard to tell one gun from another when all you could see was the view down the barrel , but that could very well be the Glock I kept holstered under the tea table she was standing beside . <p> She was still waiting . I took a couple of steps forward , bringing myself and my obedient luggage fully inside the room . Just to prove I knew the routine , I reached behind me and pushed the door closed . " Now what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who you are , " she said . <p> " I 'm Frank Compton , " I said . " I live here . " <p> " Prove it . " <p> Prove it so that she would put away the gun ? Or prove it to confirm that I was the guy she 'd come here to shoot ? I glanced around the room again , looking for some clue as to what was going on . <p> It was only then that I noticed that the layer of dust that should have been covering everything was not , in fact , actually there . I took a third , longer , look , this time spotting the fact that the stack of magazines and unanswered mail on the tea table had been subtly shifted since my last brief time at home . <p> Which suggested that the woman facing me had n't simply nipped in five minutes ahead of me , hoping I 'd show up and play skeet for her . She had , in fact , moved in . <p> " What , you 've been here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked , focusing on the woman again . <p> Her lips compressed briefly . " No , I have , " she conceded . " Mr. Compton , I need your help . " <p> I shook my head . " I never discuss business when there 's a gun pointed at me . " <p> Slowly , she lowered the weapon . It was my Glock , all right . <p> " My name 's Lorelei Beach , " she said . " My sister 's in trouble . " <p> " Sorry to hear that , " I said . " What does that have to do with me ? " <p> " She 's trapped on New Tigris , " she said . " I need your help to get her out . " <p> " How do you get trapped on New Tigris ? " I asked , walking over to the couch and sitting down . My carrybags followed , rolling to a halt by the corner of the tea table . <p> " I mean she ca n't get out , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some bad people trying to find her , and they 're watching the spaceport . " <p> And New Tigris had only one spaceport , or at least only one place where torchships were legal to land . " She owe them money ? " I asked . <p> " Of course not , " Lorelei said , a bit stiffly . <p> " Then why do they want her ? " <p> " They want to hurt her . " <p> " So call the cops , " I said . " How about putting that gun down before someone gets hurt ? " <p> " The police ca n't help us , " she said , some desperation creeping into her voice . The gun stayed where it was , hanging loosely at her side . " You 're the only one who can . " <p> " I 'm flattered , " I said . " I also do n't believe it . " <p> " It 's the truth , " she insisted . " Why else would I have waited for you this way ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Her cheeks reddened a little . " It was the only place I felt safe . " <p> " Especially since most New York hotels do n't stock guns for their guests ? " <p> She lifted the Glock as if she 'd only just remembered she was holding it . " They 're after me , too , " she said in a low voice . <p> " I 'm sorry to hear that , " I said . " Feel free to call the cops on your way out . " <p> " If they catch me out there , they 'll kill me , " she said . <p> " Oh , come on , Ms. Beach , " I growled . " Really . You think I have n't heard that one before ? It 's the last card everyone tries when they want to con someone into doing something . " <p> " I 'm not trying to con you into anything , " she insisted . <p> " Could have fooled me , " I said . " There 's an emergency women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and tell them your troubles . Maybe they 'll put you up for the night . Maybe they 'll even talk to the cops for you . " <p> " The shelter ca n't help me , " she said . " Neither can the police . " <p> " You wo n't know until you try , will you ? " <p> She took a deep breath . " She should still be in the Zumurrud District of Imani City , " she said . " She 'll wait for you to contact her . Her name's- " <p> " Ms. Beach , I already told you I 'm not interested , " I interrupted , standing up again . " Furthermore , it 's been a long day and I 'm very tired . " <p> " Her name 's Rebekah , " she went on , the words coming out in a rush like a countdown sprinter trying to beat the clock . " She 's ten years old , blonde- " <p> " Ms. Beach , do I need to call the cops ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finally moving toward the door . " Would you at least think about it ? " <p> " Sorry , but I 'm otherwise employed at the moment , " I said . " You would n't believe how complicated my life is these days . " <p> Her lips twitched . " Actually , I would , " she said . " Good night , Mr. Compton . If you change your mind- " <p> " Good night , Ms. Beach , " I said . " Just leave the gun on the side table by the door . " <p> She hesitated . Then , turning her back on me , she set the Glock carefully onto the table . She turned back , her eyes searching my face , made as if to say something else , then nodded silently and left . <p> For a long time I just sat there , too tired even to get up and double- lock the door . I 'd been run through the wringer over the past few weeks , getting chased across half the Twelve Empires by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the galaxy and everyone in it . <p> This most recent skirmish , over an obscure set of Nemuti sculptures , had ended more or less all right , though I was starting to realize that victories against the Modhri were seldom really clear- cut . Still , one could only do what one could do . <p> Especially given the somewhat pathetic state of our side of this undeclared war . About all that stood between the Modhri and his dream of galactic conquest were the seven- legged Spiders who controlled the Quadrail system linking the galaxy 's inhabited worlds . Assisting the Spiders from the shadows were the remnants of the Chahwyn , a secretive race who had genetically engineered the Spiders into existence in the first place over a thousand years ago . The rest of the opposition consisted of a few stray individuals like me who had wandered or blundered onto the battlefield . <p> And neither the Spiders nor the Chahwyn could fight . <p> My half- glazed eyes drifted to the Glock on the table , and I felt a belated twinge of conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also had a backup Heckler- Koch 5mm hidden beneath my bed . And if the young lady was really in danger . . . <p> Impatiently , I shook the guilt away . If she was in danger , she needed to call the cops . That was what they were there for . <p> Collecting together my last waning bits of energy , I got up and double- locked the door . I turned to the table and reached for the Glock . <p> And paused . Sitting on the table alongside the gun , nestled between its frame and trigger guard , was the ring she 'd been wearing . <p> I picked it up and took a closer look . It was a silver band , with no stones or other additions . The design was simple , but had a certain elegance to it . It was also clearly handmade . <p> And the fact that she 'd left it behind probably meant she intended to return . <p> Wonderful . <p> Dropping the ring in my pocket , I returned the Glock to its hidden holster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they were , I staggered off to bed . Ten hours of sleep , and I might finally feel Human again . <p> I did n't get ten hours of sleep . I got exactly four hours before the sound of my door chime dragged me awake again . <p> I pried my eyes open and focused on the bedside clock . Three- fifteen in the morning . Even teenage clubbers had called it a night by now . <p> The chime came again . Fumbling for my robe , I worked into it with one hand while reaching under my bed for the Heckler- Koch with the other . There were very few people who paid social visits at three in the morning , and most of the ones who would be interested in my door were n't the type I wanted to meet unarmed . <p> The Heckler- Koch 's holster was empty . Apparently , I had n't sent Lorelei into the wilds of New York unarmed after all . <p> The door chimed again . Padding my way silently to the front room , I retrieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the door . " Who is it ? " I called . <p> " Frank Compton ? " a voice called back . <p> " Who is it ? " I repeated . <p> " Police , sir , " he called back . " Would you open up , please ? " <p> I keyed the viewer . There were two men in uniform out there , all right , one of them pressing an authentic- looking NYPD ID against the plate . Dropping the Glock into my robe pocket , I keyed open the door . " I 'm Officer Bagler , sir , " the cop said , holding up a reader as he compared my face to the picture on my official government record . " Would you get dressed , please ? We need you to come with us . " <p> " What 's the problem ? " I asked , not moving . <p> " There 's been a disturbance , sir , " he said in that official give- nothing- away voice I 'd often used myself during my years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you . " <p> " Then Detective Kylowski can come here , " I said . <p> " Please do n't make me insist , sir , " Bagler said . His eyes flicked to my sagging pocket . " Just leave the weapon here , of course . " <p> " Can you at least give me a hint ? " I asked . <p> He sighed silently . " A handgun registered to you has been involved in a murder , sir , " he said . " Now , will you please get dressed ? " <p> They took me to West Seventy- fifth Street and the familiar blazing lights and yellow tape of a crime scene . A dozen more cops were already on the scene , the uniformed ones guarding the perimeter and directing traffic , the plainclothes contingent milling around in the cold November air , collecting evidence or scanning for clues . <p> In the center of the stage were the guests of honor : one male , one female . Their torsos were covered by preservation cloths , but I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Lorelei had said she was in danger . I 'd been too tired to care . <p> A middle- aged man with receding hair and a serious seven- o'clock shadow stepped in front of me . " Compton ? " he asked . <p> I pulled my eyes away from Lorelei 's body . " Yes , " I said . <p> " Detective Kylowski , " he identified himself , holding out an ID badge . " Sorry to drag you down here at this time of night . " <p> Sure he was . " What happened ? " <p> " I was hoping you could tell me , " he said . " Neither vic has any ID , and we have n't been able to track them down . " <p> " The woman came to my apartment to night , " I told him , deciding to skip over the fact that she 'd already been there when I 'd arrived . " She said she was in trouble and asked for help . " <p> " And you said . . . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or try the women 's shelter and sent her on her way . " <p> " After giving her one of your guns ? " <p> " I did n't give her anything , " I said . " Obviously , she helped herself . " <p> " Without you noticing ? " <p> " I was very tired , " I said . " I still am . " <p> " Uh- huh , " he said , looking closely at me . " And you 're sure this is the same woman ? " <p> " I recognize her clothing , " I told him . " I doubt there are two women dressed that way who 've had access to my apartment lately . " <p> " Do n't you think you should at least take a look at her face ? " he persisted , gesturing me toward the bodies . " It 'll only take a minute . " <p> " If you insist , " I said , frowning as I walked over with him . Usually homicide cops were n't so eager to foist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " This might shock you a little , " he warned as he crouched down , his fingers getting a grip on the edge of the preservation cloth , his eyes locked unblinkingly on my face . <p> " Thanks for the warning , " I growled . Did he think the sight of a couple of dead bodies was going to shock an ex-Westali agent ? " Go ahead . " <p> He flipped over the cloth . <p> And I nearly lost my dinner . <p> Lorelei 's face above and in front of her ear was blood- spattered but mostly intact . Her head and neck below the ear , in contrast , were effectively gone , shattered into a mess of blood and shattered bone and pulp . <p> I twisted my face away from the sight , keeping my stomach under control by sheer force of will . I was still standing there , staring at a storm- sewer grating , when Kylowski took my arm and steered me away . " You all right ? " he asked . <p> " How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Turning my face away from him , I smiled hard , an old trick I 'd learned for suppressing the gag reflex . <p> " I understand , " he said . " Come on-have a seat over here . " <p> I let him sit me down on the curb . " I do n't suppose you have any idea why anyone would want to do something like that , " he went on , sitting down beside me . <p> I shook my head . My stomach was starting to recover , but my brain was still reeling with the shock of the mutilation . " Looks like a ritual murder . " <p> " Yeah , that was my first thought , too , " Kylowski said . " Trouble is , we do n't have any of the other usual trappings . No robes , no weird jewelry or tattoos , no strangled chickens . Not to mention that they were killed and mutilated here on the street and not in some abandoned ware house or tenement . " <p> " Maybe it 's a new- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the haze of nausea . " They were mutilated ? " <p> " That 's right , " he confirmed . He was back to scrutinizing my face . " Both of them were done the same way . " <p> I hauled myself to my feet , my stomach suddenly forgotten . One mutilation was a sick perversion . Two mutilations was a potentially intriguing pattern . " Let me see , " I said . <p> We retraced our steps to the bodies . Kylowski crouched down beside the man and twitched aside the cloth . <p> His head behind the ear was a copy of the mess that was now Lorelei 's , with the lower part of the skull torn to shreds . But there was one vital difference between his upper face and Lorelei 's : right in the middle of his forehead was another thudwumper hole . " Which of them was shot with my gun ? " I asked Kylowski . <p> " Funny you should ask , " Kylowski said . " Both of them . " <p> I frowned at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can tell , " he confirmed . " Kind of a puzzle , is n't it ? " <p> I stepped back over to Lorelei 's body and lifted the cloth , searching her torso . This time I spotted what I 'd missed on the first go- around : two small wet spots where blood had oozed rather than flowed . <p> The marks of snoozer rounds . " So much for your big puzzle , " I said , pointing to them . " This guy and at least one friend got the drop on Lorelei and got in the first shot . Once she was out , they took her gun and did all this . " <p> " The vic 's friend did this to him ? " Kylowski asked , gesturing to the dead man . " That 's one hell of a friend . " <p> " Yes , " I murmured , staring at the man 's mutilated head as it suddenly made sense . The plane of destruction torn by the thudwumper rounds had sliced right across the lower part of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed a Modhran colony would have been located . <p> The men who had assaulted and killed Lorelei were walkers . <p> I looked at the man 's closed eyes , a shiver running through me . One of the creepiest aspects of the Modhri group mind was the way it could infiltrate other living beings , Humans and Halkas and Bellidos , setting up small , sentient colonies within their bodies that could telepathically link with other nearby colonies to form a larger and smarter mind segment . <p> The puppetmaster scenario was bad enough . What made it worse was the fact that the walkers themselves were completely unaware that they 'd been drafted into the Modhri 's little war of conquest . Most of the time a polyp colony lay quietly , controlling its host with subtle mental suggestions that the host would usually obey , coming up with the most bizarrely convoluted rationalizations afterward for his or her behavior . Under more extreme conditions , though , the colony could push the host 's own mind and consciousness aside and take direct control of the body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as extensively as he had most of the other governments and cultures around us , but I knew he had a few walkers down here keeping an eye on things . It was a good bet that Lorelei had somehow wandered into his sights and been eliminated . <p> But why ? The Modhri did n't kill just for the sick fun of it . Had Lorelei known something the Modhri did n't want getting out ? Had she been another Spider agent like me , someone the Spiders had neglected to tell me about ? <p> Or was it something to do with her sister ? The sister on New Tigris , the girl Lorelei had said bad people were trying to find ? <p> " Well ? " Kylowski prompted . <p> " Well what ? " I countered , stalling for time while I tried to think . To me , what had happened here was now obvious . Lorelei had shot and killed the first walker , but had been nailed with snoozers before she could take out his companion . The Modhri , rightly guessing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the second walker obliterate the dead man 's polyp colony , lest an autopsy discover it . He 'd then created the same damage to Lorelei 's head to make it look like ritual murder or a psycho killer . <p> But knowing the truth was one thing . Talking about it was something else . The galaxy at large was unaware of the Modhri 's existence , let alone his plans and ambitions and techniques , and for the moment those of us in the know wanted to keep it that way . " Okay , so maybe friend was too strong a word , " I added . " Either way , there was a third person on the scene . " <p> " Obviously , " Kylowski said . " That still leaves us with the question of why he took the time to do all this . Especially since multiple thudwumper shots draw a lot more attention than just one or two . " <p> " I ca n't answer that , " I said , which was perfectly true if slightly misleading . " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns with thudwumpers ? " <p> " I load them with snoozers , like my permit specifies , " I said . " It does n't take a criminal mastermind to change clips . " <p> " Assuming he or she can find a supply of thudwumpers for that new clip . " <p> " Finding thudwumper rounds does n't take a criminal mastermind , either , " I said . " I presume some other gun fired the snoozers into Ms. Beach ? " <p> " Small- caliber Colt , " Kylowski confirmed . " So her name was Lorelei Beach ? " <p> " That 's the name she gave me , anyway , " I said . " By the way , did any of your people remove anything from either body ? " <p> " No , " Kylowski said . " Why , is something missing ? " <p> " She had a silver necklace when she was at my apartment , " I said . " It 's not there now . " <p> He made a note on his reader . " Why was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running a quick edit on the brief conversation Lorelei and I had had . The fact that her attackers had been walkers changed everything . " Like I said , she told me she was in danger and wanted my help , " I said . " That 's all . " <p> " And instead of helping you sent her out . " He nodded back toward her body . " Into this . " <p> " If I 'd known this would happen , I would n't have done that , " I said stiffly . <p> " Obviously , " he said . " Any idea what she might have been doing this far from your place ? " <p> I shook my head . " None . " <p> " Heading for Central Park , maybe ? " he persisted . " Or to see some friend who lived uptown ? " <p> " I said I do n't know . " <p> He pursed his lips . " Okay . What did you do after she left ? " <p> " I double-locked the door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove that ? " <p> I grimaced . Here was where it was going to hit the fan . " Not unless we had a cat burglar working the neighborhood who looked in my window . " <p> " Yeah , " Kylowski rumbled . " See , here 's my problem . Four problems , actually . First , by your own admission you met with one of the vics a few hours before her death . Second , you have no alibi for the time of the murder . " <p> " You must be joking , " I said . " Cops and vampires aside , precious few people have alibis for this hour of the morning . " <p> " True enough . " Kylowski raised his eyebrows . " Problem number three is that the murder weapon has n't been recovered . " <p> I frowned . " I thought you said it was my gun . " <p> " Oh , it was , " he assured me . " We were able to do a micro-groove analysis on a couple of the slugs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I know it , " I said . " So what would be my reason for taking the gun away ? " <p> " Because you also know that the chances of recovering a slug in good enough shape for a positive groove ID are pretty small , " he said . " The point is that in my experience there 's only one reason why a murderer risks getting caught with the murder weapon on him . Namely , if he knows it can be traced to him . " <p> " I already told you Ms. Beach stole it . " <p> " Did you report the theft ? " <p> " I did n't know it was gone until your buddies came knocking on my door an hour ago . " <p> " Uh- huh , " he said . " And that brings us to problem number four . The witness who called it in also reported a man of your general height and build running from the scene . " <p> I sighed . " Is there any point mentioning how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Not really , " Kylowski said . Half turning , he gestured to a pair of nearby uniforms . " Frank Compton , you 're under arrest . For murder . " <p> Excerpted from Odd Girl Out by Timothy Zahn Copyright 2005 by Timothy Zahn Published in November 2008 by Tom Doherty
