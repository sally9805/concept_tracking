Her name was Emily Anne . She was nine years old , with black ringlets , long lashes , and caramel-colored skin . Her ears were pierced with tiny gold loops . Her forehead was pierced by two slugs from a Cobra 9-mm semiautomatic . It was a Saturday , and I was working by special request of my boss , Pierre LaManche . I 'd been at the lab for four hours , sorting badly mangled tissue , when the door to the large autopsy room opened and Sergeant-Detective Luc Claudel came striding in . Claudel and I had worked together in the past , and though he 'd come to tolerate , perhaps even appreciate me , one would not infer that from his brusque manner . " Where 's LaManche ? " he demanded , glancing at the gurney in front of me , then quickly away . I said nothing . When Claudel was in one of his moods , I ignored him . " Has Dr. LaManche arrived ? " The detective avoided looking at my greasy gloves . " It 's Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that moment Michel Charbonneau stuck his head into the room . Through the opening I could hear the whir and clank of the electric door at the back of the building . " Le cadavre est arriv , " Charbonneau told his partner . What cadaver ? Why were two homicide detectives at the morgue on a Saturday afternoon ? Charbonneau greeted me in English . He was a large man , with spiky hair that resembled a hedgehog 's . " Hey , Doc . " " What 's going on ? " I asked , pulling off my gloves and lowering my mask . Claudel answered , his face tense , his eyes cheerless in the harsh fluorescent light . " Dr. LaManche will be here shortly . He can explain . " Already sweat glistened on his forehead , and his mouth was compressed into a thin , tight line . Claudel detested autopsies and avoided the morgue as much as possible . Without another word he pulled the door wide and brushed past his partner . Charbonneau watched him walk down the corridor , then turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has kids . " " Kids ? " I felt something cold in my chest . " The Heathens struck this morning . Ever hear of Richard Marcotte ? " The name was vaguely familiar . " Maybe you know him as Araigne . Spider . " He curled his fingers like a child doing the waterspout rhyme . " Great guy . And an elected official in the outlaw biker set . Spider is the Vipers sergeant at arms , but he had a real bad day today . When he set out for the gym around eight this morning the Heathens blasted him in a drive-by while his ole lady dove for cover in a lilac bush . " Charbonneau ran a hand backward through his hair , swallowed . I waited . " In the process they also killed a child . " " Oh , God . " My fingers tightened around the gloves . " A little girl . They took her to the Montral Children 's Hospital , but she did n't make it . They 're bringing her here now . Marcotte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LaManche is coming in ? " Charbonneau nodded . The five pathologists at the lab take turns being on call . Rarely does it happen , but if an off-hours autopsy or visit to a death scene is deemed necessary , someone is always available . Today that was LaManche . A child . I could feel the familiar surge of emotions and needed to get away . My watch said twelve-forty . I tore off my plastic apron , balled it together with the mask and latex gloves , and threw everything into a biological waste container . Then I washed my hands and rode the elevator to the twelfth floor . I do n't know how long I sat in my office , staring at the St. Lawrence and ignoring my carton of yogurt . At one point I thought I heard LaManche 's door , then the swish of the glass security doors that separate portions of our wing . Being a forensic anthropologist , I 've developed some immunity to violent death . Since the medical examiner turns to me to derive information from the bones of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the worst . My workplaces are the morgue and autopsy room , so I know how a corpse looks and smells , how it feels when handled or cut with a scalpel . I 'm accustomed to bloody clothing drying on racks , to the sound of a Stryker saw cutting through bone , to the sight of organs floating in numbered specimen jars . But I have always been unsettled by the sight of dead children . The shaken baby , the battered toddler , the emaciated child of religious zealots , the preteen victim of a violent pedophile . The violation of young innocents has never failed to agitate and distress me . Not long ago I had worked a case involving infants , twin boys killed and mutilated . It had been one of the most difficult encounters of my career , and I did n't want to reboard that emotional merry-go-round . Then again that case had been a source of satisfaction . When the fanatic responsible was locked up and could order no more executions , I felt a genuine sense of having accomplished something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yogurt . Images of those babies hovered in my mind . I remembered my feelings in the morgue that day , the flashbacks to my infant daughter . Dear God , why such insanity ? The mutilated men I had left downstairs had also died as a result of the current biker war . Do n't get despondent , Brennan . Get angry . Get coldly , resolutely angry . Then apply your science to help nail the bastards . " Yep , " I agreed with myself aloud . I finished the yogurt , drained my drink , and headed downstairs . Charbonneau was in the anteroom of one of the small autopsy suites , flipping pages in a spiral notebook . His large frame overflowed a vinyl chair opposite the desk . Claudel was nowhere to be seen . " What 's her name ? " I asked . " Emily Anne Toussaint . She was on her way to dance class . " " Where ? " " Verdun . " He tipped his head toward the adjoining room . " LaManche has begun the post . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A photographer was taking pictures while the pathologist made notes and shot Polaroid backups . I watched LaManche grasp a camera by its side handles , then raise and lower it above the body . As the lens moved in and out of focus a small dot blurred then condensed over one of the wounds in the child 's forehead . When the perimeter of the dot grew sharp , LaManche depressed the shutter release . A white square slid out and he pulled it free and added it to a collection on the side counter . Emily Anne 's body bore evidence of the intensive effort to save her life . Her head was partly bandaged , but I could see a clear tube protruding from her scalp , inserted to monitor intracranial pressure . An endotracheal tube ran down her throat and into her trachea and esophagus , placed in order to oxygenate the lungs and to block regurgitation from the stomach . Catheters for IV infusion remained in her subclavian , inguinal , and femoral vessels , and the circular white patches for EKG electrodes were still pasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an assault . I closed my eyes and felt tears burn the backs of my lids . I dragged my eyes back to the small body . Emily Anne wore nothing but a plastic hospital bracelet . Next to her lay a pale green hospital gown , bundled clothing , a pink backpack , and a pair of high-top red sneakers . The harsh fluorescent light . The shining steel and tile . The cold , sterile surgical instruments . A little girl did not belong here . When I looked up , LaManche 's sad eyes met mine . Though neither of us made reference to what lay on the stainless steel , I knew his thoughts . Another child . Another autopsy in this same room . Putting a choke hold on my emotions , I described the progress I was making with my own cases , reassembling the corpses of two bikers who 'd been blown apart by their own folly , and asked when antemortem medical records would be available . LaManche told me that the files had been requested and should arrive on Monday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task . As I sorted tissue , I remembered my previous day 's conversation with LaManche , and wished I were still in the Virginia woods . Was it only yesterday LaManche had called me there ? Emily Anne was alive then . So much can change in twenty-four hours .
