The Faraday boy had been missing for three days . <p> On the first day , nothing was done . After all , he was twenty-one , and young men of that age no longer had to abide by curfews and parental rules . Still , his behavior was out of character for him . Bobby Faraday was trustworthy . He was a graduate student , although he had taken a year off before deciding on the direction of his graduate studies in engineering , with talk of going abroad for a couple of months , or working for his uncle in San Diego . Instead , he had stayed in his hometown , saving money by living with his parents and banking as much of what he earned as he could , which was a little less than the previous year as he could now drink with impunity , and was maybe indulging that newfound liberty with more enthusiasm than might have been considered entirely wise . He 'd had a couple of killer hangovers over New Year 's , that was for sure , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liver started crying out for mercy , but Bobby was young , he was immortal , and he was in love , or had been until recently . Perhaps it would be truer to say that Bobby Faraday was still in love , but the object of his affection had moved on , leaving Bobby mired in his own emotions . The girl was why he had opted to remain in town instead of seeing a little more of the world , a decision that had been met with mixed feelings by his parents : gratitude on the part of his mother , disappointment on that of his father . There had been some arguments about it at the start , but now , as with two reluctant armies on the verge of an unwanted battle , a truce of kinds had been declared between father and son , although each side continued to watch the other warily to see which one might blink first . Meanwhile , Bobby drank , and his father fumed , but remained silent in the hope that the ending of the relationship might lead his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall . <p> Despite his occasional overindulgences , Bobby was never late for work at the auto shop and gas station , and usually left a little later than he had to , because there was always something to be done , some task that he did not wish to abandon uncompleted , even if it could be finished quickly and easily in the morning . It was one of the reasons his father , whatever their disagreements , did n't worry too much about his son 's future prospects : Bobby was too conscientious to leave the beaten track for long . He liked order , and always had . He 'd never been one of those messy teenagers , either in appearance or in approach . It just was n't in his nature . <p> But he had n't come home the night before , and he had n't called to tell his parents where he might be , and that in itself was unusual . Then he did n't make it to work the following morning , which was so out of character that Ron Nevill , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check on the boy and make sure that he was n't ailing . His mother expressed surprise that her son was n't already at work . She 'd simply assumed that he 'd come home late and left early . She checked his bedroom , which lay just off the basement den . His bed had not been slept in , and there was no indication that he 'd spent the night on the couch instead . <p> When there was no word by 3 p.m. , she called her husband at work . Together they checked with Bobby 's friends , casual acquaintances , and his ex-girlfriend , Emily Kindler . That last call had been delicate , as she and Bobby had broken up only a couple of weeks before . His father suspected that this was the reason his son was drinking more than he should have , but he would n't have been the first man who tried to drown love 's sorrows in a batch of alcohol . The trouble was that frustrated love was buoyant in booze : the more you tried to force it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right back up to the top . <p> Nobody had heard from Bobby , or had seen him , since the previous day . When 7 p.m. came and went , they called the police . The chief was skeptical . He was new in town , but familiar with the ways of young people . Nevertheless , he accepted that this was not typical behavior for Bobby Faraday , and that twenty-four hours had now gone by since he left the gas station , for Bobby had not hit any of the local bars after work , and Ron Nevill seemed to be the last person to have seen him . The chief put together a description of the boy at the Faraday house , borrowed a photograph that had been taken the previous summer , and informed local law enforcement and the state police of a possible missing person . None of the other agencies responded with any great urgency , for they were almost as cynical about the behavior of young males as the chief was , and in the case of one going missing , they tended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more to the disappearance than a simple case of booze , hormones , or domestic difficulties . <p> On the second day , his parents , and their friends , began an informal canvass of the town and its environs , with no result . When it began to grow dark , his mother and father returned home , but they did not sleep that night , just as they had not slept the night before . His mother lay in bed , her face turned toward the window , straining to hear the sound of approaching footsteps , the familiar tread of her only son returning to her at last . She stirred only slightly when she heard her husband rise and put on his robe . <p> " What is it ? " she asked . <p> " Nothing , " he said . " I 'm going to make some tea , sit up for a while . " He paused . " You want some ? " <p> But she knew that he was asking only out of politeness , that he would prefer it if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to sit at the kitchen table in silence , together but apart , the fears of one feeding those of the other . He wanted to be alone . So she let him go , and when the bedroom door closed behind him , she began to cry . <p> On the third day , the formal search began . <p> The golden host moved as one , countless shapes bending obediently in unison at the gentle touch of the late-winter breeze , like a congregation at church bowing in accordance with the progress of the service , awaiting the moment of consecration that is to come . <p> They whispered to themselves , a soft , low susurrus that might have been the crashing of distant waves were such an alien noise not unknown in this landlocked place . The paleness of them was dappled in spots by small flowers of red and orange and blue , a scattering of petals upon an ocean of seed and stem . <p> The host had been spared the reaping , and had grown tall , too tall , even as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste , for the old man upon whose land the host was gathered had died the previous summer , and his relatives were fighting over the sale of the property and how the proceeds would be divided . While they fought , the host had stretched skyward , a sea of dull gold in the depths of winter , speaking in hushed tones of what lay , rush hemmed and undiscovered , nearby . <p> And yet the host , it seemed , was at peace . <p> Suddenly , the breeze dropped for an instant and the host stood erect , as though troubled by the change , sensing that all was not as it had been , and then the wind rose again , more tempestuous now , transforming into smaller , dispersed gusts that divided the host with ripples and eddies , their caresses less delicate than what had gone before . Unity was replaced by confusion . Scattered fragments were caught in the sunlight before they fell to the ground . The whispering grew louder , drowning the calling of a solitary bird with rumors of approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a great insect hovering over the stalks . It grew in stature , becoming the head , shoulders , and body of a man , passing between the rows of wheat while , ahead of him , a smaller form cleaved invisibly through the stalks , sniffing and yelping as it went , the first intruders upon the host 's territory since the old man had died . <p> A second figure came into view , heavier than the first . This one seemed to be struggling with the terrain and with the unaccustomed exercise that his participation in the search had forced upon him . In the distance , but farther to the east , the two men could see other searchers . Somehow , they had drifted away from the main pack , although that itself had diminished as the day wore on . Already the light was fading . Soon it would be time to call a halt , and there would be fewer of them to search in the days that followed . <p> They had begun that morning , immediately after Sunday services . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , since that had the largest yard and , curiously , the smallest congregation , a contradiction that Peyton Carmichael , the man with the dog , had never quite understood . Perhaps , he figured , they were expecting a mass conversion at some point in the future , which made him wonder if Catholics were just more optimistic than other folks . <p> The chief of police and his men had divided the township into grids , and the townspeople themselves into groups , and had assigned each group an area to search . Sandwiches , potato chips , and sodas in brown bags had been provided by the various churches , although most people had brought food and water of their own , just in case . In a break with Sunday tradition , none had dressed up in the usual finery . Instead , they wore loose shirts and old pants , and battered boots or comfortable sneakers . Some carried sticks , others garden rakes to search in the undergrowth . There was an air of subdued expectation , a kind of excitement despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to their assigned areas . As each area was searched , and nothing found , another was suggested either by the cops who were coordinating the efforts on the ground , or by contacting the base of operations that had been set up in the hall behind the church . <p> It had been unseasonably warm when they began , a curious false thaw that would soon end , and the difficulty of coping with soft ground and melting snow had sapped the strength of many before they took a break for lunch at about one or one thirty . Some of the older people had returned home at that stage , content to have made some effort for the Faradays , but the rest continued with the search . After all , the next day was Monday . There would be work to do , obligations to be met . This day was the only one that they could spare to look for the boy , and the best would have to be made of it . But as the light had grown dim , so too the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not left his Timberland jacket in the car but had chosen to tie it around his waist until it was needed . <p> He whistled at his dog , a three-year-old spaniel named Molly , and waited , once again , for his companion to catch up . Artie Hoyt : of all the people with whom he had to end up . Relations between the two men had been cool for the last year or more , ever since Artie had caught Peyton eyeing his daughter 's ass at church . It did n't matter to Artie that he had n't seen exactly what he thought he 'd seen . Yes , Peyton had been looking at his daughter 's ass , but not out of any feelings of lust or attraction . Not that he was above such base impulses : at times , the pastor 's sermons were so dull that the only thing keeping Peyton awake was the sight of young , lithe female forms draped in their Sunday best . Peyton was long past the age when he might have been troubled by the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church . He figured that God had better things to worry about than whether Peyton Carmichael , sixty-four , widower , was paying more attention to objects of female beauty than less Christian charity than the average alligator . As Peyton 's doctor liked to tell him , live a life of wine , women , and song , all in moderation but always of the proper vintage . Peyton 's wife had died three years earlier , taken by breast cancer , and although there were plenty of women in town of the correct vintage who might have been prepared to offer Peyton some comfort on a winter 's evening , he just was n't interested . He had loved his wife . Occasionally he was still lonely , although less often than before , but those feelings of loneliness were specific , not general : he missed his wife , not female company , and he viewed the occasional pleasure that he took in the sight of a young , good-looking woman merely as a sign that he was not entirely dead below the waist . God , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small indulgence . If God was going to make a big deal of it , then , well , Peyton would have a few words for Him too , when eventually they met . <p> The problem with Artie Hoyt 's daughter was that , although she was young , she was by no means good looking . Neither was she lithe . In fact , she was the opposite of lithe and , come to think of it , the opposite of light too . She 'd never been what you might call svelte , but then she had left town and gone to live in Baltimore , and by the time she came back she 'd piled on the pounds . Now , when she walked into church , Peyton was sure that he felt the floor tremble slightly beneath her feet . If she were any bigger , she 'd have to enter sideways ; that , or they 'd be forced to widen the aisles . <p> And so , the first Sunday after she 'd returned to the parental home , she had entered the chapel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring in appalled fascination at her ass , jiggling under a red-and-white floral dress like an earthquake in a rose garden . His jaw might even have been hanging open when he turned to find Artie Hoyt glaring at him , and after that , well , things had never been quite the same between them . They had n't been close before the incident , but at least they 'd been civil when their paths had crossed . Now they rarely exchanged even a nod of greeting , and they had n't spoken to each other until fate , and the missing Faraday boy , had forced them together . They 'd been part of a group of eight that had started out in the morning , quickly falling to six after old Blackwell and his wife seemed set to pass out and had , reluctantly , turned back for home , then five , four , three , until now it was just Artie and him . <p> Peyton did n't understand at first why Artie did n't just give up and go home himself . Even the modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , and they had been forced to stop repeatedly to allow Artie to catch his breath and gulp water from the bottle that he was carrying in his rucksack . It had taken Peyton a while to figure out that Artie was n't going to give him the satisfaction of knowing that he 'd kept searching while Artie had faded , even if the other man were to die in the attempt . With that in mind , Peyton had taken a malicious pleasure in forcing the pace for a time , until he acknowledged that his needless cruelty was rendering null and void his earlier efforts at worship and penitence , the occasional glance at young women notwithstanding . <p> They were nearing the boundary fence between this property and the next , a field of fallow , overgrown land with a small pond at its center sheltered by trees and rushes . Peyton had only a little water left , and Molly was thirsty . He figured he could water her at the pond , then call it a day . He could n't see Artie objecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quitting , and not him . <p> " Let 's head into the field there and check it out , " said Peyton . " I need to get water for the dog anyway . After that , we can cut back onto the road and take an easy walk back to the cars . Okay with you ? " <p> Artie nodded . He walked to the fence , rested his hands upon it , and tried to hoist himself up and over . He got one foot off the ground , but the other would n't join it . He simply did n't have the strength to continue . Peyton thought he looked like he wanted to lie down and die , but he did n't . There was something admirable about his refusal to give up , even if it had less to do with any concerns about Bobby Faraday than his anger at Peyton Carmichael . Eventually , though , he was forced to admit defeat , and landed back down on the same side on which he 'd started . <p> " Goddammit , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll boost you over . " <p> " I can do it , " said Artie . " Just give me a minute to catch my breath . " <p> " Come on . Neither of us is as young as he was . I 'll help you over , and then you can give me a hand up from the other side . No sense in both of us killing ourselves just to prove a point . " <p> Artie considered the proposal and nodded his agreement . Peyton tied Molly 's leash to the fence , in case she caught a scent and decided to make a break for freedom , then leaned down and cupped his hands so that Artie could put one booted foot into his grip . When the boot was in place , and Artie 's hold on the fence seemed secure , Peyton pushed up . Either he was stronger than he thought , which was possible , or Artie was lighter than he looked , which seemed unlikely , but , either way , Peyton ended up almost catapulting Artie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left leg and right arm on the slats saved Artie from an awkward landing on the other side . <p> " The hell was that ? " asked Artie once he had climbed down and had both feet on firm ground once again . <p> " Sorry , " said Peyton . He was trying not to laugh , and only partially succeeding . <p> " Yeah , well , I do n't know what you 're eating , but I could sure do with some of it . " <p> Peyton began climbing the fence . He was in good condition for a man of his age , a fact that gave him no little pleasure . Artie reached a hand up to steady him and , although Peyton did n't need it , he took it anyway . <p> " Funny , " said Peyton , as he stepped down from the fence , " but I do n't eat so much anymore . I used to have a hell of an appetite , but now some breakfast and a snack in the evening does me just fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt to stop my damn pants from falling down . " <p> There was an unreadable expression on Artie Hoyt 's face as he glanced down at his own belly and reddened slightly . Peyton winced . <p> " I did n't mean anything by that , Artie , " he said quietly . " When Rina was alive , I weighed thirty pounds more than I do now . She fed me up like she was going to slaughter me for Christmas . Without her ... " <p> He trailed off and looked away . <p> " Do n't talk to me about it , " said Artie after a moment had passed . He appeared anxious to keep the conversation going , now that the long silence between them had at last been broken . " My wife does n't believe it 's food unless it 's deep fried , or comes in a bun . I think she 'd deep-fry candy if she could . " <p> " They do that in some places , " Peyton said . <p> " You do n't say ? " Artie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that . Chocolate 's the closest that she gets to health food as it is . " <p> They began walking toward the pond . Peyton let Molly off the leash . He knew that she had sensed the presence of water , and he did n't want to torment her by forcing her to walk at their pace . The dog raced ahead , a streak of brown and white , and soon was lost from sight in the tall grass . <p> " Nice dog , " said Artie . <p> " Thank you , " said Peyton . " She 's a good girl . She 's like a child to me , I guess . " <p> " Yeah , " said Artie . He knew that Peyton and his wife had not been blessed with children . <p> " Look , Artie , " said Peyton , " there 's something I 've been meaning to say for a while . " <p> He paused as he tried to find the right words , then took a deep breath and plowed right in . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home , I  --  Well , I wanted to apologize for staring at her , you know , her . . . " <p> " Ass , " finished Artie . <p> " Yeah , that . I 'm sorry , is all I wanted to say . It was n't right . Especially in church . Was n't Christian . It was n't what you might think , though . " <p> Suddenly , Peyton realized that he had wandered onto marshy ground , conversationally speaking . He now faced the possibility of being forced to explain both what he believed Artie might have thought Peyton was thinking , and what , in fact , he , Peyton , had been thinking , which was that Artie Hoyt 's daughter looked like the Hindenburg just before it crashed . <p> " She 's a big girl , " said Artie sadly , saving Peyton from further embarrassment . " It 's not her fault . Her marriage broke up , and the doctors gave her pills for depression , and she suddenly started to put on all this weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that 's part of it , you know , the eating . She gets sad , she eats more , she gets sadder , she eats even more . It 's a vicious cycle . I do n't blame you for staring at her . Hell , she was n't my daughter , I 'd stare at her that way too . In fact , sometimes , it shames me to say , I do stare at her that way . " <p> " Anyway , I 'm sorry , " said Peyton . " It was n't . . kind . " <p> " Apology accepted , " said Artie . " Buy me a drink next time we 're in Dean 's . " <p> He put his hand out , and the two men shook . Peyton patted Artie on the back . He felt his eyes water slightly , and blamed it on his exertions . <p> " How about I buy you a beer when we 're done here ? I could do with something to toast the end of a long day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get the  --  " <p> He stopped . They were within sight of the sheltered pond . It had been a popular trysting spot , once upon a time , when both Artie and Peyton were much younger men , until the land changed hands and the new owner , the God-fearing man whose estate was now being fought over by his godless relatives , had let it be known that he did n't want any adolescent voyages of sexual discovery being embarked upon in the vicinity of his pond . A large beech tree overhung the water , its branches almost touching the surface . Molly was standing a small distance from it . She had not drunk the water . She had , in fact , stopped several feet from the bank . Now she was waiting , one paw raised , her tail wagging uncertainly . Through the rushes , something blue was visible to the approaching men . <p> Bobby Faraday was kneeling by the water 's edge , his upper body at a slight angle , as though he were trying to glimpse his reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck , attached to the trunk of the tree . He was swollen with gas , his face a reddish-purple , his features almost unrecognizable . <p> " Ah , hell , " said Peyton . <p> He wavered slightly , and Artie reached up and put his arm around his companion 's shoulder as the sun set behind them , and the wind blew , and the host bowed low in mourning . <p> Copyright 2009 by John Connolly <br> Continues ...
