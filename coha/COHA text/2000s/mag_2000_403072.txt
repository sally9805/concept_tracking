Section : YOUR HEALTH We tested what 's in the alternative " mood " pills . <p> Americans have a long history of altering their moods  --  with chemicals ranging from alcohol and illicit drugs to prescription medications such as diazepam ( Valium ) for anxiety and fluoxetine ( Prozac ) for depression . Today there 's a new trend : the over-the-counter availability of apparently effective mood modifiers in the form of herbs and other so-called dietary supplements . <p> Sales of three such do-it-yourself products  --  St. John 's wort , s-adenosyl-methionine ( SAM-e ) , and kava  --  now approach $400 million a year , according to the Nutrition Business Journal . Industry and survey data on St. John 's wort and kava indicate that most users are merely " looking for something to elevate their mood as a pick-me-up , " according to Bernd Wollschlaeger , M.D. , clinical assistant professor of medicine and family medicine at the University of Miami . Whether these products have any effect on garden-variety sadness or nervousness is not known , mainly because standard tests are n't sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Experts do say that with the possible exception of kava , these remedies wo n't elevate a normal , undisturbed mood . <p> In contrast , there 's at least some evidence  --  ranging from modest for kava to fairly solid for St. John 's wort  --  that these pills can help people with clinically significant mood disorders . In fact , clinical trials have found that SAM-e ( a substance in all human cells ) and extracts of the plant St. John 's wort relieve some types of depression as effectively as a prescription antidepressant . And at least one trial of kava , a Pacific-island pepper plant , suggests it may tame anxiety as effectively as a standard antianxiety drug . ( St. John 's wort and kava can be made as teas , but whether teas work like pills has n't been studied . Similarly , it 's not known whether the St. John 's wort or kava is effective or even safe when added to foods  --  see " Frontlines " page 8 . ) THE RISKS <p> One problem is that many people who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depressed to require professional care and monitoring . Self-treatment can be dangerous , particularly with depression , which causes some 20,000 reported suicides a year in the U.S. In 1999 , Cornelia Lange , M.D. , of the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center in Albuquerque , surveyed 83 patients diagnosed with depression , anxiety , or other psychiatric illnesses and found that more than two-thirds had been self-medicating with herbs such as St. John 's wort and kava . ( They did not know about SAM-e , which had just hit the shelves . ) A major reason , she says , is that " people will do anything to avoid the stigma of seeing a psychiatrist . " Another likely reason : While herbal and other alternative remedies can have adverse effects , including harmful drug interactions , they have a reputation of causing fewer significant adverse effects than prescription medications  --  such as the reduced sex drive caused by fluoxetine ( Prozac ) and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs , the most commonly prescribed antidepressants ) or the addictive potential of certain antianxiety drugs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dietary supplements have not been studied as intensively as pharmaceutical drugs , it 's possible that additional adverse effects may appear with long-term use . <p> Another major pitfall is that dietary supplements are largely unregulated by the government , so consumers have almost no protection against substandard preparations . That lack of standardization helps explain why many physicians in the U.S. have n't been recommending those remedies , despite the positive studies . Consumer Reports ' recent tests have found that the amount of certain key ingredients in the supplements saw palmetto , ginkgo biloba , echinacea , and ginseng can vary considerably from brand to brand . <p> To let consumers and doctors know the actual amount of certain key ingredients in the major mood-changing pills , we tested representative brands of the best sellers : St. John 's wort , SAM-e , and kava . We present these findings as a set because many experts now consider depression and anxiety to be interrelated . For example , anxiety can be the first sign of mild depression , and certain antidepressant drugs can also ease anxiety . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most part , manufacturers of all three remedies are producing reasonably well standardized products . However , our tests did reveal a significant problem with several SAM-e labels ( see box at right ) . <p> This report lays out the benefits and risks of these alternative treatments , compares them with conventional medications , and gives our recommendations on when they may be worth considering and what precautions to take . Since most brands we tested turned out to be basically equivalent , we 'll also tell you which ones will cost you the least per equivalent daily dose . ST JOHN 'S WORT : HERBAL CHALLENGER <p> Many studies have shown that St. John 's wort , the best-selling mood-changing supplement , is effective in relieving mild-to-moderate depression . In September , the British Medical Journal published the impressive results of the largest clinical trial of the herb so far , involving 324 patients . The six-week study , from Germany , found that St. John 's wort was therapeutically equivalent to imipramine ( Tofranil ) , an older antidepressant that 's still moderately popular , and caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wort may work in multiple ways , including effects on dopamine and other brain chemicals . <p> In an unprecedented acceptance of an herbal remedy , new treatment guidelines from the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine , the nation 's largest medical-specialty group , have given its members the green light to consider recommending St. John 's wort for short-term treatment of mild-to-moderate depression . However , there 's no evidence that the botanical will help people who have a severe depression  --  or who do n't have clinical depression but just feel a little blue . The National Institute of Mental Health is now conducting a clinical trial that will put St. John 's wort to the crucial test , pitting it against an SSRI antidepressant , sertraline ( Zoloft ) ; results are due next year . <p> Taken alone , St. John 's wort is generally well tolerated ; its only major side effect is increased sensitivity to sunlight . However , the herb does pose one important risk : It can potentially decrease the effectiveness of a host of medications , including oral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blockers for high blood pressure and coronary heart disease , protease inhibitors for HIV infection , and many other prescription drugs . And it should n't be taken with another antidepressant , since the herb can magnify the medication 's effects and side effects . <p> As for price , the St. John 's wort brands we tested cost about $5 to $35 per month ( which is n't reimbursable ) for a 2.7-milligram ( mg ) daily dose of dianthrones ( possibly active ingredients ) . In comparison , the most popular SSRI , fluoxetine , costs a generally reimbursable $85 or so , and the generic version of the most popular older antidepressant , amitriptyline , runs about $20 . SAM-E : MOOD MOLECULE ? <p> This omnipresent cellular substance helps cells regulate the brain chemicals dopamine and serotonin . SAM-e is sold over the counter and by prescription in several European countries . Over 40 clinical trials offer some support for using SAM-e to treat various depressive disorders , though many of the studies were very small or brief , or used intravenous SAM-e . The latest study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAM-e might work even against moderate-to-severe depression . In that study , a not-yet-published clinical trial from Italy involving 281 patients , SAM-e matched the effectiveness of the antidepressant imipramine , with fewer side effects . <p> The known side effects of SAM-e are mild  --  mostly stomach upset , insomnia , and nervousness  --  though it reportedly can trigger mania , or inappropriate euphoric behavior , so people with manic tendencies should avoid it . SAM-e does not appear to interact with other medications , although it theoretically may increase the effects of antidepressants . Note that SAM-e is expensive : The brands we tested cost roughly an unreimbursible $55 to $260 per month for a 400-mg daily dose . KAVA : NATURE 'S VALIUM ? <p> The extract of the root of this plant , long used in traditional ceremonies by Pacific islanders , reputedly eases anxiety , elevates mood , and relaxes muscles . Laboratory research suggests that kava may block a nerve-stimulating chemical in the brain or boost the impact of a nerve-inhibiting chemical . Several small clinical trials have found that kava helps curb anxiety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorders found kava just as effective as the prescription antianxiety drug oxazepam ( Serax ) . <p> Kava can magnify the potency of other antianxiety medicines and reduce the effectiveness of several other drugs , notably Parkinson 's drugs containing levodopa ( Larodopa , Sinemet ) . Though side effects are generally mild , kava can impair coordination and blur vision in some people . So do n't take it with alcohol , and use caution if you drive after taking the herb . Kava is n't reimbursable , and the brands we tested cost about 40 cents to $1.20 for a 200-mg daily dose of kavalactones ( the active ingredients ) , compared with about 50 cents for diazepam , the generic version of Valium . RECOMMENDATIONS <p> Consumers Union 's medical consultants advise people who are considering treatment with dietary supplements for depression or anxiety to follow these guidelines : <p> <p> Serious emotional disorders  --  particularly depression  --  should definitely be evaluated by a physician or mental-health professional . Obvious signs of a serious problem include suicidal thoughts ; difficulty going to work or school due to distressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . Until more study results are in , severe mood disorders should be treated with well-studied medications and/or psychotherapy , not dietary supplements . <p> <p> For mild emotional problems , some experts feel it 's reasonable for people to treat themselves with one of the three mood modifiers , provided they seek help if the trouble persists or gets worse . But distinguishing a mild problem from a serious one can be difficult . Moreover , a professional can suggest treatments you might not have considered . And if you do try a mood-changing supplement , a professional can help you monitor your progress . ( That 's particularly important if you 're taking the pills for more than a few months , since their long-term safety and efficacy are unknown . ) Our consultants say the most prudent course is to talk with your doctor before trying such remedies . <p> <p> If you 're taking any prescription drugs and you want to try St. John 's wort or kava , ask your doctor or pharmacist to check for possible drug interactions . <p> <p> Optimal dosage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing 600 to 900 mg a day of hypericum extract ( St. John 's wort )  --  and standardized to 0.3 percent dianthrones or hypericin ( see table introduction on page 60 )  --  have worked in clinical trials . For the other remedies , the daily dosages in successful trials have ranged from 400 to 1,600 mg of SAM-e and 60 to 240 mg of kavalactones . <p> <p> St. John 's wort and SAM-e start working in three to six weeks . Kava takes as little as a half-hour to kick in , so it can be taken intermittently , for isolated bouts of anxiety . <p> TESTS OF ST . JOHN 'S WORT PILLS <p> Our results were reassuring : All 13 brands contained a reasonably standardized dose of dianthrones , a group of possibly active ingredients . ( Our results confirmed that what most labels call hypericin  --  a member of the dianthrone group  --  actually refers to the entire group . ) Look for the least-expensive brands , as listed below . TABLE <p> TESTS OF SAM-E PILLS <p> Our tests of 12 brands of SAM-e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonably stable standardized product . But the labels were often ambiguous , and we considered some misleading . The labels on four brands  --  FoodScience of Vermont , MotherNature.com , Natural Treasures , and Nature 's Vision  --  said they contained 200 milligrams ( mg ) of SAM-e per pill , but our tests showed that they actually contained 110 mg or less . Apparently , the 200 mg referred not to SAM-e alone but to an entire SAM-e complex , about half of which is a stabilizing compound . ( MotherNature.com 's label did mention that fact , but only in a small , technically worded note on the side of the bottle . ) Those four brands , which contained the least SAM-e per pill , were among the most expensive per daily dose . ( Note that three manufacturers said they 'll be changing either the label or the amount of SAM-e  --  see footnotes . ) Costs varied widely among all brands , so look for the least-expensive ones . TABLE <p> TESTS OF KAVA PILLS <p> Our tests determined the amount of kavalactones , the reputed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that all 13 brands that claimed to contain standardized extract did contain approximately the amount of kavalactones that their label said . The two powdered-root products , Spring Valley and Botanic Choice , did not list their kavalactone content . Testing showed that these root products supplied relatively low amounts of kavalactones , even if you took the relatively large maximum number of pills recommended on the label . We advise choosing the least-expensive brands , as shown below . TABLE <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p>
