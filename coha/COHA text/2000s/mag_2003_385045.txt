If you ask Fido , " Why did God make you ? " he probably wo n't respond with the Baltimore Catechism answer , but he may just show you how to reflect on the wonder of God 's creation . <p> Dulcinea is a real seeker of the mysteries . In fact , in the first few weeks she lived with me , she consumed a book of daily scripture reflection ( cover to cover ! ) , tore pages out of my Bible , chewed the ends off a wooden cross , and even absconded with a stack of brochures about retreats in the area . It seems as though she was just born with a craving for the spiritual gifts , as well as Milk-Bone dog treats and the occasional Snausage . <p> Dulcinea is a name that means " sweet one , " from the story of Don Quixote  --  whose theology of optimism caused him to see only beauty in a woman with a checkered past . So I named my 12-pound , 8-week-old Labrador retriever Dulcinea ( Dulci for short ) because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eighty pounds , two years , and about 72 pairs of shoes later , the name still holds at least half the time . <p> When I got Dulci , I was in an independent phase . Perhaps it was my quarter-life crisis , but after a messy break-up with a long-term boyfriend , I was pretty much emotionally withdrawn from most things , particularly God . <p> But watching this puppy , this tiny , little baby creature only just being introduced to the world around her with sounds and people , rainstorms , televisions , trees , water , and everything else , was a spiritual gift . I would sneeze , and she would cock her little head and stare at me like I was a mutant , trying to wrap her mind around this ridiculous outburst I had made . In contemplating her , I found myself unconsciously slipping into prayer and meditation  --  in wonder and in thanksgiving . <p> Parents can relate to this in an even greater sense , holding their own babies and being fascinated by the way they soak up their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point in my life , it was my dog who brought me back to a quiet in the soul , a wonderment for life itself and all its intricacies . <p> We 've all heard stories of people whose pets have changed their lives , who have been , both literally and figuratively , lifesavers . A friend of mine was rescued from the bottom of a swimming pool by the family 's trusty German shepherd , Duke . <p> The Web site AmericanCatholic.org , a Franciscan ministry , has a message board where visitors can add stories of how their pets are signs of God 's love . The stories from 2003 alone run nearly 50 pages worth  --  a dog that saved its diabetic owner during a blood sugar crash , a stray cat that was a companion to a bed-ridden man , a rescued dog that gave her owner new hope after a divorce , a cat who cuddled another as it was dying . There are reflections on ferrets , fish , horses , parrots , hamsters , and , of course , dogs and cats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Animals are intimately entwined in the culture and imagery of scripture . Jesus is the Lamb of God ; Jesus is also the Good Shepherd who takes care of the sheep ( that 's us ) . There are doves of peace , donkeys that take a pregnant Mary to Bethlehem and a revered Jesus down the streets of Jerusalem on Palm Sunday , and ravens who bring bread to Elijah . Animals star in the stories of Noah , Jonah , and many others . In fact , the Bible mentions more than 120 species of animals . Over and over we learn that God cares abundantly for all the creatures of the Earth . <p> Dozens of saints , not least of all Saint Francis of Assisi , are remembered for their care of and special relation to animals . In many saints ' stories , would-be martyrs were thrown to the " wild animals , " but the animals refused to eat them , presumably because the animals knew they were people of God . <p> Saint Francis is the patron saint of animals , and Catholics celebrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on October 4 . One of Francis ' best-known miracles was a time when he gave a sermon to a flock of birds who then flew off in a cross formation , a sign of their comprehension of his words . Several accounts tell of Francis ' attempts to convert animals , speaking to them and caring for them . He even tamed a wild wolf . <p> The Catechism of the Catholic Church tells us God surrounds animals with his providential care , and " by their mere existence they bless him and give him glory . " It talks about the human imperative to be stewards of creation , to care for and respect animals and their place in our world . Not surprisingly , there is no mention of trying to convert them . I think Francis was on his own with that one . <p> But I do wonder : If God cares for the animals , is it possible they could care for God in return ? If I see God so clearly in my dog , if I know that God knows her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has some idea , however vague , that there is a higher being that created her and cares for her ? Clearly , Francis of Assisi thought animals were capable of this knowledge . <p> Let me be clear that I do n't think that when I 'm away my dog is preparing a liturgy for the neighborhood animals or spending long hours in prayer and meditation . And I do n't think it 's necessary to " convert " her . But I think it 's possible she has a sense of her creator . <p> When the dog of my childhood , Dolly , was dying , my very religious family stood around her in her last days and moments of life , praying that she would pass into death without more physical suffering . Is it possible she felt the presence of a higher power calming her , soothing her , as she passed away ? Animal instincts <p> The word animal actually comes from the Latin anima , for spirit or soul . The current meaning , though , has departed from its roots , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . That 's because prevailing science , until recently , promoted the belief that animals are motivated only by physical survival and necessity and are not capable of emotion . <p> But in the last few decades , biologists have shown that animals can exhibit concern for one another as well as altruistic behavior , reconciliatory action , and peacemaking tendencies . There is even evidence that the brain functions we use to make moral decisions existed in animals as far back as 5 million years ago . <p> What exactly does that mean ? It means that the lowly beasts of the earth may not be as lowly as we think . It means that there may be proof that the connection people feel to their pets and other animals  --  a connection many others scoff at  --  can be reciprocal . The animal does n't just want food , it wants you . <p> From Aesop to Walt Disney and my personal favorite , Babe , anthropomorphic  --  talking , thinking , loving , reasoning  --  animals have fascinated storytellers and listeners . People have always been intrigued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is exclusively human ? What sets us apart ? Many would say that only humans have the ability to reason . <p> But Jane Goodall , one of the first scientists to reveal the complicated nature of higher mammals , says in Reason for Hope ( Warner Books ) that as soon as she stared into the eyes of a chimpanzee , there was no question she " saw a thinking , reasoning personality looking back . " Goodall 's work banged many dents in the line that separates animals and humans , like tool making and emotional response . <p> In fact , Goodall not only recognizes animals ' advanced emotional capacity , she believes that animals reveal the mystical side of nature , that they connect us to God . A deeply religious person herself , she found that observing nature was a meditation on divinity . She says , " When I was away from the forest and plunged into the developed world , I found it harder to sense the presence of God . " <p> What better way to praise and love God than by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cat slinking around the house , sometimes I think it 's like having a little tiger right there in my living room , " a friend tells me . It 's a microcosm of the planet right in our midst . <p> His wife 's lizard is cause for reflection , too , this time on the primitive reptiles  --  like a dinosaur , so ancient and complex with its spiny-ridged back and luminous green scales . How did this creature come to be ? What kind of amazing universe produced it ? For animal lovers , there is no end to the musing . The pet connection <p> One of the " raising your puppy " books I read cautioned that some people get a pet " to satisfy their own emotional needs . " Did I miss something ? Is n't that why everyone gets a pet ? Seeing as few people house domesticated animals for the purpose of farm work or even hunting these days , it seems that most get a pet because they want a pal , a companion , a connection to another living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to pay attention to them . <p> Why is it that older people who have pets live longer ? Because they 're not lonely , because they feel loved , because something tells them every day , " Oh my God ! I 'm so glad you 're home ? ' <p> Now that so many young adults are choosing to have children later in life , a pet can fulfill the want of something to care for and cuddle , and in many cases serve as a dress rehearsal for human offspring . Many empty-nesters also find themselves bringing pets into their home to fill in some of the activity and affection that 's been missing in the house since the kids moved out . <p> For some people owning a pet is the first time they feel loved unconditionally , and for others the affection they show their pet is the first time they allow themselves to give love freely . <p> And maybe , when watching the news gets you down , it 's nice to experience a part of creation that is unadulterated by the negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addiction , cynicism , the politics of power , exploited sexuality , and the desire for bigger , better cars , faster computers , and smaller cell phones . <p> It 's a blessing to reconnect to creation through a creature who thinks a stick is just about the most exciting thing in the world , that a new tennis ball is reason for jubilation , that squirrels and starlings are exotic and wonderful , who loves to be outside in the rain , who loves to get dirty in the earth , and who is happy as a clam just to sit beside you . <p> Pets provide love for the lonely and laughter for the downhearted . A pet 's simple presence in the home can be a great reminder to humans that we , too , are creatures of this world , not creators and controllers , as we often like to think . <p> I 'm no animal rights activist out protesting the milking of cows . I 'm not even a vegetarian . And I 'm not shouting , " Pets are people , too ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated than we may think . We may not be totally aware of animals ' capacity as arbiters of the holy . <p> To me , Dulci is a constant reminder of the beauty  --  the intricate , meticulous engineering  --  of creation . Surely , she is a sign of God 's love and care for us , for all creatures . And that gives me hope . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Tara K. Dix <p> <p> TARA K.
