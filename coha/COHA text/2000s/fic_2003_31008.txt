Chapter Two Kyle stared at the empty doorway . " I ca n't believe I was such a spaz , knocking the damn chairs over . " He turned to Nelson . " And you ! Giving him that stupid button . Why 'd you do that ? " Nelson gave a contrite shrug . " I guess I screwed up , did n't I ? " Kyle glanced toward the door . " Maybe I can catch up with him . " In an instant , he raced through the door and down the four flights . When he reached the front stoop , he looked down one end of the street , then the other . Had the man of his dreams really shown up at the meeting ? He searched every block around the neighborhood . Only after he was completely convinced Jason was nowhere to be found did he grudgingly board the Metro toward the suburbs . Crestfallen , he cursed Nelson all the way home . * * * " Kyle ? Honey , are you okay ? " Deep in thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front-lawn flower bed . She grabbed a handful of tulip bulbs . " You look a little troubled . " Kyle watched her plant the bulbs in the newly dug earth , wishing he could tell her about Jason . Of course , first he 'd have to tell her he was gay . She 'd get upset and tell his dad . He 'd make a federal case out of it . Guaranteed . Kyle handed her some bulbs . " I 'm fine . Is there anything to eat ? " " Cookies , in the kitchen . Be careful , I just waxed the floor . By the way , Dad has a surprise for you . " She called after him . " Remember to wipe your feet ! " Kyle kicked his shoes off inside the front door and set them on the shelf for shoes . His mom was pretty obsessive about cleanliness . His dad sat in his recliner watching a football game . Kyle grabbed a couple of cookies . " Mom said you have a surprise for me . " His dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out an envelope . " Ta-dah ! Guess . Come on . " Kyle hated when his dad treated him like a kid . He was seventeen now . " I do n't want to guess . " He bit into a cookie . His dad 's mouth drooped . " You used to love to guess . " He sighed and opened the envelope , revealing the contents like he was at the Academy Awards or something . " Tickets to the Redskins , the Sunday after Thanksgiving . Just you and me . " Kyle said , " Great . " But his mind was still on Jason . His dad frowned . " Do n't look so excited . " Kyle shrugged and started up the stairs . Did n't his dad realize there were more important things in life than tickets to the Redskins ? He sat down on his bed and took his cap off . He opened his nightstand drawer and pulled out his yearbook . He turned the dog-eared pages to his favorite picture : Jason , number seventy-seven , was racing down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles taut , sheer power in motion . The crowd was cheering in the background . The digital clock showed six seconds before the final buzzer . His shot had led the team to the state championships . Kyle had met Jason on his first day of high school as he jostled through the crowded halls , searching for his homeroom . " Hey , wha 's up ? " called a voice behind him . " You dropped your schedule . " When Kyle turned , the cutest boy he 'd ever seen handed him his schedule and asked , " Know where room one twenty-eight is ? " Kyle 's heart wedged in his throat , but he managed to cough up an answer . " I think it 's this way . " He led the boy down the hall and discovered that their lockers faced each other . For the rest of his freshman year Kyle arrived at school early enough to greet Jason . His olive-skinned Adonis always waved a friendly " Wha 's up ? " but Kyle felt too shy to respond with anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He contented himself with stealing glimpses in the halls . Before long he 'd memorized Jason 's schedule , knowing the exact instant when he would turn the corner and pass by . Since Kyle was little , he 'd known he was different , though he could n't explain exactly how . When other boys began to talk about girls , he never felt interested . But it was another story when they bragged about their erections and first ejaculations . And while he laughed with classmates at fag and AIDS jokes , on the inside he felt ashamed and frightened . His one source of hope was the nightly news , where he saw images of gay people different from the caricatures of jokes . Gay soldiers battled in court for the right to serve in the military . Lesbian moms fought to keep their children . Protesters picketed Congress for AIDS funding . Even the grown men in high heels and elaborate costumes who laughed and paraded on Pride Day seemed anything but despicable . Then in eighth grade he got braces . That made him feel even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up . " Do n't worry , handsome . Once you get your braces off , you 'll have to fight off the girls . " Whoopee . The image failed to comfort him . Meanwhile , his dad nagged him to go out for sports . Kyle could n't throw a ball to save his life , but he liked watching the Olympic swimmers on TV . So he joined the swim team , where he hid among laps in the pool and stole underwater glances . He was just getting used to being called Metal Mouth Meeks when disaster struck again . The school nurse said he needed glasses . He came home from the optometrist 's with wire frames sliding down his nose , retreated to his bedroom , and stared in the mirror . Between braces and glasses , he felt like the ugliest , most lonely boy in the universe . Then he met Nelson . From the moment he first saw him in art class , Kyle knew Nelson was different . But when Ms. MacTraugh paired them up to draw each other 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infirmary . After school , Nelson tracked him down . " Let 's get this out . You know I 'm queer , I know you 're queer . Get over it . " He turned and started to walk away . Kyle felt a rush , like he 'd burst from the water after a high dive . He was no longer alone . " Hey ! " he shouted . Nelson turned back toward him . Kyle was n't sure what to say . He 'd called out on impulse , without thinking . He pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and tugged on his cap , stalling . " Uh , you draw really well . I mean it . " Nelson stared at him . " Thanks . My mom 's a graphic designer . She taught me . It 's not that hard , really . " Kyle stepped closer , even though he still felt a little nervous . " Really ? " " Yeah . " Nelson smiled . " I 'll show you . " Soon Kyle was spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules and did mud facials together . With Nelson , Kyle did n't have to pretend to be anything other than himself . And Nelson seemed to know everything about being gay . He told Kyle about Alexander the Great , Oscar Wilde , and Michelangelo . He explained the Stonewall Riots and defined words like cruising and drag . He told Kyle about gay youth Web sites and introduced him to out music groups like Size Queen and Indigo Girls . The most amazing thing was how Nelson talked about all this stuff in front of his own mom . She even subscribed to XY magazine for him . " How did you ever tell her ? " Kyle wanted to know . Nelson lit a cigarette . " You kidding ? She knew before I did . I 'm her fucking cause . " Kyle thought about it . " And your dad ? " Nelson 's face darkened behind a puff of smoke . " Never mind him . " When the subject changed to boys , Kyle confided he had a crush on a boy at school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night pretending it was him . Nelson took a drag on his cigarette . " What 's his name ? " " Promise you wo n't tell ? " Kyle hesitated . " Jason Carrillo . " Nelson burst out coughing . " Carrillo ? Ding-ding-ding ! Gay-dar ! Gay-dar ! Closet case . Big time . At least bi . " Kyle felt as if Nelson had just smacked him . " Shut up . He is not . How do you know ? " Nelson grinned . " The same way I knew about you . " Now Kyle thought back on it . Maybe Nelson had been right about Jason . But everyone knew Jason had a girlfriend . Last year they 'd been voted Cutest Couple . This year Debra was running for homecoming queen . Jason could n't be gay . But then why had he shown up at the Rainbow Youth meeting ? Maybe he was bi . But even if he was , Jason would never be interested in him . He 'd probably walked in by mistake , like he said . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorway of his bedroom , smiling . " Honey , are you sure you 're feeling all right ? " She raised her eyebrows . " I 've called you to dinner three times already . " The high point of the meal was a phone call from Nelson . Kyle 's dad picked up his knife and cut into his beef . " Does n't he know not to call at dinnertime ? " His mom extended the receiver to Kyle . Without even saying hello , Nelson started talking . " Where did you go ? " Kyle turned away from his parents . " None of your business . " " Stop being such a drama diva ! Come on . What do you want to do tonight ? " Kyle pondered for a moment . " Slit my wrists . " Nelson sighed into the phone . " Yeah , and after that ? " " I do n't know , " Kyle said . " I. Do n't . Know . " He slammed the receiver down and returned to the table . " Sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Kyle nodded tentatively and sat down . His dad stabbed a piece of meat with his fork . " Why does he have to call you every five minutes ? Does n't he have a life ? " His dad waved his wrist in the air . " Maybe you should develop some friends that are less , you know , that are more ... " His hand took a nosedive and thudded onto the table . " Athletic ! " Kyle 's mom glared at his dad and tugged on her ear . Kyle had figured out years ago that this was a signal for his dad to lay off . It usually took his dad a while to catch on , and tonight Kyle did n't feel like waiting . He grabbed his cap from the back of his chair . " Can I be excused ? " Back in his bedroom Kyle tried some homework , then scanned Jason 's yearbook photo into his computer . He turned off his light and rolled over in bed . His mind drifted to images of Jason in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his T-shirt sleeves , his butt framed by his jockstrap . Kyle wrapped his arm around his pillow and , smiling , fell asleep . The following Monday , Kyle arrived at school early , determined to find Jason and apologize about Nelson . But Jason was nowhere to be found . As Kyle watched for him outside the cafeteria at lunch , he heard Nelson 's voice come up behind him . " I made you a tape of the new Pansy Division . " Nelson held out a cassette . " Truly gorgeous . " " Thanks . " Kyle slipped the tape into his pocket , hoping Nelson would leave before Jason showed up . Nelson 's face brightened . " You going to lunch ? " " Not hungry . You go ahead . " But Nelson did n't budge . He stuck a finger into his blond hair and scratched . " You still upset about Saturday ? " " No , " Kyle lied . " Look , just leave me alone . " " I 'm sorry , for the thousandth fucking time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " If you 're going to be a dick about it . " He strode off . Kyle did n't see Jason at lunch or for the rest of the afternoon . When the last bell rang , he sulked toward his locker . Maybe Jason was sick or , more likely , too embarrassed to come to school . Kyle tossed his books into his locker , then closed the door . There stood Jason , clutching his red backpack across his shoulder . " Wha 's up ? " Startled , Kyle pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose . " Uh , hi . " Jason twisted his backpack strap in his hand and looked over his shoulder , taking a sweeping glance of the thinning crowd of students . " I kept stopping by here looking for you today . " He cocked his head a caring look . " I thought maybe you were sick . " Kyle melted beneath Jason 's brown eyes . " I 'm sorry , " he said , though he was n't certain why he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ... " He did n't know what he was saying , only that he was making a fool of himself . He shut his mouth and forced a smile . " Listen . " Jason swallowed and his Adam 's apple bobbed in his throat . He looked left , then right , then straight at Kyle . " About last Saturday ... I was n't sure what kind of meeting it was . " Kyle knew it was a lie but nodded politely . What else could he do ? Jason continued , his voice low . " You have n't told anyone , have you ? I mean , that you saw me there ? " Kyle saw the fear and shame in Jason 's face . " Of course not . I would n't tell anyone . " Jason let out a sigh but then added , " You do n't think Nelly I mean , Nelson will tell anyone , do you ? " Kyle did n't think so , but Jason 's worry made him worry too . Abruptly Jason drew back , gazing behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's girlfriend . " Hi , Kyle . " She gave him a sweet smile , and Kyle said hi back . But Jason looked scared senseless . Kyle realized he 'd better leave . " Well , I 'll see you later . " " Later , " Jason said , and smiled a forced , worried smile . Kyle stepped down the hall , picking up his pace . He had to find Nelson and make sure he did n't tell anyone about Jason . He hoped it was n't too late .
