I 'm sitting on the terrace of the Best Western Gateway Hotel in Santa Monica , Calif. , with my laptop open , about to embark on a little adventure . I 've been hearing a lot about Wi-Fi lately , and not just from my geekier friends . Everyone who has tried the new high-speed wireless technology loves it  --  from homeowners who use it to network all their computers , to road warriors who can now go online from airport boarding lounges . And it 's spreading to more public places like coffee shops and , not far from my home , this very hotel , where I have decided to try it and am now drawing suspicious glances from the staff . <P> The Best Western Gateway is one of two public " hot spots " listed for Santa Monica in the directory of Boingo Wireless , which offers Wi-Fi access in locations scattered across the country . I have already talked to a preternaturally cheerful customer-service rep and signed up for Boingo , which has a wireless transmitter in the hotel lobby . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit card-size Wi-Fi receiver into the PC-card slot of my laptop . The " sniffer " software then checks the air for wireless signals , and a message pops up : " The Boingo Wireless signal is available . Would you like to connect ? " A click on the trackpad and I 'm online . As my home page loads , I 'm tempted to pass my hands over my computer like a magician 's assistant : Look , no wires ! I access a website that lets me benchmark my download speed ; it clocks in at 2,920 kbps , comparable to my home cable-modem connection and 55 times as fast as the standard 56K dial-up modem . This is impressive . Heartened , I head off to my next destination : Pasadena and two free NANS ( neighborhood access networks ) operated by private users for the public good . I am filled with good cheer and the promise of a wireless future . <P> Most people who use Wi-Fi today do so in institutional settings such as schools and businesses and via a handful of pay networks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The benefits are obvious to the traveling exec who logs on to his corporate network from an airport lounge , downloads the latest revision of a huge PowerPoint file and arrives fresh and unmussed at his presentation . <P> Wi-Fi is handy around the hometown as well . Tim Bajarin , president of the tech consultancy Creative Strategies , frequently finds himself strapped for time , unable to get back to the office between meetings . " So when I know I 've got a 45-minute break , I head to Starbucks , " he says . " I log on , check my e-mail , come up to speed on information that I need and head off to my next meeting . " <P> Capabilities like this have driven the Wi-Fi equipment market to staggering growth , with unit shipments of home and business hardware climbing 319% in 2001 , according to the research firm In-Stat/MDR . More than 19 million Americans are expected to use Wi-Fi by 2006 . That growth , real and projected , has moved techies to imagine a magic , seamless , nationwide carpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ubiquitous as air .
