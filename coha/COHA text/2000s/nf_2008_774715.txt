An Injured Lion Still Wants to Roar // A LOT OF professors give talks titled " The Last Lecture . " Maybe you 've seen one . // It has become a common exercise on college campuses . Professors are asked to consider their demise and to ruminate on what matters most to them . And while they speak , audiences ca n't help but mull the same question : What wisdom would we impart to the world if we knew it was our last chance ? If we had to vanish tomorrow , what would we want as our legacy ? // For years , Carnegie Mellon had a " Last Lecture Series . " But by the time organizers got around to asking me to do it , they 'd renamed their series " Journeys , " asking selected professors " to offer reflections on their personal and professional journeys . " It was n't the most exciting description , but I agreed to go with it . I was given the September slot . // At the time , I already had been diagnosed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be among the lucky ones who 'd survive . // While I went through treatment , those running the lecture series kept sending me emails . " What will you be talking about ? " they asked . " Please provide an abstract . " There 's a formality in academia that ca n't be ignored , even if a man is busy with other things , like trying not to die . By mid-August , I was told that a poster for the lecture had to be printed , so I 'd have to decide on a topic . // That very week , however , I got the news : My most recent treatment had n't worked . I had just months to live . // I knew I could cancel the lecture . Everyone would understand . Suddenly , there were so many other things to be done . I had to deal with my own grief and the sadness of those who loved me . I had to throw myself into getting my family 's affairs in order . And yet , despite everything , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was energized by the idea of delivering a last lecture that really was a last lecture . What could I say ? How would it be received ? Could I even get through it ? // " They 'll let me back out , " I told my wife , Jai , " but I really want to do it . " // Jai ( pronounced " Jay " ) had always been my cheerleader . When I was enthusiastic , so was she . But she was leery of this whole last-lecture idea . We had just moved from Pittsburgh to Southeastern Virginia so that after my death , Jai and the kids could be near her family . Jai felt that I ought to be spending my precious time with our kids , or unpacking our new house , rather than devoting my hours to writing the lecture and then traveling back to Pittsburgh to deliver it . // " Call me selfish , " Jai told me . " But I want all of you . Any time you 'll spend working on this lecture is lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from me. " // I understood where she was coming from . From the time I 'd gotten sick , I had made a pledge to myself to defer to Jai and honor her wishes . I saw it as my mission to do all I could to lessen the burdens in her life brought on by my illness . That 's why I spent many of my waking hours making arrangements for my family 's future without me . Still , I could n't let go of my urge to give this last lecture . // Throughout my academic career , I 'd given some pretty good talks . But being considered the best speaker in a computer science department is like being known as the tallest of the Seven Dwarfs . And right then , I had the feeling that I had more in me , that if I gave it my all , I might be able to offer people something special . " Wisdom " is a strong word , but maybe that was it . // Jai still was n't happy about it . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd begun seeing a few months earlier . She specializes in helping families when one member is confronting a terminal illness . // " I know Randy , " Jai told Dr. Reiss . " He 's a workaholic . I know just what he 'll be like when he starts putting the lecture together . It 'll be all-consuming . " The lecture , she argued , would be an unnecessary diversion from the overwhelming issues we were grappling with in our lives . // Another matter upsetting Jai : To give the talk as scheduled , I would have to fly to Pittsburgh the day before , which was Jai 's forty-first birthday . " This is my last birthday we 'll celebrate together , " she told me . " You 're actually going to leave me on my birthday ? " // Certainly , the thought of leaving Jai that day was painful to me . And yet , I could n't let go of the idea of the lecture . I had come to see it as the last moment of my career , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I also found myself fantasizing about giving a last lecture that would be the oratorical equivalent of a retiring baseball slugger driving one last ball into the upper deck . I had always liked the final scene in The Natural , when the aging , bleeding ballplayer Roy Hobbs miraculously hits that towering home run . // Dr. Reiss listened to Jai and to me . In Jai , she said , she saw a strong , loving woman who had intended to spend decades building a full life with a husband , raising children to adulthood . Now our lives together had to be squeezed into a few months . In me , Dr. Reiss saw a man not yet ready to fully retreat to his home life , and certainly not yet ready to climb into his deathbed . " This lecture will be the last time many people I care about will see me in the flesh , " I told her flatly . " I have a chance here to really think about what matters most to me , to cement how people will remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way out . " // More than once , Dr. Reiss had watched Jai and me sit together on her office couch , holding tightly to each other , both of us in tears . She told us she could see the great respect between us , and she was often viscerally moved by our commitment to getting our final time together right . But she said it was n't her role to weigh in on whether or not I gave the lecture . " You 'll have to decide that on your own , " she said , and encouraged us to really listen to each other , so we could make the right decision for both of us. // Given Jai 's reticence , I knew I had to look honestly at my motivations . Why was this talk so important to me ? Was it a way to remind me and everyone else that I was still very much alive ? To prove I still had the fortitude to perform ? Was it a limelight-lover 's urge to show off one last time ? The answer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know if he can still roar , " I told Jai . " It 's about dignity and self-esteem , which is n't quite the same as vanity . " // There was something else at work here , too . I had started to view the talk as a vehicle for me to ride into the future I would never see . // I reminded Jai of the kids ' ages : five , two and one . " Look , " I said . " At five , I suppose that Dylan will grow up to have a few memories of me . But how much will he really remember ? What do you and I even remember from when we were five ? Will Dylan remember how I played with him , or what he and I laughed about ? It may be hazy at best . // " And how about Logan and Chloe ? They may have no memories at all . Nothing . Especially Chloe . And I can tell you this : When the kids are older , they 're going to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know : ' Who was my dad ? What was he like ? ' This lecture could help give them an answer to that . " I told Jai I 'd make sure Carnegie Mellon would record the lecture . " I 'll get you a DVD . When the kids are older , you can show it to them . It 'll help them understand who I was and what I cared about . " // Jai heard me out , then asked the obvious question . " If you have things you want to say to the kids , or advice you want to give them , why not just put a video camera on a tripod and tape it here in the living room ? " // Maybe she had me there . Or maybe not . Like that lion in the jungle , my natural habitat was still on a college campus , in front of students . " One thing I 've learned , " I told Jai , " is that when parents tell children things , it does n't hurt to get some external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clap at the right time , maybe that would add gravitas to what I 'm telling the kids . " // Jai smiled at me , her dying showman , and finally relented . She knew I 'd been yearning to find ways to leave a legacy for the kids . OK . Perhaps this lecture could be an avenue for that . // And so , with Jai 's green light , I had a challenge before me . How could I turn this academic talk into something that would resonate with our kids a decade or more up the road ? // I knew for sure that I did n't want the lecture to focus on my cancer . My medical saga was what it was , and I 'd already been over it and over it . I had little interest in giving a discourse on , say , my insights into how I coped with the disease , or how it gave me new perspectives . Many people might expect the talk to be about dying . But it had to be about living . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // That was the question I felt compelled to address . Maybe answering that would help me figure out what to say . I was sitting with Jai in a doctor 's waiting room at Johns Hopkins , awaiting yet another pathology report , and I was bouncing my thoughts off her . // " Cancer does n't make me unique , " I said . There was no arguing that . More than 37,000 Americans a year are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer alone . // I thought hard about how I defined myself : as a teacher , a computer scientist , a husband , a father , a son , a friend , a brother , a mentor to my students . Those were all roles I valued . But did any of those roles really set me apart ? // Though I 've always had a healthy sense of self , I knew this lecture needed more than just bravado . I asked myself : " What do I , alone , truly have to offer ? " // And then , there in that waiting room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to me in a flash : Whatever my accomplishments , all of the things I loved were rooted in the dreams and goals I had as a child ... and in the ways I had managed to fulfill almost all of them . My uniqueness , I realized , came in the specifics of all the dreams-from incredibly meaningful to decidedly quirky-that defined my forty-six years of life . Sitting there , I knew that despite the cancer , I truly believed I was a lucky man because I had lived out these dreams . And I had lived out my dreams , in great measure , because of things I was taught by all sorts of extraordinary people along the way . If I was able to tell my story with the passion I felt , my lecture might help others find a path to fulfilling their own dreams . // I had my laptop with me in that waiting room , and fueled by this epiphany , I quickly tapped out an email to the lecture organizers . I told them I finally had a title for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote . " Let 's call it : ' Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams . ' " // ( Continues ... ) //
