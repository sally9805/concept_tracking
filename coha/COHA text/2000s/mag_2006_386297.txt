In search of a Catholic church in not-so-religious Sweden , one American family living there discovers a small yet vibrant community . // Sweden . Skiing , ice-skating , Vikings , herring , ladies bedecked in glowing candle headdresses , a bilingual population , and meters and meters of snow . When my husband sprang through the front door , home from work , and announced that we had been offered the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to live abroad , these were the first thoughts that crossed my mind . Do I really want to transplant my young family to this foreign , frozen territory ? We decided , yes . Pulling them out of a perfectly good Catholic school in Seattle , Washington was a bit worrisome , but it still felt right and I had to face it : I had been praying for a Homeric change of course for us . And you know what they say about praying . The move was captivating from the start . As we got to know the Swedes , we immediately felt their deep respect for privacy , their infectious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eager way of assisting when asked for help . We also promptly discovered that Swedish is a fascinating language in that it is nothing like our native tongue . " Exit " in Swedish is " utfart , " which still causes the kids to giggle . " Thank you " is " Tack s mycket . " And the word for " children " is " barn , " which somehow made sense to us . We settled quickly and happily into our new community and school , the British International Primary School , a 15-minute walk from our rented home in Djursholm , a suburb of Stockholm . All four children could attend , and the classes were small and quite accelerated , which was what we were looking for . The environment at the school was moderately relaxed but in a " high expectation " sort of way , which worked well for our brood . We were meeting such interesting international people who were kind and welcoming . My husband found his job healthily challenging and was dug in . And the travel . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find a church . Knowing that Sweden is not a deeply religious country , this " church search " was hanging over me like a swollen Swedish snow cloud . In the entire country , there are a mere 151 priests . And of 9 million Swedes , exactly 1.6 percent are Catholic . That 's a whopping 144,000 total . Despite these statistics , I tried to stay positive . I quickly discovered that there are three Catholic churches in the city of Stockholm : St. Eric 's , St. Eugenia 's , and Marie Bebadelse . But only one offered Mass in English and that was on Sunday evenings , which did not work well for us . The hunt was on . I could not envision two years without taking part in the Mass . Before the full-on panic ensued , I began to inquire at our school regarding my dilemma . Just north of us , we were told , was a small Catholic church called the Church of Our Lady . We attended Mass in Swedish for a while but found the children were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leisurely nap . My husband and I convinced ourselves that receiving Communion alone was worth continuing . My bush-beating , however , was still on full force . I decided to approach Father Frederick Emanuelson , a small , shy priest with large , friendly eyes at the Church of Our Lady to ask if he could enlighten me . He mentioned a convent full of Bridgettine Sisters not far from our house that ran a retirement home . He said Mass there every Sunday morning at 8:30 in Swedish . We were welcome to join the sisters for Mass whenever we liked . We decided to give it a try . At least it was closer . Their order , the Order of the Most Holy Savior , was founded in the 14th century and established by , of course , St. Bridget , although they have only resided in Djursholm since 1923 . Their apostolate is prayer and tending to the elderly in the retirement home they run . Dressed in full habits , scurrying and tending to their daily details , the sisters were unfailingly darling and hospitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday . We even spent an incredibly devout Lent , Holy Week , and Easter season with them at their chapel and found ourselves moved by their remarkable piety , devotion , and faith . In this small , modest , dark chapel full of nothing but silence and sisters , I felt God 's love so completely it was palpable . Their jubilance and delight was infectious as we celebrated Christ 's Resurrection on Easter Sunday . We attended Mass among them through the spring months until I worked up the confidence to ask the humble but grand Mother Veronica to consider teaching the children religious education one hour a week . She politely and thoughtfully said she would consider it . Please , dear St. Bridget , please open a window for my family and me . One Sunday after Mass , she approached me and tenderly told me that she would n't be able to teach the children , due to the language differences . But with calm and care she informed me , " There is always the Vatican Embassy . " As we sipped coffee on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed my eyes through the trees , still barren , to a sizeable terra cotta-colored house with a Vatican flag proudly displayed on a manicured lawn . She explained that there are five residents at the embassy : three Filipino sisters ; Archbishop Giovanni Tonucci , the apostolic nuncio from Italy ; and his Hungarian assistant , Msgr . Gabor Pinter . They did have a chapel , although small , and the archbishop said Mass there every day in English . I could not believe what I was hearing : Mass in English a mere fiveminute drive from our home . She had already rung Sister Lorna , who would be expecting my call . Jackpot , my bush-beating days were over . Sister Lorna invited our family to join their small community for Mass the next Sunday . We arrived early and were welcomed by three tiny , giggling , affectionate sisters full of joy , anticipation , and curiosity . While greeted with kisses from the whole gaggle , it was strongly suggested that we provide lectors for the Mass we would celebrate together . Once introduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a kind face and a ready smile , our eldest son , John , was invited to receive altar boy training during Mass . He was thrilled , as were we . The nuncio celebrated the Mass with Msgr . Pinter , whose warmth and joyfulness set us all at ease . We spent the next 50 fabulous minutes celebrating our Mass with one another . The children , all four of them , have never sat so still or listened as closely as they did that icy , intimate morning . In one tiny chapel filled with strangers , mismatched chairs , and numerous accents , we again experienced God 's love perfectly . I was beginning to sense a pattern . Our tiny congregation has grown to a group of four to six families , depending on the departures and arrivals of expatriates . We have learned to sing the Gloria in Tagalog , been tickled as the nuncio has presented the sisters with new Italian shoes on his return from his latest trip to his homeland , and witnessed the transformation of our humble chapel into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have welcomed families from the United States , Ireland , the Philippines , Africa , England , Sweden , Mexico , and Spain . We shared a joyful Christmas Eve Mass complete with a procession from a handmade crche filled with the Holy Family , hand-sculpted by the nuncio , which was prominently displayed on the Vatican Embassy lawn . And the children provided all the lectoring . But most importantly , we have lovingly celebrated Mass together , in English , month after month . Sister Lorna , along with one of the American expatriate mothers , has even taken on religious education classes for our children . And together they are doing a fabulous job . We 've now called Sweden home for 16 months . We have skied snowcapped mountains , skated on frozen lakes , and learned to acquire a taste for some herring . We 've visited the Ice hotel , taken part in St. Lucia Day , and experienced the exhilaration of dog sledding .
