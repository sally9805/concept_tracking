United States <p> Washington , D.C. <br> June 14 , 1:25 A.M. <br> Foggy Bottom <p> Anthony Ruiz heard the phone ring . But at this hour , he was simply not able to translate the shrill tone into the usual reflexive actions that required opening his eyes and stretching out his arms to pick up the receiver . <p> The answering machine in the hallway of his one-bedroom Foggy Bottom apartment collected the call . Satisfied that this momentary sleep interruption had disappeared , Anthony Ruiz turned over onto his stomach and relaxed . <p> Until he heard the voice booming from the answering machine 's speakers . <p> " Tony , it 's Tolberg , wake up . Your cell phone is off . Turn on CNN and call me back in the office . " <p> Tony Ruiz 's eyes unlocked as his body riveted into an upright position . He looked at the clock and saw that it was 1:27 A.M. Jeezus , what the hell was Isaiah J. Tolberg , the president 's imposing chief of staff , doing awake at this hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mannerisms , and sartorial elegance , the sixty-eight-year-old White House chief of staff ran President Gene Laurence 's office with an iron fist . At the White House , everyone , including the president , addressed the former six-term senator from Kansas only as " Senator . " <p> Tony Ruiz reached for the phone and stuck his index finger into the air , ready to jab in the requisite seven numbers that would get him Tolberg 's office in the White House 's West Wing . But he stopped after the first three digits , remembering the message 's admonition to first turn on the television . <p> Ruiz zapped the remote on his way to the bathroom and punched in CNN . Standing over the toilet , he strained to hear the television 's volume over the gurgling of his urine hitting the toilet-cleaner blue of the bowl 's water . Within seconds , he understood the urgency of Tolberg 's call . <p> " Shit , " Tony Ruiz gasped . <p> The voice on the tube was that of a female reporter  --  her voice strained with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognizing CNN 's Los Angeles correspondent . He knew the voice ; her didactic delivery was engraved in his mind . During the campaign , CNN 's California correspondent had been the only reporter to ever have successfully rattled President Eugene Laurence 's cage with a battery of questions designed to raise doubts about Laurence 's easy demeanor . The questions had implied that the candidate suffered from an intellectual laziness that had him floating above tough issues while others did the hard work . The interview had been patently unfair . <p> Twenty minutes into the exchange , Laurence had interrupted his hour-long interview commitment , gotten up , and walked off the Los Angeles set . " You may be in charge of the questions , " the future president had snapped , removing the microphone from his lapel . " But I 'm the guy with the answers . And I 'm out of here . " <p> Tony Ruiz , the president 's special advisor for domestic affairs , had been left to clean up the mess with CNN . To this day , on Laurence 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration 's excellent relationship with the press . CNN 's Los Angeles correspondent . <p> Yes , he definitely recognized the reporter 's voice . <p> Ruiz shook himself back to attention and listened to the dialogue between the California-based reporter and CNN 's anchor . <p> " Ryan , in the last two days , the situation here in California has escalated from the occasional neighborhood blackout to a growing panic . We 're in the dark here in Los Angeles . The entire city is without any electricity . " <p> Ruiz finished relieving himself and padded back into the bedroom . He took one look at the television and saw CNN 's Anna Hardaway 's face on the screen . She was standing in front of a hospital ; blue emergency lights were flashing around her on the street . <p> " We 're transmitting to you off our truck 's generator and we 'll keep going as long as we have juice , Ryan . Los Angeles County General , which you can see behind me , is also on a generator . Hospital officials have told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to twelve hours . But that is hardly reassuring to this city 's residents who , at ten thirty P.M. , are now without air-conditioning and suffering the stifling ninety-degree heat that has overtaken this metropolis . " <p> Ryan Foxman , the New York  --  based bearded anchor of CNN 's Executive Office Hour , interrupted Anna 's reporting . Foxman 's show was the network 's top-ranked business broadcast . Ruiz guessed that Foxman was the only recognizable face the network could find at that hour to anchor the emergency transmission . <p> " What are city officials saying to the residents of Los Angeles , Anna ? Are they being reassured ? " <p> " Well , Ryan , you have to remember that this city 's citizens ca n't turn on their televisions at this time . " Anna Hardaway sounded a tad exasperated with her anchor 's question . " You and I are being watched everywhere else in the United States , just not here . But I 've heard reports that people all over this city are in their driveways and in the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , Anna . That was a silly question , " said Foxman . Tony Ruiz could n't remember ever hearing a news anchor admitting to a stupid question . This guy got points for honesty . <p> " I guess what I 'm really asking is what are officials saying ? How long will it be before power is restored ? " queried Foxman , now posing his question with precision . <p> " That is the eerie thing , Ryan . Nobody is saying anything . When the rolling blackouts began two mornings ago , city officials and spokespersons at WEPCO , Western Energy Power Company  --  they are the state 's largest and this city 's only electricity company  --  went out of their way to explain that citizens were going to face just a few days of rolling blackouts due to the incredibly hot weather and unusually dry spring . Twenty-four hours ago , it sounded as if they were still in control , with a plan in place to meet the surge in energy demand  --  " <p> " And now ? " Ryan Foxman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get an answer . The mayor 's office will only say that Mayor Steve Villas is in emergency meetings . We 've called the governor 's office in Sacramento and those calls have not been returned . And CNN 's Roger Fenton , standing by at WEPCO 's offices , just called my cell phone to tell me that , except for lights on the top floor , the building is locked up , tight and dark .
