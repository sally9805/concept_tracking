The tortoise beat the hare again last week , a fable that this time played out on two tours . At the Buick Invitational Jos ? Mar ? a Olaz ? bal vanquished the longest course in PGA Tour history by birdieing the last hole with a layup on a par-5 ( page Gl6 ) . This old-fashioned small ball was in character for Olaz ? bal , who in 2001 ranked 188th in driving distance , at 266 yards a pop , a number that harkens back to the days of persimmon . At the Senior 's ACE Group Classic , on Sunday , the outcome was settled on the 17th hole , a devilish par-5 . Tom Watson blasted a 309-yard drive and went for the green in two , but his bid for victory found a watery grave . Shorter and more conservative , Hale Irwin laid up and wedged his way to the title . // These were victories for the little guy , the increasingly underestimated genre of player who gets by on guile and proficiency from 100 yards in . Olaz ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pervasive belief that might makes right in the modern pro game . At 7,607 yards Torrey Pines was a course of unprecedented scale , but its outsized proportions actually muted the effects of the new atomic balls and nuclear drivers . It 's counterintuitive , but courses are now becoming so long they are beginning to favor the shorter hitter  --  or at least the shorter hitter with a strong short game . When every player is forced to lay up on a par-5  --  as happened on Torrey 's revamped 18th  --  the advantage on that hole shifts from the long hitter to the player more proficient with his wedge and putter . Likewise , as par-3s creep toward 250 yards and par-4s approach 500 , fewer players will reach the holes ' well-fortified greens in regulation , leading to a battle of the up-and-downs. // Courses are becoming not only longer but also more penal , as Irwin is well aware . He was tied with Watson on Sunday when they stepped to the 17th tee of the Club at Twin Eagles . " After Tom hit that big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my caddie and said , ' Good , I hope he goes for it now . ' " Watson could n't resist , and he hooked a four-wood into a water hazard and made bogey . Irwin 's ensuing birdie iced the tournament . " There 's more than one way to skin a cat , " he said . // The culture clash of short hitters on long courses will reach its zenith at April 's Masters . Augusta National has been retrofitted with nastier bunkers and more than 300 additional yards . The sweeping redesign moved short knocker Justin Leonard to grumble , " Great , now only five guys have a chance to win the Masters . " He clearly did n't have a dinker like Olaz ? bal in mind , even though Ollie has won two green jackets  --  in 1994 , when he finished nine under , and ' 99 ( eight under ) . // A new epoch began in the summer of 2000 when solid-core balls accelerated the distance revolution . Suddenly the Olaz ? bals of the world were unable to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and exploited its shortish par-4s . In 2001 Tiger Woods won his second Masters by going 16 under , while David Duval finished 14 under and Phil Mickelson 13 under . On a longer , harder Augusta National , par will be an increasingly precious commodity  --  in fact , the bombers may be forced to lay up on the revamped back-nine par-5s . Now Olaz ? bal , shaky driver and all , is back in the ball game , a point he drove home at Torrey Pines , a new-age course that leveled the playing field .
