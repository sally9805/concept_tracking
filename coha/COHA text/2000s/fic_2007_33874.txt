Chapter One Now Louis Desparr was content . For twenty years he had been laboring , trading , hauling , packing , portaging , fighting , and all that he had made from that generation of work was enough to give him one good stock of trade goods . That was when he determined to build Fort Lippewan . Another man would have given up , discouraged . But Louis Desparr was not discouraged . At the very moment when another would have withdrawn from the game , declaring that luck was totally against him , Louis determined to make his greatest fling of all . Louis was not only determined , but he was methodical . He believed in hard fighting , but he believed in generalship , also . First of all , he decided that he would give up the wandering life of the trapper and select a spot for stationary trading . Then he hunted through the list of possibilities that was stocked in his memory . And , when he came in his list to the Lippewan River , his eyes rolled upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two tributary streams ran into the Lippewan . He could see the point where the rocky bluff advanced well out from the shore , naturally defended by its cliff-like steepness and height , on two sides of its triangular shape . The other side , the base ofthe little peninsula , was narrow . Sometimes , at high water , a current ran across the neck , and the peninsula became a little island . But in any time or case , the site was eminently defensible . The projecting point was crowded with a heavy growth of timber . Down the river and its two tributaries , the Indians , the half-breeds , and the white mountain men could paddle their canoes with very few portages , and those only on the headwaters . They could follow a natural road down to the fort . For that was where he built it . He had to do two things . First , since the country was in the land of the Blackfeet , and he was not a great friend of theirs-having taken a Piegan scalp or two in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friendship between himself and that tribe . This he managed , at an easy stroke , by taking as squaw wife , Dancing Shadow , the daughter of the war chief , Angry Child . There was nothing pretty about Dancing Shadow , except her name . When her features were young and tender , she had been kicked in the midst of them , and they were rather mixed together as a result . One eye pulled down and one eye pulled aside . She was always looking two ways at once . Her face was so deformed that not even the thick-skinned Blackfeet bucks could persuade themselves to take her as a squaw , even as a gift . Proud Angry Child consumed his heart with disappointment and grew so tired of the sight of his daughter 's face that the very bones of his head ached when he so much as looked at her . Then arrived the trader , Louis Desparr , half English , half French . Or was there a little strain of Indian blood already in him ? He did not want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and merely asked for a worker . Dancing Squaw was as strong as an ox , and built very much like one . She stood six feet tall ; she was made solidly , and based on huge feet . And when the trader saw her , he could tell at a glance that she would be faithful , and never mysterious . So he took her . Not as a gift . He got together some horses , beads , and guns , and gave the handsome lot to Angry Child , who was almost persuaded that it had been worthwhile to wait even as long as this . The gist was a masterstroke . It restored to Dancing Shadow her self-respect . It warmed the heart of Angry Child . And it established in the minds of the Indians that this was a rich and generous white man , apt to be a little foolish in driving a bargain . All of this seed would assuredly bear fruit a hundredfold . Then Louis Desparr went with his wife down to the junction of the streams , and for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The two of them felled , trimmed , and squared trees into logs , and ran a redoubtable palisade across the neck of the peninsula . When a party of Dancing Shadow 's relatives and friends stopped by to visit with her , Desparr got their help in the hoisting of the main timbers , and once the skeleton of the buildings that was to compose the fort had been established , it was comparatively easy for him and Dancing Shadow to build up the walls and do the roofing . They toiled and moiled without a pause until the task was almost completed . Then he left her there alone , with a rifle for company , and went off down the river . He came back with all the trading stock that he could get together by spending his last cent , and mortgaging his future to the hilt . Then word was sent out to the tribes , and presently they began to come in . They still were coming . They brought in great piles of beautifully tanned buffalo robes . They brought in any quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses , too . There were suits worked with colored quills , and others heavily encrusted with beads until they were almost like suits of chain mail . Sometimes they carried in painted robes that were true works of art . Often they had exquisitely decorated canoes , carved knife handles , eagle feathers in abundance , necklaces of bear claws , baskets , pottery . Whatever they brought , the careless Louis Desparr always was willing to buy or trade for-at a price . Having once made up their minds , Indians do not readily change them . If a man is once established as a hero , he may run away from twenty fights and have his conduct attributed to mysteriously bad " medicine . " So , when Desparr gained the repute of being a rather foolishly generous price maker , the repute clung to him long after he began to drive the sharpest of bargains . Beaver skins and buffalo robes were what he wanted , but he would take anything he could get and put it in his stores , until he had a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beads , mirrors , knives , guns , lead , gunpowder , pins , needles , axes , and hatchets , and he always had tea , sugar , coffee , and trade whiskey . The last was an abomination composed of sheer grain alcohol , afterward compounded with coloring matters and greatly diluted . There was a punch in this liquor that was not altogether that of alcohol . But it was a very popular drink with the Indians . Obviously a liquid that drives a brave mad with half a pint is twice as good as whiskey of which one can consume a quart before beginning to stagger . Louis Desparr traded every morning from dawn to high noon . Then he closed up his stores . The Indians were invited to wander where they pleased and look at goods that they might wish to purchase the next day , but there was no trading in the fort of an afternoon . Dancing Shadow took charge of the stock and guarded it with her two-direction eyes that saw all things in a single glance , as it appeared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Louis Desparr was left free to conduct more important items of his affairs . For instance , he could interview the influential warriors and the big chiefs . He could chat with visitors from more distant tribes and invite them to come to this haven of just prices and good stock . He could estimate the importance of the men to whom he must give presents , and hit upon the heart 's desire of each one . For a heart 's desire is usually reasonably cheap , if it is a red man who is doing the desiring . A strip of red cloth may really , to him , be more than a string of ten war ponies . That was the secret of Desparr 's success . He saw his stores increasing . Marvelously they grew . He began to dispatch boatloads of furs in blunt-nosed , flatbottomed skiffs that could be poled or sailed downstream . For every half dozen or more of these , a narrow canoe would come nosing up the river , keeping to the shallows , delayed only by a few short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There , at Fort Lippewan , the stocks were unloaded , and so the trading went merrily on . Louis Desparr , beginning almost at bedrock , already had cleaned up thousands of dollars in a single season , and a good part of that season was still to run . No wonder that he was content as he sat on the flat roof of his main building with Henry Lessing , the hunter and trapper , both of them smoking long-stemmed pipes . The tobacco was so good-having just arrived , and being in the height of its unspoiled strength and richness of flavor-that now and again , drawing a long whiff , they half closed their eyes . Henry Lessing was an old acquaintance . Now he looked at the bustle below them , where the crowds of children , squaws , and braves were passing and re-passing , with a few white men of various kinds mixed among them . He looked at this bustle and nodded . " You 're gon na get rich , Louis , " he said . " You 'll do this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thinker , " said the other very frankly . He waved his hand beyond the palisade , where the Indian encampments were spread . There were three distinct sections of three distinct Blackfeet tribes then present . So commodious was the land that there was plenty of space for all of them to have camps where water and wood would be easy to get at , and where there was open country , besides , to race their horses and to play their games . The wigwams , half seen through the trees , shone like snow . Voices came shouting faint and far from the open land . Some young men were flogging half a dozen ponies as they raced out to a rock and back around it . Their long hair streamed out behind them . " I 'll keep to that , " said Henry Lessing . He shook his head . His skin was white , but his soul was now Indian . The other did not argue . He knew that in his own soul there was a great deal of the same urge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be beyond the need of money was , in a way , a yet pleasanter state . Lessing again looked down into the yard of the fort . " There 's the tenderfoot again , " he said . " Which one ? " said the trader . " The one that can talk the Blackfoot language . " " Is he still hunting ? " " Still hunting . " Lessing nodded . " Still looking at faces . Have you found out what he wants ? " " He wo n't talk , " said Louis Desparr . " He 'll only look . " As though the subject were irresistibly interesting , he leaned forward until he could see the man in question . (
