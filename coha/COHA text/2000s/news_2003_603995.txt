<p> The Jaguar S-Type was launched into skepticism in 1999 . <p> Could it be a real Jag , people wondered , having shared some development work and even hardware with the Lincoln LS ? Even if owner Ford Motor would n't have imposed that cost-cutting , shared-development discipline , could the S live up to the brand 's outsize reputation for the best blend of elegance and bona fide sportiness ? <p> Probably not , Jaguar purists said . Who cares , Jaguar aspirants declared . At $ 43,000 , it 's a Jag that maybe we can afford . <p> The S fulfilled its mission of doubling Jag sales and bringing the brand into the reach of a much broader audience  --  one that might later buy the expensive Jaguars . <p> Time , now , for an S-Type makeover , and it 's generally a good one . For ' 03 , the styling 's unchanged , but everything else is different  --  engines , transmissions , suspension , brakes , interior . Based on the test drive , everything changed seems to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because that 's what customers love . And we answered the criticisms leveled at it before  --  mainly that it needed to be more in keeping with the Jaguar level of refinement , " spokesman James Thomas says . <p> Neatest new gadget : easy-touch parking brake . A chrome half-circle handle  --  switch , really  --  in the console area controls the brake . Push down lightly , and the brake 's on . Lift , and the brake 's off . <p> Ca n't have a Jag driver yanking on levers or stomping on small pedals , after all . <p> Unfortunately unchanged : back-seat room . Getting in is a headbanger 's ball because of the low roof and angled door edge . Sitting there is nonsense if you 're even slightly tall . Consider the back for kids and short adults . For Jaguar prices , you should n't be asked to make that compromise . But Jag sees it as a matter of style . Make the back bigger , and you 'd foul up the elegant roofline and silhouette . And Jaguar 's always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baked-in trait . Ca n't abide it ? Go shop at the Lexus store . <p> In a way , it 's refreshing contrarianism in an industry that 's so nervous about alienating buyers . <p> Biggest news is that a supercharged model was added for the 10% of S-Type buyers who must have the most power possible  --  and , at $ 62,400 , have fat wallets , too . <p> As is Jaguar 's custom , the supercharged model is designated R and has a mesh-pattern grille . For the money , the lusty motorist gets 390 horsepower and 399 pounds-feet of torque . <p> The non-supercharged V-8 model is $ 49,975 , $ 645 more than the ' 02 V-8 car 's price . The ' 03 V-8 's been bumped to 4.2 liters from 4.0 , and sports 294 hp , 303 lbs. - ft. , vs. 280 hp , 277 lbs. - ft. in ' 02 . <p> The 3-liter V-6 base car is $ 42,495 , about the same as the original price and $ 1,180 less than the ' 02 . Power rating 's the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighs a little less and uses a six-speed automatic transmission instead of a five-speed . <p> The test car was the R , and what fun it was  --  or would have been had many of the test days not been rainy , then snowy . You do n't want to provoke the R on rain-slick asphalt unless you enjoy slithering like a teenager in a muscle car . And we 're all too mature for that , right ? <p> On snow , the car was impossible . Figure on parking it and driving your pickup until the thaw . The fat tires float and slide on snow , instead of digging in for traction . <p> If you live where it 's dry most of the time , plan on having a ball . <p> The supercharged engine delivers immediate power in significant quantities . Big brakes yank those wide tires to a stop promptly . And the computerized suspension adjusts the firmness for best control in corners , as well as to accommodate changing road surfaces . <p> It 's best , for vigorous progress , to punch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts the transmission into sport mode , which means upshifts happen near the engine 's redline . Otherwise , the transmission shifts quite a bit earlier , stunting acceleration and leaving you feeling shortchanged . <p> Superchargers are a simple way to boost power , though they are somewhat expensive and can be quite noisy . Jag has tuned the noise well . Under full throttle , the ' charger whines just enough to be heard and to add excitement to the moment . Otherwise , it 's all but silent . <p> R seats are bolstered more than in the other models , which feels good and helps hold you in place during brisk cornering . <p> The manual-shift mode of the automatic transmission is easy to use , if not as slam-bam precise as some . You simply move the gear lever sideways into a separate slot , then slide it up or down through the gears . No race-car shift paddles on the steering wheel , or firm-shifting levers . <p> And that 's perhaps emblematic of Jaguar 's approach . The pleasure 's all there to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every ounce of the driver 's concentration or the passengers ' forbearance . <p> Jag will trade away a bit of the edgy , purist appeal to keep the car easy to drive and pleasant to use those days when you just do n't have it in you to show off , or prefer to do so with attitude rather than acceleration . <p> That 's a nice approach . <p> 2003 Jaguar S-Type R <p> * What is it ?
