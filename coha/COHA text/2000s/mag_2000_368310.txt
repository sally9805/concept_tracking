GIGABEATS The next frontier in portable digital music players is space  --  storage space . You ca n't squeeze a rock epic like Kiss 's Double Platinum into the 32 MB ( an hour of music , at best ) that is standard on such popular M players as the Rio 600 . But the new Nomad Jukebox ( $499 ) , due out next week from Creative , has a hotter-than-hell 6 GB of memory . That 's enough to keep you rockin ' all night . <P> SCOOP-FREE OLYMPICS Planning to watch streaming video of those tense synchronized-diving heats on the Net ? Think again . The International Olympic Committee , at the behest of its well-heeled television licensees ( principally NBC ) , has barred all video footage of the Games from the Web . Why ? NBC wo n't be broadcasting any events live from Sydney , and the network chieftains do n't want to be undercut by enterprising Webmasters . Now if only they 'd ban those annoying Olympic mascots . <P> THE WEB AT YOUR FINGERTIPS Ever wonder how a hyperlink feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( $39.95 , for Windows only ) , you can find out . Through the magic of force-feedback technology , the iFeel actually creates the illusion that you are touching icons , links and menu items by bumping and vibrating when you move the mouse to drag your cursor over them on the screen . Let your fingers do the surfing . <P>  --  By Lev Grossman
