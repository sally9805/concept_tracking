Chapter One From : Laine Blackwell Sent : Friday To : Angie Keller ; Kathy Baker Subject : Joining in the fun Hey , all . I am sitting here at my itsy-bitsy cubicle pretending to be typing up important memos , but it 's my last day in this place ( finally ! ) and all I 'm really doing is watching the clock until my going-away party starts so everyone can come as an excuse to stop working , get free food and booze , and pretend they 'll miss me and will keep in touch . Wanting to spew coffee at the thought . In any case , as you all know , the fact that I am leaving means , as I promised , that Men To Do season is wide open . I have an entire summer of unemployed bliss ahead of me before graduate school starts in September . During that time I plan to make some man or men extremely happy to be alive , and assume they will return the favor . When September comes , I will start a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that men are more than penises mounted on thrusting devices . For now , however , let the games begin . Laine " BYE , LAAAAAINE ! We 'll miss yooou , please keep in touch , okaaaaaay ? " " Oh , I will . " Not . Laine returned the bare squeeze her soon-to-be exco-worker proffered , and nearly gagged on the way-too-familiar perfume stench . Eau de Suffocation . She sure as hell would n't miss that . This fact-checking job at I am Woman magazine was her fourth since graduating from Princeton eight years ago and she was done . Done ! June first , and she was on her way to a summer of fun and relaxation before she started Columbia journalism school in the fall . Her first real break since ... ever . Ha ! Take that , repressive slave-driving capitalist tools . She was history . Her boss , Petunia Finkseed - whose real name was much less fun so why think of her that way - shook her hand gravely . " Thanks for the hard work and good luck , Laine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , please do . There 's always a job for you here at I am Woman . " Laine grinned broadly , murmured thanks , and wondered just how high those pigs would have to fly before she 'd think about coming back . Not that it had been a bad job , by any means . But she was free ! Free ! Free from the constant pressure , from the snarly office intrigue , from the barely veiled leers of the company V.P. An entire summer stretched ahead of her ; she 'd take Manhattan by storm , do all the things she 'd wanted to since moving here after college but had never had time for . Sleeping late , reading the paper every day , taking long bubble baths , sight-seeing , irresponsibly late nights dancing during the week , trips to the beach , a solemn vow to avoid panty hose before 8:00 p.m . She wanted to take French , pottery , learn yoga , skydiving , tap dancing , cooking ... And ... find a Man To Do . Or a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online reading group , after her high school friend Samantha recommended it not only as a place to find fun and stimulating reads , but also as a good place for female companionship . Not long after , Laine had joined the smaller e-mail subset of the group , Men To Do Before Saying I Do . Their mission ? To find unattached , sexy , thoroughly inappropriate males ... and do them . What could be more perfect ? Call it an age-thirty midterm break . Then in September , graduate school at Columbia and the rest of her life would get started . She 'd be on her way to becoming America 's best reporter . Granted a few years ago she 'd enrolled briefly in a master 's English program at Boston University , and thought she was on her way to writing the Great American Novel ; and granted after college she 'd applied to medical school , but this time she was on her way . For real . She was pretty sure . She grabbed her small box of personal items - pictures of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niece Carolyn on her first birthday , the scraggly air fern that , frankly , she could n't tell was alive or dead , and the gold-plated bracelet her coworkers had chipped in and bought for her . Outta here ! Her next-door cubicle prisoner , Fred , got a genuine hug and a promise of lunch sometime , and Laine fled . Down the hall , down the elevator filled with tall , gorgeous women in black and men in dark suits , across the huge marble lobby filled with tall , gorgeous women in black and men in dark suits , and hot damn , out into the gritty dusty chaos of Times Square . Free ! She wanted to hug the harassed mom with three cranky kids , she wanted to kiss the gorgeous blond guy across the street , she wanted to create a scene by skipping , no , frolicking , no , gamboling her way to the subway , kicking up her heels and crowing like Peter Pan . Except , in Manhattan , no one would even blink . She bounced down the 42nd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , following the commuting crowds the same way she always did . But instead of bleary-eyed , leaden , sheeplike , obedient herding , she practically danced onto the subway platform . Hello , New Yorkers ! Laine 's here ! She must be practically glowing . People would raise their heads and murmur when she walked by . Who was that woman with so much joy in her heart ? What was her secret ? Instead she stepped in some just-chewed gum and spent a good three minutes trying to scrape the goo off the bottom of her chunky black heels . No more black ! The rest of the summer she 'd avoid it like the plague . Except of course a killer black minidress on a hot date . She filed onto the C-train , headed downtown and clutched her box of belongings , bumping against the other commuting bodies when the train swayed . She gazed at the ads along the top of the car to avoid gazing at other people , though she wished sometimes she could stare openly , like a child . Maybe she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A body came a little too close behind her , pressed a little harder than the crush of commuters would make necessary . A pelvis planted firmly against her rear end . Ewwww . She grimaced and let her elbow make " accidental " forceful contact with the soft male belly behind her . There was a grunt , and the body moved away . City living could be so charming . But nothing could keep her down today . Nothing ! Not even a gross grinder . So what would she do tonight ? Champagne ? A soak in the tub ? Maybe rent a nice romantic movie ? Or maybe her roommate of six months , Monica , would want to go out , not that she ever did that anymore since she 'd started dating Joe the Smotherer . Just as well . Laine should n't go too wild too soon . Taking into consideration her grad school tuition and expenses , she 'd saved barely enough to scrape through the summer without a salary , but finances would be tight if she went too crazy . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architecture firm lined up this fall , but she 'd really , really wanted the summer totally free . The train arrived at Fourteenth Street . She got off and tossed a glare at the subway humper , who grinned back obscenely . Ick . ( Continues ... )
