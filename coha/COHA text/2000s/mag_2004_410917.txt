Two Bentleys , a 25-carat diamond ring and supposedly the biggest collection of Louis Vuitton bags in North America . Bazaar reports on the extraordinary world of Kimora Lee Simmons . By William Middleton // It 's a beautiful sunny afternoon and everyone is waiting for Kimora Lee Simmons . Light streams through the windows of the family home , a 49,000-square-foot mansion on seven wooded acres where she lives with her rap mogul husband , Russell Simmons , and their two daughters . Just off the breakfast room is a rack filled with designer clothes , dozens of pairs of shoes and a vast selection of jewelry from Harry Winston-all for today 's shoot . Kimora Lee , a towering , exotic beauty , sweeps down the staircase two hours late and quickly spots the jewelry . " What 's this ? " she asks , glancing at an 18-carat diamond and platinum solitaire , a pair of five-carat diamond earrings and a 38-carat diamond and platinum bracelet . When told it is her jewelry , at least for today , she says , " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although she is joking-there are , after all , more than $6 million worth of jewels sparkling in the sunlight-the serious jewelry collector is not far from the truth . Besides , when you and your husband happen to be hip-hop royalty , you 're entitled to a little attitude . It seems that the six-foot-tall former model just ca n't help being larger-than-life . Asked to describe herself , Kimora Lee says , " Alive . Vibrant . Loud . And funny . " A glance around her Saddle River , New Jersey , house-with its palatial living room , a dining room for 30 and indoor and outdoor swimming pools-suggests she will never be called a minimalist . " No , it 's not understated , " she says of her approach to the world . " Everything I do , everything I stand for , everything I say , is very much in-your-face . But it 's easy : You either get it or you do n't . You do n't have to like it , but it 's very clear what 's going on . " Ms. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discriminating . She owns two Bentleys-an extended sedan and a brand new convertible-a Mercedes SUV , a Range Rover and has her eye on a new Ferrari . Her home is filled with important pieces from the estate of Gianni Versace , picked up through Sotheby 's . And she has no less than seven pets , ranging from adopted mutts ( now sporting Louis Vuitton collars ) to a small , black poodle . A self-confessed " diamond and stiletto girl , " Kimora Lee has an eye-popping assortment of jewelry-trays and trays of it . The most exquisite piece in her collection is a 25-carat Asscher-cut diamond ring in a platinum setting that she designed herself . " I love jewelry , " she says . " I have a lot of great stones . In terms of clarity and size , they 're pretty rare and pretty exceptional . I have more modest cuts and I have over-the-top cuts that look like you 're wearing a light bulb on your finger . " And then there 's the fashion , contained in a rambling dressing room carved out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pairs of shoes by Manolo Blahnik ( from Timberland-style stilettos to the latest patent T-strap sandals ) , is one of the largest clients for Louis Vuitton in North America-with bags by Takashi Murakami and Stephen Sprouse and loads of monogrammed luggage-and owns more than 300 pairs of jeans . Two walls , from floor to ceiling , are filled with perfectly organized shoes by Manolo , Jimmy Choo and Chanel ( some are in boxes with a Polaroid attached ) . Doors swing open to reveal two more closets packed with hundreds of bags by Vuitton , Chanel and Hermes ( including nine Birkin bags ) . Her clothes hang on color-coded racks , thousands of pieces from such favorites as Roberto Cavalli , Versace and Stella McCartney . A computer catalog , with an image of every item in her closet , is in the process of being set up . Think Alicia Silverstone 's elaborate closet catalog system in the film Clueless . " It 's a girl 's dream , " Kimora Lee says of the suite , which also boasts upholstered chairs , a television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't allowed in there , unless they 're gay , but my husband comes in sometimes to watch TV and , me being nice , I do n't throw him our . " Although there is a professional reason for Kimora Lee 's interest in style-she is the creative director of Baby Phat , the sister line to her husband 's Phat Farm clothing empire-her excessiveness can make you wonder . Seemingly every room in the house is filled with photos of Kimora Lee , while needlepoint pillows proclaim , MEN , COFFEE AND CHOCOLATE ARE ALL BETTER RICH and IT AI N'T EASY BEING QUEEN ! Scattered around are some 30 bouquets , many with several dozen pink roses ( her signature color is pink ) , reportedly all from her husband . So how does she feel about the term diva ? . " I do n't like it if it suggests someone is a bitch or difficult , " she says . " I think Marilyn Monroe was a diva , Whitney Houston is a diva . Some might put a negative tag on that but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , how they could walk into a room and command attention . I 'm into grandeur and being overthe-top but also having a wonderful spirit and a sense of giving and sharing . " Kimora Lee was born and raised in St. Louis ( deflecting a question about the exact year she says , " I 'm twenty-something now-do n't go trying to add it up-just listen " ) . Her mother is Japanese , born in Korea , while her father is African-American mixed with some Caucasian and Native American . That genetic combination , which has made her such a high-cheekboned , full-lipped beauty , was not always so kind . " I was 5 foot 11 inches in the fourth grade , " she points out . " When you 're in the fourth grade , that means weirdo . I was the ugly duckling of the family . It was always , " You 're too tall ... no one looks like you culturally ... no one 's hair lies like yours ... where do you fit in ? ' ' " When Kimora Lee was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost her self-confidence . At the tender age of 13 , she was sent to Paris and quickly signed with Chanel . " When your first job is Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld is your mentor , it makes for an easy transition , " she remembers . " Suddenly , there was acceptance : Maybe it 's not so bad to look like this , have lips like this or skin color like this . It did a lot for my self-esteem , as it would for any child who was in that kind of situation , where everything that was so wrong suddenly became so right . " She modeled for leading designers in Paris and Milan , was featured in such campaigns as Benetton 's , and arrived in New York in 1992 . Catching the eye of Russell Simmons , she became the first face of Phat Farm . At the time , Russell was already one of the most powerful figures in the world of hip-hop . He has been a force behind such stars as Run-DMC , LL Cool J and the Beastie Boys and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Russell oversees Def Pictures and Phat Fashions , and is also the chairman of Def Jam Recordings ( 2002 net revenues for the record label alone were $780 million ) . Because he was 35 years old when they first met , and she was only 17 , their relationship proceeded slowly ( " What do you think ? That I jumped into bed with him on the first day ? " she says with a laugh ) . The two were married in 1998 in Saint Barts and , although wildly different , seem devoted to one another . He is a strict vegan and practices yoga every day , while she is a carnivore and has long been suspicious of exercise . Their kitchen has two enormous refrigerators , one for his strict vegan regime and another for her lessdemanding diet . " He 's on a constant path to heighten his spiritual awareness , " she says of her husband . " Everyone who knows Russell loves him . We 're soul mates . " The couple also bonds over their two daughters-Mine Lee , three , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left my babies a day in my life , " says Kimora Lee . " Never . " One of the favorite parties she has ever given , held in 2002 , was for Ming Lee 's second birthday . The 200 guests at the circus-themed fete were treated to a life-size train , clowns and " Happy Birthday " sung by family friend Whitney Houston . Russell and Kimora Lee have had a business partnership since 2000 , when she was named creative director of Baby Phat . Her signature short skirts , bold color combinations and full-on sexuality are all over the collection . " Having been in the business since I was a preteen , I wanted Baby Phat to make a major fashion statement , " she says . Her singular style has helped turn Phat Fashions into a business with $510 million annual net revenues . At the spring show , called Turn of the Century Sex Kitten , Kimora Lee took a turn on the runway with her daughters , with her husband in the front row , then headed off to the Greenwich Village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The family owns a loft near the World Trade Center site , uninhabited since September 11 , and another home in East Hampton , New York , but their primary residence is here at their new place in Saddle River . At the foot of the long driveway , iron gates swing open and you see the home 's imposing classical French exterior and the lush grounds . " It 's really like a getaway , a little wonderland , " Kimora Lee explains . " Where I grew up , in the Midwest , we have land . I 'm used to grass and trees and parks-that 's how I wanted to raise my kids . " Pushing through the heavy double doors , one of the first things you notice is the large number of staff . The live-in head of security asks for your driver 's license . Then there are the five maids , two live-in nannies , a chef and two drivers . Kimora Lee also has four personal assistants , strategically positioned around her various offices and homes . A personal trainer , hairstylist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should look at that is : Thank God a lot of people have jobs , " she points out . " But we do have a lot of staff . You need a lot of help to run an empire . " The house , with 15 bedrooms and 20 bathrooms , is spectacular . The sunroom holds the gilded bed that once belonged to Versace , while a lower level has an indoor lap pool , a well-stocked gym and the meditation room that Kimora Lee designed for Russell 's daily yoga ( with dark red walls , rubberized black floors and a vibrant Versace rug ) . The house 's lower level also has a 15-seat cinema , replete with a full-size marquee . " We love movies , " explains Kimora Lee simply . And the compound is filled with tributes to black culture , from bold contemporary paintings to a provocative sign in the foyer that reads COLORED WAITING ROOM . " That 's Russell 's favorite sign , " Kimora Lee notes . " We have a lot of black memorabilia . It 's definitely about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you 're from , you do n't know where you 're going , honey . " That sense of awareness extends to many of the couple 's activities . Russell is very involved in social and political issues , working with the NAACP to launch the Rap the Vote campaign or meeting with the Dalai Lama on his recent trip to New York . " Russell 's friends with Minister Farrakhan , Bill and Hillary Clinton and the head of the World Jewish Congress , " she explains . " It 's neutral ground over here-we do n't take sides . " Russell and his two brothers also founded Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation , a New York City-based group that gives grants to nonprofit organizations that help urban youth access the arts and also provides exhibition opportunities for emerging artists , especially artists of color . Kimora Lee is very involved , hosting the foundation 's annual fundraiser at her home in East Hampton ; she also funds scholarships for students at her old high school . " It 's not fashionable to be snooty and hoard all your stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love fashion , but it 's most fashionable to give to those who do n't have and open up the world and the minds of young children . " When it comes to more material concerns , at a time when everyone can rattle off designer names or boast about bling-bling , Kimora Lee really knows her stuff . From her collection of Faberge eggs to an explanation of why a Bugatti is the best car in the world , she has a sincere desire for connoisseurship . " If you buy things just because they are expensive or because you can , you do n't know about them at all , " she says . " I really try to study things . " So is this young lady , whose favorite outfit is Baby Phat jeans and four-inch Manolos , having a good time ? " To say the least , " Kimora Lee says quickly . " It 's like I 'm playing dress up . I 'm a girl and that 's what girls do . When you 're not working and raising your children and giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fun .
