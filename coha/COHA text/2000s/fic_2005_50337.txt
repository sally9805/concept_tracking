On any given day , Mother could have her pick of maids . The women , usually Hmong , would line the open markets and scurry after her , offering to carry her bags . Mother decided that she was going to plan a special meal . Father was coming home from the military soon . They would celebrate . The end of his absence , their reunion , the lunar new year . She would set an extra place at the table . She had just had a miscarriage . It was a bit crazy , she knew , but she was counting on Father to come and rescue her . <p> " Hello , " a woman said . Mother stopped . The woman was toothless . Her hair was in a bun and greasy . <p> " My name is Tai , " she said . <p> Mother noticed her thin cotton outfit . She was sweating . <p> " I need work . I 'm good . " <p> She had trouble in finding words but expressed herself in the simplest ways . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken in her grip , and drops of blood were trickling down onto her foot . Mother reached into her market bag and handed Tai a mangosteen . " I remember , " Mother said . " It was the only fruit worth eating in January . " <p> Tai came home with her , and she carried Mother 's dead chicken . The mangosteen would rot in just a day from a small puncture . She shuffled behind Mother by half a step . The two of them readied the house . The next morning , Tai went to the market alone . With nothing but more waiting , Mother took a bath . She remembered an incident when she was young , standing on a stool to peep into the kitchen window . A pile of sweets . Sweets her mother would never offer her . They were yellow . Dusty . She would eat them first before her two sisters and as many as possible . Her eyes too eager with a plan , she jumped off the stool and landed on a chick , killing it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or make a sound . She thought : I am going to get beaten . She scooped up the chick with her left sandal , ran to the well in the yard , and , in haste , tossed her sandal down into the well with the dead animal . They were her only pair , crusted , flat , barely performing . She could picture her mother seething : the missing sweets , the expense of new sandals . In haste again , she took her right sandal and threw it down the well also . <p> That was funny now . And she laughed in the tub . " When you laugh because no one is looking , you are well , " she said . <p> Father never arrived for the dinner . He was not high up in the military ranks . When I was very young , I thought all men in uniform were important . And they are , I guess , but it did not mean that Father shot anyone or even ran for his life . He was under a much larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do next . Sometimes , he would wait days for orders to come , and they would be simply to stay put . And then he would relay a telegram to Mother , and the illiterate Tai would hand her the news on yellow paper . <p> Father did return three weeks later , with a funny sore on his lip . <p> " A disease , " Mother pronounced . <p> " Maybe he got it fighting , " I said . <p> She rolled her eyes . <p> It was not hard for me to picture Mother horny , and she must have been . We all are , and nights are wasted trying to solve it . I was never afraid of thinking about my parents having sex . Men think about sex every forty-five seconds , and we are bound to run out of material if we do not include our relatives . <p> The next morning , Mother went to the market with Tai . She sat impatiently waiting for her , watching her run back and forth , in and out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could smell it , and she knew if she waited long enough she would know what it was . <p> After washing her feet again and her sandals a second time , Tai finally appeared . She was nervous , Mother said , and she shuffled behind her all the way into Ben Thanh Market . <p> They made a daily purchase even though there was so much food left uneaten . A bag of rice , Mother wanted duck eggs . She sniffed an herb and rejected it . When I pictured Mother going to the market , I did not see it the way you might in the movies . No one screamed , she did not haggle , the prices were the prices . She turned down anyone who offered her anything more . <p> When they exited the market , a man in a cotton outfit was waiting for them . He was sweating . With not many teeth , he smiled at Mother . She became nervous . It was approaching wartime . Every Vietnamese woman started clutching her purse more often . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to speak , he addressed the pebbles . The most amazing part of this story was that no one had to say anything to understand what was being proposed . Mother 's maid had a husband . She wanted her husband to come and work with her . And so the three of them walked home as a group , the man carrying another dead chicken . <p> Tai often wore a white sweater , long arms that weighed her down . According to Mother , Tai and her husband ate the same meal for breakfast , lunch , and dinner-bloody raw fish with rice . It was disgusting . Mother could only watch before she taught her how to catch cockles with a colander from the waters nearby , and so for breakfast , lunch , and dinner , Tai ate cockles with rice . And this was what Mother needed in her life-loyalty . Her husband on one side , her servants on the other , like a set of parentheses . Safety . Outline . Shade . In the beginning , she followed Father from military base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living on the bases-the canned goods , the horrible radio , the endless round of cards , the war brides , the cafeteria lines . Even going to the bathroom felt bureaucratic . To make a dressing room for herself , Mother would ask her neighbor to close her eyes . Usually , the towns she got stuck in were ugly , with two seasons , wet and dry . No birds , where are the trees , what 's that smell , a smothering sky . On a military base , nothing grows . Say their names aloud : Plei Ku , Da Nang , Can Tho , Saigon . Mother never had a real home . <p> When it was time to leave Viet Nam , many years later , it was night . I was six . For the third day in a row , I had rolled underneath Mother 's bed in the middle of the night . I had been sleeping on the floor next to it . I only just remember this : a man , white , in camouflage yanked me out from underneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ever since hated camouflage . I was deposited out in front of our house . Tai stayed with me , her husband darted in and out of the house with Mother . I remember this , too : the sky was orange and the next-door neighbor was vomiting . Mother had one suitcase , packed with our belongings . A sleeve hung out of it like a piece of sandwich meat . Tai said goodbye to me . We hugged . Her husband whose name I never learned squeezed my arm . Then , Mother reached into her pocketbook and took out the key to our house and handed it to Tai . And in one moment , however brief , all the maids in Viet Nam owned everything . It was time to leave . <p>
