WITH SOLAR MAXIMUM UPON US , IT 'S TIME TO REFLECT ON THE ORIGINS OF THE NORTHERN ( AND SOUTHERN ) LIGHTS - BY KIMBERLY BURTNYK // IN THE EVENING OF MARCH 13,1989 , ONE OF THE brightest auroral displays ever recorded was seen over much of the globe . The night sky was alive with activity : dramatically bright streamers of green and red shimmered and flashed while ruffled curtains waved in between . Spectacular displays like this are rare at most latitudes , occurring once every decade at best . The ethereal nature of the aurora has spawned wonder for thousands of years , and on that March night it was easy to understand the fear that must have overcome ancient peoples as they witnessed the luminous battles being fought overhead . Indeed , only for a hundred years have scientists known even vaguely what actually causes the " airy nothings* " that periodically grace the skies at temperate and circumpolar latitudes . However , thanks to decades of solar-terrestrial research , the basics of aurora creation are well understood today . First , solar-wind electrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they spiral along the magnetic-field lines that reach into the Earth 's atmosphere . Finally , they impart energy to the atoms and molecules that they encounter there . Those atoms and molecules shed this energy in the form of a few specific wavelengths of light . This is the light of the aurora . But those are just the basics . The details are sometimes as elusive and tenuous as the lights themselves . Making the Solar Connection In 1896 Norwegian physicist Kristian Olaf Bernhard Birkeland reasoned that auroras usually are confined to circular regions around the Earth 's poles because electrons are directed there by the Earth 's magnetic field . In a stroke of genius and foresight , Birkeland even implicated the Sun as the source of the electrons . Photograph Facing page .

Wildgust , who took this minute-long exposure of a September 12 , 1999 , aurora from Brandon , Vermont , with a 28-mm lens at f/2.8. // Roughly 40 years later , scientists Sydney Chapman and Vincenzo C. A. Ferraro conceived of a complicated auroral mechanism in which electrons and ions emanating from the Sun leak into the Earth 's magnetosphere ( the region of space dominated by the Earth 's magnetic field ) . These particles ( the so-called solar wind ) were then detected in 1960 by the Soviet spacecraft Lunik II and III and by the U.S. 's Explorer 10 . Not long after , fledgling satellites enabled scientists to gain a unique perspective on auroras . In 1963 it was confirmed that auroras are indeed confined to roughly circular rings , each about 4,000 kilometers in diameter , centered on the geomagnetic poles . Since the Earth 's magnetic field traces out an oval region where it intersects the atmosphere near each pole , this insight provided tantalizing evidence for the marriage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just what Birkeland had suspected nearly 70 years before . At a temperature of 5,800 deg Kelvin the Sun 's seething photosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen atoms . Surrounding the Sun is a much hotter atmosphere , the corona , which extends several million kilometers above the photosphere . Hydrogen atoms escaping from the photosphere eventually migrate to the corona , which at nearly 2,000,000 deg K is hot enough to strip the electrons from the atoms that end up there , forming a plasma ( a gas of charged particles ) . Straining against the Sun 's confining magnetic field , this plasma is constantly being shed from the Sun . A " slow " solar wind reaches the Earth with a velocity of about 400 km per second . Coronal holes , solar flares , and coronal mass ejections produce solar wind more vigorously and impulsively . First discovered in 1957 , coronal holes are very large and persistent regions of reduced density , temperature , and magnetic-field strength . The magnetic fields within coronal holes are substantially weaker than those of the Sun as a whole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended , " reaching far out into the solar system . Energetic coronal plasma can escape along these lines , unimpeded by the magnetic-field loops that confine it elsewhere . Coronal holes produce solar-wind velocities of up to 800 kru per second in the Earth 's vicinity . They can occur anywhere in the Sues corona and may last for months . When located near the solar equator a coronal hole can induce an aurora every 27 days as the Sues rotation repeatedly moves it into line with the Earth . Solar flares are also candidates in the solar-wind/aurora connection . Flares are highly localized explosions that result in solar-wind velocities of 1,000 km per second near the Earth . In extreme cases a single flare can release as much energy in a few minutes as the entire Sun does in one-tenth of a second . That 's equivalent to a 2-billion-megaton bomb ! Contrary to traditional thought , however , flares are no longer believed to cause many vigorous auroras . Although flares are potentially significant plasma sources , their transient and localized nature reduces the chance that one will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to affect the Earth . Photograph Auroras from above . Taken on November 8 , 1981 , this image sequence from the Dynamics Explorer satellite shows the progress of an auroral substorm .

Although it is shaped by the incessant impact of solarwind particles , the magnetosphere usually manages to shield us from them .

Eather. // Replacing flares as the leading source of high-energy plasma are coronal mass ejections ( CMEs ) . First witnessed from Skylab in 1973 , CMEs are large-scale events that generate the largest known single outflows of solar material . A typical CME removes I trillion ( 10sup 12 ) kilograms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released ( 10sup 25 joules ) is so enormous that it would take all the world 's nuclear reactors more than a million years to match it ! These gargantuan outbursts result in solar-wind speeds of nearly 2,000 km per second in the Earth 's vicinity . CMEs can occur several times per day , increasing the odds that ejected matter will indeed encounter the Earth . Rules of Engagement The Earth 's first line of defense against a CME 's impending assault is its magnetic field . Although basically dipolar , the Earth 's field is not shaped quite like that of a bar magnet . On the Sunward side , the Earth 's field is compressed by the force of the solar wind . Conversely , on the anti-Sunward side the field is stretched out as far as 200 Earth radii by the same incessant stream of solar particles . The bubble-shaped magnetosphere usually deflects the potentially harmful solar wind . However , if two conditions are met , solar-wind particles can successfully pass into the magnetosphere . First , the solar wind must pack enough punch . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flare , or a CME travels out from the Sun , it piles up against slower plasma that had left before . This produces a shock wave . Because of its unusually high density , this shock wave will impact the Earth 's magnetosphere with great force . The impact causes the auroral ovals to expand and to drift toward the night side of the Earth , making auroras appear at lower latitudes than usual . Photograph Berlin , Germany , resident Thomas Helms acquired this captivating aurora photograph on February 19,1999 , from an especially advantageous location - within 50 kilometers of the Arctic Circle - in Finland . Photograph Breaking and entering . When an energetic burst of solar-wind particles carries magnetic fields opposing Earth 's ( a ) , our magnetospheric shield is temporarily weakened , allowing energetic plasma to enter our planet 's magnetic sphere of influence ( b ) . Often a nightside reconnection event follows , pinching off some charged particles and abruptly snapping others Earthward - spawning auroral substorms in the process ( c ) . Adapted from Guide to the Sun by Kenneth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it encounters the magnetosphere the interplanetary magnetic field ( IMF ) must have a strong southerly component , one that opposes the Earth 's field in the plane of the ecliptic . When this occurs , the IMF - some of which is dragged Earthward by the solar wind - can merge with the terrestrial magnetic field , creating a chink in the Earth 's magnetic armor ( see the diagram on the previous page ) . According to Patrick Newell , an auroral researcher at Johns Hopkins University , " When the IMF is southward , the oppositely directed Earth 's field and the IMF can locally cancel and break the Earth 's field line open . Subsequently the Earth 's magnetic field can connect to the IMF . " But that 's not all . " Since the solar wind is still blowing away from the Sun , " Newell continues , " that magnetic field line gets dragged backwards . Eventually the stretched magnetic field lines will snap back closed , now on the night side instead of the day side . " This merging and reconnection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is believed that reconnection pumps energy into the plasma that resides in the magnetosphere . Even during relatively inactive solar periods , with the help of a southerly IMF the slow solar wind can enter the magnetosphere and drive the reconnection process - albeit on smaller scales . Generally such conditions produce substorms rather than large auroral storms . A substorm is defined by University of Alaska scientist Syun-Ichi Akasofu as " an auroral brightening that spreads in latitude and longitude to cover large distances . ' Many visually detected auroras are actually generated by substorms , explains Newell . But if an aurora also produces a significant change ( hundreds of nanoteslas ) in magnetometer readings on the surface of the Earth , it is attributed to an auroral storm . ( The March 1989 event was a particularly intense auroral storm . ) Substorms can happen every two to three hours , while auroral storms happen only once per month or thereabouts . Substorms are thought to contribute to the heating and acceleration of particles that eventually produce full-fledged storms . Loading the Gun The penuitimate steps in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100,000 km , where the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field first encounter the magnetosphere . As noted above , upon impact the solar wind compresses the magnetosphere and the south-pointing IMF merges with the Earth 's magnetic field , allowing solar-wind plasma to enter . Contrary to what you might have imagined , the solar wind does n't then stream directly toward the Earth 's magnetic poles to cause an aurora . Rather , the solar-wind plasma mixes with charged particles from the Earth 's ionosphere , and some of this mixture makes its way to the plasma sheet , a flat , charge-filled region on Earth 's night side that ultimately fuels all auroras . According to Newell , how material reaches the plasma sheet is still a matter of much debate . What is known is that plasmasheet particles are more energetic than those in the " raw " plasma supplied by the outer magnetosphere . " Both solarwind and ionosphere plasma are very cold and low-energy compared to the energy involved in auroras , " explains Newell . " An auroral electron may have a kinetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be 2 or 3 electron volts * " Just how do you turn 2 electron volts into 10,000 ? According to Newell , the merging and reconnection process is responsible . En route to the plasma sheet , electrons gain significant amounts of energy when magnetic field lines reconnect . In fact , without being accelerated by this reconnection process , solar-wind plasma would not be energetic enough to induce vigorous auroras . More important , merging and reconnection also induce superstrong electric fields within the magnetosphere . These electric fields drive the plasma into the Earth 's atmosphere , where auroras are finally produced . Photograph Two favorites of skywatchers , auroras and comets both owe their appearance in part to interplanetary magnetic fields and solar-wind plasma . Left . Comet Hyakutake ( C/1996 132 ) graced David E. Cartier Sr 's view of multiple auroral arcs from Tok , Alaska . Right . Comet Hale-Bopp ( C/1995 01 ) stood up against both moonlight and auroral skyglow when Michael Klensch captured these bands from Alaska 's Denali National Park . // Taking the Plunge Once the plasma sheet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of time before an aurora is triggered . When an energetic burst of solar particles impinges upon the magnetosphere , it compresses the plasma sheet . This pinching forces neighboring field lines with opposing polarities to connect within the plasma sheet . The intense electric fields that have been created in the magnetosphere by the reconnection process are also created by this new " short circuit . " The result ? A glut of highly energized plasma-sheet particles suddenly rushes toward the auroral ovals . The final acceleration of the auroral electrons occurs between the altitudes of about 15,000 km and 3,000 km . The electrons and ions ejected by the plasma sheet spiral inward toward the Earth 's magnetic poles . ( The northern magnetic pole is located in northeastern Canada at longitude 105 deg W , latitude 79 deg N , while the southern magnetic pole is located off the Antarctic coast south of Australia at 138 deg E , 64 deg S. ) The Earth 's magnetic-field lines draw ever closer together as they near these poles . This convergence manifests itself as an increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they follow converging magnetic fields ; some of them get reflected back along the field lines . The depth at which this " magnetic mirroring " occurs depends on the energy of the particle , its angle of approach , and the strength of the magnetic field . Essentially , the more energetic the particle , the deeper its mirror point . And if it can go deep enough , the particle will interact with the atmosphere before being reflected back , contributing to an aurora in the process . Generally , only electrons are energetic enough to reach atmospheric depths where this can happen ; ions and protons are far too massive to achieve sufficient kinetic energy . Thus in most cases only electrons get to excite the oxygen atoms and nitrogen molecules that ultimately light up an auroral sky , though there are rare " proton auroras . " Once the electrons enter the atmosphere the creation of the auroral lights is well understood . Auroras occur between altitudes of 100 and 1,000 km , where electron energies , atmospheric densities , and chemical abundances dictate the intensity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of kilometers high and about one kilometer thick . By far the most commonly recorded auroral color is green . Electrons with mirror points 400 km in altitude will encounter increasing quantities of atomic oxygen , in which case two reactions can occur . This green light ( with a wavelength of 5577 angstroms ) is caused when an oxygen atom is excited to its second energy level above the " ground " state . The atom can remain in this energized state for about three-quarters of a second . This is long enough for the green emission to take place yet short enough for it to occur before the atom collides with some other atmospheric particle and loses its energy that way . When the oxygen atom emits this green photon it drops to its first excited energy level and the situation changes dramatically . The lifetime of this lower energy state is about 110 seconds . Any emission must occur before the ion collides with another atom or molecule in the atmosphere . At lower altitudes , where the atmosphere is denser , collisions are inevitable , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the oxygen ions to return to their " ground " state by emitting a red photon ( one with a wavelength of 6300 or 6364 angstroms ) . This particular red emission can also occur if the original oxygen atom is energized by a low-energy electron . Photograph Taken in November 1989 by renowned Finnish photographer Pekka Parviainen , this view reveals the colors of auroral emissions that form at different altitudes , from 400 km ( where oxygen atoms glow green ) to 1,000 km ( where ionized nitrogen molecules glow blue and oxygen atoms give off red light ) . // While red emissions at high ends of auroral displays are caused by oxygen as described above , less frequent red emissions at the lower ends of displays are caused by nitrogen . At altitudes of about 90 km , molecular nitrogen ( Nsub 2 , with all its electrons ) is prevalent . If an energetic electron - 1,000 times more energetic than that which creates the green aurora reaches this altitude , it can collide with a nitrogen molecule and boost it to its first excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nitrogen molecule can emit as many as four different shades of red light . Other colors besides red and green are also possible . For example , overlapping red and green auroras can produce a yellow glow . Also , at an altitude of 1,000 km nitrogen molecules are ionized by the Sun 's ultraviolet radiation ; they typically lose one electron and hence are written Nsub 2sup + . When solarwind electrons strike these ions , the resulting aurora looks purple or blue . This reaction occurs at the highest reaches of the display . Nitrogen ions can also be found at altitudes as low as 80 or 100 km , and , provided a solar-wind electron can penetrate to there , an Nsub 2sup + particle can be struck and emit a purple photon . When molecular nitrogen between 80 and 100 krn is struck by a sufficiently energetic electron , a delicate pink aurora can also result . Sadly , these purple , blue , and pink auroras often are too faint to be seen by the naked eye . Seeing the Light Even after 100 years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do strong electric fields develop along magnetic-field lines in auroral substorms ? These electric fields drive auroral plasma into the atmosphere . Scientists also wonder what triggers substorms and how particles get into the plasma sheet . In addition , theories explaining the transport of solar-wind plasma into the magnetosphere , even during quiet solar times , are still controversial at best . Last , researchers hope to improve their predictions of " space weather , " the fast-changing conditions in the Earth 's electromagnetic environment . Solving these mysteries will no doubt keep scientists busy for years to come . That being said , the 20th century saw our fear of the aurora give way to appreciation and understanding . And yet it appears that the mythology of our ancestors may not have been far off . For , in a sense , auroras are indeed created in battle : the solar wind is the advancing army , electrons are the ammunition , the atmosphere is the target , and atoms and molecules fall to the barrage of electronic bullets , expelling their luminous life force . If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacular aurora firsthand - if you can . Sadly , much of the world 's population is rapidly losing that privilege to light pollution . But when beheld in all its glory , an aurora can invoke a sense of wonder as grand as the " airy nothings " themselves . Photograph Seeing things from the other side .
