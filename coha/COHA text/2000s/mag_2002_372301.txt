Still reeling from the gruesome murder of Daniel Pearl , Pakistan 's leaders found themselves further embarrassed last week by revelations that the Wall Street Journal reporter 's abduction might have been prevented . It turns out the U.S. requested the detention of the prime suspect , Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh , twice between Sept. 11 and the day Pearl was kidnapped , in each case to no avail . So when President Bush and his spokesman , Ari Fleischer , suggested last Monday that the U.S. wanted Saeed , they touched a handful of raw nerves in Pakistan . By midweek , Fleischer was toning down his rhetoric and indicating that some sort of understanding would be reached . <P> Saeed 's immediate extradition seems unlikely . For starters , the crime took place in Pakistan . Moreover , under Pakistani law it 's illegal to extradite a suspect once court proceedings have begun . But should some legal loophole make that possible , Saeed would still have the right to appeal the extradition  --  keeping the case stuck in Pakistan 's courts for a while . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved . President Pervez Musharraf , who has cracked down on Islamist militancy under U.S. pressure , is reluctant to further annoy Pakistan 's well-armed radicals . Already , police and several investigators have been threatened . An attack on a police bus carrying 20 militants left one dead , and gunmen believed to be Sunni Muslims slaughtered 11 Shi'a worshippers at a mosque in Rawalpindi . The U.S. , for its part , has ample reason not to rush the extradition of Pearl 's murderers . Some in the Administration are worried that forcing the issue would be counterproductive , exacerbating anti-Americanism and offending nationalist sensibilities by suggesting Pakistan 's legal system is n't up to the task . The resulting backlash , they fear , would cripple efforts to hunt down al-Qaeda operatives in the region . Admits a senior U.S. official : " As horrendous as Pearl 's murder is , we have to think long term . " <P>  --  By Unmesh Kher .
