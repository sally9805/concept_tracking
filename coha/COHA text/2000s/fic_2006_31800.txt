Chapter One " We 've got trouble , Boss . " Clarence Hart looked up from the machinery he was working on , his tanned skin glistening in the light of the setting sun . Touches of gray were sprinkled through his brown hair and laugh lines had started to form around his mouth . Though he was no longer a young man , years of hard work had made his muscles rock-hard and he was as strong as most men half his age . In this rough-and-tumble mining community composed almost exclusively of men , he worked shirtless . His shoulder muscles rippled as he stretched , trying to work out the kinks that working in a tight spot had given him . The young man standing before him repeated his statement . " We 've got trouble . It 's Jordan 's bunch . They 're moving in on Shannahan down at the creek . " Hart clenched and unclenched his fists . His blue eyes , usually twinkling with good humor , now seemed almost a flat gray . He looked at the broken-down mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the repairs completed before dark . No matter . The safety of his men was more important than any machine . " How many ? " " Only a few , but the ringleader is one of the new hands that Jordan brought in . The one that wears the fancy holster tied low . " Hart mentally reviewedthe new faces in the area . There were many who could be considered hired guns , brought in by Nelson Jordan . His enemy 's move had left Hart no choice but to bring in some guns of his own . Hart had strength and courage . He had years of working in and around mines that had sharpened his mind and forged his muscles into bands of iron . He could also shoot as well as most Western men , but against a professional gunfighter he would n't stand a chance , just as his men would n't stand a chance . This particular gunfighter would be the one they called Parrish . He was n't one of the best guns in the West , but he was still dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money it took to hire guns that were as fast and dangerous as the ones that Jordan had hired . At this point , it was still Hart and his men against Jordan and his hired guns . The young messenger , Tom Tyler , was barely more than a kid . He was an honest , hard worker . Shannahan , an Irishman just a few years older than Tom , was a former boxer from the old country who had come to the new world to seek his fortune . His other men were of the same type . In a fair fight , they could hold their own . But would they stand a chance against the men that Jordan was bringing in ? Hart continued to clench and unclench his massive fists as Tom watched anxiously . Hart knew that every second he hesitated could bring Shannahan that much closer to death . Jordan had done everything he could that was even close to legal to take over Hart 's claims and meager mining operations . Now Jordan was raising the stakes with the gunfighters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in cold blood , if that was what it would take to make Hart sign over his deeds . Hart also knew that if he stood up to Parrish he might also be a dead man . No matter . He had n't mined and prospected for most of his life , finally finding the best vein he had ever seen , only to lose it to the likes of Nelson Jordan ! Hart would die before letting that happen . The older miner stood , reached for a well-used Winchester . " Are you with me , Tom ? " " I 'll follow you into the pits of hell itself , " the younger man answered . " We all would . You know that . " " That just may be where we 're headed , " Hart answered grimly . " But if so , we 'll go down fighting like hell ! " * * * The sun setting beyond the dark hills cast coppery shadows on the two men riding leisurely down the well-rutted trail . In the distance , sounds of mining machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded out the natural smells of pine and night air . " I 'm not sure I like the smell of this town , " Sam August Webster Two-Wolves said , laughing slightly . " I 've smelled trouble before , but never an aroma quite like this ! " " I 've seen some privies that smelled sweeter , " Matt Bodine agreed , holding his nose with an exaggerated motion . " Still , where there 's mining , there 's sure to be someplace for a beer . We 've been riding long enough . I could handle the stink for a cool beer and a good card game . " " Ever the philosopher , Sam ? " Matt said . " I did n't spend those years in college for nothing ! " Sam answered . Both men laughed and continued their good-natured kidding . Though they rode leisurely , as if they had n't a care in the world , each man kept his gun hand free . And their eyes constantly scanned the areas on each side of the trail , their ears listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been through many adventures and survived countless fights because of the caution that had become second nature to them and the easy way they worked together . They had learned from experience to always be prepared for any kind of trouble that might jump out at them from the next bend in the road . The closeness of the two men came as natural as breathing for in truth they were blood brothers . In the reddish shadows , the two men looked quite similar , as might be expected from brothers . Each was young , handsome , and muscular , over six feet tall and weighing over 200 pounds . They were dressed simply , in comfortable clothes covered with trail dust . Around their necks each man wore identical multi-colored stones pierced by rawhide in the Indian style . On a first , casual glance , they could pass for full brothers , and had many times . A closer inspection , however , revealed a number of differences . Though both had a wild and reckless glint in their eyes , Matt had blue eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sam 's other features , however , had been inherited from his white mother . Only his cold obsidian eyes , which were occasionally softened with high humor , gave away his Indian heritage . In spite of the different cultures they represented , the two young men were as much blood brothers as if they had the same mother and father . They were joined by knife and fire and the Cheyenne blood-bond ritual brought them closer together than most white men could ever conceive or know . Sam 's father had been a great and highly respected chief of the Cheyenne , his mother a beautiful and highly educated white woman from the East who had fallen in love with the handsome Cheyenne chief and married him in Christian and Indian ceremonies . As boys , Matt had saved Sam 's life . Though his home was on a nearby ranch , Matt had spent as much time in the Cheyenne camp when he was growing up as at his home on the ranch . He was finally adopted into the Cheyenne tribe , thus becoming a True @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Medicine Horse , had been killed during the Battle of the Little Big Horn after he charged Custer , alone , unarmed except for a coup stick . When Sam 's father realized that war was coming and that he must fight , he ordered Sam from the Indian encampment and to adopt the white man 's ways and to forever forget his Cheyenne blood . Matt and Sam had witnessed the subsequent slaughter at the Little Big Horn , though that was a secret only they shared . In the sad time that followed the battle , they decided to drift for a time across the rugged West to try and erase the terrible memory of the battle . Though they looked like drifters , in truth they were well-educated and wealthy . Sam Two-Wolves was college educated , while Matt had been educated at home by his mother , a trained schoolteacher . Sam 's mother had come from a rich Eastern family and left him with many resources , which Sam had used to his advantage . Matt had earned his fortune through hard work and smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipments and as an Army Scout , saved his money , and bought land . Both Matt and Sam now owned profitable cattle and horse ranches along the Wyoming-Montana border . The two men never looked for trouble , but neither did they ever back away from a fight , which caused them to be involved in many adventures . And through their exploits , the two blood brothers were developing an unsought but well-deserved reputation as gunfighters . As Matt and Sam continued to ride , they came upon the outskirts of the community itself . Dozens of tents had been erected , with a few ramshackle wooden buildings thrown in to break the monotony . At one point in the rutted road , a rough wooden sign had been nailed to a post . Toward the bottom of the sign were the words " Silver Creek . " It had been crossed out and a new name painted in : " Jordanville . " Sam pointed to the sign and suggested , " Seems the people of this town ca n't make up its mind about what to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town now , " Matt answered . " Probably is n't even organized yet . You know how these new mining towns are . They pop up one day , and gone the next . I saw lots of these towns when I was riding shotgun . " Now Sam 's keen senses picked up the smell of the river among the unpleasant odors of too many humans in too small of a space and the fumes from the mining operations . The sound of the bullwhip was less subtle . It cracked , and cracked again , piercing through the night . The two brothers looked at each other . " What do you think ? " Matt asked . " Should we keep riding ? It 's not our problem . " " You know how I feel about whips , " Sam said . " Probably the only law here is by the gun . If we ride on in and take a look , we 'll probably get ourselves involved in another fight . " Sam continued as if he had n't heard his brother . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen in his life . He said , " No beast or man should ever be subjected to that kind of shame ... or pain . " " Oh , hell , " Matt answered . " You know how I feel , " Sam said . " I just ca n't ride by and let any man or beast be bullwhipped . " " Yeah , I knew you were going to say that . There goes any chance for a quiet beer . " Even so , Matt smiled slightly to himself , for he felt the same way that Sam did . Without another word , both men spurred their horses to greater speed toward the river , where the nasty sound of the bullwhip had come from . Chapter Two As Matt and Sam rounded the corner , there was still plenty of light to judge the situation . On the bank was a tall man dressed in a broad , black hat . He wore two heavy revolvers in tied-down holsters and was holding a large bullwhip made of shiny black leather . The end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just a few feet into the river , next to a long sluice used to separate gold from worthless rock , stood another man . He was tall and slim . He held no weapon except a shovel . He had been working without a shirt . Several small red welts oozed blood where the tip of the bullwhip had hit . The man with the whip laughed . " Well , Shannahan , have you had enough yet to make you return to the old country ? We do n't need the likes of you or your boss here . If you take off now , I might let you live . " The man in the water said nothing . The man in black waved his whip and laughed . " On the other hand , there 's too many damned Irishmen in Ireland , as well . Might as well kill you now and be done with it . " On the riverbank stood many other men . Some of them wore guns and , like Parrish , had the appearance of hired guns . They laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the look of simpler workers . Some of these moved restlessly from one foot to another , as if they wanted to help but could not . The majority seemed indifferent . Shannahan finally crossed his arms against his chest , one hand still holding his shovel , and said plainly , " Parrish , you 're a damnable coward . " Faster than the strike of a rattlesnake , Parrish flicked his wrist and the bullwhip cracked again . The Irishman tried to use his shovel as a shield , without success . Another red welt appeared , this one on his cheek . The man did n't flinch , however , even as the drop of red started to run down his cheek . " I 'd think twice about calling me names , son , " Parrish replied , grinning broadly . " If I were you , I 'd consider myself lucky that I 'm just using the whip on you . If I really did n't like you , I would 've already had a bullet through you . Probably several bullets . " The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but could clearly see and hear the exchange as they rode . Matt sighed , and said , " It 's none of our business , you know . For all we know , that man in the river could have stolen the other man 's wife . Or worse , he could have stolen a horse . " " You know better than that , brother , " Sam said , through clenched teeth . " We 've both seen this scene too many times . You know what 's going on as well as I do . And even if he did steal a woman , not even that crime is bad enough to be bullwhipped . Too many of my people have suffered that kind of fate . I do n't plan to let anybody be bullwhipped if I can help it . " " Then I 'm with you . " The two men had worked together long enough that only a few words were needed to develop a plan and put it into action . " I 'm going after Parrish , " Sam said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Shannahan briefly touched the blood trickling down his cheek , glanced at it , then turned his attention back to his tormentor . " I speak only the truth , " Shannanan said . " You 're a damnable coward . Come out here and face me like a real man , and I 'd prove to everybody here that you 're not a man . Truth is , you know you 'd stand no chance against me . You act brave up there when you have the gun and whip and I have only a shovel . I 'm calling you like I see it . You 're nothing but a lowdown , razor-backed cur of a mongrel bitch . I suspect that your owner , Jordan , is probably your bastard father ... " Matt had to admire the way Shannahan was conducting himself . Though he knew he could be shot or crippled at any moment , he still stood his ground and tried to anger Parrish enough to make a mistake . It was a desperate gamble , one that looked like Shannahan would lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parrish angrily raised his hand to crack the whip with full force across the other man when unexpectedly he heard a horse racing toward him through the crowd . The spectators ran and jumped out of the way . Parrish looked up in time to see a grim face with dark eyes that were as cold as obsidian bearing down on him . Before Parrish could react , the other man reached out and plucked the bullwhip from his hand . In one fluid motion he threw the whip into the river and dismounted his horse . " Stranger , I do n't know who you are , but you 're a dead man . " " My name 's Sam Two-Wolves , and I think I disagree with your assessment of the situation . " Sam 's cool words , more appropriate to a drawing room discussion than to a potential shootout , made Parrish pause for another half-second . It was enough time for Sam to cross the remaining several feet and connect with a solid right to the jaw . Parrish landed on his rear on the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his pride . He angrily jumped up to face the stranger . Parrish waited for several more seconds . Still nothing , except for some low grumbles . The seconds seemed like hours before Parrish took a quick glance to his left . Another man that looked as if he could be a brother to Sam Two-Wolves was nonchalantly leaning against a tree , his revolver held lazily in his hand , while the other men were carefully placing their weapons in a pile in front of them . A few of them looked to Parrish and shrugged . Others in the crowd were smiling . " You 're on your own now , Parrish , " Matt said . " Let 's see what kind of stuff you 're really made of , " Sam said . " Prove you 're not a coward who needs a bullwhip to try to pretend he 's a man . " Parrish turned back to face Sam . The gunfighter and Sam were about evenly matched in height and weight , but Parrish had his back to the wall . All eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could not easily slip out of this fight . " Well ? " Sam continued . " What kind of man are you ? " Parrish suddenly took three steps and dived at Sam , driving his shoulder into the other man 's belly . The gunfighter had telegraphed his move , however , and Sam had prepared himself by bracing his feet on the ground and tensing his muscles . To Parrish it felt like he was hitting a brick wall . Sam brought down a clenched fist on the back of the other man 's neck . ( Continues ... )
