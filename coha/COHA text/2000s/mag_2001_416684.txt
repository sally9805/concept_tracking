About the time summer gets really hot , coneflowers ( Rudbeckia sp. ) come into their ownlaughing at the sun with radiant flowers and reckless abandon . They 're commonly called black-eyed Susans , a name that speaks of the cone 's color and applies to only a few selections . Others proudly wear brown eyes , and some even don green ones . Invite one into your border , and you 'll probably want others to come along . Photograph Photograph These goof-proof flowers come in all sizes and stand up to the heat . // EASY CARE Coneflowers require little attention , making them a great choice for color in the mid- to late-summer garden . Regardless of the selection you choose , the care is simple and the same . Basically , these stalwart plants require two things . First , they need adequate sunlight . Four hours of direct sunshine is the minimum needed for good flower production . They sturdily stand up to all-day sun but become lanky and weak in the shade . Their second absolute is well-drained soil . Coneflowers enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soggy . They are also fiercely drought tolerant . When foliage wilts from lack of rain , a thorough soaking perks them up and gets them through another rainless week . Coneflowers have varying appetites , depending on the type . Fertilize repeat-blooming selections , such as Indian Summer ' ( R. hirta ) , throughout the summer to maintain flower production . The selections that bloom once , such as Goldsturm , ' require feeding only if the lush green leaves appear pale . A granular timed-release fertilizer works well on all coneflowers with a supplemental liquid such as 20-20-20 applied if needed . Do BLACK EYES The most widely known selection , ' Goldsturm ' ( R. fulgida ) , may be the true black-eyed Susan . Perfect for the middle of a border , this 2-foot-tall perennial remains stocky and upright without support . Medium-size flowers sport thin golden-colored petals in a single crown surrounding a jet-black cone . This vigorous selection requires division every few years during winter dormancy . Another choice is the more voluptuous cousin , R. hirta . A popular selection called Indian Summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black-eyed Susan is short-lived , generally coming back for only a few years . It blooms from seed the first year , and it will self-sow if flowers are left on the plant at the end of the growing season . This selection may require stakes to support the 3-foot stems and heavy heads . Remove spent blooms to encourage fresh buds to form . BROWN EYES At first glance , R. triloba seems to be throwing a wild party where all the guests have small brown eyes and dance on top of tiny petals . There are masses of them , bouncing on multibranched stems , covering gangly plants . This plant could be accused of being weedy , but the sheer number of flowers redeems it . It may grow up to 4 feet tall , requiring a stake to keep it upright . Brown-eyed Susans are also short-lived , but they rampantly reseed when comfortable . Allow the last blooms of the season to remain on the plant ; then cut them back when the seeds have fallen into the garden . GREEN EYES A cool color and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quieter member of this flashy family . Tall and willowy , it bears flowers on multibranched stems and blooms later than other selections . This reliable perennial requires a sturdy support to hold its 5- to 6-foot height , and it brings an airy , striking display to the back of the late-summer border . The mannerly ' Herbstsonne ' does not spread or reseed aggressively , but returns reliably year after year . CLOSED EYES Every family has at least one prissy , frilly member . This clan is no exception . ' Goldquelle ' is a fully double selection , coming from the R. laciniata side of the tribe . The cone is concealed by layers of bright yellow petals , forming a flouncy flower atop a fairly sturdy stem . Even though it grows only 2 1/2 to 3 feet tall , it will benefit from support to help hold petal-heavy branches . Enjoy just one or all of these selections in your garden . A bonus is their willingness to last as a cut flower . A vase bursting with Susans-black- , brown- , or green-eyed-is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are flourishing in your garden , gather a bunch to bring their bright rays of sunshine indoors . Photograph WHAT 'S IN A NAME Many of us have nicknames-a more easy-going or familiar moniker than our formal given name . The same is true in the world of flowers . To some of us , a coneflower is a yellow Rudbeckia . To others , a coneflower is the hot pink number that is an Echinacea . To others , coneflowers are all of the above . You can never go wrong learning a plant 's botanical name . // <p>
