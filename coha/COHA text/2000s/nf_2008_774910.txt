The Art , Science , and // Power of the Poll // Most people think of me as a political pollster , and rightly so . Much of my public profile is tied to politics , especially during presidential and congressional campaigns . But politics makes up less than a quarter of the work I do . The overwhelming majority of my professional time is devoted to measuring and interpreting public opinion for corporations and other business interests and for professional organizations . While voters get to vote only once or twice a year , consumers vote with their wallets every day . // Besides , as different as they might seem , political and consumer polling are pretty much the same thing . In both instances , we make choices based not just on price and value , or promises and policy , but on unconscious signals that we receive and interpret to satisfy our unconscious selves . Business leaders and politicians often miss this essential point . Our minds think in similes and metaphors-we search for comparisons with which we are comfortable to help us understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision- making , good survey research goes beyond simply asking respondents if they prefer Product A or B , or Candidate C over Candidate D. // Good research has to include creative questions that tease out the public 's deeper values and identities , and the questions themselves need to avoid whenever possible charged phrasing that can badly skew responses . That 's particularly true with political polling . As George Lakoff shows so effectively in Do n't Think of an Elephant , controlling the language on key issues gives a party a big leg up in controlling voter response . If we had asked a survey sampling in , say , the spring of 2007 whether the United States should " cut and run " in Iraq , the results would have been far more negative-and far less reflective of true public opinion-than if we had asked the same question in neutral language that included a phrase such as " troop withdrawal . " On the other hand , if the aim had been to manufacture positive numbers for the president , " cut and run " would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that asking questions is only the beginning of good polling : The way you ask them , the language you use , and the effort you make to broaden the connection with those being surveyed all determine the value and ultimately the accuracy of the collective response . Only policy wonks have opinions about HR Bill 313 , but if HR Bill 313 happens to concern , say , the quality of drinking water in exurban communities , just about everyone has an opinion on that . The challenge is to put a question in terms people can understand and react to without losing the reason for asking the question in the first place . // An example : On the Saturday before the November 2000 presidential election , I inserted for the first time into our daily survey of four hundred likely voters the following question as a way of leap- frogging past the horse race aspects of the contest to the underlying motivation of voters : // You live in the land of Oz and there is an important election for mayor this year . The candidates are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Scarecrow , who is all heart and no brains . If the election were held today , for whom would you vote ? // We could have simply asked voters whether on Election Day they were more likely to cast their ballot for someone who was highly intelligent or someone who was highly empathetic . By then , the stereotypes were well-established : Al Gore was a master of policy and governmental detail , but he was wooden in a crowd and on the debating stage . George W. Bush , by contrast , was widely perceived to be loosey- goosey on detail work , sometimes tongue-tied in his responses , but empathetic to the heart 's core . On the surface , the choice was simple : Do you want a president who was the smartest guy in the class or one who feels your pain ? But that 's also the problem with basing questions on stereotypes : They reduce what should be complex answers down to emotional responses to a few simple catchphrases. // Instead , we framed the question in terms of what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man and the Scarecrow . Respondents for the most part knew which stood for which candidate , but now they had an image and a narrative framework within which to consider their choice . They were n't choosing solely between brains and empathy ; they were choosing between two characters found along L. Frank Baum 's famous yellow brick road . By phrasing the question as we did , we both simplified the choice and added complexity . Which candidate did voters want to shepherd Dorothy on her journey through Oz ? And which one did they want for themselves , waiting , somewhere over the rainbow , when the election was over ? // That , at least , is what I was hoping when I came up with the question , and events , as it turned out , agreed . When our results came in on the Sunday before the election , after asking the same question for three days , the precision of the tie-46.2% to 46.2%-told me we were not going to know the winner on Election Day . ( Truth in packaging : I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vice president Monday evening that we would n't have a victor the next day . ) Our seemingly trivial question got at the fundamental image both candidates projected . But the question was about so much more than heart and brain , and about so much more than presidential politics ; it was about the soul of Oz itself . Was that fictional world-and was our real one-to be ruled by reason or compassion , by love or by policy ? And in the end what the question revealed was both how conflicted and divided we Americans were at the start of the new millennium . // That divide would soon get codified into the artificial construct that came to be known as " red states versus blue states " - artificial because a swing of a few hundred votes in either New Mexico or Florida would have turned those red states blue and handed the presidency to Al Gore . I would see both the divide and conflict in starker relief in my own values polling-polls , for example , that tracked how bitterly separated Americans were on the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many of those who opposed late-term abortions believed fervently in a woman 's right to choose . And , of course , we would hear and see the divide and the conflict amplified and exploited in the run-up to the 2004 presidential election . But the Oz question is where I saw it first , in unmistakable form , as if someone had cleaved the electorate exactly in two . // All this from one seemingly innocuous metaphorical inquiry that worked so well because it fit the situation and the people so exactly . When I tried the same question four years later , the Tin Man won by 10 percentage points , a big enough margin to suggest a John Kerry victory over George W. Bush , but as our subsequent analysis showed , by 2004 the premise of the question was no longer valid . The president 's performance post-9/11 had convinced many voters that he had brains as well as a heart . In the wake of what appeared , initially at least , to be a well-reasoned and forceful response to the attack on the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my poll-and as high as 95 in some others-and stayed in the high sixties for well over a year . For Kerry 's part , he did n't project pure intellect the way Gore had in 2000 . In the end , we realized that we had pulled a question off the shelf and tried to recycle it without first thinking through whether the comparisons still fit . // Here 's another example from the world of politics that illustrates what happens if you jump to conclusions and do n't focus closely enough on the details . You might recall that on the afternoon of the 1992 New Hampshire primary , CNN caused a great stir when it hinted at and then projected that the underdog conservative commentator Pat Buchanan was going to embarrass the incumbent President Bush when all the votes were counted . To its great embarrassment , CNN got that one wrong , but it was n't until I got involved in New Hampshire polling four years later that I understood why . // My natural instinct has always been to poll throughout the day , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so just makes sense to me : That 's how you make sure that everyone is heard from-the late shift and the early one , night owls and day people . All-day calling also leaves you time to redial the people you missed the first time around . Back then , though , the idea ran against conventional wisdom . Polling was basically a two-tier affair : exit surveys earlier in the day and dinner-hour calling when everyone was presumed to be back home . In fact , my upstart round-the-clock polling was so controversial that ABC News refused to air my results . I knew I was right , though , and , sure enough , come primary-election day , Buchan- an 's voters once again showed up disproportionately early at the polls and skewed the numbers for other pollsters who were relying on traditional methods to make their projections . // I saw the same thing in the 2000 primaries with the younger Bush and John McCain , and in New Hampshire again in 2004 with Howard Dean and John Kerry . In state after state , McCain would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come surging back after five or six o'clock . In New Hampshire , Dean appeared to have picked up so much momentum by midafternoon that NBC News was about to wring my neck for insisting the race was still close , but I knew Kerry 's voters were going to come out in droves late in the afternoon and in early evening . We had tons of pre-election data showing his numbers spiked after five p.m. , and that is exactly what happened . That 's why , to this day , we annoy the public by calling all day long . // From Red State vs . Blue State to Wal-Mart vs . Macy 's : // Where We Shop Is How We Vote // Annoying , in fact , is probably what pollsters do best , but until you ask the question , you ca n't find that kernel of truth , and until you chew the kernel , you ca n't begin to know what 's inside . A few years back , I made a big splash by identifying a new conservative political majority emerging among Wal-Mart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with majority anything , other than majority shopping ? Quite a lot , actually . Where we shop says a lot about how we vote , who we admire , and what we believe in. // Our polling shows that weekly Wal-Mart shoppers , about a fifth of all those who shop at the store , are far more likely than those who never shop at the retail giant to : be Hispanic , live in a rural area , attend church at least once a week , and-the greatest point of distinction-identify themselves as either conservative or very conservative . In 2004 , when John Kerry lost the popular vote by only 3 percent , he lost among weekly Wal-Mart shoppers by a whopping 76 percent to 24 percent . Meanwhile , those who told us they " never " shop at Wal-Mart went just the opposite direction , voting 80 percent for Kerry and 18 percent for Bush . // Even when President Bush 's popularity began to slide generally with the populace , it held firm with Wal-Mart 's core shopper base . In 2005 , when only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president , 65 percent of the retail giant 's most frequent shoppers told us they approved of the way he was leading the nation . Starting in the summer of 2005 , all that began to change . As the president 's approval ratings were slipping into the thirties with the electorate generally , he gradually fell under 50 percent with frequent Wal-Mart shoppers and ultimately into the low forties . To me , that was a far more telling indicator than any other polling numbers that Bush was losing the American people-including much of his own core . // " Retail politics , " in fact , can be taken literally as well as figuratively . If you want to carry your message to liberals , think Filene 's with a liberal-conservative ratio of 51-29 , Bloomingdale 's ( 48-26 ) , Macy 's ( 42-32 ) , Neiman Marcus ( 39-30 ) , and Target ( 39-36 ) . After Wal-Mart , conservatives prefer Sears ( 16-57 ) , JCPenney ( 21-50 ) , Kohl 's ( 23-50 ) , Boscov 's ( 26-53 ) , and Kaufmann 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macy 's . If it 's a perfect balance you 're seeking , Marshalls is the place . I found that 34 percent of Marshalls customers lean liberal and 35 percent conservative , with the rest undecided or independent . These political alignments with particular stores are so consistent that I 've come to think of retail locations as a cluster of mini-precincts-and these mini-precincts are very definitive marketing opportunities . // Shopping destinations , it turns out , are equally as useful as predictors of political leanings as the red state-blue state paradigm and ultimately may prove more effective . I have a far easier time envisioning a " red " state such as Virginia or Colorado or Florida going " blue " in 2008-or a " blue " one like New York going " red " had Rudy Giuliani gotten the Republican nomination-than I do Wal-Mart voters deserting the GOP despite their current disenchantment with George W. Bush . Indeed , I have a not-so-far-fetched vision of a time in the near future when election night TV maps will be peppered with store logos , and instead of swooning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which way Target and Kohl 's have fallen . I have an even clearer vision of candidates making media buys not through TV or radio stations , but through store catalogs . Why not take the ad where the swing voters are shopping ? // Equally , the political leanings and related sociological background of store shoppers tell us enormous amounts about what will move off the shelves and which products will sit forever . Remember when Wal- Mart tried to launch its designer label line ? The thinking was obvious-there 's no point losing sales to label-conscious shoppers when volume guarantees you can undercut the competition 's price-and it was obviously wrong . People do n't shop at Wal-Mart out of snob appeal . That 's for limousine liberals and Wall Street conservatives . They shop there for the breadth of offering ( everything from foodstuffs to prescriptions to ammo and beach balls ) and because Wal- Mart knocks down underwear that normally costs $5.97 to $2.95 . Forget that populist appeal , and you 've forgotten everything that matters . So definitive are these retail affinities and loyalties that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found myself wondering if the New York-based retailer was as interested in broadening its ideological base as it was in strengthening a thin regional presence . // From Red Skelton to Richard Pryor : What a Good Laugh Says // As a pollster , I believe in casting the broadest possible net because you never know where an answer might be hiding , and I believe in parsing the data that comes in to the nth degree and looking for unusual connections , because sometimes it 's in the strange crevices where interesting truths begin to emerge . A case in point : Back in December 2006 , in surveying for AOL , we threw in almost as an afterthought the following item : //
