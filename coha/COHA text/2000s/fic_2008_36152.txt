After a solid year of visits to the clinic , Sarah was starting to find the decor annoying . Maybe the experts here believed earth tones had a soothing effect on anxious , aspiring parents . Or perhaps that the cheery burble of a wall fountain might cause an infertile woman to spontaneously drop an egg like an overly productive laying hen . Or even that the soft shimmer of brass chimes could induce a wandering sperm to find its way home like a heat-seeking missile . <p> The post-procedure period , lying flat on her back with her hips elevated , was starting to feel like forever . It was no longer standard practice to wait after insemination but many women , Sarah included , were superstitious . They needed all the help they could get , even from gravity itself . <p> There was a quiet tap on the door , then she heard it swish open . <p> " How are we doing ? " asked Frank , the nurse-practitioner . Frank had a shaved head , a soul patch and a single earring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Clean showing his nurturing side . <p> " Hoping it is a ' we ' this time , " she said , propping her hands behind her head . <p> His smile made Sarah want to cry . " Any cramps ? " <p> " No more than usual . " She lay quietly on the cushioned , sterile-draped exam table while he checked her temperature and recorded the time . <p> She turned her head to the side . From this perspective , she could see her belongings neatly lined up on the shelf in the adjacent dressing room : her cinnamon-colored handbag from Smythson of Bond Street , designer clothes , butter-soft boots set carefully against the wall . Her mobile phone , programmed to dial her husband with one touch , or even a voice command . <p> Looking at all this abundance , she saw the trappings of a woman who was cared for . Provided for . Perhaps-no , definitely-spoiled . Yet instead of feeling pampered and special , she simply feltold . Like middle-aged , instead of still in her twenties , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still living with their boyfriends in garrets furnished with milk crates and unpainted planks . She should n't envy them , but sometimes she could n't help herself . <p> For no good reason , Sarah felt defensive and vaguely guilty for going through the expensive therapies . " It 's not me , " she wanted to explain to perfect strangers . " There 's not a thing wrong with my fertility . " <p> When she and Jack decided to seek help getting pregnant , she went on Clomid just to give Mother Nature a hand . At first it seemed crazy to treat her perfectly healthy body as if there were something wrong with it , but by now she was used to the meds , the cramps , the transvaginal ultrasounds , the blood testsand the crushing disappointment each time the results came up negative . <p> " Yo , snap out of it , " Frank told her . " Going into a funk is bad karma . In my totally scientific opinion . " <p> " I 'm not in a funk . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm fine , really . It 's just that this is the first time Jack could n't make the appointment . So if this works , I 'll have to explain to my child one day that his daddy was n't present at his conception . What do I tell him , that Uncle Frank did the honors ? " <p> " Yeah , that 'd be good . " <p> Sarah told herself Jack 's absence was n't his fault . It was n't anyone 's fault . By the time the ultrasound revealed a maturing ovarian follicle and she 'd given herself the HCG injection , they had thirty-six hours for the intra-uterine insemination . Unfortunately , Jack had already scheduled a late-afternoon meeting at the work site . He could n't get out of it . The client was coming from out of town , he said . <p> " So are you still trying the old-fashioned way ? " Frank asked . <p> She flushed.Jack 's erections were few and far between , and lately , he 'd all but given up . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow , " Frank said . " I 've got you down for 8:00 a.m . " There would be a second IUI while the window of fertility was still open . He handed her a reminder card and left her alone to put herself back together . <p> Her yearning for a child had turned into a hunger that was painfully physical , one that intensified as the fruitless months marched past . This was her twelfth visit . A year ago , she never thought she 'd reach this milestone , let alone face it by herself . The whole business had become depressingly routine-the self-injections , the invasion of the speculum , the twinge and burn of the inseminating catheter . After all this time , Jack 's absence should be no big deal , she reminded herself as she got dressed . Still , for Sarah it was easy to remember that at the center of all the science and technology was something very human and elemental-the desire for a baby . Lately , she had a hard time even looking at mothers with babies . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Having Jack here to hold her hand and endure the New Age Muzak with her made the appointments easier . She appreciated his humor and support , but this morning , she 'd told him not to feel guilty about missing the appointment . <p> " It 's all right , " she had said with an ironic smile at breakfast . " Women get pregnant without their husbands every day . " <p> He barely glanced up from checking messages on his BlackBerry . " Nice , Sarah . " <p> She had touched her foot to his under the table . " We 're supposed to keep trying to get pregnant the conventional way . " <p> He looked up and , for an instant , she saw a dark flash in his gaze . " Sure , " he said , pushing back from the table and organizing his briefcase . " Why else would we have sex ? " <p> This resentful attitude had started several months ago . Duty sex , for the sake of procreation , was no turn-on for either of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There had been a time when he 'd looked at her in a way that made her feel like a goddess , but that was before he 'd gotten sick . It was hard to be interested in sex , Jack often said these days , after getting your gonads irradiated . Not to mention the surgical removal of one of the guys . Jack and Sarah had made a pact . If he survived , they would go back to the dream they 'd had before the cancer-trying to have a baby . Lots of babies . They had joked about his single testicle , they 'd given it a name-the Uni-ball-and lavished it with attention . Once his chemo was finished , the doctors said he had a good chance of regaining fertility . Unfortunately , fertility had not been restored . Or sexual function , for that matter . Not on a predictable level , anyway . <p> They had decided , then , to pursue artificial insemination using the sperm he 'd preserved as a precaution before starting aggressive treatment . Thus began the cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shore Fertility Solutions and bills so enormous that Sarah had stopped opening them . <p> Fortunately , Jack 's medical bills were covered , because cancer was n't supposed to happen to newlyweds trying to start a family . <p> The nightmare had come to light at 11:27 on a Tuesday morning . Sarah clearly remembered staring at the time on the screen of her computer , trying to remember to breathe . The expression on Jack 's face had her in tears even before he said the words that would change the course of their lives : " It 's cancer . " <p> After the tears , she had vowed to get her husband through this illness . For his sake , she had perfected The Smile , the one she summoned when chemo landed him in a puking , quivering heap on the floor . The you-can-do-it-champ , **26;1072;TOOLONG smile . <p> This morning , feeling contrite after their exchange , she had tried to be sociable as she flipped through the brochure for Shamrock Downs , his current project , a luxury development in the suburbs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Light-foot , EVD . " <p> " Mimi Lightfoot ? " Sarah had asked , studying the soft-focus photographs of pastures and ponds . <p> " Big name to horse people , " he assured her . " What Robert Trent Jones is to designing golf courses , she is to arenas . " <p> Sarah wondered how challenging it was to design an oval-shaped arena . " What 's she like ? " <p> Jack had shrugged . " You know , the horsy type . Dry skin and no makeup , hair in a ponytail . " He made a whinnying sound . <p> " You 're so bad . " She walked him to the door to say goodbye . " But you smell delicious . " She inhaled the fragrance by Karl Lagerfeld , which she 'd given him last June . She 'd secretly bought it , along with a box of chocolate cigars , for Fathers Day , thinking there might be something to celebrate . When it turned out there was n't , she had given him the Lagerfeld anyway , just to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She noticed , too , that he was wearing perfectly creased trousers , one of his fitted shirts from the Custom Shop , and an Hermes tie . " Important clients ? " she asked . <p> " What ? " He frowned . " Yeah . We 're meeting about the marketing plans for the development . " <p> " Well , " she said . " Have a good day , then . And wish me luck . " <p> " What ? " he said again , shrugging into his Burberry coat . <p> She shook her head , kissed his cheek . " I 've got a hot date with your army of seventeen million motile sperm , " she said . <p> " Ah , shit . I really ca n't change this meeting . " <p> " I 'll be all right . " Kissing him goodbye one more time , she suppressed a twinge of resentment at his testy , distracted air . <p> After the procedure , she followed the exit signs to the elevator and descended to the parking garage . Freakishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bring herself to use it . She was already indulged enough.She put on her cashmere-lined gloves , flexing her fingers into the smooth deerskin , then eased onto the heated leather seat of her silver Lexus SUV , which came with a built-in car seat . All right , so Jack had jumped the gun a little , buying this thing . But maybe , just maybe , nine months from now , it would be perfect . The ideal car for a soccer-mom-to-be . <p> She adjusted the rearview mirror for a peek at the backseat . At present , it was a jumble of drafting paper , a bag from Dick Blick Art Materials and , of all things , a fax machine , which was practically a dinosaur in this day and age . Jack thought she should let it die a natural death . She preferred to take it to a repair shop . It had been the first piece of equipment she 'd bought with her earnings as an artist , and she wanted to keep it , even though no one ever faxed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not a very successful one , not yet , anyway . Now that Jack was cancer-free , she intended to focus on the comic strip , expanding her syndication . People thought it was simple , drawing a comic strip six days a week . Some believed she could draw a whole month 's worth in one day , and then slack off the rest of the time . They had no idea how difficult and consuming self-syndication was , particularly at the beginning of a career . <p> When her car emerged from the parking lot , the very worst of Chicago 's weather flayed the windshield . The city had its own peculiar brand of slush that seemed to fling itselfoffLake Michigan , sullying vehicles , slapping at pedestrians and sending them scurrying for cover . Sarah would never get used to this weather , no matter how long she lived here . When she had first arrived in the city , a wide-eyed freshman from a tiny beach village in Northern California , she thought she 'd encountered the storm of the century . She had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois , " her mother had said when Sarah had received an offer of admission the spring of her senior year of high school . " Why ? " <p> " The University of Chicago is there , " Sarah explained . <p> " We have the best schools in the country right here in our backyard , " her mother had said . " Cal , Stanford , Pomona , Cal Poly " <p> Sarah had stood firm . She wanted to go to the University of Chicago . She did n't care about the distance or the god-awful weather or the flat landscape . Nicole Hollander , her favorite cartoon artist , had gone there . It was the place Sarah felt she belonged , at least for four years . <p> She 'd never imagined living the rest of her life here , though . She kept waiting for it to grow on her . The city was tough and blustery , unpretentious and dangerous in some places , expansive and generous in others . Great food everywhere you turned . It had been overwhelming . Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tell which ones were truly your friends ? <p> She had always planned to leave the moment she graduated . She had n't pictured raising a family here . But that was life for you . Filled with surprises . <p> Jack Daly had been a surprise as well-his dazzling smile and irresistible charm , the swiftness with which Sarah had fallen for him . He was a Chicago native , a general contractor in the family business . His entire world was right here-his family , friends and work . There was no question of where Sarah and Jack would live after they married . <p> The city itself was part of Jack 's blood and bone . While most people believed life was a movable feast , Jack could not conceive of living anywhere but the Windy City . Long ago , in the dead of a brutal winter , when she had n't seen the sun or felt a temperature above freezing for weeks , she had suggested moving somewhere a bit more temperate . He 'd thought she was kidding , and they had never spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your dream house , " Jack had promised her when they got engaged . " You 'll learn to love the city , you 'll see . " <p> She loved him . The jury was still out on Chicago . <p> His cancer-that had been a surprise , too . They had made it through , she reminded herself every single day . But the disease had changed them both . <p> Chicago itself was a city of change . It had burned to the ground back in 1871 . Families had been separated by the wind-driven fire-storm that left nothing but charred timber and ash in its wake . People torn from their loved ones posted desperate letters and notices everywhere , determined to find their way back to each other . <p> Sarah pictured herself and Jack stepping gingerly through the smoldering ruins as they tried to make their way back to each other . They were refugees of another kind of disaster . Survivors of cancer . <p> Her front tire sank into a pothole . The jolt sent an eruption of mud-colored slush across the windshield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A glance in the mirror revealed that the fax machine had done a swan dive to the floor . " Lovely , " she muttered . " Just swell . " She pressed the wiper fluid wand , but the ducts sputtered out only an impotent trickle . The warning light blinked Empty . <p> Traffic crawled in a miserable stream northward . Stuck at a stoplight for the third cycle , Sarah thumped the steering wheel with the heel of her hand . " I do n't have to sit in traffic , " she said . " I 'm self-employed . I might even be pregnant .
