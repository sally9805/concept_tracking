from CHAPTER ONE It was the last day of summer . Hero Netherfield stretched across the quilted bedspread in her sister 's room , her feet drifting over the edge of the mattress . She was n't thinking about their new house . She was n't thinking about school . She was n't thinking about stepping off the bus tomorrow into a sea of strangers . If she thought about any of those things , she 'd get that old , tight , panicky feeling -- and what was the point ? So instead , she rested her cheek against the soft cotton and breathed . The air was thick with summer smells : lawn clippings and sun lotion and late-blooming roses . She could hear the distant shouts of a tag game down the street . She closed her eyes and made her mind completely blank , as heavy and blank as the summer day . It took a lot of concentration . Too much . After a minute , she rolled on her side and said to her sister , " You got the best room . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angles and alcoves , like Hero 's , but it was bigger , with more windows . Beatrice had hung posters on the sloping ceiling , and they floated colorfully overhead , like the inside flaps of a circus tent . Her sister sat at the desk with one foot propped on an open drawer . She painted her toenails with quick , smooth strokes . " So ? " she said . " It was my turn . " That was true . They took turns choosing bedrooms every time they moved , and Hero had chosen first at the house in New York . " You have a good room , too , " Beatrice said . " You just need to put stuff up on the walls . " " Yeah , I know , " Hero sighed . But what ? She 'd finally opened the moving boxes from her old bedroom yesterday . They were filled with stuffedanimals , seashells , crunched wildlife posters , all the things she 'd collected since she was five . She was n't sure she even recognized that person any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sixth-grader . A little wistfully , she 'd packed it all up again and shoved the boxes in one of the closets under the eaves . That was the strange thing about moving so often . It forced you to think about starting over every time , whether you really wanted to or not . " The only things Hero kept out for her new room were her books and a shoebox of antique bottles she 'd found at a garage sale , colorful glass vials that once held medicine , hair tonic , maybe perfume . The books she wedged into the dark corner bookcase , stacking a pile of favorites next to her bed . The bottles she arranged in a cluster on the window seat , thinking about all the places they must have been , all the hands that must have held them . She liked the way they caught the sunlight and scattered soft shadows of green and lavender on the floor and walls . But the walls themselves were still completely bare . Hero could n't think of what to hang on them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands . " I ca n't believe school starts tomorrow . " " Me neither . " Beatrice fanned her toenails . " But maybe it wo n't be so bad this time . " " It never is bad for you , Triss . " Sometimes it amazed Hero that she and her sister were actually part of the same family . When she was little , she used to suspect she was adopted , an idea that struck her as both upsetting and exotic -- and somehow much easier to believe than the truth . Beatrice was tall and pretty , with wavy reddish hair and an open , sunny face . She always seemed about to smile , if she was n't already smiling . Hero , on the other hand , was small and dark . She knew that much of the time , without meaning to , she wore a pinched , worried look . At the grocery store or the mall , complete strangers would touch her arm and ask sympathetically , " What 's the matter , honey ? Do n't you feel well ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen . After a brief sizing-up , Beatrice would be swept into a throng of would-be friends , girls who 'd show her the restrooms , save her a place in the cafeteria , share their phone numbers and e-mail addresses . They 'd admire her hair , they 'd compliment her nail polish . By the end of tomorrow -- even though it was only her first day -- Beatrice would fit in . Her plans for the weekend would include half the eighth grade . For Hero , it would be a different story entirely . She 'd still be the new kid months from now . She flinched when she thought of what lay ahead : figuring out the lockers , the right clothing to wear , the acceptable food to pack for lunch . Every school had its own customs and fashions , and if she wanted to blend in , she never had long to find out what they were . Hero frowned , thinking about it . It was such hard work , that constant , draining effort to slip into the crowd unnoticed . " Blending in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the difference between camouflaging yourself in the forest and actually being one of the trees . " Oh , come on , Hero , " Beatrice said . " Maryland is almost the South . People seem friendlier here . " She laughed suddenly . " Besides , last year everything worked out okay . You had Kate and Lindsey . " " Ugh ! " Hero made a face . " Kate and Lindsey . That was totally not worth it . " Kate and Lindsey had been her friends in fifth grade . They had identical blond ponytails and high-pitched , unstoppable squeals . Hero had nothing in common with them . It still amazed her that they 'd ended up spending so much of the last year together . It was a relationship based purely on need . Kate and Lindsey , struggling not to fail Language Arts , had to find a third person to help with their Greek myths skit . They chose Hero , who ended up writing the whole play while the two of them huddled together and whispered about their one consuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeremy throughout the school day , without ever actually talking to him , and then spent hours in endless , inconclusive conversations about whether he knew they even existed . In return for putting up with this , Hero found herself with a lifeline of sorts . She had someone to sit with at lunch , to hang out with at recess , to join for team activities in gym . Of course , if the game ever called for partners , it was understood that the pair would be Kate and Lindsey , and Hero would be on her own . " They were awfull , " Batrice said , still laughing . " Remember how obsessed they were with that boy ? " " Remember ? That was my life . " Hero raised her voice several octaves . " He looked at me ! Did not ! Did too ! In Social Studies ! Sideways or did he turn his whole head ? Whole head ! No way ! " Beatrice mimicked their ear-splitting scream . " Remember how Dad always used to forget Lindsey 's name ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ' Kate and the other Kate . ' How could he forget a regular name like Lindsey ? " Beatrice shrugged . " It did n't come from Shakespeare . " Hero and Beatrice were both named for characters in the play Much Ado About Nothing , thanks to the English literature class where their parents met in college . Naturally , Beatrice had gotten the familiar name , one that lent itself to bouncy nicknames like Trixie , or Bea , or Triss . Hero 's name was inevitably misunderstood , questioned , and laughed at . For several months at the last school , one of her teachers had called her Nero . Of course , she had n't told her parents that . Her mother loved Shakespeare , but her father actually lived it . It was his job . For as long as Hero could remember , he 'd been reading , studying , and writing about Shakespeare . When she was little , she used to wake up in the middle of the night to the sound of his voice floating through the darkness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , usually at the dining room table , hunched over the wings of a book , reading out loud . He would always let her listen for a while before he carried her back to bed . The words did n't make any sense -- Hero never understood what was happening -- but the language was musical and full of feeling . She liked sitting in the dim room and hearing the rhythm of it . Her father 's years in graduate school and a string of teaching and research jobs had taken them from Illinois to Massachusets to New York , and finally here to Maryland , where he would be working as an archivist at the Maxwell Elizabethan Documents Collection in Washington , D.C. When the whole family had visited the library last week , Hero thought its stained glass windows and vaulted ceilings made it look like a cathedral . It was filled with books and long , shining wood tables . There were glass cases everywhere , with old , curling brown manuscripts in them . " Dad seems to love that Maxwell place " she said to Beatrice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rumpled and tweedy . " " Yeah , " Beatrice said . " Even the women have beards . It 's perfect for him . " It was amazing to think of a place that was perfect for their father . He was so weird , and not just in the way all parents were weird . He used words like " Fie " and " tetchy , " and he could quote long passages from Shakespeare by heart . He never did the things that other dads did , like play golf or watch football on TV . He had no idea how to grill a steak . But Beatrice was right : Compared to the rest of the staff at the Maxwell , he seemed normal . " Do you think that 's how it is for everybody ? " Hero asked . " Do you think even the weirdest people seem normal if you put them in the right place ? Beatrice thought for a minute . " Are you talking about Dad or yourself ? " Hero grabbed the pillow and hurled it at her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Beatrice said . " I was just kidding . Relax , school will go fine tomorrow . You worry too much . " Hero shook her head . " No , I do n't . When you 're me , it 's not possible to worry too much . " At that moment , their mother appeared in the doorway . She was holding a large pair of pruning shears , and her cheeks were streaked with sweat . From the expression on her face , they could tell she 'd been listening . " Well , " she said to Hero , " I suppose if you worry too much , you 'll always be pleasantly surprised . " This text is from an uncorrected proof
