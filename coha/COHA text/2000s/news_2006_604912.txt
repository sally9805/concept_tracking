<p> Lari White is working her way down her career checklist . <p> " I 'm trying to check them all off , slowly but surely , " says the 40-year-old jill-of-all-trades . Make records for a major label ? Check  --  with a handful of top-40 country hits in the mid- ' 90s . Appear in a blockbuster movie ? Check  --  that would be the Tom Hanks film Cast Away . Go to Broadway ? Check  --  she now performs in Ring of Fire , the jukebox musical based on the songs of Johnny Cash . <p> So where does becoming the first female producer of a male country-music superstar fit on that list ? <p> " That 's right up there in the top five , " White says , grinning . <p> White checked that off her list this week with the release of Toby Keith 's White Trash with Money . The album 's first single , Get Drunk and Be Somebody , already is a top-5 country hit . <p> Though the music industry 's top female stars , such as Madonna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their own albums , few women ever take the step to producing other acts . It 's practically unheard of for a multiplatinum male artist to bring a female producer aboard midcareer . <p> But Keith , who recently launched his own label , has made a career of confounding expectations . <p> " I had heard Lari 's Green Eyed Soul album that she did herself , " Keith says . " It 's one of the best albums I 've ever heard . Her being a friend , I did n't want to commit to nothing . I just said , ' Let 's do a few demos , but bring the A-guys in . If we like something , we 'll kick the scale up and go with masters . ' <p> " About four songs in , it was so good , I knew I was n't going to back out . I just said , ' Master that last song and send it to radio right now , and let 's finish the album . ' " <p> Keith and White cut tracks at The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songwriter Chuck Cannon , built at their home west of Nashville . Since White had majored in audio engineering at the University of Miami , she handled most of the technical details . <p> " I 'd be cross-eyed in front of the computer at 3 o'clock in the morning , doing edits , " she says . <p> Keith 's testosterone-charged persona caused news of the collaboration to raise eyebrows throughout the country-music industry , but the entertainers ' careers have crossed paths often . <p> Music history repeats <p> White has a songwriting credit on one of Keith 's early albums ; they recorded a duet for one of hers . White 's husband co-wrote several of Keith 's hits , including How Do You Like Me Now ? ! <p> " Toby knew it would be a cool thing if it worked , " White says . " If we made a ( great ) record , that would be much cooler than him getting the hot producer of the moment , which inevitably would have been a guy . " <p> Keith says he did n't realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We were about halfway through the project when I went , ' Lari , what other girls are producing ? ' We could n't come up with one . " <p> There are n't many . This demanding job  --  which parallels the comprehensive supervisory duties of a film director , and can involve everything from choosing songs and musicians to supervising recording sessions and editing the results  --  is historically a male province . <p> According to Terri Winston , founder and executive director of the San Francisco-based Women 's Audio Mission , women make up less than 5% of the workforce in recording technology . <p> Historians often point to Bonnie Guitar , who produced The Fleetwoods ' 1959 hits Come Softly to Me and Mr. Blue , as the rock era 's first successful female producer . During the ' 60s , Ellie Greenwich and husband Jeff Barry produced hits for Neil Diamond and the Dixie Cups . <p> Sylvia Robinson co-founded Sugar Hill Records in the ' 70s and produced pioneering hip-hop records such as Rapper 's Delight . <p> " In Nashville , I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White says . " Gail did her own records . Wendy did Suzy Bogguss , New Grass Revival and the Forester Sisters . I have reference points . " <p> Winston says she believes young women may avoid the recording arts because of the way they 're socialized with technology . <p> " Production requires you to be in a studio environment that looks like the inside of an airplane . That 's been intimidating . If we make women more comfortable with technology , I think you would see more women in a producer role . " <p> Rising through the ranks <p> Women with success stories often have come from entrepreneurial environments . Guitar and Robinson co-owned the labels that released their records . Keith just broke away from a major label to form his own Show Dog Records . <p> " It 's hard to rise through the ranks , " says Guitar , 83 . " I made my own rules with Come Softly to Me . And when you have a Toby Keith , you know how much input he has . In show business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make all the difference . " <p> You 'd think there 'd be more female producers , at least in country music . According to Arbitron , 56% of country 's radio audience is female , and the percentage of music buyers is at least that high . <p> " I did n't premeditate this and say , ' Hey , I want to go out and get a female producer , so I can sell to the female audience , ' " Keith says . " I 'm already doing that . " <p> Keith likes having a different set of ears around when he 's recording , however . <p> " Lari 's very jaded with the industry , and it takes a lot to impress her , " Keith says . " So if I come out of the studio after singing a scratch vocal , and she 's sitting there , shaking her head , going , ' That is so sexy , ' then you 've got to think that , somewhere , there are other women who are going to go , ' That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm never going to look over at a guy producer and hear him say that . " <p> White says , " My take on it is he just wants to get on Oprah . He wants to get on Oprah , he needs a chick producer . So he calls me . <p> " Lucky for ( him ) , I know what I 'm doing . " <p> The changes White brings to Keith 's sound are n't dramatic . <p> " I wanted to hear Toby a little more raw , a little more acoustic , a little more rootsy , " she says . <p> She prominently featured a National slide guitar throughout the album and brought in real horns where Keith previously had used samples . For three songs , including next single A Little Too Late , she hired Argentine string arranger George del Barrio , who had previously written arrangements for Michael Jackson , Shelby Lynne and Five for Fighting . <p> " When we finished recording the strings for Ca n't Buy You Money , I ran into the studio , threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says . " The entire orchestra fell out of their chairs , laughing . They were like , ' Well , we 've never seen a producer do that before . ' " <p> While Ring of Fire has White in New York for the foreseeable future , Keith already has recommended her to other acts signed to his label . White hopes that having a Toby Keith credit under her belt will bring more production offers when her Broadway stint is over . <p> She also hopes her success can open doors for other women she knows who have been honing their production chops in their own home studios . <p> " I really hope that we grow as a group , as a community , to include more women producers , " she says . " The talent is there , the ability , the competence , the professionalism , the experience . It takes an ice-breaker , and it typically has to be outside the corporate mentality .
