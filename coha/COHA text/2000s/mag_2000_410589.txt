AND YOU THOUGHT ONE OF THE WORLD 'S BEST PLAYERS WAS SQUANDERING HIS TALENT Photograph // John Daly greets me in his Saturday  --  morning uniformXXXI . Razorbacks T  --  shirt , beltless blue jeans , and tube socks . He might have rolled out of bed in these very clothes . He runs a hand over his stubble ; a goatee appears to be rising . His head has been clipped to a uniform length . His eyes are crusty , narrowing in the sunlight . He would appear to be a mess . " Long night ? " I ask . " Yeah , we had some boys over , " he says . " Playing a little threecard poker , drinking a bunch of beer . Made one helluva mess . " He slips on a pair of shades-the trademark Oakleys , which sit on his face all yellow and loose , giving him a remarkable distance , even at close range . His eyes relax behind the glasses . He is smiling . He 's not big . At least , not like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gained weight since he started drinking again last year , just as he gained it when he quit drinking several years ago , just as he gained it when he started drinking again before that . He drops the weight ; then he gains it back . It 's just part of the ride . He does n't care . He 's remodeling a house in Dardanelle , Arkansas , at the foot of the Ozarks , and , like him , the house is deep in process . A gate but no fence . An expanse of mud lying in wait for heavy rolls of sod . A slab of concrete . The outline of a pool sprayed on the ground in red paint . The only finished element appears to be the driveway , which is dotted with brass medallions , each stamped with the logo of his beloved Razorbacks of the University of Arkansas . " I 'm tearing all this out , " Daly says , waving an arm at the driveway . " It does n't show off the Hogs the way I want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiskers . He 's thinking , reminding himself of something , checking something off a mental list . " I got ta call that guy , " he says . Then he looks at me as if I might be that guy himself . " I got ta call him today . " On the mountainside above him , past the golf course behind him , a gunshot rings out . IF THERE WAS A PARTY HERE LAST NIGHT , if people were drinking and smoking cigarettes and spilling beer , there is no sign of it now . The kitchen is as clean as it can be , sunlight pouring in a column to the sink . The walls of each room are plastered with the memorabilia of celebrity , tracing the tortured path that John Daly has walked since 1991 , the year of his improbable win at the PGA Championship , a tournament played that year on a particularly nasty , notoriously long course called Crooked Stick . He entered as an alternate , a twenty - five- year- old unknown , and won the thing without playing a practice round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good ol ' boy rises on a jet trail of luck , raw power , and determination to claim the title , to trade shots with the best in the world . He gave hope to all golfers , even the outsiders , dispelling the image of the sport as a distraction of the rich . With the lumpy haircut , the beer gut , and the clothes he had paid for himself , Daly represented anything but the golf we 'd come to know . And when he held the trophy over his head , he either swaggered or swayed . From the start , it was tough to say . A reproduction of the $320,000 check he won at Crooked Stick hangs now above a lowboy in his dining room , as do various framed newspaper clippings trumpeting everybody 's favorite John Daly stories-victory and sobriety-recording the scandals in tone , if not fact : Daly emerges from Betty Ford with new focus . Daly sturts , the world again at St .. Andrews . Daly threatens wife , court date set . Daly 's divorce final . Alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wilson signs Daly . Daly trashes hotel room . Wilson drops Daly . Daly sober again . Callaway signs Daly . Callaway covers Daly 's $1.7 million gambling losses . Callaway drops Daly . Daly drinking again . As I scan the wall , Daly looks over my shoulder , taking it all in . " There 's a lot there , " he says . " Do n't you think ? " There 's not one bit of it he wo n't talk about , either . He will win again , he says , this year or next . And as for sobriety , well , the hell with it . " I got tired of showing myself as something I was n't , " he says before we even sit down , leaning against an island in his kitchen , wiping the counter with a sponge in ordered , precise swipes . " Sometimes I would quit on my own , and that was fine . But when I wanted a drink , I wanted a drink . Just like anybody else . It was n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyone familiar with the rehab ethos knows how we 're supposed to deal with this sentiment . Denial is a cruel master , they 'll say . Yea , though he walk through the valley of rationalization . . . I remind him that the Twelve Steppers expect this . He shakes his head . " The worst mistake I ever made was admitting that I was an alcoholic , " he says , " because I gave them all the power . According to them , there 's only one way to go . Now , I either go that way or everybody writes me off . " With that , he lights another cigarette . " Man , I am hungry . " The phone rings and Daly leaves me there , standing among the stories and photos . One thing this wall of clippings shows is that , over the past decade , he has been unable to reconcile the various versions of himself . In one moment he is John Glenn , straight out of the heartland , improbably orbiting the massive , insular professional game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of outer space , and in the next he is Gus Grissom , blowing the door too quickly , losing the capsule , drowning in flames . I 'm looking at a stock photo of Daly , deep in his backswing , knee cocked , club fully past parallel . It is a sight-Daly all coiled up , preparing to lash . It is a swing with its own motto , a swing worth seeing in person . Truth be told , if you could see only four things on the PGA Tour , you 'd want to see Augusta , you 'd need to follow Tiger for a round , catch Arnold Palmer before he 's gone , and watch John Daly hit balls at the practice range . When Daly hits the range , it is a bit like an eclipse . People seem to be afraid to look directly at him , at it-the John Daly event . They judge him , they mutter about wasted talent , as if he owed them the act of tying the loose ends , as if they had a stake in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he works his way from one club to the next , smoothly corkscrewing himself through to his high , limber finish . John Daly is the longest hitter in the game . Says so right here in these headlines . Long John Daly . He 's also got one of the best short games in the world , but he struggles with the putter . He laughs when he plays . Really laughs . He 's also everybody 's favorite train wreck . When Daly finally reenters the kitchen , he 's got a cell phone in the crook of his neck . He 's on hold with his sod supplier , and before this whole interview thing starts , he wants to emphasize that he knows what he 's learned . He wants to get that out of the way . " I 'll tell you my lessons , " he says , tagging his fingers one by one . " I do n't drink and drive . I do n't drink every day . I do n't drink to get drunk . " He grabs a Diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his keys in his pocket . " It 's all common sense . You can figure that out on your own . I read the Twelve Steps . I know the book . I respect the Steps , I think about them every day . " He looks out the window . He 's done for now . John Daly wants to eat . WE 'RE ON THE STREETS OF DARDANELLE in Daly 's black Mercedes . Riding shotgun is his twenty-three-year-old girlfriend , Shanae , a former Big 12 hurdler , who gazes out the window disinterestedly . She 's got a bootleg Milli Vanilli CD playing just for laughs , " I 'm just wearing this out , " she says . " It 's hard to find . It 's not legal . " She has a tired look about her . She wants to go work out , but instead she 's here with us , going for fast food at 10:45 in the morning . In the back , next to me , is Daly 's friend Bud Still , a Buy.com Tour player currently crashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game lately , having botched the Q-school last November , and he 's come to hang with Daly in preparation for the next few months of Monday qualifiers . He has an Arkansas hat pushed back on his head , his forehead bracketed by the requisite Oakleys . They crack each other up . " Two choices , " Daly says . " Taco Bell or McDonald 's . " " Ai n't no choice ! " Bud shouts . " Ai n't no choice at all ! I need a burger . I need a burger bad . " Daly snorts . The road thumps by . Barbecue shacks . Muffler shops . Video stores . Dalyscape . He loves it here . He points to a mountain in the distance . " That 's our famous Mount Nebo , " he says . Shanae perks up . " That 's where John proposed to me . " " What 's up there ? " I ask . " I do n't know , " Daly says . " Fish fries . I believe they have a lot of fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog runs alongside the car , then quits . Photograph A supersize Diet Coke , a pack of smokes , four remotes , and Shanae , Dalys girl friend . What more does a guy need ? // At the drive-through , Daly orders by numbers . " Ones and fours for everybody . " He supersizes all of us without asking . Was there any question ? The kid at the window does n't seem to recognize him or even notice the gleaming car . When I offer to pay , Daly shakes his head . " You 're in my town now . I 'll take care of you . " " That 's right , " Bud says . " This is John 's town . Every bit of it . Just look at it . " That just cracks them up . DALY EATS METHODICALLY , and his burger seems to vanish , bite by bite , in the moments I look away . He 's rambling a little , discussing his most recent trip to rehab , made at the insistence of Ely Callaway , Daly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day . " People say I turned around at the gate . That ai n't right . I went in . I was there overnight . The place was filthy . Right away , patients were telling me they could get me booze , reefer , cocaine . I figured , screw it . I knew what was going on . " The moment he checked himself out of rehab , Daly said goodbye to a reported $3 million endorsement deal , parting with his second sponsor in three years . Six months later , he remains the only proven draw on the PGA Tour , or in any sport for that matter , without a huge compensation package from a major corporate sponsor . Daly shifts in his seat , sucks on his Diet Coke , and casts an eye at the corners of the room . " They took away every choice , even the little ones . It just wore me down . Really , the hardest part for me was they would n't let me have Diet Coke . Cigarettes , yes . Cokes , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least they tried to teach you . This place was the opposite . They said they had their reasons . But I had just had it . People think I walked out because I could n't handle it . I just did n't respect the method . Not there , anyway . " He lights a cigarette , draws on it as if climbing a rope . He glances back at a corner . " Cobwebs , " he mutters . Daly is a gentle guy . Today , anyway . He moves tentatively , as if Photograph Daly 's home in Dardanelle , Arkansas , is a monument to sports and music memorabilia . // he might upset the entire room with a single turn . He 's heavy and hard to stir , and the way he fusses and tidies up around the house is less than intimidating . He does n't mind throwing stuff all over a table-cups , ashtrays , receipts , letters , napkins-but when he stands to leave the room , he cleans up . " I hate a mess , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatnik . Drives me crazy . " Daly wipes the table , then stands at the sink , rinsing . " I tried all those drugs . I took Paxil and Prozac ; they made me feel like a ghost . I did n't want to play . I did n't care enough to practice . I do n't care for those drugs . I do n't see any answer there . " You can be addicted to meat , as far as I 'm concerned , " he says , looking me in the eye and laughing . " Why else would I eat six cheeseburgers a day ? " When I point out that he might be blurring the line between addiction and compulsion , he agrees . " Then there 's a whole lot of compulsion in the world . " He pauses . " Dammit ! I got ta call Rico ! " He excuses himself and disappears into the bedroom for another call . He darts away for these calls so often , I begin to wonder if he 's doing it for punctuation . AT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The alcoholic 's big moment . Okay , I say to myself , here we go : This is when he 'll roll off the cliff . He cracks the can without a flourish , without the standard late-afternoon paean to the day 's first beer . An hour ago , Bud poured me an absurdly large Crown and Coke , and I 've been slurping wolfishly at my plastic cup ever since . I 'm buzzed . " I 'll tell you what , " Daly says eventually . " You boys are going to need some more whiskey . " He holds up the bottle : Three fingers left . He might as well be looking at a rock or a hammer , a brick . No hunger . Bud has told me Daly does n't drink whiskey . I shrug . " Want me to get some ? " " Nah , " Daly says . " Too far . You should n't drive . " Daly sniffs the air , hits on the beer , then digs around in a big jar of Life Savers , roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He snaps his fingers in mock inspiration . " We need to play some music . Do you play ? " he asks me , strumming an air guitar . I know two chords , which I learned one night on a bender and have remembered ever since . " Only if I 'm drunk enough , " I say . Daly laughs , rolling the Life Saver in his mouth . " Do what you can , then , " he says . " " Cause I want to play . " Shanae , however , does n't want to play . She wants to talk . To John . She 's back in the kitchen , clamoring for his attention . It reminds me of a family scene , the kind of moment , littered with contrary tensions and desires , that I play out in the shiny kitchens of my brothers- and sisters-in-law . Every once in a while , Shanae pulls open her robe to flash John . " Do you like this muscle , baby ? " she says , flexing her thigh . Bud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . " Do n't go there . " I 'm filming it all with a digital camera , which I 'm using instead of a tape recorder for the interview . Daly loves it . " That 's a helluva thing , " he says of the camera , taking his eyes off Shanae . " You know , I have a couple of those . " " A couple ? " " They give them away at different tournaments . " He takes the camera from my hand , regards it the way you might regard a geode . " I did n't even know what they were . " He walks out and comes back in after a minute , cradling two cameras and their attachments . Pretty soon , we 're all filming one another-me filming Daly , Daly filming Shanae , Bud filming all of it-and witness to what , exactly ? Four people , a kitchen , a bag of chips . Shanae still wants John 's attention . She pulls back her robe . " Do n't show me that , baby ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to put on a show . " Bud starts fixing the two of us another Crown and Coke . We decide to move to Seagram 's next , since we 're out of Crown . Daly nurses his beer . He wants to play a game . " If I was an animal , " he says to me , " what animal would I be ? " This is an old interview trick , a stupid one , the kind of icebreaker Regis Philbin would ask , only Daly 's got it all turned . He 's asking me about him . But I 'm drunk , so I fuzz up my eyes and take a long look . " A bear , maybe , " I say . He shakes his head . " That 's taken . " " You could be an alligator . " I like that . " Nah , man , they 're ugly . I ai n't a gator . " " You could be a lion , " I say-and it could work , too : the hair , shaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by summer , the low-slung bulk , the whiskers , the huge , broad face , friendly and sad all at once . Daly 's pleased . " You got it ! Chi Chi Rodriguez called me that once . He said , " You 're like a lion , scaring everybody , stalking around . ' I try to think of myself as a lion , bringing down the kill , controlling the jungle . A lion controls his jungle . " He nods . " I control the jungle . That 's the way I see my days now . " Bud echoes an amen , cracking another Diet Coke to mix with the whiskey . AN HOUR LATER , Daly says something about playing cards and I perk up . " I hate to take your money , Tom , " he says . Bud cackles . " You 'll be giving it to him , Tom . He 's good . " " I am not , " Daly says . " I lost ninety bucks last night . That was hard enough . I just do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues of money are totally skewed . Eating 1.7 million at the casinos seems to have hurt him less than the ninety he dropped in Dardanelle last night . But , as usual , he is utterly at ease with his habits and launches into the saga of his gambling , not as a cautionary tale so much as a casino travelogue . He says he started with blackjack , then Caribbean stud , then craps , before finally settling in at the slots , eventually working his way from the $100 to the $500 machines . " Slots are great . You work them for hours , look up , and people are watching you ; you look back down and you 'd never know they were there . The slot machines are like being completely alone , on my own , like on a cross-country drive . When you check your watch , thirty hours have gone by . It was scary how far away I got . " There came a time when he was routinely taking $500,000 markers in order to keep it rolling , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period . " I ca n't do that again . I just ca n't . I have to be like everybody else . Drink the free drinks . Play with my stake . No credit cards . No markers . " Shanae rubs the back of his head . Bud changes the CD . Daly looks at me , squinting . " You need anything ? " he says . He 's suggesting a Coke , an iced tea , something to eat . " You need anything at all ? " Five minutes pass , and then he has forgotten I 'm there . It 's like that with Daly . He seems to care too much one moment and then not in the least the next . That may explain why he 's been able to hold on to so many friends in the mercurial world of the PGA Tour , where spirits rise and fall with each coming Thursday . He bears no grudges and knows better than to run down fellow players . " Everybody is somebody 's best friend " is his refrain . At one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighing deeply at the name of David Duval , who Daly says backed out of playing with him at a team event last fall . " It was just disappointing . My game was coming around . I was starting to really hit it . David backs out , and next thing I know he 's there with Freddie Couples . " " Freddie ! " Bud says . Daly looks up , raises an eyebrow . " Ca n't really blame him , can you ? " That cracks them up again . IT 'S EIGHT-THIRTY . BUD AND I ARE DRUNK . He 's pounding me on the shoulder . " John has done so much for me , " he says . " Nobody knows . People say there 's a king ...... He weaves up the stairs . I 'm thinking Elvis , and then , surprisingly , I say it out loud . " Man , fuck Elvis ! " Bud says , laughing . " I 'm talking about Arnold Palmer . He was the king ! But now , that 's what I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the king ! " " Tell me a story , " I say . " He helps me out . He 's helped me out all along . Money . Friendship . I feel like it 's a blood thing . John 'll let me stay with him for as long as I need . He 'll drive me anywhere . Give me the shirt off his back . You know : friendship . He did n't have to reach out to me . I 'm no one . We 're both crazy about the Razorbacks , but aside from that , I 'm no one . " Daly wo n't hear of that . " Buddha , " he says . " You are not no one . " Bud shrugs . " I know I ai n't no one . " Daly laughs . " Shit , Buddha , I 'm not saying that . I 'm saying you are somebody . Not that you ai n't nobody . " " I got you , " Bud says . When I sit down on the couch , Bud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suck . " He reaches into my shirt pocket , pulls out my sunglasses , and , before I can say a word , snaps them in half . " You need Oakleys ! " He takes the glasses off his head and hands them to me . Daly watches from the couch , laughing . He wants to watch South Park , but he 'll wait , because Bud is so excited he 's shouting . " Now , those are glasses ! Is n't that right , John ? This boy needs Oakleys ! Damned right . " He seems to feel I have been pulled into a brotherhood by slipping on his glasses . Daly laughs , reaches into his pocket , and holds out his own Oakleys . " Here , take these , too , Tom . Then you get two for one . " Being with John Daly on a night like this , in a room crammed with the twenty guitars , the eighty-two signed jerseys , the small studio , and the snaking sectional leather couch , sipping that sickening mixture of Coke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign . Voices rise . Bud hoots . The arguments are routine . The Cotton Bowl . New York City . Sailing versus skiing . We take our sides , inevitably , and argue from the holster of our regional prejudices . I love the Mets . Daly 's a Braves fan , so I prod him about John Rocker . " I know the Braves love him , " he says . " He can really throw it . " He wo n't say anything either way about Rocker 's racist comments . " I ca n't get on him for a mistake . They 'd better not suspend him , not for something he said . " " People forget , " I say , " that you have a right to be an asshole . " Daly rolls it around in his head for a second . " And every asshole is somebody 's best friend . " AFTER AN HOUR , Bud pours more whiskey . " You go , girl , " Daly says to Bud , sliding himself down into the recesses of the couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her on the thigh . " Come on , " he says , " I need you to sing . " Shanae is tired . Daly rides in a gear somewhat lower than most . He untwists a story , begs Shanae to sing , restlessly clears the table with the same low energy that drives like a bass line beneath the chaos . " I ca n't stand a mess , " he says , arm crooked around the bottle of Crown , brimming ashtray in his palm . Whereas he drank the first beer slowly , he wolfs the next one in an instant , thoughtlessly and without passion . He stands , powering up his amps , testing the mikes . He 's focusing on the night , on the music , on setting up the moment . I 'm looking hard at Daly , trying to figure out what this drinking is all about . I see no desperation , no real anxiety , none of the fearful hunger of the inveterate boozer . In the parlance , I suppose he 'd be called a binge drinker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven beers . We 've lived the day like frat boys , shooting the shit , eating McDonald 's for lunch , diving into a bowl of cheese dip for dinner , pop-snapping Diet Coke after Diet Coke . There is no transformation with the first beer , or even through the next five . He does n't up the ante . He does not want to drive . He does not switch to hard liquor . He does n't show any flashes of anger . He looks like the same guy who greeted me this morning . I could easily be spending time with my brother , running down the same subjects-college football , lost nights , women we knew , the shape of the beer gut . The fuel for the night is not booze , it 's conversation . It 's a comforting life here , rife with reinforcement , admiration , and love . Family life . AT SIX-FIFTEEN , I AWAKE IN A HIGH QUEEN-SIZE BED , wedged in a gathering of pillows . Joe Montana 's jersey leers from the wall above , pressed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a pee . Someone has cleaned the house . By now I can be sure it was John , sneaking up early to clear the decks so that the sun might creep in along the proper lines . Standing in his dining room , I read a few of the framed stories , the ones he 's chosen to remember . On the wall , there are pictures of his daughters , Shynah and Sierra . He holds them up ; they wrap their arms around one another ; they reach for him in each shot , sticky or sandy or covered in cake . Each photo of Daly presents a version of the man so entirely different from the last that standing here is like looking at pictures of seven brothers , seven silly men , each of them similar to the one before , each entirely defined by a given trait . Daly trips along the years , sleepy or grumpy , bashful or dopey . A clock ticks loudly from his desktop , a surface littered with crystal paperweights , stacked high with the documents of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready . The crack of dawn in Dardanelle . My head throbs . The sun sets up its scrim in the morning windows . Upstairs again , I prop myself up in the bed and snap on SportsCenter , vowing that at the first stirrings below , I 'll go down , apologize for staying so long , and take my leave . Still , in the classic paradox of the hangover , the longer I lie in bed and the more still I keep myself , the worse I feel . So I close my eyes and sleep . Soon , Bud is at my door , knocking gently , urging me awake the way my son does before I drive him to school . " How you doing ? " Bud says , gentle and funny . " You ready to go eat some biscuits ? " IN THE KITCHEN , Daly sorts papers , ticks off the day 's tasks , the calls he must make , the faxes he needs to catch . His day is a series of memos to the self . When I lumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an olive-tinted glass , wearing the same shirt from the night before . He shakes the cramp from his hand , looks me up , then down . " You ever had chocolate gravy ? " Bud moans , revs the engines a bit . " Oh , yeah ! The gravy . You got ta love the gravy . " Daly smiles . " You got ta come over to have some of MamaLou 's chocolate gravy . " " Oh , MamaLou , " Bud says . He slides his hands in his pockets and smiles . " Nothin " like the chocolate gravy . " We walk across the patch of lawn that separates John Daly from his parents . A hundred yards , tops . Daly trudges ahead of me , like a golfer skillfully outpacing his caddie step for step . Bud hangs next to me . The air edges on frost , but the ground has give . It 's cool , and the morning has a sting of pine sap . Daly points up at the mountain , then back to his house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's water coming off that mountain all the time . We 'll have to put something in here-tiles , I guess . " He pauses there , looks back at his house , dim and muddy in the early light . " My brother can do that . He knows what he 's doing . " MamaLou is not surprised to see me . She pulls me right into the kitchen and offers me a seat . " You boys have fun last night ? " she asks . There 's no chiding in her voice , not even a hint of reproach . Bud lights a cigarette . " Shanae was singing . " " That girl , " Daly 's mother says , " can really sing . " Daly 's father enters . It 's seven-fifty . He holds his hand out as if he 'd been expecting company . " Pleasure , " he says . He is barrelchested and neatly dressed , a name tag on . JIM DALY , it reads . COLDWELL BANKER . John Daly watches it all from the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He runs his finger along the edge . " They just installed this , " John tells me . " Granite . " Bud sways from side to side , nursing his hangover a bit . " MamaLou , I need a Diet Coke . Have you got a Diet Coke ? " She brings him his Diet Coke , opens one for John without asking . She is a tiny woman , and she moves tentatively in her own kitchen , as if something might fall at any time . Daly 's father stands at the stove and makes himself a bowl of watery oatmeal . Everyone except me is smoking . " You do n't have to eat that , " MamaLou says to me , referring to the oatmeal . " I have breakfast all ready for you boys . You ever had chocolate gravy ? " " No , ma'am , " I say . " Never have . " THIS MUCH I KNOW . You open a biscuit with your fingers . You lay both halves on the plate , insides facing up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small pieces and you eat . Chocolate gravy is like hot pudding , only better , and I 'm mopping it up , as they say in Arkansas . Bud is moaning , saying all the right things to the cook . " MamaLou , there ai n't nothin " like this . " He crumbles two hard planks of bacon onto his chocolate-covered biscuit and whistles . He points a fork at me . " You ca n't get this just anywhere . " John laughs . " That 's right . Only in Dardanelle . " He has his yellow sunglasses on , hat knocked back on his head , sweat jacket zipped to the nipple . He looks as if he 's ready to go , but there does n't appear to be anywhere to go . His father pipes in . " You boys practice at all yesterday ? " They shoot each other a look . " It was a good day , " Bud says . " We were working all day . " Daly smiles , waves a cigarette at me . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They echo the old games of adolescence : the furtive glance , the snicker . We laugh as if we 've put something over on his parents . But Daly 's parents are n't biting . " We 'll get out there today , " John says . " You want some more bacon ? " MamaLou asks me . No , I say , but thank you just the same . I sip my Diet Coke . " You have to be curious about John , " she says . Smoke twists off the end of her cigarette and hangs above the table . I grab one of John 's Marlboros and light it , though I have n't smoked since I was nineteen , and nod that I am . She starts the way mothers often do . " He 's a good boy and he knows it , " she says . " But you have to work a little to make others know it . He loves his mother . The two of us spend time together . Oh , yes , we do . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riverboats . I just love the slots . He gets all that from me . The gambling , anywise . I have no problem telling you that I lost $300 on my last visit . " She pauses there to let it sink in . " The rest of it-the golf and drinking , anyway-that came right from his father 's blood , I suspect . " Daly looks out the window to the edge of the course . " You want to play ? " he asks me . I do and I do n't . It 's a nice day , and the course is empty , set against a mountain and lined with the barren winter trees . But I have a plane to catch , no clubs , and a hangover working . I decline . " You should come out to the coast , " John says . " We should play . " His mother encourages me . " You should play . You should go out there and play . He would love to have you out there , " she says , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , is exactly what it has been . " What 's not to like ? " Bud says . " Spending time with John . " " Finish the article , " John says , hammering his cigarette out on a saucer . " And we 'll just play . " I promise him I will and ask for another Diet Coke . " Shoot , " Bud says . " Palm Springs . John Daly . What 's not to like in that ? " A WEEK LATER , I MEET HIM at the thirteenth green on one of the PGA West courses , which snakes through a stack of condominiums like an East Coast bus route . We 've both forgotten our promises . John ca n't play-the PGA wants a photo shoot that day-and I 'm still finishing the article . It feels like years ago , that shiny night in western Arkansas . In the interim , John and Shanae have driven across the country in his van . He never flies , not when he can help it . " Big Tom , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say . We grab each other by the arms and laugh . " I wish we could play , " he says . " But I have to practice today . " So we talk . We 're good at that by now . He lights a cigarette , holds it in his right hand , and chips balls with his left . His caddie , whom he calls Wedge , hangs in the background , collecting balls from the area around the green . Daly hits thirty balls without ever using both hands . Every ball stops within three feet of the cup . This is the short game everyone forgets when they talk about John Daly . The balls nudge one another closer and closer to the cup . He calls to his caddie after holing one from forty feet . " Wedge , " he says , " Bud got Tom pretty drunk the other night . " Wedge just hums . He wo n't talk to the press , not for anything . " I wanted to read you a lead paragraph I 'm considering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him off . That he 'll shut down when he hears it , and then I 'll pack up and go home . In my own clever way , I 've waited until I got everything I needed before reading this , not that I 'm under any obligation to read him anything . I give him my first line . " John Daly is going to die . " He shrugs , continues chipping . " He 'll run his car into a tree or his liver will fail . " I press on , reading him the full paragraph . It is-at this moment , anyway-an absolute keeper . " Someone will beat him to death with a two-by-four . He 'll drown in his pool . You know the list : Lung cancer . Bad kidneys . Heart disease . He 's going to die . He 's wired that way . " Daly shrugs . He leans on his pitching wedge and looks at me . " You gon na say I 'll win another major ? " " I was thinking you probably will . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks back toward the clubhouse , having forgotten to tell me one way or the other if he can live with my idea about his dying . I 'm ready to tell him my next paragraph , about how he 's going to live before he dies . But he 's off the green , heading to the cart . He waves me along . " I 'm hungry , " he says . " You ready to eat ? " <p>
