WITHOUT FAIL By Lee Child G. P. PUTNAM 'S SONS They found out about him in July and stayed angry all through August . They tried to kill him in September . It was way too soon . They were n't ready . The attempt was a failure . It could have been a disaster , but it was actually a miracle . Because nobody noticed . They used their usual method to get past security and set up a hundred feet from where he was speaking . They used a silencer and missed him by an inch . The bullet must have passed right over his head . Maybe even through his hair , because he immediately raised his hand and patted it back into place as if a gust of wind had disturbed it . They saw it over and over again , afterward , on television . He raised his hand and patted his hair . He did nothing else . He just kept on with his speech , unaware , because by definition a silenced bullet is too fast to see and too quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It missed everybody standing behind him . It struck no obstacles , hit no buildings . It flew on straight and true until its energy was spent and gravity hauled it to earth in the far distance where there was nothing except empty grassland . There was no response . No reaction . Nobody noticed . It was like the bullet had never been fired at all . They did n't fire again . They were too shaken up . So , a failure , but a miracle . And a lesson . They spent October acting like the professionals they were , starting over , calming down , thinking , learning , preparing for their second attempt . It would be a better attempt , carefully planned and properly executed , built around technique and nuance and sophistication , and enhanced by unholy fear . A worthy attempt . A creative attempt . Above all , an attempt that would n't fail . Then November came , and the rules changed completely . Reacher 's cup was empty but still warm . He lifted it off the saucer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward him , slow and brown , like river silt . " When does it need to be done ? " he asked . " As soon as possible , " she said . He nodded . Slid out of the booth and stood up . " I 'll call you in ten days , " he said . " With a decision ? " He shook his head . " To tell you how it went . " " I 'll know how it went . " " OK , to tell you where to send my money . " She closed her eyes and smiled . He glanced down at her . " You thought I 'd refuse ? " he said . She opened her eyes . " I thought you might be a little harder to persuade . " He shrugged . " Like Joe told you , I 'm a sucker for a challenge . Joe was usually right about things like that . He was usually right about a lot of things . " " Now I do n't know what to say , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to move away , but she stood up right next to him and kept him where he was . There was an awkward pause . They stood for a second face-to-face , trapped by the table . She put out her hand and he shook it . She held on a fraction too long , and then she stretched up tall and kissed him on the cheek . Her lips were soft . Their touch burned him like a tiny voltage . " A handshake is n't enough , " she said . " You 're going to do it for us . " Then she paused . " And you were nearly my brother-in-law . " He said nothing . Just nodded and shuffled out from behind the table and glanced back once . Then he headed up the stairs and out to the street . Her perfume was on his hand . He walked around to the cabaret lounge and left a note for his friends in their dressing room . Then he headed out to the highway , with ten whole days to find a way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started eight hours earlier , like this : team leader M. E. Froelich came to work on that Monday morning , thirteen days after the election , an hour before the second strategy meeting , seven days after the word assassination had first been used , and made her final decision . She set off in search of her immediate superior and found him in the secretarial pen outside his office , clearly on his way to somewhere else , clearly in a hurry . He had a file under his arm and a definite stay back expression on his face . But she took a deep breath and made it clear that she needed to talk right then . Urgently . And off the record and in private , obviously . So he paused a moment and turned abruptly and went back inside his office . He let her step in after him and closed the door behind her , softly enough to make the unscheduled meeting feet a little conspiratorial , but firmly enough that she was in no doubt he was annoyed about the interruption to his routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was also an unmistakable message , parsed exactly in the language of office hierarchies everywhere : you better not be wasting my time with this . He was a twenty-five-year veteran well into his final lap before retirement , well into his middle fifties , the last echo of the old days . He was still tall , still fairly lean and athletic , but graying fast and softening in some of the wrong places . His name was Stuyvesant . Like the last Director-General of New Amsterdam , he would say when the spelling was questioned . Then , acknowledging the modern world , he would say : like the cigarette . He wore Brooks Brothers every day of his life without exception , but he was considered capable of flexibility in his tactics . Best of all , he had never failed . Not ever , and he had been around a long time , with more than his fair share of difficulties . But there had been no failures , and no bad luck , either . Therefore , in the merciless calculus of organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . " You look a little nervous , " he said . " I am , a little , " Froelich said back . His office was small , and quiet , and sparsely furnished , and very clean . The walls were painted bright white and lit with halogen . There was a window , with white vertical blinds half closed against gray weather outside . " Why are you nervous ? " he asked . " I need to ask your permission . " " For what ? " " For something I want to try , " she said . She was twenty years younger than Stuyvesant , exactly thirty-five . Tall rather than short , but not excessively . Maybe only an inch or two over the average for American women of her generation , but the kind of intelligence and energy and vitality she radiated took the word medium right out of the equation . She was halfway between lithe and muscular , with a bright glow in her skin and her eyes that made her look like an athlete . Her hair was short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having hurriedly stepped into her street clothes after showering quickly after winning a gold medal at the Olympics by playing a crucial role in some kind of team sport . Like it was no big deal , like she wanted to get out of the stadium before the television interviewers got through with her teammates and started in on her . She looked like a very competent person , but a very modest one . " What kind of something ? " Stuyvesant asked . He turned and placed the file he was carrying on his desk . His desk was large , topped with a slab of gray composite . High-end modern office furniture , obsessively cleaned and polished like an antique . He was famous for always keeping his desktop clear of paperwork and completely empty . The habit created an air of extreme efficiency . " I want an outsider to do it , " Froelich said . Stuyvesant squared the file on the desk corner and ran his fingers along the spine and the adjacent edge , like he was checking the angle was exact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . Froelich said nothing . " I suppose you 've got somebody in mind ? " he asked . " An excellent prospect . " " Who ? " Froelich shook her head . " You should stay outside the loop , " she said . " Better that way . " " Was he recommended ? " " Or she . " Stuyvesant nodded again . The modern world . " Was the person you have in mind recommended ? " " Yes , by an excellent source . " " In-house ? " " Yes , " Froelich said again . " So we 're already in the loop . " " No , the source is n't in-house anymore . " Stuyvesant turned again and moved his file parallel to the long edge of the desk . Then back again parallel with the short edge . " Let me play devil 's advocate , " he said . " I promoted you four months ago . Four months is a long time . Choosing to bring in an outsider now might be seen to betray a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you say ? " " I ca n't worry about that . " " Maybe you should , " Stuyvesant said . " This could hurt you . There were six guys who wanted your job . So if you do this and it leaks , then you 've got real problems . You 've got half a dozen vultures muttering told you so the whole rest of your career . Because you started second-guessing your own abilities . " " Thing like this , I need to second-guess myself . I think . " " You think ? " " No , I know . I do n't see an alternative . " Stuyvesant said nothing . " I 'm not happy about it , " Froelich said . " Believe me . But I think it 's got to be done . And that 's my judgment call . " The office went quiet . Stuyvesant said nothing . " So will you authorize it ? " Froelich asked . Stuyvesant shrugged . " You should n't be asking . You should have just gone ahead and done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Froelich said . " So do n't tell anybody else . And do n't put anything on paper . " " I would n't anyway , it would compromise effectiveness . " Stuyvesant nodded vaguely . Then , like the good bureaucrat he had become , he arrived at the most important question of all . " How much would this person cost ? " he asked . " Not much , " Froelich said . " Maybe nothing at all . Maybe expenses only . We 've got some history together . Theoretically . Of a sort . " " This could stall your career . No more promotions . " " The alternative would finish my career . " " You were my choice , " Stuyvesant said . " I picked you . Therefore anything that damages you damages me , too . " " I understand that , sir . " " So take a deep breath and count to ten . Then tell me that it 's really necessary . " Froelich nodded , and took a breath and kept quiet , ten or eleven seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stuyvesant picked up his file . " OK , do it , " he said . She started immediately after the strategy meeting , suddenly aware that doing it was the hard part . Asking for permission had seemed like such a hurdle that she had characterized it in her mind as the most difficult stage of the whole project . But now that felt like nothing at all compared with actually hunting down her target . All she had was a last name and a sketchy biography that might or might not have been accurate and up to date eight years ago . If she even remembered the details correctly . They had been mentioned casually , playfully , late one night , by her lover , part of some drowsy pillow talk . She could n't even be sure she had been paying full attention . So she decided not to rely on the details . She would rely solely on the name itself . She wrote it in large capital letters at the top of a sheet of yellow paper . It brought back a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it for a long moment , and then she crossed it out and wrote UNSUB instead . That would help her concentration , because it made the whole thing impersonal . It put her mind in a groove , took her right back to basic training . An unknown subject was somebody to be identified and located . That was all , nothing more and nothing less . Her main operational advantage was computer power . She had more access to more databases than the average citizen gets . UNSUB was military , she knew that for sure , so she went to the National Personnel Records Center 's database . It was compiled in St. Louis , Missouri , and listed literally every man or woman who had served in a U.S. military uniform , anywhere , ever . She typed in the last name and waited and the inquiry software came back with just three short responses . One she eliminated immediately , by given name . I know for sure it 's not him , do n't I ? Another she eliminated by date of birth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be UNSUB . No other possibility . She stared at the full name for a second and copied the date of birth and the Social Security number onto her yellow paper . Then she hit the icon for details and entered her password . The screen redrew and came up with an abbreviated career summary . Bad news . UNSUB was n't military anymore . The career summary dead-ended five whole years ago with an honorable discharge after thirteen years of service . Final rank was major . There were medals listed , including a Silver Star and a Purple Heart . She read the citations and wrote down the details and drew a line across the yellow paper to signify the end of one era and the start of another . Then she plowed on . Next logical step was to look at Social Security 's Master Death Index . Basic training . No point trying to chase down somebody who was already dead . She entered the number and realized she was holding her breath . But the inquiry came back blank . UNSUB was still alive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to check in with the National Crime Information Center . Basic training again . No point trying to sign up somebody who was serving time in prison , for instance , not that she thought it was remotely likely , not in UNSUB 's case . But you never knew . There was a fine line , with some personality types . The NCIC database was always slow , so she shoved drifts of accumulated paperwork into drawers and then left her desk and refilled her coffee cup . Strolled back to find a negative arrest-or-conviction record waiting on her screen . Plus a short note to say UNSUB had an FBI file somewhere in their records . Interesting . She closed NCIC and went straight to the FBI 's database . She found the file and could n't open it . But she knew enough about the Bureau 's classification system to be able to decode the header flags . It was a simple narrative file , inactive . Nothing more . UNSUB was n't a fugitive , was n't wanted for anything , was n't currently in trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way into the nationwide DMV database . Bad news again . UNSUB did n't have a driver 's license . Which was very weird . And which was a very big pain in the butt . Because no driver 's license meant no current photograph and no current address listing . She clicked her way into the Veterans ' Administration computer in Chicago . Searched by name , rank , and number . The inquiries came up blank . UNSUB was n't receiving federal benefits and had n't offered a forwarding address . Why not ? Where the hell are you ? She went back into Social Security and asked for contributions records . There were n't any . UNSUB had n't been employed since leaving the military , at least not legally . She tried the IRS for confirmation . Same story . UNSUB had n't paid taxes in five years . Had n't even filed . OK , so let 's get serious . She hitched straighter in her chair and quit the government sites and fired up some illicit software that took her straight into the banking industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using it for this purpose . Or for any purpose . It was an obvious breach of official protocol . But she did n't expect to get any comeback . And she did expect to get a result . If UNSUB had even a single bank account anywhere in the fifty states , it would show up . Even a humble little checking account . Even an empty or abandoned account . Plenty of people got by without bank accounts , she knew that , but she felt in her gut UNSUB would n't be one of them . Not somebody who had been a U.S. Army major . With medals . She entered the Social Security number twice , once in the SSN field and once in the taxpayer ID field . She entered the name . She hit search . One hundred and eighty miles away , Jack Reacher shivered . Atlantic City in the middle of November was n't the warmest spot on earth . Not by any measure . The wind came in off the ocean carrying enough salt to keep everything permanently damp and clammy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pants against his legs . Five days ago he had been in Los Angeles , and he was pretty sure he should have stayed there . Now he was pretty sure he should go back . Southern California was a very attractive place in November . The air was warm down there , and the ocean breezes were soft balmy caresses instead of endless lashing fusillades of stinging salt cold . He should go back there . He should go somewhere , that was for damn sure . Or maybe he should stick around like he 'd been asked to , and buy a coat . ( Continues ... )
