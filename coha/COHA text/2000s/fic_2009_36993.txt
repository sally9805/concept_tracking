It 's Amazing How Much Can Change In The Space Of A Heartbeat . <p> <br> One minute , I was alone in the Tysons Corner leather store organizing stock . Rehanging jackets that had been tried on and decided against , or more likely tried on for no better reason than to get me to turn around and reach up to unhook them . It had been that kind of afternoon . <p> And then the hairs on the back of my neck stood up . My first thought was , Oh shit , I 'm going to be robbed . In which case I would calmly and quietly open up the register and let the crackheads clean it out . There are some things worth fighting for , but a minimum-wage job in a mall store is n't one of them . <p> " I want . . . that , " a voice said far too close to my ear . The voice was deep , masculine , and sort of growly . The owner of the voice exhaled and warm breath moved over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished I had n't cut my hair so short . A strange man 's breath on my skin made me feel far too vulnerable . <p> I turned , putting a little space and the brown leather bomber jacket I was holding between us in the process . Now I could see who I was dealing with . His eyes were dark brown lit with amber . His hair matched his eye color and fell just to the tops of his shoulders , although the natural curl made it look shorter . He had an uncompromising expression on features that looked vaguely Slavic , and while he was n't much over six feet he managed to give the impression that every inch was formidable . He wore blue jeans and cowboy boots and a white long-sleeved T-shirt with a Harley-Davidson logo that could n't possibly be warm enough in the dead of winter , even in Virginia . <p> Maybe he really had just come in for a jacket . The hackles he 'd raised coming in did n't lie down , though , so I remained on guard . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved me too often for me to ignore them . <p> " I do n't think it 's your size , " I said , continuing to hold the distressed leather between us . Not that it made much of a barrier , but it was something . " There are more over there . " I tilted my head to indicate the rack . My hands stayed right where they were , at about middle height where they could block low or high without having to travel the full distance either way . <p> He gave me a measuring look and then obligingly moved to the display of bomber jackets . I breathed a little easier when he put a couple of feet between us . <p> " Chandra , " he said , drawing the word out . He lifted a sleeve for closer inspection as he said it . " That 's your name ? " <p> " Says so on my name tag , " I said . I smiled , but my lips were tight over my teeth . I did n't want to encourage any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was alone , he 'd stood too close , he 'd breathed on me , and now he was using my name . That was a good tactic for getting somebody to relax and trust you : use their name . It had the opposite effect on me , coming from him . <p> " Did you know it means ' the moon shining ' ? " <p> " No , " I lied . I knew what the books said , but I was pretty sure it really meant my birth parents were liberal arts students with more romantic ideas than money or sense . They 'd put me up for adoption and stuck me with the name as part of the adoption requirement . Although part of me had always wondered if that was so I could be tracked down eventually . There are n't a lot of redheaded American women in their early twenties with Sanskrit names . <p> " Do you dream of us ? " He raised his head as he asked the question , his eyes intent on mine . <p> " I have lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , preparing to fight or run if I needed to . I did n't like anything about this encounter . " One of my dreams involves making sales and staying employed . Do you want to buy that ? " <p> " I have n't tried it on yet . " His lips curved in a smile I did n't like , even though I had to admit it looked good on him . He looked like he was laughing at me . Toying with me . <p> " I 'm not sure it fits . " He took it off the hanger and put it on . It seemed to me that he drew the motions out deliberately , like he was putting on a show for me . <p> I watched the way he moved , but not because I was taken in by a nice body . I noted the harnessed power in his movements and mentally upgraded his strength significantly over my initial estimate . If it came to fight or fight , I 'd run . I was too likely to lose a physical confrontation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was solid and graceful and he knew how to use his body to advantage . <p> " I 'm Zach , " he said , smoothing the front of the jacket . My eyes followed his hands . The jacket looked good on him . I suspected pretty much anything would . <p> " Nice to meet you . " My tone was . at and unfriendly . The gleam in his eyes told me he was n't discouraged . <p> " Now we 're on a first-name basis . " Zach the stranger took a step forward , and I stepped back to maintain our distance . He quirked a brow at me . " Running away ? " <p> I ignored the question . " Bombers are on sale this week . Twenty percent off . Would you like to wear that out ? " <p> " Yes . " He grinned at me . " I suppose you 'd like me to buy it and leave now . " <p> " You might also want something to protect the leather . " I waved at the counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it 's exposed to rain . " <p> " The cow this came from stood outside and got wet , " Zach pointed out , his lips twitching with what looked like a barely contained urge to laugh . <p> " The cow was n't a fashion garment . " I walked around and behind the register , managing not to turn my back to him in the process . <p> " Already you 're changing how I dress , and we have n't even had our first date . " Zach the outrageous flirt took the jacket back off and handed it to me so I could remove the security tag and scan the price . His flirting did n't reassure me at all . Everything about him screamed stranger danger , no matter how hot he looked in tight jeans and boots and a leather bomber . <p> " Then you 're getting off lucky , since we are n't going to have a date . " I charged him for the leather protector and told him the total . <p> Zach gave me a gold card that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So he had money . That did n't make him safe . It might conceivably make him an even greater threat . Some people thought money would buy anything and enough of it made them exempt from the rules . <p> According to the card , his full name was Zachary Neuri . I gave him the jacket to wear out of the store and bagged the bottle I did n't think he 'd ever use . Which made me even happier about selling it to him . <p> " You do n't trust me . " Zach 's smile vanished as he donned the garment . <p> " Mom warned me about guys like you . " <p> " Then you should have expected me . " He looked so intent and determined as he said it that I had to fight the urge to take a step back . " I 'll be seeing you , Chandra . " <p> After he left I stayed still , focusing on breathing until my heart rate settled down . What was that crack about my mom ? I 'd meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with my mysterious all-records-sealed birth mother ? <p> I finally went back to organizing the stock , but I could n't shake the feeling of being watched . When two other store employees came on and my shift ended , I was glad to leave . I wandered through the large shopping center on a random route just in case I was n't simply jumpy and paranoid after meeting Mr. I'll-Be-Seeing-You . <p> Most guys did n't rattle me , not even bullies . Zach had not been most guys . But I did n't see anybody who matched his height and shape , did n't glimpse a brown bomber or curling hair , when I paused and turned to look around me from time to time under the guise of browsing . So I made my way to the entrance nearest my car and headed toward my parking spot . I walked quickly but steadily , head up , eyes forward , the keys ready in my hand . <p> A trio got out of a car near mine , two men and a woman . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my angle so that our paths would n't intersect . <p> Except they did , because the trio moved toward me and spread out , making a sort of loose net . They were too close for me to safely get my door unlocked and inside , so I turned to put the side of my car at my back and drew my feet into the cat stance . <p> The back of my neck was prickling again and goose bumps marched up and down my skin . I ignored the distraction and kept the three of them in my field of vision . <p> Which is why I saw Zach before they did . He appeared behind them , seemingly out of nowhere , and maneuvered himself in front of me so fast I blinked . <p> " Rhonda . Wilson . Miguel . " Zach nodded at each of them in turn . " Did you want something ? " <p> " Is she your bitch ? " <p> The woman who I guessed must be Rhonda asked the question . I had a sudden vision of Zach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His bitch ? Was she kidding ? <p> " She 's my business and none of yours . " Zach 's answer was flat . <p> " She 's on our territory . " This from the big , bald black guy . I was n't sure if he was Miguel or Wilson . Neither of the men looked Hispanic to me . <p> " She has a job in the mall . " <p> " She should find another one . It 'd be better for her health . " <p> I went cold . Had I stumbled into some sort of gang-related turf struggle ? Thanks , Zach . <p> " I take her health very seriously . " Zach 's tone intensified with threat . <p> " As seriously as we take the insult of your presence here ? " That came from Rhonda , followed by a round house kick that proved she was n't just a pretty face . <p> After that , things happened fast , and moments later the three of them were down . Zach grabbed my wrist , plucked the keys from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside and following me in one uninterrupted move . <p> I scooted over the gearshift and into the passenger seat , my back to the door , my fingers reaching for the handle to open it to jump out the other side . Zach caught the arm closer to him in a grip that was hard enough to hurt . <p> " Stop . " <p> I froze . Then I saw blood on his Harley shirt that had n't been there before . The shirt had a new rip in it . " You did n't zip the jacket , " I said , staring . That was dumb . Leather might have protected him . " Which one of them had a knife ? " <p> " Rhonda . " <p> " And she called me a bitch . " I shook my head and reached out a tentative hand , lifting the shirt to see how badly he was hurt . " Do you need a doctor ? " <p> " No . It was n't silver . " <p> I frowned , unable to process why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference to the severity of his wound . My frown deepened when I could n't find the cut on his perfect six-pack that should have been there to go with the damaged shirt and the blood . <p> " I 'm fine , but feel free to inspect . " I looked up and found Zach 's eyes on me , full of humor and a heat I did n't think the situation warranted . <p> I planted my hand on his bare skin and ran it slowly over every inch that was n't covered by his jeans . Belly , ribs , chest , all of it strong and beautiful and warm to the touch , and none of it marked by any sign of injury . <p> " I can unzip if you want to keep going . " Zach indicated his lap . I took my hand away , let his T-shirt fall back into place , and sat back . <p> " No , thanks . " I did n't know what to think . I still did n't trust him , but he 'd defended me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now it had somehow vanished ? " Who the hell are you ? " <p> " Zach . " He lifted the hand he had n't released and drew it to his lips . He pressed a warm kiss to the back of my hand . Heat shivered over me . " We have a date . " <p> " No , we do n't . " <p> " The moon is waxing . " Zach leaned toward me and brought his other hand up to cup my cheek . I did n't pull away . " It 'll be full in three more nights . If you do n't come to us by then , we 'll come for you . It 's time . " <p> " What , are you in some sort of gang or cult ? " I blurted out the question . " I do n't want any trouble . " <p> " Trouble wants you . " Zach caressed my cheek , trailed his fingers along my jaw , and touched the racing pulse at my throat . " You 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , but no-body likes you coming onto panther turf six days a week . Next time there might be more of them , or they might be quicker . " <p> Zach had been unbelievably fast , and he 'd still been cut . They could be quicker than that ? I mentally kissed my job good-bye and wondered how fast I could find another one . Or maybe I should simply move on . Zach 's implication that others were watching me , following me , and planning to move in on me three days from now made greener pastures pretty attractive . <p> " Do n't try to run . " Zach frowned at me as if he 'd read my mind . " It 's dangerous for you to live apart from us , especially now . You need to come home . " <p> " I have a home . You do n't belong in it . " Not that he 'd be unpleasant to wake up to , but he did seem to be up to his neck in complications . Anybody sleeping next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maybe you belong in mine . " Zach 's lips curved , and then his head dipped . It was more the promise of a kiss than the real thing , a brush of lips , a breath of heat . It was enough to send my heart stumbling and make my blood rush . " Come to us , Chandra . You 'll find us at the place you see in your dreams . " <p> Before I could think of a comeback , Zach was gone and I was left wondering if I 'd imagined the whole thing . Just in case I had n't and there were more people waiting to spring out at me , I climbed back into the driver 's seat and headed for my nice , safe , sane apartment where I hoped there would n't be any surprises waiting . <p> Excerpted from ANIMAL ATTRACTION by CHARLENE TEGLIA <br> Copyright 2009 by Charlene Tegli <br> Published in March 2009 by St Martin
