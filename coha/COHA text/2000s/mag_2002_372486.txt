The Afghan War 's Bloodiest Battle <P> As I read about the battle in the Shah-i-Kot Valley in southeastern Afghanistan , I could not help wondering about American military " intelligence " THE WAR , March 18 . Underestimating the enemy 's numbers and not fully appreciating their will to fight , as well as relying upon local forces to carry out the combat , were aspects of the Vietnam conflict . Going after one or two injured or killed men has been tried in numerous wars , and the result is usually the same  --  more casualties . I 'm not saying that it is right to leave bodies behind , but this obsession with retrieving American casualties is somewhat ridiculous . One can not expect to win a war with a minimum number of casualties . BRETT TYRE Delta , B.C. <P> The cover photo of a U.S. soldier bundled up in the mountains of Afghanistan gave me a strong sense of appreciation for the sacrifice that so many people are making . I am not an advocate of violence or war , but I fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I travel the world , I realize we are incredibly lucky here in the U.S. , and it amazes me how many people try to find fault with our country instead of showing appreciation . No society is perfect , but we sure have a lot to be thankful for . PETER BURWASH Carmel Valley , Calif . <P> I am not a soldier . I am sure , however , that all military leaders would call the battle for Shah-i-Kot a crushing defeat for al-Qaeda . Even if we estimate conservatively that 480 al-Qaeda fighters were killed ( at the price of eight Americans ) over the course of an intense battle , a kill ratio of 60 to 1 is the stuff of martial dreams . Seven of the men died owing solely to our very difficult decision to leave no Americans behind . A redoubtable enemy with suicidal tendencies was routed . This was not a U.S. debacle , and it certainly was n't Mogadishu redux . HARRY JONES Dallas <P> This battle should have been called a massacre . To place troops , no matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grenades to face an enemy in fortified caves was unpardonable . The commanders of the U.S. troops do n't know their military tactics . A small atom bomb should have been used to clean out the rat 's nest of al-Qaeda fighters . I would not be as gracious as some parents who say their son died doing what he wanted to do . In my view , many of these young folks died when they should have lived . GEORGE L. HENSON JR . Plant City , Fla . <P> As a candidate , George W. Bush was opposed to nation building and military intervention without clearly stated mission goals and extraction plans , but now he 's involving us in exactly those things . The Philippines , Georgia , Yemen , Iraq  --  Bush is putting together a war without end . He may not have learned any lessons from Vietnam , but he did master the key one from his father 's last election , and he is determined to see that the war continues until after Election Day .
