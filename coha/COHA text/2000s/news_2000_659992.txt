<p> In the end , the people of Yugoslavia have reclaimed their country . After 13 years of harsh sanctions and isolation caused by the authoritarian rule of strongman Slobodan Milosevic , people took to the streets , backing up their democratic vote and bringing his reign to an end . Yugoslavia 's new president , Vojislav Kostunica , is moving to consolidate his hold on power days after the popular uprising . In a significant boost , the Serbian parliament - separate from the Federal parliament , and controlled by Milosevic allies - resigned yesterday . Parliamentary elections are expected to be held Dec. 19 . Milosevic 's ouster came after people blocked roads throughout the country last week , closed down the largest coal mine - disrupting electricity - and persuaded the military and police not to crack down . Those events continued to reverberate as workers stormed a state-run textile factory in Nis , Serbia 's third-largest city , demanding the removal of managers loyal to Milosevic . Serbs are stunned and still celebrating noisily , since their protests for years were met with brute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push of democracy against dictatorship would result in bloodshed . Instead , as smoke rose above the sacked parliament and state television last Thursday , riot police gave up their shields and truncheons and fled before hundreds of thousands of protesters . Across Serbia , ordinary people witnessed extraordinary moments of change that add up to a defining moment in European history . " Mothers kissed their sons , and husbands told their wives : ' Here are the keys , and there is money , ' as if they knew they might not come back , " says Alexander , an eyewitness to events who did not want to give his last name . From his town of Cacak , 60 miles south of Belgrade , he watched people drive to the capital to protest . " They were determined . It took 10 years , but then they came to Belgrade to do their job . " Clearly emotional at Yugoslavia 's first-ever peaceful and democratic transfer of power , Mr. Kostunica told parliamentarians after his inauguration on Saturday : " To me , it appears that everything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is true when I wake up . " If there is something this nation lacks after all the tests , and after all the suffering , all the hardship , it is peace and calm in the most basic sense of the words . " Kostunica is just beginning the tricky game of consolidating power , though Western leaders vow to immediately end Yugoslavia 's isolation . European Union foreign ministers moved quickest , lifting embargoes on oil and commercial flights yesterday and easing other sanctions . A $ 2 billion aid package over seven years is on the table , and the Americans also want to help . But Milosevic 's legacy of four disastrous Balkan wars - which gave the term " ethnic cleansing " to the war crimes lexicon - a decade of sanctions and impoverishment , and last year 's 78-day NATO bombing campaign , will not be so easily forgotten . The Cacak convoy - 13-miles long and carrying a bulldozer to remove police checkpoints - was one element of the opposition strategy that unnerved security forces and forced the democratic victory . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had no emotion , no adrenaline . They were cool as a cucumber , " Alexander recalls of the first police checkpoint outside Cacak . " The mayor came and negotiated for three minutes , but in that time men with crowbars and hammers pushed two of their vehicles into a ravine . " The police gave way . Important moments also occurred at the Kolubara mine complex south of Belgrade , where more than 7,000 miners refused to work and faced down the chief of staff of the Yugoslav Army . In Belgrade , the scale of the street protest reminded many of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 . At the coal mine , a standoff on Wednesday galvanized opposition supporters and showed the first cracks in police might . Miners had never protested Milosevic 's rule in that way . " I was surprised to see thousands of cars from everywhere in Serbia , there to support the miners and bring them food , " says Natasha Kandic , head of the Humanitarian Law Center in Belgrade . " People said , ' The police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin production without us , ' " she recalls . " Then I asked a policeman , ' What if you get the order to attack ? ' and he said ' Nobody can order us to attack civilians . ' " The prelude climaxed with the mass demonstration Thursday in Belgrade in front of the parliament building . Early on , police fired a single volley of tear-gas canisters , but the crowd did not disperse . Opposition leaders had given Milosevic until that afternoon to concede outright defeat in Sept. 24 elections . But the embattled president was silent . " There were three times more people than ever before , " says Nebojsa Spaic , a protest veteran with the independent Media Center in Belgrade , who was not far from the front line on the parliament steps . The Cacak convoy was there too , with the bulldozer - and their resolve . " I saw that those Cacak people were willing to go all the way , and it encouraged us , " Mr. Spaic says . There were surreal scenes : A boy , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police line and somehow walked along the parliament steps . A dog wandered along also , with an opposition " He 's finished " sticker on his side . Then a man broke through , and from the steps waved everyone forward . " The crush started , and so did the running battle , " Spaic recalls . " They police did not shoot , use water cannons or horses , and they could have . " The action shifted to the nearby state television building , and a gun battle there . Emerging from the smoking building , pro-government journalists were set upon by the crowd . " I saw a TV presenter for Radio-Television Serbia , Staka Novovic , who had presented the 3 p.m. news , " Spaic says . " She had mud in her hair , and so much spit on her face that her make-up had run . Then I understood it was all over . Now we are entering the period of real transition . " Since then , the parliament building and TV station have become an attraction for " tourists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one smashed window to another , peering past jagged glass at aged velvet chairs that escaped the fire , or piles of documents . Among them lie election ballots , all dutifully marked for Milosevic , and presumably meant for stuffing ballot boxes . Milosevic conceded defeat just before midnight Friday , and the streets echoed with the blaring horns and whistles of Yugoslavia 's revolutionaries . But all that mattered to those who visited the ruins was the example of years of misrule . " See , look at Milosevic ! " cried one man , pointing out a pig 's head that had been placed on the burned chassis of a car . The slogan " He 's finished " - referring to Milosevic - was painted in black on the wall behind . Students swept up glass and ash , but a steady stream of people just walked around the building , slack-jawed at what they had wrough . Some picked through the debris for souvenirs . " The system is collapsing , in the same way it did in Eastern Europe in 1989 , " says Zarko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivering a message on state-run Politika television . " ' This is the property of the people now , ' I said when I went into Politika , " Mr. Korac recalls . The managers left through the back door and the elevator was shut down , so he ran up to the 17th floor studio . " There was music , and then all of a sudden I appeared and people were startled - I did n't know so many people watched Politika , " he says . " ' Welcome , this is the new TV . It 's free now , ' I announced , and then left it to the journalists . " The result of all these moments was an unexpectedly violence-free coup , a mixture of both revolution and democracy that toppled a die-hard regime . " This is a weird , strange ending of the collapse of the Berlin Wall , " Korac says . " This was a mutant system , but it was more similar to a communist totalitarian system than a democracy . It was based on fear , lies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are liberated ! We are free ! " he adds . " Do you know how I felt when I learned that state security is no longer taping our calls ?
