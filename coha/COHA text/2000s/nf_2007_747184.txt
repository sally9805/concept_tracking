Flue gas desulfurization is one of the technologies that have helped clear the air . A power plant burning lignite can churn out 600 to 3,500 mg of sulfur dioxide for every cubic meter of exhaust gas . But that potential contribution to acid rain and smog can be taken out of the exhaust before it reaches the atmosphere . <p> A belt carries gypsum , derived from flue gas desulfurization , through vacuum drying . <p> A desulfurization plant introduces a lime solution into the exhaust stream . The lime reacts with the SO 2 to create calcium sulfate , CaSO 4 . As a result , what would have been a pollutant becomes a less harmful substance , which in many cases can be sold to manufacturers of building materials . Calcium sulfate , also known as anhydrous gypsum , is used commercially in the manufacture of cement , plasterboard , and glass . <p> The direct output of the scrubber is a slurry that is mostly water . Before it can be sold , or disposed of in any way , the water needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convey the solution on a belt through a vacuum drying process . <p> A company in Germany , a country that mines perhaps 180 million tons of lignite every year , markets process filter belts designed to carry the gypsum slurry as it dries . The company , GKD-Gebr . Kufferath AG , based in Dren , calls the belts Weave in Motion . <p> According to GKD , the belts are double-weave twill made of polyester monofilaments . Type 2035 has multifilament weft wires . Another version , type 2025 , has staple fibers . Mesh apertures in the belts can be ordered in a range of 20 to 400 micrometers . The company claims the belts have exceptional cross-stability in widths up to seven meters and lengths of 120 meters . <p> The company says that a 3,800 MW lignite-burning power plant in Niederaussem , Germany , has 11 scrubbers working . Two type 2035 belt filters have been running there since the end of 2004 , carrying about 8,000 tons of slurry that are reduced to 800 tons of calcium sulfate every day . <p> GKD says Weave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields , from filtration of abrasives and sewage dewatering to refinement of phosphoric acid and rock salt processing . The company , which describes itself as " an owner-managed technical weaver , " also manufactures Solid Weave filtration and separation media , and Creative Weave metallic fabrics for architecture and design . <p> Dewatered gypsum falls from the belt . Power plants frequently sell the byproduct to manufacturers of glass or building materials . Nuclear Expansion <p> A valve manufacturer in Massachusetts is moving into a newer and larger factory to prepare for increased demand from the nuclear power industry . <p> The manufacturer , Weir Valves &; Controls USA , in Salem , Mass. , is moving its nuclear valve operations to a three-year-old plant in nearby Ipswich . According to Peter McGovern , vice president of marketing , the company has operated at the Salem site since 1917 . He said the company 's market research has led it to prepare for a sharp increase in orders from around the world for valves to fit nuclear power plants . The company expects to begin operations in the new facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet and is expected to permit the company to develop a better work flow than it has at Salem , McGovern said . <p> Weir Valves &; Controls is also preparing for qualification testing required to demonstrate that its products can function properly for the 60-year design life of the next generation of nuclear power plants . Qualification testing for the new nuclear power is expected to include ASME QME 1 , which quantifies valve performance . Testing will include seismic evaluation , wear , effects of tolerance , environmental effects , and aging . The company 's vice president of engineering , Sam Shields , is a member of the ASME QME 1 committee . <p> McGovern , an ASME member , said that the company decided to purchase the site partly because the plant already had heavy-lifting equipment in place . Valves for nuclear plants can weigh as much as 60,000 pounds . The Ipswich plant has a 40-ton crane in its shipping area . <p> Weir Valves &; Controls is phasing out the Salem site . The company makes commercial valves and has moved those operations to North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make valves for the Chinese market . The company plans to keep only its nuclear business in Massachusetts , McGovern said . <p> With the move of the nuclear portion of its business , the company is in talks to sell the Salem property . Staff at Salem will transfer to Ipswich , about 12 miles farther north on the state 's North Shore . <p> Weir Valves &; Controls used to be known as Atwood &; Morrill Co . It was bought in 1990 by the Weir Group , which changed the name in 2000 . Unexpected Efficiency <p> Sometimes an unexpected outcome of a project can have far-flung implications . When a Dutch manufacturer set out to develop a new air-cooled cooler and fan that ran quieter , the company 's engineers were surprised by the improvement they got . The company , Bronswerk Heat Transfer BV in Nijkerk , says that it achieved unexpected gains in efficiency , as much as 20 percent-age points better than the performance of older systems . <p> Since its inception in 1940 , Bronswerk has become a leading designer and manufacturer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include Shell , Exxon Mobil , Bayer , Philips , Unocal , and Texaco . <p> An air-cooled cooler and fan system as they appear In a typical customer Installation . <p> Bronswerk 's air-cooled coolers are used as process coolers in handling oil , gas , and chemicals . Fans range from 2 to 10 meters in diameter and cool heat exchangers that are also extremely large - often as big as a building . While designing a new generation of industrial cooler systems and fans , engineers at Bronswerk faced a difficult challenge : to develop a new cooler and fan and make them as quiet as possible to meet stringent standards set by government agencies around the world to protect health , safety , and cleanliness of the environment . The fan would have to cope with a wide range of environmental fluids and pressure conditions from wind gusts and other sources . <p> Airflow analysis of the system offered additional insight to the Bronswerk engineering team . <p> The engineering team at Bronswerk used a combination of Pro/Engineer Wildfire from PTC for creating the design and EFD.Pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fully embedded inside Wildfire , the combination of the two engineering tools let Bronswerk use a single platform for design and analysis . Flomerics acquired the EFD software when it purchased the German-based developer Nika last year . <p> Flomerics is what PTC calls a Platinum Advantage Partner because many of its programs integrate with PTC 's software . In creating their new design , the Bronswerk engineering team needed to fully understand airflow patterns and compare them with those from older fans . According to Guns Bertels , senior engineer , " Our fans are large . Each profiled cross-section is thick , but tapers at the end to maybe half a millimeter . The numerical challenge of dealing with dimensions ranging from meters to less than a millimeter is enormous . " <p> To make the system quieter , engineers improved the efficiency , but they were surprised by how much potential energy savings they achieved . According to Bronswerk , the company 's new designs achieve up to 80 percent efficiency . The company says older systems can be expected to be about 60 percent efficient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , " Bertels said . " The added efficiency was an additional and unexpectedly huge benefit . Sometimes when you want to improve something , you ca n't just improve it a little bit . " Growing Interest in Algae <p> A developer of advanced technology ranging from unpiloted aircraft to nuclear radiation monitoring systems wants to be a partner in a not-for-profit group 's experiment in growing algae as a source of motor fuel . <p> The company , General Atomics , has opened an office in Carlsbad , N.M. , and said it plans to take part in research to develop biodiesel from algae . General Atomics said it expects to work with a Carlsbad-based organization , the Center of Excellence for Hazardous Materials Management , which is conducting studies at New Mexico State University into methods of cultivating algae . <p> The Center , known as CEHMM , studies a wide range of issues related to reducing the impact of hazardous materials on the environment . In one of its research projects , it has built outdoor ponds for growing saltwater microalgae at New Mexico State 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Doug Lynn , said research began with bench-scale tests of cultivating algae in aquariums at Artesia and has progressed to five tanks ranging from 110 to 1,000 gallons each producing algae now . The next stage of research will use two " closed-loop , raceway-type ponds , " each about an eighth of an acre in surface area , Lynn said . Each pond will be able to hold approximately 25,000 gallons of water . <p> General Atomics , based in San Diego , said it plans to work with the Center to develop processes for growing and extracting oil from the algae . The oil can be used to produce biodiesel , which can be substituted for petroleum-based diesel fuel . <p> According to Lynn , CEHMM does not yet have a contractual agreement with General Atomics . <p> Dave Hazlebeck , program manager for biofuels projects at General Atomics , said the company and CEHMM have been " talking together for about a year . " Hazlebeck is listed as the inventor on a 2003 patent that covers a process to produce fuel from organic material . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Mexico State University 's Agricultural Science Center are the next step in an experiment to cultivate algae for fuel . The research has drawn commercial interest . <p> According to Bill Davidson , General Atomics ' vice president of advanced process systems , " We are very much intrigued by the potential that algae oils have , and so are the people at CEHMM . " <p> Davidson said the office in Carlsbad is open now and is staffed by an engineer from Hazlebeck 's staff . <p> Interest in biofuels has increased in recent years because it is hoped that they can reduce dependency on oil imports , and perhaps burn cleaner than fossil fuels . <p> The cultivation experiments in New Mexico are using brine algae that can tolerate the salty water of the Permian Basin . The ponds can be set on land not suitable for growing other crops . <p> The Basin is the remnant of an inland sea from Permian times , about 250 million years ago . The remains of the sea are locked under the ground of eastern New Mexico and western Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current experiments use fresh water with salt added to approximate Permian water . <p> According to Lynn , the algae " are smaller than a human red blood cell . " They have flagellae , which make them mobile , so they grow in the water and not only on the surface . <p> A paddle wheel , built by a local company , will keep the waters in each pond moving slowly to help keep the algae circulating . Circulation will assure that all the algae in each pool are exposed periodically to direct sunlight for proper photosynthesis . Although most details of the paddle wheel are proprietary , CEHMM said the wheel is made of a composite material to withstand the saltwater . <p> Lynn said that , based on results so far , researchers estimate that the algae can produce 4,000 gallons of oil per acre every year . CEHMM has experimental plots of canola at the agricultural center , and that crop may produce oil at a rate of 200 gallons per acre per year , Lynn said . Soybeans , another crop often mentioned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil per acre every year . <p> The National Renewable Energy Laboratory studied algae as a possible source of jet fuel for many years . Bob McCormick , principal engineer at NREL , said the lab 's research led to an estimate of 1,000 to 2,500 gallons of oil in a year from a one-acre pond . The program ended in 1996 because of budget cuts and changes in spending priorities , he said . <p> One of the key issues not resolved at that time was the technology to harvest oil from the algae on a commercial scale , he said . <p> According to the National Biodiesel Board , an industry-supported group that advocates for the use of biodiesel fuels , the most economical way to convert fat or oil into fuel is to react it with an alcohol that contains a catalyst , usually sodium or potassium hydroxide . The reaction causes glycerine to separate from the oil and leaves an alkyl ester , which is biodiesel . <p> Jenna Higgins , a spokesperson for the Board , said about one gallon of fuel is produced for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Atomics is also participating in a pilot project involving biodiesel for the Department of Defense . The project is examining the practicality of dissolving plastic waste with biodiesel to create an enriched fuel to run generators . Rethinking the Matter of Diaphragm Pumps <p> Funny how engineers can keep improving a well-characterized product . Take the diaphragm pump , for example , which uses the displacement of a membrane to move air or liquids . It has been around since 1880 , but engineers keep finding ways to make it better . <p> A case in point is the BTC series of small diaphragm pumps from Hargraves Technology Corp . of Mooresville , N.C. Hargraves got into the business when OEMs complained that pumps were usually the first component on a product to fail or require service . They not only wanted a pump to last 10,000 hours , but they wanted it smaller , quieter , more powerful , and able to handle hotter liquids . <p> This type of challenge often starts with materials . The diaphragm itself was the chief offender . Conventional rubber diaphragms of ethylene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but began to wear out after approximately 3,000 hours . <p> Hargrnves found a number of alternatives , including fluorocarbon ( similar to Teflon ) , fluorocarbon-reinforced EPDM , and its own advanced EPDM formulation . The advanced EPDM lasted up to 10 times longer than conventional EPDM . It also deformed easily over a wide range of motion , so it could pump more fluid per cycle . " This increased the efficiency of our pumps to more than 70 percent , from 50 percent for most conventional diaphragm pumps , " said the Hargraves business development director , Dan Schimelman . <p> More durable diaphragms illuminated another weak point in the design of diaphragm pumps : They are powered by brush dc motors . At best , the motor 's brushes last for 6,000 hours before wearing out . This became a real issue after Hargraves switched to longer-lasting diaphragms . <p> Hargraves solved the problem by switching to small brushless motors . This eliminated the brushes entirely . The company also developed a proprietary bearing cage design to reduce radial loading . As a result , motors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 've had some pumps that have lasted up to 70,000 hours , depending on application , " Schimelman said . <p> Hargraves ' diaphragm pumps come in several designs . The BTC series is a single-head miniature pump , and the BTC-IIS operates both pressure and vacuum with the same pump . The CTS Series is designed for very small spaces and lower flows , while the LTC Series is used in applications that require high efficiency . Alan S. Brown <p> Filtered Water Supply <p> The city of Waxahachie , Texas , has teamed with a neighboring utility district to prepare for water demands of the future . Waxahachie and its partner , Rockett Special Utility District , are taking bids for a new water treatment plant that , at least initially , will have four filtration trains using Memcor membrane filters from Siemens Water Technologies . The plant will be able to supply as many as 20.5 million gallons a day , which will be divided between Waxahachie and Rockett . <p> The city has more than 11,000 connections , and Rockett has just over 10,000 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kay Phillips , Rockett 's general manager , the special utility district currently purchases water from Waxahachie and the city of Midlothian , Texas , for distribution to customers mostly in Ellis County and in some parts of Dallas County . <p> The special utility district was formed in the 1960s to distribute water to rural customers . Its primary business is retail sale of water to users , and it also sells wholesale to some municipalities , she said . <p> According to Waxahachie 's director of utilities , David Bailey , the city has another plant in service , which was recently expanded to deliver up to 21 million gallons a day . That plant has potential for expansion to 27 mgd in the future , he said . <p> The city 's expansion plans are due in part to an intention to sell water to new customers in Ellis County , according to Bailey . <p> The new water treatment plant , named for recently retired city manager Robert W. Sokoll , is also being designed with allowances for expansion . According to the project 's lead engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worth , each filtration train in the plant has about 10 percent of its slots left open , where filters can be added in the future . <p> Bailey estimates that as many as five million gallons a day can be added to the plant 's capacity by the installation of membranes in all the remaining slots . <p> The Sokoll plant will occupy part of a 38-acre site . The full site could hold a plant capable of treating an estimated 80 million gallons a day , Bailey said . <p> According to Phillips , the plant site is part of an 80-acre parcel owned by Rockett . Roughly half will be deeded to the joint-venture plant . <p> The Siemens membrane systems will filter water piped by Tarrant Regional Water District from two reservoirs , Cedar Creek and Richland-Chambers . <p> According to Siemens , the Memcor submerged membrane filters to be used at the Sokoll plant provide a physical barrier to bacteria and parasites , including Cryptospiridium and Giardia . The systems are completely automated . <p> Gudal said that the filters were selected in an earlier round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lowest initial cost , but also came in lowest in a 10-year cost analysis . <p> According to Bailey , other features of the plant include on-site chlorine generation to eliminate the hazard of shipping chlorine . Water will be treated with ultraviolet light and hydrogen peroxide to control odor and taste . <p> A plant will treat 20 million gallons of water a day for a Texas city and utility district . <p> By Alan S.
