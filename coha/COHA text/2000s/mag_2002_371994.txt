CES SPECIAL <P> A LOT OF MOXI Probably the loudest buzz of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week surrounded the new venture from WebTV founder Steve Perlman . Moxi is a set-top box that 's got it all : digital video recording ( like TiVo , but even easier ) , a DVD player , 80 GB worth of storage for your music CDs , Internet access and , most important , wireless home networking ( so you can access its features from any TV or PC in the home ) . Moxi will launch at the end of 2002 as part of the Echostar satellite system , which is itself likely to merge with DirecTV . Can world domination be far behind ? <P> CYBERCHEF Dinner would be so much easier if you could call your oven from work and tell it to start cooking . With smart ovens from Tonight 's Menu , you will soon be able to . NASA technology keeps the roast cool until you dial in from a Web-ready cell phone to set the time and heat . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oven . <P> TRUE LIES Next time you tell a little white lie to your spouse or boss , be sure they 're not holding a Truster . This portable lie detector from DreamQuest analyzes sonic waves in the voice for signs of stress and claims 85% accuracy ; it even plugs into cell phones . Campaigning politicians everywhere , beware . <P>  --  By Chris Taylor
