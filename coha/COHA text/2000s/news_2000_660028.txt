STAR RATINGS MEANING **** Excellent *** Good ** Fair * Poor DUD The Worst <p> Adrenaline Drive ( Not rated ) Director : Shinobu Yaguchi . With Hikari Ishida , Masanobu Ando , Jovi Jova , Kazue Tsunogae , Yutaka Matushige. ( 111 min . ) Sterritt *** The heroes are a clerk and a health-care worker , both so bashful that it 's hard to imagine them having an adventure , until a minor car accident and a gas-pipe explosion put them on a collision course with gangsters scrambling to recover a bag full of stolen loot . The movie is stronger in its first hour than its second , but its amiable acting and feisty visual humor make it a must for fans of Japanese film .

( 90 min . ) Sterritt *** Hollywood pokes fun at itself as the animated squirrel and moose battle a trio of live-action villains who want to conquer America by flooding it with ultrarotten TV shows . The comedy is crammed with show-biz jokes that younger kids wo n't fathom , but the action is so quick and colorful that they probably wo n't mind . Older folks will find many chuckles , especially if they grew up watching the cartoon heroes ' own great ' 60s series . Staff *** Nostalgic , intermittently charming , good-natured .

Much of the acting is splendid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blend of liveliness and taste . In German with English subtitles <p> Alice and Martin ( R ) Director : Andre Techine . With Juliette Binoche , Alexis Loret , Carmen Maura , Pierre Maguelon , Marthe Villalonga , Jeremy Kreikenmayer , Eric Kreikenmayer , Jean-Pierre Lorit , Mathieu Amalric. ( 123 min . ) Sterritt *** The love affair of an attractive musician and a young man with a troubled family history . Techine 's tendency to exert tight control over every aspect of his movies can make them seem chilly , but this drama is richly photographed and enhanced by Binoche 's steadily appealing performance .

( 138 min . ) Sterritt **** Heaped with Oscars in 1950 , this classic show-business drama continues to hold up splendidly thanks to its savvy dialogue , indelible performances , and sardonic story about a clever young actress ( Baxter ) who worms her way into the life of a glamorous Broadway star ( Davis ) who 's beginning to show her age . They do n't make ' em like this anymore ! <p> All I Wan na Do ( PG-13 ) Director : Sarah Kernochan . With Kirsten Dunst , Heather Matarazzo , Gaby Hoffmann , Rachael Leigh Cook , Monica Keena , Lynn Redgrave . ( 94 min . ) Sterritt *** The spirited pupils at Miss Godard 's Preparatory School for Girls cope with the challenges of growing up , debate the advantages of female-only education , and decide to take action when their school heads toward a merger with an all-male academy . Lively acting lift this lightweight comedy up a notch . <p> Almost Famous ( R @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kate Hudson , Patrick Fugit , Frances McDormand , Jason Lee , Fairuza Balk , Anna Paquin , Noah Taylor , Philip Seymour Hoffman . ( 122 min . ) Sterritt *** The adventures of a very young rock-music journalist who accompanies a second-rate band on tour in the early ' 70s , chasing his story through a maze of distractions ranging from groupies and parties to the group 's insecurity about its future . Crowe 's screenplay is loosely based on his past experiences , and a sense of authenticity and sincerity shines through the movie 's Hollywood veneer . Fugit gives a starmaking performance as the teenage reporter , and Crudup and Lee are excellent as the band 's lead guitarist and singer , respectively . Best of all is Hoffman as Lester Bangs , the legendary rock critic who sees gloomy prospects for a pop scene that 's getting too grown- up for its own good .

With Christian Bale , Reese Witherspoon , Willem Dafoe , Chloe Sevigny , Jared Leto , Samantha Mathis , Matt Ross , Guinevere Turner . ( 100 min . ) Sterritt ** A crazed yuppie divides his time between power lunches on Wall Street and vicious murders in the streets and skyscrapers of a Manhattan suffering from its own hyperactive madness in the narcissistic ' 80s . Bret Easton Ellis 's novel is a manic blend of incisive satire and repellent violence . Harron and screenwriter Guinevere Turner reduce it to a standard- issue slasher movie , stylishly shot , but with little to distinguish it from a long line of " Psycho " - spawned gorefests . Staff **1/2 Grotesque , dark satire , eerily humorous . VS/N : 13 scenes , including 2 graphic sex scenes , some shower scenes , and porn videos playing in the background . VV : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dead bodies , and a murder with an ax . VP : 47 expressions , mostly harsh .

With Willem Dafoe , Edward Furlong , Mickey Rourke , John Heard , Seymour Cassel , Steve Buscemi , Tom Arnold , Danny Trejo. ( 94 min . ) Sterritt *** Sent to prison by a politically ambitious DA who wants to make an example of him , a first-time felon tries to serve his time quietly with the help of a thick-skinned inmate who befriends him , but one misstep after another gets him entangled with the jail 's worst elements . Buscemi 's directing blends hard-hitting visual qualities with great emotional energy and a refusal to let the story 's message - that potentially valuable lives can be lost rather than redeemed in the brutal penitentiary system - get lost in the gut-wrenching violence that runs through it . <p> The Art of War ( R ) Director : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maury Chaykin , Marie Matiko , Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa , Michael Biehn , Donald Sutherland . ( 117 min . ) Staff *1/2 An undercover United Nations agent assigned to help the US forward free trade with China is framed for a political murder . Not to get snippety with this Snipes movie that 's just meant as a harmless , summertime diversion , but it falls flat . And the paint-by-numbers script oddly enough does n't make all that much sense . A little heart , but no art . By Katherine Dillin Staff *1/2 Uninspired , gimmicky , flimsy .

VD : 4 scenes with alcohol , a few with tobacco , 1 with cocaine . <p> L'Atalante ( Not rated ) Director : Jean Vigo . With Michel Simon , Dita Parlo , Jean Daste , Louis Lefevre. ( 99 min . ) Sterritt **** Reissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who joins her boat-captain husband on a barge dominated by a crusty old seaman with a dim regard for society 's rules and conventions . Vigo became a legendary French director on the basis of a mere handful of films before his untimely death .

In French with English subtitles <p> The Autumn Heart ( Not rated ) Director : Steven Maler . With Tyne Daly , Ally Sheedy , Jack Davidson , Davidlee Willson , Marla Sucharetza , Marceline Hugot.

( 105 min . ) <p> Staff * Richard Gere plays Will , an aging skirt-chaser who falls for Charlotte , a sweet 20-something woman ( Ryder ) who has a terminal illness . Already , this flat storyline has problems . There 's no on-screen chemistry between Gere and Ryder , and the lines are so sappy you 'll want to burst out in laughter . Gere 's character also fathered a child - whom he abandoned - years ago . She 's grown up now and pregnant . Will Charlotte live and will Gere reunite with his daughter ? By the time this insipid melodrama ends , you 'll either be asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parney <p> Staff ** Harmless , romantic distraction , no sparks , done before . <p> VS/N : 1 suggestive scene and 2 of implied sex .

With Jamie Foxx , David Morse , Kimberly Elise , Doug Hutchison , David Paymer , Mike Epps , Jamie Kennedy , Robert Pastorelli , Nestor Serrano. ( 120 min . ) <p> Sterritt ** Feds use a petty thief to lure a killer into the open , manipulating the psychopath into thinking his small-time colleague knows the whereabouts of a hidden treasure trove . The comically tinged action is as lively as it is brainless , and it revels in violence a bit less eagerly than many thrillers of its ilk . <p> The Ballad of Ramblin ' Jack ( Not rated ) <p> Director : Aiyana Elliott . With Ramblin ' Jack Elliott , Pete Seeger , Dave Van Ronk , Arlo Guthrie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sterritt *** The life and times of folk singer Ramblin ' Jack Elliott , capturing his public persona - part cowboy , part hobo , part folkloric researcher , part barroom raconteur - and glimpses of the private individual who 's been playing this self-invented role since the 1950s . Some of the archival and interview footage is priceless , and the documentary gains extra interest from the fact that Elliott 's daughter directed it , using it as a way to gain some of the fatherly attention she did n't get while growing up . <p> Staff *** Winning , heartfelt , slow . <p> VS/N : Some innuendo . VV : None . VP : 19 expressions , a few harsh . VD : 3 scenes with alcohol , 6 with tobacco , 1 with marijuana . <p> Bamboozled ( R ) <p> Director : Spike Lee .

The movie mixes in-your-face comedy with over-the-top plot twists and outspoken social commentary . It 's a unique blend of history and hysteria , and there 's no escaping the dead-serious ideas that run beneath its flamboyant surface . <p> VS/N : None . VV : 4 scenes , including a shootout . VP : At least 283 expressions , many harsh . VD : 9 scenes including 3 with smoking , 3 with drinking and some of both in advertisements . <p> Barry Lyndon ( PG ) <p> Director : Stanley Kubrick . With Ryan O'Neal , Marisa Berenson , Patrick Magee , Hardy Kruger , Stephen Berkoff. ( 183 min . ) <p> Sterritt **** Revival of Kubrick 's ravishingly beautiful historical epic , first released in 1975 and celebrated primarily for John Alcott 's unprecedented feats of cinematography . Loving , gambling , spying , and dueling are among the activities of the eponymous 18th-century hero , drawn from the pages of William Makepeace Thackeray 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Director : Roger Christian . With John Travolta , Barry Pepper , Forest Whitaker , Kim Coates . ( 117 min . ) <p> Staff * It 's the year 3000 and a race called the Psychlos have invaded Earth and enslaved mankind for a mining operation . The film starts well with interesting comic book-style camera angles , but it never generates enough tension due to preposterous plot holes and liberal borrowings from other movies . Worse , alien villain Travolta delivers the script 's risible lines in an over-the-top " Rocky Horror Picture Show " performance that is completely at odds with the square-jawed approach of the hero ( Pepper ) . It 's like another awful " Planet of the Apes " sequel . By Stephen Humphries <p> VS/N : 1 instance of innuendo . VV : 14 scenes with violence , including shootings and beatings . VP : 12 mostly mild expressions . VD : 4 scenes with alcohol . <p> The Beach ( R ) <p> Director : Danny Boyle .

The scenery is splendid and DiCaprio looks extra-cool amid the palm trees and waterfalls . But the story is less original than its setting - it knocks off everything from " Lord of the Flies " to " The Blair Witch Project " - and its unromantic moods may make DiCaprio 's countless " Titanic " fans want to swim in the opposite direction . <p> Staff *1/2 Aimless , idyllic scenery but dull story line , poor character development . <p> VS/N : 2 scenes with sex and nudity , 1 is fairly graphic ; 1 suggestive scene . VV : 13 scenes with violence , including fights and a dead body . VP : 87 expressions , mostly harsh . VD : 4 scenes with alcohol , 10 with smoking , 5 with marijuana . <p> Beau Travail ( Not rated ) <p> Director : Claire Denis . With Denis Levant , Gregoire Colin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **** The setting is an outpost of the French Foreign Legion , the characters are tough-minded men having limited contact with the everyday world , and the themes cluster around the ultimately mysterious nature of human personality . Loosely based on Herman Melville 's great novella " Billy Budd : Foretopman , " this ravishingly filmed masterpiece is as emotionally stirring as it is dramatically enigmatic . It is must-see viewing for anyone interested in film 's ability to transform musical rhythms and painterly images into cinematic art of the highest order .

( 112 min . ) <p> Staff ** Driver is a woman so consumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heart , even having a devoted friend ( Adams ) raise her daughter ( Eisenberg ) . Field 's directorial debut assembles a marvelous cast , but is less a film than a sampler box of genres - nostalgia piece , buddy flick , satire , expose , coming-of-age story . Some of these morsels are tasty indeed . Others take a long time to chew . Fields has a heart . If she can emulate her heroine 's focus and drive , she may make a great movie some day . By M.K.

( 89 min . ) <p> Sterritt *** A visit with the dog-show set as they prepare their pooches for competition , steeling themselves for the wagging tail of victory or the droopy eyes of defeat .

With Mick Foley , Terry Funk , Jack Roberts . ( 102 min . ) <p> Sterritt **** Riveting , rambunctious documentary about the professional- wrestling scene , focusing on the personal experiences of the " athletes " who bash one another around in the ring . The movie reveals much about public and private aspects of this so-called sport . But stay far , far away unless you can handle the copious amounts of blood ( some of it phony ) and agonizing psychological problems ( all of them real ) that its participants face on what seems like a daily basis . <p> The Big Kahuna ( R ) <p> Director : John Swanbeck . With Kevin Spacey , Danny DeVito , Peter Facinelli. ( 90 min . ) <p> Sterritt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long evening in a hotel hospitality suite where they 've gathered to give a sales pitch .

( 110 min . ) <p> Sterritt *** The sprightly tale of a feisty lad who lives in England 's coal- mining country and wants to become a ballet dancer even though his family thinks that 's no ambition for a real man . The movie does a fine job of integrating its political interests - a fierce 1984 mining strike - with a deeply felt love of dancing . It also trumpets the worthwhile message that ballet is just as manly and athletic as any other masculine activity - and maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an uncomprehending community in order to pursue it . <p> Staff **** Year 's best , contagious energy , sweet story , a pure joy . <p> VS/N : Quick flash of male backside .

This is an old-style supernatural thriller in the vein of " The Omen " and " The Exorcist , " often trite and predictable but grudgingly likable in the end .

( 97 min . ) <p> Sterritt *** A slightly reedited version of the 1984 thriller that put the Coen Brothers on the map - directed by Joel , produced by Ethan , and written by both . It 's a grisly tale about a private eye hired by a jealous husband to kill his cheating wife , but if you can handle its horror-comic grotesquerie , you 'll find an enormous amount of cinematic imagination at work . Even the Coens have only managed to top this one a couple of times , most successfully in " Fargo " and the great " Barton Fink .

Glover and Bassett play the title characters with great energy , and Berry has invested the movie with the moral conscience that underpinned his entire career .

The original was overrated but this follow-up is downright awful , acted and directed with a pumped-up clunkiness that makes the first film 's deliberately amateurish air seem positively professional by comparison .

At once dreamily surreal and socially acute , the Belgian production features a splendid cast headed by Poelvoorde , previously celebrated for his searing 1992 performance in " Man Bites Dog . " In Flemish with English subtitles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zemeckis . With Tom Hanks , Helen Hunt , Nick Searcy , Chris Noth , Lari White .

Hanks 's extraordinary acting keeps the adventure involving even though the beginning is predictable , the middle is uneven , and the finale slips into Zemeckis 's patented brand of " Forrest Gump " fuzziness . <p> Catfish in Black Bean Sauce ( PG-13 ) <p> Director : Chi Muoi Lo .

( 88 min . ) <p> Sterritt *** A movie actress is kidnapped by a band of guerrilla filmmakers and forced to star in their latest no-budget epic , which they hope will expose Hollywood as a money-driven fraud and enshrine their anti-aesthetic in its place . The comedy is frantic and tasteless in the usual Waters mode , but it takes telling potshots at the Hollywood establishment , which is n't nearly so open about the tackiness of its products . <p> The Cell ( R ) <p> Director : Tarsem Singh .

( 115 min . ) <p> Sterritt ** Lopez plays a psychotherapist who makes a high-tech journey into the mind of a demented serial killer in a desperate effort to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim . The action is as grisly as it is surrealistic , which is what you 'd expect from a cinematic visit to a particularly loathsome subconscious . But the film 's patches of lurid sensationalism are partly offset by the director 's explosive visual imagination , which keeps the screen jumping when the plot and dialogue sag .

( 91 min . ) <p> Sterritt *** Documentary study of a French town whose residents saved and sheltered a large number of Jewish children during the Nazi era . History , human interest , and the overwhelming horror of the Holocaust are eloquently blended , thanks to the filmmakers ' sensitive approach to a subject that one of them ( Gossels ) has heard about all her life from a parent who was a Chabannes child . In English and French with English subtitles <p> Chocolat ( PG-13 ) <p> Director : Lasse Hallstrom .

Binoche and Molina are as magnetic as usual , but the unsubtle story is full of simplistic divisions between right and wrong , and the filmmaking is pretty but predictable .

( 95 min . ) <p> Sterritt *** A successful young man gets a surprise visit from a childhood friend - good fun at first , but less so when he realizes that his old pal has stayed as immature and dependent as he was when they were kids . The psychology of this likable comedy-drama is pretty shallow , especially when it gets into sexual matters .

The movie leaves out portions of John Irving 's novel that would have given it more balance and perspective , but the acting by Maguire and Caine is first-rate by any standard . <p> Staff *** Tender , lovingly photographed , captivating . <p> VS/N : 2 scenes with nudity , 1 brief sex scene .

Kerrigan 's style is too controlled and chilly to bring across the passion he clearly feels for his subject , which is ironic , since his earlier " Clean , Shaven " is a marvel of imaginative energy .

While disposing of the body , they fall into the clutches of a lascivious old hermit , who takes them both captive . Ozon generates a high charge of suspense at some points in the aggressively grisly story , but its eventual failure to make sense indicates that it 's intended more as a surrealistic fable than an ordinary sex-and-violence adventure .

But the movie 's real interest lies in a series of fighting scenes that veer between comic-book violence and cinematic ballet .

Bunuel devoted his brilliant career to surrealistic cinema , and this uproariously imaginative tale brought his subversive style to its pinnacle of popularity , helped by a picture-perfect cast and a screenplay written with Jean-Claude Carriere , one of his most trusty collaborators .

( 124 min ) <p> Sterritt *** Anderson shines with dark beauty and somber intelligence in this sensitive adaptation of Edith Wharton 's riveting novel about a socially ambitious young woman who falls prey to her own miscalculations and the unforgiving nature of foes and friends alike .

Carrey is excellent , making the most of his comic gifts even in a cumbersome Grinch outfit , and the eye-spinning color scheme is dazzling to behold .

It also looks in on his interviews with a series of women who talk candidly about how racism , sexism , and poverty affect their everyday experiences . The movie will appeal most to people with a special interest in Cuban society , but anyone can appreciate its warmly sympathetic vision of ordinary people living ordinary lives .

The plot is n't very original , but the acting and dialogue have a low-key realism that packs more emotional punch than a dozen of the standard-issue romantic dramas crowding the independent-film scene . <p> Is n't She Great ( R ) <p> Director : Andrew Bergman . With Bette Midler , Nathan Lane , Stockard Channing , John Cleese , David Hyde Pierce , Amanda Peet , John Larroquette , Paul Benedict . ( 90 min . ) <p> Sterritt *** Midler preens , prances , pouts , and generally kicks up a storm as notorious novelist Jacqueline Susann . Paul Rudnick 's screenplay keeps feeding her the rude laughs and boisterous situations she needs to sustain the story 's precarious balance between comedy and pathos .

He stumbles into more than his share of disasters but finds a measure of redemption when he discovers that caring for others is a pathway to a meaningful life . The latter element joins with Crudup 's excellent acting to make this deliberately scruffy tale a worthwhile experience if you can handle its explicitly sordid subplots . <p> VS/N : 1 sex scene with nudity , 3 of implied sex , 2 of nudity , 1 suggestive scene .

Turteltaub makes the most of a solid screenplay and talented cast , rarely forcing the humor but letting it emerge from situations in its own good time .

Few would argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own best instincts . The trouble lies in its stereotypical style , its schmaltzy emotionalism , and its romanticized view of a white man 's world in which it 's taken for granted that even the most enlightened African-American must be a servant as well as a sage .

" As usual in the " Scream " movies , the only way to scramble for safety is to remember the rules of the horror-film genre - which is n't as easy as it sounds , since the rules may vary depending on whether the murderer thinks this is a trilogy or an ongoing series ! Craven has n't forgotten how to pile on the shocks and thrills , but the screenplay is more clever than convincing , and it 's not clear that " Scream 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be if it ever reached your local multiplex . <p> Staff *** Great fun , scary , what a scream ! , playful sequel . <p> VS/N : 1 scene of nudity through a steamy shower glass .

( 98 min . ) <p> Sterritt * The original " Shaft , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for " blaxploitation " movies . This follow-up retains little but the name , race , and no-nonsense attitude of the African-American hero , pitted here against crooked cops and a psychotic drug dealer as he tracks down the lone witness to a racially charged murder . Singleton does his best directing since his powerful " Boyz N the Hood , " and Wright 's brilliant acting almost makes his vicious character worth watching . But the plot is a shameless plea for vigilante violence , and the dignity of the black hero is outweighed by the ethnically marked evil of his Hispanic antagonist .
