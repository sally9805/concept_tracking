Two // I was arrested on January 15 , 1982 , at about nine o'clock at night . I was sixteen . // Earlier that day , I woke before dawn and could n't go back to sleep . My bedroom felt darker and colder than usual , so I stayed under my camel-wool duvet and waited for the sun , but it seemed like darkness was there to stay . On cold days like this , I wished our apartment had better heating ; two kerosene heaters were n't enough , but my parents always told me I was the only one who found the house too chilly in winter . // My parents ' bedroom was next to mine , and the kitchen was across the narrow hallway that connected the two ends of our three-bedroom apartment . I listened as my father got ready for work . Although he moved lightly and quietly , the faint sounds he made helped me trace his movements to the bathroom and then to the kitchen . The kettle whistled . The fridge opened and closed . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a dim light crawled in through my window . My father had already left for work , and my mother was still sleeping . She did n't usually get out of bed until nine o'clock . I tossed , turned , and waited . Where was the sun ? I tried to make plans for the day , but it was useless . I felt like I had tripped out of the normal flow of time . I stepped out of bed . The linoleum floor was even colder than the air and the kitchen was darker than my bedroom . It was as if I would never feel warm again . Maybe the sun was never going to rise . After having a cup of tea , all I could think of doing was to go to church . I put on the long brown wool coat my mother had made for me , covered my hair with a large beige shawl , and climbed down the twenty-four gray stone steps leading to the front door , which connected our apartment to the busy downtown street . The stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked to the church without looking up . There was nothing to see . Pictures of Ayatollah Khomeini and hateful slogans like " Death to America , " " Death to Israel , " " Death to Communists and All the Enemies of Islam , " and " Death to Anti-Revolutionaries " covered most walls . // It took me five minutes to get to the church . When I put my hand on the heavy wooden main door , a snowflake landed on my nose . Tehran always looked innocently beautiful under the deceiving curves of snow , and although the Islamic regime had banned most beautiful things , it could n't stop the snow from falling . The government had ordered women to cover their hair and had issued edicts against music , makeup , paintings of unveiled women , and Western books , which had all been declared satanic and therefore illegal . I stepped inside the church , closed the door behind me , and sat in a corner , staring at the image of Jesus on the cross . The church was empty . I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After about half an hour , I went to the church office to say hello to the priests and found myself standing face to face with Andre , the handsome organist . We had met a few months back , and I frequently saw him at the church . Everyone knew we liked each other , but we were both too shy to admit it , maybe because Andre was seven years older than I. Blushing , I asked him why he was there so early in the morning , and he explained that he had come to fix a broken vacuum cleaner . // " I have n't seen you in days , " he said . " Where have you been ? I called your house a few times , and your mother said you were n't feeling well . I was thinking about coming to your house today . " // " I was n't well . Just a cold or something . " // He decided I looked too pale and should have stayed in bed for another couple of days , and I agreed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air and walked home . If I was n't so worried and depressed , I would have loved to spend time with him , but ever since my school friends , Sarah and Gita and Sarah 's brother , Sirus , had been arrested and taken to Evin Prison , I had not been able to function . Sarah and I had been best friends since the first grade , and Gita had been a good friend of mine for more than three years . Gita had been arrested in mid-November and Sarah and Sirus on January 2 . I could see Gita with her silky long brown hair and Mona Lisa smile , sitting on a bench by the basketball court . I wondered what had happened to Ramin , the boy she liked . She never heard from him after the summer of 1978 , the last summer before the revolution , before the new order of the world . Now , she had been in Evin for more than two months , and her parents had not been allowed to see her . I called them once a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gita 's mother stood at the door of their house for hours every day and stared at passersby , expecting Gita to come home . Sarah 's parents had gone to the prison many times and had asked to see their children but had been denied . // Evin had been a political prison since the time of the shah . The name brought fear to every heart : it equaled torture and death . Its many buildings were scattered across a large area north of Tehran at the foot of the Alborz Mountains . People never talked about Evin ; it was shrouded with fearful silence . // The night Sarah and Sirus were arrested , I had been lying on my bed , reading a collection of poems by Forough Farrokhzad when my bedroom door burst open and my mother appeared in the doorway . // " Sarah 's mother just called . . . " she said . // I felt as if I were breathing shards of ice . // " Revolutionary guards arrested both Sarah and Sirus about an hour ago and took them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " What have they done ? " my mother asked . // Poor Sarah and Sirus . They must have been terrified . But they were going to be fine . They had to be fine . // " Marina , answer me . What have they done ? " // My mother closed my bedroom door behind her and leaned against it . // " Nothing . Well , Sarah has done nothing , but Sirus is a member of the Mojahedin . " My voice sounded weak and distant to me . The Mojahedin-e Khalgh Organization was a leftist Muslim group that had fought against the shah since the 1960s . After the success of the Islamic revolution , its members opposed Ayatollah Khomeini 's unlimited power as the supreme leader of Iran and called him a dictator . As a result , the Islamic government declared their party illegal . // " I see . Then maybe they took Sarah because of Sirus. " // " Maybe . " // " Their poor mother . She was beside herself . " // " Did the guards say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worry , that they just wanted to ask them a few questions . " // " So , they might let them go soon . " // " Well , from what you 're telling me I 'm sure they 'll let Sarah go soon . But Sirus . . . well , he should have known better . There 's no need to worry . " // My mother left my room , and I tried to think but could n't . Feeling exhausted , I closed my eyes and fell into a dreamless sleep . // For twelve days after this , I slept most of the time . Even the thought of doing the simplest tasks felt tiring and impossible . I was n't hungry or thirsty . I did n't want to read , go anywhere , or talk to anyone . Every night , my mother told me there was no news of Sarah and Sirus . Since they had been arrested , I knew I would be next . My name was on a list of names and addresses my chemistry teacher , Khanoom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our principal , Khanoom Mahmoodi , was a revolutionary guard . Khanoom Bahman was a good woman , and she had warned me that this list was addressed to the Courts of Islamic Revolution . However , there was nothing I could do but wait . I could n't hide . Where would I go ? The revolutionary guards were merciless . If they went to a house to arrest someone and that person was not home , they would take whoever was there . I could n't risk my parents ' lives to save myself . During the past few months hundreds of people had been arrested , accused of opposing the government in one way or another . // At nine o'clock at night , I went to take a bath . As soon as I turned the tap on and the water began to steam , the sound of the doorbell echoed in the house . My heart sank . No one rang our doorbell at this hour . // Turning the tap off , I sat on the edge of the tub . I heard my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my mother called my name . I unlocked the bathroom door and opened it . Two armed , bearded revolutionary guards wearing dark green military-style uniforms were standing in the hallway . One of them pointed his gun at me . I felt as though I had stepped out of my body and was watching a movie . This was n't happening to me but to someone else , someone I did n't know . // " You stay here with them while I search the apartment , " the second guard said to his friend and then turned to me and asked , " Where 's your room ? " His breath smelled of onions and made my stomach turn . // " Down the hallway , first door on your right . " // My mother 's body was shaking and her face had turned white . She had covered her mouth with her hand , as if to muffle a never-ending cry . My father was staring at me ; he looked as if I were dying from a sudden , incurable disease and there was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face . I had not seen him cry since my grandmother 's death . // The other guard soon came back with a handful of my books , all Western novels . // " Are these yours ? " // " Yes . " // " We 'll take a few of them as evidence . " // " Evidence of what ? " // " Of your activities against the Islamic government . " // " I do n't agree with the government , but I have n't done anything against it . " // " I 'm not here to decide whether you 're guilty or not ; I 'm here to arrest you . Put a chador on . " // " I 'm a Christian . I do n't have a chador. " // They were surprised . " That 's fine , " said one of them . " Put on a scarf and let 's go . " // " Where are you taking her ? " my mother asked . // " To Evin , " they answered . // With one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grabbed my beige cashmere shawl , and covered my hair with it . It was a very cold night , and the shawl was going to keep me warm , I decided . As we were about to step out of the room , my eyes fixed on my rosary , which sat on my desk . I took it . // " Hey , wait ! What 's that ? " said the guard . // " My prayer beads . Can I bring them with me ? " // " Let me see . " // I handed him the rosary . He studied it , looking closely at each one of its pale blue stones and its silver cross . // " You can bring them . Praying is exactly what you need to do in Evin. " // I dropped the rosary in my pocket . // The guards guided me to a black Mercedes parked at our door . They opened the back door , and I stepped in . The car started to move . I looked back and caught a glimpse of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows of my parents standing in the doorway . I knew I was supposed to be terrified , but I was n't . A cold void had surrounded me. // " I have a piece of advice for you , " said one of the guards . " It 's in your best interest to answer every question you 're asked truthfully or you 'll pay for it . You 've probably heard that at Evin , they have their ways of making people talk . You can avoid the pain if you tell the truth . " // The car speeded north toward the Alborz Mountains . At that hour , the streets were almost empty ; there were no pedestrians and only a few cars . Traffic lights were visible from a distance , changing from red to green and back again . After about half an hour , in the pale moonlight , I saw the snakelike walls of Evin zigzagging across the hills . One of the guards was telling the other about his sister 's upcoming marriage . He was very glad that the groom was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought of Andre . A dull pain filled my stomach and spread into my bones , but it was as if something terrible had happened to him and not to me. // We entered a narrow , winding street , and the tall red brick walls of the prison appeared on our right . Every few yards , from lookout towers , floodlights poured their intense brightness into the night . We neared a large metal gate and came to a stop in front of it . There were bearded , armed guards everywhere . The barbed wire covering the top of the wall cast a tangled shadow on the pavement . The driver stepped out , and the guard sitting in the front passenger seat gave me a thick strip of cloth and told me to blindfold myself . " Make sure it 's on properly , or you 'll get in trouble ! " he barked . With my blindfold in place , the car passed through the gates and continued for two or three minutes before again coming to a stop . The doors were opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wrists with rope and dragged me along . I stumbled over an obstacle and fell . // " Are you blind ? " a voice asked , and laughter followed . // Soon , it felt warmer , and I knew we had entered a building . A narrow strip of light appeared below my blindfold , and I saw that we were walking along a corridor . The air smelled of sweat and vomit . I was instructed to sit on the floor and wait . I could feel other people sitting close to me , but I could n't see them . Everyone was silent , but vague , angry voices came from behind closed doors . Every once in a while , I filtered out a word or two : Liar ! Tell me ! Names ! Write it ! And , sometimes , I heard people scream in pain . My heart began to beat so fast , it pushed against my chest and made it ache , so I put my hands on it and pressed down . After awhile , a harsh voice told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , and she was crying . // " Why are you crying ? " I whispered . // " I 'm scared ! " she said . " I want to go home . " // " I know , me too , but do n't cry . It 's not going to help . I 'm sure they 'll let us go home soon , " I lied . // " No , they wo n't , " she cried . " I 'm going to die here ! We 're all going to die here ! " // " You have to be brave , " I said and regretted saying it right away . Maybe she had been tortured . How dare I tell her to be brave ? // " This is very interesting , " said a man 's voice . " Marina , you 're coming with me . Get up and walk ten steps ahead . Then turn right . " // The girl was crying loudly now . I did as I was told . The voice instructed me to take four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was told to sit on a chair . // " You were very brave out there . Bravery is a rare quality in Evin . I 've seen many strong men fall apart here . So , you 're Armenian ? " // " No. " // " But you told the guards you were Christian . " // " I am a Christian . " // " So , you 're Assyrian ? " // " No. " // " You 're not making any sense . Christians are either Armenian or Assyrian. " // " Most Iranian Christians are , but not all . Both my grandmothers migrated to Iran from Russia after the Russian revolution . " // My grandmothers had married Iranian men who worked in Russia before the 1917 Communist revolution , but after the revolution , their husbands were forced to leave the Soviet Union because they were n't Russian citizens , and my grandmothers chose to come to Iran with them . // " So they 're communists . " // " If they were communists , why would they leave their country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both devout Christians . " // The man told me that a part of the Holy Koran spoke about Mary , Jesus ' mother . He said that Muslims believed that Jesus was a great prophet and that they had great respect for Mary . He offered to read that part of the Koran for me . I listened as he read the Arabic text . He had a deep and gentle voice . // " So , what do you think ? " he asked when he finished reading . I wanted him to continue , knowing that I was safe as long as he kept on reading , but I also knew I could n't trust him . He was probably a revolutionary guard and a violent man who tortured and killed innocents without remorse . // " It was very nice . I 've studied the Koran , and I 've read that passage before , " I said . My words came out of my mouth slightly jagged . // " You 've studied the Holy Koran ? Now , this is even more interesting ! A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're still a Christian , even though you know about our prophet and his teachings ? " // " Yes , I am. " // My mother had always told me that I spoke without thinking . She mentioned this when I answered questions truthfully , when I did my best not to be misunderstood . // " Interesting ! " the Koran reader said with a laugh . " I 'd like to continue this conversation at a more appropriate time , but right now , Brother Hamehd is waiting to ask you a few questions . " // It seemed like I had truly amused him . Maybe I was the only Christian he had ever seen in Evin . He probably had expected me to be like most Muslim girls from traditional families : quiet , shy , and submissive , and I did n't have any of these qualities . // I heard him rise from his chair and leave the room . I felt numb . Maybe this was a place beyond fear where all normal human emotions suffocated without the luxury of even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to torture me . Torture was usually used to extract information . I did n't know anything that could be of any use to them ; I did n't belong to any political groups . // The door opened and closed , and I jumped . The Koran reader had returned . He introduced himself as Ali and told me that Hamehd was busy interrogating someone else . Ali explained that he worked for the sixth division of the Courts of Islamic Revolution , which was investigating my case . He sounded calm and patient but warned me that I had to tell the truth . It was very strange to have a conversation with someone without being able to see him . I had no idea what he looked like , how old he was , or what kind of a room we were in. // He told me that he knew I had expressed antirevolutionary ideas in school and that I had written articles against the government in my school newspaper . I did n't deny it . This was not a secret or a crime . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I said I did n't . He knew about the strike I had started at school and believed that it was impossible for an individual without any connections with illegal political parties to organize a strike . I explained that I had not organized anything , which was the truth . I had only asked the calculus teacher to teach calculus instead of politics . She had told me to get out of the classroom , I had , and my classmates had followed me , and before I knew it , most of the students had heard about what had happened and had refused to go back to class . He could n't believe that it had been this simple , saying that the information he had received suggested I had strong connections to communist groups . // " I do n't know where you get your information , " I said , " but it 's completely wrong . I 've studied communism the same way I 've studied Islam , and it has n't made me a communist any more than it has made me a Muslim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , laughing . " Give me the names of all the communists or any other antirevolutionaries from your school , and I 'll believe you are n't lying . " // Why was he asking me for the names of my schoolmates ? He knew about the strike and the school newspaper , so Khanoom Mahmoodi must have talked to him and given him her list . But I could n't risk telling him anything , because I did n't know whose name , besides mine , was on the list . // " I wo n't give you any names , " I said . // " I knew you were on their side . " // " I 'm not on anybody 's side . If I give you names , you 'll arrest them . I do n't want that to happen . " // " Yes , we 'll arrest them to make sure they are n't doing anything against the government , and if they are n't , we 'll let them go . But if they are , we 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . " // " I wo n't give you any names . " // " How about Shahrzad ? Are you denying that you know her ? " // For a moment , I did n't know who he was talking about . Who was Shahrzad ? But I soon remembered . She was a friend of Gita 's and was a member of a communist group named Fadayian-e Khalgh . About two weeks before the summer holidays , Gita had asked me to meet with her , hoping that Shahrzad would be able to talk me into joining their group . I met with her only once and explained to her that I was a practicing Christian and was not interested in joining any communist groups . // Ali told me that they had been watching Shahrzad , but she had realized she was being watched and had gone into hiding . They had been searching for her for some time and believed she might have met with me again . Ali said that Shahrzad must have had a better reason for meeting with me than talking me into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her time like that . No matter how much I tried to explain to him that I had nothing to do with her , he would n't believe me. // " We have to know her whereabouts , " he said . // " I ca n't help you , because I do n't know where she is. " // He had remained calm during the interrogation and had never raised his voice . " Marina , listen carefully . I can see that you 're a brave girl , and I respect this , but I have to know what you know . If you are n't willing to tell me , Brother Hamehd will be very upset . He is n't a very patient man . I do n't want to see you suffer . " // " I 'm sorry , but I do n't have anything to tell you . " // " I 'm sorry , too , " he said and led me out of the room and through three or four hallways . A man was screaming . I was told to sit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who was screaming did n't want to share any information but that he would soon change his mind . // Pain-saturated cries filled the air around me . Heavy , deep , and desperate , they penetrated my skin , spreading into every cell of my body . The poor man was being torn apart . The world became a slab of lead sitting on my chest . // The loud , severe impact of the lash . The man 's scream . A split second of silence . And the cycle repeated itself . // After a few minutes , someone asked the man if he was ready to talk . His answer was no . The lashing started again . Although my wrists were tied , I tried to cover my ears with my arms to push the screams away , but it was useless . It went on and on , strike after strike , scream after scream . // " Stop . . . please . . . I 'll talk . . . " the suffering man finally cried . // It stopped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to give them any names . I was not helpless . I was going to put up a fight . // " Marina , how are you ? " asked the voice that had questioned the suffering man . " Ali has told me all about you . You have impressed him . He does n't want you to get hurt , but business is business . Did you hear that man ? He did n't want to tell me anything at the beginning , but he did at the end . It would 've been a lot smarter if he 'd told me what I wanted to know at the start . Now , are you ready to talk ? " // I took a deep breath . " No. " // " Too bad . Get up . " // He grabbed the rope that was tied around my wrists , dragged me along for a few steps , and then pushed me to the ground . My blindfold was pulled off . A thin , small man with short brown hair and a mustache stood over me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his early forties and was wearing brown casual pants and a white shirt . The room was empty except for a bare wooden bed with a metal headboard . He untied my wrists . // " Rope wo n't do ; we need something harder and stronger , " he said . He took a pair of handcuffs out of one of his pockets and put them on my wrists . // Another man entered the room . He was about six feet one and two hundred pounds , had very short black hair and a trimmed black beard , and was in his late twenties . // " Hamehd , has she talked ? " he asked . // " No , she 's pretty stubborn , but do n't worry ; she 'll talk soon . " // " Marina , this is your last chance , " the newcomer said . I recognized his voice . Ali . His nose was a little too large , his brown eyes were expressive , and his eyelashes were long and thick . " You 're going to talk at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Will you give us the names ? " // " No. " // " What I really want you to tell me is where Shahrzad is. " // " I do n't know where she is. " // " Ali , look ; she has such small wrists ! They 'll slide out of the cuffs , " said Hamehd . He forced both my wrists into one cuff and dragged me to the bed . The metal cuff dug into my bones . A scream escaped my throat , but I did n't struggle , knowing that my situation was hopeless and would only worsen if I put up a fight . He fastened the free cuff to the metal headboard . Then , after pulling off my shoes , he tied my ankles to the bed . // " I 'm going to whip the soles of your feet with this cable , " Hamehd said , waving a length of black cable , which was a little less than an inch thick , in front of my face . // " Ali , how many do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // " Not many . " // " I 'm saying ten . " // The sharp , threatening whistle of the cable cut the air , and it landed on the soles of my feet . // Pain . I had never experienced anything like it . I could n't even have imagined it . It exploded inside me like a bolt of lightning . // Second strike : my breath stopped in my throat . How could anything hurt so much ? I tried to think of a way to help myself bear it . I could n't scream , because there was n't enough air left in my lungs . // Third strike : the scream of the cable and the blinding agony that followed . The " Hail Mary " filled my head . // Blows came , one after the other , and I prayed , struggling against pain . I hoped to lose consciousness , but it did n't happen . Each strike kept me wide awake for the next . // Tenth strike : I begged God to ease the pain . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it . // God , please , do n't leave me on my own . I ca n't take it . // It went on and on . Endless agony . // They 'll stop if I give them a few names . . . No , they wo n't stop . They want to know about Shahrzad . I do n't know anything about her anyway . The beating ca n't go on forever . I 'll take it one at a time . // After sixteen strikes of the lash , I gave up counting . // Pain . // " Where is Shahrzad ? " // I would have told if I knew . I would have done anything to stop it . // Strike . // I had experienced different kinds of pain before . I had broken my arm once . But this was worse . Far worse . // " Where is Shahrzad ? " // " I really do n't know ! " // Agony . // Voices . // When Hamehd stopped , I could just find enough energy to turn my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handcuffs and untied my ankles . My feet ached , but the agonizing pain was gone , replaced by a soothing emptiness that spread inside my veins . A moment later , I could hardly feel my body , and my eyelids began to feel heavy . Something cold splashed against my face . Water . I shook my head . // " You 're passing out , Marina . Come on , sit up , " said Ali . // He pulled on my arms , and I sat up . My feet were now stinging as if a hundred bees had stung them . I looked at them . They were red and blue and very swollen . I was surprised that my skin had not burst . // " Do you have anything to tell me now ? " Ali asked . // " No. " // " This is n't worth it ! " He glared at me . " Do you want another beating ? Your feet will look a lot worse if you do n't talk . " // " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It 's stupidity ! You could easily be executed for not cooperating with the government . Do n't do this to yourself . " // " Do n't do this to me , " I corrected him . // He looked me straight in the eyes for the first time and told me that they had all the names from my school . Khanoom Mahmoodi had given them the list . He said that my cooperation would change nothing for any of my friends , but it would save me from torture . He said that my friends would be arrested whether I talked or not , but if I wrote down their names , I would n't have to suffer any longer . // " I believe that you 're telling the truth about Shahrzad , " he said . " Do n't try to be a hero ; you could lose your life for it . Hamehd is sure that you 're a member of the Fadayian , but I do n't think so . A Fadayee would n't pray to Mary under torture . " // I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked if I were allowed to go to the bathroom , and he took my arm and helped me up . I felt dizzy . He put a pair of rubber slippers on the floor in front of the bed . They were at least four sizes too big for me , but because of the swelling they were too small . It hurt to put them on . He helped me walk across the room . It was not easy to keep my balance . Once we got to the door , he let go of my arm , gave me my blindfold , and told me to put it on . I did . He put a length of rope in my hand and guided me to the bathroom door . I stepped in , turned on the tap , and washed my face with cold water . A sudden wave of nausea rushed through me , my stomach contracted , and I vomited . It felt like a knife had cut me in half . A loud ringing filled my ears , and darkness swallowed me. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I was . As my mind gradually cleared , I realized I was n't in the bathroom anymore but was lying on the wooden bed where I had been tortured . Ali sat on a chair , watching me . My head felt very sore , and when I touched it , I felt a big bump on the right side of my forehead . I asked Ali what had happened , and he said I had fallen in the bathroom and had hit my head . He said that the doctor had seen me and had said that my condition was n't too serious . Then he helped me sit in a wheelchair , put my blindfold back on , and pushed me out of the room . When he took off the blindfold , we were in a very small room with no windows and a toilet and a sink in the corner . There were two gray military blankets on the floor . He helped me lie down and spread one of them over me ; it was rough and stiff and smelled of mold , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if I was in pain , and I nodded , wondering why he was being nice to me . He left but came back in a few minutes with a middle-aged man wearing a military uniform whom he introduced as Doctor Sheikh . // The doctor gave me some kind of injection in the arm , and he and Ali left the cell . I closed my eyes and thought of home . I wished I could crawl into my grandmother 's bed as I used to when I was a child , so she could tell me there was no reason to be scared , that it had all been a nightmare . //
