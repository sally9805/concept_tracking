Sliding down an icy hill at 80 miles per hour , Flowers , 28 , was on her way to the history books as the brakewoman of USA-2 . " This is a dream come true for me , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winter Olympics . I 'm the only African-American woman on my team now . Hopefully this will encourage other African-American boys and girls to give winter sports a try because you do n't see too many of them out there . " Photograph A United States four-man bobsled team ( l-r ) , Bill Schnuffenhauer , Garrett Hines , Todd Hays and Randy Jones , wear their silver medals at the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics celebration . Hines and Jones became the first Black men to medal at a Winter Olympics . // Flowers ' road to the Olympics took many turns in the last two years . The track star out of the University of Alabama-Birmingham had a goal of making the U.S. Summer Olympic team as a long jumper . But three surgeries-two knee and one ankle operation-dashed those hopes . She finished 15th at the 1996 trials and 13th at the 2000 trials . When Flowers returned to her hotel room in Sacramento after she failed to qualify , her husband , Johnny Flowers , showed her a flyer advertising tryouts for the U.S. bobsled team . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV , within days she was on a plane to Germany . Nevertheless , as a native of Helena , AL , Flowers and others thought her participation in the winter sport was a joke . " People in Alabama laughed when we told them , " Flowers ' husband said . " The old stereotypes came up . Black people do n't like the cold , all that stuff . " Flowers added , " I have nothing against the cold ; I just do n't like being out in it for a while . " Since she started racing in the fall of 2000 , Flowers has been two drivers ' brakewoman , that 's the person who helps push the sled and then , on the way down the hill , helps balance it to keep it from hitting the walls . Flowers ' gold medal goes to show her seriousness about the sport and her status as the best brakewoman in the world . " I have truly been blessed to come into this sport and pick it up so fast , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a different plan for me . " The men 's four-man bobsled team finally ended a 46-year drought of producing an Olympic medal . Hines , the brakeman , and Jones , the pusher of USA-1 , won silver medals that placed them in history as the only Black men to medal at a Winter Games . " After nine years of bobsledding , six World Championships and two Olympics , I committed myself to train through the 2002 Salt Lake Games , " said Hines who will be 33 on March 7 . " These Games will be forever etched in U.S. history and I could not miss a chance at representing my country . " Hines works in the paint department of his local Home Depot when he is not training . His playing on the football team and running for the track team at Southern Illinois University sparked his bobsledding athleticism . A Chicago native , he graduated in 1992 with a degree in biological science before pursuing his bobsleigh career . The 32-year-old Jones is also a multisport athlete . He was a sprinter for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team at Duke University . He graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering in 1992 , when he shortly started competing in bobsledding events . Jones , of Winston-Salem , NC , is a three-time Olympian . At the 1993 World Championships in Austria , his four-man team won a bronze medal . He also won a bronze medal in the four-man bobsled at the 1997 World Championships in Switzerland . <p>
