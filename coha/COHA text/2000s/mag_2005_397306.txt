Section : DEATH THREATS Part Two of a Three-Part Series PROSTATE CANCER Chances are , deep inside you , prostate cancer is forming . Defuse it now  --  or you 'll have to deal with it later <p> " He 's in the hospital . " <p> " The cancer has spread . " <p> " We 're hoping for the best . " <p> It 's amazing , the life-changing capacity of a single phone call . Just a minute before , my wife and I were happily packing for a vacation , our tangle of clothes in the middle of the room , the price tag still attached to her new Lycra swimsuit . Then came the call from Ellen 's mom . Her dad 's prostate cancer was back , and it had spread to his spine . We hastily changed our travel plans . Destination : Los Angeles . <p> A dashing , fit , silver-haired professor of psychology at UCLA , Michael Goldstein had had a brush with prostate cancer 3 years earlier . Although he had n't suffered the symptoms that sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensation when he did  --  a blood test at his annual physical indicated high levels of prostate-specific antigen , or PSA . His family had been surprised , given the trademark high energy that allowed him to teach graduate seminars , conduct his own research , and fly to and from Europe several times a year to lecture in Rome , London , and Amsterdam . After he opted to have the cancerous gland removed , his doctors pronounced him cured , and he threw himself back , with gusto , into his work , his family , his life . <p> We arrived in Los Angeles the morning after the phone call and drove straight to the hospital . When we walked into my father-in-law 's room , he seemed tired , a trifle sallow , but otherwise still his optimistic , glass-half-full self . A nurse was teaching him to walk with a back brace that looked about as comfortable as a corset . Outside , a dry wind rattled the eucalyptus fronds , but here the air smelled of disinfectants , and the light was eternal fluorescent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 months earlier , on a snowy , breezy afternoon in Manhattan . Ellen walked down the aisle on her father 's arm as he radiated paternal pride . At the reception , he charmed the guests with a toast only a father could give : " As a girl , Ellen loved to hear stories  --  and I always knew she 'd marry a man who would regale her with story after story .. " <p> Now , as we tried to summon comforting , clich-free words , he teetered down the corridor , tracing his right hand along the rail for support . I helped him practice his new steps , his arm slung across my shoulder . A week later , tests confirmed that the cancer had , in fact , spread . Somehow he maintained his confident , cheerful faade , yet the creases around his eyes hinted that he knew . He was , after all , a man of science . The little lifts of good news  --  We 've confined the cancer to just a few spots on the spinal column , some mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the damned brace  --  were only temporary lulls in a gathering storm . In less than 7 months , he was gone . ABOUT 635 MEN A DAY ARE DIAGNOSED WITH PROSTATE CANCER . <p> It 's a frightening figure . But perhaps not scary enough , since many young men still dismiss the disease as just another unavoidable side effect of aging . <p> Here 's why you should take it more seriously : Groundbreaking autopsy studies from Wayne State University show that prostate-cancer risk rises 10 percentage points with each passing decade . Thirty-year-olds have a 30 percent chance of carrying a trace of the cancer , fortysomethings a 40 percent chance , and so on . Sure , it usually progresses so slowly that most men die of something else first , but prostate cancer does kill more than 30,000 men annually  --  1 percent are under the age of 55 , and 8 percent are under age 65 . More virulent forms , like my father-in-law 's , can kill in less than a year . <p> The prostate gland , scarcely larger than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urethra , ideally situated to perform its primary function : to secrete seminal fluid for ejaculation , so that sperm can be propelled through the urethra and out to begin their mad dash to meet a lonely ovum . It 's ironic , then , that a gland that plays such a central role in creating life  --  greasing the skids , as it were  --  threatens to end a man 's life as well . <p> The most important men in my life have been dancing around this killer for a few years now . Not only did the disease take my father-in-law at the age of 67 , but my own 76-year-old father is at increased risk . His most recent blood test revealed a moderately elevated PSA . My grandfather also developed prostate cancer as he struggled with his final , fatal pneumonia . ( He was 92 at the time , so a urologist might say he " lived long enough " to contract the illness . ) And , of course , I have the number-one risk factor : I 'm a man . <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease having cut short the lives of two men in his family . Recently , he confided his anxiety : " Dude , I 'm toast . " <p> So , on a warm June morning , I visit Daniel Petrylak , M.D. , an oncologist at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital 's Irving Cancer Center , in New York City . Dr. Petrylak , a leading prostate-cancer researcher , has helped shape the course of treatment . With me is a list of questions you 'd expect a journalist writing a story about prostate cancer to be carrying . But I also carry a second list , one that probably reads a lot like yours : Exactly how at risk am I ? Should I have a PSA test ? What can I do to reduce my risk ? <p> And then I have a final , more personal question : Could my father-in-law have been saved ? <p> " So you 're concerned that you 're at risk ? " asks Dr. Petrylak , a handsome , dapper man with deep brown eyes . His gaze flits back and forth from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been on my mind , " I respond . <p> " How old are you ? " <p> " Just turned 40 . " <p> " All men over 50 should have a PSA test , " says Dr. Petrylak . " But the earlier a man and his doctor can catch prostate cancer , the broader the range of treatment options . " <p> PSA , a protein manufactured in the prostate , is measured with a simple blood test . Men with prostate cancer , or even enlargement of the prostate , have higher levels of PSA , because it rises in response to any type of trauma . Dr. Petrylak explains that a PSA count above 4.0 ( as measured in nanograms per milliliter ) raises a red flag , although a recent study suggests that a bigger threat is a PSA that rises quickly . ( See " Solving the PSA Puzzle , " on page 170 . ) <p> If the PSA score looks alarmingly elevated , the urologist will usually suggest a biopsy of the gland . Likewise if he detects a suspicious lesion during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissue is then analyzed under a microscope . If it 's found to be cancerous , the clinicians assign a Gleason score , which ranges from 2 to 10 and indicates the kind of cancer that 's present and whether it could aggressively spread to other parts of the body . This grading system , developed by pathologist Donald Gleason , M.D. , in 1977 , is used with a system of stages ( from 1 to 4 ) to steer a man to a preferred form of treatment . Depending on the cancer 's severity , a patient can choose from various options , such as a radical prostatectomy ( surgical removal of the gland ) , radiation therapy ( nuking the cancer ) , surgical castration ( removal of the testicles to halt the production of testosterone , which can fuel the cancer ) , hormone therapy ( sometimes called " chemical castration " ) , or a combination of these treatments . <p> When confronted with a PSA count of 7.0 , my father-in-law opted for a prostatectomy . Soon after , his PSA level dropped back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been beaten . For weeks , my father-in-law joked that he 'd avoided the ultimate male fear , " the snip-snip . " He pushed ahead with his active life , traveling from Los Angeles to New York City to see Ellen and me , and then on to Europe , where he lectured on schizophrenia and bipolar disorder  --  and found a way to fly in and out of Brussels , where his son lived , in order to dandle his new granddaughter on his knee . <p> What he did n't know was that his prostate cancer was n't beaten . It was hiding . " WE NOW THINK OF CANCER AS A GENETIC DISEASE . " <p> That 's William Isaacs , M.D. , a leading prostate-cancer researcher at Johns Hopkins University . According to Dr. Isaacs , 91 percent of all prostate cancers are sparked by DNA that becomes corroded over the course of a man 's life ( more on that in a moment ) . The other 9 percent are also triggered by a hiccup in the helix , except that this flaw is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a man younger than 55 develops prostate cancer , there 's a good chance that he has his dad to thank  --  more than 40 percent of those cases , researchers now believe , involve one of several mutant genes passed from fathers to sons . <p> Here 's another way to look at Dr. Isaacs 's breakdown : Nine in 10 men who develop prostate cancer were actually born with healthy genetic blueprints for their prostates . In these men , DNA damage results from what Dr. Isaacs calls " somatic changes triggered by environmental issues . " In other words , diet , smoking , lack of exercise  --  all the gremlins this magazine continually warns you about . <p> Another of these " environmental issues , " and potentially the most powerful of all , is infection . " Our natural immunities kill bacteria effectively  --  without them , we could n't live , " explains Dr. Isaacs . " But our immune responses are also potent in altering our own DNA over a lifetime . Call it ' collateral damage . ' " So , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies may inadvertently set the stage for another , more powerful opponent to rise from the glandular rubble . <p> The emerging hypothesis  --  researchers shy away from the word " consensus "  --  is that the presence and virulence of prostate cancer are intertwined with inflammation , the cellular signpost that indicates an immune reaction . And , oddly , the best tool for measuring prostate inflammation may be a heart test . <p> For several years now , smart cardiologists have been assessing their patients ' blood levels of C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , one of the body 's main inflammation markers . High levels  --  over 3 milligrams per liter  --  are generally considered to be a risk factor for a heart attack , since inflammation can signal the presence of arterial plaque . So doctors at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City theorized that if elevated CRP levels could predict heart trouble , then they might also help forecast prostate cancer . The docs were right : After analyzing the bloodwork of 114 men with prostate cancer , the researchers discovered that the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> More research is needed to confirm this connection , but the implications are significant . Not only might CRP testing be used as a tool for diagnosing prostate cancer , but it could also serve as an early-warning system that helps men avoid the disease . <p> Just as intriguing , says Dr. Isaacs , is how an out-of-whack immune response may figure into the inherited form of the disease . He had been studying families rife with prostate cancer for years when , in 2002 , he and his colleagues made a discovery on chromosome 1 . Through their analysis of about 200 families , they identified RNASEL , a gene that encodes an enzyme whose job it is to prevent viral infection . A mutation in the gene basically opens up a " pathway " to prostate inflammation . <p> Still , Dr. Isaacs believes that , unlike with BRCA1 , the gene whose mutated form almost always accurately predicts breast cancer , there 's no one genetic flaw that causes prostate cancer . " Prostate cancer may be more complex than breast cancer , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> I wonder aloud whether RNASEL or some other obscure genetic culprit caused my father-in-law 's death  --  after all , his own father suffered from the disease for years before succumbing in the ' 80s . When I mention my father-in-law 's case , Dr. Isaacs perks up . Apparently , even when you take DNA into account , it 's uncommon for a healthy , active man in his mid-60s to fall under the scythe of the disease in a matter of months . " Guys like your father-in-law . these guys fascinate us , " he says . " Clinically speaking , we really ca n't explain them . The example I always use is Frank Zappa , who was diagnosed at 52 and went quickly . " <p> I smile grimly to myself as Dr. Isaacs links these rare cases . He 's conjured a couple of fond adolescent memories : the famous Zappa album cover Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch ; the annoyingly catchy lyrics of " Valley Girl " blaring ubiquitously from Trans Am stereos in the summer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frank Zappa had lived in the Hollywood Hills , where on warm afternoons his children , Moon Unit and Dweezil , tagged along with other neighborhood kids , roaming the box canyons high above a blanket of smog . I now wonder if they remember one of their playmates , a slender , angular girl with parted Marcia Brady hair and a quick , sarcastic wit . <p> The girl who 'd one day become my wife . FOR A MAN WEANED ON HUSH PUPPIES AND BARBECUE , <p> I 've struggled with being married to a strict vegetarian , grumbling at the menu restrictions she 's cruelly imposed on me , such as steamed spinach and stir-fried tofu . In the long run , though , I may have her to thank for a healthy , cancer-free life . <p> A colleague of Dr. Isaacs , Bill Nelson , M.D. , has researched the role of diet in prostate cancer and offers a few rules to , in the fullest sense of the word , live by . First , given that the common denominator for the disease seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pounds the pulpit for foods whose chemistry can combat infection : fruits and vegetables  --  the " broccoli as cure for cancer " idea in vogue for the past decade . Noting that Southeast Asian men have much lower rates of prostate cancer  --  and that their first- and second-generation immigrant sons in Western countries have rates comparable to those of native-born Caucasians  --  he also preaches the Gospel of Soy . <p> " And think about taking supplements , like selenium and vitamin E , as well as such anti-inflammatory medications as aspirin and ibuprofen , " he says . And , for God 's sake , he notes , please avoid charbroiled meat ; carcinogens in it have been shown to disproportionately cause prostate cancer in lab studies . <p> Another way to reduce the risk is to engage the prostate 's self-cleaning cycle . Researchers in Australia recently queried more than 1,000 men with prostate cancer about their ejaculation rates and compared the results with data obtained from a comparable group of healthy men . These researchers discovered that men who ejaculated frequently between the ages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostate cancer . Even more provocatively , men in their 20s who ejaculated at least five times a week were one-third less likely to develop aggressive prostate cancer during their mature years . All those high-school P.E.-class jokes assume new meaning when I ponder the clear health benefits of chronic masturbation . <p> Conclusion : Prostate cancer can often be prevented through the basics of a healthy diet and vigorous exercise , whether one plays on an intramural basketball team or in the privacy of the bathroom with the skilled assistance of the December Playmate of the Month . <p> And if prevention fails ? Detection can succeed in saving us . <p> " The incidence in younger men is soaring , " observes Dr. Isaacs , " but only because detection methods have improved exponentially . " However , he adds , this also raises new questions . " How do we use screening effectively ? Are we overdiagnosing and overtreating , especially in younger patients ? There are so many controversial areas of prostate cancer . " <p> Like other clinicians , Dr. Petrylak feels the PSA test has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We need better , more specific tests at this point . " He frequently consults with David Bostwick , whose eponymous Bostwick Laboratories has identified a new marker in urine and has brought the first non-PSA test onto the market . <p> Created in the Netherlands by Jack Schalken , M.D. , the uPM3 test  --  " the first real prostate test to come out of the genomics revolution "  --  requires massaging of the prostate gland through a digital rectal examination . This dislodges cells and bits of tissue , which are then flushed out into the urine . The patient immediately heads off to the bathroom to pee into a special cup , where the expressed cells and tissues are collected . The urine specimen is then ferried to a lab , where clinicians must analyze the cell 's RNA within 72 hours  --  a more complicated and time-consuming process than looking at PSA , but also more likely to yield an accurate diagnosis . <p> The test 's specificity  --  its ability to identify the presence of cancer in a patient  --  has proved to be about 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove the absence of cancer , is likewise in the 80 percent range . The sensitivity of the PSA test also hovers in the 80 percent range , but its specificity never rises above 70 percent . <p> Dr. Bostwick says it 's an exciting time for early detection . By early 2006 , the next generation of the uPM3 test  --  called the PCA3  --  will debut on the market from numerous labs all over the world and will yield , he says , close to 100 percent accuracy . It may render the standard PSA test obsolete . <p> But that 's tomorrow . In my father-in-law 's case , the usual tools for detecting prostate cancer failed to uncover his disease . And then , despite the arsenal of weapons available , his urologist was unable to eradicate every last malignant cell . As I discovered , one cell is all it takes . <p> In a weird twist , the only treatment that might have offered my father-in-law any hope of survival was the same one that 's currently saving women by the score : the breast-cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the medication was surprisingly effective at combating late-term prostate cancer , prompting Dr. Petrylak to conduct his own trial . Last year , he published his results in the New England Journal of Medicine , in which he described the clear benefits of a chemotherapy regimen based on Taxotere . After cranking his data through various algorithms , he calculated a 20 percent spike in the survival rate among patients . Just as significant , he detailed dramatic improvements in quality of life , despite such debilitating side effects as osteoporosis and loss of sexual function . Dr. Petrylak acknowledges feeling a bittersweet pang when he hears a common refrain from his patients : " Doc , I feel like someone has taken the wind out of my sails . " <p> He 's now concentrating on enhancing the benefits of Taxotere with a second drug . In a new blind trial , he 'll develop a regimen for late-term prostate-cancer patients , combining Taxotere with Revlimid ; the latter is akin to thalidomide , the drug originally used in pregnant women in the late 1950s to temper morning sickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women had birth defects . Dr. Petrylak hopes that , taken in tandem , Taxotere and Revlimid will reduce the cancer 's toxicity and increase the efficacy of the treatment program . He expects the trial to grow to as many as 36 patients . <p> As much as I want Dr. Petrylak 's trial to be a success , what I want even more is to avoid becoming one of its participants . When I mention this to him , he concurs with Dr. Nelson 's recommendation : " A heart-healthy diet is a prostate-healthy diet . " More important , a man should undergo an annual prostate examination , with semiannual PSA tests , beginning at age 40 if there 's a strong family history of prostate cancer . <p> LAST FALL  --  calmly , uneventfully , with no abrupt outbreak of gray hair around the temples , no crow 's feet around the eyes  --  I passed the milestone of my 40th birthday . One evening some weeks later , my wife and I sat down on the couch after dinner , and while she watched over my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : blood pressure , cholesterol , colonoscopy , prostate exam . <p> The following afternoon , I was heading into Manhattan for my yearly physical , and I 'd made a solemn promise to my wife . <p> Ellen pushed a wing of hair out of her eyes . " You make sure you check in with Dr. Beautyman about everything . " <p> " I will . " <p> She rapped me on the shoulder . " That means a prostate exam , too . " <p> " Dr. B. will probably refer me to a urologist . " I knew that might take a while : the referral back-and-forth , the scheduling of an appointment , the rescheduling of the appointment because one of our newborn twin sons is sick . I had only a vague notion what the exam would entail but was content to put it off ad infinitum . With any luck , I could draw this out until my 41st birthday . <p> As I sat on the examination table the next afternoon , stripped to my skivvies under the paper gown , my strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tall , fashionable woman in her 50s , a silk skirt and Manolo Blahniks showing from beneath her lab coat . We exchanged small talk as she snaked her stethoscope across my chest and back , listening to my heart and lungs . The kids are all doing well , no real problems this year , weight 155 pounds , blood pressure up a smidgen but normal for a 40-year-old man . She asked me to stand and slip my boxer shorts to the floor , turn my head , and cough while she checked my testicles for a hernia . <p> As I tugged the shorts back up , relieved that I 'd gotten past that awkward moment , I broached the subject . " Now that I 'm 40 , Dr. Beautyman , do you recommend yearly prostate exams ? " <p> A frown creased her face . " Did your father have prostate cancer ? " " No , but he has had an elevated PSA count . My father-in-law actually died of it , an unusually virulent case . " <p> " I see , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor while making notes on my chart . I began to peel away the gown and reach toward the examination-room door , where my jeans , shirt , and peacoat hung from a hook . <p> " Do n't get dressed yet , " she said . She swiveled on her stool , stood , and placed the chart on top of the credenza . " Hop back onto the table and pull down your shorts , face the wall , and bring your knees to your chest . " She rummaged through the credenza 's lower drawer . <p> " I 'm sorry ? " <p> " Up on the table , " she said . I heard the thwack of a rubber glove . <p> I lay on my side with my face to the wall , slid my shorts down below my ankles , and with one arm hugged my knees to my chest . The wall was painted beige , that colorless color . <p> I felt her hand on my hip , steadying my rear end as she eased her fingers in and thrust forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted me an inch off the table 's vinyl surface . For an instant , I felt her squeeze deep inside me , palming the soft contours of a ball I 'd scarcely been aware I had . <p> A sharp pang of pain , a star shooting past the edge of sight . <p> " No suspicious lumps anywhere . You 're good to go until next year . " <p> She withdrew and I looked back quickly , saw a bright stain as she stripped off the glove and tossed it into a garbage canister . <p> " You can get dressed now . I 'll call you as soon as I get the blood-work back , " she said . " If there 's anything abnormal , we can discuss it then . " <p> Back home , I sat on the couch , a twin propped in the crook of each arm , their hands flailing about their faces in hunger . There was no residual soreness from the exam , no pain . And no cause for concern . I should be grateful . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voyage that would last the rest of my life , a quintessentially male experience , one shared by millions of men all over the world . I glanced down into the clear blue stares of my babies . Some day , I knew , they 'd join me in the journey .

What 's complicated is interpreting the results . <p> Last August , a study of 1,308 men published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute showed that even men with PSAs greater than 10.0 nanograms per milliliter ( ng/ml )  --  well above the 4.0 ng/ml danger threshold used by urologists  --  were biopsied for cancer that was n't there . This has led some doctors , such as Gilbert Welch , M.D. , M.P.H. , the lead study author , to argue for raising the PSA cutoff point . <p> Other scientists disagree . They point to a 2004 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine that found evidence of cancer in 15 percent of men with PSAs below 4.0 ng/ml . In this case , the magic number for disease detection would be 2.5 . <p> So where does this leave us ?

" If it goes up by as much as 2.0 ng/ml 3 months later , a biopsy is in order , " says Dr. D'Amico .

New laparoscopic techniques  --  with or without a hand from robotic arms  --  result in smaller cuts , minimizing recovery time . <p> HOW EFFECTIVE IS IT ? Among 2,091 men with tumors confined to the prostate , 72 percent stayed cancer-free for 10 years , according to a Johns Hopkins analysis . Laparoscopic techniques seem comparable . <p> ANY PROBLEMS ? Studies of patients in the mid-1990s found that 5 years later , roughly 80 percent had erectile problems , and 15 percent had leaky bladders . Today , new techniques can reduce those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in whom the tumor takes up at least 5 percent of the prostate but has n't spread beyond it . When compared with radiation therapy alone , it gives men whose cancer has advanced slightly past the gland 's perimeter a 79 percent chance of surviving an extra 10 years . Chemotherapy <p> Chemical warfare for cancer . This is any oral or intravenous drug that combats the disease . The most promising agent right now is the breast-cancer drug Taxotere , which stops malignant cells from multiplying . <p> HOW EFFECTIVE IS IT ? In studies published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine , men with hormone-resistant prostate cancer who were put on Taxotere-based regimens survived about 19 months , 2 to 3 months longer than men on chemo treatments that included mitoxantrone . <p> ANY PROBLEMS ? Nausea and vomiting , hair loss , diarrhea , mouth sores , and fatigue . <p> WHO IS IT BEST FOR ? Men whose spreading cancer does n't respond to radiation and is resistant to androgen deprivation . Radiation Therapy <p> Call it the nuclear option . High-energy x-rays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill cancer cells . <p> HOW EFFECTIVE IS IT ? Men younger than 60 treated with external-beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) had a 7-year cancer-free survival rate near 80 percent , say researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center . Younger men treated with radioactive seeds had a better than 90 percent chance of staying cancer-free after 7 years , according to a separate study . <p> ANY PROBLEMS ? It 's estimated that half of men become impotent 5 years after EBRT . A study in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology found that 1 year after seeding , 60 percent of men report bladder-control problems , and 80 percent experience impotence . <p> WHO IS IT BEST FOR ? Men with gland-confined cancer that 's at low risk of spreading who do n't want or ca n't have surgery . The drawback to radiation is that it takes years to know for certain if the cancer is still active . Cryosurgery <p> Guided by ultrasound , doctors slide several hollow probes into the gland , then pump in ultracold ( below - 40F ) liquid . The prostate is then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EFFECTIVE IS IT ? This generation of cryo is still new , but a study of 590 Michigan hospital patients with organ-confined or locally advanced cancer put their odds of remaining cancer-free at between 60 and 70 percent after 7 years . ANY PROBLEMS ? <p> " You have to freeze the area slightly outside the prostate to get rid of any cancer in the margins , " says Judd Moul , M.D. , chief of urologic surgery at Duke University medical center . " That can damage the nerves that control erections . " Freezing may also create a hole between the rectum and the bladder , which can cause urine leaks . <p> WHO IS IT BEST FOR ? Men whose prostate cancer has returned following radiation therapy . " You can freeze a prostate even after it 's been irradiated , " says Dr. Moul . Androgen Deprivation <p> A euphemism for the C word  --  castration  --  either with drugs or , in very advanced cases , surgery . The goal is to suppress the supply of testosterone and other androgen-based hormones that can fuel prostate cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ androgen deprivation combined with external radiation treatment can improve survival in men whose cancer either is likely to spread just outside the gland or already has . It can also ease bone pain and urinary obstructions . <p> ANY PROBLEMS ? Hot flashes , breast growth , shrinking muscle mass , fatigue , depression , weight gain , and decreased HDL cholesterol . <p> WHO IS IT BEST FOR ? Men with cancer that 's likely to spread and who are receiving radiation , and men with advanced cancer who suffer from bone pain . " Hormone therapy usually does n't cure , but it keeps the cancer down for a while , " says Paul Lange , M.D. , chairman of urology at the University of Washington school of medicine . Expectant Management <p> The option formerly known as " watchful waiting . " In cases in which the cancer is extremely small and slow growing , your doctor may monitor your condition , waiting to begin treatment until symptoms appear or the cancer progresses . <p> HOW EFFECTIVE IS IT ? As long as the cancer stays put , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANY PROBLEMS ? You need a digital rectal exam and a PSA measurement every 6 months , and needle biopsies at 6 and 18 months , or more frequently . <p> WHO IS IT BEST FOR ? Men with a very small amount of cancer who are in a low-risk category , says Dr. Lange . " If you 're in your 40s , I would say no ; if you 're in your 60s , it can be an option .
