<p> CERRITOS , Calif.  --  Sure , the Nissan Quest minivan that Gino Shnayderman was sizing up looked a tad bigger than the older Toyota model it would replace . But that was OK . In his mind , more room meant it will carry more people . <p> " Would n't you want to get more ? " Shnayderman asked as his dad circled the used Quest on the lot of a Honda dealer here in this Los Angeles suburb . <p> Lots of automakers think they know the answer . Despite high gas prices , the industry believes consumers view bigger as better . Cars and trucks have ballooned as a result . <p> Models getting the XXL treatment range from Audi 's previously tiny TT sports car to the venerable Ford Taurus sedan among next-generation models . Even BMW 's Mini is going to offer a maxi version . <p> The average 2007 midsize SUV has grown 10 inches in length , 4 inches in width and gained 474 pounds over the past decade , according to Edmunds.com , an auto-buying research site . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches wider and 374 pounds heavier than in 1997 . Midsize and large sedans weigh hundreds of pounds more as well . <p> Some cars have grown so much that they 've switched size classifications . The 2007 Honda Civic has nearly the same legroom as a 1990 Accord , the model that 's traditionally the next size up . The old Accord and current Civic weigh within about 100 pounds of each other . Later this year , the Accord will strike back , becoming even bigger just as it has in every previous redesign . <p> Automakers say they are just catering to the desires of customers . Boosting the size of vehicles helps foster brand loyalty as buyers stick with models they know and love even as their incomes and wants rise . " They 'll say , ' I love the Rio . I just wish it were a little bit bigger , ' " says Len Hunt , executive vice president of Kia Motors America , referring to his brand 's entry-level subcompact . <p> For further validation they need go no further than research they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which measures the top reasons why customers walk away from a showroom . For every year the study was conducted since 2001 , Power found twice as many consumers rejected models as being too small as rejected them for being too big . <p> The more-for-the-money mentality has been ingrained in auto executives for decades . " Have you ever been at a press event and heard them say , ' We 've shrunk the car this year ! ' Nobody wants to say their car is getting smaller , " says Edmunds.com editor Karl Brauer . <p> The industry 's fascination with big comes at an awkward time , given how gas prices have escalated . More weight requires more horsepower , and consequently more fuel , to propel a vehicle . Last month , the Senate voted to increase fuel standards for the first time since 1975 . The measure , which must pass in the House , would require an automaker 's lineup to average 35 miles a gallon by 2020 , up from the current 27.5 mpg . <p> Despite the growth in vehicle size , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest government figures show , about the same as in 1986 . Automakers have done that by equipping their bigger models with new , high-technology engines . In some cases , the newer , bigger cars and trucks actually get better mileage than the smaller models they replaced . <p> Of course , the models conceivably could have gotten even better mileage if their sizes and weights had been maintained from the previous generation . <p> " I do n't hear people running around complaining their minivan is n't big enough . But I do hear them complaining their gas costs have increased compared to a few years ago , " says David Friedman , research director for the vehicles program at the Union of Concerned Scientists . <p> Some buyers have rebelled against bloat . Sales of medium and large SUVs have fallen while sales of crossovers , which offer comparable space but often with less weight and better fuel economy , have increased . <p> " It 's bad to get bigger . It costs more for gas . It costs more to park , " says Ken Pham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , standing on the sidewalk in front of Cerritos Ford where his wife was inspecting a row of new Mustangs . <p> On the other hand , Toyota Camry and Honda Accord have remained the best-selling cars in the USA for years even as they 've gotten bigger . <p> Americans have a love affair with big <p> All things oversized are favored by many Americans , whether it 's cars , houses or pork chops . <p> A survey of 300 chefs found that most are serving up food portions two to four times what the government recommends , the Obesity Society was told last year . The government says two-thirds of Americans now rank as overweight or obese , defined as being more than 30 pounds beyond their healthy weight . <p> " Let 's face it . Americans are getting bigger , " says Ian Beavis , Kia 's lean marketing chief when asked about how cars are gradually being upsized , including several Kia models . <p> The average American home completed during the first nine months of 2006 had 2,459 square feet , up from about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Home Builders reports . <p> They may be feeding American appetites , but it is n't only the American-based automakers leading the automotive bulk-up . <p> Toyota , despite its industry reputation for fuel economy , is one of the most brazen . Its smallest SUV , the RAV4 , gained 14.5 inches in length , 3 inches in width in its 2006 redesign , encroaching on the domain of the midsize Highlander . Toyota fixed that problem by stretching the Highlander another 4 inches , adding 3 inches to its width . Next up , Toyota is expected to unveil an even bigger Sequoia full-size model . <p> Toyota continues to upsize some of its smaller vehicles as well . The new Scion xB  --  what was previously an odd , boxy vehicle sometimes compared to a rolling microwave oven for the seriously hip  --  grew a foot longer , 3 inches wider and more than 600 pounds heavier when it recently went on sale . As a result , it consumes 14% more gas than the model it replaces . <p> Toyota offers the same reason as most automakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our customers , " says spokesman Bill Kwong . And , he says , they often want bigger vehicles . <p> To give customers what they want , automakers have found ways of moving models around to try to get their size mix just right . Some of the tactics include : <p> *New small models at the bottom . As Chevrolet , Toyota , Honda and Nissan have seen their average car sizes grow , they realized they no longer offered the smallest of entry-level cars . Enter Aveo , Yaris , Fit and Versa , all introduced in the last couple of years to cater to a boomlet of Generation Y college students and other budget-conscious buyers . <p> General Motors ditched its Chevy Cavalier compact to replace it with two models : the smaller Aveo and the larger Cobalt . <p> *New big models at the top . Ford stopped making the midsize Taurus sedan last year . Rather than shelve a famous name , it handed the moniker to the redesigned , but slow-selling Five Hundred . That means the new Taurus is 4 inches longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous one , even though they get about the same mileage . <p> BMW 's Mini brand had its own problem . Executives felt they were losing sales to buyers who wanted a slightly larger , yet still sporty , car . The result will be the new Clubman , a Mini that 's 9 inches longer , to be introduced next year . " It 's for somebody who likes Mini but just needs a little extra space , " says spokesman Andrew Cutler . <p> *Bigger models , less weight . Ford plans to hold the weight and size line on the redesign of its Focus subcompact , due out later this year . Actually , it will be lighter than the version it replaces , which should help improve fuel economy . <p> Audi may have found the perfect solution . Its new TT sports car is 5 inches longer and 3 inches wider than the first-generation model it replaces . But because it makes more extensive use of lightweight aluminum in its frame instead of steel , the new TT is 22 pounds lighter and gets better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the extra length , Audi spokesman Patrick Hespen says it was partly due to wanting to create a more stable ride . But from a competitive standpoint , the TT has more rivals than before , such as Nissan 350Z , Mercedes SLK and Porsche Cayman . TT will be sized right alongside the others . <p> Ford went through the same exercise when it was designing the Fusion sedan , which was introduced last year . An internal company document showed how car models of all major makers are positioned on a matrix . The grid showed that the future Fusion would be positioned to compete alongside the toughest competitors in the class , chiefly Accord and Camry . <p> Ford spokesman Jim Cain says the automaker learned the importance of position after the original midsize Taurus slipped out of the " sweet spot " of optimal size by not keeping up with those ever-growing Japanese models . <p> " If you have a midsize car that 's a little too small , you might be limiting your ( sales ) volume potential . That 's why you tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clustered around this ratio , " he says . <p> Out on the Cerritos Auto Square sales lots , customer Shnayderman , 44 , a truck driver from Long Beach , Calif. , was trying to be careful to find the right size minivan . He did n't mind that the Nissan was bigger  --  7 inches longer and 500 pounds heavier  --  than his dad 's old Toyota Previa . <p> " Everybody likes the square footage , " he said . " It 's second nature . " <p> Three decades of growth <p> Honda has added more than 20 inches ( about the length of this page ) and 1,000 pounds to the four-door Accord since its inception in 1979 . It 's been redesigned for 2008 . You can expect the growth spurt to continue , as it has in other cars . <p> 2007 <p> Length Weight Mileage 191.1 inches 3,197 pounds 24 City 34 Hwy <p> 2002 <p> Length Weight Mileage 188.8 inches 3,097 pounds 23 City 30 Hwy <p> 1992 <p> Length Weight Mileage 185.2 inches 2,932 pounds 22 City 28 Hwy <p> 1988 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 Hwy <p> 1984 <p> Length Weight Mileage 175.4 inches 2,372 pounds 29 City 41 Hwy <p> 1979 <p> Length Weight Mileage 171.9 inches 2,208 pounds 24 City 28 Hwy <p> GRAPHIC , B/W , Source : Edmunds.com ( CHART ) PHOTO , Color , Wieck ( 5 ) PHOTOS , B/W , Wiek ( 2 ) PHOTOS , B/W , Toyota ( 2 )
