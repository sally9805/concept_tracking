The King 's Mercy Someone was shaking me out of a fitful sleep . I opened my eyes and saw very little more than darkness with only a faint flicker of crimson . The man who had one hand on my shoulder was , with the other hand , holding up a lantern with a stubby inadequate candle in it . In the dark , stinking orlop of the merchant ship Louisa , the candle burned so ill that it was more a glow , feeble and red , than a light . " David Shea ! " the figure slurred , his gin-soaked breath as much as his voice revealing him to be the Reverend Mr. Bonney . " David Shea ! Wake up ! We 're anchored in Port Royal ! Stir your lazy shanks , boy ! " Groaning , I swung out of my hammock . My bare feet hit the splintery wood of the deck , and I heard a skitter in the darkness . " What 's that ? " I asked . " Just rats , David , just some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sailors hunted them , killed them , and ate them . Six weeks at sea had not yet given me a taste for rat . " Here ! " The Reverend Mr. Bonney shoved a bundle into my hands . Even half-asleep , I recognized it . It was my canvas seabag , and it held my few worldly possessions : two shirts , two pair of breeches , smallclothes , stockings , and the suit and pair of shoes the good Mr. Horne had bought for me to wear to my mother 's funeral . Those , and the clothes I stood in , were all I owned . Mr. Bonney shook me again . " Are you awake ? " " Yes , sir , " I said . The minister gave me a rough shove . " Lazy , like all boys . That wo n't do now , lad . You 'll need your wits about you . " Mr. Bonney reached into his pocket and then shook a smallgray cloth purse in my face . It jangled . " And you 'll need this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep for you . " Before I could take it , he 'd thrust it deep into my seabag , pulled the drawstring tight , and tied it . " There , that 'll keep it safe for you . On deck , now . Look lively , look lively ! It 's just touch and go here . " He led the way aft , then up a narrow companionway . I followed , hoping for fresher air  --  for I was heartily sick of the sweaty , smelly atmosphere of the closed-in lower deck the sailors called the orlop . But we were fairly in the Caribbees , on the southern coast of Jamaica , and the night was tropical , heavy , and moist . I looked up at the dark sky . Thin clouds half-hid a waxing moon , making it a smudged white thumbprint on the face of the night . No stars at all . Mr. Bonney hauled at my arm . " Here he is ! " " Sir  --  Mr. Bonney , " I said desperately , " where am I to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sharp odor of gin poured over me again . " Doing some wild , papish , heathenish business , no doubt . " The minister was on his way to preach the Gospel on some island or other . Mr. Horne had assured me that Mr. Bonney would take care of me during our voyage . So far as I could tell , his " taking care " of me consisted merely of constantly losing small sums of money playing at dice or cards with the sailors , drinking too much , and looking sour each time he saw me . He pulled me toward a group of men at the rail and growled , " He 's said to stay at the inn called The King 's Mercy . That is in Thames Street , and that is all I know . You men , there ! Here he is at last , the nasty little slug ! " Four sailors were loading a boat drawn up tight against the Louisa 's larboard side . In the boat , two others manhandled the kegs and boxes into place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried one of the sailors on deck , and from his voice I recognized him as Dennis O'Leary , who had a kindness for me because we both were Irish . " It 's not so far a step down . " Even so , I was glad enough that O'Leary swung me down from above and someone in the boat guided my legs from below . I dropped into the boat and took my place between a keg of nails and a pouch of mail , just visible in the light of the lanterns up on deck . As the last articles were stowed , I looked across the dark bay . Two or three ships lay at anchor closer in , their stern lanterns yellow flickers in the darkness . Beyond them loomed the town of Port Royal , dark blocks of buildings with here and there a dim window lit by a candle or a lantern within . " That 's all , " O'Leary shouted down . " Row dry . " Without a word , the men in the boat pushed off from the ship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall I find The King 's Mercy , then ? " One of the men at the oars chuckled . " At the end of a rope ! " The others roared at this witticism . I sat there in the little boat , feeling abandoned . My temporary guardian had vanished , but Dennis O'Leary took pity on me . " From the dock take the left hand turning , " He called across the water . " Follow the street until you see the sign . ' Twill be on your starboard side , Davy Shea . " " And can you read the sign when you see it ? " the other oarsman in the boat asked me , his tone amused . " Sure , and I can read well enough . Mr. Horne taught me , and he a professor from Oxford and all . " " You can read ? " the first boatman asked me in surprise . " How old are you ? " " Twelve . Almost twelve , " I corrected , for I always told the truth , when convenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that . Not another word did they say to me until we bumped up to a pier . Then one leaped out and made the boat fast , bow and stern , and the other said , " Off you go , now , Davy Shea . Your course is larboard and bear straight until you see the sign . And the luck of the sea go with you ! " The land felt strange under my feet after so many weeks at sea . I must have staggered like a sailor who had taken more rum than his head could carry , but bearing my bundle , I walked down the pier and made my turn . All was as still and dark as it could well be . I had it in mind to ask what o'clock it was , but the boatmen were busy unloading . It had the feel of three or four in the dead of morning , though . The street about me seemed full asleep . I walked on , the hard-packed sand of the street feeling rough beneath my bare feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about with white or pale green moths the size of my hand . The night smelled different from nights in Bristol , where my mother had reared me after my father died . I could smell the familiar fishy , salty ocean , but also something sweet and spicy . The warehouses I passed , looming out of the darkness , gave out other smells , too : dry cotton , tobacco , and molasses . Once away from the docks and the loading and unloading , everything was still and warm , and the whole place seemed less like a town and more like a great sea beast slumbering . At last I saw ahead a sign hanging over a door , and over the sign a lantern . I had just passed an alley when I heard a growl behind me . My heart thudded into my throat , and I spun around like a leaf in a gale , nearly crouching to the earth in my alarm . From the dark alley , a dog had crept . I could not well see him , for the hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a shadowy dark shape , snarling and growling at me . I could tell he was a big one , though , and I caught the white flash of his bared teeth . " Get away ! " I yelled , hoping my voice did not show as much fear as I felt . The dog barked at me savagely , remarkably unimpressed . I had it in mind that so unpleasant a creature probably had known rocks to be thrown at him . Quickly I stooped , grabbed a handful of air , and raised my arm back . " Go ! " Sure enough , the mongrel flinched away . I raised my arm higher , and he turned and trotted off a piece . Then he stopped and growled back over his shoulder at me . I stamped the earth and pretended to throw a stone , and the coward of a cur ran back into his alley . I turned on my heel and made good time down Thames Street , toward the next lantern . In its light , the sign creaked back and forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The King 's Mercy , " painted in bold red letters . And dangling from the sign , as it would from a gallows , swung a hangman 's noose . King James 's mercy at the end of a rope . The boatman had not been just making a joke , after all . But the lantern aside , the whole house was dark , and I hesitated to pound upon the door . It could not be long until daybreak , I told myself . So I stuffed my seabag behind me for comfort 's sake , settled in the doorway , and leaned back to wait . Saints in heaven , but I was weary . I told myself not to sleep , though . The big mongrel dog might come back . But it was probably safe just to sit quietly and rest . Closing my eyes , I thought with a pang of my poor mother . My father I could hardly remember , for he had served in the king 's army and was rarely home . Up until the previous March , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother worked as a housekeeper for old Mr. Horne . I thought of him as the learned man of the world . Mr. Horne had retired from teaching years and years before and had come to live in a small little house that his father had left him . He was spindly as a cricket , and to me he seemed a hundred years old , though I am sure he could not really have been past eighty . But he was not testy toward young people , as the old often are . He took a real interest in me , and we always spent an hour or more every day , him teaching me my letters and my numbers , and then listening to me read , or correcting what I wrote . Mr. Horne was an old bachelor with no family to speak of , but he treated me like a favorite grandson for all that . I do believe that he would have taken me into his family by adoption after my mother died in March , if he had not been so very ancient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found out where my doctor uncle , Patrick Shea , had gone to live , and it was he who had bought me passage and had given me a present of money on the day that we sailed for Jamaica . Despite all the heat and all my fever at being ashore again , I shivered there , leaning against the door of the King 's Mercy . My Uncle Patrick . Even the very words sounded strange . My mother had rarely spoken of her brother-in-law , and I knew nothing about him , other than he had studied medicine at Trinity College in Dublin and had qualified as a surgeon . My understanding was that he had gone off to sea at about the time my father and mother married  --  some disagreement had risen between the brothers Shea , I gathered , but Lord knows what its nature might have been . And now I was to live with him here , on this strange island . A dog howled somewhere , far off . I relaxed a bit . If it was my mongrel , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spun in a storm around the lantern . The island air seemed too warm , and the creaking sign almost like a clock ticking . My eyelids felt as if they were made of lead . To keep myself occupied , I began to whisper a prayer for my mother 's soul . After one or two repetitions , I began to jumble the words . I closed my eyes to help me better concentrate , and before I knew it , the prayer trailed off and sleep crept in , and I dropped into a dream of my mother singing an old Irish song to me.
