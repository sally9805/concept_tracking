Deep Fathom Chapter One Nautilus July 24 , 3:35 P.M. 75 miles SW of Wake Island , Central Pacific Jack Kirkland had missed the eclipse . Where he glided , there was no sun , only the perpetual darkness of the ocean 's abysmal deep . The sole illumination came from a pair of xenon lamps set in the nose of his one-man submersible . His new toy , the Nautilus 2000 , was out on its first deep-dive test . The eight-foot titanium minisub was shaped like a fat torpedo topped by an acrylic plastic dome . Attached to its underside was a stainless steel frame that mounted the battery pods , thruster assembly , that mounted the battery pods , thruster assembly , electrical , can , and lights . Ahead , the brilliance of the twin lamps drilled a cone of visibility that extended a hundred feet in front of him . He fingered the controls , sweeping the arc back and forth , searching . Out the corner of his eye he checked the analog depth gauge . Approaching fifteen hundred feet . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the computer screen confirmed his assessment . Nomore than two fathoms . The pings of the sonar grew closer and closer . Seated , Jack 's head and shoulders protruded into the acrylic plastic dome of the hull , giving him a panoramic view of his surroundings . While the cabin was spacious for most men , it was a tight fit for Jack 's six-foot-plus frame . It 's like driving an MG convertible , he thought , except you steer with your toes . The two foot pedals in the main hull controlled not only acceleration , but also maneuvered the four one-horsepower thrusters . With practiced skill Jack eased the right pedal while depressing the toe of the left pedal . The craft dove smoothly to the left . Lights swept forward . Ahead , the seabed came into view , appearing out of the endless gloom . Jack slowed his vehicle to a gentle glide as he entered a natural wonderland , a deep ocean oasis . Under him , fields of tubeworms lay spread across the valley floor of the mid-Pacific mountain range . Riftia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worms were like an otherworldly topiary waving at him as he passed , gently swaying in the current . To either side , on lower slopes , giant clams lay stacked shell-to-shell , open , soft fronds filtering the sea . Among them stalked bright red galatheid crabs on long , spindly legs . Movement drew Jack 's attention forward . A thick eyeless eel slithered past , teeth bright in the xenon lamp . A school of curious fish followed next , led by a large brown lantern fish . The brazen fellow swam right up to the glass bubble , a deepsea gargoyle ogling the strange intruder inside . Minuscule bioluminescent lights winked along the large fish 's sides , announcing its territorial aggression . Other denizens displayed their lights . Under him , pink pulses ran through tangles of bamboo coral . Around the dome , tiny blue-green lights flashed , the creatures too small and translucent to be seen clearly . The sight reminded Jack of flurries of fireflies from his Tennessee childhood . Having lived all his young life in landlocked Tennessee , Jack had instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide expanses , its endless blue , its changing moods . A swirl of lights swarmed around the dome . " Unbelievable , " he muttered to himself , wearing a wide grin . Even after all this time , the sea found ways to surprise him . In response , his radio earpiece buzzed . " What was that , Jack ? " Frowning , Jack silently cursed the throat microphone taped under his larynx . Even fifteen hundred feet under the sea , he could not completely shut out the world above . " Nothing , Lisa , " he answered . " Just admiring the view . " " How 's the new sub handling ? " " Perfectly . Are you receiving the Bio-Sensor readings ? " Jack asked , touching the clip on his earlobe . The laser spectrometer built into the clip constantly monitored his bloodgas levels . Dr. Lisa Cummings had garnered a National Science Foundation grant to study the physiological effects of deepsea work . " Respiration , temperature , cabin pressure , oxygen supply , ballast , carbon dioxide scrubbers . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No . All quiet . " Two hours ago , as Jack had first begun his descent in the Nautilus , Charlie Mollier , the geologist , had reported strange seismic readings , , harmonic vibrations radiating through the deep-sea mountain range . For safety 's sake he had suggested that Jack return to the surface . " Come watch the eclipse with us , " Charlie had radioed earlier in his Jamaican accent . " It 's spectacular , mon . We can always dive tomorrow . " Jack had refused . He had no interest in the eclipse . If the quakes worsened , he could always surface . But during the long descent , the strange seismic readings had faded away . Charlie 's voice over the radio had eventually lost its strained edge . Jack touched his throat mike . " So you all done worrying up there ? " A pause was followed by a reluctant " Yes . " Jack imagined the blond doctor rolling her eyes . " Thanks , Lisa . Signing off . Time for a little privacy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a small victory . The remainder of the Bio-Sensor system would continue to report on the sub 's environmental status , but not his personal information . At least it gave him a bit of isolation from the world above  --  and this was what Jack liked best about diving . The isolation , the peace , the quiet . Here there was only the moment . Lost in the deep , his past had no power to haunt him . From the sub 's speakers the strange noises of the abysmal deep echoed through the small space : a chorus of eerie pulses , chirps , and high-frequency squeals . It was like listening in on another planet . Around him was a world deadly to surface dwellers : endless darkness , crushing pressures , toxic waters . But life somehow found a way to thrive here , fed not by sunlight , but by poisonous clouds of hydrogen sulfide that spewed from hot vents called " black smokers . "                   @ @
