YOUNG AND UNPREPARED FOR THE DEMANDS OF MARRIAGE , SINGER KELLY PRICE AND HER HUSBAND , JEFFREY ROLLE , FOUND STAYING TOGETHER A DAILY STRUGGLE // After ten years of marriage , Def Soul R &B; recording artist Kelly Price and her husband and manager , Jeffrey Rolle , are living the kind of fairy-tale existence people dream about : successful careers , a beautiful home and a supportive network of family and friends . On July 20 of this year , the couple renewed their vows in a lavish four-day celebration that publicly expressed their deep emotional bond . But each admits there were times over the past decade when their dream life was a nightmare . When Kelly , 29 , and Jeffrey , 31 , look back on their early years , they marvel at how much they 've overcome-from a teen pregnancy for which neither was prepared to having few role models who could teach them how to make marriage work . At ages 19 and 21 , Kelly and Jeffrey were n't mature enough to know how to navigate the peaks and valleys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of all , dedication to the family and life they had built together , the Atlanta couple might never have made it this far Kelly and Jeffrey , who were both raised in strict Pentecostal homes , first met at a national church conference for young people in 1986 . Kelly , then 13 , was n't allowed to date , but she and 16-year-old Jeffrey became friends . Over time , their friendship blossomed into a relationship that eventually led to a marriage proposal . " Jeff and I were best friends for a long time , so when the question of marriage came up , I thought , Who better to marry than your best friend ? " says Kelly . Still , Jeffrey had to propose three times before she accepted . " The first time I was 17 years oldtoo young-and I thought he was just clowning around , " she recalls . " The second time he proposed I was 18 , and I felt neither one of us was ready . When he asked me again later that year , I finally accepted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while with no rush . " But before they made it to the altar , Kelly learned that Jeffrey had fathered a child outside their relationshiphis daughter Kyazia , now age 11 . Betrayed and confused , Kelly was no longer optimistic about their future . " I was so hurt and had my reservations about marrying him , " she says . " But there was pressure on us because I was pregnant . Both our mothers were preachers at the time and were active members in the church . Had things been different , I 'm sure we would have waited . " Photograph For a long time , my attitude was , I can take care of myself . I had to learn how to share , ' says Kelly ( above ) . // To help them sort things out , the two sought counseling from Jeffrey 's uncle , Bishop Jasper Rolle of New York City 's Abundant Life Tabernacle in the South Bronx . " I tried to reinforce for them the importance of putting God first in their lives , " says Rolle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ask God to strengthen them so that they could rise to the challenges they would face . " After some hard thinking , the couple decided to go ahead with the planned nuptials . They opted for a justice-of-the-peace affair rather than a traditional ceremony . Looking back now , it 's obvious to them that from the beginning they were unprepared for the demands of married life . Kelly , who was raised in a single-parent home after her father abandoned the family , had always been independent . At the tender age of 6 , she was cooking and caring for her sisters while her mom , Claudia Norman Pratcher , then an elementary-school teacher , struggled to provide for her three daughters . Making the transition from being the one in charge to sharing a home and the decision making with her husband was difficult for Kelly . " I could n't stand it at first , " she admits . " Every little thing , from leaving the toilet seat up to leaving the toothpaste cap off , drove me crazy . " In frustration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time my attitude was , If he does n't act right , it does n't matter because I do n't need him , and I can take care of myself And I always let him know it , " Kelly says . " But you cant go into a relationship with that attitude because you 're doomed to fail . You 're not giving yourself an opportunity to mesh and become one with that person , to need that person . I had to learn how to share my emotions and not worry about being vulnerable to somebody else . " It did n't help matters that Kelly 's burgeoning career as a background vocalist for Mariah Carey and studio work with Mary J. Blige , Faith Evans , Aretha Franklin and Brian McKnight took her away from home for weeks and months at a time . Fortunately , Jeffrey supported Kelly and her musical aspirations . " Jeff has always been a wonderful father . When I traveled , he took care of the kids , " says Kelly . On those occasions when Kelly was at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children , Jeffrey , Jr. , 10 , and daughter Jonia , 9 . ( Kyazia came to live with the family earlier this year . ) But once her career took off and Kelly became a solo artist , the situation between the couple worsened . Although Jeffrey became Kelly 's manager , their new business relationship did n't bring them any closer . " Jeff was neglected in a lot of ways , which made it even harder to repair what was wrong , " Kelly says . As her **46;1698;TOOLONG mentality intensified , Jeffrey , who was also raised by his mother in a single-parent home , began to feel emasculated and sought refuge from his wife 's rejection . Instead of expressing his innermost feelings , he withdrew and began frequenting local nightclubs with his " boys , " who were mostly single and often introduced him to women . While he never had an affair , Jeffrey admits to some emotional cheating . " You can only hear " I do n't need you " so many times before you start asking yourself , Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to be married and single at the same time . It 's just not possible . I realize now it was immature of me to engage other women in intimate and flirtatious conversation just because they made me feel needed after I 'd been told I was n't needed at home . " The lines of communication between Kelly and Jeffrey continued to shut down , with the two sharing a home yet barely speaking two words to each other . The tension began to take its toll on their children . " When we would argue , the whole tone in my house would change , " says Jeffrey . Their daughter , Jonia , appeared to remain neutral , but Jeffrey , Jr. , would cling to his mom and question his father to find out what the problem was . " I knew we could n't go on like that much longer , " Jeffrey remembers . Not knowing where to turn , Jeffrey recalled his Uncle Rolle 's words of advice and began to lean on his faith . He prayed and asked God for guidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I changed , none of this was going to work , " he says . It was then that he rededicated himself to his wife and family . " I decided I was going to make her and the kids happy , " he says simply . Jeffrey started with his friends , letting go of those who had become a distraction to him and his marriage . He also began to discuss his feelings more freely with Kelly . She however , needed time to adjust to Jeffrey 's newfound commitment . " I was glad he came around , but I needed time to heal , " she explains . Kelly took a couple of solo trips , trying to decide if she wanted to go on with their marriage . " It was more about me at the time , " she admits . " But I 'd known Jeff for so long that I knew when he was being serious . I decided that together we had something worth saving . " So Kelly and Jeffrey started from scratch-as friends . They began dating without the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept the individuals they had each become . " Because Jeff had been my friend before we were ever intimate , I knew how to change the tone of our relationship , " she says . For Kelly , the timing of the reconciliation was a godsend . She was under considerable stress at work , facing legal battles with fellow artists and a fluctuating weight problem that threatened her career . She was also struggling to keep the family nucleus intact in an industry that , she says , is not supportive of family time . " If I was on the road for six weeks , I would send for mv kids , " says Kelly . " But record-label folks always asked me , Why do you need your kids ? ' I 'm like , Hello , I have n't seen them in six weeks . ' " Knowing that Jeffrey was in her corner made everything easier . " That time was crucial for us , " she reflects . " I needed my best friend more than ever , and we were there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then how much their decision to stick together would mean to them . Within three months , Jeffrey lost his mother to breast cancer and Kelly 's mom discovered a lump in her breast that fortunately was benign . Facing these traumatic experiences together helped the couple put aside past hurts and focus on valuing their lives together . They made a commitment always to resolve their problems openly , and right away . " My mother used to say , Kelly , do n't let the sun go down upon your wrath , ' " the songs tress says with a laugh . " We 're adamant about not bringing our problems to our resting place . We do n't go to sleep angry . " Photograph " I realized that until I changed , none of this was going to work . I decided I was going to make her and the kids happy , ' says Jeffrey , above with Kelly and ( left to right ) Jonia , Jeffrey , Jr. , and Kyazia. // Kelly and Jeffrey are also more conscientious about making time for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was happy when she agreed to take a quick trip to Vegas , " laughs Jeff . " We did n't take anything-no luggage , car , kids , nothing . It was really refreshing and fun . " The rededication ceremony the couple hosted on Saturday , July 20 , 2002 , was the culmination of a decade-long journey full of highs and lows . Kelly and Jeffrey stood before 300 invited family and friends at Bishop E. Long 's New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Decatur , Georgia . " They have been through an awful lot , " says Kelly 's mom . " Other folks would have fallen apart and left . But they decided , We are going to stay together no matter what . ' I 've seen the growth . I commend them . " The vows that Kelly and Jeffrey wrote were full of appreciation for where they 've been and hope for where they 're going . " My gift to you is the promise of a new smile , a new touch and new ways to say " I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy , " Kelly pledged , continuing , " Thank you for the good times and the not-so-good times . They were equally important in molding the Kelly who stands before you today . " In Jeffrey 's vows , he expressed his gratitude to her for loving him unconditionally . Before the ceremony ended , Kelly serenaded her husband with " He Proposed , " a song she had written especially for him , from her current album , Priceless . As he watched his wife perform , Jeffrey was filled with the love and wonder he had felt for her when he was a 21-year-old , but now those emotions were tempered with the strength and wisdom of a married man . Kelly and Jeffrey may have started out their relationship as teenagers who had yet to come into their own , but together they have matured into adults who have learned how to handle the ups and downs of marriage . For them , love is better the second time around , and they believe their life together is a living testimony . " We have a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains , 11 which means our love is infinite .
