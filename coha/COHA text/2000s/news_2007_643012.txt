<p> NEWARK  --  They 're three friends from Newark 's inner city who demolished the stereotypes , overcame the odds and became doctors and authors . <p> They called themselves " The Three Doctors . " Their third book , The Bond : Three Young Men Learn to Forgive and Reconnect With Their Fathers ( Riverhead , $24.95 ) , arrives Thursday . <p> That also happens to be the birthday of Rameck Hunt 's father , Alim Bilal . An ex-con and former drug addict , Bilal belatedly put his life together , inspired by his son 's success . <p> " The publisher did n't know it was his birthday , " Hunt says . " It 's spooky in a way , but maybe it 's a sign : that it 's a book that was meant to be . " <p> Hunt , Sampson Davis and George Jenkins , all 34 , grew up in broken homes . As they tell it , their mothers and grandmothers did all the heavy lifting of being parents . Their fathers were mostly absent . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest is not : The three friends pledged in their senior year of high school that they would all go to college , then on to medical school . <p> They did , and they wrote about it in their 2002 best seller , The Pact : Three Young Men Make a Promise and Fulfill a Dream . A children 's version , We Beat the Street : How a Friendship Pact Led to Success , followed in 2005 . <p> Hunt , an internist at the University Medical Center in Princeton , N.J. , came up with the idea for the new book . At first , he thought it would be about just him and his father . <p> But as he talked to Davis and Jenkins , " we realized that each of us had a similar but different story to tell . We had all grown up in a world where it seemed normal for men to abandon their children . " <p> Davis , an emergency-room doctor at Newark 's St. Michael 's Medical Center and two other hospitals , has a Christmas memory of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun on his mother . <p> " Mine was n't the kind of house where you could learn a lot about conflict resolution , " he says . <p> Jenkins , a dentist in Harlem and a professor at Columbia University College of Dental Medicine , grew up with little contact with his father , who lived in South Carolina . <p> " I 'm not sure I even knew his phone number , " he says . <p> Never a Father 's Day <p> In their predominantly poor and black Newark neighborhood , Hunt says , " Father 's Day was kind of like Rosh Hashana , " the Jewish New Year . " It seemed like a celebration for other people , a day that belonged to another culture . " <p> For their book , they enlisted the assistance of Margaret Bernstein , a reporter for the Cleveland Plain Dealer , who wrote an article about them they liked . <p> They set out not only to describe their childhoods but also to include their fathers ' stories and the sons ' attempts to get past their lingering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon himself to bridge the gap when a father ca n't , " is how Hunt puts it . <p> At the end of a workday last week , the three doctors all looked tired . They were meeting at the Newark campus of Rutgers University , where they have an office for their educational/medical foundation ( threedoctorsfoundation . org ) . But the more they talked about their book , the more energetic they became . <p> Not that is was easy to write . Jenkins recalls that his initial enthusiasm for the project dredged up " bitter feelings I had buried about my dad , feelings that eat at you and can eat you up . " For a while , he stopped work on the book , waiting to see chapters from Davis and Hunt . And he had to persuade his father to open up to Bernstein about his failures . Jenkins says , " My attitude was , ' At least he can do this for me . ' " <p> Davis ' father , Kenneth , 81 , became too ill to cooperate , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likable men , " Bernstein says . " Although they were absentee fathers , they were n't villains . " <p> By then , Hunt 's father , 52 , had rebuilt his life and talked " easily about his life and his flaws and his many regrets , " she says . " He knew how to wield his personal story effectively , like a cautionary tale . " <p> She found George Jenkins Sr. , 65 , " wanted badly to not repeat the pattern of fatherlessness he 'd had in his own life . Yet he did n't know how to create that bond during his brief visits with his son . I found it sad ; he had thought he could wait until George became a man to explain his side of the story , but it was too little too late . " <p> Newark : ' Worst of all ' <p> In 1975 , two years after the three doctors were born , Harper 's analyzed the 50 largest cities and declared that Newark " stands without serious challenge as worst of all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtown is in what officials call a " renaissance , " but Newark remains one of the most violent cities . Per capita , its murder rate is three times higher than New York 's . <p> In August , even jaded Newark was shocked by the murders of three black college students who , police said , were n't involved with a gang or drugs , just socializing at a playground . Witnesses said they were lined up and shot in the head in an apparent robbery . <p> " It 's so senseless , " Jenkins says . " They were n't bad kids . They were n't in the wrong place , doing the wrong thing . How can you protect them ? " <p> Hunt knows how quickly a life can change on the streets . At 16 , he got into a fight with a crackhead , and to show off to his friends , he " gently " stabbed him in the thigh with a knife . Hunt was charged with attempted murder , but the case was thrown out when the victim failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that being a rough guy was n't me . " <p> None of the three doctors is married or a father . All are dating , a subject they kid each other about . And all say that growing up with absentee fathers has made relationships with women harder . <p> " I never got a chance to see how to treat a lady every day , how to compromise , how to make a relationship work while raising a family , " Jenkins says . <p> Hunt says : " We did n't write a how-to book . We 're not telling anyone how to be a good father . But we wanted to help inspire and provoke people to think about their fathers or their sons and daughters . " <p> He hopes the book is " more universal than it appears on the cover : three young black guys , like this is only a problem for black families . " <p> Statistics do show fatherlessness is most common among poor black families , but Hunt says : " It can be problem even if the dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have statistics for that . " <p> At the funeral of Davis ' father in May , a relative showed Davis a copy of a resume Davis wrote when he was in medical school . <p> " My dad had made copies of it and sent it around to relatives down South to show what I had done . He was proud of me , but he could n't tell me directly . So part of me has to say , ' That 's OK . That 's who he was . ' " <p> For years , Jenkins did n't want anyone to think " that my father had something to do with the success I 've experienced . So I admit that I have put up a wall between us . " <p> Changing that remains a work in progress . His father 's chapter in the book ends hopefully : " I continue to invite George to family reunions so he can meet the folks down here who are so proud of him . Perhaps one of these days , he 'll make it . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's always at the wrong time . I 'm busy . I 've got a new job , and I 've got the foundation , and I 've got my own life . <p> " But it 's not malicious . I used to have a lot of resentment that he was n't there when I needed him , but at some point you 've got to let it go and say , ' What 's the point ? ' One of these years , I 'll make that reunion . " <p> # Find Documents with Similar Topics Below are concepts discussed in this document .
