<p> Harry Kranz used to consider himself the Alex Keaton of his West Side Chicago family , the only Republican in a house full of Democrats . His first time at the ballot box , he voted for Republican Dick Ogilvie for governor . <p> Today , Mr. Kranz is more Toby Ziegler of " West Wing " than the Keaton character portrayed by Michael J. Fox . He and his wife joke about being " Swedish socialists " when they discuss issues like high CEO salaries . His top concern is healthcare , and he 's a confirmed pacifist . <p> Still , Kranz - who used to run a small press and sponsor poetry readings , and now works with nonprofits to encourage charitable giving - does n't think all the change has been his . Back when he voted for Ogilvie , it was because he valued the idea of " treading lightly on individual freedoms . " It 's a notion he still agrees with , but which he thinks the Republican Party has drifted from . He abhors proselytizing and has " real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While there 's no archetypal Illinois voter , Kranz 's political journey is in some ways emblematic of the direction his state has gone . For decades , it was the classic swing state , voting for the winning presidential candidate 22 of 25 times in the 20th century . It went for Richard Nixon , Ronald Reagan , and Gerald Ford . From 1976 to 2002 , Democratic mayors in Chicago were balanced by GOP governors in Springfield . <p> But lately , the state has grown steadily more Democratic and is no longer considered in contention in presidential politics . Voters went for Al Gore over George Bush by a surprising 12-point margin in 2000 . Now , it 's just one more US state that has left the middle ground , the Midwest 's lone blue state in a Thomas Hart Benton landscape of purple and red . <p> A variety of factors is propelling the shift , everything from the Paul Simon effect - a reference to the popular late Democratic senator , elected by typically conservative downstate voters - to the lack of a Republican presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is from the GOP . <p> Suburbs and social issues <p> But perhaps most important , there 's the steady trend leftward in the suburbs . Indeed , for much of the past century , Illinois was the prototypical swing state because of the ring of humanity around Chicago . While the Democrats dominated in urban Chicago and the Republicans downstate , the suburbs ended up playing referee . They still do , but with rising numbers of Democrats in what were once Republican strongholds . <p> " The mix has stayed pretty much the same in the city and downstate , but in the suburbs it 's gone from being overwhelmingly Republican to being more competitive , " says Dick Simpson , a political scientist at University of Illinois-Chicago and a former Chicago alderman . <p> The city , too , has been changing . Long a manufacturing hub , the City of Big Shoulders now has twice as many professionals and technicians as production workers . Instead of being a big brother to Kansas City or Detroit , Chicago now has a service-sector cosmopolitanism that makes it the heartland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruy Teixeira , coauthor of " The Emerging Democratic Majority , " calls greater Chicago an " ideopolis " - a metropolitan hub with culture and diversity , where fewer people now pack meat and more practice law or perform in theaters . An economy oriented toward the production of ideas " tends to be fairly liberal , especially on social issues , " he adds . Now " those kind of voters really set the tone in a lot of the suburbs . " <p> Consider Monica Frigo , a young clerk who 's lived in suburban Park Ridge for 19 years . She remembers when her family was the only one in her neighborhood with a Clinton/Gore sign out front . Now , Democrats " are starting to come out of the woodwork , " she says , handing out Kerry/Edwards stickers at a town art fair . Plenty of residents are taking her stickers , including ones that say : " Republicans for Kerry . " <p> Many inner-ring suburbs , within Cook County , have become Democratic . But even in farther reaches such as DuPage County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US House since 1975 , Democrats are starting to have a presence . Two Republican house seats in the suburbs , Mr. Hyde 's and Phil Crane 's , are considered in contention this fall . <p> In Cook County - where those inner-ring suburbs are concentrated - the trend is even more extreme . In 1996 , the suburbs accounted for just 25 percent of the Cook County Democratic primary vote . By 2004 , it was 37 percent . The upshot : Al Gore enjoyed a stunning 40 percentage point spread over George W. Bush in Cook County . Four decades earlier , in another tightly fought race , John F. Kennedy 's margin over Richard Nixon there was 9 points . <p> Demographic change accounts for part of the shift , with newer arrivals including Hispanic immigrants , middle-class workers , and professionals from more liberal states . But many moderate Illinois voters have also become increasingly disenchanted with a Republican Party they see moving away from them on social issues . The result is an emerging Democratic bloc that is often fiscally conservative - antitax , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the national Republican Party has moved farther to the right , especially on issues like choice and guns ... They have lost many mainstream Republicans who are turned off by that kind of position , " says Michael Mezey , a political scientist at De Paul University in Chicago . <p> Luvie Myers is a case in point . She 's the mother of three teenagers , the wife of a consultant , who 's lived most of her life in Winnetka , an upscale suburb on Chicago 's North Shore . Throughout the 1980s , Ms. Myers was a Republican , voting twice for Reagan and for the first President Bush . " He was a class act . Patrician , sensible , educated , very experienced in government - a lot like someone who would live in Winnetka , " she says . <p> But she feels differently about Bush 's son , and abhors the current Republican Party . The turning point for her was the rise of the culture wars . " In the 1980s , those conservative people who spent all their time telling you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fringe , " she says . " Now you feel like the Republican platform has espoused these ideas that to me are institutionalized bigotry . I ca n't stand it . " <p> How people feel about abortion and gay marriage has become a sort of litmus test , she says , and she has a harder and harder time relating to those people who come down on the opposite side of the debate . <p> The small-business Republican <p> Die-hard conservatives certainly remain in Illinois . But many Republicans here are people like Chuck Dressel , whose family has owned an hardware store since 1923 . He 's says he 's Republican because " small business owners are Republicans . " But he 's antigun , for abortion rights and birth control , and would like to see healthcare extended to more people . He thought the invasion of Iraq " had to be done , " but he 's concerned about where the war is headed , and how many Americans have died . He 's still leaning toward supporting Bush in November - he and his wife usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't made up . <p> " I guess I 'm an economic Republican , " he says , standing in an aisle packed with nails and bolts . " I 'm not really excited about welfare for able-bodied people . " <p> Mr. Dressel lives in River Forest , but neighboring Oak Park , where he runs his hardware store , has become one of the most liberal of the Chicago suburbs , a place that early on moved away from its Eisenhower roots and now exemplifies one of the new political truisms , that people seek out places where their neighbors think the same way they do . <p> A haven that 's leafy , and liberal <p> A leafy oasis of top-notch schools and stately homes , but not far from the Loop , Oak Park has become a mecca for left-leaning professionals who want a suburban lifestyle but do n't want what they consider the homogeneity or closed-mindedness of the suburbs.It 's the birthplace of Ernest Hemingway and home to the largest concentration of Frank Lloyd Wright designs . <p> If Oak Park is more Democratic than most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift that 's been taking place in the surrounding area . Those residents are part of what pundits see as the growing base of the Democratic party : more white- than blue-collar , idealistic , highly educated professionals who listen to NPR and go to art-house films . <p> And they are active in politics . Signs for black Senate candidate Barack Obama began appearing on people 's lawns six months before the primary . <p> Conversations with residents here reveal a rich tapestry of concerns , even if most agree on the man they 'll vote for in November . For Kranz , healthcare is at the top of the list , because of how it has affected his own life . His wife , trained as a clinical psychologist , would like to have a private practice but instead designs employee-assistance programs for a company so the couple can get health benefits . <p> For Nancy Teclaw , an elderly woman who runs Oak Park 's senior center and is a member of the local Rotary Club , the top issue is abortion rights . Ms. Teclaw always used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an area where being a Republican " was almost like a nationality , " it was never really something she questioned . In 2000 , she voted for Bush . But as an ardent supporter of abortion rights and , more recently , gay rights , she 's slowly become disenchanted with the GOP . <p> Mary Wilkening and Dana Nasralla , two mothers out walking their kids around the neighborhood , have different reasons for their Democratic allegiance . Neither fits the liberal stereotype : They 're evangelical Christians , heavily involved in church . <p> " Faith is kind of central to our family life , " says Ms. Nasralla , carrying her 4-month-old baby Carter , named for the former president . " When it all comes down , it 's : ' What would Jesus ' answer to this be ? ' " <p> In politics , at least , these women have decided the answer to that question in a different way from many evangelicals . Ms. Wilkening ticks off the reasons she gives her 7-year-old son why she 'll vote for Kerry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Iraq , and I feel less secure in the world . I do n't like Bush 's economic policies , and I feel the world hates us . Then there 's the environment , and the deficit . " <p> Nasralla opposes abortion ( an issue where Wilkening waffles : " I guess I 'm more pro-life . But - keep your laws off my body " ) . It 's the same with gay marriage , though living in such a diverse neighborhood seems to have softened their views . <p> On other issues , they have little doubt . Their husbands used to be Republicans , but both have " converted , " they say . Nasralla 's spouse , who is Arab , had a sign up for Bush in 2000 , but now is disgusted with the president 's Middle East policies . <p> Over at George 's Family Restaurant and Pancake House , Arthur Murnan and Susan Perez are perhaps more stereotypical Oak Park residents . The friends were activists together back in the 1960s , marching together against the Vietnam War , and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic , but she 's not happy with the politics of her church , particularly the recent pronouncements by some bishops to deny communion to parishioners who support reproductive rights , or to those in Chicago who wore rainbow ribbons in favor of gay rights . <p> Both she and Mr. Murnan worry about the increased political divide in America , which they see within their own families . " It 's much more extreme than when I started to vote , " says Murnan . " When you look back to someone like Dwight Eisenhower - yeah , he ran on a Republican ticket , but he did n't seem like the Republicans today . The current president has made that dividing line real clear - you 're either with us or you 're against us . " <p> Illinois not indelibly blue <p> If the choice this year seems clear-cut to many in suburban Chicago , Illinois still is n't a Massachusetts shade of blue . Its residents are mostly of solid Midwestern stock , not so firmly entrenched in the Democratic camp that they could n't switch back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gubernatorial-vote history attests the readiness of many voters to support at least one brand of GOP leader . <p> " If at some point the Republican Party nationally is able to return to a more moderate brand of Republicanism , " says Professor Mezey , " then Illinois could come back into play . " <p> The state has its fair share of swing voters who jump across party lines based on a candidate 's character or specific issues . <p> Mike Schroeder , a mild-mannered carpenter with a blond moustache , lives on the border between suburbs and farmland in Huntley , where most of his neighbors are Republican . Self-described as apolitical , he grew up in a Republican immigrant family in Chicago . Mr. Schroeder was excited about Al Gore in 2000 . <p> " There was a guy that cared about the environment , was intelligent , was sensible , " he says . But he also voted for Ronald Reagan twice . As Schroeder munches on toasted nuts at the Park Ridge art fair , he reveals his secret : " I just go with whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Continental Divide series : The media and a split political landscape . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
