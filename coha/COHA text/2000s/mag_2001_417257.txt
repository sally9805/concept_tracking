Centered on the decorative arts and architecture , the American aesthetic movement , as it came to be called , evolved from the reform ideals put forth starting at mid-century by British design pioneers such as Christopher Dresser and Bruce James Talbert ( 1838-1881 ) , as well as by William Morris ( 18341896 ) and Edward William Godwin ( 1833-1886 ) and their associates . The Centennial Exhibition was the foremost catalyst of this AngloAmerican dialogue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all represented at the exhibition . The ideas of these English reformers significantly influenced the course of the design movement in America , but only Dresser visited the United States and explained how one went about preparing patterns for industry He was also the only one of the British group who made designs for American manufacturers.1 Moreover , he was singular in having received both a professional education in design for industrial production at the Government School of Design at Somerset House , London , and a doctorate in botany . Thus he was the only one who truly fulfilled the School of Designs motto of Uniting Science with Art , which lay behind the mottoes he himself used at various times during his career . Knowledge Is Power ; Truth , Beauty and Power and The Pursuit of Beauty ( see Pl . V ) . Photograph // Dresser was one of the first professionally trained designers for mass production , and may arguably have been the first industrial designer in Europe and the United States . He was without doubt one of the most radical and prolific designers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ botany , design , and interior decoration . His numerous lectures and books-The Art of Decorative Design ... ( London , 1862 ) , Principles of Decorative Design ( London , 1873 ) , and Studies in Design ( London , 1874-1876 ) - had become popular reading long before Morris and Godwin published their theories . By 1866 Dresser was acknowledged to be the true heir of his tutors Owen Jones ( 18091874 ) , Matthew Digby Wyatt ( 1820-1877 ) , and Gottfried Semper(1803-1879) , and he was recognized as having established " a school of decorative art , peculiarly English , pure in its character , and in its colouring perfect . " 2 Without acknowledging it , Morris , Godwin , and Talbert may have derived many of their ideas from Dresser . Both Morris and Dresser preached the gospel of art for the masses , but Morris was never able to match Dressers tremendous output for mass production , and his more exclusive arts and crafts products reached a comparatively small group of admirers . As Morris said of himself later in life , he was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 Where Dresser delighted in the machine and the discoveries of his own time , Morris looked to medieval arts and crafts and Godwin to the idea of art for art 's sake , an elitist view that lay at the core of the aesthetes ' ideology . No matter how different in their practical efforts , these designers frequently held principles that coincided in their pursuit of beauty , and it was largely due to their teachings that greater care was given to the household goods and interiors of ordinary houses both in Britain and in the United States . Dresser 's style was never dictated by dogmatic theories , but had a general affinity to the art of the early English Middle Ages and also suggested his admiration for Asian art . He was one of the leading figures in the introduction of Japanism , and he included a discussion of Japanese art in his lectures as early as 1861.4 In 1876 and 1877 Dresser was the first European designer to visit Japan after the opening of its borders in 1853 . He was involved in establishing a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company and the Alexandra Palace Company in 1873 , Dresser and Holme in 1879 , and the Art Furnishers Alliance in 1880 , all of which offered Japanese objects together with Dressers own creations-much the way his friends Arthur Lasenby Liberty ( 1843-1917 ) and Louis Comfort Tiffany ( 1848-1933 ) did in their stores some years later . Dresser was particularly influenced by the simplicity , honesty of construction , and subtlety of color in Japanese design and architecture . He denounced the use of veneer and the excessive ornament , carving , and upholstery so prevalent in Victorian design , which he felt concealed the true structure of an object . " An obvious and true structure is always pleasant , " s Dresser wrote , and he even made tenors , mortises , and rivets part of his ornamental vocabulary . Instead of the early Victorian polychromy Dresser advocated tints in secondary and tertiary colors . Primary colors could be used in decorative patterns on the wall or ceiling , but when viewed from a distance they should give the impression of a natural bloom , " similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainbow combine , " he wrote.6 He always expressed his preference for the Japanese style , and even went so far as to cover his walls with unadorned paper , as they did in Japan.7 It was Dressers doctrines on wallpapers , fabrics , and carpets that first made a mark in the United States . His impact on the design and use of wallpaper in the United States certainly rivaled that of Morris during the late 1870s and 1880s , and while Morris 's writings were probably more widely known to the American public than Dresser 's , Morris neither came to the United States nor designed for United States manufacturers , as Dresser did . Dresser exhibited designs for wallpapers , carpets , and ceramics at the Centennial Exhibition , and while in Philadelphia lectured at the newly opened Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art on " General Principles of Art , Decorative and Pictorial .

The design stencils were registered in the United States Patent Office ( see Fig. 1 ) , 9 but no published reference to them has yet come to light . However , scholars have identified in American collections a number of wallpapers from this period that could be Dressers designs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Pittsburgh decorating firm in 1877 and subsequently figured in an exhibition of three hundred English wallpapers organized by the John J. McGrath firm in Chicago in 1879.11 Constance Cary Harrison in 1881 noted that much of the improvement in American wallpapers originated from the fact that those of " Dresser and of Morris are familiar in our houses . " 12 The celebrated book Artistic Houses , Being a Series of Interior Views of a Number of the Most Beautiful and Celebrated Homes in the United States ( 1883 ) features a photograph of a Dresser wallpaper on the ceiling of the picture gallery in John T Martin 's house in Brooklyn , New York , and around this time John D. Rockefeller ( 18391937 ) decorated his house in New York City with the identical Dresser pattern of Lincrusta wallpaper made by Frank Walton and Company in England ( see Pls . II and IV ) . This pattern , in the style of a Japanese leather paper , was produced to match a dado paper of similar design that was among the first Lincrusta papers Walton launched in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Dresser Inv. " in the margin ( PI . XVII ) , as are many of the papers Dresser designed for Jeffrey and Company of London during the late 1870s . However , the example shown could as well be American . Besides specific ideas for patterns , Dresser 's papers at the Centennial Exhibition introduced the idea of dividing a wall horizontally with frieze , fill , and dado papers , a concept he had first recommended and illustrated in Principles of Decorative Design in 1873 . After his revolutionary wallpaper ensembles were exhibited in Philadelphia in 1876 , the idea was quickly taken up by American wallpaper manufacturers . In 1880 the New York City firm Warren , Fuller and Company was manufacturing similar wallpapers designed by Samuel Colman ( 18321920 ) and Louis Comfort Tiffany , 14 whom Dresser had befriended during his visit to Philadelphia in 1876 . Many of these are in the japanesque manner and bear a certain resemblance to Dressers designs .

A detail appears on the frontispiece . Metropolitan Museum of Art , New York City . // Although English " art patterns " and theories about them were not as wholeheartedly accepted in the carpet industry as they were in the wallpaper trade , the English did make their mark on American carpets . As was the case for wallpapers , the most influential English models for carpets came from Morris and Dresser . The two were more nearly in agreement about carpet design than about wallpapers . Morris felt that the angular geometry built into the large scale of web and woof dictated the use of geometric and conventional forms of the kind Dresser favored for all ornamentation . Some of Dressers carpet designs for John Crossley and Sons and for John Lewis and Company were shown at the Centennial Exhibition ( see Pl . VIII ) . In 1878 the Carpet Trade Review noted that " the influence of Morris and Dresser had gone everywhere short of the Bannock region , " and praised " Dresser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Company 15 Two years later the journal reported : " Some of our finest carpets are now got in fern patterns and leaflets . What is known at present in England as the Dresseresque design . " 16 Subsequently , Dresser 's series of articles entitled " The Decoration of Our Homes " of 1885 consolidated his popularity and presented his main thoughts on the subject to American decorators.17 Dresser 's theories about stained glass were brought across the Atlantic with the stained-glass artist Charles Booth , who immigrated from Liverpool to New York City , where he established a workshop at 166 Fifth Avenue in 1875 . In his Principles of Decorative Design Dresser dealt thoroughly with the schematic possibilities of windows , advocating the use of bold outlines of lead around flat areas of color.18 Even a motif from nature was to be flattened and show no trace of shading , foreshortening , or perspective . Booth adhered closely to Dressers advice . His work was dominated by two-dimensional designs and simplified ornamental forms ( see Fig. 2 ) , and the schemes he delineated in Modem Surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York magazine Art-Worker ( 1878 ) followed Dresser 's novel theories about conventionalized ornament .

The design has been attributed to the Philadelphia architect and designer Frank Furness . American scholars have frequently pointed out the similarity between the designs of Furness and Dresser and they have suggested the possibility that they met in Philadelphia in 1876.19 Furness 's buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenced by Talbert and Dresser , and about 1876 Furness developed foil-backed painted glass to chromatically enhance his designs and buildings .

Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library , Columbia University , New York City . // Another prominent American cabinetmaker often associated with Dresser is Herter Brothers of New York City particularly Christian Herter ( 1840-1883 ) who studied in England during the early 1870s , where he must have been introduced to Dresser or at least to his doctrines and designs.20 Herter was also a close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dresser when Dresser visited New York in 1876 and 1877 . About that time Herter Brothers developed its unique version of the Anglo-Japanese style in furniture , rectilinear in outline and constructed of ebonized wood . The decoration consists of contrasting light-toned lacquer or marquetry in stylized , often asymmetrical patterns , shallow carvings , and incised details ( see Pl . VII ) . The resemblance to Dressers furniture of this period is striking . Herter Brothers , like Tiffany and Dresser , imported Japanese objects to complement their furniture in this style . The New York City furniture and decorating company of Anthony Kimbel and Joseph Cabus ( w. together 1863-1882 ) also produced furniture in the 1870s that resembles some of Dressers early designs in the modern medieval style , featuring stylized figures or floral patterns . Kimbel and Cabus were certainly aware of Dressers designs , for one of their trade cards from the 1870s shows a medieval cabinet with Dressers striking sugar bowl inside . Kimbel and Cabus may have met Dresser at the Centennial Exhibition , where they displayed a drawing room suite in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early inspiration from the English design pioneers , and certainly from Dresser with regard to ornament , interior design , and furniture . Frank Furness , with whom Sullivan worked for a few months in 1873 , may have introduced him to Dresser , who clearly influenced Sullivan 's ornamental designs at the time ( see Pl . XI ) .22 Sullivan 's ornaments are more intensely personal than those of any other American architect associated with the aesthetic movement . They exemplify the dialogue between the mechanical and the organic with the use of prickly stylized plant forms-a theme also found in Dressers ornament ( see Pl . X ) . The wide interest in collecting and producing pottery and porcelain peaked around the time of the Centennial Exhibition in both England and the United States . The Philadelphia exhibition presented the most comprehensive view of Japanese porcelain and ceramics ever seen in the West , notably-and for the first time-the coarser-bodied Awata , Awaji , Banko , Raku , Tamba , and Takatori wares.23 During his tour in Japan , Dresser collected precisely this kind of ceramic ware with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production at Linthorpe Pottery in Hull , England . In Philadelphia , however , he showed the finer  --  bodied so-called cloisonne on porcelain that he had introduced at Minton 's in the early 1860s ( see Pl . XII ) and the unglazed or salt  --  glazed Watcombe terracotta ceramics that were produced from 1869 to 1883 ( see Pl . XIII ) and were clearly inspired by Japanese prototypes . Dressers Minton and Watcombe designs certainly inspired , respectively , the decorated ceramics produced by the Greenwood Pottery ( 1861-1933 ) , Ott and Brewer ( 1871-1892 ) , and the Eureka Pottery Company ( 1883-1887 ) , all in Trenton , New Jersey , and the unglazed terracotta vases of the Chelsea Keramic Art Works ( 1872-1889 ) in Chelsea , Massachusetts . Dresser received a bronze medal for his display of Linthorpe Pottery objects at the World 's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exhibition in New Orleans in 1884.24 George Ohr ( 1857-1918 ) of Biloxi , Mississippi , probably saw Dressers exhibit and subsequently produced related , eccentrically shaped vessels often solely decorated with glaze.25 Louis Comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing his own after about 1900 , and perhaps even more apparant are the similarities between Tiffany 's Favrile glass from the 1890s and Dressers " Clutha " glass produced by James Couper and Sons in Glasgow from the 1880s onwards ( see PI . XIV ) . After their meeting at the Centennial Exhibition Tiffany and Dresser formed a lifelong friendship . Tiffany commissionned Dresser to bring back a vast collection of objects from Japan , which Dresser delivered to Tiffany and Company on his way back to England in 1877.26 Several of these artifacts provided the main impetus for the japanesque creations of Tiffany and Company 's chief designer Edward C. Moore as well as for many of the designs of Louis Comfort Tiffany and his interior decorating firm , Associated Artists . The firm , which existed from 1879 to 1883 , was strongly influenced by Dressers interior designs , incorporating japanesque motifs in its wallpapers , painted friezes , tiles , embroidered hangings , and colored glass . The similarities are often striking , as for instance the frog designs in Moore 's mixed metal objects ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the " Owari " vase painted " with fantastic frog scenes " that Dresser brought back from Japan in 1877.27 The New York World provided a detailed description of the Japanese collection Dresser amassed for Tiffany and Company , and particularly praised the various metal objects display inlay techniques and peculiar mixtures of metals , such as shibuichi , shakudo , and mokume . Tiffany and Company launched a substantial production of similar creations in 1877 and 1878 , which were received as the most important innovation in Western metalworking at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1878 . Dresser himself praised these exhibits in an exuberant letter to Tiffany dated July 25 , 1878 : No silversmith that I know , has made the progress in art as applied to their industry in the last years , that you have indeed , the rapidity of your advancement has astonished many of my art friends as well as myself After such consideration , I can not help thinking that , judged by the exhibits in Paris-you occupy the proud position of being the first silversmiths of the world . 28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enamel objects , in particular a translucent enamel screen , one of four taken from the emperor 's palace and valued at four thousand dollars . It evidently provided Tiffany and his friend John La Farge ( 1835-1910 ) with inspiration for the stained-glass screens and windows in the Japanese style they created in the later 1870s .

Author 's photograph // The collection for Tiffany also contained " beautiful silk and satin bed quilts , richly embroidered in designs and representing tropical birds and bright hued flowers . " 29 These were certainly admired by Tiffany 's associate Candace Wheeler ( 1827-1923 ) who around this time began to specialize in Japanese style embroideries , which became highly popular in the United States . The collection was a highlight of the exhibition season in New York City in the spring of 1877 . The Japanese craze had by then reached its peak in New York , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand objects . The Philadelphia Evening Bulletin noted that the Tiffany collection " overshadows the collection of the Metropolitan , from the fact that its display is more brilliant and varied , and hence more interesting to the modern eye , " and that it was formed to give us an idea of " artistic designs which have been introduced into the manufacture of the articles in use in a Japanese household-in low life and in the home of the wealthy classes .

On Bigelow 's recommendation in 1882 Morse began collecting precisely the coarser kind of Japanese ceramics and teawares admired by Dresser , and like Dresser , these collectors embraced all types of Japanese art , and undertook similar research into the architecture , fine art , sculpture , ceramics , and religion of Japan . They have indeed been reckoned the first systematic collectors of Japanese art in the United States and Morse and Fenollosa 's collections later enriched the Museum of Fine Arts , Boston , where both were appointed curators on their return from a trip to Japan .

The New York Times summed up the great impact Dresser had made during his stay in the United States in 1876 and 1877 : One of the most perfect specimens of art intellect which England shipped to the U.S. for the exhibition at Philadelphia was , without doubt Dr. Christopher Dresser . He styles himself " art adviser " and is well known to American designers and art manufacturers by several publications .
