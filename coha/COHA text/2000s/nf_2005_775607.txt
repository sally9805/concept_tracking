CHAPTER 1 The Community Said He Was Crazy // In three key criteria  --  the factors that produce depression , the symptoms of // what psychiatrists call major depression , and the typical age of onset  --  the // case of Abraham Lincoln is perfect . It could be used in a psychiatry textbook // to illustrate a typical depression . Yet Lincoln 's case is perfect , too , in a very // different sense : it forces us to reckon with the limits of diagnostic categories // and raises fundamental questions about the nature of illness and health . // Though great resources in research and clinical science have // been devoted to depression in the past few decades , we can neither cure it // nor fully explain it.What we can do is describe its general characteristics . // The perverse benefit of so much suffering is that we know a great deal about // what the sufferers have in common . To start , the principal factors behind // depression are biological predisposition and environmental influences . Some // people are more susceptible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other mood disorders run in families , not only because of // what happens in those families , but because of the genetic material families // share . A person who has one parent or sibling with major depression is one // and a half to three times more likely than the general population to // experience it . // The standard way to investigate biological predisposition is simply // to list the cases of mental illness  --  or mental characteristics suggestive of // potential illness  --  in a family . With Lincoln , such a family history suggests // that he came by his depression , at least in part , by old-fashioned inheritance . // His parents , Thomas and Nancy Lincoln , came from Virginia families that // crossed the Appalachian Mountains into Kentucky in the late eighteenth // century . They married in 1806 and had three children : Sarah , born February // 10 , 1807 ; Abraham , born February 12 , 1809 ; and Thomas , born about 1811. // Though our information is imperfect , to say the least , both parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descriptions of // Nancy Lincoln have her as sad . For example , her cousin John Hanks said // her nature " was kindness , mildness , tenderness , sadness . " And Lincoln // himself described his mother as " intellectual , sensitive and somewhat sad . " // Tom Lincoln , a farmer and carpenter , was a social man with a talent for jokes // and stories , but he , too , had a somber streak . " He seemed to me , " said his // stepgrandson , " to border on the serious  --  reflective . " This seriousness could // tip into gloom . According to a neighbor in Kentucky , he " often got the ' blues , ' // and had some strange sort of spells , and wanted to be alone all he could // when he had them . " During these spells he would spend as much as half a // day alone in the fields or the woods . His behavior was strange enough to // make people wonder if Tom Lincoln was losing his mind . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Lincoln 's family comes from his paternal relations . His great-uncle once told // a court of law that he had " a deranged mind . " His uncle Mordecai Lincoln had // broad mood swings , which were probably intensified by his heavy drinking . // And Mordecai 's family was thick with mental disease . All three of his sons  --  // who bore a strong physical resemblance to their first cousin Abraham  --  were // considered melancholy men . One settler who knew both the future president // and his cousins spoke of the two " Lincoln characteristics " : " their moody // spells and great sense of humor . " One of these Lincoln cousins swung wildly // between melancholia and mania and at times had a tenuous grip on reality , // writing letters and notes that suggest madness . Another first cousin of // Lincoln 's had a daughter committed to the Illinois State Hospital for the // Insane . After a trial , a jury in Hancock County committed thirty-nine-year-old // Mary Jane Lincoln to the hospital , noting that " her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital , an attendant observed , " Her father was cousin to // Abraham Lincoln , and she has features much like his . " // What is striking about the case of Mary Jane Lincoln is that the // jury , charged with answering the question of whether insanity ran in her // family , concluded that " the disease is with her hereditary . " According to a // family historian who grew up in the late nineteenth century , the descendants // of Mordecai Lincoln " suffered from all the nervous disorders known . Some // were on the ragged edge . " One family member who had frequent spells of // intense mental trouble referred to his condition as " the Lincoln horrors . " // Three elements of Lincoln 's history  --  the deep , pervasive sadness // of his mother , the strange spells of his father , and the striking presence of // mental illness in the family of his uncle and cousins  --  suggest the likelihood // of a biological predisposition toward depression . " Predisposition " means an // increased risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // inheritance  --  in which one dominant gene or two recessive genes lead to an // illness or trait  --  genetic factors in psychiatric illnesses are additive and not // categorical . " The genes confer only susceptibility in many cases , " explains // the psychiatrist S. Nassir Ghaemi , in The Concepts of Psychiatry , " not the // illness . That is , they only increase the likelihood that fewer or less severe // environmental factors are required for the illness to develop , compared with // someone who has fewer disease-related genes . " // What tips a person from tendency to actuality ? For centuries , // philosophers and physicians emphasized climate and diet . Today 's experts // focus on harsh life events and conditions , especially in early childhood . // Lincoln 's early life certainly had its harsh elements . His only brother died in // infancy in Kentucky . In 1816 , Abraham 's eighth year , the family moved to // southern Indiana . Two years later , in the fall of 1818 , an infectious disease // swept through their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's aunt and uncle , Thomas and Elizabeth Sparrow , and his mother , // Nancy Lincoln . Eventually , the disease would be traced to a poisonous root , // eaten by cattle and then ingested by humans in milk or meat . But when // Abraham watched his mother become ill , the disease was a grim mystery // that went by various names , from " puking fever " to " river sickness " to " fall // poison . " Later , it became known as the " milk sick . " " No announcement // strikes the members of a western community with so much dread as the // report of a case , " said a newspaper of the time . A physician described the // course of the illness : " When the individual is about to be taken down , he feels // weary , trembles more or less under exertion , and often experiences pain , // numbness and slight cramps . " Nausea soon follows , then " a feeling of // depression and burning at the pit of the stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side to side . Before long , the patient becomes " deathly pale and // shrunk up , " listless and indifferent , and lies , between fits of retching , in // a " mild coma . " First the Sparrows  --  with whom the Lincolns were close  --  // took sick and died . Then Nancy Lincoln went to bed with the illness . Ill for // about a week , she died on October 5 , 1818 . She was about thirty-five years // old . Her son was nine . // In addition to the loss of his mother , aunt , and uncle , a year or so // later Abraham faced the long absence of his father , who returned to Kentucky // to court another bride . For two to six months , Tom Lincoln left his children // alone with their twenty-year-old cousin , Dennis Hanks . When he returned , // the children were dirty and poorly clothed . Lincoln later described himself at // this time as " sad , if not pitiful. " // The one constant in Abraham 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thin , strong woman who resembled her father in stature , with brown // hair and dark eyes . Like her brother , Sarah Lincoln had a sharp mind . She // stayed with the family until 1826 , when she married , set up house , and // quickly became pregnant . On January 28 , 1828 , she gave birth to a stillborn // child and shortly afterward died herself . " We went out and told Abe , " recalled // a neighbor . " I never will forget the scene . He sat down in the door of the // smoke house and buried his face in his hands . The tears slowly trickled from // between his bony fingers and his gaunt frame shook with sobs . " // In the emotional development of a child , pervasive tension can be just as // influential as loss . Lincoln 's relationship with his father  --  the only other // member of his nuclear family who survived  --  was so cool that observers // wondered whether there was any love between them . The relationship was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , Abraham showed a // strong interest in his own education . At first his father helped him along , // paying school fees and procuring books . " Abe read all the books he could lay // his hands on , " said his stepmother . " And when he came across a passage // that struck him he would write it down . . . then he would re-write it  --  look at // it  --  repeat it . " But at some point Tom Lincoln began to oppose the extent of // his son 's studies . Abraham sometimes neglected his farm work by reading . // Tom would beat him for this , and for other infractions. // To men who had been born and expected to die on farms , book // learning had limited value . A man ought to be able to read the Bible ( for his // moral life ) and legal documents ( for his work life ) . Writing could help , too , as // could basic arithmetic . Anything more was a luxury , and for working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had cleared land , raised // crops , and worked a trade . So when this boy slipped away from feeding // livestock and splitting logs to write poetry and read stories , people thought // him lazy . " Lincoln was lazy  --  a very lazy man , " remembered his cousin // Dennis Hanks . " He was always reading  --  scribbling  --  writing  --  ciphering  --  // writing poetry &amp;c. &amp;c. " // Later , Lincoln 's self-education would become the stuff of legend . // Many parents have cited Lincoln 's long walks to school and ferocious self- // discipline to their children . But Lincoln pursued his interests in defiance of // established norms . Far from being praised , he was consistently admonished . // He may well have paid an emotional toll . Many studies have linked adult // mental health to parental support in childhood . Lower levels of support // correlate with increased levels of depressive symptoms , among other health // problems , in adulthood . After Lincoln left home in his early twenties , his // contact with his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln 's childhood , we should keep // in mind some context . For example , in the early nineteenth century , one out // of four infants died before their first birthday . And about one fourth of all // children lost a mother or father before age fifteen . Of the eighteen American // presidents in the nineteenth century , nine lost their mother , father , or both // while they were children . None of Lincoln 's contemporaries , nor Lincoln // himself , mentioned the deaths of his siblings and mother as factors // contributing to his melancholy . The melancholy was unusual , but the deaths // were not . In the same vein , while we ought not to ignore Lincoln 's conflict // with his father and discount its possible emotional aftereffects , we risk // missing more than we gain if we look at it exclusively through the lens of // modern psychology . In fact , such a conflict between ambitious young men // and their fathers was not uncommon in the early nineteenth century , a time // of broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wounded child , but signs point to his // being sensitive . He spent a lot of time alone . He was serious about his // studies and reading , and uncommonly eager to explore imaginative realms , // which psychologists often observe in sensitive children . He also took up a // popular cause among sensitive people , the welfare of animals . Some boys // found it fun to set turtles on fire or throw them against trees . " Lincoln would // Chide us  --  tell us it was wrong  --  would write against it , " remembered one of // his neighbors . His stepsister remembered him once " contending that an ants // life was to it , as sweet as ours to us. " // At the same time , Lincoln was a winsome child . Others sought // him out , followed him in games , and applauded him when he mounted a // stump and performed for them , pretending to be a preacher or a statesman . // By the time he was a teenager , grown men would flock around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was well liked . // Lincoln was not depressed in his late teens and early twenties  --  at least not // so far as anyone could see . When he left his family , at age twenty-one , he // had no money or connections . His chief asset  --  perhaps his only real asset  --  // was his golden character . Settling as a stranger in New Salem , a small // village on a river bluff in central Illinois , he soon was among the best-liked // men around . A gang of rough boys developed a fierce attachment to him after // he made a stellar showing in a wrestling match , displaying not only physical // strength but a sense of fairness . Others were impressed with Lincoln 's wit // and intelligence , noticing , for example , how when he recited the poetry of // Robert Burns , he nailed the Scottish accent , the fierce emotion , and the // devilish humor . Though Lincoln looked like a yokel  --  tall and gangly , he had // thick , black , unruly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he // had good ideas and a good manner . " He became popular with all classes , " // said Jason Duncan , a physician in New Salem . // After less than a year in New Salem , Lincoln declared himself as // a candidate for the Illinois General Assembly . He was twenty-three years old . // He lost the race but got nearly every vote in his precinct , which , said another // candidate , was " mainly due to his personal popularity . " When he volunteered // for a state militia campaign against a band of Native Americans under Chief // Black Hawk , a part of the bloody Black Hawk War , his company elected // Lincoln captain . Nearly three decades later  --  as a veteran of Congress and // his party 's nominee for president of the United States  --  Lincoln wrote that // this was " a success which gave me more pleasure than any I have had since . " // In his first four years in New Salem , Lincoln struck his new friends // and neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln angry or // desponding , " said a fellow soldier in the Black Hawk War , " but always // cheerful . " Indeed , " the whole company , even amid trouble and suffering , // received Strength &amp; fortitude , by his bouancy and elasticity . " Once Lincoln // stopped at the house of a neighbor , Elizabeth Abell , after working in the // fields . He was scratched all over from briar thorns . Abell fussed over him , but // Lincoln laughed about it and said it was the poor man 's lot . " Certainly , " she // said years later , " he was the best natured man I ever got acquainted with . " // Asked by a biographer whether the Lincoln she knew was a " sad man , " Abell // answered , " I never considered him so . He was always social and lively and // had great aspirations . " Crucially , his liveliness and sociability served him well // in politics . Campaigning again for the state legislature in 1834 , he went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were working the harvest . A friend of // Lincoln 's , J. R. Herndon , introduced him . The men said that they could n't // vote for a man who did n't know how to do field work . " Boys , " Lincoln said , " if // that is all I am sure of your votes . " He picked up a scythe and went to // work . " I do nt think he Lost a vote in the Croud , " Herndon wrote . // Lincoln won the election easily . When a mentor in the legislature // recommended that he study law , he took the challenge . It would be a good // profession to accompany politics , in particular the politics of the Whig party , // which drew its strength from the growing number of urban and industrial // professionals . In the early nineteenth century , attorneys commanded a kind // of awe , embodying the stately Anglo-Saxon tradition of common law and // domestic order . Gaining " the secrets of that science , " explained the poet- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perpetual glow , for the // law , " more than all other human forces , directs the progress of events . " // It is a mark of Lincoln 's soaring ambition that , four years from the // fields , he sought to join such ranks , at a time when all but five percent of the // men in his area did manual work for a living . It was a sign of his pluck that he // did it virtually all on his own . While other young men learned the law at // universities  --  or , more commonly , under the tutelage of an established // attorney  --  Lincoln , as he noted in his memoir , " studied with nobody . " This // was hardly the only mark of his ambition . A lawyer named Lynn McNulty // Greene remembered Lincoln telling him that " all his folks seemed to have // good sense but none of them had become distinguished , and he believed it // was for him to become so . " This language suggests that Lincoln had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling . " Mr. Lincoln , " explained his friend // O. H. Browning , " believed that there was a predestined work for him in the // world . . . Even in his early days he had a strong conviction that he was born // for better things than then seemed likely or even possible . . . While I think he // was a man of very strong ambition , I think it had its origin in this sentiment , // that he was destined for something nobler than he was for the time engaged // in . " In his first published political speech , Lincoln wrote , " Every man is said to // have his peculiar ambition . Whether it be true or not , I can say for one that I // have no other so great as that of being truly esteemed of my fellow men , by // rendering myself worthy of their esteem . " // But there were cracks in Lincoln 's sunny disposition . " If the good // people in their wisdom shall see fit to keep me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same speech , " I have been too familiar with disappointments to be very // much chagrined . " At times , his faith in personal progress gave way and his // familiarity with disappointments shone through . Back from the militia // campaign , Lincoln and a partner opened their own store , buying the stock on // credit . When the store failed , Lincoln was in serious financial jeopardy . // Seeing him despondent , his new friends got him a crucial political // appointment , as New Salem 's postmaster . Later , he was made deputy // surveyor , too . These jobs , Lincoln noted , " procured bread , and kept soul and // body together . " Nevertheless , his debt soon caught up with him : a creditor // seized his surveying equipment  --  including his horse , his compass , and his // chain  --  and put it up for auction . An older man named James Short saw // Lincoln moping about and heard him say he might " let the whole thing go . " // Short tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment for $120 // ( about $2,500 in modern dollars ) and returned it to Lincoln . // These streaks of sadness and worry may have been minor // depressions . But it was n't until 1835 that serious concern emerged // about Lincoln 's mental health . That summer , remembered the schoolteacher // Mentor Graham , Lincoln " somewhat injured his health and Constitution . " The // first sign of trouble came with his intense study of law . He " read hard  --  day // and night  --  terribly hard , " remembered Isaac Cogdal , a stonemason . At // times , Lincoln seemed oblivious to his friends and surroundings . " He became // emaciated , " said Henry McHenry , a farmer in the area , " and his best friends // were afraid that he would craze himself  --  make himself derange. " // Around the same time , an epidemic of what doctors called " bilious fever "  --  // typhoid , probably  --  spread through the area . Doctors administered heroic // doses of mercury , quinine , and jalap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln helped tend to the sick , build coffins for the dead , and // assist in the burials  --  despite the fact that he was " suffering himself with the // chills and fever on alternate days . " He was probably affected mentally , too , // by the waves of death washing across his new home  --  reminiscent , perhaps , // of the " milk sick " that had devastated his family in his youth . // Among the severely afflicted families were Lincoln 's friends the // Rutledges . Originally from South Carolina , they had been among the first to // settle in New Salem , opening a tavern and boarding house , where Lincoln // stayed and took meals when he first arrived . He knew the family well and had // become friends with Anna Mayes Rutledge , a bright , pretty young woman // with flowing blond hair and large blue eyes . In August 1835 , Ann took sick . // As she lay in bed in her family 's cabin , Lincoln visited her often . " It was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neighbor named John // Jones . She died on August 25 . Around the time of her funeral , the weather // turned cold and wet . Lincoln said he could n't bear the idea of rain falling on // Ann 's grave  --  and this was the first sign people had that he was in the midst // of an emotional collapse . " As to the condition of Lincoln 's Mind after the // death of Miss R. , " Henry McHenry recalled , " after that Event he seemed quite // changed , he seemed Retired , &amp; loved Solitude , he seemed wrapped in // profound thought , indifferent , to transpiring Events , had but Little to say , but // would take his gun and wander off in the woods by him self , away from the // association of even those he most esteemed , this gloom seemed to deepen // for some time , so as to give anxiety to his friends in regard to his Mind . " // Indeed , the anxiety was widespread , both for Lincoln 's immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " told Me that he felt like // Committing Suicide often , " remembered Mentor Graham , and his neighbors // mobilized to keep him safe . One friend recalled , " Mr Lincolns friends . . . // were Compelled to keep watch and ward over Mr Lincoln , he being from the // sudden shock somewhat temporarily deranged . We watched during storms  --  // fogs  --  damp gloomy weather . . . for fear of an accident . " Another villager // said , " Lincoln was locked up by his friends . . . to prevent derangement or // suicide . " People wondered whether Lincoln had fallen off the deep end . " That // was the time the community said he was crazy , " remembered Elizabeth // Abell. // The fact that Lincoln broke down after Rutledge 's death , of course , // does n't necessarily mean that her death produced his breakdown . This is an // important point , because from the very earliest writings on Lincoln , his // relationship with Ann Rutledge has been controversial . Questions about // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been debated // fiercely , and still are . The myths and countermyths about this young woman // played a big role in the early historiography of Lincoln  --  and , amazingly , // played a large role in pushing Lincoln 's melancholy to the margins of history . // More on this in the Afterword , but for now the essential point is that leading // scholars have long said that what we think about Lincoln 's first breakdown // must hinge on what we think about his relationship with Ann Rutledge . If his // love for her is a myth , this thinking goes , then the breakdown must be a // myth , too . // In fact , in the eyes of the New Salem villagers , questions of a love // affair followed hard and irrefutable knowledge of an emotional collapse . As the // original accounts make clear , his breakdown was impossible to miss . Nearly // everyone in the community who gave testimony spoke of it , remembering its // contours even decades later . Lincoln , after all , had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families alike . Now , all of a sudden // he was openly moping and threatening to kill himself . Why ? people // asked.What accounted for the great change ? // It was in an attempt to answer this question that people turned to // his relationship with Rutledge . He had obviously been upset by her illness . // And after her funeral he had fallen off an emotional cliff . " The effect upon Mr // Lincoln 's mind was terrible , " said Ann 's brother , Robert Rutledge . " He // became plunged in despair , and many of his friends feared that reason would // desert her throne . His extraordinary emotions were regarded as strong // evidence of the existence of the tenderest relations between himself and the // deceased . " Notice the careful progression from fact ( Lincoln 's breakdown // after Ann 's death ) to inference ( they must have been tenderly involved ) . // James Short , who was the Rutledges ' neighbor , came to a similar // conclusion . " I did not know of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss R at the time , " Short said . " But after her death . . . he seemed // to be so much affected and grieved so hardly that I then supposed there must // have been something of the kind . " Because Lincoln " grieved so hardly " and // became " plunged in despair , " it seemed reasonable to his friends that there // must have been some proximate cause . // In fact , major depression , in people who are vulnerable to it , can // be set off by all manner of circumstances . What would appear to a non- // depressed person to be an ordinary or insignificant stimulus can through a // depressive 's eyes look rather profound . " It 's not the large things that send a // man to the madhouse , " Charles Bukowski has written . " No , it 's the // continuing series of small tragedies . . . a shoelace that snaps , with no time // left . " In this light , it is worth noting that , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rutledge 's death but the dismal weather // that followed . After the death , wrote John Hill , the son of Lincoln 's friend // Samuel Hill , " Lincoln bore up under it very well until some days afterwards a // heavy rain fell , which unnerved him and  --  ( the balance you know ) . " The // intonation here suggests an understanding among Lincoln 's friends that there // was something precarious about him , and that  --  like Bukowski 's shoelace  --  a // factor as ordinary as poor weather could send him reeling . As we will see , // cold temperatures would contribute to Lincoln 's second breakdown . Lincoln // himself would write that " exposure to bad weather " had proved by his // experience " to be verry severe on defective nerves . " // For whatever reason , or combination of reasons , in the late // summer of 1835 Lincoln 's depression was pushed out into the open . After // several weeks of worrisome behavior  --  talking about suicide , wandering alone // in the woods with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him into their // home . Bowling Green , a large , merry man who was the justice of the peace  --  // and who became , other villagers said , a kind of second father to Lincoln  --  and // his wife , Nancy , took care of Lincoln for one or two weeks . When he had // improved somewhat , they let him go , but he was , Mrs. Green said , " quite // melancholy for months . " // Lincoln 's behavior matches what the Diagnostic and Statistical // Manual of Mental Disorders , the handbook of mental health professionals , // labels a major depressive episode . Such an episode is characterized by // depressed mood and/or a marked decrease in pleasure for at least two // weeks . Other symptoms may include a change in appetite or weight , // excessive or insufficient sleep , agitation or lethargy , fatigue or loss of energy , // feelings of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt , indecisiveness or trouble // thinking or concentrating , and thoughts of death and/or suicide . To be // classified as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be // present , marking a definite change from usual functioning and with significant // distress or impaired functioning . If the symptoms follow the death of a loved // one by less than two months , it might be considered mourning unless , as in // Lincoln 's case , there is " suicidal ideation "  --  to ideate is to form an idea about // something  --  or other equally severe symptoms . " What helps make the case // for the diagnosis of depression , " says Kay Redfield Jamison , a professor of // psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University , " is Lincoln 's suicidal behavior and // the fact that it provoked a ' suicide watch . ' Today people are much more // sophisticated about suicide , but it 's pretty unusual to do that . It speaks to // the seriousness of what was happening with Lincoln . " // Lincoln 's breakdown also fits with the typical age for a first // episode of major depression . Most serious psychiatric illnesses emerge at a // particular time in life . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teenage years ; manic depression in the late teens to early // twenties . Unipolar depression , which Lincoln would struggle with his whole // life , typically breaks into the open in the mid- to late twenties . Lincoln was // twenty-six . // Many people wonder if Marfan syndrome contributed to Lincoln 's depression . // Marfan is an inherited genetic disorder that diminishes the strength of // connective tissue  --  the material that gives substance and support to bodily // structures , from tendons to heart valves . People with the syndrome tend to // be tall and thin , with elongated limbs out of proportion to their bodies . In other // words , they look like Lincoln , which is one reason some researchers suspect // he may have had the disorder . " Most of the Marfanologists think that it 's a // fifty-fifty chance that he did have it , " says Victor A. McKusick , a professor of // medical genetics at Johns Hopkins . " He might just by chance have been tall // and gangly . The physiognomy is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that basis alone . " Does Marfan syndrome cause depression ? At // least one study has suggested a higher presence of depression in people // with the syndrome . But McKusick says , " From the massive numbers of // patients I have seen , there is no characteristic personality of Marfan patients . // I would think that Lincoln 's depression was quite unrelated . " // Another common question about Lincoln is whether he had manic // depression , which is also known as bipolar disorder . This diagnosis is given // to people who alternate between episodes of depression and mania  --  long // periods of intensely heightened energy , often marked by euphoria , racing // thoughts , disinhibition , and risk-taking . No evidence exists of mania in // Lincoln . He did n't indicate trouble with swings in mood so much as with the // low moods of depression . Nor did his contemporaries describe anything that // sounds like mania . It is possible that he had what psychiatrists call // hypomania  --  below full-scale mania , but still characterized by heightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depressed // moods and hypomanic ones . But here , too , there is no clear evidence of // anything clinically significant . // On the other hand , it 's plain that Lincoln had major depressive // episodes . Even after he had brought himself under control , he still grappled // with desperate thoughts . Robert L. Wilson , who joined Lincoln as a candidate // for the state legislature in 1836 , found him amiable and fun-loving . But one // day Lincoln took Wilson aside and told him something surprising . As Wilson // recalled , Lincoln told him " that although he appeared to enjoy life rapturously , // Still he was the victim of terrible melancholly He Sought company , and // indulged in fun and hilarity without restraint , or Stint as to time Still when by // himself , he told me that he was so overcome with mental depression , that he // never dare carry a knife in his pocket . And as long as I was intimately // acquainted with him , previous to his commencement of the practice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " // Of those who 've had a single episode of major depression , more // than half will have a second . Lincoln 's second breakdown , in the winter of // 1840-1841 , bore a remarkable similarity to the first . It came after a long // period of intense work , when Lincoln pushed himself hard in pursuit of an // ambitious goal . Then , under profound personal stress  --  and in a stretch of // bleak weather  --  he collapsed . Once again , he spoke openly about his // misery , hopelessness , and thoughts of suicide . He was unable to work . His // friends feared that he might kill himself , and that if he lived , he might go // insane . Lincoln himself despaired that he would never recover . This will be // explored in depth in Chapter 3. // For now , it suffices to say that the breakdown was a second // episode of major depression . According to the criteria in the Diagnostic and // Statistical Manual , this qualifies Lincoln for the diagnosis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking , the illness is characterized // by two or more major depressive episodes , separated by at least a month . // More broadly , it suggests an underlying problem that can be expected to // surface in various ways throughout a person 's life . Consider : Someone with // two episodes of major depression has a seventy percent chance of // experiencing a third . And someone with three episodes has a ninety percent // chance of having a fourth . ( The phrase " clinical depression " can be applied to // any incident of major depression or to people who experience major // depressive disorder. ) // What the statistics suggest , the course of Lincoln 's life confirms : // by the time he was in his early thirties , he faced a lifetime of depression . // Still , the quality and character of his illness would change through the years . // The acute fits of his young manhood gave way to less histrionic , but more // pervasive , spells of deep gloom . Dramatic public avowals of his misery gave // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcend his suffering . // Yet the suffering did not go away . As we will see , in his middle years Lincoln // demonstrated signs of chronic depression . And even when he began to do // the work for which he is remembered  --  and took evident satisfaction in finding // a great cause to which to apply his considerable talent  --  he continued to // suffer . // Modern diagnoses can help initiate a discussion of Lincoln 's // troubles . With many physiological conditions , disease names are merely // pointers . They stand in for the " real thing , " which can be directly observed . // But with psychological phenomena , language does n't just name a reality ; it // creates a reality . This is crucial , given that the pain of depression is // compounded , for sufferers , by the fact that it is hidden and often suspected of // not being genuine . " In virtually any other serious sickness , " writes William // Styron in his memoir of depression , Darkness Visible , " a patient who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , possibly sedated and hooked // up to the tubes and wires of life support systems . . . His invalidism would be // necessary , unquestioned , and honorably attained . However , the sufferer of // depression has no such option . " By identifying Lincoln 's trouble directly and // clearly , we acknowledge it as a basic fact , just as he did . // Yet all too often medical diagnosis is used to end , rather than // begin , a conversation . To say , as recent scholars have , that Florence // Nightingale suffered from bipolar disorder or that the Salem witch trials were // driven by " epidemic hysteria , with conversion symptoms " is no substitute for // knowing how the individual figures , and the communities they lived in , // understood themselves . Such retrospective diagnoses often leave the // impression that modern psychiatric categories are infallible , when in fact they // are only one way to account for the complex reality of human trouble . // In their book The Perspectives of Psychiatry , Paul R. McHugh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person . The first // approach seeks to identify disease , or what the person has . The second // seeks to identify a person 's dimension , or who he or she is . The third // focuses on behavior , or what the patient does . Each of these approaches has // some value for a study of Lincoln 's life , but none so much as the " life story " // perspective , which seeks a holistic understanding of what patients want and // what they can become . // Diagnosis , we must remember , exists primarily to facilitate // treatment in a clinical setting . It is a snapshot at a moment in time . But here // we want to make sense of a whole life . As the writer and physician Oliver // Sacks has noted , " To restore the human subject at the centre  --  the suffering , // afflicted , fighting , human subject  --  we must deepen a case history to a // narrative or tale ; only then do we have a ' who ' as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patient , in relation to disease . " This distinction between case // history and narrative is right on point . The former tries to eliminate questions // with facts , whereas the latter draws on facts to articulate the essential // questions of a person 's life . // Can we say that Lincoln was " mentally ill " ? Without question , he // meets the U.S. surgeon general 's definition of mental illness , since he // experienced " alterations in thinking , mood , or behavior " that were associated // with " distress and/or impaired functioning . " Yet Lincoln also meets the // surgeon general 's criteria for mental health : " the successful performance of // mental function , resulting in productive activities , fulfilling relationships with // other people , and the ability to adapt to change and to cope with adversity . " // By this standard , few historical figures led such a healthy life . //
