HOW CAN I STORE MY BIKE ? I live in a high-rise apartment where 's it awkward at best-and downright damaging to the floors and furniture at worst-when I work on my bike . How can I maintain my bike without making a moss and store it without stubbing my toes ? I recommend the Park Home Mechanic Repair Stand ( $150 , www.parktool.com ) . Or if you 're on a budget , get a $15 workstand from Terry Bicycles ( **48;1220;TOOLONG ) . When I was a young , starving mechanic living in a oneroom studio apartment , I used to hang my bikes over my bed with two J-hooks . Later , when I married , my wife and I lived in a one-bedroom apartment , and I made a rack out of 2x4s and plywood that hung our bikes by the top tubes . The whole thing was narrow enough to sit in the hall . You 'll spend less than $10 for the supplies , and once you get the stuff home , it s hould only take 20-30 minutes to set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two Bike Storage System , $100 , www.nashbar.com Performance Bike Aloft Storage Rack , $90 , www.performancebike.com Gear Up Bicycle Storage Rack ( just like the one on Seinfeld ) , $120 , www.sportssolutions.net Performance Off The Wall II Storage Rack , $90 , www.performancebike.com For more ways to store your bike while protecting it from scratches , visit www.BICYCLING.com How should I prepare for wet , nasty rides ? What kind of preventative measures will make sure my bike gets through it alive ? I 've had lots of practice protecting bikes from the wet Pacific Northwest climate . I 'd say you should overhaul your bearings , wax the frame , put Bike-Aid ( $7 , 4 oz. , www.dri-slide.com ) on all the pivots and cables and use a clean lube like White Lightning RaceDay ( $9 , 4 oz. , www.whtlight.com ) or Pedro 's Ice Wax ( $5 , 4 oz. , www.pedros.com ) on your chain . And I hate to break this to you , but your bike is not alive . You are , however , and if you want to stay that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check your rims for wear , such as nicks and bowing from brake pad pressure . Nasty conditions will eat through the sidewall of even the best rim . If your rims are worn , think about buying ceramic rims . They 're impervious to sidewall wear and will last 5 to 10 years . Ceramic rims are better because of hardness . Scrape a plastic cup on the sidewalk , then do the same with a ceramic mug .
