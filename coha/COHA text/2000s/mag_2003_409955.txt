/Jan 2004 Pritam &; Eames , East Hampton , NY * Augusts- September 16 , 2003 Both Thomas Hucker and Jere Osgood make subtly mannered furniture with an intensely practical air . In this show of mostly new pieces , they use unexpected combinations of wood and unusual colors , but their work is so elegant that it seems as natural and matter-of-fact as a scrub oak on an East End roadside . Osgood is an acknowledged master and a senior figure in the world of studio furniture . He has work in major museums and was awarded a couple of National Endowment forthe Arts fellowships , elected a Fellow of the American Craft Council in 1993 and given the Furniture Society 's Award of Distinction in 2002 . Though he is a skilled draftsman with architectural training and in the early part of his career relied on mathematicalformulas to determine the curve of a bowl , he soon realized that it would be not only possible but preferable to rely on his own eye and intuition . Everythingthat followed bears the distinct stamp of his sensibility . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make furniture that echoes organic form , and to that end he reassembles wood so that it follows its growing pattern . What is clear to the most casual viewer is thatthere are no straight lines with Osgood ; he uses a variety of techniques in addition to clamping and coopering to create the gentlest bowingand swellingof surfaces . Uprights such as the base of a lectern suggest stylized tree trunks . His lectern , made of a smooth , blond curly maple , has a chest-high reading surface , a tilted plane that interrupts the long flow of the work 's four legs-symmetrical curves that suggest the trailing tentacles of an octopus . As they rise in compound curves from the floor , the legs are gathered into two bundles of laminated wood that burst upward through a cutout at the rearofthe lectern surface , as if remembering that they were once part of a maple tree . In another tall , narrow piece , Semainiere et Deux , in claro walnut , Osgood coopered the chest 's flanks ever so gently so that each of its nine stacked drawers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece is pictorially unified by a gentle ripple of wood grain . Small touches are what make Osgood Osgood : an abruptly upturned curve at the rear of the chest 's top shelf is like a breaking wave , and its legs however so slightly outward . The drawer bottoms are lined with sycamore , which reads as watered silk , and their sides with smooth white pine . Hucker studied with Osgood in the Program in Artisanry at Boston University in the late 19705 , and it must have been a mutually rewarding experience , for while Hucker clearly learned a few things from his teacher , it is instantly apparent that he , too , has an eye for natural form , and that he has developed a way to carry nature into his work . he is more inclined to make the grand gesture than Osgood , though we 're speaking in relative terms here . His large armoire of macassar ebony with silkglass insets is quite assertive , thanks to its grain , dramatically broken bars of alternating light and dark , and the wood 's natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of two sheets of pine in opposinggrains , one centered on the other . The effect is of a large pine shield with an inset medallion . The wood was taken from the beams of the old Academy of Music in Philadelphia . Mucker 's knockout work , however , is a bleached maple rocking chair with a pleasingoutline of simple curves that seems all innocence and even a bit sentimental untilyou examine its construction . How he managed to bringsuch a variety of compound curves into graceful play is his secret . There are references to sleighs and Shaker furniture and Art Nouveau , and though they may not have been intended , they suggest Hucker 's allusive range . Yet the chair has an air of inevitability about it , as if a dozen notable rockers from a dozen workshops had gotten together and agreed that this piece would speak for all of them . - ROBERT LONG Photograph LEFT TO RIGHT : JERE OSGOOD-Semainiere et Deux , 2003 , claro walnut , faux ivory , white oak , 60 by 15 inches ; OSGOOD-Settee , 2000 , curly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HUCKER-Low table , 2003 , salvaged pine , 16 by47 inches ; HUCKER-Kueihsing Cabinet , 2000 , macassar ebony , mahogany , silk glass , lighting , 72 by 36 inches ; HUCKER-Ladies Rocker , 2003 , maple , 35 by 21 inches .
