<p> I approach this annual task with a sense of foreboding . The 2002 Oscar race rests on shifting sands . There are scarcely even any absolute front-runners , unless it is Jennifer Connolly as best supporting actress . I am sure of one category , then another . Then I change my mind . <p> Best Picture <p> I began Oscar season convinced that " Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring " had a lock on this category . It is visionary , expensive , and has two sequels already in the can . If it is true ( and it is ) that one of the purposes of the Academy Awards is to improve future business , LOTR has more to gain than its competitors . It is also a pretty good picture  --  the kind of sweeping epic that reminds us of Hollywood 's glory days . <p> But then , no ... I began to doubt LOTR 's chances . The Academy voters skew older . They do n't much like action fantasies . True , many of them read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this picture at this moment ? No , there was another film they responded to more strongly : " A Beautiful Mind . " <p> This is the kind of film Oscar loves to honor , the story of a man who overcomes enormous odds to achieve great things . A schizophrenic who wins the Nobel Prize ? That sounds like a movie ! And one directed by Ron Howard , who combines being liked with being respected . And it stars Russell Crowe , a serious actor on a winning streak . <p> But then , no . ... The luster of " A Beautiful Mind " was tarnished in two ways . First , Crowe was unwise enough to get in a shoving match with the producer of the British Academy Awards , over the way his acceptance speech was edited . And we began to hear stories that the hero of " Mind , " John Forbes Nash , had been tidied up for the film version , had skeletons in his closet , and might even have spent some time in there with them . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My own feeling is that movies need to work as movies , not as fact sources , and that a schizophrenic can not be held to the same standard of behavior as a healthy person  --  especially when he goes without medication to keep his mind unclouded . But the film 's chances seemed to fade in the early days of March . <p> That leaves " Moulin Rouge , " surprise winner of the Producer 's Guild award , which has predicted the Oscar in nine of the last 12 years . This is a movie that has grown with familiarity . USA Today reported that its fans were watching it over and over on DVD , and indeed when I watched it in that form , I found new ways and reasons to enjoy it . It is venturesome , ambitious , wildly exuberant , and about show business . And it has no minuses . <p> Prediction : " Moulin Rouge . " <p> Best Actor <p> A two-man race , between Crowe and Denzel Washington ( " Training Day " ) . If I am right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all , and has not been a good boy who deserves another ) , the Oscar will go to Washington . <p> Conventional wisdom says the Academy seldom votes for evildoers , especially a cop as corrupt and vicious as Washington 's in this film . Voters sometimes seem to honor the achievments of the characters more than the skill of <p> the performers . How can they vote for a homicidal mad dog over a Nobel Prize-winner ? <p> Easy , I think . Denzel Washington 's image is consistently positive , he has played so many good and likable characters , he is such a nice man , that Academy voters will focus not on his vile cop , but on the stretch and risk it took for Denzel to play him . He 'll get a sympathy vote for having to be in the same movie with his character . <p> Prediction : Denzel Washington . <p> Best Actress <p> Here I think the best performance is clearly by Halle Berry in " Monster 's Ball , " but have enough voters seen it ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sissy Spacek for her searing work in " In the Bedroom , " and Nicole Kidman , whose " Moulin Rouge " was joined during the year with another admired performance , in " The Others . " <p> My first hunch was the voters will go for Spacek . They have admired ber for 30 years . They like comebacks . It is a very good film . But then ... my next hunch is that Nicole Kidman and Sissy Spacek will split the Very Good Film vote , and that Berry , whose performance really is in a league of its own , will take the prize . Her win in the Screen Actors ' Guild awards last Sunday may be a harbinger ( on the other hand , Crowe also won ) . <p> Prediction : Halle Berry . <p> Best Supporting Actor <p> A tricky category with no front-runner . I proceed with a process of elimination : Jon Voight would be the favorite if audiences had liked " Ali " more , but his fine performance is clouded by that film 's failure . Ben Kingsley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the group , but has the Academy seen it ? ( True , enough actors saw it to nominate it . ) Jim Broadbent in " Iris " is playing a soft-edged character in a squishy movie . Ethan Hawke is superb in his showdown with Washington in " Training Day , " and indeed has more screen time , but he has languished in indie films , tested the limits of his art , and in general not behaved like a star in training . <p> Sir Ian McKellan , on the other hand , is enormously admired , is in LOTR , which the voters will want to reward , is respected for his fearless militancy for gay causes , has been knighted ( the voters love titles ) , and is very good . <p> Prediction : Ian McKellan . <p> Best Supporting Actress <p> Jennifer Connelly . She 's in a film they like and admire , and has paid her dues by consistently side-stepping the sexpot roles she was born to play and choosing instead to work in serious and worthy films ( " Requiem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Pollock " ) . That she is really in a leading role only enhances the impression she has made on voters . <p> If there is an upset , it will be by Dame Maggie Smith or Helen Mirren , because the Academy loves them , Smith has one of those titles , and the voters have always meant to get around to one of those Iris Murdoch novels . <p> Prediction : Jennifer Connelly <p> Best Director <p> Ron Howard . The Academy has long meant to get around to honoring this favorite son , and here is the perfect chance , since , after not voting for " A Beautiful Mind " because of the disinformation campaign , they will want to vote for it anyway . <p> Possible dark horse : Robert Altman , who on Oscar night will be the best filmmaker in the house , nominated or not . But he 's an outsider , a maverick , and worst of all , a truly great director . Voters will wonder , if they honor him , who 'll be next ? Martin Scorsese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Film <p> " Shrek " will win . In fact , if this new animated category had n't been introduced this year , it had an even-money chance of being nominated as best film . It was that admired and liked . <p> Prediction : " Shrek . " <p> Best Foreign Film <p> " Amelie , " hands down . Wildly popular , even beloved  --  although , even liking it as I did , I could n't go that far ( it was good , not great ) . <p> Possible upsets : " No Man 's Land , " the darkly comic parable about the war in the Balkans , with its soldier trapped atop a live land mine between the lines . Or " Lagaan , " from India , the first Bollywood film nominated . It 's a box office hit , but will enough Academy members have sat through its 3.5 hours of song , dance , action , romance , melodrama , intrigue , history , politics and cricket ? Answer : No . <p> Prediction : " Amelie . " <p> Best Original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most directly responsible for the success of the film , is " Memento , " by Christopher Nolan . But I suspect the Oscar will go to Julian Fellowes ' slinky , witty work for " Gosford Park , " both because it does such a good job of juggling all the characters and story lines , and because at some point the voters will feel shame , actual shame , if they do not vote for the Robert Altman picture . <p> Prediction : " Gosford Park . " <p> Best Screenplay Adaptation <p> Akiva Goldsman 's screenplay for " A Beautiful Mind " will win , despite the fact that its failure to air all the dirty laundry about John Forbes Nash Jr . will be the precise reason the voters did not choose it for best picture . This will be because many voters will sneakily continue to think it is the best picture even while not voting for it in the top category . <p> Best Documentary <p> Again this year the Documentary voters have carefully avoided any film that had box office success , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the insider story " Startup.com , " or " Endurance , " the story of Scott 's Antarctic expedition ( it was disqualified on an inane technicality ) . <p> The winner will be " Promises , " by Justine Shapiro and B.Z. Goldberg , and boy , do we need to see this film now . Shot between 1995 and 2000 , when the borders more or less slammed shut between ordinary Israelis and Palestinians , it is about seven children , Jewish and Arab , and how they see each other in the world they are growing up in . They show great promise of being able to live together peacefully and become friends . Too bad about the adults running their worlds . <p> Prediction : " Promises " <p> Best Song : Randy Newman for " If I Did n't Have You , " from " Monsters , Inc . " <p> Cinematography : Andrew Lesnie , " Lord of the Rings " <p> Art Direction : Catherine Martin and Brigitte Broch , " Moulin Rouge : <p> Costume Design : Catherine Martin and Angus Strathie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ du n no , but maybe Dody Dorn for " Memento , " because when the voters get to this category they wo n't be able to stop thinking about the film 's backward crazy-quilt . Conventional wisdom : " Moulin Rouge , " because many voters in this category vote for the picture with the most cuts . <p> Makeup : Peter Owen and Richard Taylor " Lord of the Ring . " No contest . <p> Original Musical Score : John Williams , " Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone . " More for Williams than for the movie . <p> Sound : Andy Nelson , Anna Behlmer , Roger Savage and Guntis Sics , for " Moulin Rouge . " <p> Sound editing : Gary Rydstrom and Michael Silvers , " Pearl Harbor . " Because it looks like it was a harder job than the only other nominee , " Monster 's Inc . " Many members have no idea what they 're really voting for here . <p> Visual Effects : Jim Rygiel , Randall William Cook , Richard Taylor and Mark Stetson , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.I. : Artificial Intelligence .
