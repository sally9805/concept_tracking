SEVEN MEDICALLY PROVEN , DRUGLESS WAYS TO THWART THIS LEADING KILLER <p> As his yoga teacher at Iyengar Yoga Institute of Los Angeles raises herself up lithely on all fours , demonstrating the backstretching " down dog " pose , David Shapiro , PhD , follows along . At 78 , Dr. Shapiro , professor emeritus in the UCLA department of psychiatry &; biobehavioral sciences and an early pioneer in studies linking stress reduction to lower blood pressure , is fit , not to mention as placid as a Zen garden . So it catches me off guard when he reveals that he , like so many Americans , takes medication for high blood pressure . But thanks to regular exercise , a healthy diet , and stress-reducing pursuits such as yoga , he says , he 's been able to cut back on his medication significantly . <p> " I 'm hoping to cut back altogether , " says Dr. Shapiro , whose research has shown , among other things , that people with high blood pressure who make healthy lifestyle changes and manage their stress can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if not give them up entirely . Not surprisingly , he recommends these changes for everyone , even those who have n't been diagnosed with high blood pressure . With good reason . Last year , a report from the famed Framingham Heart Study warned that middle-aged and older Americans face a 90% chance of developing high blood pressure sometime in their lives . No small thing , since high blood pressure , while it causes no symptoms , boosts the risks of leading killers such as heart attack and stroke , as well as aneurysms , cognitive decline , and kidney failure . <p> Sitting in the back of the class , grimacing through yoga moves that no one but I seem to be having trouble with , I wonder if my odds of developing high blood pressure are even higher than average . I 'm fit and fairly calm myself , but my father , who had untreated high blood pressure , or " hypertension , " died of a stroke at 57 . My mother has high blood pressure too . Among other things , heredity influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You at Risk ? " on p. 150 . ) <p> As I tally up my risk factors , the story I 'm researching takes a personal turn . I vow to take the advice that experts such as Dr. Shapiro offer for controlling blood pressure : maintaining a healthy weight , exercising , eating right , and managing stress . " It takes all of these to fight the risk of high blood pressure , " says Prevention advisor Redford B. Williams , MD , professor of psychiatry and medicine at Duke University Medical Center . I may even try to get good at yoga . <p> If you have normal blood pressure , following these steps can help lower those 90% odds that your numbers will rise . If you already have high blood pressure , they 'll help you control it , possibly with a lower dose of medication , or none at all . Here 's your to-do list . 1 . Carry Less Excess <p> " When we 're talking about preventing high blood pressure , by far the most important lifestyle factor to consider is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of preventive medicine and epidemiology at Boston University School of Medicine . <p> Why excess weight translates to excess risk of high blood pressure is still a bit of a mystery , Dr. Ellison says . Among other things , obesity is associated with abnormalities in glucose and calcium metabolism and with certain hormonal changes that may be linked to high blood pressure , he notes . <p> " Almost everybody , if they lose a few pounds , is going to bring their blood pressure down , " he says . In some cases , very few pounds will do the trick . In one study , people who lost an average of just 7.7 lb and kept it off were half as likely to have high blood pressure as those who had n't lost weight . <p> The best way to lose weight ? Exercise more , and eat less . For more on both tactics , read on . 2 . Sweat It <p> Exercise helps lower blood pressure in a number of ways . It helps you shed excess pounds and manage stress . Regular aerobic exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiently . That , in turn , lowers your resting heart rate , which is helpful because a slower heart rate translates into lower blood pressure . Regular aerobic workouts also help make your blood vessels more flexible , so they give more when your heart pumps blood , and that also translates into lower pressure . <p> Prevention recommends 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity ( such as walking , jogging , or cycling ) at least 5 days a week . <p> " Moderate-intensity exercise appears to lower blood pressure as much as vigorous exercise , " says Deborah Young , PhD , associate professor in the department of kinesiology at the University of Maryland . 3 . Do the DASH Diet <p> Incorporating little fat , cholesterol , red meat , or sweets , but lots of fruits , vegetables , whole grains , and low-fat or fat-free dairy products , this diet takes its name from the comprehensive " Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension " study . The study followed more than 450 adults , about one-third of whom had high blood pressure , as they ate one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet that was higher in fruits and vegetables , and the DASH diet . While both the plan rich in fruits and vegetables and the DASH diet cut blood pressure , the DASH diet had the greatest effect , and after just 2 weeks . <p> Why does DASH work ? " While the diet is rich in vitamins and minerals that have been linked to lower blood pressure , it 's not these nutrients alone but the whole dietary package that works , " explains Eva Obarzanek , PhD , a research nutritionist at the National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute and a project officer for the DASH study . <p> Previous studies testing the blood pressure-lowering effects of supplements containing some individual nutrients were inconclusive . " It is possible that some nutrients have small effects individually , but when you get them all together in this diet , you see a significant effect on blood pressure , " she says . <p> Though the DASH diet was n't designed to promote weight loss , you can easily modify it so you 'll trim down by cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For details , see " The Diet That Lowers Blood Pressure , " below . 4 . Shake Off Sodium <p> To get even better results , follow the DASH diet and cut back on sodium , Dr. Obarzanek suggests . A follow-up to the DASH study , called " DASH-Sodium , " found that doing both lowered blood pressure more than following the diet alone . In the study , even people with normal blood pressure lowered their blood pressure when they cut back on sodium . <p> Certain groups of people  --  the elderly , African-Americans , and those with a family history of high blood pressure  --  are more likely than others to have blood pressure that 's particularly salt ( or sodium ) sensitive . But since there 's no way to tell whether any one individual is sodium sensitive , everyone should lower his sodium intake , says Dr. Obarzanek . How far ? To 1,500 mg daily , about half the average American intake , she says . ( Half a teaspoon of salt contains about 1,200 mg of sodium . ) <p> Cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which contributes just 15% of the sodium in the typical American diet . In addition to seasoning the foods you cook with spices , herbs , lemon , and salt-free seasoning blends , watch for sodium in processed foods , Dr. Obarzanek warns . Most of the sodium in your diet comes from processed foods , she says . 5 . Flag Yourself at One or Two Drinks <p> According to a recent analysis of 15 studies , the less you drink , the lower your blood pressure will drop  --  to a point . A study of women at Boston 's Brigham and Women 's Hospital , for example , found that light drinking  --  defined as one-quarter to one-half a drink per day for a woman  --  may actually reduce blood pressure more than no drinks per day . One " drink " is 12 oz of beer , 5 oz of wine , or 1.5 oz of spirits . <p> Other studies have also found that moderate drinking  --  up to one drink a day for a woman , two for a man-can lower risks of heart disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Dr. Obarzanek . " But moderate alcohol is protective of the heart . If you are going to drink , drink moderately . " 6 . Stay Out of Caf Nervosa <p> Scientists have long debated the effects of caffeine on blood pressure . Some studies have shown no effect , but a recent study at the Duke University Medical Center found that caffeine consumption of 500 mg-roughly three 8-oz cups of coffee-increased blood pressure by 4 mm/Hg , and that effect lasted until bedtime . For reference , 8 oz of drip coffee contains 100 to 125 mg ; the same amount of tea , 50 mg ; an equal quantity of cola , about 40 mg . <p> Caffeine can raise blood pressure by tightening blood vessels and by magnifying the effects of stress , says Jim Lane , PhD , associate research professor at Duke and the lead author of the study . " When you 're under stress , your heart starts pumping a lot more blood , boosting blood pressure , " he says . " And caffeine exaggerates that effect . " Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decaf versions . 7 . Learn to Chill <p> Meditation and other relaxation techniques such as yoga and tai chi can help lower blood pressure significantly , says Richard Liebowitz , MD , medical director of the Duke Center for Integrative Medicine . In a study of 62 sedentary seniors , in fact , those who started doing tai chi saw their blood pressure drop nearly as much as those who began a moderate-intensity aerobic exercise program . <p> Relaxation techniques trigger what Herbert Benson , MD , of Harvard Medical School , has dubbed the " relaxation response , " a calming of the nervous system that can lower blood pressure and slow breathing rate . <p> For a quick , at-home course in meditation , see " The 5-Minute Meditation " at www.prevention.com/links . While you can learn yoga and tai chi from videos , says Dr. Shapiro , many people find it easier to learn from an instructor and regular classes .

What Is High Blood Pressure ? <p> Your blood pressure readings  --  always two numbers , one over the other  --  gauge the force your circulating blood exerts against the walls of your blood vessels . Systolic pressure , the top number in a reading , indicates the pressure as your heart beats or contracts . The bottom number , your diastolic reading , indicates the pressure between contractions . You have high blood pressure when you have a systolic blood pressure of 130 millimeters of mercury ( mm/Hg ) or higher and a diastolic blood pressure of 85 mm/Hg or higher , or 130/85 . But most experts now agree that your optimal pressure is 120/80 or lower , as low as you can go without fainting when you stand up . <p> Good news , no matter your readings : Just a tiny drop in blood pressure , 2 mm/Hg , could reduce strokes by 14% and heart disease by 6% , potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> An estimated one in four American adults has high blood pressure . That 's more of us than have high cholesterol . Why so many ? In some cases , medical problems , such as kidney disease or narrowing of the arteries , are the culprit .
