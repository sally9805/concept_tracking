<p> Ralph Reed has crow 's feet . Tanned skin crinkles at the edge of each blue eye . <p> For most men , this would be an unremarkable sign of years piling up . <p> For Reed , it 's evidence that words like " boyish " and " cherubic "  --  which have defined him since he was a 20-something commander of the religious-conservative assault on Washington  --  are wearing thin . <p> The former leader of the Christian Coalition hits 40 and middle-age next month , and is eager to move beyond his reputation as the wunderkind of faith-based politics . <p> His election last week as chairman of the Georgia Republican Party , the most underperforming arm of the GOP in the South , may be just the ticket for that trip  --  if Democrats let him check his baggage . <p> " I know people know me mostly from my prior job , " Reed said . " But my political involvement dates back to the mid- ' 70s . I was working at the ( Republican National Committee ) when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican Party my entire adult life . " <p> But Democrats are unlikely to pass up the chance to use Reed to glue Republicans to the uncompromising positions of the religious right , abortion among them . <p> And truth be told , many Republicans do n't want Reed to move too far past his Christian Coalition days . <p> While Reed prefers to emphasize the strong connections to George W. Bush he 's built over the last four years , the rank-and-file who elected him want the same grass-roots organizer , accomplished TV spokesman and fund-raiser who helped put Congress in Republican hands in 1994 . <p> Other , more subtle reasoning is also at work . As U.S. Rep. Charlie Norwood ( R-Ga. ) pointed out , Reed has a characteristic unusually appealing to Republicans in South Georgia : He 's not from Buckhead . <p> Consulting , public relations <p> Since 1997 , when he left the Coalition , Reed has operated Century Strategies , located in the office building across from Gwinnett Place Ford in Duluth . <p> The business started out as a consulting firm offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His first election cycle in 1998 was less than successful , and included the disastrous campaign of Republican Mitch Skandalakis for lieutenant governor . <p> By 2000 , Reed had winnowed his political clients down to one . That client now lives at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave . <p> " If George W. Bush and his team want me to be a part of his re-election  --  and I hope they do  --  I will . But other than that , I do n't plan on doing ( political consulting ) in the future , " he said . <p> The firm now concentrates on public relations work for Fortune 500 companies . Reed generally spends at least one day a week in Washington . During off hours , he 's the typical suburban father of four , spending most of his free hours at baseball games and swim meets . He prefers swim meets , where he can prowl the sidelines with a cellphone . <p> Reed noted the vast difference between selling a Christian Coalition and selling a particular candidate . " One is an issues agenda that transcends candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are always there , " Reed said . " You 're more of an issues entrepreneur . " <p> As state GOP chairman , it will be Reed 's job to generate candidates , allocate resources , and serve as the party 's voice . It puts Reed back in the business of being an issues entrepreneur . " The skills required to be a state party chairman are much more similar to being head of the Christian Coalition , " said Whit Ayres , a Republican pollster based in Roswell . <p> Georgia Democrats have been eager but careful in their criticisms of their new adversary . David Worley , chairman of the state Democratic party , emphasizes the " divisive racial tactics " of Reed 's 1998 clients , including Skandalakis . Reed has disavowed those actions . <p> Worley also questions the logic that says Reed 's fund-raising talents will finance high-octane TV campaigns for Republicans . <p> " Do you think the president of Coca-Cola or the Southern Co. or AFLAC is going to be interested in associating with a party that 's agitating to change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But other than linking Reed to the " far right , " Democrats have withheld any attacks on Reed for positions he advocated as the head of the Christian Coalition . <p> In fact , Reed may be a harder ideological target to hit than Democrats suspect , say those who study the role of religion in American politics . <p> " He 's always been more of a Newt Gingrich guy , rather than an ideologue , " said Mark Silk , director of the Center for the Study of Religion in Public Life in Hartford , Conn . " He 's prepared to make compromises . He 's interested in political power . " <p> Silk recalled a 1996 evening with a downcast Reed shortly after President Clinton trounced Bob Dole , the candidate backed by the Christian Coalition . They were part of a party dining at the Hay-Adams Hotel in Washington . <p> " People think I 've got power , but I do n't have any power , " Silk quoted Reed as saying . Then Reed pointed out a window to a lighted office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national security adviser . " Now , Sandy Berger , he has power , " Reed said . <p> Found God in a bar <p> Reed 's upbringing straddled Florida and Georgia . Much of his childhood was spent in Miami , but he moved to Toccoa as a teenager . His first campaign was for president of his high school class . He won . <p> Reed was an active participant in collegiate politics at the University of Georgia , on the Republican side . ( A brief career as an unpaid columnist ended when editors of the campus newspaper decided a Reed tirade against the movie " Ghandi " too closely resembled an article in " Commentary " magazine . Young Reed vociferously denied any implication of plagiarism . ) <p> At age 22 , Reed found God during a stint in Washington with the RNC , specifically on a Saturday night in Bullfeathers , a restaurant-bar popular with GOP politicos . The next morning found him in the pew of a church picked out from the Yellow Pages . <p> When not politicking , Reed resumed his studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on evangelical colleges in the 19th-century South , including Emory , and their often unsuccessful struggles to hold onto their religious purpose . <p> " It was all about this evolution and this path from social and cultural marginalization . . . to being at the center of their society  --  politically culturally , economically , financially , " Reed said . Not unlike the path the author seeks . <p> The man in charge of Reed 's doctoral studies , historian Dan Carter , found nothing wanting in his student 's research . " His chapters were always on time and well-written , " said Carter , now at the University of South Carolina . <p> The two are friendly , but on opposite sides of a philosophical point . Reed sees the Christian Coalition and the religious conservative movement as the legitimate heir to the " social Gospel " movement that enveloped the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr . in the 1960s . Carter sees the Coalition 's roots in the blue-collar rhetoric of George Wallace . <p> The professor also thinks religious conservatism has changed since Reed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized movement than a wing of the Republican party . There 's no institutional structure that can pretend to be separate . " <p> About TV and money <p> Ralph Reed built the Christian Coalition from the shambles of the Pat Robertson campaign of 1988 . He was 28 . <p> Heretofore , the religious conservative movement was about television and fund-raising , best personified by the Rev. Jerry Falwell and his Moral Majority . <p> With Robertson 's blessing and encouragement , Reed broadened the agenda to include taxes and education policy . He tried to blunt the movement 's white , Protestant image by reaching out to blacks and Catholics . And he encountered resistance among evangelicals when he put his group 's clout behind candidates  --  like Dole  --  whose positions did n't entirely square with the established agenda . <p> But Reed 's greatest success was the precinct-by-precinct organization that made the Christian Coalition a dominant force in most state GOP organizations . During the early ' 90s , Reed was famous for " stealth " supporters who crowded into precinct meetings or registered their candidacies for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A decade later , during caucuses this February  --  the first step in the chairmanship campaign  --  Republicans got a reminder of what Reed is about . In many counties , strangers showed up who had never participated in Republican politics before , overwhelming party stalwarts . <p> " Grass-roots organization is ideologically neutral , " Reed said . It 's also worth 5 points on Election Day , he estimated  --  noting that most of Georgia 's recent contests have turned on smaller margins . <p> With the chairmanship , Reed inherits the only Republican party in the South that has n't produced a governor . While the congressional delegation is overwhelmingly Republican , the state Legislature remains under stubborn Democratic control . <p> The party often fractures along both regional and ideological lines . " Ralph does n't exactly come from the Buckhead crowd , and that kind of appeals to us , " said Norwood , the Augusta congressman . " He goes over just as well in Valdosta as he does in Dalton . " <p> Reed sees organization as the first step to a GOP revival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply run as anti-Roy Barnes or Max Cleland , " he said . <p> The third key , he said , is a higher quality candidate . " They 're out there . There are 1.7 million people who have moved to this state in the last decade . They have no loyalty or allegiance to this Democratic oligarchy at all . " <p> While Reed can open most doors in Washington , his experience in Georgia politics is still limited . His first test comes this summer , when the Legislature convenes in a special session to redraw political boundaries for congressional and legislative seats . <p> It 's a process that hangs on agreements and alliances usually reached behind closed doors . <p> But Reed says he 'll demand that Barnes and other Democratic leaders produce their maps 15 to 30 days in advance , to give the public time to digest them . <p> It 's a position that could be naive , or could signal something new . Ralph Reed , the former boy wonder of Christian conservatism , turns 40 next month . / PHIL SKINNER @ @
