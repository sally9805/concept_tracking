Chaper One " Now this , " Gina said , " is the life . " I was forced to agree with her . The two of us were stretched out in our bikinis , taking in the rays and balmy seventy-five-degree weather on Carmel Beach . It was March , but you would n't have known it by the way the sun was pouring down on us . Well , this was California , after all . " I mean it , " Gina said . " I do n't know how you do it every day . " I had my eyes closed . Visions of tall , icy Diet Cokes were dancing in my head . If only they had waiter service on the beach . It was the one thing missing , really . We 'd already finished all of the sodas in our cooler , and it was a really long walk up the stairs from the beach to Jimmy 's Quick Mart . " Do what ? " I murmured . " Go to school , " Gina said , " when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so away . " " It is hard , " I admitted , my eyes still closed . " But graduating from high school continues to be considered one of life 's important achievements . I mean , I 've heard that without a high school diploma , one does n't have a hope of acquiring one of those high-powered service positions at Starbucks that I know I 'll be angling for upon graduation . " " Seriously , Suze , " Gina said . I felt her stir next to me , and opened my eyes . Gina had leaned up on her elbows , and was scanning the beach through her Ray-Bans . " How can you stand it ? " How , indeed ? It wasgorgeous . The Pacific stretched out as far as the eye could see , turquoise blue darkening to navy the closer it got to the horizon . The waves were huge , crashing up against the yellow sand , tossing surfers and boogie boarders into the air as if they were pieces of driftwood . To our far right rose the green cliffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seal-strewn boulders that were the stepping stones for what eventually turned into Big Sur , a particularly rugged section of the Pacific coastline . And everywhere , the sun beat down , burning away the fog that earlier that day had threatened to ruin our plans . It was perfection . It was paradise . If only I could have gotten someone to bring me a drink . " Oh my God . " Gina tilted her Ray-Bans and peered over the rims . " Check this out . " I followed her gaze through the tortoiseshell lenses of my Donna Karans . The lifeguard , who 'd been sitting in his white tower a few yards away from our towels , suddenly leaped from his chair , his orange flotation device clutched in one hand . He landed with catlike grace in the sand , then suddenly took off toward the waves , his muscles rippling beneath his darkly tanned skin , his long blond hair flowing behind him . Tourists fumbled for their cameras while sunbathers sat up for a better look . Gulls took off in startled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifeguard 's way . Then , with his lean , muscular body making a perfect arc in the air , he dove into the waves , only to come up yards away , swimming hard and fast for a kid who was caught in an undertow . To my amusement , I saw that the kid was none other than Dopey , one of my stepbrothers , who 'd accompanied us to the beach that afternoon . I recognized his voice instantlyonce the lifeguard had pulled him back to the surfaceas he vehemently cursed at his rescuer for attempting to save his life , and embarrassing him in front of his peers . The lifeguard , to my delight , cursed right back at him . Gina , who 'd watched the drama unfold with rapt attention , said , lazily , " What a spaz . " Clearly , she had not recognized the victim . Gina had , much to my astonishment , informed me that I was incredibly lucky , because all my stepbrothers were so " cool . " Even , apparently , Dopey . Gina had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sighed , and leaned back against her towel . " That , " she said , shoving her sunglasses back into place , " was extremely disturbing . Except for the part when the hot lifeguard ran past us . That I enjoyed . " A few minutes later , the lifeguard came trudging back in our direction , looking no less handsome in wet hair than he had in dry . He swung himself up to his tower , spoke briefly into his radioprobably putting out a B.O.L.O. on Dopey : Be On the Look Out for an extremely stupid wrestler in a wetsuit , showing off for his step-sister 's best friend from out of townthen returned to scanning the waves for other potential drowning victims . " That 's it , " Gina declared suddenly . " I am in love . That lifeguard is the man I am going to marry . " See what I mean ? Total lack of discrimination . " You , " I said disgustedly , " would marry any guy in a swimsuit . " " That 's not true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hairy-backed tourist sitting in a Speedo a few yards away with his sunburned wife . " I do not , for instance , wish to marry him . " " Of course not . He 's taken . " Gina rolled her eyes . " You 're so weird . Come on , let 's go get something to drink . " We climbed to our feet and found our shorts and sandals , then wriggled into them . Leaving our towels where they were , we picked our way across the hot sand toward the steep steps that led up to the parking lot where Sleepy had left the car . " I want , " Gina declared , when we 'd reached the pavement , " a chocolate shake . Not one of those fancy gourmet ones they sell around here , either . I want a completely fake , chemically enhanced one , like they have at Mickey D 's . " " Yeah , well , " I said , trying to catch my breath . It was no joke , climbing up all those steps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kickboxing tape practically every night . " You 're going to have to go into the next town for it because there are n't any fast food places around here . " Continues ...
