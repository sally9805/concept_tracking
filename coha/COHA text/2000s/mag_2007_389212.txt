Headnote As Southern cities sprawl out toward the old plantations , black property owners could be in for a windfall-if it was n't for developers , distant relatives , and the legacy of Jim Crow . // THE LAND HAD BEEN in Roges Brown 's family since 1882 , all of 23 acres on the South Carolina coast , reverted now to oaks , magnolias , Spanish moss . Brown had played there as a child more than a half-century before . He had cleared the brush , gardened , gone crabbing down in the marsh . He knew there were no taxes owed on the land , nor any liens against it , and so he could n't understand why , at the Charleston County Courthouse , the land was being auctioned off like an abandoned car . All he could think was that it had to have something to do with the array of white lawyers and judges he 'd encountered up to this point . " Everything you have , they take from you-just take it , " he thought . A glowering , 64-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full camouflage , " ranting and raving , " his lawyer remembers , " saying someone needed to die . " When the winning bid was submitted by a black man-his own nephew , no less-Brown was stunned . He wandered Charleston for a long time afterward , " just thinking , " search and destroy , search and destroy . " Then he started writing letters to every public official he could think of , and finally he walked into the Center for Heirs ' Property Preservation in Charleston , where he told the story first to managing attorney Willie Heyward , and , much later , to me . In short , as Heyward explains it , Brown had fallen victim to the " heirs " property " conundrum that afflicts tens of thousands of people throughout the South , many of them descendants of slaves who bought plantation land after the Civil War . Through Reconstruction and the Jim Crow era , black landowners tended to stay away from the courts and rarely put their wills through the legal system ; without those official filings , title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descendants . Fractured ownership is n't generally a problem unless the land becomes valuable-at which point someone typically discovers a provision in the law allowing any heir to file suit for his cut at any time . An auction is a common result , and developers , knowing that auctions mean deals , have been known to recruit an heir to file suit against his family , or to buy the heir 's share outright and file suit themselves . They appear at auction , as one observer puts it , " rubbing their hands and licking their lips . " It has happened with particular frequency in Charleston County , where the coast is lined with old plantations and as many as 2,000 parcels of heirs ' property . Heyward can remember when few cared to be out there with the mosquitoes . Now , he says , " everyone wants to live by the marsh . Everyone wants to be by the birds and be secluded . " But as property has increased in value , black owners ' hold on it has loosened . Heyward travels the coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they might solidify their ownership ; he uses Brown 's odyssey as a case study of what can happen when a family ends up in court . " All you 've got to do is turn one heir , " Heyward says , " and everyone loses . " Or almost everyone . He and Brown took me for a tour of the land , a forest just a few miles from one of the state 's most prestigious golf courses . Heyward pointed beyond the marsh to two oak-covered islands ( " That 's the ultimate in seclusion there " ) and to the deep water that would allow yachts to dock at their owners ' doorsteps . " Believe me , " he said , " it 's an expensive piece of property . " Brown confesses it was he , years ago , who first expressed interest in selling . When his nephew , Ben Smith , came forward offering to look into the matter , Brown and several other family members agreed to let him , even though Smith was not in line to inherit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a realtor named Terry Seabrook , whose Space Co. advertises itself as " Charleston 's only full service , African-American real estate company . " She in turn got in touch with a firm called Landmark Properties Inc. , whose president was Melissa Seabrook . ( According to Terry Seabrook , the two are not related . There is no current listing for Landmark Properties in Charleston ; the attorney named as the firm 's representative in filings with the state of South Carolina , Ronald Richter , did not return Mother Jones ' phone calls . ) Brown and other family members seem to have been ready to accept Landmark 's offer of $550,000 , but a condition of the sale was a clear tide . Hoping for a quick resolution , Brown and his siblings agreed to file the suit . When , in the course of the proceedings , the land was reappraised at nearly $2 million , Brown and six other heirs broke with Smith , and the court nullified the Seabrook deal . Judge Roger M. Young ordered the land placed on the market , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he set a date for it to be auctioned . The day of the auction , August 21 , 2002 , there may have been more lawyers present than family members . As for bidders , there were only two , and one was Ben Smith , who seemed to have found someone to back his bid . ( He " may have teamed with some other investors , I do n't know , " his lawyer told me . ) Smith quickly won the land for $500,000 , a quarter of its appraised worth . The money arrived three years after the suit was filed . The suit itself had had the effect of a dinner bell , and so after the lawyers took their fees , some 70 heirs reached in for their share . Among them was an ancient woman from New York who , contrary to common belief , had never divorced the heir she 'd married 75 years before . Her share was $34,000 . Most of the rest had to content themselves with significantly less . Even long after the case was settled , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut , claiming that relatives ( " whom I know quite well " ) had never notified them of the sale . Roges Brown 's interest in the land was determined to be .74 of 1 percent , or $3,272.97 , not much more than he had paid in legal fees . Ben Smith , who did not qualify as an heir at all , got about the same by way of compensation for trying to find a buyer for the land . Everything had gone according to proper procedure , Brown 's lawyer , Edward Pritchard Jr. , told me , and he could n't understand why his client was so angry . " A lot of people , " he said , " just do n't understand how the law works . " When Brown went finally to a lawyer who charged him nothing , Heyward agreed that the family had not understood the law , but he also knew the law had not looked out for the family . Changes that would protect heirs ' property-such as mandatory mediation-depend on political clout , which in the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes Heyward , remains a culture that has changed very little . " They pride themselves on not changing , " he says . " That 's the tourist attraction . People come to Charleston to see things the way they were , not for progress . " A year after buying the land , Smith flipped it to a developer from Pinehurst , North Carolina , for double what he 'd paid at the auction-$1 million . Terry Seabrook brokered the deal . Plots next door to the property were recently selling for $200,000 an acre . For a time Smith lived directly across the street , in a gated golfing community called Hope Plantation . I wanted to ask him where he had gotten the money for the auction , but Brown said you ca n't go into Hope Plantation , not even if you 're family . When I got Smith on the phone , he did n't want to talk , and said in a cold , flat voice , " If you put my name in the paper . . . I 'm going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was going in , I told him , at which point he began to shout : " If you do that , sir , I 'm coming to find your ass , and I 'm going to put a bullet in your fucking head ! " Then he slammed down the phone and returned to the solitude of his wealth .
