" COVERT CALORIES The most seemingly innocent foods can be a nutritional minefield , according to Michele Trankina , Ph.D. , a professor of biological sciences at St. Mary 's University in San Antonio . Her take on the hidden calories in five favorites : SALAD DRESSING 140 calories Two tablespoons of mayonnaise  --  based dressings like ranch or Russian contains 140 calories and a whopping 14 grams of fat . To keep your salads healthful , top them with a small amount of oil and balsamic vinegar , or a mix of lemon juice , garlic , vinegar and olive oil .

The largest Starbucks Coconut Creme Frappuccino weighs in at 870 calories and 32 grams of fat . A better coffee option would be a skim latte or iced coffee with skim milk . BAKED POTATO 620 calories A plain spud is a healthier alternative ( 212 calories and 5 grams of fiber with the skin ) than fries . But a baked potato the way most of us order it-topped with bacon , butter , sour cream and/or cheddar cheese-can pack 620 calories and 31 grams of fat . A preferable option is with one tablespoon of butter , which has 160 calories . JUICE 110 calories Fruit juices may be loaded with vitamins , but they 're not calorie-free . For example , eight ounces of orange juice contain 110 calories , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A better bet is to eat fruit instead of drinking fruit juices .
