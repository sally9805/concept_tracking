<p> A stretch of Northside Drive in downtown Atlanta is showing early signs that it may finally evolve from a gritty highway into a prime boulevard leading to trendy neighborhoods and attractions such as the planned Georgia Aquarium . <p> Almost 600 apartments are being built in two developments near the Georgia Dome , half to open by May and the rest starting in December . And nearly 800 students of Bauder College will move from Phipps Plaza to new classrooms in a refurbished railroad warehouse . <p> The area 's proximity to downtown and Midtown is driving its rebirth , says a co-developer of one apartment complex . Several residential and commercial projects have popped up west of Northside , but they are spotty and scattered across a wide area . <p> " You ask yourself why there 's not much development on this side of town when everything on the east side  --  Midtown and Buckhead  --  has gone crazy , " says Satish Lathi , a principal with Southeast Capital Partners , which also co-developed the Museum Tower condominiums overlooking Centennial Olympic Park . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the west side , " Lathi says . " Even though it 's been severely neglected by developers and politicians , the infrastructure is horrendous and the living conditions are horrendous , the community has strong roots , and this area is too close to everything to not get redeveloped . Someone just has to get the ball rolling . " <p> This influx of new blood has the potential to spur profound changes along an important piece of asphalt blighted by years of neglect and hodgepodge development . <p> Despite its appearance , Northside Drive is a gateway from I-75 to big downtown attractions including the Georgia Dome , Philips Arena and the Georgia World Congress Center . Soon it likely will carry even more traffic as vehicles head to the Atlantic Station mega-development and Centennial Olympic Park , with its two upcoming venues , the Georgia Aquarium and World of Coca-Cola museum . <p> To reach the attractions , travelers now pass through a corridor that bears no resemblance to Peachtree Street , a parallel road that 's both a mile and a mind-set away . <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of industrial and commercial uses that has baffled urban planners for years . Any plan would remain just that until developers decided whether Northside would ever be changed . <p> ' A whole new life ' <p> Now , Atlanta 's chief planner thinks the market is showing the way . <p> " Northside Drive is taking on a whole new life , " says Atlanta Planning Commissioner Charles Graves III . " What we 're seeing is the creation of a mixed-use neighborhood that includes housing , some office , some entertainment and some major cultural attractions . " <p> The new apartments are priced for young professionals , teachers , police officers and firefighters . The buzzword is that they are " work force housing , " affordable to households with annual incomes of $50,000 or less . Monthly rates range from around $600 to above $1,400 , and some units are reserved for households with lower incomes . <p> The first new housing Northside has seen in decades is to open in mid-April or May . The M Street apartment complex is at the corner of Northside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal recycling plant . <p> Its developer , Julian LeCraw &; Co. , is a veteran builder and manager of intown apartments and condos . M Street is the company 's first foray into Atlanta 's emerging market of work force housing . The city provided $30 million in low-interest construction funding in exchange for LeCraw 's setting aside some of the 308 units for low-income households . <p> " This project is a forerunner for us , and we are very upbeat and optimistic about doing more of this kind of work , " says Michael Tompkins , LeCraw 's president . " There 's a need for work force housing in the city , and there is a trend in the Marietta Street , Howell Mill Road and Northside Drive area to rebuild . We 're on the leading edge , there 's no doubt about it . But it 's all part of the trend of people moving inside the Perimeter . " <p> The transitional nature of the area is underscored by the potential tenants of the 8,500 square feet of retail space in the project . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coffee shops and dry cleaners , but professionals such as tax preparers and lawyers , Tompkins says . <p> " Retail is the $64,000 question , " he says . <p> Wariness over crime <p> Just south of M Street , another apartment complex is being built by Southeast Capital Partners and an affiliate of historic Antioch Baptist Church North . Like M Street , the project received low-interest financing through the city in exchange for setting aside some units for low-income renters . <p> Northside Village Apartments is almost directly across Northside Drive from the Georgia Dome . Side streets reach quickly into some of Atlanta 's most crime-ridden neighborhoods , a fact that Lathi , the co-developer , says was noted by lenders . <p> " When we were putting the financing together , a lot of lenders and equity investors wondered why we wanted to build new apartments here , when apartments in Midtown were giving away three months ' free rent to get tenants , " Lathi says . <p> " Our market research showed that , while the rest of Atlanta 's apartment market was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90 percent occupied , " he says . " People in this community would stay in substandard housing vs. leaving to get free rent . There 's a demand in this community for high-quality , affordable housing , and that 's what we will provide . " <p> Charter school on hold <p> Northside Village will be the first phase of development on 16 acres assembled by Antioch Baptist along Northside Drive . A charter school was part of the initial plan , but it was put on the back burner after Atlanta school officials questioned its impact on nearby public schools . <p> This is n't the first urban redevelopment project by Antioch Baptist . The church was involved in rehabilitating an old railroad repair yard into the funky Northyards Business Park , which opened in 2001 . While it was critically acclaimed as a historic preservation effort , no one signed a lease there until last year . <p> Bauder College has leased 61,000 square feet , nearly one-fourth of the renovated space . The school is growing dramatically , having doubled its enrollment to nearly 800 in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fashion design institute , offers associate degrees in fields including legal studies , design and business . <p> City Councilman Ivory Young , who represents the area , says the fact that lenders did step forward at Northside Village underscores the pending renewal of the surrounding Vine City community . This area west of Northside Drive has been stagnant since the early 1970s , when construction started on the Georgia World Congress Center . Neither the center nor the Georgia Dome has had much positive effect on the neighborhood . <p> " Northside Village dispels the myth and rumor that there is no economic development interest in a neighborhood that sits in the shadow of the central business district , " Young says . " Vine City is on the verge of introducing a redevelopment plan that 's a full mixed-use development that will range upward of $100 million . And we are working on plans for the Simpson Road corridor , Dixie Hills and Hunter Hills . " <p> The Wild West <p> From a ridgetop with a view of the area , the developer of an apartment building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a toehold in a challenging environment . Alta West was built after a similar scramble by Wood Partners , which has successful projects in Midtown and Inman Park . <p> Bill Bollwerk , a Wood director , uses Wild West imagery to describe his view of building Alta West . He sees the apartments as a settlement in territory opened by the early pioneers who came to west Midtown more than a decade ago . <p> " We thought we were settlers , but the capital markets still viewed us as pioneers , and it was tough to finance , " Bollwerk says . " But we got financing and we 're almost fully leased , with fewer concessions than in the Midtown market . We like it over here . " Northside Drive is expected to improve as residents move into two new apartment complexes and college students attend classes in Northyards Business Park .
