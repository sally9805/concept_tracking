Hey , Ali . I found you a man . " Allison Thomas blinked sleepily and thought about hiding her head under the pillow ; however , the phone pressed against her ear might get in the way . " Was I looking for one ? " she asked . " Sure . You 've been bugging me for weeks . " There was a pause , followed by an impatient sigh . " Ali , it 's me , Harry . " Ali pushed the pillow away and sat up . " Harry ? " Her sluggish brain pulled together random bits of information . Harry , the local handyman . Her business downstairs . How Harry had been teasing her with the promise of doing actual work for weeks on her business downstairs . " Are you finally going to build my shelves ? " " Nope . I 've hired me a new guy . If this one works out , I think he 'll stay around and buy me out . " Ali resisted the urge to roll her eyes . Harry was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer than a week , Harry became convinced he 'd finally found someone interested in buying his small handyman business . " I hope that happens , " she said sincerely . " In the meantime , is he going to do some work for me ? " " Sure thing . I 've already sent him over to start your shelves . I 'll be by this afternoon to check on his progress . " " Okay . Great . " She was drowning in office supplies , cooking supplies , and mailing containers . She needed more stock space in her storage room . While Harry was n't known for hiring the brightest bulbs in the chandelier , how hard could it be to make a few shelves and paint some walls ? She could probably do it herself if she had the time , which she did n't . " When can I expect him ? " " He should be there any minute . " " Okay . " Ali blinked , then sat up straighter in bed . " What ? Like now ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's walking . " Ali glanced down at the soft cotton T-shirt that barely came to midthigh . Underneath she wore exactly nothing . Her hair was a mess ; she was a mess , and not the least prepared for Harry 's helper . She swore under her breath . " Next time give me a little more warning , Harry , " she said . " You 're welcome . " His cheerful reply set her teeth on edge . She hung up the phone , then scrambled out of bed . It was nearly eight , and on a normal morning she would have been awake for hours . Or at least since seven . But work had kept her up well past midnight . Again . Ali pulled off her sleep shirt and tossed it onto the four-poster , brass bed . She grabbed underwear , a bra , jeans and a T-shirt that proclaimed her " Queen of Everything " and dressed . When she dug in her closet for sneakers , she found one and had to waste precious minutes searching for the mate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clean up the floor in here and get a shoe organizer , the kind with the clear front so she could see where everything was . Or , if she really went wild , she could hire one of those anal-retentive people who made their living organizing other people 's lives . That 's what she really needed . A reorganized life . In the meantime she would settle for a pair of matching shoes . " Gotcha , " she murmured , spotting a familiar green shoelace sticking out from under the bed . She skipped socks and shoved her feet into the shoes , sidestepping the circling of her black-and-white cat , Domino . Ali then turned around to stare into the mirror . As usual , her long dark hair was a tangled riot of curls . On models in magazines the disarray looked artful . On her it looked like a scary " before " shot in a makeover . No time , she thought and rooted through the piles of clips , makeup , and jewelry on the top of her dresser until she found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine how awful she looked no makeup and a thick bushy cat 's tail of hair . Not to mention the T-shirt and jeans faded from too many washings . Ali shrugged . She was busy , which meant she did n't always have time to make a fashion statement . Okay , she never had time , and any statement she made should n't be repeated . Less than two minutes later she dashed out of the bathroom and headed downstairs , just in time to hear someone impatiently pounding on the back door . " I 'm coming , " she yelled , jogging through the stockroom . But the person on her back porch was n't Harry 's mystery helper . Instead , her mother tall , slender , and perfectly groomed stood there , with a pale , leashed pig at her side . Ali sighed . Most people were allowed to start their day with a cup of coffee and a few minutes to peruse the local paper . She had to face her mother . " Took you long enough , " Charlotte Elizabeth Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear room of the shop . " Miss Sylvie and I thought we 'd stop by and have coffee after our walk . " Her mother 's gaze narrowed . " You did n't even brush your hair this morning . And what is that you 're wearing ? " " Jeans , Mother . A denim fabric made into slacks for both women and men . " " Sarcasm does not make you more attractive , Allison . " Charlotte Elizabeth bent down and unfastened the leash from Miss Sylvie 's collar . The nearly albino pig trotted over to Ali and snuffled at her scuffed sneakers . Ali was n't sure if it was a greeting or a criticism , nor did she want to know . Charlotte Elizabeth turned and headed for the kitchen . " We did an hour around the pond . The doctor said that with proper exercise , the heart condition wo n't be a problem , " Charlotte Elizabeth called over her shoulder . " I prefer walking here , rather than in Los Angeles . The sea air is very refreshing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her mother , following her into the kitchen , then watching as Charlotte Elizabeth worked , filling the coffee pot with water and pouring it into the machine . After she added six scoops of flavored coffee , she shut the front flap and hit the start button . " I 'm relieved to hear the positive medical news , " Ali said , trying to muster some enthusiasm and sincerity . They were , after all , talking about the pig 's heart , not her mother 's . But while Ali did n't understand her mother 's devotion to the large , ungainly animal , Charlotte Elizabeth and Miss Sylvie were inseparable . How did an otherwise intelligent , articulate person make such a poor pet choice ? Why could n't her mother be like other people 's eccentric relatives and just collect dozens of cats or small dogs ? Ali could understand the appeal of a stray . She 'd had several herself over the years . But a pig ? And not one of those cute miniature ones . Miss Sylvie was several hundred pounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was that pigs had . Charlotte Elizabeth patted her pig 's large back . " I think this new sunscreen is going to work . Did I tell you about it ? I found it in a catalog . I do so love mail order . The sunscreen is organic and practically guaranteed not to produce an allergic reaction . Something I worry about , do n't I , sweetheart ? " Miss Sylvie grunted in response . " You could carry it here in the store . " Ali looked at her mother . " The sunscreen ? " " You like natural products . " " This is a sweet shop , Mother . Chocolates , cookies , scones , and muffins . Not a sunscreen kind of place . " " I suppose not . Although it would n't hurt you to expand . Speaking of which muffins , I mean , not expanding do you still have those low-fat ones in your freezer ? " " Yes . " Ali pointed to the freezer at the far end of the huge kitchen . " I baked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her mother opened the door and gazed at the labeled packages inside . " Three dozen is excellent . That 's seventy-five percent of what you baked . Not bad for a new product . " If only , Ali thought . " No , Mom . I sold three muffins . I had to freeze the other forty-five . " She 'd learned her lesson . Low-fat anything did not sell well at Decadent Delight . People traveled great distances for her gourmet chocolate and when they got here , they did n't want to think about healthy foods or saving calories . " At least they wo n't go to waste . I thought instead of a scone , I could start giving Miss Sylvie a low-fat muffin . " Her mother glanced up and smiled . " She does so like a treat with her coffee in the morning . " Ali stared at her mother 's beautiful face . Charlotte Elizabeth had wide hazel eyes , a small nose , and a perfect mouth . There was a symmetry to her features that left lesser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her mother had smooth and practically wrinkle-free skin . Some of that was the result of carefully planned surgery , but most of it was just great genetics . Ali , of course , took after her father . Charlotte Elizabeth found the large container of muffins and took one out . She set it on a plate , then put it in the microwave tucked in the corner of the counter near the double metal sink . While she waited , she glanced through the open doorway leading to Ali 's storeroom and frowned . Her sharp gaze took in the stacks of supplies for the store , the office , and the kitchen . Unopened bags of sugar nestled up against boxes of mailing envelopes . " That place is a disaster . You should get some shelves in there . " " Funny you mention that , " Ali said , but figured there was no point in explaining the renovation was already planned . In fact , Harry 's helper should be arriving any minute . Please God , she thought sincerely , let him get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my mother . The microwave beeped at the same time the coffeemaker gave a discreet chime indicating it had taken grounds and water to produce warm , liquid magic . Miss Sylvie came trotting in from wherever she 'd been and grunted with pleasure . " Just a moment , darling , " Charlotte Elizabeth said . She cut up the muffin and blew on it to cool it down . Then she poured coffee into a saucer and blew on that as well . " Did you ever treat me this nicely when I was a child ? " Ali asked as she watched the ritual . " Of course . Do n't you remember ? " " Not really . I think Rick and I got shortchanged . Miss Sylvie gets a lot more attention . " Ali was only half kidding . Did her mother 's behavior still fall in the " normal " range , or did it slip over into a more scary category ? And was any of it due to old age ? " Mom , have you been getting forgetful lately ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saucer and the plate on the floor and stroked her pet . " If you 're trying to imply there 's something wrong with me , I wo n't listen . I lavish love on Miss Sylvie because I do n't have grandchildren to spoil . I 'm nearly sixty . I deserve grandchildren . " " Sixty-five , " Ali said patiently , knowing she only had herself to blame for the tirade about to rain down on her like a winter storm . There would be flashes of both lightning and thunder , not to mention dark clouds and chilling temperatures . They 'd been over this material countless times before . Why had n't she let well enough alone ? So her mother had a strange relationship with a pig . Was that so unhealthy ? " Do n't try to distract me with the truth , " her mother said as she poured herself a cup of coffee . " As I was saying , if you had bothered to get married and have babies of your own like other people 's children do , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a career and a business . I had to get a pig so I would have something to spoil and cuddle in my old age . " Ali glanced at Miss Sylvie 's considerable bulk . The pig was cute , especially when her mother dressed her up in seasonal jackets and rakish hats , but she was far from a lap pet . " How exactly do you cuddle her ? " " You know what I mean . " Actually Ali did n't , but she figured it was n't a good time to ask . Nor did she really want to know . " Do you want coffee ? " her mother asked . Ali nodded . She needed the jolt of caffeine to keep her wits about her . Charlotte Elizabeth was many things , but she was n't stupid . And she could be stubborn when she did n't get her way . If Ali did n't distract her soon , she was going to be hearing about the woes of being grandchildless for the rest of the morning . To make matters worse , Ali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately , Charlotte Elizabeth was n't one for keeping track of birthdays , and this year she would be in Los Angeles on Ali 's birthday weekend . With a little luck , her big " three-zero " would pass in unrecognized silence . Of course if Charlotte Elizabeth did manage to remember , Ali would never hear the end of it . In Charlotte Elizabeth 's mind , turning thirty without a husband or even the hint of a man in her life was a fate worse than death . It was worse than a new wrinkle . Ali 's private guilt on the subject of grandchildren did n't help . In the recesses of her mind , she knew she owed her mother grandchildren and much more . " You look very nice , " Ali said abruptly . It was a feeble first attempt to change the subject , but the best she could come up with under pressure . Fortunately , it was also true . Her mother wore a pink jogging suit that should have looked frumpy and added the appearance of an additional ten or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother she was talking about . Of course Charlotte Elizabeth managed to look both stylish and reed slim . Maybe it had something to do with her having been an actress for many years . Charlotte Elizabeth always had the correct outfit for every occasion and the psychic knowledge to know exactly when to wear it . " Do n't for a moment think that I 've gone so senile that you can distract me with a silly compliment , " her mother said , glaring at her . " What about my grandchildren ? " Ali groaned . It was n't that she did n't want a child . She did desperately . But on her terms and schedule . Not her mother 's . Taking a breath , she threw out another subject to distract her mother . " I really wish I looked as great as you . " " You could with a little effort . " " Time is the one thing I do n't have a lot of . " " Time and effort are n't always the same thing . You could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lesson from Clair , who always looks elegant . She 's not too busy to make herself attractive . " Ali winced . Done in by her best friend . Damn . To make matters worse , Ali could n't even claim her life was too complicated by comparison , either . Clair managed to be nearly as put-together as Charlotte Elizabeth while raising two kids , being married , chairing a major charity in Los Angeles , and occasionally assisting her husband in his winery . Oh , and she was pregnant . All Ali could claim was a candy store and a cat . Charlotte Elizabeth studied her daughter critically . " You 're 5 ' 6 " , which is n't model tall , but it 's not so short you have to worry about styles not looking right on you . " Ali closed her eyes and sighed . Her mother was on a roll , and she had no one to blame but herself . " You have my breasts and my legs , " Charlotte Elizabeth continued . " Both of which are spectacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asked to pose topless . I refused , of course . It would have been tacky . But it would n't kill you to show a little cleavage sometimes , or a bit of thigh . And you have lovely large eyes , dear . Take advantage of that . Get a makeover . Or I would be happy to " Miss Sylvie finished her morning coffee and muffin and came snuffling for more . The pig managed to do what Ali had n't been able to and distracted her mother . " No , darling . That 's all you get . You need to watch what you eat . Your heart , dear . Remember ? " Miss Sylvie 's little pig eyes seemed to dampen with disappointment . She went back to snuffle at the now empty plate . " What about my grandchildren ? " Charlotte Elizabeth demanded again . Ali did n't know which was worse . The " I want grandchildren " speech or the makeover speech . " Leave me alone . If you want pretty , find a model . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother made a moue of disapproval . " First , it 's not nice of you to say that . Rick is a lovely young man , but he has his limitations . As a rule , gay men do n't have children that often . Second , he 's my stepson , not my child by blood . It would n't be the same . " " So telling you to go rent a grandchild would n't work either ? I bet Clair would loan you one of hers . " Charlotte Elizabeth sighed . " You know , I always tried to be a good mother . Was n't I there for you ? Did n't I bake cookies for you and always ask about your day ? " " You did ask me about school , but I do n't remember you baking . " Charlotte Elizabeth considered . " All right , but I paid someone to bake , so there were always cookies at home . That counts . " Actually , in Ali 's mind it did count , but she would n't dare give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a husband , and we 'll talk grandchildren . Until then , leave me alone . " As soon as the words were out of her mouth , she wanted to call them back . She knew better than to issue a challenge to anyone in her family , especially her mother . Perfectly shaped eyebrows arched toward perfectly trimmed bangs . " Really ? " Her mother drew out the word for nearly four seconds . Ali scrambled to regain lost ground . " No . I was kidding . Ha ha . Pretty funny , huh ? Had you going , did n't I ? " Charlotte Elizabeth was not moved . Fortunately at that moment , someone knocked on the backdoor . " That would be Harry 's helper , " Ali said . " Harry sent him over to build me some shelves . " " Allow me , " Charlotte Elizabeth said and headed toward the rear of the building . Ali stared after her and tried to figure out why her mother would care about the handyman . Charlotte Elizabeth preferred her world to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bothered with the details of repairs or construction . She just wanted Ali swore out loud and raced after her mother . Harry 's helper did the poor man have a name ? was a new guy in town . Ali had just issued a challenge . If the man had most of his own teeth and no really large hump on his back or his nose , Charlotte Elizabeth might just try to Ali came to a stop . Too late . Conversation drifted in through the half-open storeroom door , and she could only stand there , frozen , humiliated , and eavesdropping . " Tell me , Mr .... Baker was it ? " " Yes , ma'am . But you can call me Matt . " " All right . Tell me , Matt , are you married ? " Ali closed her eyes and leaned against the doorframe of her storage room . This was n't happening . Really . If she just visualized another scene , another place , or perhaps even another time , she would find herself magically transported there . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humiliated by her mother . Something breathed against her foot . She glanced down and saw Miss Sylvie checking out her shoe again . Apparently the muffin had n't been satisfying . " I 'm only asking because my daughter , Allison , is very lovely . She 's also single . Not because there 's anything wrong with her . She 's been busy . " Strangled laughter forced its way up Ali 's tight throat . Busy ? Was that the best her mother could come up with to explain her lack of male companionship ? Busy ? As in " If only she could get that last sock drawer organized , she could see to her personal life ? " Ali heard someone clearing his throat , and she guessed it was n't her mother . The masculine voice that followed confirmed her guess . " Ma'am , I 'm just here about the shelves . " " Oh . " Pounds of disappointment thickened Charlotte Elizabeth 's voice . " You do n't like women . I understand . Well , my son Rick is gay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . And even if he was n't , while I do n't begrudge him his happiness , I was really hoping for a more traditional match . " She paused and then spoke confidentially . " You see , I want grandchildren . " " Ma'am , I 'm not gay . I 'm here to build shelves . " Ali could feel the flush of embarrassment on her cheeks . Even so , she forced herself to push away from the wall and step around Miss Sylvie . This had gone on long enough . " Mother , leave the poor man alone , " she said briskly as she headed for the door . Obviously the only way to get through this incredibly humiliating moment was to ignore the fact that her own mother had hawked her like some used rocking chair at a garage sale . " Harry 's helper is here to put up shelves , not be tormented by you . " She stepped onto the porch and smiled brightly . " Hi . I 'm Allison Thomas . You 've already met my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun was well above the horizon . Light flooded the porch , momentarily causing her to blink as her eyes adjusted . Then she had to blink because Harry 's helper was n't the usual brand of misfit he liked to hire . This guy she blinked again and had to look up was way too tall and way too good-looking . " He does n't want Rick , " Charlotte Elizabeth said cheerfully . " So I guess he 's all yours . "
