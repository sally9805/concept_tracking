Dr. Andrew Chishom , a criminal justice professor , says that women today have the freedom to do things once considered taboo . // Men long have been regarded as the usual suspects when it comes to crime and violence . But a growing body of research on crime shows that the gender line is indeed breaking down . The past three decades alone have witnessed a dramatic rise in female  --  authored crimes and that sharp increase is reflected by the growing number of women on our nation 's prison rolls . In 1970 there were about 6,000 women incarcerated in federal and state prisons , says Dr. Andrew Chishom , a criminal justice professor at the University of South Carolina . Fifteen years later , the number had jumped to 22,000 , and by the mid ' 90s it had skyrocketed to 75,000 and is growing steadily at a rate of nearly 11 percent a year , he indicates . New Justice Department statistics place the number of women currently behind bars at almost 90,000 ! So what has sparked this sudden upswing in crime by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's disproportionately high rate of poverty , women 's increased access to areas of crime formerly dominated by males , and the overall increase of violence and crime are some possible explanations for the surge . " Women still lag behind men significantly in terms of their numbers in prison , " Dr. Chishom says . They are a small fraction of the nearly 1.9 million total adults incarcerated . " But the most significant thing is that crime accelerated at a greater percentage among women than for men in the same reporting period , " Chishom adds . The disparity in earnings that still exists between women and men in general and for Black women in particular , known as the feminization of poverty , is a likely cause for that upsurge . " There is a long-standing association between poverty and crime , " says Dr. BarBara Scott , a professor of sociology and women 's studies at Northeastern Illinois University ( NIU ) and chair of NIU 's departments of criminal justice , social work , sociology and women 's studies . " When you factor in race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a disproportionate percentage of AfricanAmericans who are poor . Women are disproportionately poor compared to men and Black women are far more disproportionately poor than other groups of women . " Of course everyone who is poor is not going to resort to crime for survival , Dr. Scott says , " but poverty certainly does lead to a higher probability of crime . " Another possible reason for the surge in crime among women concerns something sociologists refer to as the " liberation hypothesis . " Women , because of their gender , their status as consumers and their lack of access to certain institutions in society , typically have been confined to crimes such as shoplifting , credit card and welfare fraud and prostitution . Photograph A Sociologist Dr. BarBara Scott cites the feminization of poverty " as a possible read son for the increase in crime by women . // But as society moves toward greater gender equality and women gain more access to legitimate arenas , such as employment and education , they also gain access to once-restricted avenues of crime . " Similar to opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in education , in the military and other areas , crime opportunities literally opened up , " informs Dr. Chishom , noting that the 1980s brought a marked change in the types of crime in which women participated . " They started involving themselves in crimes that historically have been male-dominated crimes , " says Dr. Chishom , who also serves as director of the University of South Carolina 's Southern Region Violence &; Substance Abuse Prevention Center . " The murder rate among women went up significantly , crimes against property went up significantly as well as street crimes dealing with substance abuse . " Women entered the growing illegal drug trade as smugglers and dealers . " Quite frankly women became more daring , " he says , and more confident in competing with men in male-dominated crimes . Another possible reason for the rise in female offenders , particularly in the case of violent offenders , may have something to do with the increasingly violent nature of our society . While Dr. Scott clarifies that it 's not a cause-and-effect relationship , she admits there is a correlation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increase in violent crimes by women and men alike . " We are very apathetic when it comes to violence , " she says . " Violence is everywhere in the media and it has become an accepted way of dealing with frustration and aggression , and it 's not just men . " Women account for about 14 percent , 2.1 million , of all violent offenders , informs Dr. Zina McGee , a sociology professor at Hampton University who specializes in criminology and juvenile delinquency . However the vast majority of those women ( 3 out of 4 ) commit only simple assault , which does n't involve a weapon , she says . Again the liberation hypothesis comes into play . The confidence women gained from breaking through gender barriers in American society flowed into other areas as well , experts inform . As women achieve greater parity with men on all levels , women find they too can engage in behavior , specifically violent behavior , that once was deemed inappropriate for ladies . " Women are freer to do things that were once taboo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Chishom says , citing a rise in the past three decades in female-on-male domestic violence , in women involved in robberies and carrying weapons in offenses , and in women committing child abuse . While the experts cite rising violence , the feminization of poverty and greater gender equality as likely reasons for the growth in female crime , they warn against drawing quick conclusions based solely on the numbers . " Recently there 's been some research conducted and some statements have been made about the new female violent criminal , " Dr. McGee says . " But we have to be very careful in terms of what that means , that more likely we 're seeing more women arrested for certain crimes than the actual crimes themselves . " Statistical increases in crime among women may indeed reflect a greater law-and-order mentality in our society in recent decades than an actual increase in crime , experts say . A mentality that sadly results in Blacks and Black women being arrested , convicted and held to more stringent standards than Whites , experts inform . Photograph Dr. Zina McGee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are victims of gender , race and class oppression . // " When you look at the prison system , there are different standards for Blacks and Whites-period , " Dr. Chishom asserts . " It 's a shame 70 to 80 percent of inmates are AfricanAmerican . How can you say equality exists with these statistics ? " Whether the statistics are completely on point with the reality or not , experts still say we can not ignore the growing number of women convicts and those factors that contribute to a woman who turns to crime . " Many of the women we speak of are victims of triple jeopardy-class , race and gender oppression , " Dr. McGee says . " Many of the female offenders have been victims themselves and the problem is that our society is not willing to address these different layers of victimization . As a result , she is being processed and labeled as a new violent offender . In many cases , she is not . " - NICOLE WALKER <p>             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
