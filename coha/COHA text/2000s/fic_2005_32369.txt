Hot &; Heavy By Sandra Hill Dorchester Publishing Sandra Hill Playing possum ... Ian blacked out for only a second , but he remained still , flat on his stomach , arms stretched forward , one hand holding his assault rifle . He deliberately kept his eyes closed to a bare slit . He waited while the woman circled him tentatively , checking for signs of life , he would guess . First , she toed him on the side to see if he would move , which he did n't . Then the nutcase pinched his buttock ... as if that would cause him to move . He barely felt a thing . He 'd only got a brief glimpse of her before being struck , but , man , she was some kind of wild thing . She would scare the bejesus out of someone in the dark , for sure . Plus , she reeked to high heaven . He could easily jump her now , but decided to wait and see what she was up to . More important , who she was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cat Two to Cat One . Contact ? Contact ? Cat Two to Cat One . " Cage kept saying into Ian 's earphone . When in hostile territory , real names were not used over radio lines which could be intercepted . Since this was Operation Rodent , each member of Ian 's squad had named themselves Cat One , Cat Two and so on . The upper chain of command had names of well-known cats , such as Garfield and Sylvester . It was a joke among the teams that none of the flag rankswould take the name Puss , as in Puss in Boots . When the woman moved to his legs , he whispered into his throat mike , without moving his lips . " Cat One here . Do you read ? I 'm okay . " " Roger . I 'm watchin ' your six . Need help ? " " Not yet . Woman here . Watch for others . Alert team . " " Did you say something ? " the woman shrieked , coming back to his head area . He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to silence . " Bloody hell , I best hurry afore he wakens , " the woman said in an odd accent . Ian decided to play possum for a while to see what was up . * * * My cave is your cave , honey ... Madrene started to drag the man farther into the cave by his outstretched arms . He was still facedown . " Loki 's Lips ! " she swore under her breath . " He must weigh as much as a war horse . Must be I am weakened by my escape ... and lack of food . " In the end , it took her a considerable time to pull and shove his large body , huffing and puffing the whole while . The villain appeared to be as tall as the men in her family , from his helmeted head to his booted feet . Lean , but well-muscled . Instead of Arab garb , an odd fabric covered his wide shoulders , narrow waist and long legs . It was a mixture of browns , green , and blacks ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His hands were covered with fingerless gloves . In one of those hands had been a strange , molded object made of iron , or some similar product ; it had been slipped from his fingers when she 'd started tugging . Was it a club ? I should just kill him , one part of her said . Yeech ! the other part countered . It would be done in self defense ... of a sort , her hardened side argued . Hmpfh ! Killing is killing . Mayhap I will kill him later . Yea , later is good . Madrene had no idea why she hesitated . She had killed in the past . She was not proud of the fact , but it had become a reality of her life after being left alone to safeguard Norstead . Fighting men needed a leader , and she 'd been forced to take on that role . But usually it had been done to save her life or that of one of her hird of soldiers . And if she ever faced Steirolf again , she would surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nifhelm . She sighed with resignation . She needed to know more about this man before dispatching him to the afterworld . Was he one of Fakhir 's men , come to take her back for punishment ? That would merit death . Or some other man with ill intent ? That , too , would merit death . What a fool I am ! I should have killed him outright . But she could not bring herself to do so until she discerned his intent . It was a weakness of hers , she supposed . Her father and brothers would not have hesitated . I should turn him over and see if he has any hidden weapons . Nay , I must needs restrain him first lest he awaken . With quick efficiency , she removed his large cloth pouch with shoulder straps off the man 's back . Then she tore two long strips from the hem of her robe , thus leaving it only mid-calf . Wrenching the man 's arms behind his back , she bound his wrists tightly . She did the same for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cave to survey the area for any of his comrades that might be lurking about . There were none . She swept the ground with a leafy branch to hide any foot prints . When she came back inside , she saw that he still lay facedown in the same spot . She rolled him over with a bare foot . " Eeeeek ! " she screamed . It was a monster she had captured . Not only was his face black with only his eyelids and lips showing up white , but there was an appendage coming out of his ear and around his face to rest in front of his mouth , like a grasshopper . A man-beast , that is what he must be . A troll . She had heard of such in the sagas spun by the skalds of old , but never believed in them . Till now . Bending over , she touched a fingertip to his cheek and saw that some of the black came off . Ahhh . Face paint , like the Scottish warriors wear when going into battle . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A troll-soldier . Hmmmm . Just then , his eyes shot wide open , which made his appearance even more bizarre , the white of his eyes surrounded by all that black . Immediately , he tried to lurch upward but realized that he was restrained hand and foot . She jumped backwards , just in case . He let himself fall back to the ground and looked up at her . He seemed just as surprised and repulsed at her appearance as she was at his . " Jesus , who are you ? " he asked . English . The troll-man spoke the Saxon English . Just my luck to be saddled not only with a troll , but a bloody Saxon as well . " Nay , I am not Jesus , " she replied . The man 's head wound must have rendered him senseless . " Jes ... what ? " " I ... am ... not ... Jesus , " she said , very slowly , so he could comprehend her meaning . " Holy hell ! I know you 're not Jesus . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before she could hold her tongue . ' T was not wise to give the enemy too much information . " Yasmine ? " he repeated , mishearing her . His eyes went wide with wonder . " Yea , that is who I am . Yasmine . " What a dolt ! Narrowing his eyes , he reverted to the Arabic tongue and asked , " Are you Yasmine ? " " I already said I was , " she snapped back , also in Arabic . A double dolt , that is what I have here . " You speak Arabic . " The troll-man smiled then , which made him look almost appealing , and at the same time ridiculous in that black face with white eyes and teeth . " Sonofabitch ! Talk about wandering in a field of shit and landing in a gold mine , " he muttered to himself , or was he speaking into that appendage . Well perhaps not that appealing . " What is your name ? " she inquired in English , a language which came easier to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own Norse . He hesitated , then disclosed . " Ian MacLean . " " A Scotsman ! I should have known , " she said , throwing her hands up with disgust . " What 's wrong with a Scotsman ? " he asked , working himself into a sitting position , then wiggling his arse back so his head rested against the cave wall , his long legs outstretched . " Hah ! Sneaky thieves , that 's what they are . Always stealing cattle and such . And they eat that horrible haggis . " He shook his head as if he could n't believe what she was saying . Betimes she had that effect on men . " Are you the one who knocked me out ? " She nodded . " Why ? " Questions , questions , questions ! Does everything have to have an explanation ? She shrugged . " Every soldier knows to take the offensive . Attack before being attacked . " " You a soldier ? " he scoffed . " Betimes . " I should have knocked him harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What makes you think I would have attacked you ? " Now that is a silly question . " You were carrying a club . " " Huh ? " She pointed to the iron object . " That 's a weapon , for chrissake . An assault rifle , to be precise . " Madrene had n't a clue what he just said . " Let me go , " he demanded . Does this man truly not understand that I am the one in charge here ? " Are you demented ? Nay , I will not release you . In fact , I am thinking about killing you . " He arched his eyebrows . " What 's stopping you ? " How do I know ? " That is not for you to know . " He seemed to accept her answer ... for now . The man is extremely calm , considering his position . " Are you not fearful of death ? " He pondered her question a moment . " I 'm not afraid to die ... but I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your English sounds ... odd , " he remarked . " Nay , your English sounds odd . " " Now that we have established that we 're both odd , what is that ungodly stink in here ? " He sniffed several times , then looked pointedly at her . Her face heated with embarrassment . " Well , you would smell , too , if you had not bathed in more than a sennight , especially in this heat , " she said indignantly . In truth , her underarm scent was enough to turn her own stomach . " A sennight ? What 's a sennight ? " " Seven days . " " Why did n't you just say a week ? " " Huh ? Were you sent by Fakhir ? " He frowned with confusion and repeated back to her , " Was I sent to fuck her ? " Then , " Fuck who ? " " Oh , you vulgar beast ! I said Fakhir , not ... that other word . " He smiled again . And Madrene felt an odd flutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed it must be hunger pangs . Just then , she could swear she heard talking coming from his ear/mouth appendage accompanied by a sort of buzzing noise . Rather like a bee buzz , she decided . He really was not human then . " Are you a bug ? " she blurted out . The buzzing , as well as the talking , stopped . " No , I 'm a SEAL . " " That is ridiculous . " I better watch him closely . My blow to his head must have turned him barmy . " No more ridiculous than asking me if I 'm a bug . " Should I just humor the man ? " Where is your glacier ? Did it melt in this excessive heat ? Ha , ha , ha . " " I am not a bug . I am a SEAL , " he said , not at all amused by her little jest . I have had enough of this nonsense . The lackwit is trying to make me out the lackwit when it is clear that he fits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bee . You have a bug-like appendage sticking out of your ear . You 're ugly as a ... bug . " " Are you for real ? " " What ? You think you are dreaming me ? Methinks you might be an idiot . " " There 's only one idiot here , and it 's not me . " He exhaled with a whoosh like men are wont to do when women have outwitted them . " Have you ever heard the proverb , ' Silence is golden ' ? " " Are you saying I talk too much ? " " If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck , it must be a duck . " " Is that another proverb ? If so , it is lackwitted . " " I like proverbs , and that 's a very good proverb . By the way , how long have you been living in this cozy cave ? " " Since this morn , " she answered . " Are you alone ? " " Dost thou see anyone else here ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone else know about this cave ? " " I hope not . " " Why are you here ? " " I am running away . " Now , why did I tell him that ? Why am I telling him anything ? " From whom ? " " That bloody Arab who calls himself my master . " My tongue must have a mind of its own . " Really ? That 's interesting . So , you 're not with him by choice ? " " Of course not . Do I look like a harem houri ? " " Not like any whore , I 've ever seen . " He gave her a sweeping head to toe scrutiny , and it was not complimentary . Her grimy feet and exposed calves got special attention . " I do not appreciate your insult . " She put a hand to her head and figured her hair must look like a haystack . " What insult ? " " Calling me a whore . " " Hey ! I 'm not the one who mentioned a whore first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " You halfbrain ! I said houri , not whore . " He grinned then . " Someone tried to make you into a harem girl ? " The oaf ! Apparently he 'd known what a houri was all along . " Pfff ! Nine men tried these past three years . None succeeded . I have developed a knack for making a sultan 's manpart wilt . So , best you not try any of that bedplay with me . " If I had a needle and thread , I would sew my mouth shut . Be quiet , Madrene . He is quite possibly an enemy . Stop giving him information . His jaw went slack with astonishment . " This is the most incredible conversation I 've ever had with a woman . Let me get this straight . You escaped from some Arab sultan , and- " " The last one was a sheikh . " It was a flaw in her personality that she always needed to correct mistakes . " You escaped from an Arab sheikh , in fact nine different Arab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Stop interrupting . " " Interrupting is one of my talents , or so the men in my family always complained . " She could swear she heard laughter coming from his appendage . He exhaled with exasperation , just like her father used to do when she nagged him endlessly . " You escaped from nine different Arabs who tried to make you their harem girl , and you were passed from one to the other because you can make their cocks wilt . " " Precisely . " She smiled at him before she caught herself and frowned some more . " How did you get to be with the first ... sultan ? " " Ah , that is a long and painful story . " He glanced at his bound legs . " It does n't appear as if I 'm going anywhere soon . " " I am a noble woman in my own country . " " You 're not Arab ? " " Nay . " Why he was surprised she could not say . Surely she did not resemble Arab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mayhap they had darkened during her sojourn in this land . " Where do you come from ? " Once again , she cautioned herself not to disclose too much information . She thought a moment and said , " The Rus lands . " " You 're Russian ? " Shock showed on his face and he muttered something about the Pent-dragon going to be interested in that information . One thing stood out to Madrene in his mutterings . The word dragon . Yea , he must indeed be a troll who lived in the land of dragons . Just then , there appeared to be a lot of chatter coming from his appendage . " Lower the volume on my headset , " he ordered her . " Huh ? Who are you to give me orders ? " " My headset . Turn it down , dammit . " " Why do you want me to turn down the set of your head ? Does it hurt ? " " Adjust the frickin ' volume , here , near my ear . " He jerked his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his ear . Peering closer , she decided it might not be a part of his body , but a part of that thing in his ear . But she was taking no chances . " Nay . It might bite me . " " Bite you ? I have landed in a looney bin . No , bite me ! " he said with chagrin . If his hands were free , he would probably be tearing at his hair as her father had been wont to do on occasion when exasperated with her . She guessed she knew what his expression meant . ' T was like Askil the Angry used to say " Eat my nose ! " when he was especially angry . " Bite me ? Is that another of your ridiculous sayings ? " She raised her chin haughtily and said something she never in her old life would have dared say , " Nay , I will not bite you . Bite me ! " She felt herself blush like a young maid . His brown eyes-and , yes , she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were brown as clover honey-almost bulged with astonishment . She was astonished herself and wished she could take the words back , especially since she belatedly suspected a different meaning to those words . But she was ne'er one to back down once she 'd taken a stand . " You are priceless , sweetheart , " he said and began to laugh ... and laugh ... and laugh . " Mayhap I will kill you after all , " she said . The brute continued to laugh . ( Continues ... ) by Sandra Hill
