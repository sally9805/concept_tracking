Eric ! " I shouted from under the table . " Yo ! " he answered cheerfully , close by . " Did n't I tell you to use linseed oil on this one ? " " I did . " I pushed myself out from under and stood up , brushing the grit from my hands onto my jeans . " Not on the back of the legs , you did n't . " " I thought I did , " he said , beginning to hedge . I 'd been working hard and I was tired . Fighting an inclination to snap , I reminded myself that Eric was only nineteen , basically untrained but willing to learn , reliable , mostly honest , and pleasant to be around -- overall , a much-better-than-average employee . I smiled a little , hoping to blunt the force of my next comments . " I just looked at it , Eric . You missed the backside of all four legs . Everyone considering bidding on this table will know its quality . And if they 're willing and able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will damn sure get down on their hands and knees and examine it closely . " He began to look embarrassed . The Mission-style table dated from the early twentieth century and featured select quarter-sawn oak finished in a warm brown . When properly oiled , the finish became lush and supple . It was a beautiful piece . " The problem with poor-qualitywork , " I continued , " is that it creates a negative image for the firm , implying that we 're lazy or sloppy . People may even think we 're sleazy . For instance , potential buyers might figure that we slapped some oil on the table as a quick fix , to disguise its previous ill-treatment . Does that make sense ? " " Yeah , " he said , grinning sheepishly . " Sorry . I was in a hurry . " " Do n't be . I pay you by the hour -- you do n't need to be in a hurry with a job like this . " " Got it . " I nodded and smiled again , sincerely this time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good thing most of the time -- you know me , I hate slow . " " Do n't I know it , " he responded , grinning back . " Josie ! " Gretchen called , her voice echoing in the cavernous warehouse . " Josie ? Where are you ? " " Here , in the Wilson corner ! " I answered , projecting my voice , referring to a roped-off area near the back where the Wilson estate 's goods were being catalogued and readied for Friday 's auction preview . " There 's a police officer to see you . " " What ? " I called back to her , startled . " A police chief , " she answered , as if that helped to clarify the situation . Leaving Eric at the table , I walked quickly toward the front , my unpolished engineer boots click-clacking on the concrete . I spotted a tall , broad-shouldered man , somewhere near forty , with dark , pockmarked skin and graying hair , waiting by the door that led from the warehouse to the entryway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The last time a cop had asked to see me , it had damn near ruined my life . Gretchen , my assistant , stood beside him , her copper-colored hair falling in cascades below her shoulders . Her green eyes were big with news , and her flawless ivory skin showed a slight flush . " Hi , " I said to the man as I approached . " I 'm Josie Prescott . " " I 'm Chief Alverez . Is there somewhere we can talk ? " " Sure , " I answered , my internal trouble spotter whirring into high alert . " What 's going on ? " " I 'm the chief of Rocky Point , " he told me , flipping open a worn leather case , showing me his badge . Rocky Point , a city of about hundred thousand , included almost three miles of New Hampshire 's eighteen-mile coastline about ten miles south of Portsmouth . " Chief of police ? " I queried . " What 's up ? " " I have a few questions about a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we talked in private . " " Sure . . . Gretchen , " I said , turning to her , " you can go back to work . " She left , and I moved away from the door toward some used , oversized crates stacked like bricks in a corner of the warehouse near the office door . " Is this all right ? " " Sure . " From where I stood , I could see the entire warehouse , stocked with furnishings of various types , periods , and quality . To unknowing eyes it probably looked chaotic , but I knew better ; it was a production line in perfect working order . Items came in for sorting ; the good stuff got primped and primed and sent to auction , usually in-house ; the junk , with a good piece or two thrown in to entice the faithful , was left in " as-is " condition for our weekly tag sale . Right now the warehouse was about half-full , and half-full was good . We were busy , and growing . " Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going on ? " " I understand you knew Nathaniel Grant . " It sounded more like an accusation than a question . " ' Knew ' him ? " I responded . " Did you ? " " ' Did ' I ? Are you saying . . . Is he . . . What are you saying ? " " You have n't heard the news ? " " What news ? " " Where have you been this morning ? " In a nanosecond , I went from confused and slightly impatient to angry and rebellious . Tired of playing cat-and-mouse , I got mad , almost like a switch had been thrown . I stood still and stayed silent , eyeing him , waiting for information . " Answer my question , please , " he said quietly after a pause , his calm contrasting with my agitation . " Where were you this morning ? " Words my father used to speak heading into a difficult business meeting came to mind : the best defense is a good offense . " Not another word will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer my question about what 's going on . " Alverez took a step closer to me . He was probably a foot taller than I was , which made him six one or better , and I suspected that he was using his height and bulk to try to intimidate me . It was working . I felt my palms become moist . I was shaking , but not enough , I hoped , for him to notice . " Nathaniel Grant was murdered this morning , " Alverez said . I stared at him . " Mr. Grant was murdered ? " I asked . " Yes , " he answered , watching me . Tears came to my eyes . I swallowed and brushed them away . " Oh , my God ! Poor Mr. Grant ! " I exclaimed . " What happened ? " " I 'm hoping you can help me sort that out . " I turned away , tears spilling down my cheeks . I could n't speak . " Seems like you knew him pretty well , " Alverez said . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of my hand to dry my cheeks . I 'd always felt things deeply , but I used to be good at controlling my emotional displays . I could hear my father saying , Feel all you want , Josie , but show nothing . In business , the more you show , the more you lose . When I 'd worked at Frisco 's , the big auction house in New York City , before I 'd been the prosecutor 's star witness at my boss 's price-fixing trial , I 'd shown nothing . It was n't the trial that got to me , although it was grueling ; it was my co-workers ' reaction to my involvement that stunned me speechless . Once my participation was known , colleagues whom I 'd previously trusted would n't give me the time of day . I was shunned , and within weeks , I was forced out of the company . And then , a month later , my father died , and it was as if the world tilted , leaving me utterly off balance . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't there yet . To say that I found it harder to contain my feelings did n't even begin to describe my lack of emotional control . It was as if my nerve endings were a little nearer to the surface . I shook my head a bit to chase the memory away . I took a deep breath and looked up at Alverez , trying for a smile . " I 'm being stupid , I know , " I said . " I did n't know Mr. Grant , not really . I only met him a couple of weeks ago . And look at me . " I swept away more tears . " It 's just such a shock . And he was such a sweetheart . " " Tell me about him , " Alverez said , leaning against the concrete wall . I paused , thinking of what to say . " He looked like Santa Claus , except that he was short and sort of shriveled . But he had the beard and the belly and he was jolly as all get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " He wanted to sell a lot of furniture and art . " " Out of the blue ? " I swallowed again , fighting back sudden emotion . " Not really . His wife died , you know , about three months ago . The house is huge . Well , I suppose you know that . It was too much for him , I guess . " " So , " Alverez said softly , " where were you this morning ? " " Is that when . . . I mean . . . when was he killed ? " " The medical examiner is still working on it . " I nodded . " I just ca n't believe it . Mr. Grant ! I 'm sorry . . . Okay . . . Let me think . " I sighed and paused . " Okay . I got in around eight and was here working , " I said , gesturing with a sweep of my hand that I meant inside the warehouse , " until around eleven-ten or eleven-fifteen . Then I drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around eleven-thirty . We had an appointment , but he was n't there . " " How do you know he was n't there ? " " I knocked and rang the bell . I went around back and knocked on the kitchen door . I even peeked in windows , but I did n't see anything . " " What did you do then ? " " I thought Mr. Grant had mistaken the day . He 's pretty old . " Alverez nodded . " So then what ? " I shrugged . " I sat in my car awhile . At quarter to twelve I rang the bell again , in case he had n't heard it the first time . Then I left a message on his answering machine and came back here . " I wiped away another tear . " I was planning on calling him again later today because I was n't sure he knew how to use his answering machine . " I smiled a little . " He was such a nice man . What happened ? " " We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know anything . " " Sure you do . You knew him and you were there this morning . What would be best is if you came with me to the station . " " Why ? " I asked , startled , and immediately wary . " To answer some more questions . " " I ca n't . I have too much work . " " I 'm afraid I 'm going to have to insist . It 's important . And I could really use your help . " I looked at him , wondering what I should do . The Wilson estate needed careful sorting , and there were only two days until the auction preview . Sasha , an **30;669;TOOLONG who worked for me , could handle that , I supposed . I 'd remind Eric to be diligent . Or maybe not . I 'd made my point earlier . Gretchen would hold the fort as she always did . " I guess , " I said . " I 'd better call my lawyer . " " Why do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he suggested . " I 'll let him decide . " " Who 's your lawyer ? " I worked with lawyers in my business all the time , but I 'd never needed one personally before . I swallowed , trying to focus . Who should I call ? Max Bixby came to mind . He was one of the first people I 'd met when I 'd moved to Portsmouth . I remembered his friendly welcome at a Chamber of Commerce breakfast , and he 'd been pleasant and accessible ever since . " I 'm going to call Max Bixby , " I said . " He 's a good man . " I turned away , heading for the office to talk to Gretchen . Before I reached the door , I stopped and turned back to him . He had n't moved . His eyes were dark and knowing . " May I ask you something ? " " Sure . Whether I answer , well , that depends . " I nodded . Tears came again , unexpected and unwanted . I turned away and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked quietly . He shook his head . " That 's under investigation . " I shut my eyes and shook my head . " Was he in the house ? " " Yes . " " Alone ? " " Yes . " " This morning ? " " Probably . " I shivered . Murdered and left alone to die in his own home . After trying his office , I reached Max at home . I could hear a child crying in the background and a woman 's raised voice . " I 'm sorry to disturb you at home , " I said . " It 's okay , Josie . I 'm glad to have an excuse to remove myself from the situation , " he said with a laugh . " What started as a nice family lunch has disintegrated into a temper tantrum . " " Well , I hate calling you there , but I think I 'm in trouble , Max , " I said , getting to the point . " Tell me , " he ordered , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good you called , " he said when I 'd finished . " I 'll meet you at the station house in a half hour . Wait for me in the parking lot . " I found Alverez where I 'd left him , standing by the crates , scanning the room . I told him what Max said , and he nodded . " Half hour 's fine , " he said . " I 'll see you there . " I watched as he walked away , leaving me feeling alone , confused , and frightened . Max and I stood on the edge of the sand dunes watching the ocean as we spoke . I know that it 's popular not to like lawyers , but it 's impossible not to like Max . He 's paternal without being patronizing , direct but always respectful , and old-fashioned without being stodgy . He 's probably about forty-five , but you think he 's older from the way he dresses and conducts himself . He wears tweed jackets and bow ties , and he 's almost courtly in manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-word answer ? What if he asks for my impressions of something ? " " Assuming I do n't stop you , try to answer it in one short sentence . Do n't expound . " I nodded my understanding and agreement . The ocean was rough today . The bottle green water was dotted with whitecaps , and the waves were bigger than usual . It was mostly overcast . A storm was brewing . Max told me his fee and I was glad that I had enough in savings so it would n't pinch to pay it . We crossed the street and entered the station house . The Rocky Point police station was new , built in the last year or two and designed to look like a beach house with a peaked roof and shingles left to weather to a silvery tone just like most of the houses along the shore . Alverez pushed through the swinging wooden gate to greet us , then held it open for us to pass through . " Thanks for coming . How you doing , Max ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How 've you been ? I have n't seen you since last summer 's clam bake . " " That was a good time , was n't it ? " Alverez asked . " Cathy , " he called , " we 'll be in the back . " A big blonde hurried out from somewhere on the left . " Did you see my notes ? " she asked . " You had calls . " She scooped up old-fashioned pink While You Were Out message sheets from a Formica-topped desk and handed them to him , spotted us , and looked at Alverez , a question in her eyes . " This is Josie Prescott , " Alverez said to her . " And her lawyer , Max Bixby . We 'll be in room two , Cathy . " To me he added , " Would you like some coffee or an iced tea or anything ? " " No , thanks , " I said . " You ? " he asked Max . " I 'm fine , thanks . " He led us down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire-mesh cage partitioned in a corner . " That 's creepy , " I said , nodding toward it . " Yeah . But necessary sometimes for our unruly guests . " " I guess , " I said . " Have a seat . I wo n't be long . " I sat so the holding cell was in back of me , out of sight . The chair was hard and uncomfortable . Max sat across from me and pulled a yellow legal pad from his briefcase . I leaned forward , resting my eyes on the heels of my hands , my elbows perched on the scarred wooden table . Max did n't speak , but I could hear him turning pages on his pad . Unexpectedly , the door latch clicked home with a sharp snap . I looked up , startled by the sound , feeling as trapped as if I 'd been locked in the cage behind me . Without a watch , which I never wore since it always seemed to get in the way when I was working , I had no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed a very long time , but I felt a sense of unreality , so maybe it was n't long at all . " Sorry to keep you waiting , " Alverez said when he came back , businesslike , carrying a collection of papers . " I have the medical examiner 's preliminary report . Before I tell you about it , though , let me get the recorder set up . " " Recorder ? " I asked . " Tape recorder . So I do n't have to take notes . " I looked at Max and he nodded . " That 's fine . I 'm assuming we can have a copy of the tape ? " Max asked . " Sure , " Alverez said . I watched as Alverez positioned the small unit on the table and pushed a button . A red light appeared and I heard a whirring sound . Alverez gave our names , the date , and time . " I appreciate your coming in to help , " Alverez said . " Just a formality , but I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been advised of your rights . " Alverez slid a piece of paper across the table to Max and read me my Miranda rights . It felt hard to breathe . I forced myself to listen , and when he asked me if I understood , I answered that I did . Max nodded that it was okay for me to sign the paper . Never sign something you have n't read , my dad had taught me . I read it and signed my name . " Okay , " Alverez said . " So . The medical examiner . The preliminary report is in . " " What did he say ? " Max asked . " She . Dr. Young said death occurred this morning . " " When ? " " Between nine and noon , as best she can figure it . " " Oh , my God ! " I exclaimed . " I had a horrible thought before that it was while I was on the porch that he was dying , and now you 're saying it 's true ! " Tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Max patted my arm gently , and whispered , " Do n't speak . " " I had an officer check things out , " Alverez said , looking at me , changing the subject . " We found your appointment in Mr. Grant 's diary . It lay open to today 's date on the kitchen table . Apparently , he had n't forgotten that you were to meet him . " I shook my head . " Poor Mr. Grant . " " And your message was still on the machine -- apparently unplayed . " " How did death occur ? " Max asked . " What about it , Josie ? Do you know ? " " What ? " I asked , horrified as the implications of his question sunk in . He thought I knew something about Mr. Grant 's murder . " Do you know how Mr. Grant died ? " he asked again . " No . Of course not . " " Well ? " Max prompted , tapping his pen on the table . " Fill us in . " " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I exclaimed , and began to cry again . " How awful . " I used the sides of my hands and pushed gently under my eyes . The tears gradually stopped . Struck by a sudden thought , I turned to Max and in a soft voice asked , " I just thought of something . How did they know he 'd been killed ? " Max nodded and repeated the question . Alverez leaned back in his chair , balancing for a moment on the back two legs , keeping his eyes on mine . " His daughter called from Massachusetts and asked us to check on him . " " She did ? " I asked , looking from Alverez to Max and back again . " I do n't understand . Why ? " " She got a call from his lawyer , Epps his name is . Mr. Epps was concerned that someone was trying to strong-arm Mr. Grant into selling his treasures for a song . The daughter , hearing this , was , of course , concerned , and immediately started calling him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were on the answering machine , too . She called a neighbor , but the neighbor was n't home . She called both her dad and the neighbor a few more times with no luck . So finally she called us . " " Someone trying to strong-arm Mr. Grant ! That 's terrible ! Who would do such a thing ? Did the lawyer give a name ? " " Yeah , he did . He told Grant 's daughter that it was a shark named Josie Prescott . " Continues ...
