<p> In English or Spanish : Responses to " We 're in U.S. , so keep newspaper in English , " Letters , Sept. 9 <p> Note the benefits of other languages <p> The letter writer who objected to finding Spanish-language references in recent AJC crossword puzzles should be careful of the restrictions she 's suggesting for puzzle designers . For where would crossword designers  --  and , therefore , crossword solvers  --  be without foreign-language answers , such as nyet , rara , et alii , etc. , not to mention the names of people and places from outside the United States ? <p> May I suggest that , instead of singling out just the Spanish words , she notice all of the clues and answers that puzzle designers borrow  --  from many languages  --  to construct crosswords that many enjoy ? If she does , she may also notice how it has increased her vocabulary . <p> SARAH NOCK , Marietta <p> The advantages discount opposition <p> Is there something inherently evil in educated English speakers being fluent in other languages ? If not , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the way , clues in French appear occasionally as well , though they do not seem to trigger a hissy fit . <p> Ciao , bambina . <p> EMILIA NAVARRO , Atlanta <p> Learn new things <p> What 's the fun of doing a crossword if you do n't learn something new ? Putting a Spanish word or two in the list is a painless and interesting way to get a glimpse of another language . Keep it up . <p> CAROL CRAWFORD , Blue Ridge <p> Puzzle lovers want well-rounded clues <p> A letter writer recently took The Atlanta Journal-Constitution to task for printing crossword puzzles with clues in Spanish . Her contention seemed to be that the AJC was catering to the local Hispanic community . <p> To her I would say this : Crossword puzzles are , among other things , a test of one 's well-roundedness . Exposure to foreign languages is part of being well-rounded . <p> Puzzles contain clues requiring the ability to at least make an educated guess about words in ( among possible others ) Spanish , French , Italian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judging from my experience . People who enjoy crossword puzzles enjoy these sorts of clues . To exclude them would make the puzzles less interesting . <p> If the letter writer does n't like the puzzles as they are , she should switch to Sudoku and quit trying to spoil things for the rest of us . <p> DAVID NUGENT , Canton <p> A little cultural enlightenment helps <p> I fail to understand the problem with a crossword puzzle containing clues in Spanish . <p> I work the puzzle regularly and have found clues requiring knowledge of German , French and even Latin . Why the uproar over Spanish ? <p> Oh , right , there is no cultural paranoia about immigrants from a dead empire . <p> CAROLINE KNIGHT , Atlanta <p> Racial , religious tolerance <p> Points to ponder for Kappa Alpha adviser <p> The AJC published a rebuttal to an AJC editorial by Mark Cross , Kappa Alpha 's chapter adviser at the University of Georgia ( " Kappa Alpha housing plan will strengthen neighborhood , " Equal Time , Sept. 6 ) . Within days of Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white fraternity , Chi Phi , for flashing pictures of naked black women to passers-by . <p> I am in no way saying that all white fraternities are alike , but could this be one of the reasons that the residents of the historically black community in Athens object to the Kappa Alpha land purchase and its plans to build a fraternity house in their neighborhood ? <p> Showing pictures of nude women to nonparticipatory witnesses is bad enough , but why did the photos have to be of black women ? What message lies within that ? A question for Mark Cross to ponder . <p> DeANNA THOMAS , Jonesboro <p> Symbols of hatred should be avoided <p> As a white person who notices acts of racism against people of color , I was angered by some of the responses to Kappa Alpha 's plans to move into a black community . <p> There are symbols that cause great pain . Whether people agree it is a symbol of pain is irrelevant . Just as the Nazi swastika is offensive to most people , so is the Confederate battle flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plans rile neighbors , " Page One , Sept. 2 ) , the Rev. Ben Rivers was quoted as saying " To the white affluent , it 's nostalgia , " he said . For blacks , images of the Old South conjure " pain and abject poverty . " It 's not discrimination when it is a symbol of hatred . It 's plain hatred . <p> MIRANDA DILLARD , Atlanta <p> Rowdy parties also at issue <p> I have two observations about the controversy surrounding the plans of the Confederate-and-proud fraternity Kappa Alpha to build a frat house in a historically black district of downtown Athens . <p> First , as a white woman ( and a University of Georgia parent ) , I ask all white readers to put themselves in the place of those in the West Hancock community . <p> Without a doubt , I and all my neighbors would take great issue with having the fraternity in our neighborhood , so this is not just a black resistance issue . <p> Second , I ask the zoning commission to question why a club  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penchant for rowdy partying and disturbing the peace  --  would be appropriate in a housing zone . <p> The fact that UGA has stepped in to offer an alternative location closer to campus suggests that it acknowledges the realities of fraternity living and the public relations nightmare this could become if Kappa Alpha goes ahead with its plans . <p> CYNTHIA DAVIS , Atlanta <p> Public prayers do n't have to be offensive <p> Cobb County commissioners want prayers that invoke the name of Jesus Christ ( Page One , Sept. 9 ) . The American Civil Liberties Union argued that such prayers were an " unconstitutional government endorsement of Christianity . " But what if public officials , clergy or simply family members exercised a little common sense ? <p> Why not just preface prayerful remarks this way : " These are difficult times , and I 'd like to say a few words that express my own faith , beliefs that help me get through hard times . I do not mean to speak for everyone here , but what I have to say is a comfort to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I bow my head and respect another 's beliefs . <p> If leaders rotate such opening remarks in a way that would allow for diverse individual faiths to be expressed , again I would take no offense . <p> MARTIN LAMMON , Milledgeville <p> Consider others ' feelings when setting rules <p> Three items published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Sept. 9 left me wishing that more of us had the ability to put ourselves in other people 's shoes . <p> First , a letter ( " Blacks want it all , to no one 's surprise , " Saturday Talk ) criticizes African-Americans who " object to Southerners wearing Confederate uniforms . " Let 's just think rationally : Why might they object ? <p> Second , a front-page article ( " Prayers to Jesus OK 'd for Cobb commission " ) reports that a federal judge 's ruling allows the use of prayers mentioning Jesus  --  the same Jesus who asked us to care for the stranger , the prisoner and the poor , but in whose name we in the West carried out the Crusades and imperialism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an American Muslim scholar ( " Education is key to views on Islam " ) reports on growing numbers of Americans who would favor restrictions on Muslim citizens . Have we forgotten the Bill of Rights ? Or our mistakes of the past  --  " legal " restrictions on a multitude of groups ? <p> HELEN SMITH , Atlanta <p> The forces against change hurt areas <p> We were Atlanta residents for 50-plus years . For six years now , Athens has been our home . We visit Atlanta and enjoy the changes . The Beltline seemed to be the next step of a " great " city . <p> But it seems there is a strong resistance to change . And coupled with homeownership , change seems to be viscerally taken as life threatening . Such is the case in northeast Atlanta , where Beltline debate rages over the level of density . <p> Similarly , a recently proposed four-story medical office on Prince Avenue in Athens was described as a " skyscraper , " casting its shadow over the neighborhood and threatening to bring all traffic to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grasp a less parochial understanding of their relationship with their living environment . <p> CARY MERLIN , Athens <p> Panda coverage is educational <p> Thank you so much for the continuing story on Lun Lun and her new cub . <p> My 8-year-old son went to Zoo Atlanta over the summer and is excited to see the stories about Lun Lun and her new baby . What a wonderful educational experience for kids , and it gives all of us something positive to follow up on . <p> Please keep the panda updates on the front page , and keep up the good work . <p> SHERYL PRY , Eatonton <p> War on terrorism <p> ' Impeach ' should cross minds in Congress <p> It appears that President Bush ignored the information provided by his intelligence agencies and made up a story that fit the course of action he wanted to take in Iraq ( " Iraq 's terror link in doubt , " Page One , Sept. 9 ) . In short , he deliberately lied to Congress and the American people . <p> If Congress could draw up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a minor sexual escapade , what are we to do about a president who deliberately lies to take the nation into war ? <p> MICHAEL GOODMAN , Cumming <p> Leaders ignore financial , social , human costs <p> White House spokesman Tony Snow , in response to the Senate Intelligence Committee 's findings of no link between Saddam Hussein 's regime and al-Qaida , said , " We 'll let people quibble over three years ago . " <p> The remark by Snow is a blatant admission that the reports are correct and , in fact , old news . This contradicts the fact that Iraq was an imminent threat to the United States and the center for the fight against terror . <p> I do n't think those who view the Senate report as significant are " quibbling " over mere semantics , but rather over the tens of thousands of civilian deaths , the thousands of dead American troops and the ungodly sums of taxpayer money and resources diverted to the war effort  --  not to mention the loss of face in the world community . <p> TRAVIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary Tony Snow fields questions from reporters Wednesday during a daily briefing in the White House .
