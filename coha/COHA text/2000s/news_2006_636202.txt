<p> Once upon a time , composer/lyricist Stephen Sondheim joined forces with playwright/director James Lapine to create " Into the Woods , " a musical revision of familiar fairy tales such as " Cinderella " and " Jack and the Beanstalk " not only retelling those stories but following the characters beyond the " happily ever after " endings to see if their fates were bright , indeed . <p> A new production of the Tony Award-winning show runs through Nov. 26 at the Marriott Lincolnshire Theater ( www.marriotttheatre.com , 847-634-0200 ) . <p> mdavenport@suntimes.com <p> SUSAN MONIZ <p> THE WITCH <p> Literary or cinematic inspiration for her character ? : I do n't have one set character that I base her on . ... Sometimes I think of Witch Hazel from Bugs Bunny , though . <p> Favorite fairy tale growing up : Danny Kaye 's " The Ugly Duckling . " I loved that version of that story . I would watch it every time it was on . <p> Fairy tale for which she 'd like to know what happens " happily ever after " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the raw end of the deal . It 's the king who is threatening the girl with death if she does n't work this impossible miracle . He should be the one to suffer , not Rumpelstiltskin . <p> What her character would be doing today in the real world today : She would n't be associating with anybody . She 'd be that woman who lives in the one broken-down house that no one will go near because everyone thinks it 's haunted . Maybe she sells items on eBay for a living so she does n't have to talk to anybody . <p> PATRAICK ANDREWS <p> JACK <p> Literary or cinematic inspiration for his character ? : I researched the fables . Jack and the Beanstalk ca n't be pulled from one source . In earlier versions , he was avenging his father 's death and was very moral . In later stories , it was all about grabbing the gold and gaining status . Lupine and Sondheim made him very wide-eyed , wonder-filled boy who is sort of slow and does n't have a friend other than his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved Sleeping Beauty , especially the Disney movie . I would perform it and play all the parts . My favorite character was probably Maleficent because of her great cape . <p> Fairy tale for which he 'd like to know what happens " happily ever after " : The Twelve Dancing Princesses by the Brothers Grimm . They all seem to be enjoying life instead of being crammed into a castle waiting for one guy to rescue them . Then this guy comes along , spoils their plan and marries the older sister . I always wondered what the other sisters did . If it had been me , I 'd be pissed . Can you imagine the castle at the holidays ? Eleven angry women against one man . <p> One fairytale moment in his life : It 's a tie : The first time I started on my path toward my dream of being a professional actor , and on a personal note the first time I ever locked eyes with that special someone and realized it was mutual . Wow , that 's so beautiful , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't believe I said that . <p> ABBY MUELLER <p> CINDERELLA <p> Literary or cinematic inspiration for her character : That 's been the source of most of the pressure . My character is so well-known , what I have tried to go for is the thing that 's constant : her kindness , and she 's a friend to animals . She 's had a horrible upbringing , but she still remains nice . <p> Fairy tale for which she 'd like to know what happens " happily ever after " : All of them . If there is one thing this show has convinced me it that there is probably something interesting that happens " happily every after " in all fairy tales . " Happily every after " is so vague , anything could happen . That 's what makes this show cool . <p> What her character would be doing in the real world today : She 'd be working at the Anti-Cruelty Society or volunteering to help homeless animals find loving homes . <p> BRANDY MCLENDON <p> LITTLE RED RIDINGHOOD <p> Favorite fairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grimm . I like the lesson that you ca n't judge a book by the cover . <p> What her character would be doing in the real world today : I imagine her as kind of a Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the school 's valedictorian . <p> One fairytale moment in her life : My husband and I met in a voice-over acting class . It was one of those frog prince , **31;3047;TOOLONG moments . I 'm from Texas and he declared at the start of class he was going to do a Texas accent , and I thought he was a jerk because no one ever does a Texas accent right . And then he nailed it . <p> MICHAEL LINDNER <p> THE BAKER <p> Fairy tale for which he 'd like to know what happens " happily ever after " : I would like to know what happened to the Seven Dwarves afterward . Maybe they got into some horrible mining accident and formed the first miners union . <p> What his character would be doing in the real world today : Thanks to the low-carb craze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be some sort of skilled laborer , maybe an auto mechanic or he owns a dry cleaners . <p> One wish that has come true : When I was a little kid , I wanted a swimming pool and my dad went out and bought an above-ground swimming pool . <p> One wish that he regrets came true : Actually , the swimming pool . After the water got covered in a slimy green algae , I never wanted to swim in it . <p> SUSIE MCMONAGLE <p> THE BAKER 'S WIFE <p> Favorite fairy tale growing up : " Hansel and Gretel . " Of course , part of it is the candy house . The other part is I have an older brother and I always liked how Hansel is the one who is scared and it 's Gretel who saves the day . I always wanted to be the one who saves the day . <p> Fairy tale for which she 'd like to know what happens " happily ever after " : " Hansel and Gretel . " I always wondered if they ever went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairytale children whose mothers have died and they all live in the candy house . <p> What her character would be doing in the real world today ? : She 'd probably be one of the " Desperate Housewives . " My character 's name is " the Baker 's Wife . " She does n't have her own name or identity beyond that . And while I hope things would be different today , I know they probably would n't be . <p> One fairytale moment in her life : This is going to sound so selfish , but wishes are inherently selfish ... I wanted to be able to walk through the stage door on Broadway . All those years in New York as a waitress , I would watch actresses walk through stage doors with their coffee and their gym bags . Finally , when I was rehearsing the role of Fantine in " Les Miserables , " it hit me . I was the one walking into the theater . I will never forget how great and special this is . I will never take this for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAYMOND MASSEY , SAM 'S HERE <p> Sam Waterston , best known as prosecutor Jack McCoy on the NBC series " Law &; Order , " was honored Wednesday by the New York State Archives Partnership Trust for his long run in another role : President Abraham Lincoln . <p> Waterston ( below ) , who has portrayed Honest Abe on stage , TV , film and in public readings , told the Albany Times Union that he got his first Lincoln role almost 20 years ago because he was " tall , thin and ugly . " <p> He received the 2006 Empire State Archives and History Award for his work highlighting the importance of history . The New York State Archives , a program of the State Education Dept. , has more than 130 million historical documents . <p> AP <p> DETROIT CONTRACT TALKS AT INTERMISSION <p> Members of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra have agreed to extend their labor contract for a year with the same salaries and benefits . Talks will resume later this fall . The minimum salary remains $1,900 per week or $98,800 per season , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musicians took pay cuts to help reduce the orchestra 's $2 million deficit ; in return , they received pay raises last season . AP <p> KOREAN WOMAN WINS SOLTI COMPETITION <p> Shi-Yeon Sung of South Korea has won the Sir Georg Solti International Conductors Competition in Frankfurt , Germany .

So the latest show there is practically a revolution . This weekend , the Grand Palais began paying homage to Walt Disney  --  seriously , academically and without a trace of disdain for American pop culture . The show , " Once Upon a Time , Walt Disney , " is n't G-rated , and runs through Jan. 15 . <p> BIGGEST APPLAUSE ON GREAT WHITE WAY <p> The biggest draws currently on Broadway : <p> 1 .
