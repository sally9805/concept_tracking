<p> The Republican presidential candidates came here yesterday  --  to the state with the highest unemployment rate in the nation  --  for a debate on the economy . If there is a better place than Dearborn to talk about Americans ' economic anxiety , it 's not obvious . <p> Sure enough , Maria Bartiromo of CNBC began the debate by mentioning a recent poll in which two-thirds of Americans said the economy was either in a recession or headed toward one . She then asked Fred Thompson , the center of everyone 's attention because this was his first debate , whether he agreed . <p> " I think there is no reason to believe that we 're headed for a recession , " Mr. Thompson said , before ticking off a list of good news : 22 straight quarters of economic growth , low inflation , low unemployment , a rising stock market . <p> Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney , the other two candidates atop the Iowa and New Hampshire polls , offered a similarly upbeat message . Mr. Romney mentioned Michigan 's " one-state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regain voters ' trust on the economy , they had to avoid doom and gloom . When Mr. Giuliani was asked about the billions of dollars being made by private equity firms , he replied , " Well , I mean , the market is a wonderful thing . " Thanks to the free market , he added , " the sky 's the limit . " <p> After losing the midterm elections last year , the Republicans had a chance to recalibrate their sunny economic picture they have been offering since 2002 . It now seems clear that they 're not going to do so . They are going to run on the same economic themes they have been running on ( if not always governing by ) for decades : low taxes , fiscal discipline , less regulation , free trade . They 're still going to cast government  --  not globalization , not technological change or anything else in the private sector  --  as the main problem . <p> It 's just as clear that Democrats think that the political game has changed . Pay for most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the last five years , and except for the late 1990s has n't really done well since the early 1970s . Inequality has returned to the levels of the 1920s . <p> " It 's an economy that demands more from our workers and gives less in return , " Hillary Clinton said in Iowa this week , on her Middle Class Express bus tour . As Charles Schumer , New York 's other senator , told me earlier this year : " In the past , the attitude was , ' Get government out of the way . ' And now it 's , ' Gee , I may need it . ' " <p> I have no idea which party 's reading of the national mood will turn out to be right because there is a pretty good argument to be made on either side . <p> As the Republicans well know , populism has n't been a winning political strategy in this country for a long time . And the current state of the economy is hardly miserable . Wages for rank-and-file workers may be growing slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the most recent CBS News poll , 50 percent of respondents said the economy was very good or fairly good , while 47 percent said it was very bad or fairly bad . <p> But as Ms. Bartiromo 's opening question suggested , a lot of Americans also think that the situation is getting worse . People are clearly nervous about the future . <p> A few Republicans did talk about this anxiety in Michigan yesterday , but not the ones likely to be accepting the nomination next summer . There is a useful way , in fact , to distinguish between the front-running Republicans and those at the back of the primary pack . Just listen to how upbeat they are about the economy . <p> Representative Ron Paul , the libertarian doctor from Texas whose poll numbers are far down in the single digits , said during this first answer that " this country is in the middle of a recession for a lot of people . " Mike Huckabee , the former governor of Arkansas , even resorted to what many Republicans would call class warfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now making 500 times as much as the typical worker . <p> " Most of us here today , probably every one of us , are living better than we ever dreamed we would when we were kids , " Mr. Huckabee said . " But when I ask the question how many of you think your kids and grandkids are going to be living better than you , rarely does a hand go up . " <p> Somewhere between Mr. Huckabee and the three front-runners  --  Mr. Giuliani , Mr. Romney and Mr. Thompson  --  is John McCain , who 's trying to claw his way back into the top tier of candidates . He seems to have decided that the front-runners ' upbeat message has given him an opening . <p> Before the debate , Mr. McCain gave a breakfast speech at a Marriott in downtown Detroit that contained the outlines of what could be a Republican response to middle-class anxiety . " Globalization is here , globalization is an opportunity , but globalization will not automatically benefit every American , " Mr. McCain said . <p> Besides tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhaul of unemployment benefits and retraining programs so that they would better serve people out of work for long periods . He also talked about introducing more competition into the public school system , and he promised to unveil a health care plan . It 's hardly a complete program at this point , but it has a unifying theme : a middle ground between tax cutting and big new government programs . <p> " We 're no longer running as a party to eliminate government , " Douglas Holtz-Eakin , a McCain adviser and former head of the Congressional Budget Office , told me . " But we have n't been coherent on how we want to use it . " <p> If the McCain campaign starts to catch fire  --  or if the economy takes a turn for the worse  --  you could imagine that the other Republicans would change their economic tune . Mr. Romney , for instance , might spend more time talking about his plan to exempt everyone making less than $200,000 from paying taxes on their investments , an idea he did n't even mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economic debate of the 2008 presidential campaign will probably not turn on who the nominees are . Instead , the campaign will be a contest between one party that thinks Ronald Reagan 's strategy still works and another that thinks the Reagan playbook is finally outdated. ##
