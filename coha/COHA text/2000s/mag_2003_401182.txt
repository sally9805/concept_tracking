Having a cold sucks . On top of the red nose and lung-busting cough , you 're cooped up and bored to tears . Here 's how to stay busy till your meds kick in. // 1 Do some creative accounting and add up all the money you 're saving by being housebound . Take all the details into consideration , like no dinners out , no $3 lattes ... hell , you 're not even putting gas in your car ! Then come up with a million ways to spend all that " found " loot. 2 Since : your sleep schedule is totally mangled ( afternoon naps are a necessity , but damn if they do n't make you stay up all night ) , check out what really goes on during all those mysterious hours you never experience . For instance , sunrise ? They say it 's beautiful , but have you ever actually seen it ? ( When you 're not doing a walk of shame , that is. ) 3 Ditch your ratty flannel pj 's and , instead , lounge dramatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for special-occasion hookups. 4 Put your makeup to the ultimate test : See if you can beautify your puffy , red , raw , blotchy face . Does your concealer have what it takes to cover that Rudolph nose ? Will mascara really open up those slits that used to be your eyes ? 5 Rummage through the back of the closet , dig out all of your " skinny " pants , and have a fashion show for yourself in front of a full-length mirror . You 've had a week or so with no appetite or sense of smell or taste-work it , baby ! 6 Enjoy the rain-forest properties of your bathroom postshower-seal yourself in with the steam and breathe deep for the first time in days . 7 Conduct your annual soap-opera catch-up-luckily , even though you have n't seriously tuned in since high school , picking up the plotlines is no problem : same characters , same shenanigans , same dead twin returning from the grave . 8 Pull out your phone book and call everyone you know , starting with A and making your way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had enough spare hours to catch up with the whole gang from the fast-food joint where you worked freshman year ? 9 Take advantage of your total isolation from all human contact and do those at-home beauty treatments that are too time-consuming and messy to ever embark on during normal life-an avocado face mask , mayo in the hair all afternoon , soaking your cuticles in olive oil . 10 Guilt your mom or a friend into bringing you a slew of trashy , brain-candy movies and mags . Nobody expects any intellectual activity on your part right now , so indulge in fluff. 11 Rerecord your home and office answering-machine messages while your voice is all throaty , deep , and sexy . You can blow off changing it again when you 're back to normal . 12 Let the odd lightheaded , woozy-yet-heart-racing feeling you get from daytime cold pills inspire some creative new decorating ideas . Polka-dot curtains ... now that 's what your room needs . 13 Schedule a zillion dinners , drinks , movies , and dates for a week from now to get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends do n't totally forget that you exist . 14 Buy stuff online . You 're suffering , darling-you need a new purse ! And really , that 's what home computers are for . 15 Instead of a productive shower where you wash your hair and shave your legs , just lounge in a hot bath loaded up with bubbles for a long , long time-until your feet start to prune up . <p>
