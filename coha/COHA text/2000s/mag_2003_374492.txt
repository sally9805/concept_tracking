The first time anyone was rumored to have broached directly the subject of a nice , quiet exile for Saddam Hussein was back in August , when stories circulated that a member of the Qatari royal family had ventured to Baghdad to see whether there was some way to avert a war by offering Saddam a way out  --  perhaps a plush retirement in a place like Saudi Arabia , where deposed despot Idi Amin enjoys fishing and playing his accordion . In Arab press accounts , Saddam was said to have angrily sent the envoy packing , and since then both sides have denied that any such overture ever happened . Who , indeed , would dare mention such a fate for the Butcher of Baghdad ? <P> Lots of people , it turns out , as war pressures grow . The Saudis have now taken the initiative in putting together a deal that leaves the door open for Saddam to accept exile but meanwhile is aimed at encouraging his generals to oust him if he does n't . Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal has discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with President George W. Bush in Washington . Though Bush 's aides had already publicly embraced the option , the President for the first time came on board , declaring that should Saddam Hussein " choose to leave the country , along with a lot of the other henchmen who have tortured the Iraqi people , we would welcome that , of course ... The use of military troops is my last choice , not my first . " <P> It 's no wonder this scenario is growing in popularity as the deadline for war approaches . If Saddam were to accept exile , Iraq would be spared the devastation of war and America the risks and blame for it . Saudi Arabia would show the U.S. , still aggrieved by the fact that most of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi , how helpful it can be and would demonstrate to its own people its devotion to protecting a fellow Arab state from war . Arab leaders would avoid upheaval in a region where chaos has a way of spreading . The U.N . ' s resolve would be rewarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush would sacrifice some of the strategic and moral logic of his war on terrorism if he let Saddam walk away unaccountable , especially if Saddam continued to make mischief from afar . But whatever the risks of compromise , the risks of war may be greater , so the White House is n't likely to rule out some kind of deal . <P> Saddam is another story . A man who likens himself to Nebuchadnezzar and Saladin and who first killed someone as a teenager and has ruthlessly pursued power ever since probably wo n't simply quit now , say intelligence analysts . The analysts are virtually unanimous in their assessment that Saddam will not go standing up . For one thing , it 's his power that has kept him alive . Saddam sleeps in a different bed every night , has body doubles and food tasters , all for good reason . Iraqi diplomats say Saddam is convinced that Bush wants him dead , and so any exile scenario would have to assure him that he would never find himself in the sights of a Predator drone or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , says a French official , " it 's difficult to imagine Saddam throwing up his arms , saying ' All right , I 'll go , ' and agreeing to live a life of fear , distrust and , who knows , maybe betrayal , prison and humiliation in exile .
