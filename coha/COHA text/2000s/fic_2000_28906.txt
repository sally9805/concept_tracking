Rules of Surrender Chapter One England , 1839 Adorna Viscountess Ruskin , looked at the ornate lettering on the calling card in her gloved hand , then up at the tall limestone townhouse . In London 's overcast March sunlight , the place looked respectable , if slightly shabby , and while this neighborhood had been fashionable in the days of Adorna 's youth thirty years before , many of England 's best families still lived along this street . That information allowed her hope . Tucking the calling card into her pocketbook , she mounted the steps and rang the bell . At once the door opened . A butler stood there , a proper butler of the old school in a powdered wig and knee breeches . He summed her up in a single , comprehensive glance . His summation produced a bow so obsequious his corset creaked , and in an accent that was almost more upper class than young Queen Victoria 's , he said , " How may I help you , madam ? " " I am Viscountess Ruskin . " From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although whether for her wealth , her connections or her notoriety , she did n't know . Nor did she care . Adorna had long ago grown into her role as the most beautiful woman in England . Taking a step back to allow her entrance , he said , " My lady Ruskin , we at Miss Setterington 's Distinguished Academy of Governesses are honored . " As she stepped inside , she smiled at him with the admiration she showed every man , regardless of his rank or age . " And you are ? " A dark flush started beneath his cravat and dyed his cheeks and forehead , but his demeanor never changed . " I am Cusheon , my lady . " " Cusheon . What a lovely name . " The creaky old butler 's lips lifted ever so slightly . " Thank you , my lady . " " There 's that smile . I knew you had one . " Adorna enjoyed coaxing cheer out of the sourest puss . " Cusheon , I 've come to speak to the proprietors of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving boy ran forward to accept her hat and coat . With her thumb , she rubbed a smudge off his chin . " You look very much like my son at your age , " she said . " Right down to the flour . " " I 've been helping Cook with the baking , " the lad said . " Wynter used to do that , too , " she confirmed , and reluctantly let him go . So many changes had occurred in her life lately . Changes were good , of course . Of course they were . " Miss Hannah Setterington is currently assisting a countess , " Cusheon said , " but if you would allow me , I will see if they have concluded their business . " " Thank you . That is most acceptable . " While the butler made his stately way across the foyer , she assessed her surroundings . Although the tables were oldfashioned , everything here sparkled with polish and smelled of beeswax . Impressive . Very well tended . She relaxed infinitesimally . The butler rapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within , entered . He returned almost at once . " Miss Hannah Setterington and the countess have concluded their business . If my lady would come this way ? " As they neared the office , an elderly woman , stooped , heavily veiled and wrapped against March 's chill , stepped into the foyer on the arm of a tall woman . In a creaking voice , the countess said , " Miss Setterington , I am delighted with the companion you found me . You may be assured of my continued patronage . " This was Miss Setterington ? Startled , Adorna studied the young woman in black bombazine . She had n't expected the proprietress to be so lacking in years , yet Miss Setterington 's easy manner bespoke experience in dealing with the peevish and crotchety . Indeed , she patted the gloved hand on her arm as she handed the countess over to Cusheon . " Thank you , my lady . We are always anxious to be of service . " With a smile and a curtsy , she turned to Adorna . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , my lady . If you would come into the office . . . " Adorna studied the old woman as she hobbled past , then followed Miss Setterington into a well-appointed library . A fire burned in the fireplace , the Aubusson carpets were clean if well worn and oiled leather books filled the shelves . " I thought I knew every titled person in England , " Adorna said , " but I do n't remember that countess . " " Lady Temperly travels abroad extensively , " Miss Setterington answered . " That was why she had difficulty finding a companion . So many young people today want to stay only in England . " " Lady Temperly . " The name was familiar . " No , I do n't think I 've ever had the pleasure . " Although it seemed Adorna had recently heard gossip about her . But she did n't have time to worry about the elderly Lady Temperly . Her own personal crisis beckoned . Miss Setterington offered a chair set before a delicate walnut writing desk , and Adorna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-fashioned , well crafted and well tended , with a bottle of ink , a penknife and a pile of well-made pens . Files of every sort stood in stacks on its surface . As Miss Setterington rounded the desk to her chair , Adorna cocked her head to read the notations . Marchioness Winokur , proclaimed one . Baroness Rand , read another . The knowledge that she was not the first to utilize the Distinguished Academy for Governesses offered comfort . " I rely on your discretion , of course , Miss Setterington . " Miss Setterington seated herself in a delicate chair and reached for an empty file . " Of course , my lady . " " I need a governess . " When Miss Setterington would have spoken , Adorna held up her hand . " Not just any governess . I find myself in quite an unusual situation , and the woman I would hire must be of strong moral fiber and unyielding determination . " " That would be Lady Charlotte Dalrumple , " Miss Setterington replied instantly . Adorna studied Miss Setterington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , my lady , for my seemingly thoughtless reply , " Miss Setterington continued , " but if I were to espouse two phrases to describe Lady Charlotte Dalrumple , they would be the phrases you chose . I suspect you have heard of her through the success of her pupils . In the nine years she has been a governess , she has taken six incorrigible pupils and prepared them for their debuts . Surely you heard how young Lord Marchant wished only for dissipation and fought the necessity of taking his bow before the queen ? " " Oh , yes ! " Adorna had indeed heard the tale , and for the first time in two weeks , hope blossomed in her ...
