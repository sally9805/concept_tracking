They vary widely , but most eliminate caffeine , alcohol , sugar , processed foods and fast foods . Many exclude dairy , meat and wheat products . <p> The most stringent are liquid fasts . Some even recommend enemas , including coffee enemas . <p> In many cases , the diets are big business , often involving purchasing books , supplements , vitamins , shakes , drinks , teas , juicers and other products . <p> The plans are supposed to remove chemical and dietary toxins from the body . But weight-loss experts have long been skeptical about the claims , saying there is no scientific evidence such programs do a better job than the body 's own organs . They also say many of the plans are deficient in protein and other nutrients . <p> " These kinds of diets are not a reasonable approach to weight loss , and there is no data that they do what they claim , " says Gary Foster , director of the Center for Obesity Research and Education at Temple University in Philadelphia . He is concerned that the cleanses could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obesity , such as high blood pressure , diabetes and heart disease . <p> Joy Bauer , a registered dietitian in New York City , says : " People are always doing them , and it 's disheartening because they are sophisticated , smart people who know better , but they are so desperate for a quick fix . You do n't experience long-term success on them . You may be less bloated . You may feel lighter . You may be losing some weight , but much of it is water weight . " <p> Ancient roots <p> One of the most talked-about plans is the Master Cleanse , which was created more than 50 years ago by the late alternative-health guru Stanley Burroughs and is promoted by Peter Glickman in his book , Lose Weight , Have More Energy and Be Happier in 10 Days and on his website , TheRawFoodSite.com . He 's a layman who did the cleanse and is convinced it works . <p> Glickman says he does n't know of any scientific studies showing what chemicals or toxins are removed by the cleanse , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out toxins . He says government regulations prohibit him from making claims that the Master Cleanse cures anything . <p> " The only thing I can tell you is the cleanse has been used for decades by hundreds of thousands of people , and we have anecdotal stories that people lose weight , feel better , say aches and pains in their joints are reduced or go away , can breathe better and their skin looks healthier .

" <p> Nutrition experts say they 'd like to see some scientific evidence the plans work .

Nutritionists also are concerned that most cleansing diets are devoid of protein , which helps maintain muscle mass during weight loss . <p> Bonnie Taub-Dix , a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association and a registered dietitian in New York City , agrees that the lack of protein in many such diets makes them nutritionally inadequate . " It 's like getting dressed and putting on three shirts and no pants . They may be nice shirts , but you are missing other critical things . " <p> But Glickman says the body can go for days without protein and not be harmed . He says he knows of about 2,000 people who have done the Master Cleanse , and it " has n't harmed anyone 's health long-term . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that while she was doing the cleanse , " I was very hungry , therefore I was evil . When we wrapped the movie , I was so excited ... I ate a whole dozen Krispy Kreme doughnuts . " <p> Skip the junk food <p> Dietitians say some of the plans are n't calorie bargains . <p> Bauer calculated that drinking 12 cups of the Master Cleanse mixture is 1,300 calories , and for that amount , a dieter could have a full day 's worth of healthful foods including whole-grain cereal , milk , grapefruit , a turkey sandwich , carrots , nuts , salmon , salad and broccoli . <p> If you 're trying to detox your body of junk food , then stop eating that kind of food , she says . <p> Ayoob agrees . " There are plenty of ways to clean up your diet without having to go on a fast . Keep what you are eating very , very simple : You can have a nice clean diet by eating a lot of whole foods  --  fresh fruits , vegetables , whole grains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eating , and you can lose weight on it .
