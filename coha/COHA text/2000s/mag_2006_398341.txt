Civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has threatened the existence of wild bonobos , while new research on the hypersexual primate challenges their peace-loving reputation <p> Led by five trackers from the Mongandu tribe , I tread through a remote rain forest in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , on the trail of the bonobo , one of the world 's most astonishing creatures . Along with the chimpanzee , it 's our closest relative , with whom we share almost 99 percent of our genes . The last of the great apes to be discovered , it could be the first to become extinct in the wild : in the past few decades , bonobo habitat has been overrun by soldiers , and the apes have been slaughtered for food . Most estimates put the number of bonobos left in the wild at less than 2,000 . <p> As the narrow trail plunges into a gloomy ; rain-soaked tunnel through tall trees , Leonard , the head tracker , picks up a fallen leaf and brings it to his nose . " Bonobo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large , dark , hairy creature propped between the trunk and bough of a sturdy hardwood . " The alpha male , " Leonard whispers . " He 's sleeping . Keep quiet , because it means there are bonobos all around us . " <p> We creep toward the tree and sit beneath it . I try to ignore the fiery bites of ants crawling over my arms and legs as we wait for the bonobos to awaken . They are known to be gregarious , exceptionally intelligent primates , and the only apes whose society is said to be matriarchal. and orgiastic : they have sexual interactions several times a day and with a variety of partners . While chimpanzees and gorillas often settle disputes by fierce , sometimes deadly fighting , bonobos commonly make peace by engaging in feverish orgies in which males have intercourse with females and other males , and females with other females . No other great apes  --  a group that includes eastern gorillas , western gorillas , Bornean orangutans , Sumatran orangutans , chimps and , according to modern taxonomists , human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when these bonobos awaken , their signature behavior is nowhere in evidence . Instead , dung splatters the forest floor , flung at us by the alpha male . " He 's angry we 're here , " Leonard says softly . The male screams a warning to the other bonobos , and they respond with shrill cries . Through binoculars , I see many dark eyes peering down at me . A youngster shakes his fist at us . Moments later , the bonobos are gone , swinging and leaping from branch to branch , led across the rain forest canopy by the big male . <p> Because so much of what 's known about these animals has been based on observing them in captivity or in other unnatural settings , even my first encounter with them in the wild was revelatory . The alpha male 's bellicose display was just the first of several signs I would see over the next ten days that not all is peace and love in Bonoboland . Maybe it should n't be surprising , but this close relative of ours turns out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WAS AT GERMANY 'S FRANKFURT ZOO some years ago that I first got hooked on bonobos . One of their nicknames is pygmy chimp , and I had expected to see a smaller version of the chimpanzee , with the same swagger and strut in the males and timorous fealty in the females . Bonobos are smaller than chimps , all right  --  a male weighs about 85 to 95 pounds and a female , 65 to 85 pounds ; a male chimpanzee can weigh as much as 135 pounds . But the male bonobos I saw in the zoo , unlike the chimps , did not try to dominate the females . Both males and females strode about the enclosure picking up fruit and mingling with their friends . They looked strangely human with their upright , bipedal gait ; long , slim arms and legs ; slender neck ; and a body whose proportions resemble ours more than they do a chimp 's . More than anything , they reminded me of models I 'd seen of Australopithecus afarensis , the " ape man " who walked the African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneer primatologist Robert Yerkes of Yale University named a bright young primate captured in the wild " Prince Chim . " Comparing him with other chimpanzees he was studying , Yerkes said Prince Chim was an " intellectual genius . " Only in 1929 did scientists realize that bonobos are a distinct species ( Pan paniscus ) and not just undersized chimps ( Pan troglodytes ) , and we now know from photographs that Prince Chim was actually a bonobo . <p> The bonobo 's life history is typical for a great ape . A bonobo weighs about three pounds at birth and is carried around by its mother for the first few years . She protects the youngster and shares her nest with it for the first five or six years . Females give birth for the first time at age 13 to 15 ; males and females reach full size at about age 16 . They can live up to about 60 years . <p> Yerkes ' observation of superior intelligence has held up over the years , at least in captive animals . Some primatologists are convinced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms . <p> As I stood near the bonobo enclosure , an adolescent female named Ulindi reached through the bars and began to groom me , her long fingers tenderly searching through my hair for bugs . Satisfied I was clean , she offered her back for me to groom . After I did so ( she , too , was bug-free ) , I left to pay my respects to the group 's matriarch . Ulindi 's eyes burned with indignation , but minutes later she drew me back with a sweet gaze . She looked at me with what seemed affection  --  and suddenly tossed into my face a pile of wood shavings she 'd been hiding behind her back . She then flounced away . <p> In 1973 , a 35-year-old Japanese researcher named Takayoshi Kano , the first scientist to study bonobos extensively in the wild , spent months trudging through the dank forests of what was then Zaire ( formerly the Belgian Congo , now the Democratic Republic of the Congo ) before he finally encountered a foraging party of ten adults . To lure them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar cane deep in their habitat . Months later , he spied a bonobo group , 40 strong , feasting on the cane . " Seeing them so close , they seemed more than animals , more a reflection of ourselves , as if they were fairies of the forest , " Kano told me when I visited him in 1999 at Kyoto University 's Primate Research Center . <p> Kano expected bonobo groups to be dominated by aggressive males . Instead , females sat in the middle of the sugar cane field . They groomed each other , snacked , chatted in squeaks and grunts , and invited favored males to sit with them . On the rare occasion that an angry male charged a group of females , Kano told me , they either ignored him or chased him into the jungle . Kano 's observations shocked primatologists . " Among chimpanzees , every female of whatever rank is subordinate to every male of whatever rank , " says Richard Wrangham , a Harvard University primatologist . <p> Over time , Kano came to recognize 150 different individuals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ males . Kano finally concluded he was watching mothers with their sons . " I saw mothers and sons stay together and realized that mothers were the core of bonobo society , holding the group together , " he said . <p> One of the reasons to study primates is to better understand our own evolutionary history Bonobos and chimps are our closest living links to the six million-year-old ancestor from which both they and we descended . As primatologist Frans de Waal points out , Kano 's work " was a major revelation , because it proved the chimpanzee model was not the only one to point to our origins , that another primate akin to us had developed a social structure mirroring our own . " When Kano 's findings were publicized , in the 1970s , the animals ' friendly family relations , peaceable males , powerful females , high I.Q.s and energetic sex lives made the idea of sharing an evolutionary lineage with bonobos appealing . <p> Wild bonobos live within several hundred thousand acres of dense swampy equatorial forest bounded by the Congo and Kasai rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only 23 percent of their historic range remains undisturbed by logging , mining or war . From 1996 to 2003 , the country suffered back-to-back civil wars , and foreign researchers and conservationists stayed out of bonobo territory , which saw some of the fiercest fighting . The New York-based International Rescue Committee estimates that the strife constituted the world 's deadliest conflict since World War II , with five other African nations and numerous Congolese political factions fighting for territory and control of the DRC 's immense natural resources  --  copper , uranium , petroleum , diamonds , gold and coltan , an ore used in electronics . Some four million people have been killed . The conflict officially ended in April 2003 , with the ratification of a peace treaty between the DRC 's young president , Joseph Kabila , who seized power after his father , Laurent , was assassinated in 2001 , and several rebel groups . An uneasy truce has held since then , which has been tested during the run-up to a presidential election scheduled for October 29 . <p> TO OBSERVE BONOBOS in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DRC 's Equateur Province , a destitute-looking city of more than 100,000 people by the Congo River . Civil war has left the city without water or electricity ; mass graves of civilians executed by soldiers have been found on the city 's outskirts . I embark with three foreign and seven Congolese conservation workers on a trip upriver by motorized pirogues , canoes hacked from tree trunks . We start on the Congo River , one of the world 's longest at 2,900 miles from source to sea . Researchers say this geographic barrier , up to ten miles wide , has kept chimpanzees in jungles on the Congo River 's north side and bonobos on the south , which allowed them to evolve into separate species . <p> As darkness drops a velvet curtain along the great waterway ; we enter the Maringa tributary , which cuts deep into the heart of the Congo Basin . Twisting and turning like a giant snake , the Congo River is guarded on both banks by what Joseph Conrad , writing about it in Heart of Darkness , called a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trunks , branches , leaves , boughs , festoons motionless in the moonlight . " By day fish-eagles , herons , kingfishers and hornbills perch by the fast-flowing muddy water ; local people pole canoes from their straw huts to market . At night the riverbanks echo with the urgent thump of unseen drums and raucous singing . " <p> On our second morning , we pull in at Basankusu , a river-side town with a military base , where I show my permit to travel farther up the river . This area was a center of opposition to President Kabila , and government functionaries treat strangers with suspicion . Fierce battles between Kabila 's forces and those of Jean-Pierre Bemba , who controlled the north , were waged here , and sunken barges still lie rusting in the shallows . According to the relief agency Doctors Without Borders , 10 percent of Basankusu 's population perished over a 12-month period beginning in 2000 . There is a brooding menace here , and I sense that a wrong word or movement could spark an explosion of violence . As our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shamans clad in leafy headdresses and skirts charge toward the river chanting war cries . " It 's their morning exercise , " a local man assures me . <p> All along the river I see grim evidence of the fighting . Much of the DRC 's prewar export income came from rubber , timber and coffee plantations along the Maringa , but the riverside buildings are now deserted and crumbling , mangled by artillery fire and pockmarked by bullets . " The military looted everything along the river , even light sockets , and it 'll take a long time to return to normal , " says Michael Hurley , the leader of this expedition and executive director of Bonobo Conservation Initiative ( BCI ) , a Washington , D.C.-based nonprofit organization . <p> By the fifth day , the river has narrowed to 20 yards , and the river-side villages have all but disappeared . Trees tower over us , and we slow to dog-paddle speed . At night a ghostly mist settles on the river . We tie the pirogues to reeds and camp on the boats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On day six , 660 miles from Mbandaka , the riverbank throngs with villagers who have come to carry our supplies on a two-hour walk through the jungle to our destination , Kokolopori , a group of villages . Bofenge Bombanga , a powerful-looking shaman from the Mongandu tribe clad in a loincloth and headdress made from dried hornbill beaks , leads a welcoming dance . Afterward , in one of many tribal fables I will hear about the bonobos , he tells me that a village elder was once trapped high in a tree after his climbing vine came loose  --  and a passing bonobo helped him down . " Since then it has been taboo for villagers to kill a bonobo , " he says through an interpreter . <p> But others say the taboo on bonobo meat is not observed in some areas . As a Congolese bonobo conservationist named Lingomo Bongoli told me , " Since the war , outsiders have come here , and they tell our young people that bonobo meat gives you strength . Too many believe them . " In an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four people admitted to having eaten bonobo meat . Soldiers  --  rebel and government  --  were the worst offenders . <p> In the village we are greeted by Albert Lokasola , once secretary general of the DRC 's Red Cross and now head of Vie Sauvage , a Congolese conservation group . His group is working to establish a bonobo reserve on the 1,100 square miles of Kokolopori that are home to an estimated 1,500 bonobos . Vie Sauvage employs 36 trackers from local villages ( at a wage of $20 per man per month ) to follow five bonobo groups and protect them from poachers . It also funds cash crops such as cassava and rice and small businesses such as soap-making and tailoring to deter villagers from poaching . Funding for the project , about $250,000 per year , comes from BCI and other conservation groups . <p> On day seven , after a tough trek scrambling over fallen trees and across slippery logs , we finally see what I have come all this way to see  --  bonobos , nine of them , part of the 40-member group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I notice is the animals ' athletic build . At the Frankfurt Zoo , even males had the slim , elegant stature of ballet dancers , but jungle males are broad shouldered and well muscled , and the females too are bulky <p> As he sits high on a limb munching fistfuls of leaves , the alpha male exudes dignity ( even though he 's the one who threw feces at me ) . Above us in the canopy , young and old bonobos are feasting . A male juvenile lies in the crook of a tree with one leg dangling down into space and the other resting at a right angle on the trunk , like a teenager on a sofa . Two females stop eating for a few moments to rub their swollen genitals together . <p> My heart stops as a youngster casually steps off a branch maybe 30 yards up and plunges toward the forest floor through branches and leaves . About ten yards before crashing into the ground , he grabs a branch and swings onto it . I 'm told by the trackers that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invariably concludes with a wide grin on the acrobat 's face . <p> Suddenly , the alpha male pucker his pink lips and lets loose a scream , a signal for the troop to move . He leads the way , hurtling from tree to tree just below the canopy I stumble beneath them , trying to keep up , banging my head into low branches and tripping on vines spread like veins across the forest floor . After about 300 yards , the bonobos settle into another clump of trees and begin stripping branches and shoving leaves by the fistful into their mouths . About noon , they go to sleep . <p> When they wake after a couple of hours , the bonobos come down onto the ground , in search of plants and worms , moving so swiftly through the forest that we see them only as blurs of dark fur . I spy a female walking upright across a moss-covered log , her long arms held high in the air for balance like a tightrope walker . <p> As the setting sun paints the rain forest gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and swings his humanlike legs , for all the world appearing to be deep in thought as the sun slips below the canopy rim . <p> LATER IN THE WEEK , I follow the Hali-Hali group for 24 hours . I see that they spend much of the day feeding or dozing . At night , they settle in a clump of trees high in the canopy and build their springy nests , yanking leafy branches and weaving them into resting places . Chimps build night nests too , but theirs are not as elaborate as bonobo cradles , which resemble giant bird nests . Their chatter drifts away , and by 6 p.m. , as the light leaches from the sky , each bonobo has settled out of sight in a leafy bed . <p> The trackers and I retreat for half an hour through the jungle . I crawl into a one-man tent , while the trackers sleep in the open around a fire they keep going all night to ward off leopards . At 5 a.m. , I crouch with the trackers beneath the trees as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to their nests  --  breakfast in bed , bonobo-style . A female swings to the next tree and rubs genitals with another female for about a minute , squeaking , while a male and a female , balanced on a bough , mate face to face , her legs wrapped around his waist . An hour later the troop swings off into the jungle . No one knows exactly why bonobos have sex so often . One leading explanation is that it maintains bonds within the community ; another is that it prevents males from knowing which infants they sired and thus encourages them to protect all of the young in a group . Bonobo males are affectionate and attentive to infants ; chimpanzee males , in contrast , are known to kill the offspring of rival males . <p> Back at camp , I meet with two Congolese researchers from the Ministry of Scientific Research and Technology . They had ridden bikes 35 miles along a jungle path from the village of Wamba . One of them , Mola Ihomi , spends the year at Wamba collecting bonobo data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution at which Kano worked years ago . The bonobo groups studied so far usually range in size from 25 to 75 members . The animals have what primatologists call a fission-fusion social structure , in which the group gathers together at night to sleep but splits into smaller parties during the day to forage . The groups include males and females , adults and young . <p> Bonobo researchers no longer lure their subjects with sugar cane . In fact , Ihomi says , some scientists point out that Kano observed bonobos in an unnatural situation . Normally , bonobos eat leaves and fruit , and there 's plenty to go around . But enticed into the sugar cane field , the animals were out of their treetop habitat and competing for a concentrated resource . By watching bonobos in more natural settings , Ihomi and others have discovered that females are not necessarily as dominant as they appear in the sugar cane field . " The alpha male is usually in charge , " Ihomi says . The alpha male determines where the troop eats and sleeps and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the troop from leopards and pythons . But bonobo society is still much less authoritarian than that of other great apes . " If the alpha female does n't want to follow him , she sits there and then the rest of the troop follows her lead and do n't move , " Ihomi says . " She always has the last say . It 's like the alpha male is the general and the alpha female is the queen . " <p> Researchers also now believe that the bonobo creed of making love , not war , is not as absolute as earlier studies suggested . Near Wamba , Ihomi says , he and his colleagues tracked three bonobo groups , two of which engaged in rambunctious sex when they ran into each other . But when the groups ran into the third group , " which is n't often , " he says , " they display fiercely to defend their territory , males and females screaming , throwing dung and sticks at each other . They even fight , sometimes inflicting serious bite wounds . " <p> Primatologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimpanzees and other great apes , which are known to fight to the death over females or territory Ihomi says , " I have never seen a bonobo kill another bonobo . " <p> The effort to save wild bonobos is hampered by a lack of basic information . One urgent chore is to determine how many of the animals are left in the wild . By all estimates , their numbers are well down since the 1970s . " Political instability , the threat of renewed civil war , a surging human population , the thriving bush-meat trade and the destruction of bonobo habitat in the DRC is hurrying them toward extinction in the wild , " says Daniel Malonza , a spokesman for The Great Apes Survival Project , a United Nations body set up five years ago to arrest the dramatic decline of the great apes . <p> In Mbandaka , Jean Marie Benishay , BCI 's national director , showed me a photograph of bonobo skulls and bones that had been on sale at a village market for use in rituals . The seller told him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park , southwest of Kokolopori , where they were once common but are rarely sighted these days . Gruesome as the photograph was , Benishay looks encouraged . " They come from a place where we thought bonobos had disappeared , " he said with a grim smile . " This proves bonobos are still out there .
