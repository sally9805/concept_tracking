<p> Chief Warrant Officer Lewis Welshofer told his mother he was far from the notorious prison outside Baghdad that is the center of the Iraqi prisoner- <p> abuse scandal . <p> The U.S. Army base where he was stationed is 200 miles from Abu Ghraib prison . But Welshofer never mentioned that military authorities are investigating him and another chief warrant officer in another prisoner-abuse case - the death of a high-ranking Iraqi general , according to Pentagon documents . <p> ' Do n't worry about that , I was n't anywhere near that prison , ' Sarah Welshofer recalled her son , who is back at Fort Carson , saying when she asked about the growing prisoner-abuse scandal . <p> Sarah Welshofer said she has heard nothing about the death of Maj. Gen. Abed Hamed Mowhoush , a top officer in Saddam Hussein 's military at a Qaim detention facility on Nov. 26 , 2003 . <p> Mowhoush , who had turned himself in Nov. 10 , died during an interrogation conducted by Welshofer and another officer , according to a summary of investigative reports obtained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Other Governmental Agency ' employees , a term often used to describe CIA officers , beat Mowhoush in the days before his death , according to the summary . <p> Welshofer , in a brief telephone interview Thursday , first conceded he was part of an investigation and then denied it . <p> Asked if he had done anything wrong , he said , ' Absolutely not . I saved lives . a You print whatever you want . ' He hung up without further explanation . <p> But the 20-page summary of investigations into the abuse and death of Iraqi prisoners and civilians describes Welshofer 's case as one officials are investigating . <p> Along with alleged human-rights violations , the incident raises the question of whether the military lost key information when Mowhoush died . <p> ' You do n't want to kill off your sources . It 's not a good way to operate , ' said retired Army Col. Dan Smith , a Vietnam veteran who specialized in military intelligence and is now affiliated with a Quaker lobbying group . ' From an information-gathering perspective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about what 's going on there . ' <p> Welshofer 's and Mowhoush 's paths crossed at an outpost on the Euphrates River near the Syrian border , the investigative report shows . <p> In mid-October , members of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment , based at Fort Carson , remodeled an abandoned train station for its base , according to GlobalSecurity.org , a defense and intelligence think tank . <p> Military intelligence experts said that a prisoner of war , such as an Iraqi general , has to provide only name , rank and serial number under the Geneva Conventions and that physical force is never permitted in interrogations . <p> But if the investigation report is accurate , the Army was demanding more from Mowhoush than his name and rank . <p> Other U.S. officials beat Mowhoush , and days later , Welshofer and another officer took over the interrogation , the investigative summary says . <p> ' It is estimated that MG Mowhoush was interrogated at least once each day he was in custody , ' the investigative summary says . ' Approximately 24 to 48 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned by ( other governmental agency officials ) , and statements suggest that MG Mowhoush was beaten during that interrogation . ' A CIA spokeswoman declined to comment . <p> When Welshofer and his partner took over , they slid a sleeping bag over Mowhoush 's head and rolled him from his back and to his stomach while asking questions , the documents allege . <p> Then , Welshofer sat on Mowhoush 's chest and placed his hands over the general 's mouth , the report says . Mowhoush died during the interrogation , and both officers were reprimanded , the documents say . The investigation for a possible court-martial continues , according to the documents , which are dated in early May . <p> The internal investigative report says Mowhoush 's death ' appears to be individual misconduct . ' <p> But Smith , the retired colonel , who has written articles critical of the military 's treatment of Iraqi prisoners , said it is more likely that top officials set the stage by demanding information that would help save American lives . He also said interrogations are never handled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to work , they 're suppose to develop an interrogation plan , ' Smith said . ' The plan is approved by supervisors . ' <p> After Mowhoush 's death , the military issued a news release that said ' he did not feel well and subsequently lost consciousness . a It appeared Mowhoush died of natural causes . ' <p> That release remained Thursday on the website of the Combined Joint Task Force 7 Operation Iraqi Freedom , which , according to the Pentagon documents , is part of the investigation into the incident . <p> A task force spokesman , who declined to give his name , said the release was not an attempt to mislead people in Mowhoush 's death and that he has no information contradicting it . <p> ' There 's nothing nefarious , ' the spokesman said . ' It 's poor communication . ' <p> But the investigative summary says an initial autopsy report showed ' evidence of blunt force trauma to the chest and legs . ' <p> The other interrogator who was with Welshofer could not be reached for comment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was in Iraq between April 2003 and April 2004 . It is primarily an electronic surveillance unit , although exactly what those soldiers were doing in Iraq is classified , said Fort Carson spokesman Richard Bridges . <p> University of Georgia professor Loch Johnson , who specializes in military intelligence , said it would be unusual to send an electronic-surveillance expert in to do an interrogation . <p> ' It 's not very good protocol , ' he said . <p> The investigative documents refer to Welshofer as an interrogator . <p> Born in 1962 , Welshofer grew up in Middletown , Ohio , as the middle of five children of Lewis Sr. and Sarah Welshofer , said his mother , who still lives in Ohio . His father was a manager at the local steel mill , and his mother was a schoolteacher . <p> Welshofer was a typical child who loved sports , but he was a late bloomer , Sarah Welshofer said in a phone interview . <p> ' He did n't do his growing until he was in a junior or senior in high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loved sports . ' <p> Welshofer had a job at a local golf course while attending Ohio 's Miami University , where he studied business and psychology . ' He became disenchanted with psychology when they got into the weird behaviors , ' she said . <p> Sarah Welshofer said her son always wanted to be a schoolteacher , but his father discouraged it because the pay was low . <p> Welshofer quit a few credits short of his degree at Miami University , later receiving his degree at another college . <p> He joined a bank doing collections . That did not pay much , so he decided on a career in the military that would more closely match his interest in sports and staying active . <p> He was chosen to specialize in military intelligence and , during the Cold War , was sent to school to learn Russian . <p> His job took him and his wife around the world , including California , Germany , Texas , Italy and Hawaii . Each of his three children , the oldest of whom is in middle school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he went to Iraq . <p> Mowhoush 's history is not as clear . <p> He came from a family of farmers and shepherds and supported the two wives and nine children of his brother , who died in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s , according to the Los Angeles Times . Mowhoush , 57 , was a high-ranking official in the Baath Party and commanded troops in Basra , where coalition forces saw some of the worst fighting , the Times story said . <p> U.S. military news releases describe him as an air force officer in Hussein 's regime and a leader of the resistance to the American invasion . <p> News reports say he was captured during a raid , but the investigative documents obtained by The Post say he turned himself in at Forward Operating Base Tiger . <p> At the time , November was becoming the deadliest month to date in Iraq , weapons of mass destructions were nowhere to be found and coalition forces were frantically searching for Hussein and anyone else in his inner circle . <p> At home , President Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a surprise visit to Baghdad for Thanksgiving with the troops the day after . <p> Welshofer and the other chief warrant officer remain free , living on or near the base . <p> Welshofer is selling his house , his mother said , because he is being transferred in August to Fort Huachuca , Ariz. , to teach military intelligence . <p> Denver Post research librarian Monnie Nilsson contributed to this report . <p> Staff writer Arthur Kane can be reached at 303-820-1626 or akane@denverpost.com.
