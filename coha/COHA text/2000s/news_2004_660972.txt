<p> US marines seal off the hotbed city of Fallujah in Iraq . American snipers approach Vietnam-era kill rates . Foot patrols use portable battering rams to enter through walls , to avoid booby-trapped doors . <p> President Bush vowed last week that " resolute action " would be used to quell the uprising in Iraq . Monday the hardening US military policy showed signs of working : Fallujah civic leaders called on militants to surrender their heavy weapons ; if they do , US forces promised not to resume their offensive against the besieged city . <p> " It would appear there is an agreed political track , " Brig . Gen. Mark Kimmitt told reporters Monday . " There is also a very clear understanding ... that should this agreement not go through , Marine forces are more than prepared to carry through with military operations " and could seize Fallujah " in fairly short order . " <p> The standoff highlights the minefield of risks being navigated by the US military , as it toughens its tactics in the face of an insurgency that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The dilemma : How to use forceful tactics - which are widely seen as drawn from Israel 's uncompromising playbook , against Palestinian militants - without alienating the entire population . <p> " Even if we crush the resistance , it is only temporary , " warns Charles Smith , head of Near Eastern Studies at the University of Arizona . " There are too many cases , like in Israel , of US forces doing target practice on anything that moves . What you are doing is creating more terrorism against yourself . " <p> The price has been high . More Americans ( 99 ) have already lost their lives in April than in any other single month , including the 1991 Gulf War and the 2003 invasion . Ten times more Iraqis have died , most of them in Fallujah , by the reckoning of US officials - taking the Iraqi toll to at least 900 . <p> The Los Angeles Times reported Saturday that the " top sniper " in Fallujah - a corporal from a Midwestern city - had 24 confirmed kills in less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted , with the Marine Corps sniper record in Vietnam of 103 kills in 16 months . <p> What is raising the bar higher for American troops in Iraq , however , is the fact that the enemy may be largely inured to fear , after suffering decades of the most brutal violence at the hands of Saddam Hussein . <p> Israeli influence <p> The US military has adopted tough-minded Israeli occupation strategies . Longstanding ties between the Pentagon and Israeli Defense Forces have grown much closer since the run-up to the Iraq campaign . Israel has shared advice on counterinsurgency and even allowed US training for urban combat at mock villages in Israel 's Negev desert . <p> Such innovations have so far had limited success in stopping Palestinian suicide bombings , even with an Israeli policy of assassinating key militants . Some senior Israeli military and security chiefs criticize them as counterproductive . <p> " Jenin does come to mind in Iraq , " says Phebe Marr , an Iraq expert and former US government intelligence analyst , referring to Israel 's controversial two-week siege of that West Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them civilians , according to Human Rights Watch - and 23 Israeli soldiers dead . Continuing unrest prompted Israeli forces to storm back three more times that spring . <p> Ms. Marr questions the US strategy in Fallujah . <p> " I do n't think you can have a good strategy to drain the swamp if you do n't know what 's in the swamp , " says Ms. Marr , who spoke by telephone from Doha , Qatar . " I do n't think the entire Iraqi population wants to see us fail there . But we saw what happened in Jenin - you must hit them hard , and not kill all of Fallujah . " <p> Concern has also been voiced by US allies . A senior British Army officer in southern Iraq , quoted last week in London 's Daily Telegraph , said : " My view and the view of the British chain of command is that the Americans ' use of violence is not proportionate and is overresponsive to the threat they are facing . " <p> Tentative cease-fires on two fronts - against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baghdad , and Shiite militants loyal to the fiercely anti-American cleric Moqtada al-Sadr in southern Iraq - have brought relative calm . <p> ' Iron wall syndrome ' <p> But American vows to destroy the insurgents and " kill or capture " Mr. Sadr and his black-clad militia - groups that were once marginal , at best - are feeding increasingly wide support among Iraqis , and turning Fallujah into a new anti-US rallying cry . <p> " US forces are going through the iron wall syndrome , " says Mr. Smith , referring to the post-World War II Zionist creed adopted by some leaders in the newbornstate of Israel , which holds that Arabs should be dealt with only from a position of unassailable power . By the 1950s , the idea had been refined to ensure disproportionate casualties , so that Israeli blood would appear to be more costly than Arab blood . <p> The reaction is clear for many Iraqis . The walls of Baghdad are growing crowded with fresh graffiti that underscore how Fallujah has become the beacon of resistance . " Long live the Holy War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long live Fallujah ! Long live the Mahdi army ! " and " Death to America ! " <p> " In Fallujah Americans are acting out of proportion to the deaths of four US contractors . I understand their anger , but they get poor marks , " says Gailan Ramiz , a Harvard-educated political scientist in Baghdad . " I am convinced now , they created a situation where Iraqis are in total psychological revolt . " <p> Iraqis solidly back Palestinians against Israel , so pursuing methods similar to Israel 's " is a great error , since the US is not imperial , and does n't have the same interests as Israel , " says Ramiz . " So why use the tactics of the Israelis ? Iraqis accepted Saddam , as the Spanish accepted Franco . But for a foreign army to do this sparks nationalist fervor . " <p> Mr. Bush last week declared that there was " no safe alternative to resolute action " to regain control . But as US troops dig in , Middle East history shows that total control often comes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the precedent in 1982 , when he ordered the sealing off and shelling of entire districts of the city of Hama to get at Muslim Brotherhood activists . Bulldozers finished the job , leaving some 10,000 people dead . Islamists did not reemerge for more than two decades in Syria . <p> Saddam Hussein is infamous for gassing 5,000 Kurds in 1988 , and killing tens of thousands of accused opponents and other Iraqis over the years . This is one reason Washington toppled the regime , but it has not been easy to intimidate Iraqi insurgents . <p> " Fear , fear , and executions " is how Hussein maintained control , explains a former Iraqi special-forces officer , who is no stranger to danger . In the 1980s , during the Iran-Iraq war , he conducted seven operations behind enemy lines as part of a six-man team armed with a rifle , knife , appetite suppressant pills , and an explosive belt to be used if capture was inevitable . <p> But the revenge meted out by the regime that he witnessed in March 1991 - as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north and Shiite rebels in the south was at its peak - still brings tears to his eyes . <p> " It is something you ca n't describe , " he says , as he talks about being tasked to guard a bus from Baghdad with 16 Iraqi Shiites accused of taking part in the uprising . In what was the most fearful moment of his life , the officer was asked to don a gas mask and escort the prisoners . Blindfolded and handcuffed , the Shiites were led into a large chamber and thrown into a pool full of acid . <p> Americans should be mindful of this lesson , for what it says about Iraqi standards of intimidation . " Iraqis are used to being punished , " says the officer . " They are used to fear . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
