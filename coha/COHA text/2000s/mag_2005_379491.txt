Four months after their barefoot beach wedding on the Caribbean island of St. John , actress RENEE ZELLWEGER , 36 , and her country-singer husband KENNY CHESNEY , 37 , have suddenly filed to annul their sudden marriage . In court papers , the Bridget Jones star cited " fraud " as the official reason for the annulment  --  a legal declaration that the union was invalid from the start  --  but clarified that the term is " simply legal language and not a reflection of Kenny 's character " ( though we 're not sure she was around long enough to judge ) . In plain language , fraud means one partner deceived the other about a matter vital to the marriage , like a plot to gain citizenship  --  or , perhaps , that the bare feet and cowboy hat were n't really just for special occasions .
