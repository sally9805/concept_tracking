I am really looking forward to the year 2005 . That 's when a large clinical trial called the Women 's Health Initiative ( WHI ) should finally answer the question " Do the benefits of taking estrogen and progestin for years , even decades , after menopause outweigh any risks ? " There has been lots of evidence over the years that the answer is yes and yet plenty of data that lean toward no . Just last week a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association said that taking estrogen for 10 years or more doubles a woman 's risk of dying from ovarian cancer . Is it any wonder women are confused ? <P> The WHI should pretty well settle the matter because it 's a randomized , placebo-controlled trial , the most rigorous type of study researchers know how to design . More than 27,000 women , ages 50 and older , are taking either the drugs or a dummy pill for anywhere from eight to 12 years . Because neither they nor the medical staff running the program knows who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as objective as humanly possible . <P> Until then , whenever any new study  --  like the ovarian-cancer report  --  comes along , you have to consider it as part of the larger picture . The first thing you must realize , says Dr. Carmen Rodriguez , a senior epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society who led the study , is that a woman 's chances of dying from ovarian cancer are pretty low  --  about 1.7% over the course of her lifetime . Twice a low risk is still a low risk . ( Study participants who took estrogen actually lived longer than those who did n't  --  partly because such volunteers often live healthier lives and have better access to medical care . ) <P> Next , keep in mind that the J.A.M.A . study was conducted at a time when most doctors still gave women estrogen by itself . Since then , women who have n't undergone a hysterectomy have generally received estrogen plus progestin because the combo reduces the risk of uterine cancer . It 's quite possible taking both drugs reduces the risk of ovarian cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as confident of the health benefits of long-term hormone therapy as they used to be . Investigators were surprised last year when preliminary evidence from the WHI revealed that taking estrogen with or without progestin slightly increased the risk of blood clots , heart attacks and strokes over a two-year period . The researchers are waiting for the final results to see if the short-term risk is outweighed by any long-term protection for the heart . <P> Meanwhile , no one is denying that hormone therapy has some pretty powerful short-term benefits . " Estrogen is still the most effective treatment for hot flashes and perimenopausal symptoms , " notes Dr. JoAnn Manson , chief of preventive medicine at Harvard 's Brigham and Women 's Hospital . Nor is there anything in the latest study to suggest that women should avoid taking hormones for a few years around menopause . However , as a practical matter , women who have a family history of ovarian cancer or have undergone a partial hysterectomy ( ovaries still intact ) may want to rethink their choices for long-term hormone replacement .
