<p> BAGHDAD , Iraq  --  It was the first time weapons inspectors had entered one of Saddam Hussein 's presidential palaces . Iraqis were jittery about giving them access . <p> Relenting , the Iraqi guards opened the gates , and the inspectors rushed in . Some headed for a kitchen , where they pulled open a refrigerator door . The inspectors grabbed some marmalade jars and peered into a box containing a mysterious sticky substance . <p> " What 's this ? " a U.N . staff member demanded . " Baklava , " an Iraqi official said , referring to the honey-soaked Middle Eastern dessert . <p> Last week 's inspection at Al-Sajoud Palace was typical of the frustrations faced by inspectors as they near the end of their third week of work . The United Nations effort to locate any remaining weapons programs in Iraq will be time-consuming and possibly inconclusive , some experts say . Even after thorough inspections are conducted , the monitors may not find evidence that Baghdad is developing weapons of mass destruction , as the United States insists is happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the inspectors will find anything that the Iraqis do n't want them to find , " says Gary Milhollin , director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control in Washington . " At some point , they will have to get fresh intelligence that leads them to somewhere . " <p> The U.S. public also is skeptical that weapons inspectors will find anything incriminating . A USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll taken Monday and Tuesday found that of 460 Americans who said they believe Iraq has banned weapons , 73% said inspectors wo n't uncover them . <p> In the four years since the last inspections , Iraq has had plenty of time to cover up efforts to build or deploy weapons . Short of a defector willing to spill secrets , the inspectors may only be able to build a circumstantial case based on visits to factories and research centers . More inspectors arrived in Baghdad this week and began increasing the number of visits to sites . The first report is due to the Security Council Jan. 27 . <p> What they uncover could trigger a war against Saddam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce weapons of mass destruction , the United States risks losing the support of its allies . " If inspectors ca n't find any bad things , then I personally do n't think Iraq really has them , " said a European diplomat in Baghdad . <p> ' Delicate moment ' <p> " We 're caught in the middle of a much larger political game , " says Hiro Ueki , a Japanese diplomat who serves as the Baghdad spokesman for the U.N . Monitoring , Verification and Inspection Commission . " This is a delicate moment . " <p> Officials hope to have 100 inspectors in Iraq by Christmas . <p> Most of the nearly 70 monitors in Iraq are scientists accustomed to long , quiet days in research labs . They say they need months to determine whether Saddam has hidden chemical or biological weapons or nuclear material , or still has long-range missiles capable of striking his neighbors . <p> Despite pressure from the Bush administration , inspectors insist their hunt will be painstaking and require patience . <p> " It will definitely be slow , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first group of monitors when inspections resumed last month . They are scouring a country about double the size of Idaho in search of microscopic anthrax spores or mustard gas residue . <p> They also could drift for months in a gray area of " dual-use " manufacturing , factories that have civilian and military applications . One site that weapons inspectors visited last month housed a graphite plant and a former facility for testing missiles . " The dual sites are going to be the trickiest things to prove , " says Judith Yaphe , an expert on the Iraqi military at the National Defense University in Washington . " It 's very easy to cover up bad-use chemicals with chemicals with good use . " <p> The scientists ' methodical approach has frustrated the White House . U.S. officials say the inspectors will not be aggressive enough to avoid being hoodwinked by Iraq . They say Saddam is a master of deception who has hidden weapons and weapons components and stashed biological and chemical toxins in innocent-looking places . <p> Little information was retrieved during the last U.N @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained inspectors were spying for their Western foes and blocked them from visiting several key sites . <p> The inspectors were withdrawn before U.S. and British bombing strikes on Iraq . Back then , the best intelligence came from scientists who had defected after the Gulf War in 1991 and others with intimate knowledge of Iraq 's weapons programs . <p> This time , no new defectors have surfaced . The United Nations said this week that Iraq has n't complied with a demand made two weeks ago for a list of scientists who are said to know about the weapons programs . Even if these experts are produced , it 's not likely they would help the inspectors . One defector who returned to Baghdad in 1995 after giving information to the CIA was assassinated . <p> The White House says it will give inspectors new information that could help them in their search . <p> ' We do n't trust anything ' <p> Inspectors chafe at the notion they are being duped by Baghdad . " We do n't take anything at face value , " says Mark Gwozdecky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We do n't trust anything . We verify . " <p> This time , the inspectors are driving in circles before heading out of town , so Iraqi officials ca n't figure out their destination . They try to arrive at laboratories and military plants before Iraqis have time to guess the day 's game plan and conceal any banned weapons . <p> The United Nations plans to dispatch about six helicopters that they hope will allow inspectors to move to sites quickly , before Baghdad can conduct a cleanup . <p> Many days , Iraqi officials traveling with the inspectors appear to radio ahead to the sites before the U.N . teams are scheduled to show up . Iraqi security officials seem to anticipate their arrival . " We assume that most places are n't secure . And that includes our cars , " Ueki says . <p> Since an overheard conversation could tip off Iraqis about what the inspectors plan to do each day , scientists ca n't discuss their work in most public and private settings . " Let 's just say we 've learned ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> They go for walks when they want to talk to each other and sometimes pass notes among themselves when they fear listening devices . <p> Details of the day 's inspection plan are known to only a few team members before the Jeeps leave the U.N . offices in a hotel on the edge of Baghdad . <p> U.N . experts sweep every room and telephone used by the inspectors to find electronic listening devices that may have been planted by Iraqi officials . <p> The inspectors ' Baghdad home , the Al-Hyatt Tower Hotel , is off-limits to visitors and is guarded by Iraqi police . <p> Experts say the best hope for a breakthrough is for someone inside Saddam 's weapons program to divulge where Iraq has hidden its banned arsenal . <p> U.N . officials said they have a plan to help whistleblowers come forward . They would not provide details . <p> Inspectors had virtually stalled in their weapons hunt during the 1990s until Hussein Kamel , Saddam 's son-in-law and the longtime head of Iraq 's secret weapons program , fled the country in 1995 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led inspectors to a chicken farm on the outskirts of Baghdad , where they discovered more than 500,000 documents and pieces of microfilm detailing weapons programs , including atomic weapons research . <p> Saddam persuaded Kamel to return to Baghdad to live with the president 's daughter and grandchildren , saying he had forgiven his betrayal . Back in Baghdad , the Iraqi leader immediately sent men to kill Kamel at his home . <p> After Kamel 's murder , Iraqi scientists probably think twice about sharing their secrets with weapons inspectors . <p> " If anyone thinks Iraqi scientists are going to flock to them ( U.N . officials ) they are really mistaken , " Yaphe says . <p> TEXT WITHIN GRAPHIC BEGINS HERE <p> Iraqi sites visted by United Nations weapons inspectors <p> Inspection teams : <p> International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) <p> United Nations Monitoring , Verification and Inspection Commission ( UNMOVIC ) <p> Date <p> Facilty <p> Reason for inspection <p> *** <p> November 27 <p> Al-Tahidi , Scientific research center <p> Previously linked to nuclear program <p> November 27 <p> Al-Rafah , Missil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for pencils of missile batteries <p> Novermber 28 <p> Al-Dawrah , Foot and mouth disease vaccination laboratory <p> Biological weapons had been found and tagged by previous inspectors <p> November 28 <p> Dhu Al-Fiqar and Al-Nasr , Factories producing small-arms ammunition and heavy machinery <p> Factories also could make biological weapons <p> November 30 <p> Al-Qa Qaa , Missile facility involved in nuclear research <p> Inspectors removed previously installed air samplers <p> November 30 <p> Al-Meelad , Electronic research company <p> Former Al-Furat centrifuge facility ;
