No judges , no timing . Just boardercrossers at the starting gate ready to go full speed down the course . // The wild sport of boardercross turns ski slopes into a full-contact track meet . Racing side-by-side , four teenagers blasted out of the starting gates , sprinting for the first turn at Copper Mountain , Colo . Sean Marshall , 14 , quickly moved into second as the snowboarders soared down the obstacle course . But Sean could n't believe his eyes when he zoomed around the next turn . Lying directly in his path was the lead racer , who had fallen . " I tried to squeeze by him , " says Sean of Troop 40 in Frisco , Colo . " But I slid on a patch of ice , lost my balance and slammed into the safety net . " Though his head ached , Sean got up , headed back downhill and managed to finish in second place . A Party Atmosphere As Sean discovered , boardercross racing is fast-paced  --  and more . At a typical event at Copper Mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the breeze and 160 competitors , ages 6 to 60 , jam the course . At dozens of other resorts from Okemo , Vt. , to Northstar-at-Tahoe , Calif. , riders race four , five or six at a time down twisting , man-made courses . The more the merrier  --  at least for the spectators . " Six at a time is real crowded , " Sean says . " It 's hard to dodge each other . Sometimes we 're bumping elbows and boards . One kid ran his board up on the back of mine . " Motocross on the Snow Riders must steer in , out , around and over obstacles while careening down courses at 20 to 45 miles per hour . Barriers vary from red-and-blue gates in the snow to jumps and bumps that launch boarders into the air . The wild scene is similar to bicycle motocross , or BMX . First one across the finish line wins . No need for a clock . Boardercross Has Them All Beat ' Kids like Sean are wild about boardercross because of its nonstop action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skateboard and go mountain biking , " he says . " But boardercross has them all beat . " Nick Kalb , 9 , and Ben Lynch , 11 , agree . They 've caught boardercross fever too . Nick , a Cub Scout in Frisco , Colo. , Pack 1012 , competes in a regional race series at Copper Mountain . Ben , a Webelos Scout in Pack 197 in Kremmling , Colo. , races at Winter Park . Bigger ? Older ? Bring ' Em On In the 1998-99 season , Nick finished in the top three at every event he entered at Copper Mountain in the 8 to 9 age group , and he proved his skill by finishing third in the Nationals at Telluride , Colo . Ben may be small at 4 feet , 70 pounds . But he 's got tremendous heart . At Winter Park , he competes against bigger , stronger kids up to age 14 . " I 've won several heats against them too , " beams Ben . " My friends think that 's pretty cool . " Look Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 13 , of Troop 231 in Vail Valley , Colo. , is into soccer and computers too . His snowboarding coach on the Vail Development Team urged him to give boardercross a try this past season . " Boardercross was a strange experience at first , " says Deacon , who was used to solo snowboarding events . " All of a sudden , I had to watch out for kids in front , behind and beside me . " Strategy Is Important Deacon also learned that , although boardercross looks frenzied and frantic to spectators , lots of strategy is involved . " Me start is the key , " he says . " If you 're lucky and get to start from a gate on the far left or right , that can help you get to the first turn ahead of everyone . That advantage often determines the winner . " Photograph Boardercrossers call them gates . They look more like upside-down flagpoles. // With so many racers jockeying for position , spills are common . Yet injuries are few and mostly minor . All racers wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen only one serious accident . It happened at Nationals . " A kid broke his wrist when he collided with another racer , " he says . The key : Maintain control . Big air off the jumps looks good , and its fun . But it also slows you down . And with five other racers chasing you , you ca n't afford to slow down .

Sidebar ON COURSE Gary Morgan who was a Boy Scout in his native New Zealand , builds and maintains courses for boardercross races at Northstar-at-Tahoe , Calif . " Safety comes first , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are far away from trees , and we limit the top speed to 45 miles per hour . " We keep the speed down by putting in lots of obstacles . " A typical course is a half-mile long and 150 feet wide . Riders cover that distance in 60 to 90 seconds . // <p>
