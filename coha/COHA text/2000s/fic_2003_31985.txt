Chapter One TEARS ON MY NECK To : danpoole@backspring.com From : kellison@cdrc.ec Date : August 5 , 2001 Subject : Request for help , urgent Dear Dan , It ; s terrible after you havent heard from me for so long for me to finzlly email you aking a favr . This is rude of me inded but this is a favor th doing of which will also be a favor to you Im sure . A good friend of mine is coming to the DC area . It appears she has a rare form of cancer ( relapse ) that the National Institutes of Health is interested in trying tp treat . I wonder if you can vist her she has no friends in the area there . I told her about you an Carol and your three wonderful kids . Having NIH interested in your disease is not a good sign . She need some friends and probably does nt have much time to make them ( you understand , cancer very serious ) You are one of the best I could offer . The fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small advantage at a time like this in her life . ( I could presume on Fr . Scott too but he has just retired and moved back to his hometown , Minnsota think ? ) I know you are busy , too many duties and demands already , but if I were in hospital with a bad prognosis I know you would be there for me , and if you visit this dear friend , I will consider it more precious to me than if I were the one being blessed by yourcom-any and suppor . Her name is Kerry Ellison from Australia but she lived in California for many years and is a U.S. citixen . Shell be arrive tomorrow . Shell foll you in about me and my current situati0n including why you havent hear from me in so long . I hope to come up and visit her and you to as soon as possle . I wanted to accompany her on the flight but as shell explain myown condition does nt permit right now ( not to worry ) . It extremely hard to get internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurance that you are in my prayers Daniel as is you family . No need respond as Im using Kerry 's account just this once and wont be able to check for your reply. - Neo ( Phil 1722 ) P.S. She arrives BWI American #1776 from Miami at 1122 p.m . Monday night and will take cab to hotel near NIH . She mets her doctors at NCI 9 am on Tuesday . It was a Sunday night , the evening air still warm and moist after a hazy , brutally hot , and humid Mid-Atlantic day . I was tired . For some reason though , I felt that I should check my e-mail before going to bed , something I normally avoid doing because it often keeps me up too late , and most things can be handled better the next morning anyway . I had just returned from leading the evening service at Potomac Community Church , where I serve as pastor . Those of you who have read the first account of my friendship with Dr. Neil Edward Oliver ( whose friends always address him by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine how my eyes widened and my heart began to race as I realized who had sent me this e-mail . I remember slowly lifting my hands from the keyboard as I read , as if I were being arrested or held up . I had n't heard from Neo since he left for a ' round-the-world voyage some eighteen months earlier , and had worried about him ( and prayed for him ) more and more as each month passed . Now , reading this message from him , I began asking myself a dozen questions about his whereabouts and well-being . ( His reference to his " condition " was disconcerting-I reread it several times . Also , Neo normally was as meticulous in his spelling and grammar as he was in his dress , so the flood of typos in the message told me that he was writing in extraordinary circumstances . ) The references to Miami and the islands made me think of the Bahamas , or some other Caribbean islands , and then ( of course ! ) , Jamaica-Neo 's place of birth . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carol , about this long-awaited contact from our friend , I had leapt from a hunch to a certainty : " Carol , Carol , wake up , " I said , " I just got an e-mail from Neo in Jamaica . " Carol is one of those Southern-born people who sounds sweet and acts civil even when she 's being torn from sleep . " Neo ... an e-mail ? Let me see , Dan ! " She hopped out of bed , grabbed a robe , and beat me upstairs to my attic office . " There 's nothing about Jamaica here that I can see , " she began , leaning toward the computer screen , " but we 'll have to set up the guest room for his friend . I reckon she must be terrified . Of course you 'll pick her up at the airport , right ? " Neo had n't expected us to put up his friend , but of course we would . After a night of little sleep for either Carol or me , and after a Monday that seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 11:00 P.M. , only to read " Delayed " on the screens that report the status of flights . At the American counter , I learned that the delay was due to tropical storm Chantal , twirling out in the Caribbean . The woman at the counter gave me my first doubt about my Jamaica theory as she explained that Flight 1776 was a continuing flight from Quito , Ecuador , with a stop in Miami . Ecuador ? I remembered wondering what " ec " stood for in the return address of Neo 's e-mail , and now at least I knew that piece of the puzzle . If you fly a lot , you know how these things go . It was 2:46 A.M. when Flight 1776 finally arrived . The last person off the plane was Kerry , being pushed in a wheelchair down the jetway and through the gate . Three things struck me immediately about Kerry . First , she was strikingly attractive . With her blue eyes , suntanned skin , and graying hair pulled back in a youthful ponytail , she reminded me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone I 'd seen in a National Geographic , that woman who worked with chimpanzees . ( Later , I remembered the name , Jane Goodall , and the resemblance was stronger the more I thought about it , though Kerry was a bit taller . ) Second , I could see on her face a dull tiredness or pain , even as she managed a smile at the attendant who was helping her to her feet and helping her get a bag over one shoulder and a cane into the other hand . She 'd smile , and then wince , and then smile again-then another wince as she assured the attendant that yes , she could walk , yes , she was fine , thank you for your help . Third , as she stood , I noticed-there 's no delicate way to say this-that she had no breasts . She wore jeans and a black T-shirt that revealed a chest as flat as any boy 's , and before I could fully process what that meant , I was shaking her hand and introducing myself . As she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could feel her ribs pressing against my chest . She started to cry . I felt her tears on my neck as she hugged me . " Neo told me you might be here , " she said , " but I did n't want to get my hopes up . Thank you so much for ... " For some reason , I started crying , too . Then came a flood of apologies that the plane was so late , and more thanks for picking her up , and questions about a good hotel , and assurances from me that Carol and I insisted she stay with us and consider our home her new home . She had no baggage beyond the carry-on bag that kept slipping off her shoulder . I took it and slung it over my shoulder . The attendant was watching all this from a few yards away , and he now returned and invited Kerry to sit back on the wheelchair , and she accepted . We left the gate , proceeded down the long concourse , past security , through the automatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendant again helped Kerry to her feet and said goodbye . The two of us slowly walked across the road to the parking garage , and we were home by 3:45 . She mentioned our mutual friend briefly on the way home . " I promised Neo I 'd give you a full report on how he 's been doing , Dan , but we 'll need a few hours for that . A few days would be more like it ! " Carol was still awake when we arrived , and she and Kerry met with a warm embrace . There was no question of any further conversation ; we needed to get Kerry to bed as soon as possible and save all talk for the next morning . But that was n't to be . The next morning , we faced the pressure of fighting Maryland traffic to get our new friend to Bethesda for her intake at the National Cancer Institute at 9:00 A.M. In fact , it was n't until that evening that Carol and I got a chance to talk with Kerry at length . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual stuff ( soccer practices , shopping ) , so I drove Kerry and then stayed at the hospital all day , waiting , reading magazines , doing a little work on my laptop , making a few calls on my mobile phone , visiting the candy machine a couple times in lieu of lunch . Carol joined me in the waiting room later in the afternoon . Kerry was almost finished with her tests , a nurse told us , and would be settled in her room by seven o'clock . Carol and I caught dinner in the cafeteria , and then cautiously entered Room 516 . Kerry , sitting up in bed , eating her hospital dinner , welcomed us in . " Quite a day , " she said , as we settled in the squeaky vinyl seats at the foot of her bed . " I ca n't imagine , " Carol said . And with that , the conversation began and flowed until visiting hours ended at nine o'clock . It was kind of strange , but kind of natural too-as if we were already long-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had immediate trust and warmth ; now all we needed was the facts , which Kerry offered . She was fifty-one , a biologist employed at the Charles Darwin Research Center in the Galapagos Islands , six hundred miles west of Ecuador . She had first been diagnosed with breast cancer five years earlier , back in California . She had undergone a bilateral radical mastectomy , along with an experimental form of chemotherapy , and had been free of cancer ever since-or so she thought until a few days earlier . Her first symptom of relapse had been a slight but nagging pain in her left leg , and then a few days later , while snorkeling in the ocean , she felt something erupt inside her armpit . " It was as if a golf ball suddenly popped through my muscle and bulged beneath my skin , " she said . " I could n't put my arm down normally , and right away , I knew I was in deep trouble . " She paused to glance at the IV tube hooked to her left forearm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she went on , leaving me wondering what kind of " we " she and Neo constituted . " The doctors in Quito talked to my oncologist in California , and they agreed that I needed care that I could n't receive in Ecuador . Then my oncologist contacted NCI , and because my cancer is a very rare one , they agreed that I should come here , and Neo contacted you , and so ... here I am . " In the back of my mind , I wanted to ask more about Neo , but with Kerry sitting there in her hospital gown , an IV dripping into her arm , it hardly seemed right to talk about anything else but her and her condition . She told us about the first day 's tests , and what she had been told to expect in the next several days . ( She 'd be getting some strong chemo , and her hair would be gone within a week , for starters . ) She was pleasant , and her accent was charming , and her eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winces . And the tiredness in her face was unmistakable . When it was nearing nine o'clock and I suggested we let her get some sleep , she did n't quarrel . She just said , " Well , after that tardy flight last night , you must be wiped out too . I 'm fine , and I 'll never forget your kindness to me . You could n't have been kinder . I feel bless- ... uh , fortunate indeed . " Her stumbling over the word " blessed " caught my attention-we pastors notice such things . Carol told her we 'd be back the next day . And we were . In fact , either Carol or I or both of us visited almost every day for the next few weeks , not because we had to , but because we wanted to . Soon enough , Kerry began telling us about her friendship with Neo , and the story that brought her to that bed in that room in that hospital that first evening . The chapters that follow recount her story . When Neo arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , met many of their mutual friends , I was able to supplement Kerry 's recollections with those from her wider circle of friends and fill out the narrative in much more detail . Her story , and theirs , became entwined in the fabric of an even larger story into which my own life and yours too are also woven . ( Continues ... )
