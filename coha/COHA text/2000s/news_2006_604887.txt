<p> PEORIA , Ariz.  --  Seattle Mariners catcher Kenji Johjima , who entered this country just six weeks ago , nodded and smiled when teammate Richie Sexson handed him a pen and a baseball . <p> Certainly , Johjima said , he would be delighted to give his autograph . It was quite an honor that Sexson , an eight-year veteran , would even ask . <p> " I 'm just a rookie , " said Johjima , 29 . <p> He removed the pen cap and started to scribble his name . Suddenly , he recoiled in horror . <p> The pen exploded . Ink flew everywhere . Johjima slapped at his face , believing he was on fire . He looked around . No language or culture barrier could misinterpret his teammates ' laughter . <p> Yep , they got him again . Johjima ( joe-jee-mah ) , the first Japanese catcher to reach the majors , was victimized by the old exploding pen trick . <p> Some days he shakes teammates ' hands and is greeted by an electric shock . Other days he finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And just wait until Mariners reliever Eddie Guardado , who calls him , " Joe Mama , " puts that itching powder in his underwear . <p> " It 's fun , because he 's not used to any of this , " says Sexson , the clubhouse prankster . " I ca n't believe he 's never seen an exploding pen . I figured they made those things in Japan . Once I assured him that his face was n't on fire , he was cool with it . " <p> Johjima , who for three months has been taking a crash course in English , laughed and said in perfect English : " It 's my turn next year . Just wait . I 'll get them all back . " <p> At a time when finding big-league catchers is at a premium , Johjima might indeed become his prankster teammates ' worst nightmare while tormenting the rest of the American League . He hit .299 in his 11 seasons in Japan 's Pacific League , averaging 30 homers and 87 RBI the last five . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , " says Chicago Cubs special assistant Gary Hughes , who scouted Johjima in Japan and at the 2004 Olympics in Athens . " He can do everything . He can catch . He can block balls . He can throw . He can hit . He can run . Really , he has no weakness . " <p> Remember the skepticism in November when the Mariners signed a catcher who did n't know a word of English to a three-year , $16.5million deal ? How could he possibly communicate with his pitchers ? How could he call pitches when he has never seen any of the opposing hitters ? <p> But the guy who wants to be called " Joe " has picked up the language as if he were born in Brooklyn . He takes English classes three times a week , two hours a day . When he speaks , you almost forget he grew up in Sasebo , Japan . <p> " That 's the most amazing thing of all , " says Howard Lincoln , the Mariners ' chairman and chief executive officer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure is teaching him how to do it right . " <p> Johjima does n't even look like he 's from the Far East , his teammates tell him . He looks more like a speedy outfielder than a slow-footed catcher with his 6-foot , 198-pound body . He has big brown eyes that dance mischievously . He smiles as if he understands every joke and insult . <p> " When I first met him , I said , " Come on , bro , you do n't look Japanese to me , ' " Guardado says . " ' You 're Mexican-ese . Come on , is your dad Mexican ? Is your mom ? Do n't be ashamed to say you 're a Mexican like me . ' " <p> Johjima 's reaction ? <p> " Oh , you are Eddie ? Is that really you ? " Johjima told him . " You look like a fat Mexican on TV . " <p> Adjusting quickly to a new atmosphere <p> Johjima , a six-time all-star and seven-time Gold Glove winner for the Fukuoka Softbank Hawks , is catching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USA until January for the Mariners ' introductory news conference . He had never conversed in English . Never had a Big Mac . Never watched an American movie . <p> " It 'll be difficult with the language barrier , but I think his personality will fit in and make it much easier , " says Chicago White Sox second baseman Tadahito Iguchi , Johjima 's teammate for eight years in Japan . " I have no worries about how Johjima will play . He 'll be a top-flight catcher . That 's why he wanted to come here , to see how we would do in the United States . We talked about that for years . <p> " His biggest problem will be the change of environment . Especially the food . Now that will take some getting used to . " <p> Johjima says : " The food is fine . We 're in America , right ? You eat American food . Besides , I like steak . " <p> Johjima has discovered The Cheesecake Factory in Seattle and a sushi restaurant . Sorry , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear that thousands of Japanese baseball fans will besiege him between bites . <p> Three dozen Japanese reporters and cameramen hound him each day . One morning , after signing autographs , he jumped into a golf cart and sped toward the clubhouse . <p> " I really believe he 'll turn out to be one of the all-time favorites for Mariners fans , " Lincoln says . " He has n't had the same impact as Ichiro ( Suzuki ) yet . Ichiro was already a superstar ( before coming to the Mariners ) . I never met anyone in any field that had as much confidence as he has . <p> " But Johjima is different . Ichiro is such a quiet guy . But this guy is so outgoing , so demonstrative . Fans are going to be intrigued by his personality , enthusiasm and his clear expression of joy . ... He 's going to draw people just to see him perform . " <p> Putting in plenty of study time <p> Johjima clearly was Japan 's finest catcher . Most remarkable was his durability . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he caught every inning of every game . <p> " I like to play , " Johjima says . " Why rest if you 're not tired ? I know it 'll be different in this country . " <p> Johjima , whose wife , Maki , is pregnant in Japan with their third child ( due in June ) , has devoted virtually every waking moment to becoming Americanized . <p> He studied videos of the Mariners pitchers before he arrived at spring training . He requested a private meeting with former Mariners catcher Dan Wilson in Seattle , spending an hour gaining insight on the whims of the pitching staff . Each day he catches a pitcher , he speaks with him for about 20 minutes , jotting observations in a notebook he carries with him . <p> Johjima might be the only man in baseball who wears a red catcher 's mitt  --  " Japanese style , " he told teammate Andy Dominique  --  but he is even altering his approach to look like an American catcher . He has greatly reduced his leg kick when hitting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back foot instead of releasing the ball the moment he catches it . <p> " The guy is a genius , " says Mariners pitcher Lindsay Gulin , who spent the past two years playing with Johjima . " There 's nothing he ca n't do . He 's just so smart . He was by far and away the best catcher offensively and defensively . He was the best leader . And he was the best competitor . He was the man over there . <p> " The guy is so talented that he was the best fisherman in Japan , too . He was always on the cover of all of these fishing magazines . He told me that if it was n't for baseball , he 'd be a professional fisherman . It does n't surprise me at all that he 's learning English so quickly . " <p> Downplays the language barrier <p> Johjima , who has two interpreters while Ichiro is playing in the World Baseball Classic , hardly even uses Ken Barron or Antony Suzuki . One day , Barron acts as an imaginary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy . Another day , Suzuki stands by and nods while Johjima answers the first few interview questions in perfect English . <p> " When we have our meetings in the morning , I do n't recall someone speaking to him in Japanese , which tells me he 's understanding what 's going on , " Moyer says . <p> Says bench coach Ron Hassey , who instructs Johjima and the catchers : " It 's actually pretty funny . In our meetings , he blows his interpreters off . He wants to do it himself . " <p> Johjima even found himself intently watching several players in a high-stakes poker game one day as if trying to learn every player 's tendencies . <p> " Come on over here , bro , we 'll take your yen , " Guardado said . <p> Johjima laughed and shook his head . Sorry , it was time for a workout and another round of English classes . No time to play just yet . <p> " The language barrier , as we 're finding out , was way overblown , " general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only one who was freaked about it . But by and large , there wo n't be any communication problems . " <p> There will be other obstacles along the way . Johjima has never seen the opposing hitters , so he 'll be relying on scouting reports and pitchers ' advice . There will also be times when his pitcher will become rattled on the mound , screaming obscenities and using phrases that Johjima has n't learned yet . <p> " That 's OK ; the guys are teaching me those curse words now , " Johjima says . " It 's funny . Even players over here know a lot of bad Japanese words . " <p> To complicate matters , the Mariners have four native Spanish-speaking pitchers along with backup catcher Rene Rivera . But for Johjima , it 's almost comforting to know he 's not alone in trying to master English . <p> " I learn English this year , " Johjima says , smiling proudly . " Next year , I 'll try picking up Spanish . Everything will be bueno . "
