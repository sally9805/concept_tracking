from // The Apple That Astonished Paris // ( 1988 ) // Another Reason Why I Don ? t Keep a Gun in the House // The neighbors ? dog will not stop barking . // He is barking the same high , rhythmic bark // that he barks every time they leave the house . // They must switch him on on their way out . // The neighbors ? dog will not stop barking . // I close all the windows in the house // and put on a Beethoven symphony full blast // but I can still hear him muffled under the music , // barking , barking , barking , // and now I can see him sitting in the orchestra , // his head raised confidently as if Beethoven // had included a part for barking dog . // When the record finally ends he is still barking , // sitting there in the oboe section barking , // his eyes fixed on the conductor who is // entreating him with his baton // while the other musicians listen in respectful // silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coda that first established // Beethoven as an innovative genius . Walking Across the Atlantic // I wait for the holiday crowd to clear the beach // before stepping onto the first wave . // Soon I am walking across the Atlantic // thinking about Spain , // checking for whales , waterspouts. // I feel the water holding up my shifting weight . // Tonight I will sleep on its rocking surface . // But for now I try to imagine what // this must look like to the fish below , // the bottoms of my feet appearing , disappearing . Plight of the Troubadour // For a good hour I have been singing lays // in langue d ? oc to a woman who knows // only langue d ? o ? l , an odd Picard dialect // at that . // The European love lyric is flourishing // with every tremor of my voice , // yet a friend has had to tap my shoulder // to tell me she has not caught a word . // My sentiments are tangled like kites // in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lost in an anthology // and poets will no longer wear hats like mine . // Provence will be nothing more // than a pink hue on a map or an answer on a test . // And still the woman smiles over at me // feigning this look of sisterly understanding . The Lesson // In the morning when I found History // snoring heavily on the couch , // I took down his overcoat from the rack // and placed its weight over my shoulder blades . // It would protect me on the cold walk // into the village for milk and the paper // and I figured he would not mind , // not after our long conversation the night before . // How unexpected his blustering anger // when I returned covered with icicles , // the way he rummaged through the huge pockets // making sure no major battle or English queen // had fallen out and become lost in the deep snow . Winter Syntax // A sentence starts out like a lone traveler // heading into a blizzard at midnight , // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , // the tails of his thin coat flapping behind him . // There are easier ways of making sense , // the connoisseurship of gesture , for example . // You hold a girl ? s face in your hands like a vase . // You lift a gun from the glove compartment // and toss it out the window into the desert heat . // These cool moments are blazing with silence . // The full moon makes sense . When a cloud crosses it // it becomes as eloquent as a bicycle leaning // outside a drugstore or a dog who sleeps all afternoon // in a corner of the couch . // Bare branches in winter are a form of writing . // The unclothed body is autobiography . // Every lake is a vowel , every island a noun . // But the traveler persists in his misery , // struggling all night through the deepening snow , // leaving a faint alphabet of bootprints // on the white hills and the white floors of valleys , // a message for field mice and passing crows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke // rising from your chimney , and when he stands // before you shivering , draped in sparkling frost , // a smile will appear in the beard of icicles , // and the man will express a complete thought . Advice to Writers // Even if it keeps you up all night , // wash down the walls and scrub the floor // of your study before composing a syllable . // Clean the place as if the Pope were on his way . // Spotlessness is the niece of inspiration . // The more you clean , the more brilliant // your writing will be , so do not hesitate to take // to the open fields to scour the undersides // of rocks or swab in the dark forest // upper branches , nests full of eggs . // When you find your way back home // and stow the sponges and brushes under the sink , // you will behold in the light of dawn // the immaculate altar of your desk , // a clean surface in the middle of a clean world . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yellow pencil , the sharpest of the bouquet , // and cover pages with tiny sentences // like long rows of devoted ants // that followed you in from the woods . The Rival Poet // The column of your book titles , // always introducing your latest one , // looms over me like Roman architecture . // It is longer than the name // of an Italian countess , longer // than this poem will probably be . // Etched on the head of a pin , // my own production would leave room for // The Lord ? s Prayer and many dancing angels . // No matter . // In my revenge daydream I am the one // poised on the marble staircase // high above the crowded ballroom . // A retainer in livery announces me // and the Contessa Maria Teresa Isabella // Veronica Multalire Eleganza de Bella Ferrari . // You are the one below // fidgeting in your rented tux // with some local Cindy hanging all over you . Insomnia // After counting all the sheep in the world // I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. , // then I add up all the zoos and aquariums , // country by country . // By early light I am asleep // in a nightmare about drowning in the Flood , // yelling across the rising water // at preoccupied Noah as his wondrous // ark sails by and begins to grow smaller . // Now a silhouette on the horizon , // the only boat on earth is disappearing . // As I rise and fall on the rocking waves , // I concentrate on the giraffe couple , // their necks craning over the roof , // to keep my life from flashing before me. // After all the animals wink out of sight // I float on my back , eyes closed . // I picture all the fish in creation // leaping a fence in a field of water , // tell you how much you // would weigh on other planets . // You have noticed the fat ones // lingering on the Mars scale // and the emaciated slowing up // the line for Neptune . // As a creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attraction . // Imagine squatting in the wasteland // of Pluto , all five tons of you , // or wandering around Mercury // wondering what to do next with your ounce . // How much better to step onto // the simple bathroom scale , // a happy earthling feeling // the familiar ropes of gravity , // 157 pounds standing soaking wet // a respectful distance from the sun . Books // From the heart of this dark , evacuated campus // I can hear the library humming in the night , // a choir of authors murmuring inside their books // along the unlit , alphabetical shelves , // Giovanni Pontano next to Pope , Dumas next to his son , // each one stitched into his own private coat , // together forming a low , gigantic chord of language . // I picture a figure in the act of reading , // shoes on a desk , head tilted into the wind of a book , // a man in two worlds , holding the rope of his tie // as the suicide of lovers saturates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of a theorem . // He moves from paragraph to paragraph // as if touring a house of endless , paneled rooms . // I hear the voice of my mother reading to me // from a chair facing the bed , books about horses and dogs , // and inside her voice lie other distant sounds , // the horrors of a stable ablaze in the night , // a bark that is moving toward the brink of speech . // I watch myself building bookshelves in college , // walls within walls , as rain soaks New England , // or standing in a bookstore in a trench coat . // I see all of us reading ourselves away from ourselves , // straining in circles of light to find more light // until the line of words becomes a trail of crumbs // that we follow across a page of fresh snow ; when evening is shadowing the forest // and small birds flutter down to consume the crumbs , // we have to listen hard to hear the voices // of the boy and his sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with universal saloon practice , // the clock here is set fifteen minutes ahead // of all the clocks in the outside world . // This makes us a rather advanced group , // doing our drinking in the unknown future , // immune from the cares of the present , // safely harbored a quarter of an hour // beyond the woes of the contemporary scene . // No wonder such thoughtless pleasure derives // from tending the small fire of a cigarette , // from observing this glass of whiskey and ice , // the cold rust I am sipping , // or from having an eye on the street outside // when Ordinary Time slouches past in a topcoat , // rain running off the brim of his hat , // the late edition like a flag in his pocket . My Number // Is Death miles away from this house , // reaching for a widow in Cincinnati // or breathing down the neck of a lost hiker // in British Columbia ? // Is he too busy making arrangements , // tampering with air brakes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden beams of roller coasters // to bother with my hidden cottage // that visitors find so hard to find ? // Or is he stepping from a black car // parked at the dark end of the lane , // shaking open the familiar cloak , // its hood raised like the head of a crow , // and removing the scythe from the trunk ? // Did you have any trouble with the directions ? // I will ask , as I start talking my way out of this . Introduction to Poetry // I ask them to take a poem // and hold it up to the light // like a color slide // or press an ear against its hive . // I say drop a mouse into a poem // and watch him probe his way out , // or walk inside the poem ? s room // and feel the walls for a light switch . // I want them to water-ski // across the surface of a poem // waving at the author ? s name on the shore . // But all they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair with rope // and torture a confession out of it . // They begin beating it with a hose // to find out what it really means . The Brooklyn Museum of Art // I will now step over the soft velvet rope // and walk directly into this massive Hudson River // painting and pick my way along the Palisades // with this stick I snapped off a dead tree . // I will skirt the smoky , nestled towns // and seek the path that leads always outward // until I become lost , without a hope // of ever finding the way back to the museum . // I will stand on the bluffs in nineteenth-century clothes , // a dwarf among rock , hills , and flowing water , // and I will fish from the banks in a straw hat // which will feel like a brush stroke on my head . // And I will hide in the green covers of forests // so no appreciator of Frederick Edwin Church , // leaning over the soft velvet rope , // will spot my tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing for the others to see , // and be thought mad and led away to a cell // where there is no vaulting landscape to explore , // none of this birdsong that halts me in my tracks , // and no wide curving of this river that draws // my steps toward the misty vanishing point . Schoolsville // Glancing over my shoulder at the past , // I realize the number of students I have taught // is enough to populate a small town . // I can see it nestled in a paper landscape , // chalk dust flurrying down in winter , // nights dark as a blackboard. // The population ages but never graduates . // On hot afternoons they sweat the final in the park // and when it ? s cold they shiver around stoves // reading disorganized essays out loud . // A bell rings on the hour and everybody zigzags // into the streets with their books . // I forgot all their last names first and their // first names last in alphabetical order . // But the boy who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owns the haberdashery. // The girl who signed her papers in lipstick // leans against the drugstore , smoking , // brushing her hair like a machine . // Their grades are sewn into their clothes // like references to Hawthorne . // The A ? s stroll along with other A ? s. // The D ? s honk whenever they pass another D. // All the creative-writing students recline // on the courthouse lawn and play the lute . // Wherever they go , they form a big circle . // Needless to say , I am the mayor . // I live in the white colonial at Maple and Main . // I rarely leave the house . The car deflates // in the driveway . Vines twirl around the porch swing . // Once in a while a student knocks on the door // with a term paper fifteen years late // or a question about Yeats or double-spacing. // And sometimes one will appear in a windowpane // to watch me lecturing the wallpaper , // quizzing the chandelier , reprimanding the air . //  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
