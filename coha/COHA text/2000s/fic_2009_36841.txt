Killdeer Ridge Ranch <p> Before sunrise , Marik drove her father 's old truck along the white gravel service road that wound up the ridge to the giant windmills . Dust funneled up behind the pickup 's tires , and a chilly wind gusted through the passenger window , stuck permanently halfway open . The pickup 's heater poured warm air on her boots . A preseason thunderstorm had blown through the night before , with plenty of bluster but only a spattering of rain . Spring was weeks away . <p> She took it slow over a patch of graded ruts , coffee sloshing against the lid of its thermal mug in the console , the arthritic joints of the pickup creaking . Her dad had named the truck Red Ryder , after an old-time hero of cowboy comics . Every time she climbed into the cab to make her morning rounds on the ranch , she caught her father 's scent , though he 'd been gone nearly two years . <p> She was nearing the apex of the ridge where she stopped every morning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley . Against a blue-gray sky , forty-five giant wind turbines towered above the horizon , catching the first rays of sun in their long white arms . Below them the earth waited in shadow . <p> The first time she 'd seen windmills like these at the White Deer facility in West Texas , their stark beauty and clean design had stopped her breath . Their slow , rhythmic turning sounded like a heartbeat , the mystical pulse of the earth itself . Regardless of storms or heat , the white giants stood inscrutable , heads turned to the wind . These forty-five turbines produced enough electricity to power nearly a million homes , and this was only phase one of the wind farm . <p> Marik parked Red Ryder at her usual spot on the highest point of the ridge . That 's when she saw it  --  a dark mass on the rocky ground , something that did n't belong . It lay at the foot of Windmill 17 , where the service road wound back on itself before disappearing behind the low hill . <p> She leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . The blackish mound was about the size of a newborn calf , nearly hidden by last season 's sagebrush and dried yucca . But it could n't be a calf ; the cattle were in the lower fields now , on winter-wheat pasture . Maybe a runaway trash bag that blew up here in the night ? But it looked too solid for a trash bag , and heavy . <p> It was n't moving with the wind . She had the sinking impression that whatever it was , it had once been a living thing . <p> She searched the dusty floorboard for the binocular case . The binocs , too , had been her dad 's . She could see his calloused hands on the metal when she removed the beat-up glasses and got out of the truck . Wind whipped her ponytail and the loose ends stung her eyes . Should have brought a stocking cap . It was always cooler up here than in the ranch yard , where the ground was flat and trees sheltered the buildings . She zipped her jacket and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her elbows on top of the cab . <p> The sun had breached the horizon now , and the slim rotors of the windmills cast moving shadows across the land . Next month wild verbena and prairie daisies would thrust up from the rocky soil . But in February the ridge was a tonal study in pale gold and shades of russet brown . She liked to paint it that way , but those paintings were hard to sell . Buyers wanted more color . <p> She held the binoculars to her eyes and searched the landscape for the alien object . Low brush and shadows obstructed her view , and the lenses of the old binocs were fogged with scratches . She tossed the field glasses on the truck seat and walked down the service road toward number 17 . <p> Gravel crunched beneath her boots . The only other sound was the unhurried soughing of the windmills . <p> An immense canopy of sky arched cloudless from horizon to horizon . Severe clear , her pilot father would have said . It was the kind of day her grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a long , cold winter . Soon when she walked here she 'd have to watch for killdeer eggs at the edge of the road , the speckled eggs perfectly camouflaged among the rocks . <p> When she drew closer to the dark object lying in the scrub growth , she saw the wind ruffle its edges  --  like feathers . Her chest closed up . Please , not an eagle . But no other bird would be that large . She left the roadbed and crossed open ground , stepping over clumps of dried timothy and prickly-pear cactus . Another few feet and she stood over the fallen bird . Damn . <p> Her artist 's eye cataloged the mottled colors  --  burnt umber , sienna , Payne 's grey . Highlights of gold oak . A golden eagle , she thought , though she 'd never seen one this close . She crouched beside it . <p> The head was bent beneath its body . One wing lay unfurled and obviously broken . Even inert , the hooked talons looked macabre . Those claws could seize a slippery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small animal to feed the eagle 's young . She touched the bird with the toe of her boot , hoping for movement and a chance for rescue . There was none . The body felt stiff . <p> From a distant pasture a bull claimed his territory with a wheezy bellow . Above her head , the windmill blades kept up their leisurely whough , whough , whough , whough . She looked up at the turning rotors . The carcass lay right below them , no more than twenty-five feet from the tower base , as if the eagle had simply dropped from the sky . The fiberglass rotors appeared to turn slowly , but that was an optical illusion . Each hollow blade was more than a hundred feet long . The tips of the blades could reach 156 miles per hour and still look slow to the human eye . <p> Was it possible the eagle had flown into one ? She could n't imagine that . Eagles ' eyesight was legendary ; they spotted prey on the ground or in the water from hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the dead eagle , that 's exactly what they 'd claim  --  that the bird had been killed by the blades . Burt and Lena Gurdman had objected to the wind farm from the beginning and had delayed construction of the first phase with their complaints . Folks around here were stoutly protective of the migratory birds that wintered along the river , and Marik had no doubt Burt Gurdman would use the eagle 's death as ammunition for another battle . <p> The dark feathers glistened in angled sunlight . The bird 's wingspan must be seven feet , at least . Even dead it looked beautiful and strong and utterly wild . Carefully , she rolled it over . Thank God it did n't have a white head . She was fairly sure bald eagles were still on the endangered-species list , though the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had recommended delisting several years ago . <p> She ran her fingers over the satiny breast feathers . " What happened to you , big brother ? I wish you could tell me . " <p> The coming furor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was illegal to be in possession of an eagle feather , let alone an entire animal . If he could , Gurdman would use this new argument to stop construction of the last twenty-five wind towers . <p> Do n't borrow the jack before the tire 's flat . It was her father 's voice , clear as ever in her head . His easygoing ways had endeared him to everyone but had also led the ranch into deep debt . She 'd had no idea how deep until his sudden death . <p> Marik laid an arm across her forehead , shading her eyes from a brilliant sunrise . Her gaze traveled down the slope and across the wide fields near the river . <p> She saw three choices . She could turn the bird over to a county official or wildlife ranger and meet the consequences head-on . Or she could haul the eagle to the river , let it be found in its usual habitat  --  but on the opposite bank that was part of the state wildlife preserve . Not on her ranch . <p> Or she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> All three options stunk . But when she thought of the impending brouhaha over the eagle 's death , it was damn tempting to go home and get her shovel . <p> Her battle of conscience dissolved with the growl of tires on gravel . Somebody was coming . The sound drifted to her across the ridge before she spotted the vehicle winding through the switchbacks and up the rise . <p> Double damn . <p> Marik straightened her spine and stood beneath the giant turbines , facing into the wind . Waiting for trouble . <p> A white pickup tacked toward her at a leisurely pace . She had not closed the gate at the main road and , despite the No Trespassing signs , the driver apparently took the open gate as an invitation . The men who tended the windmills drove white pickups , but she could already see this one was a stretch cab and the power company 's gold logo was n't painted on the door . None of the neighboring ranchers drove a truck like that , either . <p> She lost sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again on the high ridge . The truck stopped beside Red Ryder and a tall , lean man got out . He wore jeans and low-heeled boots with a quilted vest over his long-sleeved shirt . She did n't know him . He clamped a wide-brimmed hat on his head and started down the slope toward her with a rolling stride . <p> His face looked friendly enough until he saw the mound of feathers at her feet . When his eyes fixed on the eagle , all hints of a smile faded away . He did n't speak as he approached but knelt immediately and put his hands on the bird , turning it over , spreading out the feathers on the underside of the tail . <p> " Bad news , " he said . " It 's a bald eagle . " <p> He looked up at her with gold-ochre eyes . She frowned . " There 's no white head . " <p> " It 's a young one . They do n't get the distinctive white feathers on the head and tip of the tail until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How do you know it 's not a golden ? " she said , still hoping . <p> " The feet , for one thing . Golden eagles have feathers all the way to the claws . This one does n't . And see that grayish color of the feathers on the underside of the tail ? That 's distinctive to a young bald eagle . A golden would have white on the tail , up next to the body . " <p> " It 's sure big to be immature . " <p> " Probably a female . They get larger than males . I 'd guess it 's two or three years old . " <p> Perfect . Not just an eagle ; it 's the freaking national symbol . <p> The stranger looked younger than she was , early twenties maybe , except for those case-hardened eyes . " You talk like a biologist , " she said . <p> " Not exactly . But I majored in it , along with land management . I'mJace Rainwater , your nine o'clock appointment . " <p> He brushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she guessed , even without the big hat . He paused as if waiting for her to introduce herself or offer a handshake . She did neither . She was supposed to interview him about the foreman 's job  --  two hours from now . Nowadays people called it ranch manager , but she figured if foreman was a good enough title for Monte , her dad 's old friend , it was good enough for whomever she hired . <p> " Sorry to be so early , " he said . " I drove from Amarillo and made better time than I expected . " <p> " You must have left in the dead of night to get here by sunrise . " <p> He offered no explanation . Maybe he awoke hours before daylight the way she did , worming over the things she could change and the ones she could n't . <p> " There was nobody around down there , " he said , gesturing toward the cluster of ranch buildings at the foot of the ridge , " so when I saw the truck up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She glanced at the eagle again . " Early would be a good trait for a ranch hand , any morning but this one . " <p> " At least the eagle 's a young one , probably not half of a breeding pair , " he offered . <p> She blew out a breath , looking across the fields to the west where the Gurdmans ' farm abutted her land . " My neighbors wo n't care how old the bird is when they try to block construction on the other windmills . " <p> " Your neighbors object to the wind farm ? " <p> " Those do . " <p> He followed her gaze toward a distant clump of trees where the glint of a white farmhouse reflected the early sun . " What for ? It 's pollution-free energy and it 's quiet . Cattle can graze right under the turbines . " <p> " Exactly . But the windmills might emit harmful rays that cause cancer and birth defects . " <p> " Good grief . " <p> " Not to mention that the Gurdmans missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Light . The company wanted only this high ground that 's not sheltered from the wind . " <p> " Ah , " he said . " So it 's about money . " <p> " That 's what I think , but they wo n't admit it . All the farms and ranches out here are struggling financially . The wind farm bailed me out , and the Gurdmans resent me for it . And now , of course , they can say the windmills kill eagles . " <br> Continues ...
