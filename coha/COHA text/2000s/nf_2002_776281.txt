THE EVERYDAY LIVES OF CHILDREN : Normal Social Pain // Every morning when the buses pull up in front of an elementary , // middle , or high school building , an extraordinary // social drama unfolds . Most adults miss the importance // of this opening act of the school day , because it is a daily theater , // apparently so predictable that grown-ups are not alert // to its intensity . But kids get off the bus with their minds // geared not to Spanish , spelling , or computer class , but to // seeing their friends . They 're ready for the curtain to rise on // the action of the day  --  for the conflict and connection of social // life . // Children suffer when they are teased or excluded or // have a fight with a friend  --  and parents suffer emphatically // right along with them . Our job is to bear that pain and // also to put it in perspective . After all , we lived through // cliques and betrayals and heartaches , and our children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can do to ease the pain  --  // theirs and ours  --  but our first job is to take a deep breath and // trust in children 's resilience and in the process of human // development . // The social troubles children face are so predictable and // inevitable that it is hard to call them traumas . Nevertheless , // they do hurt and they do sap a child 's confidence . Losing a // friend , having a secret betrayed , and being teased are just a // few examples . As parents , we want desperately to help children // escape these hard lessons of life , or at least master them // when they do happen . We know that lectures do n't really // work , but we keep giving them anyway , just in case . We // are n't sure what else to do . We also know that our own endless // worrying does n't help , but we have a hard time turning // it off . // Research shows that the majority of kids fall somewhere // in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from basically accepted to well liked to wildly popular . For // these children , intense social issues ( and pain ) are still prevalent . // In fact , pressures and conflicts are universal as kids // deal with clashes among the individual , the friendship pair , // and the group . Most of the answers to the questions in this // section begin with reassurance . Our goal is to help adults // understand such factors as temperament , group dynamics , // and child development . Our hope is that a better understanding // of these things will provide some perspective , a // dose of optimism , and a little relief from the anxiety we feel . // Parents and other adults all have their own painful memories // of social struggles . These memories are triggered when children // hand over their pain to their parents . It 's hard to separate // the new pain of your child 's present from the old pain of // your own school days . It 's a bit like getting your toe stepped // on when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you worry about as " normal " // social pain , we do not in any way mean to trivialize it . // The pain we feel when we lose a loved one is universal too  --  // and therefore " normal . " But that does not lessen its sting . In // fact , knowing that something is universal , that you and your // child are not the only people who ever went through this // pain , can be powerfully comforting . // If you read between the lines as you look over the questions // in this section , you 'll see that more often than not , what // parents and teachers are really asking is this : " Is my child // normal ? " " Are the children in my class normal ? " There is // often a great deal of anxiety and concern behind these questions . // Much uncertainty and anxiety comes from a lack of // experience about how normal it is for children to be in pain , // or how normal it is for children to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle . Normal children are not wonderful // every minute . Their friendships are n't always a scene on // a Hallmark card . In fact , they throw us all kinds of curve // balls . I often share with parents this quote from the brilliant // child psychiatrist D. W. Winnicott in his book The Child , // The Family , and the Outside World , " What is the normal // child like ? Does he just eat and grow and smile sweetly ? No , // that is not what he is like . A normal child , if he has confidence // in his father and mother , pulls out all the stops . In the // course of time he tries out his power to disrupt , to destroy , to // frighten , to wear down , to waste , to wangle and to appropriate . // Everything that takes people to the courts ( or to the asylums , // for that matter ) has its normal equivalent in infancy // and early childhood ( and in adolescence ) , in the relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home can stand up to all // the child can do to disrupt it , he settles down to play ; but // business first , the tests must be made . " // We have to bear the pain that our children share with us , // pain that might break our hearts or annoy us or remind us of // our own horrible peer experiences . And we have to keep a // sense of perspective about all that pain . Indeed , the first rule // of worrying as a parent is to take the long view . // There is a story about an anxious first-time mother // who called her baby 's pediatrician constantly , sometimes // several times a day . After a couple of months of this , he asked // to see her . This is what he said : " Mrs. Smith , you have given // birth to a child . You have opened yourself up to a lifetime // of worry . You have to pace yourself . " Kids , too , need // to learn to pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // In the first of the two case studies that follow , you will // meet a mother who learned to manage her worry and to promote , // rather than anguish about , her child 's friendships. // The second case study in this section will introduce you // to Karen , a young adult , and her reflections about the complex // interplay of identity , friendship , and popularity during // adolescence . Karen 's ability to look back on her own social // life helps her make sense of a struggle that was hard to // understand when she was living through it . We hope her // view will give you added perspective on your own children 's // experiences in the world of friendship and popularity . //
