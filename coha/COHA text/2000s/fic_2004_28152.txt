Chapter One Joey Gallagher bounced up and down on the balls of his feet . He pounded his mitt with his right fist and stared in toward home plate from deep center field , ready to catch the ball that came his way . Nicky Canelo , the Marlins pitcher , reared back and fired the ball so hard that he went airborne for a second . The Oriole batter , with his bright-orange helmet , swung a second too late . The ball smacked into the catcher 's mitt , sending up a cloud of powdery dust . The batter fell to his knees in a twisted , frustrated heap . " Stee-rike two ! " the umpire yelled . Parents clapped and yelled on both sides of the field . Joey bounced up and down on the balls of his feet some more and looked around him . In left field , Huey Brewster had his glove hand on his hip . Ellis Suggs , in right , was digging a hole in the outfield grass with his cleats . " What is he doing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither of the other two outfielders looked prepared . And why should they be ? None of the Orioles was going to hit Nicky Canelo 's fastball . Nobody ever did . Still , it was important to be ready . Joey shook his head and turned his attention back toward the plate . Nicky went into his windup and fired another unhittable blur . " Stee-rike three ! Yer out ! " theumpire said with gusto . It was impossible not to appreciate Nicky 's awesome talent , even if umpires were n't supposed to take sides . The batter threw down his bat in disgust and marched back to the bench . Nicky Canelo stepped off the mound , all six-foot-one of him . He whirled his pitching arm round and round like a windmill , keeping it loose . Too bad league rules did n't let teams use one pitcher all the time . The Marlins could use Nicky only for three innings per six-inning game . The first three innings ... well , those were the Marlins ' biggest problem . Starter Matt Lowe was pretty accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marlins could only hope to stay close till Nicky took the mound in the fourth inning . If they were ahead by then , it was curtains for the other team . Like today . They were up , 2-0 , with two outs in the bottom of the fourth inning . One more batter - then two more innings - and the Marlins would be 4-0 . A perfect record . Sure , the season was young , and a lot could still happen , but so far Coach Joe Bacino had come up with the perfect formula for success . " Hang on for three , then bring on Nick-eee ! " Three wins , no losses . And the last three innings of each game , with Nicky on the mound , had been mad boring for all the Marlins fielders . Nobody got any action except Pete Alessandra , the catcher . Joey had lots of time to think out there in center field . He thought about last year , in sixth grade , when he 'd pitched and played shortstop for the Mets . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Marlins were eighth graders , much bigger than he was . Joey felt lucky - at least he got to play most of every game . The other seventh graders usually rode the bench till " Nicky time " and never saw any balls hit to them at all . Still , Joey kept bouncing . " Got ta stay ready . Never know when you 're gon na get your big chance , " he muttered under his breath . The next hitter came up for the Orioles . It was their " big bat , " Andy Norton . Joey was friends with him , sort of - they were both seventh graders , and they had history , English , and gym together . Joey knew that Andy was leading the league in home runs because Andy never missed the chance to brag about it . Joey could n't wait to see Nicky Canelo strike him out . " Keep on bouncin ' , keep on bouncin ' , " he sang softly to himself . " Got ta stay ready . Never know when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like anyone was ever gon na hit Nicky ... And then , in an instant , everything changed . Andy Norton squeezed his eyes shut and swung . SMACK ! The bat hit the ball dead on . It rocketed toward the mound , where it hit Nicky right in the pitching arm . There was a sickening sound on impact , and the ball ricocheted all the way to first base . Charlie Morganstern picked it up and stepped on the bag to end the inning , but no one was watching - not even the umpire . Everyone was crowding around the mound , where Nicky Canelo had fallen in a heap . Joey could hear Coach Bacino yelling for someone to call 911 and asking if there was a doctor in the stands . Joey was so surprised that someone had hit the ball that it was a full ten seconds before he raced toward the mound . He got there just in time to see Nicky being helped to his feet . The Marlins ' star pitcher was sobbing , grabbing his arm with his glove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if a kid like Nicky Canelo was crying . They walked him over to the bench and put a cold pad on the spot where the ball had hit . Nicky was calmer now , but you could still see him sniffing back tears . Sirens sounded in the distance . Joey edged closer . Now he could see the ugly , swollen , purple bruise on Nicky 's upper arm . " He can make a fist and bend the elbow , " said one of the parents . " That 's a good sign , but he 'll still have to get x-rayed to make sure nothing 's broken . " Nicky 's teammates clapped for him as Coach Bacino led him to the ambulance . Everyone wished him good luck at the hospital . " I 'll be okay , " he assured them bravely . " Hey , you guys - win this one for me , okay ? " They all promised to do just that . But how ? They were only up by two runs , and Matt Lowe had already pitched his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch the next two innings ? " Coach Bacino asked his team as they gathered around the bench . A sea of willing but incapable hands went up . Joey stuck his hand up , too . Coach Bacino stroked the little beard on his chin and squinted , looking doubtfully down the line of them . His eyes came to rest on Joey . " Gallagher , " he said . " Did n't you say you used to pitch last year ? " " Uh-huh , " Joey said . " Okay , you 're it . " Coach Bacino put the ball in Joey 's mitt and squeezed it with both his hands . " Just get it over the plate . It 's okay if they hit it . That 's what your fielders are for . " Joey nodded and swallowed hard . He rubbed up the ball and tried to remember how he used to pitch way back in the old days , last year . Then he started warming up his arm , soft-tossing the ball to Pete on the sidelines . The Marlins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was time to get out on the mound . Funny , but the minute he got up there , he did n't feel nervous anymore . His team had a two-run lead , did n't they ? Besides , he felt like he could n't lose , no matter what happened . If he pitched badly and they lost , he had the perfect excuse : " Hey , I was n't prepared , " he could say . " I did n't have any practice . " On the other hand , if he had the least bit of success up there ... He focused in on Pete Alessandra 's great-big catcher 's mitt , reared back , and threw . The hitter swung hard , popped it up , and Charlie Morganstern caught the ball in foul territory . One out already - on only one pitch ! Joey drank in his teammates ' cheers . They were behind him all the way . He could feel it . He bore down on the next hitter and threw another meatball , right over home plate . THWACK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been Nicky pitching , Ellis Suggs would 've been caught napping , digging holes with his cleats in the outfield grass . But because Joey Nobody was on the mound , everyone was ready for anything . Suggs got his carcass moving just in time to make a diving play on the liner , and there were two out . " All right ! " Joey yelled , totally pumped now . If Ellis Suggs could make a play like that , then surely he , Joey Gallagher , could get four more batters out . He threw a change-up on the first pitch to the next hitter and caught the overanxious Oriole off guard . Swinging too soon , he popped up to Joey , and the inning was over . Joey could scarcely believe it . Three outs on three pitches - and this was in the seventh-/eighth-grade league ! Quickly he contained his urge to celebrate . There was still one more inning to go . He walked to the bench , barely acknowledging his teammates ' cheers and backslaps . The Marlins again went down quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . Even if they lost today , they 'd still be in second place to the Marlins . Their number-one pitcher was still out there , and while he was no Nicky Canelo , he was still pretty tough to hit . Joey got back on the mound and blew out a big , deep breath . This was it . This could be his day of glory-to remember forever . All he had to do was get three outs before the Orioles scored two runs . The first batter fouled off six pitches and finally worked out a walk . The next batter lined a sharp single up the middle . The runner on first put on the gas . Before Joey knew what had hit him , there were Orioles on first and third , with the top of the order coming up , and he still needed three outs ! Coach Bacino trotted out to talk to him . " You okay , kid ? " he asked . " I 'm okay . " " Are you gon na get this next guy out ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " " I 'm uh ... I 'm gon na make him hit it , " Joey said , remembering . " That 's right . You ca n't get three outs at once . Just get ' em one at a time . And never mind that run on third base . It means nothing . Just throw it over the plate . We do n't want Alessandra digging pitches out of the dirt . Next thing you know , the guy on first is stealing second and getting in scoring position . So throw some strikes . Okay ? " " Okay . " " Go get ' em . " Joey blew out another big breath . He stared at Pete 's catcher 's mitt and threw a really slow changeup . The hitter 's eyes nearly popped out of his head as he swung , but he was way too early . The ball was only halfway to the plate . He 'd finished his swing completely before it even hit the catcher 's mitt . " Stee-rike one ! " the umpire yelled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batter called to him . " Yeah ? " Joey yelled back . " You want another one ? " He reared back and threw as hard and high as he dared . The batter , taken totally by surprise , swung at air again . " Stee-rike two ! " the umpire said . " All right , " the batter said , spitting in the dirt . " You 're dead meat now . " He waggled his bat over his shoulder . Now Joey threw him the second change-up he 'd promised him , and this one was even slower than the first . The batter started his swing , then stopped it midway when he realized what was coming . He tried to restart his swing , but there was so little force left behind it that he hit a soft grounder right back to the mound . Joey grabbed it , turned , and threw to second . Shortstop Jordan Halpin took the throw , stepped on the bag ahead of the runner , then threw to first in plenty of time for the double play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mitt high in the air . The game was n't over yet , though , and the runner on third had scored to make it a 2-1 game . Still , the bases were empty , and if he got this batter out , or even the next one , he would n't have to face Andy Norton . Joey went after the hitter , throwing nothing but fastballs . On the third one , the Oriole hit a harmless grounder to Charlie Morganstern , who stepped on the bag to end the game . Sweet . " We won ! We won ! I ca n't believe it ! We won ! " all the Marlins shouted . They mobbed Joey at the mound , picked him up , and marched him around the infield on their shoulders - Joey the Hero . Yes , the short , skinny kid with the freckles , the puny seventh grader who put it to the Orioles when Nicky Canelo went down . It was only one day in his life , but try as he might , Joey could not remember a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward . " Okay , guys , this was a great victory , " he said as he put away the team 's equipment . " But we 've got a lot of baseball to play yet this season , and we may be without Nicky for a lot of it - maybe all of it . For now , Gallagher 's our second pitcher . " A big round of applause greeted this news . " If we all keep playing like this , we 'll still make the play-offs . Let 's do it for Nicky ! " Everyone cheered , exchanged high fives , then ran toward the line of cars that was waiting at the curb . Joey , still practically floating , headed for his mom 's old bomb of a station wagon . Wait till he told her what happened ! " Hi , Mom ! " he said , hurtling himself into the seat beside her . " Hi , honey ! " she said , giving him a quick hug and kiss . " Guess what ? " " Um , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey , Mom , I just - " " The papers came through , Joey ! " " The papers ? " " Yes , is n't that exciting ? We 're picking up your new brother next week ! " ( Continues ... )
