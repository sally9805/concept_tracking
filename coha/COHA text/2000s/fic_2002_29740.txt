Nora Bonesteel had not seen him for years . More than a decade ago John Walker quit his one-man law practice , and he and his wife Luanne had left the Tennessee mountains to retire in a tiny lakeside cottage in western North Carolina , where John had declared his intention to divide the rest of his days between fishing and playing bridge . Since he did n't like people much , his ties to the community did not particularly concern him . His fellow bridge players and other new acquaintances saw John as a genial old fellow with an endless supply of funny stories , but that amiable facade was just a trick to keep people from getting too close . John Walker realized long ago that if you make people laugh , they never realize that they do n't know you at all . The Walkers had a few good years of retirement , and then Luanne 's health began to fail . When the housekeeping became too much for one old fellow to handle , John had hired Becky Tilden from the trailer park down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had moved to the lake after an early and disastrous marriage , but originally she had been a Harkryder from Wake County , Tennessee , where John and Luanne had spent most of their lives . John helped her with the paperwork on her divorce , and he saw to it that Olan had n't made off with their Christmas club money or the wedding present silver plate . Becky had been with the Walkers ever since , more than ten years now . After Luanne died of a stroke , Becky looked in on John a couple of times a week , and he stayed on there in the lake house , fighting old age andthe infirmity which takes first one 's dignity , and then takes everything . Since Becky was as plain as pea turkey and had never finished high school , not even the most fanciful local gossips ever assumed there was anything going on between John Walker and his housekeeper , and there never was . John came from a generation that liked pretty women who knew their place ; a generation that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after them . Maybe if John had n't found Becky , he 'd have had to let some likely looking widow snare him , just for the housekeeping . After Luanne 's death , more than one local biddy had tried to get her hooks into him at the bridge club , but the aging Clairol blonde who always passed after his two no-trump opening bid had no chance of becoming the second Mrs. Walker . It was easier just to pay Becky minimum wage and not have to deal with courting and new kinfolks , grown stepchildren maybe , and all the rest of the social nonsense that John never could stand even when he had good health and more patience . Perhaps Becky 's greatest skill was the ability to put up with John Walker . Becky called the old man " Judge , " because he had once been a magistrate back in Tennessee , and , while she felt too close to him to call him " Mr. Walker , " it did n't seem right to her to call him " John " at his age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by extension to everyone else in his new community , the old man became known as " Judge . " He spent his seventies in a comfortable haze of fishing trips punctuated by bridge games , in an isolation that he thought of as independence , but this last Indian summer of health and middle age could not go on forever . At last , after a winter bout with bronchial pneumonia , the judge had lost the battle for self-sufficiency , and , despite his bitter objections , Becky Tilden had brought him back to Tennessee , where she would n't be so alone in caring for the old man . Hamelin was near to her kin and to the local hospital she trusted more than the " fancy country club one " near the lake in North Carolina . The lake folks were polite enough , but they treated her like the " help , " and the high-priced doctors at that hospital acted like she did n't have good sense , so she told John that it was time they went home . He was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to find new help , so back they went to Hamelin , just one mountain over the Tennessee line . Becky saw to the packing , and the closing of the last good times of Judge 's life . With the power of attorney he had given her in case of a medical emergency , Becky sold the lake cottage through an ad in the paper , because she 'd heardsomewherethat real estate agents charged a twenty percent commission . The judge did n't seem to care what she did as long as he was kept out of it . The cottage sold in a week , for far less than it was worth , but they were pleased with the transaction , because Becky did n't know any better and John was past caring . They used the money from the sale to buy a small frame house on five acres of hillside near town . The house was put in both their names , with the understanding that Becky would inherit it when Judge died . The old man was ending where he had begun , no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born in . They had settled in well enough , and Becky managed to fit in most of the lake house furniture , though some of the rooms were so cluttered they were hard to walk through . Judge did n't want to throw anything away , though . That old furniture was all of the past he had left , she supposed . He seemed to be happy enough in the new place until just recently , when he started having these conversations with people who just flat were n't there . He seemed fine , otherwise , but Becky was afraid that things were going to get worse , and she cast about for somebody who could tell her how much worse and how soon it was likely to happen . At first Becky had not even thought to call Nora Bonesteel , who was known in these parts for having the Sight . The Judge was past eighty , so the future was not exactly hard to predict . It was just a question of when , and that did n't matter very much . He could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned . He had lived a full life , and there did n't seem to be anything to look forward to on his part . As for Becky herself , she was fifty , and she reckoned that was old enough to be on her own when the time came . She still had family back in one of the hollers a few miles from town , but she did n't talk about her folks , and Judge had never known her to visit them . She reckoned Judge was family to her , after all these years , but the old man 's death did n't worry her much . The prospect of a prolonged and expensive illness was another matter , however . She was afraid they might lose the house if he needed too much intensive care . When Judge started acting peculiar and hearing voices , Becky had sent straight away for Dr. Banner , who had been everybody 's doctor when she was growing up in these parts . The doctor was nearly as old as Judge , and semiretired now , but he was alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he still made house calls for old friends . John Walker had treated the doctor 's visit as a social call , greeting him as calmly and pleasantly as he did the other callers that helped him pass the time these daysthe ones that Becky could n't see . When Alton Banner pulled out his stethoscope and said , " Well , John , it 's good to visit with you , but I came to work , " Judge had not protested , except to say that he felt as well as could be expected for a man over eighty . When Becky saw that Judge was going to cooperate with the examination , she left the two of them alone in the den to get on with it . Half an hour later , when she returned with mugs of coffee and a plate of Little Debbie brownies , carefully unwrapped and put on a Melmac plate , the medical part of the visit was over . The two old friends were sitting in companionable silence watching the Sports Channel on television . A while later , when John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Becky walked Alton Banner to the door . " What do you reckon ? " she asked . " Is it ... old-timers disease ? " Alzheimer 's , she meant . Alton Banner did n't correct her . Many of his less educated patients called it that , and he supposed it was as good a name as any . Whatever you called the ailment , it was a terrifying prospect . Poor Beckyshe 'd had to take a deep breath before she could even bring herself to say the words . He knew she was worried about her own future when John Walker passed on , and he supposed she hated the thought of Judge going that way , dying a little bit at a time , and taking all the good memories with him as he lost his own . The doctor shook his head . " I see no sign of senile dementia . John is lucid . We talked about everything from Tennessee football to his blood pressure medicationwhich , incidentally , seems to be working . We can be thankful for that . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his eighties . His hearing is n't what it once was . Neither is mine , come to that . But as for the quality of the conversation , John was holding his own as well as he ever did . I saw no deterioration . " " Did he tell you about his visitors ? " " None of them showed up while I was with him . John knew who I was . He was n't disoriented or delusional in conversation . He seems all right to me . " " I 'm glad you think so . " The tone of her voice made it clear that she was n't convinced . Alton Banner smiled . " Well , if you 're still worried , Becky , we can haul John into the medical center in Johnson City and do a thousand dollars ' worth of tests , but after they finish with him , I do n't think we 'll know a bit more than we do right now . Knowing John , I do n't think we could get him into that hospital for tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to order it , I will , and you can try to make him go . " " But ... he 's seeing things . " " Yes , he told me about the visitors . Just mentioned them in passing . It does n't seem to worry him , though . " " What should I do about it ? Can you give him something ? " Alton Banner shook his head . " John is n't the problem , Becky , " he said at last . " You are . You 're the one that 's worrying herself sick over the situation . John is fine . But I think you ought to call Nora Bonesteel . Ask her to come by and visit John . " " Nora Bonesteel ? But why ? " Alton Banner hesitated for a moment before he answered . " John might be lonely , " he said at last . " It would do him good to have some real live visitors every now and again . Nora Bonesteel has known him all her life , so they will have things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is patient with folks who are ailing . You send for her . Tell her I advised it . She 'll come . " All that was true enough . If there was more to it than that , Alton Banner saw no need to explain it to Becky Tilden . Now that Nora Bonesteel had come , Becky wondered what good her visit was going to do . Judge was having strange visions these days , but Nora Bonesteel had " seen " things all her life . What consolation could she be on the subject of hallucinations ? " I hate to see him like this , " said Becky , still watching John Walker from the doorway . " Judge was always such a tartar . If you did n't fix just exactly what he wanted for lunch , or if you forgot to pick up something when he sent you to town , he 'd tear a strip off you with his harsh words . Now Miss Luanne was n't put off at all by his domineering moods . She knew how to get around him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just laugh at him when he got into one of his conniptions , but he always scared me green , even though I knew he would n't do nothing but fuss . He 's never even threatened to fire me . Judge could say the most cruel things , though . You 'd do anything to make him stop . " She stared at the old man in the chair , searching for some trace of the bearlike tyrant he had once been . " Judge can be funny when he wants to be . People used to say he was more like Andy Griffith than Andy hisself , but he has a side to him , too . Sometimes I felt about eight years old when I was around Judge , and I used to wonder if that would have changed if I 'd had an education and an outside job to make money that did n't come from him . " " It 's hard to say . " " Well , he was my boss , and I let him have the last word , every time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's for sure . And , you know , I could never imagine him losing that power . I never could picture Judge old and weak ... wasting away . I always thought he 'd just keel over one day from sheer rage . You know , caught behind a farm truck on the no-passing stretch of Route 107 ? Oh , he hates slow drivers ! I thought one day Judge would boil over in fury and burst an artery , and it would all be over in two seconds . One minute he 'd be his fierce old self , and the next minute he 'd be goneinstantaneous darkness , like a power outage in a thunderstorm . That is the one thing about Judge I was sure of . " Nora Bonesteel nodded , but she was still looking out at the old man in the lawn chair . She had never seen the tyrannical side of John Walker , but then she did n't have to live with him . The dark side of mountain politeness is that an angry man sometimes swallows his rage against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the privacy of his home . She 'd known of more than one genial and witty man who was a terror in private . Whatever John Walker 's anger had been about , it was gone now . All that was left was the McCourry indifference , the hunkering down into the sufficiency of self that was the McCourrys ' strength and their refugeand ultimately the source of their loneliness . There was nothing she could do to change that , and even if she could it was likely that John would n't want her to try . " It would have been easier on everybody , would n't it ? " said Becky . " If Judge had just died in a heartbeat during one of his rages ? " Nora Bonesteel considered it . " Hardly any way is easy , " she said . " When people are taken sudden , their families grieve because there was n't time to resolve things , to make peace , and say good-bye . Oftentimes they are left with guilt . At least you 've been given time to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Becky did n't see any point in trying to make peace with a deaf old man who had probably forgotten most of the injuries he had inflictedcruel words and slights that still hurt her to the heart when she let herself dwell on them . What could he possibly say that would make up for the past , and how much sincerity would there be in any profession of forgiveness she made ? " Speaking of resolving things : You 've called his daughter , have n't you ? " Becky Tilden 's eyes widened , and she darted a glance at John Walker to see if he had heard them . " No ! " she whispered . " I ca n't ! He 'd never let me ! " Nora Bonesteel 's face hardened into the scowl reserved for irreverent boys in Sunday school class . " And why not ? " " He would n't let me . He never wants her to know when he 's took sick . He 'd say it 's on account of Lark being so famous and busy and all , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pains , but that 's not the real reason . They did n't get along , you know . Never did . He does n't want her to come . " " Never mind what he wants , Becky Tilden . And do n't try to tell me that an eighty-three-year-old man could stop you from making a phone call . Dying in peace is a fine thing , I 'm sure , but leaving your family in peace is just as important , and if that man goes without letting his only child come to say good-bye , it will be the cruelest thing he 's ever done to herand to my mind , that 's saying something . " Becky 's face took on the mulish expression that meant that she would try to get out of the chore without making an outright refusal . " Even if I call her , she may not want to come back . " " She ought to be given the chance , though . It 's her that has to go on living with memories , so I say it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that or shall I ? " Becky 's clouded face cleared with relief . " Oh , Miz Nora , would you tell him ? Ever ' time I try to talk about Lark , he just sets his face like a stone idol and turns away muttering . Would you like me to take you out to him now ? So you can tell him ? " Nora Bonesteel sighed . " I 've known John a long time , but we 're not close . This would be better coming from you , but if I have to do it I will . John Walker never scared me any . Not even waving a black snake over his head , and I 'm not about to start being afraid of him now . " " Well ... try not to upset him . " " It will be all right , Becky . I wo n't leave until he 's back in a good mood . You go in and call his daughter . Tell her she may not have long to dither about this . " Becky gasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? " Nora Bonesteel would not be drawn . " Never mind what I know , " she said . " You make that call right now . " The music soared on fiddle strings and thundered in drumbeats in her head . The tour bus had just reached a break in the trees on a Colorado mountainside , sending shafts of sunlight down on a patchwork of green rectangles hemstitched by white-trunked trees and lines of narrow creeks . Sometimes she liked to look out at the scenery , if only to measure their progress in the changing landscape , but today her mind was on other things and she was content to let the world slide by beneath her , unnoticed . Right now the sounds in her head were more compelling than the wonder of seeing the valley below from a telescopic distance . When you traveled enoughand lord knows she didthen beautiful scenery was nothing to get excited about anymore . Nothing worth seeing out the window . She spent a lot of the time sleeping in her little bedroom in the back of the bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were just downtime to be used productively , as long as the twists and turns did n't remind you that your " office " was hurtling along at sixty miles an hour . Lark McCourry clasped the earphones against her ears , listening not only to melody but to rhythm , and chord changes , and what she called the song path , by which she meant that she could hear where the song was going . Most people could tell generalities about a song in the music of their own culture . There was a pattern that songs followed . Each mode had its own rules , but after a while you learned to know what to expect in each one . Often a song played on the guitar would bring the tune back to the dominant chord to complete the verse where it began , and then the listener could hear that an ending had been reached . Lark 's song path went beyond that , though . When she closed her eyes , she could see the notes as colors . She could watch them swirl around each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make chords . She felt a gentle tapping on her arm , and in her mind the colors faded . She switched off the CD player . " Yes ? " " You 're missing some pretty scenery out there . " She managed a weak smile . Stevie Wolfe was a genius with catgut , and he could play anything anybody could hum , but he never could keep his mouth shut on road trips . She 'd never seen him pick up a book . Here in the Meadowlark , a customized Greyhound that had cost as much as her first house , Stevie paced the aisles so much that he might as well have walked to the performance . On planes he kept his seat belt on , with the aid of constant reminders from everybody else , but he never sat still . Airborne pacing became foot-tapping or the drumming of his fingers on the armrest . Lark thought he struck up conversations just to let his mouth move . He was on the wagon , though , and that was something . Better a sober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Guess these mountains are bigger than those molehills of yours back home . " She rolled her eyes . Jamie Raeburn , taking an outing from his corporate job with the record label , had finally decided to say something , and would n't you know it would be a condescending remark . Save us from the urban bureaucrats , Lark thought . Aloud she said , " Our mountains are older . The Appalachians probably looked like this when dinosaurs walked the earth , when these mountains really were molehills . " " Couple of trailers here and there , " Stevie Wolfe said innocently . " Look , Lark ! Do n't it might remind you of your Tennessee mountain home . " He was teasing . The Dolly Parton song title was part of the joke , but the corporate guy did n't get it . He thought Stevie was serious , for god 's sake . Lark sighed . " You guys are baiting me , hoping I 'll get on my soapbox about east Tennessee , because you 've got the fidgets . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , lay off . It wo n't work . " Raeburn smiled indulgently at her . Celebrities were like children , really . You had to take that into account . " Let 's hear your soapbox speech about east Tennessee . I 'm interested . Honest . " Remembering forbearance , Lark changed her scowl to a sigh . " Trailers my ass , " she said . " We were n't all poor back in east Tennessee , Jamie . My father was a lawyer . " Made a lawyer , the farm cousins used to say : John Walker made a lawyer , as if children were born as formless as clay and could be molded into their adult identities like model people in toy villages , discernible by their tools of office : the doctor with his stethoscope , the policeman with his badge . Lark looked down at the guitar that rested on a stand beside her stool . I made a musician , she thought . Made a musician . It was true enough that musicians are born , not made , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality of one 's voice was a gift . Those things could not be taught , and maybe in the old days they would have been enough to make a musician of their possessor , but by the time Lark McCourry came along , with a head full of old songs and a voice to sing them with , voice and memory were no longer enough . Now the music business was more business than music . Now it took movie star looks and a dancer 's body to keep you in the game . And sometimes even the voice was optional , now that studio magic and backup singers could smooth over any imperfections in an otherwise perfect package . Lark sometimes wondered if plump little Patsy Cline would have made it past the demo tape in the contemporary music world of size-four divas . The fat lady does n't sing anymore . Jamie pointed to the tape player in her lap , " So how do you like the song ? " Lark had not worked with Jamie Raeburn before . He had just been assigned to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come on the road trip to get a sense of her music and her audience . She hoped he knew what he was doing . You could never tell with corporate . She pressed the rewind key on the tape player . " It 's pretty good , Jamie . I 'm impressed . Not bad for your first effort . " " So how does it strike you ? " She considered it . " Well , when you listen to it for a while , the rhythm just becomes your heartbeat . It made me want to sway in time to the music , which is good . It 's Scottish , is n't it ? " Jamie Raeburn shrugged . " Close enough . From the Gaelic-speaking end of Britain anyhow . Did you recognize the tune , or was it just the shape of the melody that tipped you off about its origin ? " " Well , between that and the percussion it could hardly be anything else . Those drums in the background are bodhrans , are n't they ? " " Sound like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , though . It is n't new , is it ? Not with a sound like that it is n't . " He shook his head . " Traditional . I just thought you might know it . " " Do n't think so . I never heard it played back home . I thought the recording might be the Chieftains . Is the tune old enough to have come over with the pioneers ? " " I 'd have to look it up to be sure , but offhand I 'd say it 's as old as the Mountains of Mourne . That version you 're listening to is by one of my favorite musiciansMike Cross , who 's from North Carolina , not Ireland , which is why I thought you might know it . " She shook her head . " I like it , though . " " Good . It 's traditionalso no copyright problem . I thought that including it would add a grace note to the next album . " " Does it have words ? " " None that I ever heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a crack at writing the lyrics ourselves . " She nodded thoughtfully . " That might work . I have written songs for other albums . " " I know . You wrote Prayers the Devil Answers , ' did n't you ? " " Yeah . Title song on my first album . It came from a saying in our family . When you wish for something and it comes true in a bad way that you were n't expecting , we used to say that it was a prayer the devil answered . " Raeburn smiled . " Great line . " " I thought so . It got a lot of attention . Won some awards . I guess I owe my career to that song . " She looked around at the shabby old bus and smiled . " Maybe that was a prayer the devil answered . So ... what 's the name of this tune on the tape ? " He looked pleased with himself . " Well , see , that 's why I thought you 'd know . But I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . " She stared at him . " You 're serious ? " " I am . So if you like the melody , I think we have our title song , do n't you ? " " Sure . Perfect . But is it obscure enough ? I do n't want to compete with half a dozen other versions of it when the album comes out . " " I do n't think that will be a problem . I 'll check to make sure , of course . " " Good . Then all we need are a few more songs to record . Tunes that have n't been done to death . Remember when Dolly Parton and Kurt Cobain both did In the Pines ' on albums in the same month ? " Jamie Raeburn shrugged . " Go figure , " he said . He had been in high school when Kurt Cobain died , but it would n't be prudent to mention that to the talent here ; might make her feel old . Depression was bad for performance . " Now , as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that 's not really my thing . I thought that finding obscure folk melodies might be more in your line , given your Tennessee down-home roots . Surely there are old songs floating around those mountain hollers that have never been recorded . Something obscure that you heard as a child on somebody 's front porch ? " She wrinkled her nose . Hillbilly jokes were her least favorite part of the job . It was hard to tell if people were kidding or if they really were that stupid . Lark decided that her role , being the cultural ambassador for Appalachia , mostly meant informing city types that The Dukes of Hazzard was not a documentary . Sometimes , though , even the documentaries were n't what you 'd call true . In one recent case a socialite filmmaker made a " documentary " about the poor people of a small community in Appalachia and got on all the networks as the authority on the mountain South . Her film showed gaunt poor people living in shacks and trailers , and people everywhere tut-tutted about how sad it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What they did n't know was that in order to reach those few shanty houses , the film crew had to drive past two miles of well-kept , middle-class brick houses and an expensive new stone-and-glass community center . None of those positive images appeared in the film , of course . It would have spoiled the effect . Everything was image these days . Nobody cared what was real . " Songs in the holler . " She sighed . " You 're most of a century too late for quaint , Jamie . If you wanted to hear traditional songs , you should have asked my grandmother . When I was growing up , we were listening to Kris Kristofferson and Dolly Parton . Besides , the song catchers came in between the world wars , and they collected every song anybody would sing for them . " " Well , that 's good . Preserving the heritage . " Lark shook her head . " Nothing is ever that easy . I 'll tell you about it some time . It 'll be right up your alley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She closed her eyes , remembering a still summer evening on a dark front porch . A group of men in work boots sat in straight-backed kitchen chairs , handing a guitar back and forth . She pictured the glow of a lit cigarette wavering on somebody 's lips as he sang harmony in a quavering tenor voice . She pushed harder at the memory , trying to add sound to the images running in her head , but the audio portion of the scene would not be summoned . She could n't have been more than eight years old at the time , because not long after that , little girls are n't allowed to hang around anymore when the men folk get together . When they are little , all youngsters are puppies , free to tag along if they do n't make nuisances of themselves . Then children of either sex can be invisible listeners when the songs are sung and the tales are told by the menfolk in the family , but when little girls become big girls , the spell is broken .

There had been a song , though . She had heard it on one of those last magical summer evenings before she had been banished from the men 's world . What was that song ? An old sad melody . She could n't remember an instrument . Just sung , then , without accompaniment . Something about a woman and a ghost . She had only heard it once , but who had sung it ? One of her great-uncles ? The memory eluded her . " Could n't you take a couple of days and go home ? " Jamie was saying . " Maybe your family could come up with some old songs . " She sighed . " I do n't think so . My father is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot . But even when he was younger , he was fairly hopeless . In high school , when I first got interested in folk music , I tried to get him to sing me some old songs , because it was cool to come up with tunes that nobody else knew .

" She laughed at the memory . " Daddy 's next ancient folk ballad ' turned out to have been written in 1959 . And the one after that was Roy Acuff 's Wreck on the Highway , ' which anybody ought to know is not an eighteenth-century folk ballad . It turns out that my father can not tell authentic ballads from forties jukebox tunes . And even when he manages to get the words right , his melodies are pretty shaky .

" But that is n't the real reason I do n't want to go back . My father lives there . He and I do n't get along . " " Well , are n't there other people back there that might know the song ? " She considered it . " Maybe . Maybe I will go . There 's people back there I would n't mind seeing . It 's just that my dad is n't one of them .

First she checked the kitchen to see that it was tidied , and that the stove burners had not been left on . Then , with a last look , she put out the light . Next she came to her parlor , with its stone fireplace and the braided rag rug over the plank floora tidy room , smelling of lemon oil and beeswax . Then the overhead light in the hallway that led to her bedroom .
