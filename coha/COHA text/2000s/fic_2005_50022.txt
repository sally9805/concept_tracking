Olivia Alcuaz set down platters of spaghetti , tortillas , tomato and cucumber salad . She sat , lifted her chest as if she were in posture class , and launched into a tale about her cousin Enrique . Enrique had been driving down from Mexico when there were reports of a terrible crash involving a white car . Enrique 's car was white , so Olivia and her son , Fritz , drove out to the accident site . They battled their way to the front , through a mess of traffic and hysteria , shouting , We are relatives of people in the accident . When they arrived at the scene , there was Enrique , stuck on the other side of a barrier , peacefully eating an apple . " Aiee ! Enrique ! " said Olivia . <p> The next story was about a woman whose two children died within a year of each other ; the daughter in a car accident on a road in the mountains , the son murdered in the capital city . The silence at the table was reverential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Olivia addressed Ellen , her large , coy eyes limpid with emotion . Although Olivia 's Spanish was clear and measured , Ellen relied on her capacity to guess and surmise meaning from a tangle of language . Ellen listened without contributing to the conversation-ever since the day when she thought she 'd said she liked sausages , but instead had said that she liked tits . Silence was a virtue ; those who listened had power . At least they were n't likely to commit acts of self-humiliation . <p> I 've become a part of this family , Ellen imagined telling Charlie . The meals resemble episodes of an American talk show in which being a victim is an exalted condition , approaching sainthood . Tears for anointing the sacred , sorrow for entering heaven . Except , she was not , in fact , a member of Olivia 's family . And she could n't tell Charlie . <p> Jesus and the Apostles looked down from the wall . The dining room was long and narrow , with glass doors leading to a courtyard . Ellen imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarded by identical prints of the Last Supper , illustrating a final feeding of the body . Carmencita , Ia abuelita , obsessively arranged and rearranged the table setting , moving a bowl a half an inch , straightening a napkin , counting spoons . She smiled at Ellen , but avoided speaking to her . Thin and stooped , her temples were sunken , making her forehead bulge . Her soft frizz of gray hair formed a vaguely saint-like halo . <p> Fritz knocked over a pitcher of water as he sat , then apologized to Don Pablo for drenching him . Don Pablo peered up through the thick , distorting lenses of his eyeglasses and smiled , as if he 'd been baptized afresh . Ellen was fond of Don Pablo , who occupied the head of the table like a mushroom . His shrunken figure was barely visible , his chin exactly at the level of the table , so that he shoveled food in a straight line from plate to mouth . Deaf to conversation , he never looked up . Instead he mumbled to himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olivia said he was rich , a former chemistry professor and politician . She said his daughter , who lived in Washington , DC , refused to speak to him ; his granddaughter regularly flew him to Boston , but he always returned after a week because he missed his horse-just as decrepit and aged as he was . Olivia gave him bus fare to come in and out of town because he never seemed to have cash , and she reported on his status to his nephew in the capital , who sighed and said , " I am helpless . " Don Pablo refused to keep a muchacha to cook and clean for him in the fancy house on his finca , so he ate at Olivia 's . Olivia , una matriarca grande , welcomed strays at her table . Every day Don Pablo said he was bringing a squash from his garden for her , but he never did . <p> Fritz was tall with a heavy , hooked nose , hair hanging in his face , and bloodshot , puffy eyes . He winked at Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Last night , you leave too early . Crazy . " Ellen had gone out with Fritz and one of his friends the night before , except she 'd only stayed for one drink . Olivia tilted her head and sniffed , then she looked at Ellen in a soft , pained way , her mouth bent . As the only man in the house , Olivia 's son , Fritz , was adored . Even though he was twenty-six , everything was provided for him : food , clean clothes , spending money . Ellen poured herself coffee , feeling guilty , as if by going out for a drink with Fritz she 'd betrayed Olivia , who hated Fritz 's drinking . But , anyway , Ellen was a paying guest , a boarder ; loyalty should not be expected of her . <p> Olivia told more stories : about bus robberies , children bought and sold for their parts , four men murdered the previous week in a nearby town . Each detail , factual or otherwise , was noted with ecstatic lushness . Ellen did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like crying . She twirled spaghetti onto a fork and leaned over her plate to avoid splashing sauce on one of her two T-shirts . She felt a coolness inside , like opening a refrigerator . <p> Don Pablo wrapped tortillas and a pile of wet spaghetti into a napkin , then slipped them into his coat pocket , smiling beatificalIy into the air above the table . <p> Weekdays , after classes and lunch , Ellen studied on the third floor of the school . There was a roof and two walls to stop the worst of the afternoon winds . The two open sides looked over rooftops to steep hills and the volcano that rose above the town , austere and poised . It had last erupted forty years ago , according to a geologist studying Spanish at the school . Forty years in geological time , he said , was equivalent to less than thirty seconds . Ellen would turn forty in a few months . If she thought of her life , so far , as a thirty-second flash , it shrunk any sense of importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbs , and wrote short essays . She was a diligent student , but not a great speaker of Spanish . Ellen wanted to have a clear accent and to learn effortlessly , but in conversation she stopped to think and correct herself , and her American twang flattened Spanish vowels , her tongue stiff and unable to roll the r . It reassured her to recall that Charlie , who sang and danced with flair , who cooked divine meals , who could tear apart a car engine , then put it back together , had been terrible at learning foreign languages . Ellen needed to speak Spanish to the employees of her landscaping company , so this was her life for three months : language instruction five hours a day , and residence in Olivia 's house . <p> Alone on the third floor , she watched the thin veils of steam unfurling from vents in the mountain . Her notebook was open , her homemade flashcards stacked before her while her mind lay down like a dog in the street , indifferent to the fact that anybody might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow , it would be a year since Charlie had disappeared while on a climbing trip in Pakistan . He was n't her husband-he was somebody else 's husband . Someone he 'd left but had n't yet divorced . Her sister had said , " Make him tell her he 's involved with someone else . It 's unfair to her and to you . It 's dishonest . " But if Ellen told him what to do , how would she know his feelings were genuine ? When he disappeared she felt abruptly rendered invisible . Well , perhaps that was a bit dramatic . Still , what kind of karma was it , to meet someone you really liked , only to have him disappear and then have to pretend as if you had n't ever massaged his shoulders , bit his earlobe , smelled his warm neck ? <p> " Hola , Elena , que tal ? " Fernando snuck up on her beneath the noise of palms flailing the wind , pulled a chair close , took out his guitar , and fixed Ellen with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He appeared every afternoon , even , she imagined , when she was n't there . <p> He strummed a few chords , tuned the guitar , and launched into a song . Before becoming a Spanish instructor to foreigners , he 'd been a professional musician , so these impromptu performances were no sloppy sing-alongs . His voice was deep and thrilling , lifting and meeting the wind . The only word she understood was amore , love . His eyes , tidy black seeds , settled on her . His expression was solemn , as if he were working . <p> Where was she supposed to look during these serenades ? She shifted her gaze from the volcano to his face , to his hands on the guitar , to her notebook , and then around again . <p> He stopped playing . " Comprendes ? " <p> She shook her head . She had n't even been trying to understand , wondering instead if she appeared to him as the clod she felt herself to be-a giant American woman , stumbling through a graceful language , crashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was politely called lanky . She was tall and thin , with kneecaps that looked like buried baseballs . But her eyes , gray as cloudy weather , were soft and expressive , and her pale skin , she 'd been told , was exquisite to touch . She wore her thick , straight hair cut short so that in her own mind , she was a pin-thin and straight with a little hard head at the top . <p> He explained , in rapid , liquid Spanish , that the song was about two lovers ( what a surprise ! ) who could not be together-was it illness , or her parents would n't allow it , or what ? Anyway , some reason . A sad song , Fernando admitted . All love songs are sad , she said . Was that true ? Silence . They stared at each other . <p> There was nothing hidden or subtle about Fernando and his intentions . You never wondered , Is he attracted to me ? Carnivorous , Ellen thought . Lust was carnivorous . She could n't insinuate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For one thing , he was an instructor at the school-not her instructor , but still . And his hands were smaller than hers ; she stared at them picking at the guitar strings . His feet were like a boy 's , his waist like a girl 's . He was perfectly proportioned with graceful features and deep eyes : a small thing of beauty . <p> " Demasiado trgico , " Fernando said . " Como , ahhh . " His breath exhaled in a fluttering sigh . <p> What would she possibly do with him ? She smiled . <p> " Why are you smiling ? " <p> " I was thinking of my sister . " Of how they loved to add the phrase " in bed " onto Chinese fortune cookies . You are lucky to have many friends ; in bed . When winter comes , heaven will rain fortune on you ; in bed . Be on the alert for new opportunity ; in bed . But she did n't tell Fernando this . <p> " Is your sister like you ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible , married with children . " Silence , made loud by the wind threshing the palms against the sky . Her mind was blank , separated from her body , one knee touching his . <p> " Why are n't you married , " he said . <p> " I 've told you already , I like solitude . " She was in never-never land ; never married , never had children . Maybe she would have married Charlie , maybe she would have been happy with him . She would never know . Never know , never yes , never no . " Why do you keep asking ? " The hormonal bubble burst , she was herself again . " You 've already got your foreign girlfriend . Besides , I 'm ten years older than you . " Two of the many reasons why she should n't grant this flirtation her attention . <p> He looked away . " You are so frank . " Then he laughed . " I like foreign women . And I like older women . " Softly , he rubbed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give . " <p> A baldly selfish sentiment . She fidgeted in her chair , taking her knee out of his reach . Give what ? Not for her this abundance of giving ; she felt crpey and dry inside . <p> " A m no me gusta la soledad . " He did n't like to be alone . <p> Another way in which we 're different , she said . Generally Ellen had flings , not relationships . She and Charlie had been together for nine months , a long haul . Of her nearly forty years , Ellen had spent perhaps three with steady boyfriends . Not an impressive record . <p> " Como , ahhh , " Fernando sighed . " Demasiado trgico . " <p> Bastante , sufkiente , demasiado : enough , sufficient , excessive . <p> The director of the school appeared at the top of the stairs . She told Ellen there was a fax for her , but she looked at Fernando . A look full of remonstrance . Fernando pushed out his chest and said , " Meet me at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but watched the director . What was going on ? A question she asked herself a hundred times a day . <p> They had n't yet met outside the school . Inside her head she chanted no , no , no , while she nodded in agreement . Why not , after all . He was leaving soon , and so was she . She stubbed her broken pencil like a cigarette into her notebook . <p> The fax was from Cruz , her foreman . It was in Spanish and English and full of misspellings . He reported that they 'd finished servicing all the machines ; what next ? When was she coming home ? In nine days ; she counted them on the calendar in her notebook . <p> At the house on Calle Querido , Olivia was frying pltanos in the kitchen , standing back from the pan to prevent grease from spattering her silky blouse . She was in her sixties , and she was careful about her appearance : a touch of mascara and liner , makeup to smooth her complexion , lipstick before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie would have loved pltanos fixed this way , how he would have been amused by Olivia 's fondness for familial dramas . <p> Olivia was upset because Fritz refused to speak with Claudia , his brother 's wife , not even buenas tardes , he hated her so much , and now Claudia 's father had had a stroke . At least , this was what Ellen guessed from the torrent of language . So many relatives and friends came through Olivia 's house and were featured in her conversation that Ellen could n't keep relationships straight . Olivia was tenacious in her preoccupation with the troubles of others . But what of her own disasters ? Olivia 's husband was absent . He was either in Germany or in the capital or in some other Central American country . He had either been kicked out by Olivia , or he had abandoned her . Ellen never knew if something was genuinely obscure , or if the obscurity was due to her bad Spanish . She wondered what tore Olivia 's heart into pieces , what made opening her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her soul lie awake at night , chewing itself into bits ? <p> Putting beans into a bowl , Olivia launched into an account of the collapse of some bleachers at a soccer game in the capital in which twenty people had died . She had heard from a friend that someone she knew-a friend of a distant cousin , or something like that-had lost five sons in the tragedy . Ellen felt like Olivia 's confessor . She listened carefully , sympathetically ; she gave herself headaches trying to make connections and understand . <p> Dinner-black beans , pltanos , white cheese , and tortillas-was a somber affair , with only women present . Fritz was out , as usual , and Don Pablo was presumably in his expansive , empty house eating leftover spaghetti , or perhaps he fed that to his chickens and ate nothing . Marisol , daughter of a friend , arrived . She was in her twenties with thick , soft lips reddened with lipstick , sultry eyes , and a pillowy chest . She lifted her fork the way she would remove her blouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellen imagined her lying down on a bed , opening her legs , taking a bath in some man 's desire . With Marisol at dinner , the room became warm and languid . <p> Olivia tried once again to theorize why four men had been killed by a mob in a small town in the mountains several weeks earlier , as if that might give her some purchase on the soccer stadium deaths , which seemed to be too fresh and tender for direct analysis and discussion . Then she turned to the topic of Pedro , a young man in the neighborhood who had cerebral palsy . The doctors had told his mother , Sophia , that he 'd contracted the disease because she had refused to have a C-section and the baby became infected with fluid . Sophia had had a difficult life . Oh , such a lovely woman , muy amable , gentile , linda . Sophia 's aunt had been an intellectual , a professor of political science married to a decorated WWII soldier from France . The aunt was thought to be a communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers gunned her down outside the Institute of Women where she worked . Except she did n't die . On her third day in the hospital , her niece Sophia there to spend the night with her , the soldiers entered and shot the aunt dead . Olivia 's face was shining with sorrow and grace , and Ellen felt a rush of admiration and affection for her , for her capacity to excavate suffering so thoroughly and regularly , two meals a day . Carmencita smiled , deaf to the tragic . And Marisol was damp with sympathy . There was a long moment of respectful silence before Olivia sighed and said , Oh , the soccer stadium deaths . <p> Fernando and Ellen sat in a red naugahyde booth in the Shanghai , the town 's Chinese restaurant , a blond plastic table between them . Fernando ordered fries , and they split a beer . He and Ellen traded Spanish and English . It was this talk that thrilled her , the way her lips moved , the way her tongue lifted and fluttered , and the obscurity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel of unfamiliar words in her mouth was like a stranger 's tongue . She sounded simple-minded in Spanish , each sentence constructed from basic words , in the wrong order or form . When she switched to English it was a blessing of fluency , and she fired off sentences , giddy with the effortlessness of it , pleased by her cleverness , her wit , her virtuosity . In English , Fernando was vulnerable and exposed , mispronouncing words and delivering sentences without verbs . They traded their incompetence back and forth , as if they were undressing , then dressing up , then stripping again . The waitresses turned off all the lights in the restaurant except for the one over their table . Fernando asked for five more minutes , and one of the women shook her head , no . An ugly pale dog with pink eyes began to run around the restaurant , barking , toenails clicking on the linoleum . Fernando was going to the capital in a day or two and then flying to Switzerland to meet his girlfriend . <p> He insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty . Their shoulders touched as they tried to fit side-by-side on the narrow sidewalk . <p> " You have a boyfriend , right ? " Fernando asked , drawing his shoulder free of hers . <p> " If I had a boyfriend , I would n't be flirting with you . " My boyfriend is dead . Maybe . <p> " Como , ahhh . You are so frank . " He looked exasperated . " But that is unusual . Women are not loyal . Do you think I 'm faithful ? " <p> " No . " <p> " It 's difficult , eh ? Sometimes you just meet someone you really like . " He stopped and took her hand , laced his fingers through hers . The international signal of impending intimacy . She rolled her eyes . They were on a dark street corner , near the Blue Angel caf , which was closed . Dogs barked . <p> " I want to have some memory of you , " he said . <p> " Yeah , well . " Ellen felt brisk , resistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had a sudden resentment against romance ; so much trouble , so little payoff . Or , the results could be huge , painfully so . <p> He pushed up against her and licked her throat with the strong point of his tongue . He maneuvered her into a corner , and she felt the cobbled stones of the street beneath her feet . A dog barked from behind a wall , and a large speckled one ran past . " No olvidas los perros , " he said , against her mouth . <p> " No . Not like a couple of adolescents . " She grabbed his hand , held it still . <p> " S. Necesitamos una cama . " What about your room ? he wanted to know . <p> Absolutely not . Ellen 's room abutted onto Olivia's-the door between telegraphing phone conversations and television shows . <p> " Nothing is going to happen , " she said . They kept kissing . She forgot how small he was , and she had a sudden , inappropriate desire to laugh . How inglorious : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dog shit . Romance . <p> They went through the discussion about her room once again ; he showed her a condom he had in his pocket , full of hope . He pinched her left nipple . " It 's going to end like this . Como , ahhh , nada , al final . " <p> They stood in silence , his fingers strumming her ribs . <p> Outside the house on Calle Querido , he kissed her mouth and both cheeks . She thought for a moment that he might be the love of her life about to disappear forever . Everyone was dipped in a yearning for romance . He turned to look at her three times before blending into the darkness . She stood outside the door until he was gone from sight , not because she loved him , but because it took her that long to feel the black moonless night pressing against her , like a cool hand stroking her forehead . <p> When Ellen closed the front door , it was midnight , and the house was in an uproar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to be late . Olivia was certain that he and his friend , who had a car , were drunk and would get in an accident . Once , in church , she 'd been praying to a shrine , which spoke and informed her that Fritz was in danger . Three days later , Fritz broke his arm and nose and something else Ellen did n't understand ; he was in the hospital for weeks . <p> Olivia called a taxi . Before the hallway mirror , she applied fresh lipstick and tied a turquoise scarf around her neck . Fetch the boy home . The plan was to tell Fritz that Carmencita , his abuelita , was ill . At first , Olivia wanted Ellen to stay home and take charge of Carmencita , but what was Ellen to do with an eighty-year-old who could hardly hear , much less understand Ellen 's flawed Spanish ? Ellen did n't approve of the panicked launching of this expedition . Fritz was an adult , let him encounter his own fate . She did n't approve of lying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young and risk-hungry . But it was clear that Olivia considered Ellen 's participation important . Olivia , Ellen , and Marisol , who was staying over , loaded into the taxi and drove into the night . <p> The walls and floor of the disco vibrated with the pulse of salsa , making Ellen , posted by the exit , move her hips . Charlie had loved to dance . She stripped down to her T-shirt . Couples matched forward and backward movements , and Ellen felt the stroking , grinding rhythm . Olivia , like an evangelist knocking at the doors of strangers , prowled the dance floor . Marisol sank into the scene , and Ellen watched as a man wrapped an arm around her waist and pulled her tight against him . Marisol seemed to forget the task at hand , submitting dreamily to a session of dry-humping , leaning her head against the stranger 's shoulder while he squeezed her ass . Desire was so uncomplicated for some people . Ellen sighed . They were n't going to find Fritz . It did n't matter if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful Spanish , if love was not the answer to anything . She stood against the wall , and nobody touched her , nobody even brushed against her by accident . She allowed herself the dark , secret pleasure of anonymity . She was nowhere ; she was no one . <p> They gave up and returned home to find Carmencita sitting in the bed she shared with Olivia , late-night TV blaring , all the lights on , looking more fit and cheerful than usual . Olivia bugged her eyes out at her mother , snapped the bedroom light off , and hissed that she was supposed to be sick . <p> In her dream Ellen was trying to remember the future form of salir-to leave . I will leave . He is going to leave . The sounds of traffic and the smell of exhaust creeping from the street into her room woke her up . Her nose , the only exposed part of herself , was cold . She looked at the painting of Jesus on the wall of her room . Each thorn of his crown created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dot of red paint . Catholicism used such brutal imagery , you 'd think it would be adequate preparation for life on earth . Yet everyone was unprepared . On the opposite wall hung a doll by its neck . It looked desolate and suicidal . She dressed quickly and snuck out of the house before breakfast . <p> On her way to the bus stop , she stepped around drunks passed out on the narrow sidewalks . This morning there was one on the street that smelled of piss with a trickle of blood from where his forehead had hit the concrete . She stared at the line of red against the pale gray of the sidewalk . <p> She took a bus and then hiked up La Muela , a petite , inactive volcano at the edge of town . Everyone had told her it was dangerous to hike alone , but she had to be outdoors . The country was open , fields of wheat and onions , rolling foothills , views across the valley . The trail passed through cedars , oak , a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumbled black lava rocks . She glanced around and scanned the trees , wary . Each of Olivia 's stories ran through her head . <p> As she climbed higher , it appeared as if the clouds were drifting below her , as if she had risen above them . Or perhaps the clouds were closer to earth in this country . It did n't take long to arrive at the crater , which had a couple of renegade pines growing from the middle of it . She could hear , in the distance , the thud of blade against wood-someone was cutting down a tree . Clouds drifted past . Her mind was empty for a few minutes , and she simply listened to her breath moving in and out of her lungs . Why had Charlie disappeared ? Like a cramp , she felt the intensity of her desire that he not be gone . She bent over . Please , please . An ant labored across the sharp lava . It slid down a sheer bit , then turned and went off to the side , black as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been trekking to the base camp of K2 with two friends , who saw him one minute , looked back for him another minute , and he was gone . Was it an accident , suicide , murder ? Was he dead or was he living a new life elsewhere-in Auckland , maybe , or Madagascar ? A search and investigation were conducted . Charlie 's wife flew to Pakistan , and Ellen fretted at home in Santa Fe . Charlie 's friends told her what was happening and kept her existence a secret from Charlie 's wife . It was November , and the landscaping season was at an ebb . She planted tulip and daffodil bulbs , her fingers kneading the cold earth . Nothing was discovered , no body , no bit of clothing , no knapsack or water bottle , no witnesses . How do you grieve for someone who is n't definitely dead , is n't definitely yours to mourn ? What had she lost ? <p> Although Ellen did n't believe in the **31;1898;TOOLONG approach to life prevalent in Santa Fe , she went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and Charlie had been brother and sister in their previous lives and the spirits felt it was n't right for them to be intimate in this lifetime . Maybe he 'd stepped off a cliff to avoid a relationship with his former sister . It sounded like complete nonsense , but Ellen felt terrible , nonetheless , which lent a new focus to her misery . This was what the New Age could do for you : implicate you in your own troubles . <p> She took out a photo of Charlie , in baseball cap and sunglasses , standing at the open door of her work truck . She knew the way his eyes looked behind the sunglasses , warm , affectionate . She had a sudden memory of him pinning her to a bed with his weight , how her rib cage would sag in an accommodating way , how her thinness could tolerate the heft of him . She folded the photo into a clumsy airplane and launched it into the crater . It lifted for half a second in the wind , then plunged into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane and Charlie were on it , he 'd be dead . <p> She descended the path quickly , stumbling over rocks , as if her luck were on a timer and it might run out . White vapor emerged from two holes at the base . Maybe the volcano was only pretending to be inactive . Then there was a man . Legs spread , he held a machete point down against his left thigh , standing in the middle of the path . She stopped , her heart pounding into her shoulders . He walked towards her , and she looked for signs of evil intent , but all she noticed was how short he was , much shorter than she , and then how beautiful , with a compact , strong body and face like a Mayan god . Was he a bad person ? <p> He lifted her right hand with the point of his machete and waved his left at her . He wanted her ? He wanted her things ? She took off her watch , not a very good watch , fumbling with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked her over , but she did n't wear jewelry , not even earrings . She unslung her knapsack and opened it , showing him her notebook , reading glasses , water bottle , wallet . She gave him all the cash in the wallet , maybe five dollars ' worth of currency . She did n't carry her passport , only a copy of it . He folded the bills into his pants pocket , staring into her knapsack sternly . Addressing the practical aspects of handing over her possessions soothed her , but she was aware of their measly nature . He was n't getting much of a haul . He lifted the edge of her skirt above her knees with the machete , and she felt embarrassed for her bony kneecaps . She was wearing a long skirt and a long-sleeved T-shirt , her sweater wrapped around her waist . He raised the machete . She held her breath and saw , as if from a distance , her head cleaved from her body . Furious , relieved , stomach roiling , body frozen and immobile , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died now , who would know how ? Who would know why ? But he only brought the flat side gently down onto her head , pressing her so that she bent over , as if to permit her to throw up . Then he flipped the machete and tapped her under the chin , lifting her slightly . She felt the touch of metal , glimpsed its dull sheen , the sharpness of its edge . She was bent horizontal , and he stepped closer so she had a view of his wide , bare feet ; they looked like farm implements . What was he doing ? Could she run from a man with a machete ? She was in a position of supplication , her hands resting lightly on her knees . She might be bowing or praying . The inside of her head felt enormous , a vacant plain filled with undulant light . How still she felt , as if becalmed . Stalled in a world gone windless . The dirt was soft here ; it was a Saturday . He was not a bad person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , this man looming above her , out of her line of sight . <p> He stepped back , lifted her a bit more with the machete beneath her chin , then pulled the top of her T-shirt out with the point . Oh , he was trying to see her breasts , but they were small and unimpressive , hidden in a close-fitting , elastic bra . She felt herself flush with a sudden impulse to swat at him . Who was he to take this ... this look ? After all , a mere look . Then , he moved away , quick and silent , his feet-feet of a thief , a potential rapist , a silent man whose language she did not share-disappearing from view . <p> She walked back to town because she had no money for the bus . Adrenaline ran through her like fresh water . How strange that a small man with a fierce beak of a nose had made her bow , had taken five dollars from her , and looked down her shirt . It was as if he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the oddity of aborted danger ; it left you feeling blessed . And merely because you 'd looked down the throat of pain and suffering and death , you felt deserving of the bit of life left to you . On her right , the hillside was planted with ragged cornstalks in steep patches . Why did n't they terrace their fields ? Everything felt mysterious , strangely wonderful and wonderfully strange . The air smelled dry and sharp , like geraniums , with the slightly burnt scent of coffee . <p> Olivia brought coffee , pineapple , and a scrambled egg into the dining room . No sign of Fritz , she said and wiped at the dark circles beneath her eyes . Ellen could n't look at her fallen face . She bent to her plate and concentrated on the radio 's stream of prayer . The Virgin del Rosario 's mysteries were being detailed each morning . What good did this do anyone ? Its chanting repetition made her feel sarcastic . Olivia turned her large , suffering eyes to Ellen . Would she come to mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last Supper , then leaned over to retie her shoes . If this were her real family , she would say no without hesitation . You could deny anything to the people you loved , but you were obligated to strangers . <p> Leaving the dishes in the stone sink , Olivia put on pink lipstick and arranged a rose-patterned scarf over her shoulders , and she and Ellen went to mass . <p> Inside the church , in the empty space behind the pews , hundreds of people knelt on the cold , stone floor . Olivia chose a pew , greeting a few people . She whispered to Ellen that it was the month of the Festival of the Virgin del Rosario . Her breath feathered at Ellen 's ear , evoking a memory from childhood of whispering in church with her sister for the sake of the sensual tickle of breath against the tender skin of an ear . She thought about Charlie , then Fernando , then the man with the machete . The priest droned , and the people responded , as if from one throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terribly , her knees hurt , her hands and her neck were cold . The smell of candle wax and incense plagued the headache she always seemed to have . <p> She looked around . She was surrounded by several hundred unsmiling people on their knees in a building made entirely of gray stone , praying in unison . Hoping for simplicity , craving relief from their mistakes . The sound filled the frigid air around her , pressing against her chest : the noises whales made , the rumbling of a volcano , song of prayer . Olivia 's head was bowed in prayer , or defeat . Fritz would be fine , or not . It was out of Olivia 's hands . Ellen remembered the feel of Fernando 's delicate body against her own . She looked up at the Virgin , who gazed down the length of the transept with an expression of such depression and desolation you wanted to offer her a vodka tonic , some Prozac , a piece of fruit , anything . She held a chubby , golden-shoed baby with an adult face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His head was dropped back as if in ecstasy , or maybe his neck was broken . An old woman in front of Ellen began to cough in convulsive spasms , as if she were trying to throw a knot of air from inside her . Ellen stared at the sorrowful Virgin absently cradling her malformed child . And all the stories of death and disaster filled her head , trickled down into her heart . Her heart was filling and filling with water . Her throat turned into a rock , her eyes burned . She concentrated on the dry , twisting cough of the old woman . She thought of the battles in The Iliad , the gruesomeness of human affliction and destruction . Remembering how eyes were stabbed and guts pushed out , the graphic quality of the mayhem calmed her a little . Human beings were destined for messy endings . Still , she might weep in the midst of this orderly mass . <p> Ellen fled . She stumbled over knees in the aisle , half-ran toward the doors , then walked the streets without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the perfume of diesel . And there was Don Pablo on a corner , hands in his pockets , smiling at nothing . She shouted buenas at him , and he gazed at her as if he might know her , or perhaps he imagined she was someone else entirely , someone he 'd once known . Seeing him in public , it was obvious how derelict he was : a man who had n't showered in weeks , never combed his hair , or rinsed his glasses , or changed his pants . A parked bus beside him had an ornately decorative sign on its forehead : La Sombra del Amor Sufre al Verme . The shadow , she translated . Of love . . . Then she hesitated , looking over her shoulder as if for someone to confirm her translation , or correct her . There was no one . She read the sign again , wondering what it was doing there , on a bus , in Spanish , in a Central American town , this message : The shadow of love suffers to see me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
