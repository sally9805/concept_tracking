At least along the runways , the stars were in alignment last week . The usual stable of celebrities and editors lined the front rows at the couture shows in Paris . Sofia Coppola ogled John Galliano 's Empire-waist Josephine dresses at Dior . At Armani 's haute-couture debut , Penlope Cruz perused her options for the red carpets at this year 's awards ceremonies . Even Vogue editor Anna Wintour was back in town after sitting out the past two spring couture seasons . But those who wanted to see the real action needed to keep an eye on the new faces in the crowd . <P> Among the ones to watch were those of three brothers from Florida who were attending their first haute-couture parade . Just one day after buying the house of Christian Lacroix from the French luxury group LVMH for an undisclosed sum , Simon , Jerome and Leon Falic took their seats at their new employee 's show . It was among the most anticipated events on the week 's calendar , not just because of Lacroix 's reputation as one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the LVMH-Falic deal had been circulating since early January . The Falics , who own a chain of airport duty-free shops , have no previous experience running a fashion house . The looming question : Would they allow Lacroix to continue his haute-couture line which , like most others , is a perennial money loser ? Or was their aim to milk Lacroix 's name to cash in on his ready-to-wear clothes and accessories or introduce assorted baubles ? <P> That three newcomers suddenly hold such sway over the future of haute couture  --  the handcrafted , custom-made clothes that purists consider fashion 's highest art form  --  was just one of many reminders last week of the fashion industry 's turmoil . And the dislocations are by no means confined to the rarefied levels of couture . Tremors are shaking up ready-to-wear too . In the late 1990s luxury groups like Gucci and Prada began snapping up stakes in labels by ultracool but often young and untested designers . Now the money men are losing patience and no longer want to wait for a hefty return on their investments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom-line pressures from their conglomerate owners or are frustrated by what they see as insufficient financial support from them . <P> So last week , Helmut Lang , the Austrian-born ready-to-wear designer and reigning minimalist of the ' 90s , resigned from his own company , which is owned by the Prada Group . The move ended a feud with Prada CEO Patrizio Bertelli over how to reverse losses at Lang 's line . In the mid- ' 90s , Lang 's sales were as high as $100 million . When he sold a 51% stake in his namesake brand in 1999 , Lang touted Bertelli as a guy who " understands the culture of a high-end product , " and said , " His line is very , very well managed . " Bertelli , who later purchased the remaining 49% of the brand , was just as excited about the combination . His big plans for the Lang line included Prada-produced accessories , a beefed up advertising budget and at least a dozen freestanding stores in the U.S. , Europe and Asia . Instead , Bertelli is left with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2003 and the task of making the Lang brand profitable without Lang .
