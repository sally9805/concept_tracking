<p> Ramiro Reyes can feel his horse fidgeting underneath the saddle . Like Mr. Reyes , the horse is eager for action . A hand-painted sign nearby warns , " No responsables por accidentes . " Suddenly a gate clangs open onto the dusty arena , and a muscular bull charges out . The chase is on . Reyes pulls his steed at full gallop alongside the bull , and reaches for the bull 's tail . With one deft move , he wraps the tail around his leg and spurs the horse to a faster gallop . The bull tumbles end over end into a cloud of dust . The crowd cheers . " Excellent job , now that 's a good horseman , " exults Emilio Salas , a judge at this tournament of charreria , speaking into a microphone , as Mexican accordion music blares over the loudspeakers of this small arena in the scrubby ranchlands 15 miles southwest of San Antonio . The bull , shaking stars out of its head , snorts indignantly and trots out of the arena . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it has a purpose . Tumbling and stunning a bull in this way once allowed vaqueros to rush up and brand a bull on the open range . Today , this skill is just one of a dozen events in a sport called charreria , which is performed in out-of-the-way corners nearly every weekend across the Southwest from late March to early October . For Latinos like Ramiro Reyes , it 's a chance to rediscover their ranching roots and their cultural pride in a sport that began nearly 100 years before the arrival of the first Anglos in Texas in the 1820s . While most Texans have never heard of it , charreria is the root of much of what people now call Texas culture , and certainly of rodeo itself . Rodeo , of course , has evolved into a sport of multimillion-dollar cash prizes and sponsorships from multinational corporations . Charreria , by contrast , is a more homegrown affair . Competitors , including laborers , business professionals , and recently arrived Mexican immigrants , consider this a weekend hobby , like a game of golf with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be small , around $ 700 for the first-place team , $ 500 for second place , and so on , but by staying small , charreria has been able to retain much of its historic flavor . Even today , charreadas allow ranchers and urbanites to show off their livestock and compete for bragging rights on who 's the best horseman . The roots of Western rodeo " In Texas history books , they either look at the Mexican charro or the Anglo cowboy ; the thing they leave out is the Tejano , " says Andres Tijerina , a historian at Austin Community College and author of " Tejano Empire , " a book on the history of Hispanic ranching culture . " But the Tejano , the vaquero , is the person who perfected all these skills , and the one who introduced them to the Anglo Americans . " The fact is , the environment Anglo cowboys operated in was wholly created by Mexican vaqueros . On arriving in Texas , most Anglos gave up the whips and English saddles they had used back East , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lariat " ) and Mexican-style saddle , complete with a saddle horn and protective leather " taps " on their stirrups , to ward off thorns and cactus . Until the early 1900s , in fact , most Anglos still preferred to be called vaquero rather than the slightly demeaning " cowboy . " Tejanos even created the first singing cowboy , although their singing was nothing like Tex Ritter in those old Westerns . According to one entranced Anglo observer , Tejanos learned to lure wild cattle out of the thorniest chaparral by sending in some of their tame cattle to mingle with the wild ones . Then the Tejanos would call their cattle for feeding time , calling out " oooooo-mah , " and the wild ones would follow the tame into the open , only to be captured by a waiting vaquero . It was n't " Happy Trails , " but it worked . Feats of horsemanship At today 's tournaments of charreria , charros still exhibit the same grit and skill that show how the West was really won . They perform the cala de caballo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full turns , all with subtle signals from the legs . Women perform the the escaramusa , or " skirmish , " while riding side-saddle at full gallop . And men practice manganas a pie , or rope tricks on foot , which include twirling a lariat from left to right , and jumping in and out of the loop , before snagging the leg of a charging bull . It 's occasionally dangerous , but all very practical for ranch life . Modern charros have even found ways to address some concerns of animal-rights activists . They use hemp rope , for instance , when roping horses or bulls , which has a tendency to break if it comes under sudden stress . This saves the roped animal from injuring itself . American charros also get points deducted if they trip a horse during roping events . Instead , they ease the rope to slow the horse . Oddly enough , the sport of charreria is encountering a revival precisely at a time when fewer Tejanos actually make a living from ranching . With more and more Mexican-Americans integrating into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere tradition - or adrenaline . " I ca n't help but see it as a form of resistance , " says Dr. Tijerina . " Mexican-Americans are very sensitive to the fact that Anglo- Americans see them as unwanted immigrants . Here 's a way of setting the record straight . Tejanos were here first . Legitimacy : That 's the one thing Mexican-Americans need to feel . " The crowds at charreadas , as the tournaments are called , tend to be overwhelmingly Latino . These are family affairs , after all . But while these events are not often well publicized , and can be devilishly hard to find , they occur nearly every weekend from late March to early October , in a rotation of Southwest cities . Groups are loosely organized into charro associations in the various regions . The San Antonio association is the oldest in Texas , started in 1947 . But there are also less-formal charreadas held by ranches near towns farther south in Texas , such as Zapata or Hebronville . No club exists in those towns , but charreadas are informal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observers say these informal groups have maintained more of the native Tejano flavor , while the clubs use actual rule books and dress codes borrowed from Mexico . Anglos are welcome at charreadas , organizers will tell you , although a knowledge of Spanish is useful in understanding the announcements . Like many competitors in Lytle , Roberto Chavira of Austin wears the uniform of the charro : wide-brimmed sombrero , with tight pants and a short jacket embroidered with needlework . A former bull rider in Western-style rodeo , Mr. Chavira says he fell in love with charreria the first time he saw a parade of Mexican charros . " The moment I saw that , something hit me . I said , ' Wow , that 's powerful , ' " says Chavira , an Austin police officer who grew up in a family of migrant farm workers in west Texas . Looking out at the audience , and toward the kids practicing rope tricks , he adds , " This is family , this is religion , culture , tradition . It 's a way of life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop in San Antonio , grew up riding horses in San Luis Potosi , Mexico , but he got involved with charreria only when he came north to settle in the US . " This is my only sport ; I do n't have the height for football , " he says , standing outside the arena , watching his fellow charros perform the coleada , or bull-tail-grabbing event . Asked about his favorite event , he smiles . " I ride the bulls . In American rodeo , they just have to keep riding for 8 seconds . In Mexican charreria , we 've got to stay on top of the bull until he stops kicking , no matter what it takes . " Is n't that dangerous ? a visitor asks . " I was five years old when I first started riding horses , " he replies , without sounding arrogant . " To me , it 's nothing . " Next generation of charros In the parking lot , the next generation is working on rope tricks . The youngest in the group are four-year-old twins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nestor Bettancourt , a 10-year-old from Austin , demonstrates the manganas a pie , or rope tricks . He twirls a lariat from one side to the other , jumps through the loops , then brings the loop over his head and twirls it horizontally around his body like a hula hoop before jumping outside of the loop . " I love it , " says Nestor , who practices at least one hour a day . " You have this feeling that you want to do it right . Every Sunday we know we 're going to be here . " A few yards away , a young bull starts walking into the parking lot . He bellows angrily , and women grab young children and head for their cars . Clearly , it 's time for these young hombres to put their skills to work . Chief vaquero Jaime gives a war whoop : " Hey guys , we 've got a mission ! " They all run off , throwing their lariats at the bull , who quickly retreats . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2000 . @ @ @ @ @
