The Fistfight : A Primer BY TOM CHIARELLA Do n't . You are smarter than this . There is too much you ca n't control . Even as it starts , know that it will be fast , faster than you could ever imagine and over before you can think much . If it is n't , then you know you are in the middle of some bad news . So just don't. * But if you must , make it faster for him than it is for you . First , look for the door ; do n't let anything start until you can see a clear path to it . * Grab something small and hard that looks menacing  --  car keys , pool balls , beer bottles , highball glasses . * Do n't punch  --  it breaks fingers . Big , bloody compound fractures . Hit with the heel of your palm  --  in the chest , in the lips , or on the nose . * Do n't hit people on other parts of the head . It kills them  --  destroys lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scratching is bad , since it never really hurts the other guy , leaves marks for the cops to see , and leaves the other guy looking like he was beating off a house cat . * Biting , however , is good , especially through clothes , since it always really , really hurts . * Head butts : fine , but be close when you deliver them , aiming for the spot where nose meets forehead . * Elbows are always harder and more effective than you 'd expect . * If you have glasses , take them off . * Do n't fight in your coat . * If you are heavy , use gravity as a muscle , dragging the guy to the floor , but for God 's sake  --  stay on top . * If you are small , make yourself smaller . Crouch . Make one small jab , fucking hard one time , right below the nose , and step back . Retreat , sidestep him , pop him as he misses you . Never let the bigger guy get you down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of kung fu to shout or grunt , but eventually someone will be shrieking or pleading . This must not be you . * If you get the other guy down , end it . Let the crowd pull you off . * Do n't kick him when he 's on the ground , because you can rupture a spleen or break his back . * Do n't use a flourish  --  no pile driver , no knee-drop . Just walk away . * But remember : No one gets knocked out cold like in the movies . A fight is never over . Find the door again and leave . * And tell yourself the truth : You may be smarter now than you were before , but even then you were smart enough never to get in a fight .

ROUNTREE , ATTORNEY-IN-CHARGE , CRIMINAL DEFENSE DIVISION OF THE LEGAL AID SOCIETY IN QUEENS COUNTY , NEW YORK AS TOLD TO BUDDY KITE First , if you 're going to fight , do n't actually use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felony assault , and the charges are distinguished by the seriousness of the injury . A pop in the nose ? That 's a misdemeanor . But with more-serious injuries , the case is elevated and will play out in court . Gather witnesses . Ask them to give their names and numbers to the cops . It 's up to you to get strangers to speak up . You should n't talk to the police . You ca n't explain away what happened to the point where the officer will release you . If you know you 're going to be arrested  --  and it 's almost guaranteed that if the cops show up , you will be  --  tell the cop you 'd like to get a lawyer . At the precinct , call a lawyer or have a relative or friend call one . You will usually be granted this call , but it depends on your behavior . After the arrest is processed , you will be taken to court . It helps to have a friend or relative meet you there . No attitude and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process within twenty-four hours , but if you 're an asshole in their eyes , they can sit on the paperwork . Be deferential . If your lawyer does n't think you have a good self-defense claim , have him negotiate for a dismissal . That way you do n't have to plead guilty to anything . You just accept it with community service or a fine . The Moves BY CHRIS HALL , PERSONAL TRAINER , EXPERT IN BRAZILIAN JUJITSU , KETTLEBELL , AND INDIAN CLUBS How to TAKE DOWN SOMEONE WHO 'S BIGGER THAN YOU 1 . Knock his hands to one side . 2 . When his body turns , put your head outside his front knee and your shoulders into his hips . Wrap your arms just above the back of his knees . 3 . Pull in and to the side . How to ESCAPE A HEADLOCK Turn your head into the crook of his elbow and push it up over your head . HOW YOU SHOULD STAND Crouch low , knees bent and with your hands up , like you 're defending someone in basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crouches low , he 's probably a wrestler or trained in jujitsu . Step back far enough so that he ca n't take a step forward and reach you with an extended arm . If he stands high , he might know judo , boxing , or karate . Step back as above . If he wobbles , he 's just drunk . Buy him another . WHAT I 'VE LEARNED : How to NEGOTIATE BY RICHARD HOLBROOKE , FORMER AMBASSADOR TO THE UN , NEGOTIATOR OF THE 1995 DAYTON AGREEMENT You have to know what the other side needs . I learned a lot from the twelve years I spent on Wall Street before Dayton . Like the " pay or play " principle . You can play that card only once . You ca n't keep bluffing or you become Chicken Little . I do n't try to go fast . I try to match the method to the moment.It 's a negotiation . No side can get 100 percent . Anyone who goes into a negotiation without knowing who 's on the other side is going in blindfolded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study the person on the other side of the table . The CIA does these psychological profiles . They prepared one for me on Milosevic , but it was n't very useful because the people who wrote it had never met him . So what I did was , during the negotiations I spent some of the time talking to him about things other than the issue at hand , to understand what motivated him . If you announce that this is your bottom line , there 's no room to move . If , on the other hand , you talk about flexibility , your opening position is eroded . I spent two years in Morocco as a Peace Corps director , and we used to bargain for rugs in the souk . At a certain point you had to decide whether the merchant had reached his rock-bottom price . You had to decide how much you wanted it and how much it was worth to you . A lot of this is human nature . How to HEAL YOURSELF The Endorsement : The Meat Bandage BY CRAIG DAVIDSON I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so repeatedly that I 've felt the contour of my skull bone buzzing beneath my scalp like an X-ray holograph . Punched with such keen malice , it was as if my nerve stem had been packed with dynamite : ba-boom . One time , this jack roller crushed me one walking out of a bar  --  you could call it a sucker punch , but any fool not six sheets to the wind would have seen it coming , and I was eight sheets gone  --  right along the supraorbital ridge , where socket rings eye , and I experienced this crazy sensation of my eyes bugging out of my head , this telescopic view of the sidewalk , curbed cars , the moon and stars . You may have heard that a steak is a fine way to remedy a black eye . The truth , however , is that steak possesses no magical enzymes that cut down on the swelling or discoloration occasioned by the pugilistic happenstance known as five-to-the-eye . In fact , a pair of brisket goggles may make things worse : Bacteria from the meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a serious infection . But as I fancy myself somewhat old school in both my fighting style ( my idol : 1800s bare-knuckle champ Peter " Young Rump Steak " Crawley ) and prefight routines ( hands soaked in skin-toughening walnut juice ) , it should come as no surprise that I use the steak remedy myself , albeit in bowdlerized fashion . WHAT YOU 'LL NEED : 1 steak . A skirt cut is my favorite . 1 meat tenderizer . Meat mallet if you have one . I use a recoilless hammer . 1 bag frozen vegetables . Smaller the better . Peas are good . 1 Ace bandage . PROCESS : Tenderize steak until it is roughly half an inch thick . Wash in hot water , using dish soap . Rinse thoroughly . Place over your punch-blackened eye , followed by bag of frozen vegetables . Wrap tightly with Ace bandage looped from forehead to base of skull . Vow revenge . Fall asleep watching an infomercial for the Popeil rotisserie . MEDICAL LOGIC : The only way to combat a black eye is with cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms a buffer between skin and frozen vegetables  --  the true curative . Steak form-fits the swollen eye and distributes the cold to allow for prolonged icing . Plus , a slab of meat on your mug will go a lot further toward easing your bruised manhood than a bag of baby bok choy ever could . <p>
