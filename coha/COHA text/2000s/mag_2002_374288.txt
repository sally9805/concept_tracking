On a Saturday morning in December , TIME brought Coleen Rowley of the FBI , Cynthia Cooper of WorldCom and Sherron Watkins of Enron together to talk , for the first time , about their parallel experiences over the past year . The women had never met before , but over breakfast they compared stories and marveled at the similarities : their motivations for exposing the flaws of their institutions , their shock at having their secret actions exposed and then condemned in some quarters , and their enduring love for the ideals of their workplaces . They also discovered they shared much in their personal lives , and they enjoyed cheering one another on . The following is an excerpt of their conversation : <P> TIME : How do you explain why so many people at your organizations did not do what you did ? <P> WATKINS : I think it 's the value system at the top . Cooper and Rowley are nodding . It 's very important that the leaders set the tone . Remember the Tylenol-tampering scare ? It threw the company into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , supposedly , and said , " I just looked at our value statement . We have got to do the right thing . We are pulling every bottle of Tylenol off the shelves worldwide . " It cost them $300 million to do , but they set the standard for tamper-resistant products , and in the long run he saved consumer loyalty . <P> TIME : Do you believe you three have become standard setters ? <P> ROWLEY : That 's the chairman of the board . I am way down the order . All you can do from the lower echelon is try . <P> TIME : Why did n't those at the upper echelons try ? Or admit their mistakes ? <P> WATKINS : It 's ingrained in human nature to fight and argue . My 3-year-old Marion wo n't say she 's sorry . She 'll sit in time-out forever . <P> ROWLEY : It 's even worse in the U.S. , with the adversary system and hiring lawyers . No one does anything wrong anymore . <P> TIME : If the culture comes from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall prey to it ? <P> COOPER : I think it comes back to values and ethics that you learn through your life . My mother has been a tremendous influence on me : " Never allow yourself to be intimidated ; always think about the consequences of your actions . " I think this is a wake-up call for the country . There 's a responsibility for all Americans  --  teachers , mothers , fathers , college professors , corporate people  --  to help and make sure the moral and ethical fabric of the country is strong . <P> ROWLEY : Stands up and bursts into applause I do n't care if you 're an FBI agent or a priest or a government official . We are all human , and we are all susceptible to any number of vices and mistakes . All we can do is try to uncover and correct them . <P> WATKINS : If you just say , " I have this admission or I did this wrong , I am sorry , " human nature is to say , " I understand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they 're wrong ? <P> ROWLEY : After a pause I 'm trying to think if I have ever been wrong . Laughter all around . I do n't think I am exceptional . I think everyone makes mistakes . <P> TIME : You 've all spoken about the importance of role models . Who were yours ?
