In the fading light , two flatbed trucks trundle slowly up the highway from Basra to Baghdad , bearing a precarious cargo : a pair of Soviet-era T-52 tanks , their long gun barrels pointed defiantly at the sky . Rumor has it that Iraqi heavy armor is deliberately being moved around in full display to allay public concerns about the army 's fighting capabilities . If that is indeed the intention , then the T-52s are being hauled in the wrong direction . The folks who most need that kind of reassurance are the citizens of Basra . <P> Iraq 's southernmost city is just an hour 's drive from Kuwait . If the U.S. goes to war with Iraq , American forces will almost surely secure Basra early on as they push north toward Baghdad . They will want a continuing presence in the area to keep potentially rebellious Iraqi Shi'ites , who are concentrated around Basra , under control . And if the stories about Saddam Hussein 's scorched-earth strategy are true , then Basra , ringed as it is with oil fields , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're heading for a disaster , " says surgeon Akram Hamoodi , director of the Saddam Teaching Hospital , the city 's largest . " We 're doing whatever we can to prepare for it . And we 're praying a lot . " <P> It 's a familiar predicament for Basra . Strategically poised on the bank of the Shatt al Arab , one of the Middle East 's busiest waterways , the city has been a juicy target for raiders , including the Persians , Turks and British , for more than 600 years . It was heavily shelled by the Iranians during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war . In the 1991 Gulf War , allied forces controlled access to the city but did not need to enter it in strength ; the Iraqi army had pulled out without much of a fight . Could Iraqi soldiers turn and run again ? That 's a prospect nobody here wants to contemplate . " It 's not possible , " says Hamoodi . " I ca n't imagine that the army will allow Basra to be separated from Iraq . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum of fuss , Basra is preparing for a prolonged conflict . The hospital is building up its blood bank , aiming for at least a month 's supply of 100 pints daily , from the normal demand of 20 pints . " The one good thing about the war with Iran is that it made us experts at this kind of situation , " Hamoodi says . <P> In recent weeks , free government rations of such essentials as flour , rice , sugar and tea have been doubled to allow for household stockpiling . Remembering the fuel shortages of 1991 , many Basrans are hoarding gasoline and cooking gas as well . It 's accepted wisdom that power stations would be destroyed in the first wave of U.S. bombing , so the longest , most chaotic lines in the city are at the kerosene depots , where residents bring every kind of container  --  from soft-drink bottles to steel drums  --  to fill up with fuel for lamps and stoves . <P> The one thing people are n't doing is leaving . Basrans know that the army would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people go ? " During the war with Iran , people sent their children to the north , away from the front lines , " says Abdul-Razak Mohamed , vice president of Basra University . " But now no place is safe from American bombs . "
