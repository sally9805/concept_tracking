At Caltech , the most eggheaded college in America , they love numbers the way moles love dirt , so here goes : // Number of Nobel Prize winners on the faculty : 5 . Number of players on the basketball team who had a perfect SAT score : 2 . Years since the hoops team won an NCAA game : 12. // Forget that . It 's been 21 years since Caltech , a Division III school in Pasadena , won a Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference game . Would n't you think just once a ball would bounce off a pocket protector and in for a win ? // " We think too much , " says Roy Dow , the Beavers ' coach . // That 's true . Every player on the team can tell you the optimum launch angle , parabola and velocity of a three-pointer . They just ca n't make one . // Not that Caltech does n't have a rich athletic tradition . During halftime of the 1961 Rose Bowl thousands of kids in the Washington student section were duped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out HUSKIES but instead spelled CALTECH . At the 1984 Rose Bowl , Caltech students hacked into the scoreboard by remote and changed it to read Caltech 38 , MIT 9 . There is a T-shirt you can buy in the university bookstore that reads CALTECH FOOTBALL UNDEFEATED SINCE ? 1993 . Possibly because Caltech has n't had a football team since 1993. // But winning games instead of mocking them ? They 'll find the 10th planet before that happens . ( Oops ! A Caltech professor just did that. ) // Do you have any idea how difficult it is to get decent basketball players into a school this hard ? // " I search all around the country , trying to find a few good players who could get in here , " says Dow , who has eight high school valedictorians on his squad , " but as soon as I hear they 've gotten a B , it 's , ' See ya ! ' " // Only six guys on his roster even played varsity ball in high school . Nobody on the team got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has dunked in his Caltech career . // The team 's best player , senior Jordan Carlson , who 's a theoretical physics major , figures he does schoolwork 14 hours a day . What 's so important at school ? " Well , " he says , " an interesting question we 're studying now is how mass is generated in terms of quantum field theory . " // Oh , sure , the Kentucky players were discussing that the other day . // In his four seasons Dow has seen it all . One kid closed his eyes when he shot . One did n't know if he was left-or righthanded . One current player puts topspin on his jumpers . " Must be some sort of physics I 'm not aware of , " Dow says . // So I went to Pasadena last week to see the Beavers put their epic losing streak on the line against Rivier College of Nashua , N.H. Three things you notice right away : // 1 ) Caltech has the world 's most optimistic statistician . The stat sheet has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping track of how many Oscars she 's won . // 2 ) Caltech players are so skinny they look like they could be knocked over by a butterfly 's burp . // 3 ) Caltech has no cheerleaders . But would n't it be great ? // Molecules , slide rules Watt , ampere ! Fill that cylinder With that sphere ! // But the Beavers do hustle , make smart passes and run their motion offense as smoothly as a gyroscope . That 's how , with 90 seconds left , they actually led Rivier by four . And the only thing the crowd could think was , O.K. , which of these brainiacs is messing with the scoreboard again ? // Alas , Rivier started pouring in threes , and Caltech started spitting out turnovers , and when Carlson 's last-second 30-footer just missed , Caltech had lost its 181st straight NCAA game 55-54 . ( The Beavers have since lost two more. ) // Hey , at least it was close . Two years ago they lost by an average of 59 points a game . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proudly , " has gone from impossible to improbable . " // Not that it made the pizza afterward any easier to swallow . " I thought we were going to give you something to write about , " Carlson said glumly . // You get the feeling , with kids as smart as this , they will . As an opposing player -- whose team had just slaughtered the Beavers -- said as he shook each Caltech player 's hand , " Now go cure cancer for us. " // ?
