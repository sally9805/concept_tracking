" You 're not going to find anyone , you crazy dog . " Jude Marrok climbed over another pile of rubble , trying to keep up with the black Lab . " And I 'm not going to keep on chasing after you . I 'll give you fifteen more minutes . After that , I 'm calling the helicopter . " <p> <p> Ned did n't even look back as he sniffed desperately at the remains of houses toppled by the earthquake . He was making soft , whimpering noises as he searched the ruins for life . <p> <p> Marrok muttered a curse beneath his breath . Dammit , he should have taken the dog down to the main rescue area after they 'd been dropped by the helicopter in the foothills . This side of the mountain had already been searched by the canine rescue teams . <p> <p> When the volcano on this small Caribbean island had caused a 7.5 earthquake six days ago , it had devastated the two villages on both slopes of the mountain . The rescue teams had worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found , they had abandoned this smaller village to concentrate on the one on the far side of the mountain . His dog , Ned , had refused to go to the other side of the mountain and insisted on going to the now-deserted village , and Marrok had gone along with him . Most of the time the Lab 's instincts were pretty good , and it was n't that unusual for him to find survivors after other rescue teams had abandoned hope . But they 'd been searching for two hours , and Ned had not found any signs of life . <p> <p> And the blasted dog would n't give up . The longer he searched , the more frantic he was becoming . He was whimpering now , and if he started barking , it could bring the soldiers who were guarding the ruins from vandals and looters . That could n't happen . Jude had n't had time to get papers when he decided to bring Ned to the disaster site . He 'd put the usual Red Cross halter jacket on Ned , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the hell . He 'd worry about being thrown in the local hoosegow if it happened . After all , he 'd brought Ned here to put a stop to the depression he 'd noticed in him for the last few weeks , and he 'd stay the course . The dog 's depression used to be present only after he 'd gone to a site and found nothing but the dead , but lately he always seemed to be waiting for any opportunity to make the attempt at rescue . <p> <p> Ned had stopped at a heap of timber and turned his head to stare at him with pleading dark eyes . <p> <p> " Okay , I 'll take a look . " He began to pull aside the debris . " But do n't get your hopes up , buddy . " He worked for fifteen minutes , and all the while Ned just sat gazing anxiously at him . " I told you . You know how many times it turns out that  --  " He stopped . " Shit . " <p> <p> Ned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Dead . " The villager he 'd uncovered was lying crumpled , his skull crushed . Poor bastard . " I told you . Now let 's go to the other side of the mountain where we have a chance of finding  --  " <p> <p> Ned lifted his head and howled . <p> <p> " No . " Marrok fell to his knees and put his arms around the Lab . " Shhh , I know it hurts . Me , too . But you have to be quiet , Ned . We 're not supposed to be here . " Ned was whimpering again , but at least he was n't howling any longer . He buried his nose against Marrok 's chest . " We 'll keep looking . You 'll find someone alive . I promise . " He hoped he was telling the truth . It was breaking his heart to see Ned grieving . He stroked the dog 's head . " Come on . We 'll go and join the rescue teams on the other side of the mountain . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> And Marrok would be walking a tightrope and have to lie himself blue in the face if he was challenged by anyone . Well , it was n't as if that would be unfamiliar territory . He had become an expert at both over the years . Ned was worth any amount of trouble he had to face . He got to his feet . " Let 's go , " he said gently . " No reason for staying here . We ca n't help him . " He put a marker on the spot for body retrieval . " It will be better if we  --  " <p> <p> Ned was no longer beside him . He was running across the rubble , his lean midnight-black body taut with eagerness . He had caught another scent , Marrok realized , and he was following it with reckless speed . It seemed the dog was n't ready to obey him , he thought ruefully . It was n't surprising since their relationship was that of close friends rather than master and canine . They had long ago passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for a while . " He took off after Ned . " But you 'd better be right this time . I ca n't spend all night comforting you . " But he knew he 'd do precisely that . You did n't question when a friend was in need . He 'd almost caught up with Ned , and the Lab was staring at him hopefully . " Let 's make a deal . " He started to bend to shift the debris . " If we do n't find anyone this time , you give it up and do it my  --  " <p> <p> A whistle of sound streaked by his cheek . <p> <p> Ned cried out and fell to the ground , blood pouring from his side . <p> <p> A bullet , dammit . <p> <p> Marrok fell sideways , grabbed Ned 's collar , and rolled with him behind the ruin of the house . <p> <p> Another bullet splintered the timber next to Marrok as he pulled out his gun . It had come from the direction of the trees to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have questioned him before shooting at him . That Red Cross on Ned 's halter would have required it . His gaze searched the trees as he moved to the side . <p> <p> Another bullet . <p> <p> One shooter and determined to make the kill . <p> <p> Danner ? Maybe . God , he 'd hoped he 'd sidetracked them in Morocco , but they must have uncovered his trail . The solution was the same as always . Kill the shooter . Disappear . It would take time for them to send someone else on his trail . But he could n't leave Ned . The Lab was hurt and bleeding . He could n't take time to go after the shooter . Not now . He had to stop Ned 's bleeding and get him help . <p> <p> He dodged two bullets while he dragged Ned farther behind the timbers . He sprayed a barrage of bullets at the trees before starting work to stop the bleeding . There was n't much , thank God . Ned lay still , only whimpering occasionally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't tell in the darkness . Anger exploded through him . <p> <p> Come after me , you son of a bitch . Let me have my chance at you . <p> <p> Shoot my dog ? I 'll tear your heart out . <p> <p> But he could hear voices coming from the direction of the rescue site on the other side of the mountain . Someone had heard the shots , dammit . He was n't going to get his opportunity to make the kill . The shooter would n't risk going after him and exposing himself to awkward questions . Danner did n't like questions . <p> <p> He stroked Ned 's head . " It 's going to be okay . We 'll get you fixed up . There 's almost always a vet on these mercy missions . " He glanced at the trees from where the bullet had come . It was only a postponement . The shooter would n't give up . He 'd stick around and wait for another opportunity to take them out . Danner disliked failure almost as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll make sure that bastard never has another go at you . " <p> <p> SHIT .. <p> <p> Kingston lowered his Remington , slid down the trunk of the palm tree , and sprinted back into the woods . He 'd go back and cover his tracks later . He was n't worried about the locals hunting him down . Marrok was the threat . Kingston had read every word of the report Danner had given him on the man who called himself Jude Marrok , and some of it was very impressive . <p> <p> His phone vibrated in his jacket pocket . He pulled it out and checked the ID . Danner . <p> <p> Dammit , he was tempted to ignore it . He did n't want to have to give explanations right now . But he could n't ignore a man who wielded as much power as Raymond Danner . <p> <p> He punched the button . <p> <p> " I 'm a little busy . I 'll call you back . " <p> <p> " Did you get him ? " Raymond Danner asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> " Dead ? " <p> <p> " I 'm not sure . Marrok got in my way at the last minute . " <p> <p> Silence . " You shot Marrok ? " <p> <p> " No , " he said quickly . " I was trying to lure him into a trap , but then the soldiers  --  " <p> <p> Danner began to curse . " My God , ca n't you do anything right ? I even told you where Marrok and the dog would be to night . All you had to do was go in and get them . " <p> <p> " I was waiting on the other side of the mountain where all the other rescue teams were working . He did n't go where you said he was going . I had to reposition . " He quickly added , " But I 'll stake out the area and watch for the helicopter . There are military units all over this mountain , so he may not be able to get the copter back into the area . If the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . Do n't worry , Marrok wo n't get away from me . " <p> <p> " I 'm not worried . I 'm pissed . That damn savage Marrok was a SEAL and has wriggled his way out of a dozen traps . You had a chance if you took him by surprise . I want the job done before Marrok leaves that disaster site . " Danner hung up . <p> <p> Kingston pressed the disconnect . He could feel his heart pounding . He 'd seen Danner angry before and the results were n't pretty . He liked to make examples that stayed in the memories of the men around him . <p> <p> Move . Avoid those soldiers . <p> <p> Find Marrok . <p> <p> Find the dog . <p> <p> " WAKE UP , DEVON . " NICK was shaking her . " I just got a call from Captain Ramirez . They 're bringing in a wounded dog to the first-aid tent . " <p> <p> Devon Brady shook her head to clear it of sleep . Lord , she felt groggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching for survivors until almost midnight . She glanced at the clock . It was after two . " I thought I was the last one to break for the night . Whose dog was hurt ? Jerry ? His shepherd has a history of hip injuries . " <p> <p> " No . " Nick Gilroy handed her the shirt and khakis , which were draped over the chair in her mobile quarters . " It 's a Lab . Captain Ramirez said he was shot . " <p> <p> " Shot ? " Her lips tightened as she started to dress . " Did the soldiers do it ? Some gun-happy kid who thought he saw a wolf ? " <p> <p> " The captain swears it was n't one of his men . They heard gunfire and went to investigate . " Nick found her shoes under the bed and handed them to her . " The dog was wounded , and the man who was with him did n't give them a chance to ask questions . He said he wanted his dog taken care of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuse them of shooting a rescue dog . " <p> <p> Lab . She put on her shoes . The only Lab on the rescue team belonged to Phil Dormhaus . Phil was a quiet , intellectual type , and she could n't imagine him threatening or making a stink about anything . He was a man who did his job , then took his dog home . But what did she know ? She thought wearily . The dogs were n't the only rescue casualties at a disaster like this . The owners of the search and rescue dogs could take only so much death , so much sorrow before they started to break , too . This had been a rough mission , and it still was n't over . Maybe Phil had been so grief-stricken at the wounding of his dog that he had slipped over the edge . " If the soldiers did n't shoot the Lab , it must have been done by one of the civilians here on the island . Tell the captain that whoever did it has to be found and thrown into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help them . I wo n't have our dogs endangered . " <p> <p> " I 'll tell him . My pleasure . " Nick smiled . " Do you need any help with the Lab ? " <p> <p> " I do n't know . " She looked back at him as she opened the door of the trailer . Sometimes she forgot that Nick was n't a young man any longer . He was in his sixties but still strong and agile . She 'd taken over his veterinary practice several years ago . Nick had planned on retiring but instead had stayed on and become her right hand . They had worked together for so many years that they took each other for granted . Yet to night she could see the signs of wear and tear this mission had imprinted on him ; his gray hair was tousled and on end , and his face was lined with weariness . " After you talk to the captain , go back to bed . Take Gracie with you . She needs the rest more than I do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " She glanced at her greyhound , Gracie , who was beginning to get to her feet . " No , stay with Nick , baby . I 'll be right back . " She started down the steps . " I 'll call you if I need you , Nick . " <p> <p> He nodded as he yawned . " I know you will . You would n't let a dog be given less care than he deserves even if neither of us got any sleep . " <p> <p> " We can say no , " she said quietly . " Most of the time a dog wo n't do that . You know they give until they ca n't give any longer . " She closed the door behind her and strode toward the first-aid tent across the camp . There were only a handful of people on the site at this hour . A mechanic working on the crane . A woman clerk sitting at a desk in the makeshift morgue going through records . A few soldiers standing outside the first-aid tent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood was quiet , somber . The canine rescue part of the operation was winding down , and they only had one more day of work before they went home . The handlers and dogs were sleeping , trying to rest their bodies as well as their dogs so they could function efficiently in the morning for one more push , one more effort . She hoped Gracie would get a good sleep . The greyhound was always restless on a search and rescue , and she liked to be in the same room as Devon . But the dog knew Nick and Devon had no choice . She had to help Phil 's Lab and probably Phil himself . He 'd need someone to talk to and comfort if the Lab was badly hurt . <p> <p> As she drew nearer to the tent , she could see a man in a black shirt standing over the examining table . Phil ? <p> <p> No . Phil had narrow shoulders and brown hair . This man was tall , lean , with broad shoulders , and sleek black hair cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she was sure she had never seen him before . Nor had she seen the black Lab lying on the table . Her gaze instantly zeroed in on the hurt animal , her attention focusing on the wounded dog . The owner must have taken off the dog 's bloodstained halter with the Red Cross on the side because it was lying on the floor beside the table . That would help . She would n't have to struggle to get a pain-crazed dog quiet enough to  --  <p> <p> " You 're the vet ? " The dog 's owner had turned as she entered the tent . " My dog 's hurt . The bullet is still in him . You need to get it out . " <p> <p> " I will . " She came forward . " I 'm Devon Brady . Who are you ? " <p> <p> " Jude Marrok . I stopped the bleeding , and I do n't think he 's badly hurt . But I want that bullet out . I ca n't move him with it in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner she 'd expected to see when she walked into the tent . His voice was crisp , cool , and his tone demanding . To hell with him . " I told you I 'd take it out . But not until I take some X-rays and see where it is and if it clipped an organ . " <p> <p> " It has n't . " He pointed to the wound . " Close . But it missed it . It would have done more damage if the bullet had been a higher caliber . I think you 'll find it 's a 7.62 millimeter . It was meant for distance accuracy . From the sound of it , I 'd say it came from a Remington M-24 . " <p> <p> " Sound ? " <p> <p> " Like an M-16 , but duller . It 's used as a sniper weapon . " <p> <p> " I doubt it was that kind of weapon . " She was examining the wound . The dog was amazingly docile . He was fully awake , but he only gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't equipped with that kind of firepower . It 's probably a hunting rifle . " <p> <p> " It 's a Remington , " he said flatly . " I 've heard that sound too many times to make a mistake . Now get that bullet out of him . " <p> <p> " Stop giving me orders . " She tried to keep the edge from her voice . She wheeled the portable X-ray unit toward the table . " I 'm tired , and I 'm giving up my few hours of sleep before I have to be up and starting the search again . This is our last day here , and we do n't have much time left . They do n't think we have a chance of finding anyone else , and we have orders to fly out this evening . " She covered the dog with the protector cover . He seemed fully aware , but he still did n't move . Amazing . " I 'm doing this willingly because most dogs are worth more than their masters . You included . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shut up . " <p> <p> He stared at her for a moment . " Sorry . " He took a step closer to the table . " I wo n't give you orders , but you may need me to help with Ned . No one knows him better than I do . He 'll do what I tell him . " <p> <p> " His name is Ned ? " She pushed the X-ray machine out of the way and moved to the examining table . She gently stroked the Lab 's black head . " Hello , Ned , " she said softly . " I 'm Devon , and I 'm going to help you . I 'll try not to hurt you , but if I do , I 'll take it away as quick as I can . " <p> <p> The Lab made a sound deep in his throat and pushed his head against her hand . His brown eyes gazed up at her with trust and a sort of fearless understanding . Surprise rippled through her . She was n't sure she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . knowing . <p> <p> " What a good boy . " She felt a sudden surge of anger . And some idiot villager had tried to kill this animal , who 'd only tried to help . What kind of world was this ? " Do n't worry , the soldiers will find out who shot him . Most of the time the villagers are grateful . I do n't know why one of them went crazy . " <p> <p> " It was n't a local . " Marrok was watching her expression . " But you look like you 'd like to go hunting for the bastard who shot Ned . " <p> <p> " I would . " Her lips tightened . " And if Captain Ramirez starts giving me excuses about not finding him , I will . He ca n't get away with shooting my dogs . " <p> <p> " Your dogs ? " <p> <p> " I 'm the vet on-site . All these rescue dogs may not belong to me , but their health is my responsibility . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X-ray . " And why the hell have n't I seen you and Ned on the mountain ? You do n't belong to any of the U.S. rescue groups that I flew in with . " <p> <p> " I do n't belong to a group . Ned and I are sort of . . . freelance . " <p> <p> " Freelance ? No way . Do you think I 'm stupid ? You have to have government permission even to enter the area . They would n't approve anyone not sponsored and approved by a government . " <p> <p> " We were here . We were doing a job . " He met her eyes . " Now why do n't you do your job ? Take that bullet out of Ned . " <p> <p> He was right . The barely contained violence that glimmered beneath Marrok 's cool exterior might be antagonizing her and filling her with suspicion , but she could deal with it later . She was n't about to put him through a third degree until she finished taking care of the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You appear to have guessed right . The bullet is n't lodged in a vital organ . " <p> <p> " No guess . I told you that no one knows Ned like I do . Anesthesia ? " <p> <p> " Of course . " <p> <p> " I do n't like anesthesia . " He lifted his hand to ward off the words he knew she was going to say . " I 'm not suggesting you cut into him without it . He 'll need it for the initial pain . But I want you to use PropoFlo and work fast . He 'll come out of it quicker , and he 'll be himself again . That 's important in Ned 's case . " <p> <p> " It 's sometimes better for them to have a heavier sedation . They do n't try to struggle after they wake and break the stitches . " <p> <p> " He wo n't struggle . I 'll explain it to him . " <p> <p> Her brows lifted . " You may believe he 's very intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " He wo n't struggle . " He met her gaze . " I promise you . I 'll be right here when he wakes to quiet him if he does . " <p> <p> She shrugged . She preferred to use PropoFlo anyway whenever possible . Ned 's calm temperament seemed to make him a good candidate . " I 'll take care of him if there 's a problem . You do n't have to be here . " <p> <p> " Yes , I do . " He turned to the dog and began to murmur to him . It was n't English , Devon realized with surprise . She studied him . Even though Marrok was olive-complexioned and his hair and eyes were also dark , she had been sure he was American . High cheekbones , wide mouth . . . Italian ? Spanish ? No , neither one . But the dog seemed to understand . He was staring intently at Marrok 's face , and when the words stopped , he closed his eyes with a little sigh . <p> <p> Marrok turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get this over . I have something I have to do . " <p> <p> " It will take as long as it takes . " She went to the medicine supply chest . " If you 're going to stay , scrub up and  --  " <p> <p> " Wait . There 's something you should know . " <p> <p> " Medical history ? " <p> <p> " No , Ned thought he found a survivor just before he was shot . I did n't get a chance to search the ruins of that house , so I do n't know if he was right . I flagged the site . " <p> <p> She shook her head . " That entire village was searched thoroughly before we pulled out a few days ago . " <p> <p> Marrok shrugged . " Ned is n't always right , but he comes close . It 's your call . " <p> <p> She hesitated . " Did you tell Captain Ramirez ? " <p> <p> He nodded . " Like you , he did n't believe there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put into that village . " <p> <p> " There 's always a chance . " She frowned . " I 'll call Ramirez and tell him that we need to get an excavation crew up there right away . I 'll go myself after I finish with your Ned . " <p> <p> An indecipherable expression flitted across his face . " It would be better if you stayed here . It might not be safe for you up there . " <p> <p> " Of course I 'm going . It 's what I do . " She looked up at him . " Do you think  --  " She forgot what she had been about to say as her eyes met Marrok 's . His intensity was overwhelming and almost hypnotizing . For an instant she actually felt shaken . Safe ? She suddenly had the feeling that nothing connected with this man would ever be termed safe . <p> <p> Get a grip . Whether Marrok was safe or not was n't important . He was just a man with a dog that was hurt and needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's what I do , " she repeated . She took out her phone and started to dial Ramirez . " Put on some gloves . I may need you to hold Ned in the correct position during the surgery .
