<p> When John Fizer was 13 years old , he watched on television as 21-year-old Tiger Woods triumphed in the 1997 Masters by a record-breaking 12 shots . It was the first victory by an African American in any of golf 's four major championships , and Fizer felt inspired . <p> " I definitely identified with him right off the bat , " said Fizer , an African American who recently completed his college golf career at Virginia . " Him winning the Masters was the turning point for me in golf . I had also played baseball and basketball when I was a kid . When he won , that 's when I knew this was what I wanted to do . I decided I was going to focus on golf . It had a huge impact on me , very definitely . " <p> Later this summer , Fizer will move to South Florida , where he will spend a year trying to become good enough to play on the PGA Tour . An exception already , he 's well aware that the odds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woods was born , there were 12 African-American players on the PGA Tour . Ten years after Woods turned professional in the summer of 1996 , Woods is the only African-American player on the PGA Tour . <p> From 1964 to 1986 , five African Americans  --  Washingtonian Lee Elder , Charlie Sifford , Jim Thorpe , Calvin Peete and Pete Brown  --  won a total of 23 PGA tournaments . No black player other than Woods , with 48 career victories , has won on the tour since 1986 . <p> This week , Woods will be the only African-American player playing in the U.S. Open at Winged Foot , America 's national championship of golf . There are currently no African Americans on the LPGA Tour , only one African American  --  33-year-old Jackson State graduate Tim O'Neal  --  on the feeder Nationwide Tour and two part-time African-American players on the women 's Futures Tour . O'Neal missed earning his PGA Tour card by a single shot in the 2005 qualifying event . <p> " Am I disappointed ? Yeah , " Woods said before last year 's U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of us out here , but then again , it 's a matter of getting enough players . You have to have a big enough base . At the junior level , there are some players with some talent , but as you continue to play and continue to move up levels , the screening process kind of weeds them out . <p> " It 's hard to make it out here . A lot of these kids do n't have the opportunity to practice and play and compete around the country in junior golf events or individual amateur events . I 've seen enough of them in college , and I 'm excited about that , getting an education and getting an opportunity to further themselves from that aspect , but we do n't have a big enough base for them to have an opportunity to get out here . " <p> When Woods took the golf world by storm 10 years ago , his late father , Earl , and many others predicted his success would help pave the way for young minorities to take up a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has happened , to an extent . According to the National Golf Foundation 's most recent study in 2003 , more than 882,000 African Americans were playing golf in 1999 , and that figure increased by 47 percent by 2003 , when 1.3 million African Americans were playing the sport  --  5 percent of the country 's black population 6 percent of all American golfers . A similar trend was seen among Asian Americans : More than 1.1 million were playing in 2003 , up from 851,000 in 1997 . <p> But that has n't translated into more faces of color playing regularly on the country 's top professional tours . Nor is the huge increase in black recreational golfers reflected in the scarcity of African Americans holding meaningful positions in the nation 's leading golf organizations . <p> The U.S. Golf Association , the sport 's governing body in North America , has no African-American officers and only one African American on its 16-person executive committee . <p> The PGA Tour 's 20-man board of directors has one African American , Carl Ware of Atlanta . There also is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour 's 2006 media guide , Don Wallace , director of operations for its Shotlink computerized scoring and hole-by-hole tracking system . <p> The PGA of America , the organization representing America 's club and teaching professionals , has no African Americans on its 17-person board of directors and one African American , Earnie Ellison , director of business and community relations , among 30 staff directors pictured in its current media guide . The LPGA , which has n't had a black player regularly on tour since 2002 , has no African Americans on its board of directors ( 13 ) , none on its senior staff ( 5 ) and none on its tournament operations staff ( 13 ) . <p> In the PGA of America 's most recent survey , 22,000 of 28,000 members responded . Among those 22,000 , 61 were African-American professional members , and 80 were African-American apprentice professionals . But executive director Joe Steranka , now in his first year on the job , said the organization 's goal is to increase the number of all minorities and women in its membership to 2,200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious of having people of color and women involved in every facet of the PGA of America , " he said . " Our track record of growing diversity in the game and the business of golf is substantive , as well . . . Can we do better ? Absolutely . It 's important to us . " <p> Over the past decade , the most ambitious initiative to raise the number of minorities playing golf has been the PGA Tour 's First Tee program . The initial mission was to take the game to areas where golf was not all that accessible , particularly the inner cities , while also teaching educational and life skills . <p> Headed by Joe Louis Barrow , the son of heavyweight champion Joe Louis , The First Tee had 217,000 participants in 2005 and has 250 U.S. facilities , most with learning centers such as the one at Langston Golf Club in Northeast Washington . But in its most recent annual review , The First Tee reported that only 26 percent of its participants from 2001 to 2005 were African-American , with 51 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian American . <p> " We 've had a lot of success helping kids go on to college and some even playing college golf , " said Jimmy Garvin , who runs Langston and oversees a variety of programs for youngsters at the course . " But there 's so much more we should be doing , because at some point , the game starts to get very expensive , and it 's extremely difficult to get the kind of training you need to make it to the top . " <p> Said Bill Dickey , who has run a longtime Phoenix-based college scholarship program for young minority golfers : " The First Tee takes a lot of these kids only so far . We get some of these kids to a certain level , but then when they need to start playing in all those junior events on a national level , when they need more sophisticated instruction , how do we do it ? Where does the money and the support come from ? That 's what we 've got to figure out . I 'd like to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you the truth . But that is n't happening . " <p> Barrow maintains it will only be a matter of time before First Tee graduates begin to make their mark in the professional game . <p> " I 'm seeing a lot more young African-American people playing high school golf , " he said . " I see more moving on to college golf . We 're seeing more African-American and Hispanic kids in the American Junior Golf Association AJGA events . The pipeline is starting . Earl Woods said when we started we needed to give it time . It took us 20 years to get Tiger where he is now . <p> " Let 's face it , the old feeder system that produced guys like Charlie Sifford and Lee Elder went away . I 'm talking about caddie programs that used to give African Americans their first real access to the game . We 're starting to see a little resurgence in caddie programs around the country . And whether young people playing college golf have the ability and the perseverance to get to a higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are other discouraging numbers , as well . According to the AJGA , which has a weekly national ranking of junior players from 12 to 18 , not one African American is in the top 100 for boys in that age group . The highest-ranked junior girl is Cheyenne Woods of Phoenix , Tiger 's niece , at No. 25 , and the only other African-American girl ranked in the top 100 is No. 75 Jennifer Adyorough of Atlanta . <p> " I 'm not sure that we 're doing anything wrong in golf ; it 's just the other sports are doing better than we are at attracting minority kids and keeping them , " said Stephen Hamblin , executive director of the AJGA . " So many of these teams sports are organized at such an early level . My own daughter played soccer at age four . They give them uniforms , all their friends play , they do things that are cool and fun . Golf has n't really done that . <p> " Cost is also a factor , though that was more true four of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so junior golfers can now get expenses paid for traveling to tournaments , getting reimbursed for meals and lodging and accepting free equipment . We have a program Achieving Competitive Excellence , or ACE where a financially disadvantaged kid can apply for a grant of $4,500 a year to play national junior golf . We award 50 of them . There are many ways to address these expenses . " <p> At the college level , Kevin Hall of Ohio State , an African-American player who also is deaf , won the Big Ten championship two years ago and is now playing mini-tour golf . But Dickey said he sees very few African-American players competing in the upper echelon Division I programs , and also has noticed a distressing trend on golf teams representing many of the nation 's historically black colleges . At the recent National Minority College Golf Championship , conducted by the PGA of America in West Palm Beach , Fla. , a number of schools fielded teams filled with white players , most of them recruited outside the United States . <p> " I would say the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , " said Eddie Payton , the golf coach at Jackson State and brother of the late Walter Payton . " The minority pool of golfers is so small , every year you 've got maybe a one in five chance to get a top minority kid in your program . So now you might go to Australia , where the No. 200 kid in the country is probably better than anyone you can get , and you bring him in . It helps the school in its own diversity goals , and it sure as hell helps your team . " <p> Payton , who has seven African Americans and one Hispanic-American player on his own team , is not yet ready to describe the First Tee as a failure , but he also knows much more can and must be done to change the numbers of minorities on the PGA and LPGA tours . <p> " Sure there are more kids interested because of Tiger Woods , " Payton said . " But the original problems still exist . There are not a lot of very good junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academies to take some of these promising minority players and give them the kind of instruction they need to play on a national level . Until we address those problems , we 'll never see the amount of minorities playing at the highest levels that I 'd like to see . " <p> Payton and Dickey said they also believe Woods has already done his part to bring more African Americans into the game . They applauded his new $25 million learning center in his native Southern California , where academics and learning life skills are emphasized over golf , and they reject any notion that Woods could be doing more to make sure more African Americans advance to the professional tours in the future . <p> " Is it Tiger 's fault there are n't any more playing with him ? " Payton said . " No . It 's our fault as a race , and the golf industry 's problem if they do n't see it as a necessity . It 's hard to mandate to an individual what he should be doing , because it 's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he wants to do it . But the way I look at , we are basically where we were 10 years ago when Tiger first came out on the tour . It 's still an uphill battle , and we have a long way to go . " <p> Meantime , John Fizer knows the journey he is just beginning will not be easy . His father , a dentist practicing in Trenton , N.J. , introduced him to the game when he was 8 years old . His parents have always provided financial support and will stake him to the $25,000 he estimates he 'll need to move to Florida , find a place to practice and pay the entry fees for mini-tour events for six months . <p> " I want to give myself a year to work on my game , " he said . " If I do n't see some results in the next two or three years , I 'll look at other avenues . I want to stay involved with the game , whether it 's playing , working in the golf business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructors or black players as role models . Tiger obviously is one . But he 's also a one-in-a-million athlete . "
