Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi has long insisted his country had nothing to do with the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland , even after last year 's conviction of a Libyan intelligence agent for involvement in the attack . But according to a letter obtained by TIME , Gaddafi will make a " substantial formal offer " to compensate families of the 270 victims within a month . The April 23 letter to families was written by New York City attorney James P. Kreindler , who has been in Paris negotiating with senior Libyans behind closed doors . Kreindler 's missive does not predict how much money Gaddafi will put on the table . However , a number of estimates place the figure as high as $3.5 billion . <P> There is a catch , and it 's a big one . If Gaddafi pays compensation and also admits Libyan responsibility for the crime , he will expect in return a resumption of oil trade and other commerce currently prohibited by U.S. sanctions and , eventually , renewed diplomatic relations with Washington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recent CIA report says Libya is aggressively seeking weapons of mass destruction , notably chemical arms and ballistic-missile delivery systems . " The President has made absolutely clear that these weapons will not be tolerated , " a senior Bush Administration official tells TIME . " That means , very simply , that removing sanctions from a country like Libya , which is trying to obtain them , is not going to happen , no matter how much money Gaddafi is prepared to offer .
