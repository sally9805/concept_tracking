Improving Conservation in the Potato Field <p> The popularity of carbohydrates fluctuates with fickle diet trends . But even so , potatoes are never far from the nation 's table . An energizing source of complex carbohydrates , vitamins , and minerals , the potato is America 's favorite vegetable . We eat about 140 pounds per person each year , according to USDA 's Economic Research Service . To ensure that we do n't meet our demand for potatoes at the expense of the environment , ARS scientists are studying which potato management practices can improve soil conservation and groundwater quality . Going Under Cover <p> Heavily fertilized crops with shallow roots , such as potatoes  --  grown on irrigated , coarse-textured soils  --  are susceptible to nitrate leaching . But , says Jorge Delgado , a soil scientist at ARS 's Soil Plant Nutrient Research Unit in Fort Collins , Colorado , " nitrogen recovery can be significantly improved , and nitrate leaching minimized , by following a shallow-rooted crop with a deep-rooted cover crop , like winter rye , malting barley , or winter wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can reduce wind erosion and protect groundwater by recovering nitrate from soil and irrigation water . Deep-rooted cover crops sequester carbon , cycle nutrients , and draw nitrate from far down in the soil . Some covers , like winter rye and wheat , can even be used for grazing . <p> Delgado says that in a cooperative study with USDA 's Natural Resources Conservation Service ( NRCS ) , an early-planted winter rye cover crop increased subsequent tuber yield by an average of 1,500 pounds per acre . And in work with NRCS and Colorado State University , when potatoes followed a sorghum cover crop instead of fallow , total marketable yield increased 12 percent  --  and tubers were larger . The results show that farmers can generate income of $60 to $100 more per acre by using cover crops . Nitrogen Analysis and Precision Conservation <p> The researchers are also experimenting with cutting-edge technology . Using innovations like geographic information systems ( GIS ) , global positioning systems , modeling , and remote sensing , the Fort Collins scientists evaluate various farming practices to see which ones use nitrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservation and precision agriculture are referred to as " precision conservation . " The scientists " have developed several important tools to help gauge nitrogen management , like a new version of the Nitrogen Leaching and Environmental Analysis Package , a computer model which uses GIS technology , " says research leader Ronald Follett . <p> With precision-conservation techniques and GIS databases , scientists identify areas susceptible to nitrate leaching losses . " With proper timing and placement of nitrogen fertilizer and rotations that include deeper rooted , high-biomass-producing crops , we can increase nitrogen-use efficiency and conserve water quality , " Delgado says . Bring On the Brassicas <p> The Pacific Northwest accounts for more than half of America 's $3 billion potato crop , with Washington and Idaho as the nation 's top producers . Nitrate leaching and erosion also affect eastern Washington 's Columbia Basin , where soils are typically low in organic matter . Some potato growers replenish the soil 's organic matter and stave off erosion and nitrate losses by planting fall cover crops of mustard and other Brassica species . In Washington State alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown from 400 acres to more than 20,000 in a few years . <p> At the Vegetable and Forage Crops Production Research Unit in Prosser , Washington , microbiologist Hal Collins has been conducting field studies to determine how much nitrogen these cover crops release into soil as they decompose and their effects on microbe and nematode populations , especially those considered potato pests . As soil microbes break down plant material , they release nitrogen in the Brassica plants and make it available to the next crop . This process is known as " nitrogen mineralization . " <p> Collins combined his field-research expertise with the analytical know-how of Delgado 's group . Using isotopic nitrogen ( 15 N ) and a field plot , the scientists measured the amount of nitrogen contributed by mineralization of Brassica cover crops in the soil . The isotope allows them to track how much nitrogen is absorbed by the following potato crop from decomposition of the Brassica . <p> They found that 29 percent of the nitrogen once contained in the aboveground parts of the Brassica crop was recovered in the subsequent potato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertilization . " Collins and Delgado measured a green-fertilization effect equal to 27 to 39 pounds of nitrogen per acre that will be taken up by the potato crop . With 20,000 acres planted in Brassica cover crops , this effect increases nitrogen-use efficiency and decreases nitrogen losses across the region . Collins estimates that the cover crop could save growers $15 to $20 per acre at current fertilizer prices . <p> " The implication of this work will be to fine-tune nitrogen-management recommendations in a potato rotation system , including the cover crops , " says research leader Ashok Alva . Nitrogen Use Studies <p> In Maine , farmers have been planting and digging up potatoes for nearly 150 years , but ARS researchers say there 's plenty to learn about sustainable potato production  --  including nitrogen management . <p> " We 've known for a while that rotations are one way to add nutrients to the soil , " says ARS agronomist Tim Griffin , of the New England Plant , Soil , and Water Laboratory in Orono , Maine . " Crops that fix , or make , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soybeans  --  can start releasing organic nitrogen once they 're plowed under . " <p> Maine researchers are looking across the entire potato system for answers to nitrogen-use questions , like how do you know if more nitrogen is being released in the soil than a crop can use ? The scientists are studying obvious influences  --  soil organic matter content , crop sequences , disease presence , and water availability  --  as well as more subtle factors , like soil temperature . <p> Griffin says higher temperatures increase microbial activity , creating more available nitrogen for the crops . The researchers have modeled the influence of temperature on decomposition and nitrogen availability to predict the best time to apply additional fertilizer to meet the crop 's needs . " This means less nitrate will be lost to groundwater , " says research leader Wayne Honeycutt . <p> One of the toughest factors to account for is weather . In Maine , most potato farms rely on the fickle precipitation that nature provides .
