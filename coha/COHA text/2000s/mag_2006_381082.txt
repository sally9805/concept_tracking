Al Gore used to joke that it was easy to pick him out in a roomful of Secret Service agents : He was the stiff one . So he was the first to say how surreal it was to find himself the toast of Cannes last week . Over two days at the celebrated film festival , the former Vice President conducted what he figures were 48 interviews , many of them roundtable sessions , to accommodate the kind of interest that entertainment reporters usually bestow on people named Halle and Beyonc . And then there was that encounter with Hugh Jackman , the Australian heartthrob whose expected summer blockbuster , X-Men : The Last Stand , was set to open in some 16,000 theaters around the world . " It was just a random comment , and here 's how I remember it  --  Hugh Jackman saying , ' Well , I look forward to your movie , ' " Gore told TIME with a lusty chortle . " And I thought to myself , Oooo-kay . " <P> Then again , Gore 's new movie has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the tale of a scorned , washed-up politician transformed into a laptop-wielding ninja whose PowerPoint could rescue the planet from the forces of greed and indifference . The slide-show warning about the risks of global warming that Gore , 58 , has been giving to audiences for years has been turned into a 92-min. documentary called An Inconvenient Truth . The film opened in New York City and Los Angeles to better-than-decent reviews , expands to all the 10 biggest markets this week and will go nationwide by the Fourth of July weekend . Laurie David , wife of Seinfeld creator Larry David , is one of the producers ; it 's being distributed by Paramount . <P> Already there are spin-offs . A book with the same title has been published . The money Gore makes from the film will go toward a bipartisan media and grassroots education campaign whose participants include Brent Scowcroft , National Security Adviser to the first President Bush . Viewers of the film are directed to a website :                @ @ @ @ @
