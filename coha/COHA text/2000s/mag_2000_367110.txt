Every journalist has a novel in him , said Karl Kraus , and if he 's smart , he 'll keep it there . Countless potboilers by deadline drudges have proved the wisdom of Kraus ' pitiless warning . But with Primary Colors in 1996 , Joe Klein made himself an exception to the rule . Klein 's first novel managed to survive the gimmickry of its initial publication . It was released , as the world will recall , under the byline Anonymous , making Guess the Author a favorite parlor game along the Washington-Manhattan media axis . With its deft plotting , crackling dialogue and a raft of engaging characters , thinly veiled and drawn from real life , Primary Colors remains an essential document of the Clinton era . <P> It 's a hard act to follow . The Running Mate ( Dial Press ; 403 pages ; $26.95 ) is Klein 's game attempt to keep the momentum going , a sequel of sorts . Charlie Martin , the new novel 's hero , appeared briefly in the earlier book as a presidential candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press as a hippie Vietnam Vet . Many characters from Colors do brief walk-ons in the new book , much as the star of a popular sitcom may help launch a spin-off . On TV , of course , spin-offs usually fail . <P> The Running Mate is by no means a failure , but it lacks the sharp sting of reality that made Primary Colors a success . At the center of Colors was Jack Stanton  --  a faux Bill Clinton as mesmerizing , repellent , glib , eloquent ( take your pick ) as the real thing . Charlie Martin ca n't carry that kind of weight . Decent , well-meaning , pragmatic , Charlie returns to his home state after his crash-and-burn presidential bid to run for a third Senate term . But he succumbs to unexpected distractions  --  including a romance with a glamorous Manhattan designer and the appearance of a previously unknown ( surprise , Charlie ! ) illegitimate son . The most unexpected distraction of all : a tough re-election opponent named Lee Butler . Butler is the book 's weakest link  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's day job ) . Butler launches his campaign with a series of Bible-study meetings , and he gets more Ralph Reedy from there . And you 'll never guess : it turns out he 's a hypocrite ! In some literary precincts , apparently , this will be thought a clever twist . <P> But for the most part , Klein sustains the mastery of storytelling mechanics that he demonstrated in Colors . The plot accelerates to a fitting climax , goosed along by enough offhand apercus and knowing set pieces to satisfy any reader interested in The Way We Politick Now . If this reporter has more novels inside him , let them come . <P>  --  By Andrew Ferguson
