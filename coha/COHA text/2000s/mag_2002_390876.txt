// The wagon stopped at the foot of the gleaming white tower , and two faces gazed out at the vast lake . The gentle waves lapped the shore , and the pines whispered a welcome . " Here we are , Sarah-the North Winds Lighthouse . Our new home . " That evening , Sarah and Papa took a break from unpacking . He led her up a narrow , winding staircase to a tiny room that was made entirely of windows . Pressing her hands against the glass , Sarah strained to see across the lake . She counted at least twenty fishing boats , but she could not see the other side of the lake . In the center of the room , Sarah saw the huge lens , which looked like a glass beehive and was almost as tall as she was . Papa reached inside and filled a small lamp with kerosene . " You must never , never touch the lamp , " he warned . " But you can help me . Since the lamp must be lit exactly at sunset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sarah watched the sun slowly sink into the lake , spreading a path of fire across the water . When she could no longer see even the tiniest glimmer of gold , she whirled around . " Now ! " she said . Papa touched a match to the wick , and Sarah gasped as the room burst into brilliance . The tiny light grew enormous as it passed through the magnifying lens and out the windows , far over the darkening waters . Photograph // Sarah thought Papa had the most important job in the world . Every day that summer , she shined the brass buttons on his uniform . Every evening , she followed him to the lantern room , keeping a careful eye on the sun and giving the signal at just the right moment . And every night , Papa watched the light until morning to make sure it never went out . The days grew shorter as autumn drew near , and Sarah shivered in the evenings . One morning , she awoke to a gray , cloudy sky . The chilly air whipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa paced the bluff all day , his eyes fixed on the fishing boats that were strung along the horizon like beads on a string . Sarah brought him a mug of steaming coffee . " Why do n't you come inside and get warm , Papa ? " she asked . " I do n't like this weather , " Papa answered . " I 'll rest after the boats are in . " The wind blew the waves into choppy whitecaps as the afternoon faded into dusk . Tiny drops of rain glistened on Sarah 's forehead . The fishing boats headed one by one for the harbor as the waves grew higher . Suddenly , Papa gave a sharp cry . He ran to the foot of the tower and began untying the knots of the lifeboat ropes as fast as he could . Thunder rumbled in the distance . Sarah ran after him . " What 's the matter , Papa ? " " One of the fishermen is in trouble ! " Papa answered , wrenching the last knot free . " But , Papa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah shouted against the wind . " It 's going to storm ! " " I 'll be all right , Sarah . Wait for me inside ! " He heaved the lifeboat into the waves and began rowing out into the lake . Photograph // Terrified , Sarah raced up the lighthouse stairs , reaching the top just as the first bolt of lightning pierced the water . Through her spyglass , she could see water in the bottom of the fisherman 's boat . Papa had almost made it to him , but the waves were pushing the two boats apart . Sarah felt terribly small and alone , and her heart quaked with fear . The storm bore down with a violent fury . Huge waves crashed over the rocks below , but the sky was growing so dark that soon Sarah could hardly see them . With a start , she realized that the sun was going down behind the thunderclouds . Papa was not home to light the lamp ! Nervously , she glanced at the box of matches . Papa had said never , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all now . Where was Papa ? What if his lifeboat capsized ? What if he could not swim to shore ? What if he could not see to find his way home ? Quickly , Sarah grabbed the matches . With a shaking hand , she struck one and touched it to the wick . As the white beam burst out into the storm , Sarah sank into a chair , trembling . Tears welled up in her eyes , but she blinked them away . I have to keep it burning all night , she thought to herself . Late that night , the storm began to blow itself out . The thunder quieted , the lightning passed , and the rain stopped . Sarah sat quietly , waiting . Papa was out there somewhere . Photograph // She meant to stay awake all night , but she jerked her head up and realized that the first rays of sunlight were darting from the horizon . The light was still burning . Sarah jumped out of her chair and peered hopefully out the windows , but Papa was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and made her way down to the beach . The sky was clear and bright . Sarah could hardly believe there had been a storm at allbut Papa was gone . She climbed to the top of the bluff where Papa had kept watch over the fishing boats . The gulls circled overhead , searching the washed-up seaweed and driftwood for dead fish . A sudden movement in the distance caught her attention , and her sleepy eyes grew wide as she spotted a figure moving her way . " Papa ! " Sarah screamed joyfully as she ran toward the beach . Papa caught her in his arms and hugged her tight . Sarah saw that he was exhausted , but the buttons on his uniform were as bright as ever . " Sarah , " he said . " Thank heavens , you 're all right . " " Oh , Papa , " she said . " I was so scared . I did n't know what to do ! I lit the lamp , Papa . I thought you might not find your way home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did , Sarah . I 've been following it all night . " " Did you rescue the fisherman ? " " Yes . The storm blew us a long way down the coast , but we finally made it to shore . " He brushed away her tears and felt her shiver from the cold . " I had n't realized how much you 'd grown up this summer , Sarah . " He draped the jacket around her shoulders . " I could n't ask for a finer assistant lightkeeper . " Sarah 's heart swelled with pride as she pulled the jacket around her tight . <p>
