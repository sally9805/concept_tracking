<p> ALBUQUERQUE  --  New Mexico 's largest metropolis has an identity problem . <p> Just 60 miles to the north , the capital city of Santa Fe  --  style icon and darling of the chic set  --  hogs the limelight like an adored older sister who has cuter clothes and more friends . In contrast , Albuquerque seems ungainly , even a bit dowdy . Indeed , many out-of-towners experience little of the city beyond its airport , where they fly in , rent a car and make a beeline north . <p> It 's enough to give a place an inferiority complex . <p> But now , on the eve of its 300th birthday , Albuquerque is doing some soul searching and taking stock of its tourism potential . A new destination master plan positions the city as a cultural and heritage hot spot where Native American and Hispanic cultures once collided and now coexist . <p> In fact , declares Bob Harvey , the consultant who prepared the plan , what Cairo is to the Egyptian pyramids and Lima , Peru , is to the Incan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you want to see the Pueblo cultures and the relationships with the Spanish encounters , you do it from Albuquerque , " he says . The state 's 19 Indian pueblos ( communities whose land is owned and occupied by New Mexican tribes ) are within a 2 1/2-hour drive of the city , along with Chaco Canyon , the Holy Grail of Pueblo archaeological sites . <p> " Everybody knows Santa Fe . But Albuquerque ? " says Indian Pueblo Cultural Center president Ron Solimon , recalling a recent European trade show he attended . " I try to explain we have culture , heritage , landscape . " <p> The center , operated by the 19 pueblos , offers an excellent orientation for those venturing to the surrounding Native American villages . But there are a growing number of reasons to linger in the city proper . <p> Its compact downtown is undergoing a major revitalization . Former schools , banks and other vintage buildings have been recast as urban lofts , infusing life into a once-moribund area . Along Central Avenue , part of historic Route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deco-style KiMo Theatre have injected vitality after dark . <p> Two miles west in Old Town , where settlement first took root in 1706 , the Albuquerque Museum of Art &; History last year added a spacious new wing for traveling exhibits . South of downtown , the 5-year-old National Hispanic Cultural Center just opened a fine show featuring work by mostly Mexican artists including Frida Kahlo , Diego Rivera and Rufino Tamayo . A few miles east of downtown , where Central Avenue climbs past the University of New Mexico to the Nob Hill neighborhood , buildings from Route 66 's heyday now house one-of-a-kind shops and restaurants . <p> In the city 's northern reaches , a hot air balloon museum opened last fall in Balloon Fiesta Park , site of the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta every October . <p> But it 's Albuquerque 's ditches that appeal to longtime resident and best-selling author Tony Hillerman . The network of irrigation canals dates to the original Spanish settlement . Walking paths shaded by soaring cottonwood trees border many of them and some retain names of families who possessed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established , affluent neighborhood that borders the east bank of the Rio Grande , and he 's a fixture along the maze of ditches . " What I find appealing about living in Albuquerque are the public places to walk and have isolation and privacy , " he says . <p> He moved here in 1961 from Santa Fe and has n't regretted it . <p> " Albuquerque is n't a notable place . You never see it on the national news except for crimes and misdemeanors . But a heck of a lot of us live here because we like the mountains and irrigation ditches . " <p> Others , including members of a growing arts community , are drawn by the city 's relatively low cost of living . Inside a 45-foot tower at the entrance to the National Hispanic Cultural Center , Frederico Vigil pauses in his work creating frescoes depicting the breadth of Hispanic history . In 2002 , he relocated to Albuquerque from a studio on Canyon Road , the epicenter of the Santa Fe art scene . <p> " I sense a dynamic feeling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here are professionals and emerging artists who because of the diversity and stimulation are moving in . Plus , you can still buy a burrito for $2 . " <p> Vigil 's current mission is to complete a painstaking process of monolithic proportion in El Torreon ( the tower ) frescoes . As he puts it , he has " 4,000-plus square feet of wall space to depict 500 years of Hispanic movement and genetic mutation . " He has been working on it since 2002 and figures the project is three years from completion . <p> The tower is destined to serve as a contemplative space before visitors enter the sprawling 30-acre complex that , besides the art gallery , houses three theaters and a genealogical library . When it is finished , it 's likely to be a top visitor draw in a city that center director Eduardo Diaz believes is just beginning to grasp the value of cultural and heritage tourism . <p> " The city does n't need to reinvent any wheels . There 's plenty to do here , " says Diaz , who previously headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a matter of capturing visitors ' imagination and creating a sense of surprise so you get this wow effect and the guy who 's here for the dermatology convention says , ' I 'm coming back . ' " <p> One of the impediments to that is the fact that , unlike Santa Fe , whose tourist center is relatively compact , Albuquerque 's attractions are widely dispersed . A ride up the 2.7-mile Sandia Peak Tramway , which claims fame as the world 's longest aerial tramway , gives visitors standing atop the 10,400-foot peak a sense of just how vast Albuquerque 's environs are . From the west-facing rugged granite girth of the mountain , the view takes in 11,000 square miles . <p> On the western edge of town across the Rio Grande , Petroglyph National Monument harbors ample proof  --  20,000 or so petrogylphs carved into basalt rock  --  that this region was a busy crossroads long before the Spanish arrival in 1540 . Historians say there were 47 riverside native villages in the Rio Grande Valley at the time , ancestors of current Pueblo residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclaiming Albuquerque " the city of small surprises . " And indeed there is a plethora of only-in-Albuquerque sights . A 60-foot-tall Redstone missile rises outside the National Atomic Museum , where the gift shop sells atomic bomb earrings ( in a choice of Fat Man or Little Boy ) in sterling silver . <p> In the Barelas neighborhood south of downtown , pharmacist Tom Sanchez , 82 , dispenses dried herbs for the body and religious paraphernalia for the soul at B. Ruppe Drugs , a locked-in-a-time-warp establishment with its own votive-lighted altar . <p> Behind the 213-year-old San Felipe church in Old Town , Art Romero approaches a walking-tour group and declares , " There are bodies and guns and cannons buried under this parking lot . " Guide Debbie Ridley gives the floor to Romero , who points out a rendering of the Virgin of Guadalupe carved into the hollow trunk of a 300-year-old cottonwood tree . <p> Continuing through Old Town , Ridley leads the group through 300-plus years of history , from Coronado 's arrival in the region in 1540 to the 1706 establishment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shady band-shell-crowned green space , is dominated by the twin-spired San Felipe church and an assortment of 18th- and 19th-century buildings , most of which now house restaurants and shops catering to tourists . <p> " Albuquerque is a collection of small gems , more than a big city , " says Ridley , a 20-year resident . " You just have to dig a little to find them . " If you go ... Albuquerque 's 300th blowout birthday bash is April 21-23 , but related events continue throughout the year .

" the question relates to chile and the cuisine is New Mexican . Two no-frills favorites : Barelas Coffee House , where the heaping carne adovada plate with sides is a mere $6.35 . The Frontier in the Nob Hill neighborhood is a local institution that fills a city block and never closes ; entrees top out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Standard Diner on Central ( entrees , $7.95-$22.95 ) or the Slate Street Cafe downtown ( entrees $9-$15 ) . <p> Do n't miss : Petroglyph National Monument ( 505-899-0205 ; nps.gov/petr ) ; the ride up Sandia Peak Tramway ( $15 adults ; 505-856-7325 ; sandiapeak.com ) ; exhibits at the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center ( 505-843-7270 ; indianpueblo.org ) . <p> Information : 800-284-2282 ; itsatrip.org . <p> Hillerman 's Albuquerque Best-selling author Tony Hillerman 's evocative mysteries set on the Navajo Reservation have given legions of fans a sense of life in Indian country . But the writer , whose latest book , The Shape Shifter , is due in November , also knows a lot about Albuquerque , where he 's lived since 1961 . Among his favorite spots : <p> Where he takes out of towners : " We 've got a dandy natural history museum ( the New Mexico Museum of History and Science ) . Or the ( Sandia Peak ) tramway . You can see the world from 11,000 feet , and there 's a good restaurant up there .
