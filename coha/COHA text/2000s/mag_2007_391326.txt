Headnote This intense but doable workout will sculpt you from head to toe-without any grunting , yelling , or marching . Years ago the only people who got to " savor " the boot-camp experience were new military recruits . Today it 's gone mainstream , thanks to the constant demand for more challenging and diverse exercise classes and the fact that the high-intensity approach gets results fast . I 've been leading these hard-charging sessions-which burn hundreds of calories , strengthen your entire body , and improve your fitness level-for the past 15 years . This month I 've put together a plan for boot-camp novices ( just turn the page ) , because beginners are often intimidated by such vigorous workouts . My routine is adaptable for all levels , though . Just increase the difficulty as you get stronger and you 'll see your body getting leaner and firmer .

You can also perform these moves inside if you have to , but you 'll have to find another way to do the jogging sprints at the end . Try running in place , sprinting on a treadmill , or jumping rope . * Know your body If you can do the moves back-to-back without resting , that 's great . If you cant quite keep up the intensity , try waiting 30 to 60 seconds between each exercise . Keep the break as short as you can , however , to ensure that your workout effort stays high . This is supposed to be challenging-but you do n't want to injure yourself either . * Modify as necessary Each of these moves can be made even easier by reducing the depth of your squat or lunge , doing It without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Change up your tools These exercises call for dumbbells , but you can also grab a weighted ball , ankle and wrist weights , bottles filled with sand or water-or nothing at all ! * Pack your boot-camp bag if you do head to the beach or park to try this routine , go prepared . Bring plenty of water , a towel ( you will sweat ) , your weights , a post-workout snack like the one below , sunscreen , and your M player , loaded with high-energy songs .
