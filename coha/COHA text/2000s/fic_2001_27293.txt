I once read that in some primitive tribe or other , they punished people by ignoring them . If you were being punished , nobody would talk to you . Theyd look through you , theyd pretend you did nt exist . It wouldnt take long for this treatment to kill you . I mean , youd actually die . Dead . I did nt die , but for the first nine months of eighth grade I almost wished I had . Before then , I had not one but two best friends , Tracy and Freda . Wed been friends since kindergarten . But then Tracy moved to Connecticut , and Fredas parents got mad at Claverford . They said the teachers werent developmentally aware enough.They sent Freda to a boarding school even though we had only one more year to go before high school . At first I wasnt worried . I figured Id make more friends at school . But it turned out making new friends wasnt easyor even possible . Cliques had already been established , and I couldnt break in . Or maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was okay . Fun . Nice , even . At first , the other kids werent out-and-out mean . They let me sit with them at lunchbut nobody talked to me . If I had to call somebody about homework , whoever it was would answer my questionsthe same way you take messages for your parentsbored , but vaguely polite . Then , in November , it got worse . Much worse . Ms. Hannah , my teacher for homeroom and language arts , told us to write two pages on our " secret lives . " " This is the creative in creative writing , children . " Ms. Hannah was the only teacher who still called us " children . " She also pronounced " blue " as b-l-y-e-w . I wrote seven pages pretending to be my Airedale , Reggie . I could have written a hundred pages . I love animals , I love dogs , and I especially love Reggie . I wrote about dog happiness , about what dog dreams were like , about how it felt to chase a squirrel , about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the German shepherd who lived across the hall . But thats not what got me in trouble when Ms. Hannah read my report out loud . She started out by saying she wanted us to hear the best example of " point of view " shed ever come across in a students writing . I relaxed in my chair , waiting to hear yet another piece by Daphne , who was adored by Ms. Hannah and avoided by everyone on our side of the teachers desk . " Wilma is to be congratulated on her exemplary effort , which you shall now hear . " I wished I could vaporize and reassemble in a middle school in Moscow . If I had thought anyone else would hear my paper , I would have written the kind of thing everybody else wrote , like my secret life as a music video star , or my secret life as a pro basketball player . The awful part began halfway down the first page , when Ms. Hannah read , " I hear the elevator door open . It is my beloved Wilma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My beloved Wilma is asleep . From the foot of the bed , I watch her . She is so beautiful . " Everybody was laughing so hard that Ms. Hannah had to wait five minutes before she could continue . Was she going to read all seven pages ? I could survive what shed read so far , but not if she kept going . She kept going . " I see Celeste , the dalmatian who is my best friend after my beloved Wilma . She is peeing . I rush to smell her pee . Celeste had chicken for dinner . I lift my leg over her pee . " The class howled . Timothy stamped his feet . BeeBee moaned that she had to pee . They all looked at me and looked away again laughing harder than ever . It took Ms. Hannah five more minutes to get them to quiet down . I wished they never would . I knew what came next . " Then I sniff her anus . It smells rich and full of Celeste . " After that , Ms. Hannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody talked to me , except for the occasional woof or snuffling noise as I walked through the hallsand that wasnt conversation . I was left strictly alone , with only three exceptions . The first exception was Jared , who sat next to me in language arts . He told me he liked my secret life . He said it made him understand dogs better than he had before . I was glad to hear it , but I wasnt interested in Jared Fein , whose eyebrows met over his nose , forming one long continuous eyebrow . The second exception was Ardis Lundy , the most popular girl at Claverford . She had Ms. Hannah for sixth period , and Ms. Hannah had been kind enough to read my secret life there , too . " Im glad she did nt read mine , " Ardis told me . " I pretended I was my grandmother , raising my mother . It was pretty personal . " And she smiled at me . After that , shed smile and wave when she saw me , but then again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Suzanne Russo . Razor Mouth Suzanne Russo . From then on shed call me " beloved Wilma , " or ask me what Id sniffed lately or if there were any good fire hydrants near school . And no matter what else she said , shed always drag the word " anus " in somehow . Then , two weeks after The Reading , I got a lucky break . Mr. Pashkin , our communications teacher , paired everyone off for debates , and he paired me with BeeBee Molzen , who was very popular . Our topic was human cloning , and we were supposed to work together on our arguments before we debated in front of everybody . I thought this could be my chance to make a new friend , and then to make even more friends if BeeBee brought me into her clique . That afternoon BeeBee and I met after school at the public library . And we had fun . I told her I did nt like public speaking , and she said she always lost debates , even with her little brother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hear , and she predicted shed just say , " Duh , uh , clone , uh , duh . " I took the side that cloning humans was ethical , and BeeBee took the opposite side . I helped her look up arguments against me , and she gave me tips to get rid of stage fright . Then we agreed to meet again at the library the next day to practice and do more research . I thought we had made progress in becoming friends . I had nt made an idiot of myself ; Id even made her laugh a few times . But when I asked her if she wanted to walk over together , she said she couldnt . She said shed meet me there because she had to talk to her friends first . I knew I had a way to go . The next day , after we finished preparing for the debate , we talked about what it would be like to have clones of ourselves . BeeBee , who liked to paint , said she wouldnt need a mirror to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gang up on my older sister , Maud . " And if there were a clone of me , " I added , " shed be younger , and Id have a little sister . " " I wish I had a little sister too , " BeeBee said . " But they wouldnt clone a dope like me . " " They wouldnt clone me either , " I said . ( Secretly I thought they might , though , after I made history in veterinary medicine . ) And then BeeBee said sure theyd clone me , and I said she wasnt a dope , and I really thought we had taken a few steps toward being friends . The day after that , the seat next to her at lunch was empty . I gathered my courage and said , " Can I sit here ? " I could swear the whole cafeteria fell silent at just that second . BeeBee never looked up and never said anything . Evadney Jones , president of SGO , our student government organization , said they were holding the chair for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned away , I heard giggles . And that was that . Except I did extra research for our debate and worked out more arguments on my side . And when we debated , I did nt just win , I demolished BeeBee . I made her look stupid . And afterward I felt only the tiniest bit bad for her . Hardly bad at all . I stopped trying to make friends after that . I just went through the day trying to ignore everyone , except they ignored me first , and better . I solved the problem of where to sit at lunch by bringing sandwiches from home . I ate them in the girls bathroom on the fourth floor , as far away from the cafeteria as possible . It was a disgusting place to eat , but in the bathroom I did nt feel so alone because I wasnt in the middle of everybody else having people to talk to . There were other loners at school , of courseDaphne , Jared , a kid named Benjy , and a few more . Youd think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe , or she could have made friends with me . But it did nt work that way . She did nt try to be my friend and I did nt try to be hers . I saw the other loners the way everyone else didas unappealing , as to be avoided at all costs . If I hung out with one of them , I thought , my unpopular status would get worse , not better , because it would be magnified by association . I thought Id lose any chance of changing things . Not admirable , I guessbut true . Probably true for Daphne . Definitely true for me . Anyway , day after day , I became so used to swallowing around a lump in my throat that when I caught strep throat in February , I did nt realize I was sick . I just thought the lump had gotten bigger . Mom noticed I was sick , though , and I had to stay home for two wonderful weeks . I had a high fever , and it felt like a knife was stuck in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two After my strep throat , I wanted to get the flu , mono , a broken leganything that wasnt terminal or disfiguring . But I stayed healthy . When I went back to school , nothing changed . And nothing had changed three months later when I met the old lady on the subway . I did nt expect her to make any difference either , and she did nt . On the subway stairs I was surrounded by laughing , yelling kids , but I was alone . The usual . Outside , it had just stopped raining , and the breeze was chilly . I was cold , even though it was May twenty-sixth . The old lady must have guessed about my wanting to be popular , I reasoned . Most kids want that . Though how she knew my name was a mystery . Nobody names a kid Wilma . The last person before me to be named Wilma was prehistorica Flintstone . Maybe I look like a Wilma . My neck is short , and my front teeth are long , like a beaver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes add to the beaver look . A friendly beaver , thats me . At the corner of West Twenty-fourth and Tenth , I saw Ardis half a block behind me with a few billion of her friends . Even though she had talked to me on the " beloved Wilma " day , she hardly knew me . Claverford is small enough for everybody to know everybody , but I knew her better than she knew me . Its like you know things about the President of the United States , but heor shedoesnt know you from a lima bean . Ordinarily , I would have kept on walking . But this morning , because I was cold , and tired of being invisible and alone , and because of the old lady , I decided to talk to Ardis . I waited at the curb for her . One of the bunch with Ardis was Razor Mouth Suzanne . Suzanne had always clung by her fingernails to the popular clique . She lived in the same building as me , and Id known her since we were five , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tiny and perfect and had a teeny voice that carried a million miles . She reminded me of a Pomeranianfox face and needle-sharp bark , and nervous , darting brown eyes . Ardis , on the other hand , was tall and big boned and regal . She was African American , with the shaggy hair of an Irish water spaniel . Her nose was hawkish , but her eyes were huge and an amazing blue-gray , and her mouth was made for lipstick ads . The group was getting closer . What could I say to Ardis ? I thought of possible topics of conversation . She was on the track team and in the debating club . In the fall , shed been elected to SGO , but Id once overheard Suzanne telling somebody that Ardis was failing half her subjects and might get kicked out . " Hi , Ardis , " I said . " Wilmabeloved ! " Suzanne yelped . Somebody giggled . I heard a low " woof . " Suzanne went on . " Sniffed any yummy " Ardis interrupted her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was so nice . " Hi , " I said . " Howre you doing ? " It wasnt really a question , and she did nt wait for an answer . She started to cross the street with her friends . But I pretended she did want to know . " Im okay , " I said . So far , so good . Now what else could I say ? I stood on the curb , thinking . If she was failing half her subjects , maybe I could say something to help . I called after her , " If you want , I could help you out in science and history . " My best subjects . She turned and yelled at me while walking backward across the street . She wasnt smiling anymore . " Who says I need help ? The last thing I need is " A truck drove between us and drowned her out . It was near my side of the street , and it plowed through a puddle , drenching me from my waist to my feet . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the block . I was soaked and cold and dirty . That was so dumb of me , to remind Ardis of her bad grades . How could I possibly have thought it would make her like me ? And now Id given Suzanne something new to laugh at me about . Some help the old lady had been . If she had nt tottered into my life , I wouldnt have waited for Ardis . And if I had nt waited , Id be dry and unpopular right now , which would be an improvement . I stood there , hating to show up at school looking this way . Theres Wilma . She splashed through a puddle to chase a stick . Theres Wilma . Another dog peed on her . Theres Wilma . Gross . I started squelching to school . At least I did nt have far to go . Claverford was straight ahead , on the northeast corner of Eleventh Avenue and Twenty-fourth Street . It stood out on a block of shoe-box factory buildings because of its zany architecture , which it was famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a goofy giant playing with blocks . The small blocks were classrooms . The big ones were the auditorium , the cafeteria , and the library . It was also famous for being the richest middle school in the country . If you went there , either you were smart and had a scholarship , or your parents were loaded . In spite of our ugly uniforms , which were supposed to make it impossible to tell , everybody knew who was a Brain and who was a Wallet . Suzanne and I were Brains , although in her case I think they made a mistake . Ardis was a smart Wallet . You couldnt be a dope and survive in the debating club . Some of the most popular kids were Brains and some were Wallets . Money did nt matter . Beauty did nt either . For example , everybody liked BeeBee , my debate opponent , even though she had no chin and almost no forehead . And her boyfriend was Carlos the Adorable , the same Carlos Id had a crush on for the last two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the schools tall wooden doors . Two girls jostled me , and neither one apologized . A four-hundred-pound hiking boot squashed my foot . We werent supposed to wear hiking boots to school . I limped under the overhang and took a few steps into the building . Ardis and some of her friends stood under the clock in the lobby . " Hey , Wilma . " She waved and moved toward me , and her group moved with her . " Youre wet . " She smiled at me . " A bus splashed me last week . It was terrible . I was soaked and muddy for hours . " " Wilma . . . " Suzanne began . She was going to ask if a hydrant had opened on me . Or something nastier . " . . . I never noticed your eyelashes before . Theyre gorgeous . " Suzanne looked around at everybody . " Are nt they ? " They all nodded and looked friendly . Huh ?                 @ @ @ @
