Section : Finale Breaking the hearts of Average Joes everywhere , Melana Scantlin chooses hunky Jason Peoples <p> A few hours after Melana Scantlin chose student Jason Peoples over wealthy stock trader Adam Mesh , she and Peoples were spirited away to Baja California . There , the couple match-made on NBC 's Average Joe spent five idyllic days in a coastal house , enjoying the views , a nearby lagoon and , of course , each other . " We 'd sit in the master bathroom , in our tennis shoes and our sweatshirts , because the house was really cold , and talk for hours , " says Scantlin . Talking was pretty much the extent of it , though : Attended by chaperones , she got the bedroom and he slept on a couch downstairs . " It takes time for couples to get to that comfort level , but we did n't really need that time , " she says . " It felt like we 'd been together for five years . " <p> But then they were separated for seven months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 26 , and Peoples , 27 , only two brief visits before the Dec. 8 airing of the show 's finale . To continue the romance , they spoke weekly by phone  --  but gave each other carte blanche to date others . " It 's been difficult , " Peoples says of their time apart . " So I 've certainly been dating . Nothing serious . " Scantlin , who also saw other people , explains , " It kind of builds a trust and a confidence . " <p> Reunited , Scantlin seems giddy around Peoples  --  and comfortable enough to reveal herself as an obsessive groomer . " I plucked his eyebrows , " she confesses . Says Peoples : " She 's all , ' I can just clean that up for you . ' I 'm like , ' I do n't want it to look all feminine . ' She 's like , ' No , it 'll be fine , ' and she basically pinned me down . " After asking Peoples on the show if he was bisexual , Scantlin says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't gay , because he did n't pluck his eyebrows . " <p> Despite the easy intimacy , the final choice was n't easy for Scantlin . " Jason is an average Joe , " she says . " His looks are going to fade . My looks are going to fade . " Moreover , those chiseled looks , which were expected to give Peoples an edge , did not impress the ex-beauty queen initially . " He 's not even my type , " she says . " I usually go for taller guys , like Adam . " But on their first TV date , after Peoples proved to be a sympathetic listener at the end of a particularly grueling day , they locked lips  --  and everything changed . " It was n't even like a physical attraction , " says Scantlin . " It was just ' This is it . ' " <p> Even so , she says , on the morning of the last elimination round , " I woke up and did n't know what I was going to do . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came to the show 's 17.4 million viewers . " I was thrown into a damned-if-you-do , damned-if-you-do n't situation . No matter who I picked , it was either ' She 's a gold digger ' or ' She 's shallow for picking the guy who 's better-looking . ' " In the end , she says , " I picked who I had the best connection and chemistry with . I went with my heart . " <p> The choice surprised many in the Joe entourage . " I got no sense of what Jason 's like , " says Kathy Griffin , the show 's host . " I think basing a relationship on looks is about the stupidest thing I 've ever heard of . " At an L.A. pub , where six rejected Average Joes gathered with friends to watch the finale , Scantlin 's decision provoked cries of " She picked the wrong guy ! " The runner-up bears no hard feelings . " Jason is a good guy , " says Mesh , 28 , who watched the finale at a Manhattan bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scantlin 's decision , he says , " I really think it was n't about looks or personality . I think it took a lot for her to pick the person she liked the best . " <p> Now that Scantlin and Peoples are free to see each other , " We 're going to see , privately , where our relationship goes from here , " says Peoples . Logistics could prove a challenge . As a halftime emcee for the Kansas City Chiefs , Scantlin leads a peripatetic life . Peoples continues to work as a waiter in Irvine , Calif . ( " I have to pay my rent , " he says ) , and aims to complete a business and marketing degree at California State University , Long Beach . " Melana always wants to talk about it . ' What do you want to do ? How can we get you there ? ' " he says . " She 's what I need , a kick in the butt . " Wherever Peoples 's studies may lead , Scantlin says she 's certain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're together . " <p> Starting Over <p> As Melana Scantlin gazed into his eyes and cooed , " We developed a friendship , and that friendship developed into a romance , " Adam Mesh was certain he 'd won . When she continued , " Tonight the romance has to end , " says Mesh , " I thought she was kidding , like it was a test to see how I would react . " Once the truth sank in , " You 're almost relieved , " he says . " The waiting is over . " Since then , the burly runner-up has moved on . He 's hired a personal trainer , begun a diet and started using Propecia to combat hair loss . Oh yeah , one more thing . " I 'm dating someone now , " he says . " We started dating in September . I was walking out of my apartment building , she was moving in . Her name 's Jessica . " ( Yup , that 's the 22-year-old , who works in the financial industry , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) So much for post-Melana melancholy . <p> The Other Joes : Still Looking for Love JOHN BAUMGAERTNER , 27 <p> An acting career now seems one step closer .
