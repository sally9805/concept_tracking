With its elegant mingling of analog hands and digital functions , BMW 's new M watch ( available at dealerships for $275 ) looks as if it came straight out of a James Bond film . It 's packed with 256 megabytes of internal flash memory , which means you can store more than four hours of high-fidelity music , record voice memos and use it as a mini  --  hard drive for transporting computer files as well . The internal lithium-ion battery automatically recharges itself whenever you connect the watch to a PC ( via a removable USB plug ) . The major flaw : listening to music means you have to walk around with headphones connected to your wrist . We ca n't wait for wireless earbuds.  --  By Wilson Rothman
