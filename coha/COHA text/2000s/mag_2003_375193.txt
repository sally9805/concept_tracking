Announcing their 2003-04 schedules in New York City last week , TV executives said that next fall they will not resort to cheap reality stunts in midseason . All six broadcast networks will rise on the strength of a slew of creative new hits . And a special attachment will allow you to print $20 bills from your cable box . <P> O.K. , I made up the last sentence to make the paragraph more believable . Everyone expects a little overpromising at the annual " upfronts , " the expensive stage shows at which networks show trailers from their fall debuts and literally put on a song-and-dance for advertisers . At Carnegie Hall , CBS hired the Broadway cast of Chicago to disparage the competition to the tune of All That Jazz : " ABC is out of gas/while NBC eats horse 's a " ( a reference to the horse-rectum-eating challenge on Fear Factor ) . They 're called upfronts because they 're designed to entice advertisers to pay billions up front for next season 's ads , and the deals are lubricated by cocktails and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock market , in which the moneymen hope to invest in hits-to-be on their way up . <P> But as on Wall Street , you may think you 're buying a blue chip and end up holding WorldCom . That 's how some advertisers felt last year when they bought traditional dramas and sitcoms and , come winter , saw them replaced by the likes of Are You Hot ? Despite hits like Joe Millionaire , reality shows ' ratings are unpredictable , and not everyone wants their snack chips associated with Lorenzo Lamas ' laser pointer . <P> So last week the network chiefs , like guilty spouses , denounced reality TV as a cheap tart even as the scent of its perfume still clung to their collars . And they pledged their renewed fidelity  --  We mean it this time , honey !  --  to " original , quality scripted entertainment . " <P> " Scripted , " yes : the new schedules are heavy on old-fashioned sitcoms and dramas written by writers  --  but , then again , so were last fall 's . " Quality " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clip reels to the press at upfronts , so it 's as if the Cannes Film Festival consisted entirely of movie trailers . But " original " ? There 's the first belly laugh of the new season . CBS had the two biggest new dramas last year with CSI : Miami and Without a Trace ; so it announced three more crime dramas , plus two other dramas with cops as major characters . The WB , which hit big with a young , hot Superman on Smallville , offers a young , hot King of the Apes in Tarzan and Jane ( on which Jane , of course , is a cop ) . There are yet more star-vehicle sitcoms , for the likes of Whoopi Goldberg , Charlie Sheen and Kelly Ripa . And NBC , under pressure to replace Friends after its final season next year , unveiled Coupling , a risque sitcom about six sexy young men and women in a big city . A Friends copy , you say ? Nah . It 's a remake of a British sitcom  --  which was a Friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
