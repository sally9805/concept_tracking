Section : Enterprise Leaders Women are succeeding in British business , but , aye , here 's the rub : they 're Americans <p> If a spate of recent headlines is any indication , there 's never been a better time to be a businesswoman in Britain . In the past few months Barbara Cassani , the former CEO of Go Airlines , was appointed to head London 's 2012 Olympics bid and sit on the board of Britain 's largest retailer of food and clothing , Marks &; Spencer . Shell CFO Judith Boynton was promoted to the board of her company , and Laura Tyson made waves as head of the London Business School . Pearson CEO Marjorie Scardino led a prominent magazine 's list of the most powerful women executives outside the United States , and others , like Morgan Stanley Europe vice chair Amelia Fawcett and Burberry CEO Rose Marie Bravo , also made the cut . <p> There 's just one problem with all these British achievers  --  they 're all Americans . According to a recent study by Britain 's Cranfield School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boards of companies on the FTSE 100 , an index of the largest British companies , are from overseas . ( Though no comparable figure exists for men , experts estimate it 's much lower . ) The majority of those women are American . As one well-known British headhunter puts it , " If you want to sit on a board in Britain , you 'd better be American  --  or have a title . " <p> Historically , American women have always done well in Britain . The country 's first female M.P . was Nancy Astor , a spunky Virginian who came to the old country , married well , and as an outsider was perhaps better poised than her British sisters to break the rules of political convention and still be accepted . Likewise , many American executive women in Britain today say that not being British gives them an excuse to skirt London 's stifling business etiquette . " You can get away with a lot more , especially if you use the stereotypes to your advantage , " says Allyson Stewart-Allen , an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussing a potential project , I can say to clients very early on , ' I know it 's so American of me to ask , but what 's your budget ? ' That 's not usually done here . They can then laugh at how American I am , but I still get to ask my question . " <p> American bluntness can be a big selling point for men or women ( though some say it 's more palatable when delivered by the latter ) . The fund-management firm Barclays Global Investors chose Stewart-Allen over a British man for a job currently underway , which involves retraining staff to be more direct when pursuing new clients . That 's not an unusual situation . " Americans have a great ability to jump into the heart of an issue , while we sort of flounder around a bit , " says Alastair King , a managing director at Galahad Capital who has worked on several projects with another American , Lucy Marcus of Marcus Venture Consulting . When asked if this approach causes culture clashes , King says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other way around . " <p> Americans in Britain are in a strong position to play the role of change agents . Bravo succeeded in transforming formerly stuffy British raincoat maker Burberry into a fashion label worn by such celebrities as Kate Moss and Sean ( P. Diddy ) Combs . Cassani proved a major airline could compete with the cheap carriers when she took over Go for British Airways . Tyson , a former economic adviser to Bill Clinton , is updating tenure and fund-raising procedures at the London Business School . Beverly Malone , also a former Clinton adviser ( on health care ) , is pushing the issue of better pay for nurses as head of Britain 's ( and the world 's ) largest nursing union . <p> During the late- ' 90s boom , several younger American women capitalized on the European desire to adopt Yankee business culture . The women launched start-ups and networking groups , and generally became more comfortable with hype and the limelight . A California-born venture capitalist named Julie Meyer founded First Tuesday , which staged high-profile mixers for dot-com types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Floridian Robin Saunders was the It Girl of London finance , turning the German bank West LB into a player . An April study by the research group Catalyst found that American female executives , in contrast to their European counterparts , believed choosing highly visible projects was one of the five most important ways to get ahead . <p> The study also found that European women were slightly less optimistic about career prospects than Americans . This reflects what may be the most important reason behind the clout of American women in Britain  --  the relative lack of opportunities for British women . Women hold 12.4 percent of board seats in the United States , but only 6.2 percent in Britain . Likewise , while 45 percent of Fortune 500 companies have more than one woman on their boards , only 15 percent of top British companies do . <p> Julie Mellor , head of Britain 's Equal Opportunity Commission , ascribes this to an old boys ' culture : " British boards have not professionalized their selection process . " British firms also are not legally required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hire , as many American firms are . Ironically , many American women say that a less modern , diverse and competitive business culture is one reason for their success . " Quite frankly , Britain is a pretty easy place to come and do a good job , " says venture capitalist Ruth Storm , an American who began her career in London 19 years ago as a typist . <p> No doubt British women could make an impact if there were more of them on the executive track . American women have been in the workplace in large numbers for a longer period of time . While 72 percent of American women with dependent children work , 65 percent of British women do . After a second baby , 56 percent of American mothers with two children ( and at least one preschooler ) choose to work , compared with 47 percent of Britons . British women also take much more time off for maternity leave , and spend more time with their kids during the day . And British mothers engage in part-time work in much higher percentages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women are on a slower track , but the reasons are hotly debated . Mellor blames inadequate child care and a lack of career opportunities . Others , like London School of Economics researcher Catherine Hakim , believe British women simply prefer a more balanced life . Lesley Knox , a British high flier , is one of many who are trying to find the right way forward . After several big jobs , including a directorship at Kleinwort Benson , she 's begun moving into non-executive-director roles so she can spend more time with her young daughter . " British women are trying really , really hard to get the balance right , and maybe American women just do n't fuss as much about it anymore , " she says . She 's got a point . In the best-selling novel " I Do n't Know How She Does It , " a Lon-don fund manager and mother frantically uses a rolling pin to " distress " store-bought mince pies into looking homemade for her child 's school party . It 's hard to imagine many working Wall Street moms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe is not as ready to embrace the unconflicted businesswoman . A survey of European directors shows that stereotypes of women 's abilities and a lack of female role models are among the top barriers to advancement . Yet the trends that attract Americans  --  globalization and modernization  --  may eventually put more British women in positions of power . British and European Union legislators are encouraging companies to get more aggressive about hiring and promoting women . The EOC is quietly pushing the issue of women on corporate boards and campaigning for better child care . Progressive companies like British Telecom , British Petroleum and Shell have launched mentoring programs designed to get even more women into the uppermost ranks . Someday , British women may hold as much power in British business as American women do . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Not from here : Scardino is chief of Pearson <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : High-Flying : Cassani proved that British Airways could compete with budget carriers <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Making Waves : Tyson , formerly an economic adviser to President Clinton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By Rana Foroohar <p> With Liat Radcliffe , in London <p>
