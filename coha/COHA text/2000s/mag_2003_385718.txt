For John N. Booth , a Chicago-area artist , teacher , and former professional musician , value relationships orchestrate prizewinning paintings . <p> The Best in Show award at the American Artists Professional League 's Grand National Exhibition last fall went to The Swan , a daringly composed painting of a cellist performing . The musician 's head and hands are strongly illuminated , perhaps from a stage spotlight . Except for a small area of background behind the head , the rest of the space in the painting lives in deep , suggestive shadow . " Lives " is the correct word for this large area of darkness ; it is not merely an absence , but a presence filled with hints of forms and sounds . The cello 's bridge , its strings , the bow , and the warm , polished wood of the instrument 's body are all just barely visible , and offer an uncanny visual correspondence to the cello 's characteristic low , serious range  --  the musical backbone of the orchestra 's string section . The player 's hands and head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . Her right hand holds the bow delicately with the fingertips , while the fingers of the left hand , pressing the strings , exhibit maximum tension . Yet , her face is relaxed , her eyes are closed , and she seems transported to another realm by the music that arrives at her ear by way of the cello 's neck as a series of long , fluid brushstrokes . Those brushstrokes actually depict the cellist 's hair , but they are also expressive symbols of the painting 's real subject : the transforming power of music . <p> " Music is the essence of all art , " asserts John N. Booth , the artist who painted The Swan . " It does n't need to represent anything . It is pure architecture , pure emotion . If you understand music , you 're well on your way toward understanding all art . " Booth says he wants his work to aspire to the state of music , while respecting the craft , traditions , and inherent representational nature of the visual medium . " Lines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , at times , to be ' musical ' or to ' dance , ' " he remarks . " I 've had people tell me , while looking at The Swan , that they could almost hear music . That 's the kind of thing I 'm trying to achieve . " <p> Underlying the romantic realism of Booth 's art is a rock-solid understanding of the principles of value relationships , which for him means the orchestration of contrasts between light and dark passages , both to clarify the composition and intensify its dramatic and emotional impact . Booth spent many years drawing with charcoal in his effort to comprehend and master those principles , and he still draws , independent of his paintings , as a way of discovering new possibilities to " score " his compositions . <p> The artist says he prefers charcoal because of its similarity to painting . " I see charcoal as a mass medium rather than a linear medium , " he notes . " A jumbo charcoal stick is like a No. 10 bristle brush full of paint . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily . So , even though I keep drawing and painting as separate disciplines , my approach to each is basically the same . " <p> A look at some of Booth 's drawings reveals four sequential stages in his creative process . In a portrait study shown on page 24 , first the artist sketched the big shapes of the head and body roughly and quickly with a few lines . Next , he massed in the big shadow behind the head and smudged it over the area that would become the face . Third , he picked out the lights in the face and hair by erasing areas of the shadow . Fourth , he restated and strengthened some of the lines  --  at the collar , around the mouth , nose , and eyes , and along the right side of the head  --  not so much to correct contours as to create sharp , dark accents that heighten the contrast with the lights . <p> Booth 's method in oil painting is just as logical and direct , and it is governed by his concern for getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil or charcoal underdrawings on his canvases , he found that step inhibiting and has discarded it . He explains , " Now I begin with paint , making some general indications for placement of the masses . Most of these get lost and restated as work progresses . " After that , Booth proceeds according to what he calls " the funnel effect , " starting big , committing only to what is needed , and gradually funneling down to detail as he becomes more sure of the relationships  --  working from the general to the specific . <p> In The Scent of Roses , the artist arrived at the complex , flickering effect of sunlight and shadow , first by dividing his canvas into two large areas of light and dark . The figure unites these areas  --  her hat and blouse belong to the upper light area , her dress and basket belong to the lower dark area . Against both the light and the dark areas , Booth strewed splashes of contrasting values : the roses in the foreground , arranged in a circular pattern over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper light area . The color he uses , while rich , is never allowed to become saturated or to break out of the structure established by the values . It sounds natural and easy  --  yet , it took Booth years of experimentation to pare his creative process down to these few essential steps . " For most of my life as an artist , I 've struggled to get away from excessive finish , " Booth avers . " I 'm at the point where that is no longer a concern , and I 'm able to paint as I like . But it 's been a long , hard road . " <p> A native of New York City who now lives with his wife and son in suburban Chicago , Booth has moved back and forth between the worlds of music and visual art several times in his life . At the age of 12 , he read a biography of Sargent , and became familiar with what Booth terms the " loose but accurate way of thinking " that influenced him as a painter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a vocation . He explains , " Most of the art schools and university art departments at the time were focused more on ' self-expression ' and less on the things I was interested in learning  --  namely , sound academic drawing and the craft of traditional painting . " In music education , Booth found the discipline , structure , and respect for craft and tradition that he was searching for . He became accomplished on the viola and performed professionally for more than a decade with many chamber-music groups and orchestras . As his understanding of a wide range of musical styles deepened , so too did his appreciation for the physical elements of the performers ' world . " As I got to know many other musicians , " he recalls , " I noticed the beautiful shapes of the instruments they played , and the equally beautiful postures , attitudes , facial expressions , and hand positions of the performers themselves , plus the lovely ambience of musical events  --  and I quickly found performing musicians to be very attractive subject matter for paintings . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try painting again , but finding that the art-school approach had changed little in 15 years , he resolved to teach himself . Through his training in music he had learned that there were no shortcuts to mastering an art form ; to master painting , ahead of him lay years of diligent practice , particularly in drawing . His mature technique in charcoal owes much to the " classic " period of American magazine illustration of the mid-20th century . " I believe that the real American art of the period , from 1920 to 1960 , was found not in galleries and museums of contemporary art , but in illustrated books and magazines , advertisements , even on billboards , " Booth contends . " Certain American illustrators were the greatest artists of the period . Their pictures succeeded in the way all good pictures do , on their intrinsic merits , by the exploitation of all the attributes and possibilities possessed by the media in which the artists worked . " <p> When teaching , Booth tries to wean his students away from their desire for quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish a drawing or a painting soon after they 've begun , " he observes . " But artwork , like most other crafts , has a beginning , a middle , and an end . The way you work in the beginning is very different from the way you work in the middle or the end . If you start drawing in detail at the outset and after an hour 's work you 've got the most beautiful mouth you 've ever drawn , but it 's in the wrong place , in the wrong relationship to the other parts , the tendency will be not to wipe it out and start again . Because of the time and care expended on it , it will be left and ' lived with . ' And that 's the death of the drawing . " <p> Booth prepares his students for the feeling of insecurity they should expect when beginning a new work . " I tell students to assume that , even when trying their best to be accurate in placing the big facts , everything they do at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work progresses . " He strongly discourages the use of artificial aids such as rulers or grids while drawing and painting . " Real drawing  --  that is , real seeing  --  is done with the brain , " he asserts . " The brain must be taught to work independently as an organ of acute perception . Any attempt to shortcut the process stifles the character and originality of the artist . And only when we 're so comfortable with the process that we 're almost unconscious of it do we become capable of originality . " <p> The clear , deliberate sequence of steps that Booth practices and recommends is like the sequence of steps a musician must follow , both in learning to play an instrument and in practicing before each performance . He believes that the same rules apply to beginner and master alike . Far from inhibiting creative expression , the rules actually facilitate it by helping the artist communicate effectively to the audience . " Many of us reach adulthood thinking art is merely self-expression , and art schools and much of the art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But visual art is communication . If an artist paints a picture and shows it to no one , it may be art , but not totally . It 's like a great singer performing a beautiful song only for herself . It 's only half the story . " The implication is that the rest of the story  --  be it musical or pictorial  --  takes place in the mind of the listener and the beholder . The purpose of the exercise should not be the pursuit of mastery for its own sake , and still less the conscious pursuit of originality or novelty , which as Booth says , " is an empty thing and has nothing , by itself , to do with art . " The purpose , as Booth shows us in his paintings , is to awaken in other individuals , one by one , a sense of the musical architecture of reality , the emotional and spiritual underpinnings of the world in which we live . <p> A signature member of Oil Painters of America , Booth has had his art recognized in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to his award from the American Artists Professional League , he received Best in Show prizes at the Breckenridge ( Texas ) Fine Arts Center 's 11th Annual National Juried Exhibition and the 17th Annual National Competition of the Bosque Conservatory in Clinton , Texas .
