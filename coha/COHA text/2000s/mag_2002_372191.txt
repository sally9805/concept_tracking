The Enron Mess <P> I am perplexed that the Enron situation is considered a scandal THE ENRON SPILLOVER , Feb. 4 . It seems to me this is the epitome of Republican philosophy and policy : remove resources from the worker bees of America as quickly and efficiently as possible and concentrate them in the assets of the wealthy . The Enron collapse just continues what deficit spending and tax breaks for the wealthy have done to widen the income gap since the 1980s . PAMELA MULLER St. Petersburg , Fla . <P> Enron is not an aberration but the tip of a special-interest iceberg endangering Americans ' future economic security . This is not a time for political rhetoric and blame placing by the White House and Congress . There is a growing corrupt and evil collaboration between government and business leadership in Washington . It involves many Republicans and Democrats in the Legislative and Executive branches who provide regulatory protection to U.S. corporations , unions and associations for campaign money . It 's time to dissolve this corrupt capitalist partnership . CRAIG KAISER Arroyo Grande , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little deterrent effect on a holdup man . Top executives , however , understand penalties . If they were sure that criminal fraud would get them 10 to 15 years in a penitentiary , they would think long and hard before committing the kind of deceit that went on at Enron . BILL RICHMOND Carmichael , Calif . <P> Your article danced around the idea of a possible White House scandal while offering the weakest support of the allegations I have ever read . So five years ago , while George W. Bush was Governor of Texas , Karl Rove recommended Ralph Reed for a job at Enron . How is that illegal or unethical ? And a few sentences in a government report may have been altered at the suggestion of Ken Lay . But that is unimportant , because the energy policy the report advocated was never enacted by Congress . You need to focus on fair and balanced reporting . DAN LONG Huntingdon Valley , Pa . <P> I am frightened for our domestic security and financial safety when the White House holds secret talks to protect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protecting the American people , or are they only looking after their friends in Big Business ? RANDY E. HENDERSON Romney , W.Va . <P> Call me cynical , but the Enron house of cards is an example of modern American capitalism at its " finest " : elected officials being influenced by huge sums of money , top executives making off with millions of dollars and having cozy political relationships , the White House refusing to talk , and regular folks left holding the proverbial bag . For my money , fraud , greed and corruption certainly should bring down a government  --  but they wo n't . JAMES P. MORGAN Gardnerville , Nev . <P> You have n't found anything connecting the White House with Enron in any meaningful way . People wo n't be fooled by the Democrats ' attempt to smear this Administration . The Dems might just shoot themselves in the foot . MARY S. BELL El Cajon , Calif.
