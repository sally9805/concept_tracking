GET OUT MORE ! Headnote BACKPACKER 'S FITNESS PROGRAM Headnote WISH YOU COULD LEAP TALL MOUNTAINS IN A Headnote SINGLE BOUND ? HERE 'S AN EXERCISE PROGRAM DESIGNED FOR BACKPACKERS WHO WANT TO Headnote SING THE PRAISES OF WIDE-OPEN SPACES WHILE OTHERS ARE CURSING EACH SWITCHBACK. // Winter 's last few flakes are melting , flower buds are bursting , and thoughts drift to summer backpacking adventures . Imagine hopping gracefully over boulders , scrambling up rough trails with ease , stopping to enjoy the view without wheezing or panting . Picture yourself springing out of the tent each morning , muscles rejuvenated and ready for action . The question is : After a winter of sloth , how do you make the transformation to surefooted , iron  --  lunged mountain goat ? By beginning a year  --  round program that builds strong muscles and aerobic endurance . " Getting in shape is important so you can better enjoy your trip , go farther , and not feel as if you 're working so hard , " says David Musnick , M.D. , a sports medicine specialist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fitness ( The Mountaineers , 800-553  --  4453 ; **28;1498;TOOLONG ; $21.95 ) . " Plus , you 'll probably have fewer injuries . " Now , that does n't mean you have to shell out big bucks for a fancy gym membership . To stay in tip-top shape , you need only invest half an hour a day and employ a few household items . What follows is a get-fit regimen created specifically for backpackers by exercise experts who know what it takes to haul a pack . Our program is designed for weekend adventurers and long  --  trail crusaders alike . If you 've been sick or injured and have n't exercised recently , get your doctor 's approval before starting this routine . We also include modifications to the base program for those who are either less fit ( be honest now ! ) or more advanced . AEROBIC CONDITIONING Backpacking is all about breathing deeply and moving those legs . So make similar aerobic activities , such as walking , running , step aerobics , swimming , or cycling , the foundation of your training program . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since hiking is about maintaining a steady pace , not sprinting . That means training at 60 to 70 percent of your maximum heart rate ( see " In A Heartbeat " on page 119 ) . Start and end each workout with a 5-minute warm-up and cooldown . This basic aerobic conditioning regimen focuses on walking , since that 's what you 'll be doing on the trail , and includes : * a 40-minute brisk walk twice a week * a 30-minute brisk walk twice a week Six weeks before your first trip , add one long , low-intensity hike on walking trails or in hilly areas ( to reach 50 to 60 percent of your maximum heart rate ) . Walk no more than half the distance and gain no more than half the elevation that you expect to hike on each day of your trip . For instance , if you plan to hike 10 miles a day on steep terrain , your walk should be no longer than 5 miles on moderate hills . This conservative approach builds strength with little risk of injury . Rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long hike . Then rest on 2 . FOR THE LESS FIT Begin walking for 15 or 20 minutes three times a week , adding a minute to each walk or cross-training activity until you reach 30 minutes . Give yourself 4 to 6 weeks to reach 30 minutes , then use the basic program . FOR THE SUPPORT Up the 40-minute walk or other activity to 50 minutes . You can also add interval training once or twice a week . For instance , during your walk , insert four to six 30-second bursts of speedier walking or running . Slow down until your heart rate drops and your breathing slows to near normal . Repeat . You might also add an easy cross-training activity on a rest day . For an added challenge , use one of your rest days for an additional 30-minute fast walk . Add more aggressive intervals of five to seven speedy bursts of 60 to 90 seconds each . Also , make your long hike longer each week and incorporate up to 75 percent of the elevation gain you 'll face on any given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light pack to build endurance and upper-body strength . MUSCLE STRENGTHENING In your backyard or local park , use household weights ( see page 119 ) and a curb to strengthen your hill-climbing , pack  --  carrying muscles . Which muscles are those ? " The butt , the butt , and the butt , " says Mark Pierce , Dr. Musnick 's coauthor and a certified athletic trainer in Bellevue , Washington . Actually , he 's referring to all the buttocks  --  supporting muscles , including those in the hips , thighs , and calves , plus your hamstrings and abdominal muscles . You 'll also need to work your shoulder and chest muscles . These basic exercises will get those muscles in high gear , so add them to your regimen three times a week , beginning 6 to 8 weeks before your trip . Do two or three sets , performing the most repetitions and using the heaviest weights in the first set , then decreasing reps and weight for each following set . Lunges with biceps curls A : Stand with your feet apart and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand with your arms hanging at your sides . B : Step forward with one foot , letting your knee bend when the foot lands . Make sure that when you land , your bent knee remains over your foot , not in front of it . At the same time , flex the opposite arm so that your palm lifts toward your shoulder . Push back to a standing position by straightening your knee and stepping back as you lower your hand . Repeat on the opposite side . Squats Stand with your feet apart and in line with your hips . Bend your knees and lower your buttocks , as if you are going to sit on a chair . Keep your back straight , your abs tight , and your knees behind your toes . Squat as low as you can while keeping your torso upright and your heels on the floor . Return to a standing position . Holding a ball behind your head with both hands will help you maintain a straight posture , or push it above your head , toward the ceiling , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs with their backs toward you . Put your hands on the backs of the chairs and , moving your feet behind you and bending your knees balance on your toes . if : Then lower your weight between the chairs by using your chest and arm muscles . If your arms feel stressed , put more weight on your toes . Keep your back upright . Push up with your chest and arms to return to a standing position . Step-ups Stand facing a curb or low platform . Step up onto it with your right foot , lifting your left foot off the ground as you straighten your right knee . Place your left foot on the step to finish . Return to the starting position by placing your left foot on the ground , then bringing the right foot down . You can complete the set 's repetitions with the right foot and then switch to the left , or you can alternate sides . FOR THE LESS FIT Start with two strength-training sessions a week , and use lighter weights or eliminate them . Add a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do squats with a bench or chair in front of you , or use ski or trekking poles to support yourself . For stepups , choose a very low curb . For assisted dips , let more of your body weight rest on your toes . FOR THE SUPPORT Lift more weight or add challenges such as stepping onto a curb with your front foot for lunges or speeding up the reps . Wear a weighted pack . Try unassisted dips by taking your feet off the ground as you lower yourself . BALANCE TRAINING Imagine gliding along a narrow , ridge  --  line trail with 60-foot drop-offs , or springing from rock to rock in a river crossing , wearing a heavy pack all the while . Now imagine tumbling down the mountainside or splashing through the river . That 's why you need to work on balance . Here 's the secret : Keep your abdominal muscles tight . Complete a selection of these exercises two or three times a week in as little as 5 minutes total . Multidirectional lunges Do lunges as described for muscle strengthening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weights ; keep your hands on your hips instead . This time , you 'll step not only forward to lunge , but also to each side ( pointing your toes in the direction of the lunge ) and backward ( lowering your buttocks as if to squat ) . Try this on a soft surface like a mat , sand , or thick grass ; the unstable footing will make your abs work harder . Clock log reach Pretend there 's a clock face drawn on the ground and stand at the center of it . Lift one foot off the ground and , without changing the direction you 're facing , point with your toes to all of the hours on the clock . Alternate directions as you get better , pointing first , for example , at the 10 , then the 5 , then the 2 , and finally the 12 . Having a partner call numbers randomly to catch you off-guard will increase the difficulty . Single-leg stance with chop A : Stand on your left leg with your knee slightly bent . Clasp your hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Move your clasped hands quickly from right shoulder to left hip . Then change sides , standing on your right leg and moving your clasped hands from your left shoulder to your right hip . You can rotate your torso to the right and left as your balance improves . Ball toss Stand on one foot with your knee slightly bent and face a partner wh ( also is standing on oni foot . Toss a ball back and forth , catching it in both hands . FOR BALANCE NOVICES Skip the ball toss and do n't add spinal rotation to the single-leg stance with chop . Keep both feet flat on the floor for the clock leg reach and single  --  leg stance with chop . Stop if you start to feel uncomfortable . FOR BALANCE PROS Try lifting yourself onto your toes during the leg reach , single-leg stance , and ball toss exercises . Stand on a less firm surface , like foam or sand . Hold a child 's ball , medicine ball , or hand weights . Or , if you are n't holding anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TRAINING Whether they 're used to hoist your bear bag or pull you over a boulder , flexible muscles will do the job , without pulling or straining . All hikers , no matter what their level of experience , should stretch at least three times a week at home and daily on the trail . Save your flexibility training for the end of a workout , when your muscles are warm . Hold each stretch for 15 to 30 seconds and repeat two to five times . Achilles tendons/calves A : Stand facing a wall , and press your hands against the wall so that your arms are straight and at shoulder height . Extend one foot behind you , with your heel on the ground and your toes facing forward . B : Bend your front leg while keeping your back leg straight . Hold . Then , with your front leg still bent , bend your back leg , keeping your heel on the ground ( Tip : Move your back foot a little forward ) . Hold . Relax and repeat on the other side . Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shoulders and your knees directly under your hips . Inhale slowly , then tuck in your chin , arch your back , and tuck your hips under slightly . Hold . If you 're stretching correctly , your back will be in an asymmetrical arch , like a Halloween cat . Then exhale and relax your back without relaxing your abs ; at the same time , lift your chin to look ahead of you ( not up ) and lift your buttocks slightly . Repeat , moving slowly and carefully . Hamstrings Stand in front of a knee-high , sturdy object . Place the heel of one foot on the object , standing tall and keeping both knees straight . If you feel any discomfort , look for a lower object . Lean your torso forward ( not down ! ) and hold . Switch legs and repeat . Quadriceps Stand a foot or two away from and with your back to a chair back or desk . Using your right leg , bend your knee and lift your leg behind you so that you can place the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tighten your buttocks and extend your pelvis slightly forward . Hold , then do the same with your left leg . HEALTHY TIPS MODIFICATIONS FOR THE MIDDLE-AGED If you 're a man over 40 or a woman over 50 , modify the program outlined here , suggests Jim Sloan , author of Staying Fit Over Fifty ( The Mountaineers , 800  --  553-4453 ; www. backpacker.com/ bookstore ; $19.95 ) . * Progress slowly and pay attention to your body . * Take 2 or 3 days off-or go very easy  --  after a hard workout , instead of taking 1 or 2 days off . That means fewer hard workouts . * If a long , hilly hike tires your leg muscles , do n't jump right into a muscle-strengthening leg workout the next day . Give your muscles extra recovery time . * Do n't skip strength training . You lose muscle and bone density as you age , but strength training helps maintain them . * Do n't neglect flexibility exercises , because tissues tend to dry and stiffen with age . Troubleshooting Move slowly until you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If something hurts , do n't do it , or modify the routine . Dr. Musnick also advises : If you have knee problems : Stick to flat surfaces and avoid stepping downhill when doing lunges or other stepping exercises . Do n't run downhill or descend stairs as a part of a workout . Lunges and squats , as described on page 58 , will strengthen the fronts of your thighs and your buttocks , which can help take pressure off your knees . If you have back problems : Avoid rotational movements unless your doctor has approved them . Take extra care not to twist your back if you use a cross-country ski machine . Lift your backpack safely by lowering yourself to one knee to swing the pack onto your back ; better yet , have a hiking partner hoist the pack onto your back . Always keep your abdominal muscles tightened for support . Do plenty of balance training to develop strong abs , since they support your back muscles . If you have ankle problems : Strengthen them with one-leg balances , gradually moving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have shoulder problems : Add strengtheners such as assisted dips , assisted pull-ups ( standing on a chair or having a friend support your lower body ) , and modified push-ups on your knees ( supporting your weight on your hands and knees instead of on your hands and toes ) . In A Heartbeat How to calculate your target heart rate . Since backpacking is n't a high-speed sport , you do n't need to train at high speed . Exercising at 60 to 70 percent of your maximum heart rate is adequate . To determine your target heart rate , use the formula below , and then check your pulse while you 're exercising . Adjust the workout 's intensity to reach your target . If you 're alley gic to math , use the Heart Rate Calculator at **27;1528;TOOLONG . Subtract your age from 220 ( 226 if you 're a woman ) to find your theoretical maximum heart rate . Multiply the result by the percentage of your maximum heart rate at which you want to exercise to find your target heart rate . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate is 185 ( 220 - 35 = 185 ) . If you want to work out at 60 to 70 percent of that , multiply 185 by .60 ( which equals 111 ) and .70 ( which equals 130 ) . For hiking workouts , then , your heart rate during training should be 111 to 130 beats per minute .
