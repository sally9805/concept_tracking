<p> RATING : ( ALERT VIEWER ) <p> HAMLET : Tragedy . By William Shakespeare . Directed by Libby Appel . ( Through October 7 . At the Elizabethan Theatre . ) <p> RATING : ( POLITE APPLAUSE ) <p> TWELFTH NIGHT : Comedy . By William Shakespeare . Directed by Timothy Bond . ( Through October 8 . At the Elizabethan Theatre . ) <p> Do n't be fooled by that quiet , composed fellow with his arms crossed and hair pulled neatly back in the first scene of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival 's " Hamlet . " <p> Marco Barricelli is a volcano waiting to erupt in the title role . Thunderous speeches , violent outbursts , shaggy hair set free and flying , a wild kiss to the lips of his hated uncle Claudius  --  it all comes spewing forth . Once this Hamlet gets rolling , the famously ruminative Danish prince never seems to hesitate at all . <p> FESTIVAL IN FULL SWING <p> The festival itself is operating at full force itself now , with " Hamlet , " " Twelfth Night " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the outdoor Elizabethan Theatre . Visitors to the West Coast 's largest resident theater may now catch nine plays in three houses clustered in this southern Oregon town . <p> " Wit " closes this week at the Black Swan , and " The Night of the Iguana " goes on hiatus July 9 at the Angus Bowmer Theatre . Two more productions  --  " Stop Kiss " and " The Trojan Women "  --  open next month . The festival plays to a total audience of 375,000 over an eight-month season running through October . About a fourth of this rural theater 's pilgrims hail from the Bay Area . <p> In an unorthodox opening to what turns out to be a pretty blunt account of Shakespeare 's febrile tragedy , the audience is plunged immediately into " Hamlet 's " corrupted court at Elsinore . By reversing the play 's first two scenes , director Libby Appel delays the first visitations by the ghost of Hamlet 's father . In fact , with Barry Kraft doing potent voice-over duty in the role , the murdered king is never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's an intriguing idea , one of several in Appel 's staging . A disembodied ghost increases the temperature of Hamlet 's fevered imagination . It also gives a canny boost to the scene in his mother 's bedroom . Like Gertrude ( a sympathetic Demetra Pittman ) , we ca n't see what 's tormenting her son so intently . It 's no wonder this woman takes to drink . <p> Barricelli , a high-voltage actor well known to American Conservatory Theater audiences in recent years ( " A Streetcar Named Desire , " " Long Day 's Journey Into Night " ) , hits some vivid peaks here . Riveted by the ghost 's plea for revenge , he looks deeply haunted in a downstage spotlight , as if his pulse and breathing were now permanently quickened to the cause . He brings a broad , rangy force , along with a symphonically rich voice that occasionally overwhelms the verse , to several of the soliloquies . <p> He also flashes a buoyant enthusiasm for the traveling actors and bemused detachment when two school chums transparently betray him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. Valmont Thomas ) are portrayed as a pair of glossy bald dupes , a kind of vaudeville-for-hire duo in modern dress . <p> Between its strongly played moments , the production misses too much of the play 's variegation . The open-throttle Barricelli steamrolls his way past an uneven cast . Deidrie Henry plays Ophelia as a listless nonentity , then singsongs through a stagey breakdown . Laird Williamson , best known as a director , makes a pallid Claudius . Richard Farrell 's Polonius has an amusing look , with his bad comb-over and smoking-jacket pretentions , but this fussbudget fool comes into focus slowly . <p> DISTINCTIVE ROLES <p> Ken Albers makes the most of his opportunity in a sly and stirring turn as the Player King . David Kelly 's loyal Horatio and U. Jonathan Toppo 's fiery Laertes are distinctive presences . <p> Appel , displaying her customary flair for spectacle , mounts the play-within-the-play as an eerie masque ( well lit by Robert Peterson ) . The action is punctuated by bursts of light and sound that nail the actors in their tracks . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexity . This " Hamlet " blows past a son 's tormented feelings for his mother or a brash young lover 's wavering insecurity . Being haunted , however powerfully , does n't compass all that Shakespeare dreamed of in this enormous , enigmatic role . <p> In one of the other important new productions , " Twelfth Night " transports the audience , for no particular reason , to an Illyria that looks and sounds a lot like Morocco . It turns out to be a lively trip . <p> AN EXOTIC NIGHT ' <p> Atmosphere , the comic roles and some neatly oiled hinges in the staging are the strong suits of Timothy Bond 's production . But the show never seizes or bedevils the heart with its round-robin romance and ambient sexuality . Belly dancers , bare midriffs and the North African perfume of the music do n't manage to get the amorous juices flowing . <p> A shipwreck , simply but effectively done , begins the story . A twin sister and brother are flung out from under the enormous cape of the play 's charismatic fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon to love . <p> Viola ( Vilma Silva ) disguises herself as a man , inadvertently seduces a countess ( Catherine Lynn Davis as Olivia ) and falls for the Duke Orsino ( Armando Duran ) . Viola 's brother Sebastian ( John Hansen ) makes a late appearance , gets tumbled into the avid Olivia 's bed and helps get the couples appropriately paired . <p> Silva is too plainly earnest , Davis too bubbly and Duran too vague to capture the play 's alluring friction . Love happens here mostly because the script says it does . <p> The play 's ebullience comes from the comic characters . Robed in black and perched on stick legs , John Pribyl plays Olivia 's steward Malvolio as an arrogant , adenoidal crow . He 's a bird easily plucked by Ray Porter 's slovenly , fast-tongued Sir Toby Belch and his partner in crime Maria ( Susan Champion ) . <p> As their confederate and dupe-to-be Sir Andrew Aguecheek , Dan Donohue gives one of those performances that can make a night under the stars at Ashland so sweet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . From his first Freudian slip from " jest " to " chest , " Donohue gives Sir Andrew a wobbly , irresistible grace . He dances like a marionette unaware of the jerking strings , totes his security-blanket golf clubs to a duel and registers each disappointment on a comically long face fringed with orange page-boy hair with freshly dawning optimism . <p> This " Twelfth Night " may not capture all the comedy 's music . But there are plenty of deft passing notes along the way . Watch how much Malvolio reads into Olivia 's meaningless touch , or the way he goes sprinting after the wrong twin for an instant . Sir Toby picks up a kind of radio feed from " Hamlet . " Some expert antics light up the hide-and-taunt letter scene that gulls Malvolio . <p> CREATIVE TREATMENT OF ENDING <p> The ending is especially choice . Instead of using Feste 's final song as a tender epilogue to the play 's symmetrical love matches , firmly staged here , Bond enlarges the gesture . Exiting in front of the dancing lovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suddenly serious futures out there in the wind and the rain . <p> The play has been an interlude , a sunny lark . Now , as they all depart by moonlight to a minor-key song , the real business of living begins . <p>  --   --   --  <p> TOMORROW : " The Taming of the Shrew .
