Doctors still do n't know what exactly causes schizophrenia , a devastating mental illness characterized by extremely disordered thinking . They 're pretty sure that some kind of genetic predisposition is at work . But they also suspect that environmental triggers  --  particularly at critical moments during the brain 's development before birth  --  play a role . That 's why the results of a study published last week in the Archives of General Psychiatry are so intriguing . For the first time , researchers have direct evidence that exposure to influenza in utero is tied to a greater likelihood that an individual will someday develop schizophrenia . <P> That does n't mean that the link between influenza and schizophrenia is airtight . " It 's really important to duplicate these results , " says Dr. Alan Brown , a psychiatrist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute in New York City , who led the study . But the new findings fit a pattern that has been emerging since researchers noticed a spike in cases of schizophrenia among people born in Denmark in 1957 during a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood-serum samples taken from HMO patients who were pregnant between 1959 and 1966 . Then they zeroed in on those women whose children later developed schizophrenia . The researchers discovered that the presence of influenza antibodies  --  a sure sign of infection  --  during the first half of pregnancy correlated with a threefold greater risk of schizophrenia . There was no correlation with influenza during the second half of pregnancy . <P> Why would exposure to influenza during pregnancy increase the risk of schizophrenia ? No one knows . Perhaps the infection somehow damages the developing brain . Or the reason may have something to do with how influenza affects the mother 's lungs , decreasing the amount of oxygen that can get to the fetus . But even if the link is real , it would account for just 14% of schizophrenia cases . <P> Developing influenza during pregnancy carries its own more immediate risks and often requires hospitalization . That is why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all women who are or plan to be pregnant during flu season get vaccinated starting in the fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hands regularly and steer clear of anyone who 's sneezing.
