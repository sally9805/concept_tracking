<p> San Francisco  --  Walk up the steep concrete ramp from the dock to the castle-like fortress on the hill , and it feels almost like there 's no escape . <p> Wind through the spartan shower room , hear the doors slam in the pitch-dark isolation cells of " the Hole " in Cell Block D , and real fear sets in . <p> See the photos of the inmates , listen to the voices of the guards , smell the dampness in the chilly Pacific air , and it 's not hard to imagine what day-to-day life was like on the Rock . <p> " You 're walking literally in the footsteps of inmates , " said Katy Olds , a lawyer turned tour guide who is associate director for visitor programs for the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy , which helps operate Alcatraz . <p> In the biggest makeover since the infamous prison was opened to tourists more than 30 years , ago , the Conservancy and the National Park Service have just completed a $3.5 million renovation of Alcatraz that includes new exhibits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to do is make it a more authentic experience for visitors , " Olds explained . <p> Prisoners may have hated the Rock , but more than 1.4 million people visit Alcatraz each year , making it one of the most popular tourist attractions in the country . Visiting San Francisco without taking the 12-minute boat ride to Alcatraz is like touring central Texas without seeing the Alamo or going on a Florida vacation without walking along the beach . <p> The makeover of Alcatraz does n't take anything away from the depressing isolation and dark atmosphere of the country 's best-known prison . <p> Sure , the new gift shop and bookstore is about three times bigger than the old one . But along with additional kitschy souvenirs ( if a T-shirt wo n't do , how about an official Alcatraz bar of soap or a fork and spoon stamped with the prison 's initials ? ) , it now contains interpretive displays , such as a case full of shivs made by prisoners , handcuffs and leather lead-filled saps used by guards . <p> It even has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank Lee Morris and Clarence and John Anglin in what is considered by some to be the island 's only successful escape ( officially , the three are listed as missing and presumed drowned , but their bodies were never identified ) . <p> Similarly subtle additions and improvements were added throughout the prison 's Cell House as part of the makeover , which was completed at the end of April . <p> The changes begin where visitors first arrive on the island . Instead of the old route up some steps and through the warden 's office , visitors now walk up the same long ramp that greeted prisoners on their arrival . From there , they pass by the supply room where new inmates were issued their numbers and clothes , through the wide-open shower room and into the rows of cells . <p> Along the way , visitors can listen to a revamped audio tour , this one on a fancy new digital music player instead of the previous cassette tape player . Almost all of the narration is by actual former prisoners , guards and their families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to see prisoner Alvin " Creepy Karpis " Karpavicz to know there was something wrong with him . " He always walked on his toes , " one guard explains . <p> George " Machine Gun " Kelly never gave anybody any trouble , explains another , while Robert " the Birdman " Stroud was " brilliant " but also an " obnoxious ... suicidal psychopath . " <p> In other portions of the audio tour , prisoners talk of seeing the beckoning lights and hearing the tempting sounds of freedom a mile and a half across the bay in San Francisco . Family members of guards talk about what it was like to grow up on an island prison , which was in operation for 29 years before closing in March 1963 . <p> " We wanted to make it real " by connecting visitors to the source , said Chris Tellis , whose company , Antenna Audio , put together the audio tour using recordings it compiled over the years . " The people who actually called this place home are your tour guides . " ( Cox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to acquire Antenna Audio as part of its acquisition of the Travel Channel network . ) <p> Along with the recorded voices , Alcatraz curators are trying to add more real-life appearances by former prisoners , guards and others to the tour . <p> On a recent weekday , former Alcatraz inmate Darwin Coon sat in the new gift shop and bookstore , signing copies of his " Alcatraz : The True End of the Line " and answering visitors ' questions about the place . <p> " I spent a lot of my time right over there by those stairs , " he said , motioning to a corner where the prison 's butcher shop used to be . He worked in the shop while serving a sentence for bank robbery from 1959 to 1963 . <p> The improvements at his one-time home , Coon said , make it even more like it once was . <p> One of the most unexpected additions is the restoration of a small garden that privileged prisoners could visit and tend . The garden , planted inside the foundations of houses occupied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military base , was completely overgrown and forgotten for years before the restoration . <p> " I think our bottom-line hope is that visitors really feel that they experience what day-to-day life was like on Alcatraz  --  what it felt like to be a guard or an inmate or a family member of either , " said Greg Moore , executive director of the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy . <p> The nonprofit organization , which works with the National Park Service to maintain Alcatraz , raised the $3.5 million for the renovation from private donations and sales of tickets and souvenirs . <p> Not surprisingly , given that some structures on Alcatraz are a century old and constantly subject to the demanding nature of San Francisco Bay , some of the most expensive parts of the recent makeover were for structural improvements . Broken exterior staircases had to be replaced , building damage fixed , and  --  for access by the disabled  --  an elevator was added , Moore said . <p> " With historic buildings in a climate as harsh as this , just stabilizing and maintaining the structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But then , life on the Rock was always harsh .
