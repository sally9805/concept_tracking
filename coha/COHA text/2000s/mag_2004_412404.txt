Below : Back at Sea Base , a group of Scouts reflect on their weekend of adventure . // The Scouts of Troop 1482 , Cincinnati , Ohio , eagerly empty out of their boat and carry their gear 50 yards through waistdeep water to the shores of Big Munson Island , part of the Florida National High Adventure Sea Base . Eagle Scout Richard Stockdale trudges ashore with eyes wide open as he checks out the patch of sand that will be his home for the next week . Five-star hotel ? Hardly . This is tropical fun , Boy Scoutstyle . " We pretty much just brought a towel , sunscreen , bug spray , a sleeping pad and a flashlight , " says Richard , 17 . " There 's no reason to wash off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand on you wherever you go . " A little sand in your shorts and no running water is a small price to pay for a week of adventure : swimming , snorkeling , kayaking and fishing , all while camping on a 100-acre island that looks pretty much the same as it did 150 years ago . HOME BASE Troop 482 's Out Island Adventure is just one of the programs offered by Sea Base ( some even include air conditioning and hot-water showers ) . Each has the same goal : For Scouts to earn a greater knowledge and appreciation of sea life and water safety . Sea Base operates out of the Florida Keys . The main facility , in Islamorada , offers dormitories , food service and a supply shop . Guests can hit the high seas from boat docks . The base also has a swimming pool in which Scouts and Venturers can learn to use self-contained underwater breathing apparatus ( you know it as scuba gear ) .

Some guests arrive with their scuba certifications already in hand . They 're ready for the real thing : the Scuba Adventure program , which gives them the chance to explore underwater coral reefs-a hard , living structure that attracts fish and other sea life . " We saw a few thousand fish , " says Life Scout Paul Lipp , 16 , Troop 903 , Huntingtown , Md . " I mean , there was every kind of fish . " After the sun goes down , different kinds of fish come out . That 's why divers also get to take a night dive , in which each diver gets his own underwater flashlight . It 's one of up to nine dives during Scuba Adventure week . " You see a lot more bright-colored fish at night , " says Life Scout Zachary Schmitz , 16 , also with Troop 903 .

The captain told me the direction he wanted to go , and I did it . He said , Two four oh , ' 240 degrees , and I looked at the compass and went that direction . " When they were n't out on the ship 's deck , the Scouts were in the water . A snorkeling stop provided views of coral and fish . " We saw lots of good stuff , " says Venturer Andrew Kappler , 15 .

In between , there are several stops for snorkeling and fishing . Real-Life Robinson Crusoe Meanwhile , Troop 482 is still completely cut off from civilization , five and one-half miles off the coast of Florida . The Scouts spent much of their time hiking and exploring Big Munson , which is owned by the BSA and has absolutely no manmade facilities ( other than tents ) . It 's enough to remind Scouts of " Robinson Crusoe , " the novel about a sailor stuck on a deserted island . The rest of their trip was spent deep-sea fishing , shark-fishing and snorkeling . Troop 482 survived its Crusoe-like experience just fine . For Richard Stockdale , the highlight of the trip was discovering a new world under the water . For those who have never looked beneath the ocean 's surface while wearing goggles , it 's an eye-opening experience .

People have adapted by storing their goods above the animals ' reach . Legend has it that the raccoons and deer that live in the area have come up with a neat little trick of their own . Sea Base staff members say a Key deer , an endangered species that thrives on Munson Island , has been known to allow a Key Vaca raccoon to climb up its back to gain access to items that would otherwise be out of reach .
