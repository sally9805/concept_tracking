Much of Geoff Ryman 's work has shown a strong interest in Asia , including The Unconquered Country and more recent stories such as " The Last Ten Years in the Life of Hero Kai " ( from our Dec. 2005 issue ) , the award-winning novel Air , and his most recent book , The King 's Last Song . In case you ca n't guess from the title , his new story is about Cambodia . It 's completely untrue and highly compelling . <p> IN CAMBODIA PEOPLE ARE used to ghosts . Ghosts buy newspapers . They own property . A few years ago , spirits owned a house in Phnom Penh , at the Tra Bek end of Monivong Boulevard . Khmer Rouge had murdered the whole family and there was no one left alive to inherit it . People cycled past the building , leaving it boarded up . Sounds of weeping came from inside . Then a professional inheritor arrived from America . She 'd done her research and could claim to be the last surviving relative of no fewer than three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessman , who turned the ground floor into a photocopying shop . The copiers began to print pictures of the original owners . At first , single black and white photos turned up in the copied dossiers of aid workers or government officials . The father of the murdered family had been a lawyer . He stared fiercely out of the photos as if demanding something . In other photocopies , his beautiful daughters forlornly hugged each other . The background was hazy like fog . One night the owner heard a noise and trundled downstairs to find all five photocopiers printing one picture after another of faces : young college men , old women , parents with a string of babies , or government soldiers in uniform . He pushed the big green off-buttons . Nothing happened . He pulled out all the plugs , but the machines kept grinding out face after face . Women in beehive hairdos or clever children with glasses looked wistfully out of the photocopies . They seemed to be dreaming of home in the 1960s , when Phnom Penh was the most beautiful city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit the shop to identify lost relatives . Women would cry , " That 's my mother ! I did n't have a photograph ! " They would weep and press the flimsy A4 sheets to their breasts . The paper went limp from tears and humidity as if it too were crying . Soon , a throng began to gather outside the shop every morning to view the latest batch of faces . In desperation , the owner announced that each morning 's harvest would be delivered direct to The Truth , a. magazine of remembrance . Then one morning he tried to open the house-door to the shop and found it blocked . He went " round to the front of the building and rolled open the metal shutters . The shop was packed from floor to ceiling with photocopies . The ground floor had no windows - the room had been filled from the inside . The owner pulled out a sheet of paper and saw himself on the ground , his head beaten in by a hoe . The same image was on every single page . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The new owner liked its haunted reputation ; it kept people away . The FOR SALE sign was left hanging from the second floor . In a sense , the house had been bought by another ghost . This is a completely untrue story about someone who must exist . OL POT 'S ONLY CHILD , a daughter , was born in 1986 . Her name was Sith , and in 2004 , she was eighteen years old . Sith liked air conditioning and luxury automobiles . Her hair was dressed in cornrows and she had a spiky piercing above one eye . Her jeans were elaborately slashed and embroidered . Her pink T-shirts bore slogans in English : CARE KOOKY . PINK MOLL . Sith lived like a woman on Thai television , doing as she pleased in lipgloss and Sunsilked hair . Nine simple rules helped her avoid all unpleasantness . 1 . Never think about the past or politics . 2 . Ignore ghosts . They can not hurt you . 3 . Do not go to school . Hire tutors . Do n't do homework . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in either the Mercedes or the BMW. 5 . Avoid all well-dressed Cambodian boys . They are the sons of the estimated 250,000 new generals created by the regime . Their sons can behave with impunity. 6 . Avoid all men with potbellies . They eat too well and therefore must be corrupt . 7 . Avoid anyone who drives a Toyota Viva or Honda Dream motorcycle . 8 . Do n't answer letters or phone calls . 9 . Never make any friends . There was also a tenth rule , but that went without saying . Rotten fruit rinds and black mud never stained Sith 's designer sports shoes . Disabled beggars never asked her for alms . Her life began yesterday , which was effectively the same as today . Every day , her driver took her to the new Soriya Market . It was almost the only place that Sith went . The color of silver , Soriya rose up in many floors to a round glass dome . Sith preferred the 142nd Street entrance . Its green awning made everyone look as if they were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewelry rotunda with its floor of polished black and white stone . The individual stalls were hung with glittering necklaces and earrings . Sith liked tiny shiny things that had no memory . She hated politics . She refused to listen to the news . Pol Pot 's beautiful daughter wished the current leadership would behave decently , like her dad always did . To her . She remembered the sound of her father 's gentle voice . She remembered sitting on his lap in a forest enclosure , being bitten by mosquitoes . Memories of malaria had sunk into her very bones . She now associated forests with nausea , fevers , and pain . A flicker of tree-shade on her skin made her want to throw up and the odor of soil or fallen leaves made her gag . She had never been to Angkor Wat . She read nothing . Sith shopped . Her driver was paid by the government and always carried an AK-47 , but his wife , the housekeeper , had no idea who Sith was . The house was full of swept marble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screens . Please remember that every word of this story is a lie . Pol Pot was no doubt a dedicated communist who made no money from ruling Cambodia . Nevertheless , a hefty allowance arrived for Sith every month from an account in Switzerland . Nothing touched Sith , until she fell in love with the salesman at Hello Phones . Cambodian readers may know that in 2004 there was no mobile phone shop in Soriya Market . However , there was a branch of Hello Phone Cards that had a round blue sales counter with orange trim . This shop looked like that . Every day Sith bought or exchanged a mobile phone there . She would sit and flick her hair at the salesman . His name was Dara , which means Star . Dara knew about deals on call prices , sim cards , and the new phones that showed videos . He could get her any call tone she liked . Talking to Dara broke none of Sith 's rules . He was n't fat , nor was he well dressed , and far from being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . One day , Dara chuckled and said , " As a friend I advise you , you do n't need another mobile phone . " Sith wrinkled her nose . " I do n't like this one anymore . It 's blue . I want something more feminine . But not frilly . And it should have better sound quality . " " Okay , but you could save your money and buy some more nice clothes . " Pol Pot 's beautiful daughter lowered her chin , which she knew made her neck look long and graceful . " Do you like my clothes ? " " Why ask me ? " " She shrugged . " I do n't know . It 's good to check out your look . " Dara nodded . " You look cool . What does your sister say ? " Sith let him know she had no family . " Ah , " he said and quickly changed the subject . That was terrific . secrecy and sympathy in one easy movement . Sith came back the next day and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feminine . Dara laughed aloud and his eyes sparkled . Sith had come late in the morning just so that he could ask this question . " Are you hungry ? Do you want to meet for lunch ? " Would he think she was cheap if she said yes ? Would he say she was snobby if she said no ? " Just so long as we eat in Soriya Market , " she said . She was torn between BBWorld Burgers and Lucky 7 . BBWorld was big , round , and just two floors down from the dome . Lucky7 Burgers was part of the Lucky Supermarket , such a good store that a tiny jar of Maxwell House cost US$2.40 . They decided on BBWorld . It was full of light and they could see the town spread out through the wide clean windows . Sith sat in silence . Pol Pot 's daughter had nothing to say unless she was buying something . Or rather she had only one thing to say , but she must never say it . Dara did all the talking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get him a deal on original copies of Grand Theft Auto . He hinted that he could get Sith discounts from Bsfashion , the spotlit modern shop one floor down . Suddenly he stopped . " You do n't need to be afraid of me , you know . " He said it in a kindly , grownup voice . " I can see , you 're a properly brought up girl . I like that . It 's nice . " Sith still could n't find anything to say . She could only nod . She wanted to run away . " Would you like to go to K-Four ? " K-Four , the big electronics shop , stocked all the reliable brand names : Hitachi , Sony , Panasonic , Philips , or Denon . It was so expensive that almost nobody shopped there , which is why Sith liked it . A crowd of people stood outside and stared through the window at a huge home entertainment center showing a DVD of Ice Age . On the screen , a little animal was being chased by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to say . " If I had one of those , I would never need to leave the house . " Dara looked at her sideways and decided to laugh . The next day Sith told him that all the phones she had were too big . Did he have one that she could wear around her neck like jewelry ? This time they went to Lucky7 Burgers , and sat across from the Revlon counter . They watched boys having their hair layered by Revlon 's natural beauty specialists . Dara told her more about himself . His father had died in the wars . His family now lived in the country . Sith 's Coca-Cola suddenly tasted of antimalarial drugs . " But ... you do n't want to live in the country , " she said . " No . I have to live in Phnom Penh to make money . But my folks are good country people . Modest . " He smiled , embarrassed . They 'll have hens and a cousin who shimmies up coconut trees . There will be trees all around but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't finish her drink . She sighed and smiled and said abruptly , " I 'm sorry . It 's been cool . But I have to go . " She slunk sideways out of her seat as slowly as molasses . Walking back into the jewelry rotunda with nothing to do , she realized that Dara would think she did n't like him . And that made the lower part of her eyes sting . She went back the next day and did n't even pretend to buy a mobile phone . She told Dara that she 'd left so suddenly the day before because she 'd remembered a hair appointment . He said that he could see she took a lot of trouble with her hair . Then he asked her out for a movie that night . Sith spent all day shopping in K-Four . They met at six . Dara was so considerate that he did n't even suggest the horror movie . He said he wanted to see Buffalo Girl Hiding , a movie about a country girl who lives on a farm . Sith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie . The cinema on the top floor opened out directly onto the roof of Soriya . Graffiti had been scratched into the green railings . Why would people want to ruin something new and beautiful ? Sith put her arm through Dara 's and knew that they were now boyfriend and girlfriend . " Finally , " he said . " Finally what ? " " You 've done something . " They leaned on the railings and looked out over other people 's apartments . West toward the river was a building with one huge roof terrace . Women met there to gossip . Children were playing toss-the-sandal . From this distance , Sith was enchanted . " I just love watching the children . " The movie , from Thailand , was about a woman whose face turns blue and spotty and who eats men . The blue woman was yucky , but not as scary as all the badly dubbed voices . The characters sounded possessed . It was though Thai people had been taken over by the spirits of dead Cambodians . Whenever Sith got scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dara thought she was laughing at a dumb movie and found such intelligence charming . He started to chuckle too . Sith thought he was as frightened as she was . Together in the dark , they took each other 's hands . Outside afterward , the air hung hot even in the dark and 142nd Street smelled of drains . Sith stood on tiptoe to avoid the oily deposits and cast-off fishbones . Dara said , " I will drive you home . " " My driver can take us , " said Sith , flipping open her Kermit-the-Frog mobile . Her black Mercedes Benz edged to a halt , crunching old plastic bottles in the gutter . The seats were upholstered with tan leather and the driver was armed . Dara 's jaw dropped . " Who ... who is your father ? " " He 's dead . " Dara shook his head . " Who Was he ? " Normally Sith used her mother 's family name , but that would not answer this question . Flustered , she tried to think of someone who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . She remembered something about a politician who had died . His name came to her and she said it in panic . " My father was Kol Vireakboth . " Had she got the name right ? " Please do n't tell anyone . " Dara covered his eyes . " We - my family , my father - we fought for the KPLA . " Sith had to stop herself asking what the KPLA was . KoI Vireakboth had led a faction in the civil wars . It fought against the Khmer Rouge , the Vietnamese , the King , and corruption . It wanted a new way for Cambodia . Kol Vireakboth was a Cambodian leader who had never told a lie and or accepted a bribe . Remember that this is an untrue story . Dara started to back away from the car . " I do n't think we should be doing this . I 'm just a villager , really . " " That does n't matter . " His eyes closed . " I would expect nothing less from the daughter of Kol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked the man 's name out of the air , she did n't need more problems . " Please ! " she said . Dara sighed . " Okay . I said I would see you home safely . I will . " Inside the Mercedes , he stroked the tan leather . When they arrived , he craned his neck to look up at the building . " Which floor are you on ? " " All of them . " Color drained from his face . " My driver will take you back , " she said to Dara . As the car pulled away , she stood outside the closed garage shutters , waving forlornly . Then Sith panicked . Who was KoI Vireakboth ? She went online and Googled . She had to read about the wars . Her skin started to creep . All those different factions swam in her head : ANS , NADK , KPR , and KPNLF , The very names seemed to come at her spoken by forgotten voices . Soon she had all she could stand . She printed out Vireakboth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case Dara visited . KoI Vireakboth had a round face and a fatherly smile . His eyes seemed to slant upward toward his nose , looking full of kindly insight . He 'd been killed by a car bomb . All that night , Sith heard whispering . In the morning , there was another picture of someone else in the tray of her printer . A long-faced , buck-toothed woman stared out at her in black and white . Sith noted the victim 's fashion lapses . The woman 's hair was a mess , all frizzy . She should have had it straightened and put in some nice highlights . The woman 's eyes drilled into her . " Ca n't touch me , " said Sith . She left the photo in the tray . She went to see Dara , right away , no breakfast . His eyes were circled with dark flesh and his blue Hello trousers and shirt were not properly ironed . " Buy the whole shop , " Dara said , looking deranged . " The guys in K-Four just told me some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home theatres . One for the salon , she said , and one for the roof terrace . She paid for both of them in full and had them delivered to the far end of Monivong . " Sith sighed . " I 'm sending one back . " She hoped that sounded abstemious . " It looked too metallic against my curtains . " Pause . " She also bought an Aido robot dog for fifteen hundred dollars . " Sith would have preferred that Dara did not know about the dog . It was just a silly toy ; it had n't occured to her that it might cost that much until she saw the bill . " They should not tell everyone about their customers " business or soon they will have no customers . " Dara was looking at her as if thinking : This is not just a nice sweet girl . " I had fun last night , " Sith said in a voice as thin as high clouds . " So did I. " " We do n't have to tell anyone about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of losing him . " No . But Sith , it 's stupid . Your family , my family , we are not equals . " " It does n't make any difference . " " You lied to me . Your family is not dead . You have famous uncles . " She did indeed - Uncle Ieng Sary , Uncle Khieu Samphan , Uncle Ta Mok . All the Pol Pot clique had been called her uncles . " I did n't know them that well , " she said . That was true , too . What would she do if she could n't shop in Soriya Market anymore ? What would she do without Dara ? She begged . " I " am not a strong person . Sometimes I think I am not a person at all . I 'm just a space . " Dara looked suddenly mean . " You 're just a credit card . " Then his face fell . " I 'm sorry . That was an unkind thing to say . You are very young for your age and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more care . " Sith was desperate . " All my money would be very nice . " " I 'm not for sale . " He worked in a shop and would be sending money home to a fatherless family ; of course he was for sale ! Sith had a small heart , but a big head for thinking . She knew that she had to do this delicately , like picking a flower , or she would spoil the bloom . " Let 's ... let 's just go see a movie ? " After all , she was beautiful and well brought up and she knew her eyes were big and round . Her tiny heart was aching . This time they saw Turn Teav , a remake of an old movie from the 1960s . If movies were not nightmares about ghosts , then they tried to preserve the past . When , thought Sith , will they make a movie about Cambodia 's future ! Turn Teav was based on a classic tale of a young monk who falls in love with a properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They commit suicide at the end , bringing a curse on their village . Sith sat through it stony-faced . I am not going to be a dead heroine in a romance . Dara offered to drive her home again and that 's when Sith found out that he drove a Honda Dream . He proudly presented to her the gleaming motorcycle of fast young men . Sith felt backed into a comer . She 'd already offered to buy him . Showing off her car again might humiliate him . So she broke rule number seven . Dara hid her bag in the back and they went soaring down Monivong Boulevard at night , past homeless people , prostitutes , and chefs staggering home after work . It was late in the year , but it started to rain . Sith loved it , the cool air brushing against her face , the cooler rain clinging to her eyelashes . She remembered being five years old in the forest and dancing in the monsoon . She encircled Dara 's waist to stay on the bike and suddenly found her cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear , not of the rain , but of what she felt . He dropped her off at home . Inside , everything was dark except for the flickering green light on her printer . In the tray were two new photographs . One was of a child , a little boy , holding up a school prize certificate . The other was a tough , wise-looking old man , with a string of muscle down either side of his ironic , bitter smile . They looked directly at her . They know who I am . As she climbed the stairs to her bedroom , she heard someone sobbing , far away , as if the sound came from next door . She touched the walls of the staircase . They shivered slightly , constricting in time to the cries . In her bedroom she extracted one of her many iPods from the tangle of wires and listened to System of a Down , as loud as she could . It helped her sleep . The sound of nu-metal guitars seemed to come roaring out of her own heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of her doorbell many floors down . She heard the housekeeper Jorani call and the door open . Sith hesitated over choice of jeans and top . By the time she got downstairs she found the driver and the housemaid joking with Dara , giving him tea . Like the sunshine , Dara seemed to disperse ghosts . " Hi , " he said . " It 's my day off . I thought we could go on a motorcycle ride to the country . " But not to the country . Could n't they just spend the day in Soriya ? No , said Dara , there 's lots of other places to see in Phnom Penh . He drove her , twisting through back streets . How did the city get so poor ? How did it get so dirty ? They went to a new and modern shop for CDs that was run by a record label . Dara knew all the cool new music , most of it influenced by Khmer-Americans returning from Long Beach and Compton : Sdey , Phnom Penh Bad Boys , Khmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Museum and saw the beautiful Buddhalike head of King Jayavarman VII . Dara without thinking ducked and held up his hands in prayer . They had dinner in a French restaurant with candles and wine , and it was just like in a karaoke video , a boy , a girl , and her money all going out together . They saw the show at Sovanna Phum , and there was a wonderful dance piece with sampled 1940s music from an old French movie , with traditional Khmer choreography . Sith went home , her heart singing , Dara , Dara , Dara . In the bedroom , a mobile phone began to ring , over and over . Call 1 said the screen , but gave no name or number , so the person was not on Sith 's list of contacts . She turned off the phone . It kept ringing . That 's when she knew for certain . She hid the phone in a pillow in the spare bedroom and put another pillow on top of it and then closed the door . All forty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from inside closets , or from the bathroom where she had forgotten them . They rang from the roof terrace and even from inside a shoe under her bed . " I am a very stubborn girl ! " she shouted at the spirits . " You do not scare me . " She turned up her iPod and finally slept . As soon as the sun was up , she roused her driver , slumped deep in his hammock . " Come on , we 're going to Soriya Market , " she said . The driver looked up at her dazed , then remembered to smile and lower his head in respect . His face fell when she showed up in the garage with all forty-two of her mobile phones in one black bag . It was too early for Soriya Market to open . They drove in circles with sunrise blazing directly into their eyes . On the streets , men pushed carts like beasts of burden , or carried cascades of belts into the old Central Market . The old market was domed , art deco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " Maybe you should go visit your Mom , " said the driver . " You know , she loves you . Families are there for when you are in trouble . " Sith 's mother lived in Thailand and they never spoke . Her mother 's family kept asking for favors : money , introductions , or help with getting a job . Sith did n't speak to them any longer . " My family is only trouble . " The driver shut up and drove . Finally Soriya opened . Sith went straight to Dara 's shop and dumped all the phones on the blue countertop . " Can you take these back ? " " We only do exchanges . I can give a new phone for an old one . " Dara looked thoughtful . " Do n't worry . Leave them here with me , I 'll go sell them to a guy in the old market , and give you your money tomorrow . " He smiled in approval . " This is very sensible . " He passed one phone back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best one , keep this . " Dara was so competent . Sith wanted to sink down onto him like a pillow and stay there . She sat in the shop all day , watching him work . One of the guys from the games shop upstairs asked , " Who is this beautiful girl ? " Dara answered proudly , " My girlfriend . " Dara drove her back on the Dream and at the door to her house , he chuckled . " I do n't want to go . " She pressed a finger against his naughty lips , and smiled and spun back inside from happiness . She was in the ground-floor garage . She heard something like a rat scuttle . In her bag , the telephone rang . Who were these people to importune her , even if they were dead ? She wrenched the mobile phone out of her bag and pushed the green button and put the phone to her ear . She waited . There was a sound like wind . A child spoke to her , his voice clogged as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . " Sith demanded . " How did you get my number ? " " I 'm all alone ! " " Then ring somebody else . Someone in your family . " " All my family are dead . I do n't know where I am . My name is .... " Sith clicked the phone off . She opened the trunk of the car and tossed the phone inside it . Being telephoned by ghosts was so .. . unmodem . How could Cambodia become a number one country if its cell phone network was haunted ? She stormed up into the salon . On top of a table , the $1500 , no-mess dog stared at her from out of his packaging . Sith clumped up the stairs onto the roof terrace to sleep as far away as she could from everything in the house . She woke up in the dark , to hear thumping from downstairs . The sound was metallic and hollow , as if someone were locked in the car . Sith turned on her iPod . Something was making the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wrenched out another player , a Xen , but it too skipped , burping the sound of speaking voices into the middle of the music . Had she heard a ripping sound ? She pulled out the earphones , and heard something climbing the stairs . A sound of light , uneven lolloping . She thought of crippled children . Frost settled over her like a heavy blanket and she could not move . The robot dog came whirring up onto the terrace . It paused at the top of the stairs , its camera nose pointing at her to see , its useless eyes glowing cherry red . The robot dog said in a warm , friendly voice , " My name is Phalla . I tried to buy my sister medicine and they killed me for it . " Sith tried to say , " Go away , " but her throat would n't open . The dog tilted its head . " No one even knows I 'm dead . What will you do for all the people who are not mourned ? " Laughter blurted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cold vapor into the air . " We have no one to invite us to the feast , " said the dog . Sith giggled in terror . " Nothing . I can do nothing ! " she said , shaking her head . " You laugh ? " The dog gathered itself and jumped up into the hammock with her . It turned and lifted up its clear plastic tail and laid a genuine turd alongside Sith . Short brown hair was wound up in it , a scalp actually , and a single flat white human tooth smiled out of it . Sith squawked and overturned both herself and the dog out of the hammock and onto the floor . The dog pushed its nose up against hers and began to sing an old-fashioned children 's song about birds . Something heavy huffed its way up the stairwell toward her . Sith shivered with cold on the floor and could not move . The dog went on singing in a high , sweet voice . A large shadow loomed out over the top of the staircase , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was thumping in the car and no one in it , " said the driver . Sith sagged toward the floor with relief . " The ghosts , " she said . " They 're back . " She thrust herself to her feet . " We 're getting out now . Ring the Hilton . Find out if they have rooms . " She kicked the toy dog down the stairs ahead of her . " We 're moving now ! " Together they all loaded the car , shaking . Once again , the house was left to ghosts . As they drove , the mobile phone rang over and over inside the trunk . The new Hilton ( which does not exist ) rose up by the river across from the Department for Cults and Religious Affairs . Tall and marbled and pristine , it had crystal chandeliers and fountains , and wood and brass handles in the elevators . In the middle of the night only the Bridal Suite was still available , but it had an extra parental chamber where the driver and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night sparkled with lights and everything was hushed , as far away from Cambodia as it was possible to get . Things were quiet after that , for a while . Every day she and Dara went to movies , or went to a restaurant . They went shopping . She slipped him money and he bought himself a beautiful suit . He said , over a hamburger at Lucky7 , " I 've told my mother that I 've met a girl . " Sith smiled and thought : and I bet you told her that I 'm rich . " I 've decided to live in the Hilton , " she told him . Maybe we could live in the Hilton . A pretty smile could hint at that . The rainy season ended . The last of the monsoons rose up dark gray with a froth of white cloud on top , looking exactly like a giant wave about to break . Dry cooler air arrived . After work was over Dara convinced her to go for a walk along the river in front of the Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change into a new luxury suit and Sith thought : he 's beginning to imagine life with all that money . As they walked along the river , exposed to all those people , Sith shook inside . There were teenage boys everywhere . Some of them were in rags , which was reassuring , but some of them were very well dressed indeed , the sons of Impunity who could do anything . Sith swerved suddenly to avoid even seeing them . But Dara in his new beige suit looked like one of them , and the generals " sons nodded to him with quizzical eyebrows , perhaps wondering who he was . In front of the palace , a pavilion reached out over the water . Next to it a traditional orchestra bashed and wailed out something old fashioned . Hundreds of people crowded around a tiny wat . Dara shook Sith 's wrist and they stood up to see . People held up bundles of lotus flowers and incense in prayer . They threw the bundles into the wat . Monks immediately shoveled the joss sticks and flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing T-shirts and shorts black with filth rootled through the dead flowers , the smoldering incense , and old coconut shells . Sith asked , " Why do they do that ? " " You are so innocent ! " chuckled Dara and shook his head . The evening was blue and gold . Sith had time to think that she did not want to go back to a hotel and that the only place she really felt happy was next to Dara . All around that thought was something dark and tangled . Dara suggested with affection that they should get married . It was as if Sith had her answer ready . " No , absolutely not , " she said at once . " How can you ask that ? There is not even anyone for you to ask ! Have you spoken to your family about me ? Has your family made any checks about my background ? " Which was what she really wanted to know . Dara shook his head . " I have explained that you are an orphan , but they are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be happy if I am happy . " " Of course they wo n't be ! Of course they will need to do checks . " Sith scowled . She saw her way to sudden advantage . " At least they must consult fortunetellers . They are not fools . I can help them . Ask them the names of the fortunetellers they trust . " Dara smiled shyly . " We have no money . " " I will give them money and you can tell them that you pay . " Dara 's eyes searched her face . " I do n't want that . " " How will we know if it is a good marriage ? And your poor mother , how can you ask her to make a decision like this without information ? So . You ask your family for the names of good professionals they trust , and I will pay them , and I will go to Prime Minister Hun Sen 's own personal fortuneteller , and we can compare results . " Thus she established again both her propriety and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not approve of the match and the fortuneteller would say that the marriage was ill-omened . Sith left nothing to romance . She offered the family 's fortunetellers whatever they wanted - a car , a farm - and in return demanded a written copy of their judgment . All of them agreed that the portents for the marriage were especially auspicious . Then she secured an appointment with the Prime Minister 's fortune-teller . Hun Sen 's Km Taey was a lady in a black business suit . She had long fingernails like talons , but they were perfectly manicured and frosted white . She was the kind of fortuneteller who is possessed by someone else 's spirit . She sat at a desk and looked at Sith as unblinking as a fish , both her hands steepled together . After the most basic of hellos , she said . " Dollars only . Twenty-five thousand . I need to buy my son an apartment . " " That 's a very high fee , " said Sith . " It 's not a fee . It is a consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another twenty-five thousand dollars . " They negotiated . Sith liked the Kru Taey 's manner . It confirmed everything Sith believed about life . The fee was reduced somewhat but not the consideration . " Payment upfront now , " the Kru Taey said . She would n't take a check . Like only the very best restaurants she accepted foreign credit cards . Sith 's Swiss card worked immediately . It had unlimited credit in case she had to leave the country in a hurry . The Kru Taey said , " I will tell the boy 's family that the marriage will be particularly fortunate . " Sith realized that she had not yet said anything about a boy , his family , or a marriage . The Kru Taey smiled . " I know you are not interested in your real fortune . But to be kind , I will tell you unpaid that this marriage really is particularly well favored . All the other fortunetellers would have said the same thing without being bribed . " The Kru Taey 's eyes glinted in the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them farms or paid me an extra twenty-five thousand dollars . " She looked down at her perfect fingernails . " You will be very happy indeed . But not before your entire life is overturned . " The back of Sith 's arms prickled as if from cold . She should have been angry but she could feel herself smiling . Why ? And why waste politeness on the old witch ? Sith turned to go without saying good-bye . " Oh , and about your other problem , " said the woman . Sith turned back and waited . " Enemies , " said the Kru Taey , " can turn out to be friends . " Sith sighed . " What are you talking about ? " The Kru Taey 's smile was a wide as a tiger-trap . " The million people your father killed . " Sith went hard . " Not a million , " she said . " Somewhere between two hundred and fifty and five hundred thousand . " " Enough , " smiled the Kru Taey . " My father was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I will be sure to tell the Prime Minister that you visited me . " Sith snorted as if in scorn . " I will tell him myself . " But she ran back to her car . That night , Sith looked down on all the lights like diamonds . She settled onto the giant mattress and turned on her iPod . Someone started to yell at her . She pulled out the earpieces and jumped to the window . It would n't open . She shook it and wrenched its frame until it reluctantly slid an inch and she threw the iPod out of the twenty-first-floor window . She woke up late the next morning , to hear the sound of the TV . She opened up the double doors into the salon and saw Jorani , pressed against the wall . " The TV ... , " Jorani said , her eyes wide with terror . The driver waited by his packed bags . He stood up , looking as mournful as a bloodhound . On the widescreen TV there was what looked like a pop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old fashioned . Why would a pop video show a starving man eating raw maize in a field ? He glanced over his shoulder in terror as he ate . The glowing singalong words were the song that the dog had sung at the top of the stairs . The starving man looked up at Sith and corn mash rolled out of his mouth . " It 's all like that , " said the driver . " I unplugged the set , but it kept playing on every channel . " He sompiahed but looked miserable . " My wife wants to leave . " Sith felt shame . It was miserable and dirty , being infested with ghosts . Of course they would want to go . " It 's okay . I can take taxis , " she said . The driver nodded , and went into the next room and whispered to his wife . With little scurrying sounds , they gathered up their things . They sompiahed , and apologized . The door clicked almost silently behind them . It will always be like this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this with Dara . The hotel telephone started to ring . Sith left it ringing . She covered the TV with a blanket , but the terrible , tinny old music kept wheedling and rattling its way out at her , and she sat on the edge of her bed , staring into space . I 'll have to leave Cambodia . At the market , Dara looked even more cheerful than usual . The fortunetellers had pronounced the marriage as very favorable . His mother had invited Sith home for the Pchum Ben festival . " We can take the bus tomorrow , " he said . " Does it smell ? All those people in one place ? " " It smells of air freshener . Then we take a taxi , and then you will have to walk up the track . " Dara suddenly doubled up in laughter . " Oh , it will be good for you . " " Will there be dirt ? " " Everywhere ! Oh , your dirty Nikes will earn you much merit ! " But at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two days later , Sith was walking down a dirt track , ducking tree branches . Dust billowed all over her shoes . Dara walked behind her , chuckling , which meant she thought he was scared too . She heard a strange rattling sound . " What 's that noise ? " " It 's a goat , " he said . " My mother bought it for me in April as a present . " A goat . How could they be any more rural ? Sith had never seen a goat . She never even imagined that she would . Dara explained . " I sell them to the Muslims . It is Agricultural Diversification . " There were trees everywhere , shadows crawling across the ground like snakes . Sith felt sick . One mosquito , she promised herself , just one and I will squeal and run away . The house was tiny , on thin twisting stilts . She had pictured a big fine country house standing high over the ground on concrete pillars with a sunburst carving in the gable . The kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no stilts , and it was made of palm-leaf panels and there was no electricity . The strip light in the ceiling was attached to a car battery and they kept a live fire on top of the concrete table to cook . Everything smelled of burnt fish . Sith loved it . Inside the hut , the smoke from the fires kept the mosquitoes away . Dara 's mother , Mrs. Non Kunthea , greeted her with a smile . That triggered a respectful sompiah from Sith , the prayer-like gesture leaping out of her unbidden . On the platform table was a plastic sack full of dried prawns . Without thinking , Sith sat on the table and began to pull the salty prawns out of their shells . Why am I doing this ? Because it 's what I did at home . Sith suddenly remembered the enclosure in the forest , a circular fenced area . Daddy had slept in one house , and the women in another . Sith would talk to the cooks . For something to do , she would chop vegetables or shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd sit on the platform table and she , little Sith , would sit between his knees . Dara 's older brother Yuth came back for lunch . He was pot-bellied and drove a taxi for a living , and he moved in hard jabs like an angry old man . He reached too far for the rice and Sith could smell his armpits . " You see how we live , " Yuth said to Sith . " This is what we get for having the wrong patron . Sihanouk thought we were anti-monarchist . To Hun Sen , we were the enemy . Remember the Work for Money program ? " No . " They did n't give any of those jobs to us . We might as well have been the Khmer Rouge ! " The past , thought Sith , why do n't they just let it go ? Why do they keep boasting about their old wars ? Mrs. Non Kunthea chuckled with affection . " My eldest son was born angry , " she said . " His slogan is " ten years is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " They treat that old monster Pol Pot better than they treat us . But then , he was an important person . If you go to his stupa in Anlong Veng , you will see that people leave offerings ! They ask him for lottery numbers ! " He crumpled his green , soft , old-fashioned hat back onto his head and said , " Nice to meet you , Sith . Dara , she 's too high class for the likes of you . " But he grinned as he said it . He left , swirling disruption in his wake . The dishes were gathered . Again without thinking , Sith swept up the plastic tub and carried it to the blackened branches . They rested over puddles where the washing-up water drained . " You should n't work , " said Dara 's mother . " You are a guest . " " I grew up in a refugee camp , " said Sith . After all , it was true . Dara looked at her with a mix of love , pride , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works . And that was the best Sith could hope for . This family would be fine for her . In the late afternoon , all four brothers came with their wives for the end of Pchum Ben , when the ghosts of the dead can wander the Earth . People scatter rice on the temple floors to feed their families . Some ghosts have small mouths so special rice is used . Sith never took part in Pchum Ben . How could she go the temple and scatter rice for Pol Pot ? The family settled in the kitchen chatting and joking , and it all passed in a blur for Sith . Everyone else had family they could honor . To Sith 's surprise one of the uncles suggested that people should write names of the deceased and burn them , to transfer merit . It was nothing to do with Pchum Ben , but a lovely idea , so all the family wrote down names . Sith sat with her hands jammed under her arms . Dara 's mother asked , " Is n't there a name you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Sith in a tiny voice . How could she write the name Pol Pot ? He was surely roaming the world let loose from hell . " There is no one . " Dara rubbed her hand . " Yes there is , Sith . A very special name . " " No , there 's not . " Dara thought she did n't want them to know her father was Kol Vireakboth . He leant forward and whispered . " I promise . No one will see it . " Sith 's breath shook . She took the paper and started to cry . " Oh , " said Dara 's mother , stricken with sympathy . " Everyone in this country has a tragedy . " Sith wrote the name Kol Vireakboth . Dara kept the paper folded and caught Sith 's eyes . You see ? he seemed to say . I have kept your secret safe . The paper burned . Thunder slapped a clear sky about the face . It had been sunny , but now as suddenly as a curtain dropped down over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere , tearing away a flap of palm-leaf wall , as if forcing entrance in a fury . The family whooped and laughed and let the rain drench their shoulders as they stood up to push the wall back down , to keep out the rain . But Sith knew . Her father 's enemy was in the kitchen . The rain passed ; the sun came out . The family chuckled and sat back down around or on the table . They lowered dishes of food and ate , making parcels of rice and fish with their fingers . Sith sat rigidly erect , waiting for misfortune . What would the spirit of Kol Vireakboth do to Pol Pot 's daughter ? Would he overturn the table , soiling her with food ? Would he send mosquitoes to bite and make her sick ? Would he suck away all her good fortune , leaving the marriage blighted , her new family estranged ? Or would a kindly spirit simply wish that the children of all Cambodians could escape , escape the past ? Suddenly , Sith felt at peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses started to work in magic ways . She smelled a perfume of emotion , sweet and bracing at the same time . The music from a neighbor 's cassette player touched her arm gently . Words took the form of sunlight on her skin . No one is evil , the sunlight said . But they can be false . False , how ? Sith asked without speaking , genuinely baffled . The sunlight smiled with an old man 's stained teeth . You know very well how . All the air swelled with the scent of the food , savoring it . The trees sighed with satisfaction . Life is true . Sith saw steam from the rice curl up into the branches . Death is false . The sunlight stood up to go . It whispered . Tell him . The world faded back to its old self . That night in a hammock in a room with the other women , Sith suddenly sat bolt upright . Clarity would not let her sleep . She saw that there was no way ahead . She could n't marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was harassed by one million dead ? How could she explain I am haunted because I am Pol Pot 's daughter and I have lied about everything ? The dead would not let her marry ; the dead would not let her have joy . So who could Pol Pot 's daughter pray to ? Where could she go for wisdom ? Look kru Kol Vizeakboth , she said under her breath . Please show me a way ahead . The darkness was sterner than the sunlight . To be as false as you are , it said , you first have to lie to yourself . What lies had Sith told ? She knew the facts . Her father had been the head of a government that tortured and killed hundreds of thousands of people and starved the nation through mismanagement . I know the truth . I just never think about it . I 've never faced it . Well , the truth is as dark as I am , and you live in me , the darkness . She had read books - well , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fingers were scalded . There was no truth for her in books . The truth ahead of her would be loneliness , dreary adulthood , and penance . Grow up . The palm-leaf panels stirred like waiting ghosts . All through the long bus ride back , she said nothing . Dara went silent too , and hung his head . In the huge and empty hotel suite , darkness awaited her . She 'd had the phone and the TV removed ; her footsteps sounded hollow . Jorani and the driver had been her only friends . The next day she did not go to Soriya Market . She went instead to the torture museum of Tuol Sleng . A cadre of young motoboys waited outside the hotel in baseball caps and bling . Instead , Sith hailed a sweet-faced older motoboy with a battered , rusty bike . As they drove she asked him about his family . He lived alone and had no one except for his mother in Kompong Thom . Outside the gates of Tuol Sleng he said , " This was my old school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one iron bed in each with handcuffs and stains on the floor . Photos on the wall showed twisted bodies chained to those same beds as they were found on the day of liberation . In one photograph , a chair was overturned as if in a hurry . Sith stepped outside and looked instead at a beautiful house over the wall across the street . It was a high white house like her own , with pillars and a roof terrace and bougainvillaea , a modern daughter 's house . What do they think when they look out from that roof terrace ? How can they live here ? The grass was tended and full of hopping birds . People were painting the shutters of the prison a fresh blue-gray . In the middle wing , the rooms were galleries of photographed faces . They stared out at her like the faces from her printer . Were some of them the same ? " Who are they ? " she found herself asking a Cambodian visitor . " Their own , " the woman replied . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of favor . They would not waste such torture on ordinary Cambodians . " Some of the faces were young and beautiful men . Some were children or dignified old women . The Cambodian lady kept pace with her . Company ? Did she guess who Sith was ? " They could n't simply beat party cadres to death . They sent them and their entire families here . The children too , the grandmothers . They had different days of the week for killing children and wives . " An innocent looking man smiled out at the camera as sweetly as her aged motoboy , directly into the camera of his torturers . He seemed to expect kindness from them , and decency . Comrades , he seemed to say . The face in the photograph moved . It smiled more broadly and was about to speak . Sith eyes darted away . The next face sucked all her breath away . It was not a stranger . It was Dara , her Dara , in black shirt and black cap . She gasped and looked back at the lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was she a ghost too ? Sith reeled outside and hid her face and did n't know if she could go on standing . Tears slid down her face and she wanted to be sick and she turned her back so no one could see . Then she walked to the motoboy , sitting in a shelter . In complete silence , she got on his bike feeling angry at the place , angry at the government for preserving it , angry at the foreigners who visited it like a tourist attraction , angry at everything . That is not who we are ! That is not what I am ! The motoboy slipped onto his bike , and Sith asked him : What happened to your family ? It was a cruel question . He had to smile and look cheerful . His father had run a small shop ; they went out into the country and never came back . He lived with his brother in a jeum-room , a refugee camp in Thailand . They came back to fight the Vietnamese and his brother was killed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the Hilton , but she felt ashamed . Of what ? Just how far was she going to run ? She asked him to take her to the old house on Monivong Boulevard . As the motorcycle wove through back streets , dodging red-earth ruts and pedestrians , she felt rage at her father . How dare he involve her in something like that ! Sith had lived a small life and had no measure of things so she thought : it 's as if someone tinted my hair and it all fell out . It 's as if someone pierced my ears and they got infected and my whole ear rotted away . She remembered that she had never felt any compassion for her father . She had been twelve years old when he stood trial , old and sick and making such a show of leaning on his stick . Everything he did was a show . She remembered rolling her eyes in constant embarrassment . Oh , he was fine in front of rooms full of adoring students . He could play the bong thorn with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , using his false , soft and kindly little voice , as if he was dubbed . He had made Sith recite Verlaine , Rimbaud , and Rilke . He killed thousands for having foreign influences . I do n't know what I did in a previous life to deserve you for a father . But you were not my father in a previous life and you wo n't be my father in the next . I reject you utterly . I will never burn your name . You can wander hungry out of hell every year for all eternity . I will pray to keep you in hell . I am not your daughter ! If you were false , I have , to be true . Her old house looked abandoned in the stark afternoon light , closed and innocent . At the doorstep she turned and thrust a fistful of dollars into the motoboy 's hand . She could n't think straight ; she could n't even see straight , her vision blurred . Back inside , she calmly put down her teddy-bear rucksack and walked upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way toward her . She had broken his back leg kicking him downstairs . He limped , whimpering like a dog , and lowered his head to have it stroked . To her relief , there was only one picture waiting for her in the tray of the printer . Kol Vireakboth looked out at her , middle-aged , handsome , worn , wise . Pity and kindness glowed in his eyes . The land line began to ring . " Youl prom , " she told the ghosts . Agreed . She picked up the receiver and waited . A man spoke . " My name was Yin Bora . " His voice bubbled up brokenly as if from underwater . A light blinked in the printer . A photograph slid out quickly . A young student stared out at her looking happy at a family feast . He had a Beatle haircut and a striped shirt . " That 's me , " said the voice on the phone . " I played football . " Sith coughed . " What do you want me to do ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Please hold the line , " said Sith , in a hypnotized voice . She fumbled for a pen , and then wrote on the photograph Yin Bora , footballer . He looked so sweet and happy . " You have no one to mourn you , " she realized . " None of us have anyone left alive to mourn us , " said the ghost . Then there was a terrible sound down the telephone , as if a thousand voices moaned at once . Sith involuntarily dropped the receiver into place . She listened to her heart thump and thought about what was needed . She fed the printer with the last of her paper . Immediately it began to roll out more photos , and the land line rang again . She went outside and found the motoboy , waiting patiently for her . She asked him to go and buy two reams of copying paper . At the last moment she added pens and writing paper and matches . He bowed and smiled and bowed again , pleased to have found a patron . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand picked up the phone . For the next half hour , she talked to the dead , and found photographs and wrote down names . A woman mourned her children . Sith found photos of them all , and united them , father , mother , three children , uncles , aunts , cousins and grandparents , taping their pictures to her wall . The idea of uniting families appealed . She began to stick the other photos onto her wall . Someone called from outside and there on her doorstep was the motoboy , balancing paper and pens . " I bought you some soup . " The broth came in neatly tied bags and was full of rice and prawns . She thanked him and paid him well and he beamed at her and bowed again and again . All afternoon , the pictures kept coming . Darkness fell , the phone rang , the names were written , until Sith 's hand , which was unused to writing anything , ached . The doorbell rang , and on the doorstep , the motoboy sompiahed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am worried for you . Can I get you dinner ? " Sith had to smile . He sounded motherly in his concern . They are so good at building a relationship with you , until you can not do without them . In the old days she would have sent him away with a few rude words . Now she sent him away with an order . And wrote . And when he came back , the aged motoboy looked so happy . " I bought you fruit as well , Lady , " he said , and added , shyly . " You do not need to pay me for that . " Something seemed to bump under Sith , as if she was on a motorcycle , and she heard herself say , " Come inside . Have some food too . " The motoboy sompiahed in gratitude and as soon as he entered , the phone stopped ringing . They sat on the floor . He arched his neck and looked around at the walls . " Are all these people your family ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghosts who no one mourns . " " Why do they come to you ? " His mouth fell open in wonder . " Because my father was Pol Pot , " said Sith , without thinking . The motoboy sompiahed . " Ah . " He chewed and swallowed and arched his head back again . " That must be a terrible thing . Everybody hates you . " Sith had noticed that wherever she sat in the room , the eyes in the photographs were directly on her . " I have n't done anything , " said Sith . " You 're doing something now , " said the motoboy . He nodded and stood up , sighing with satisfaction . Life was good with a full stomach and a patron . " If you need me , Lady , I will be outside . " Photo after photo , name after name . Youk Achariya : touring dancer Proeung Chhay : school superintendent Sar Kothida child , aged 7 , died of " swelling disease " Sar Makara , her mother , nurse Nath Mittapheap , civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of award-winning engineer Yin Sokunthea : Khmer Rouge commune leader She looked at the faces and realized . Dara , I 'm doing this for Dara . The City around her went quiet and she became aware that it was now very late indeed . Perhaps she should just make sure the motoboy had gone home . He was still waiting outside . " It 's okay . You can go home . Where do you live ? " He waved cheerfully north . " Oh , on Monivong , like you . " He grinned at the absurdity of the comparison . A new idea took sudden form . Sith said , " Tomorrow , can you come early , with a big feast ? Fish and rice and greens and pork : curries and stirfries and kebabs . " She paid him handsomely , and finally asked him his name . His name meant Golden . " Good night , Sovann . " For the rest of the night she worked quickly like an answering service . This is like a cleaning of the house before a festival , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , familiar . Why are people afraid of the dead ? The dead ca n't hurt you . The dead want what you want : justice . The wall of faces became a staircase and a garage and a kitchen of faces , all named . She had found Jorani 's colored yarn , and linked family members into trees . She wrote until the electric lights looked discolored , like a headache . She asked the ghosts , " Please can I sleep now ? " The phones fell silent and Sith slumped with relief onto the polished marble floor . She woke up dazed , still on the marble floor . Sunlight flooded the room . The faces in the photographs no longer looked swollen and bruised . Their faces were not accusing or mournful . They smiled down on her . She was among friends . With a whine , the printer started to print ; the phone started to ring . Her doorbell chimed , and there was Sovann , white cardboard boxes piled up on the back of his motorcycle . He wore the same shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A seam had parted under the arm . He only has one shirt , Sith realized . She imagined him washing it in a basin every night . Sith and Sovann moved the big tables to the front windows . Sith took out her expensive tablecloths for the first time , and the bronze platters . The feast was laid out as if at New Year . Sovann had bought more paper and pens . He knew what they were for . " I can help , Lady . " He was old enough to have lived in a country with schools , and he could write in a beautiful , old-fashioned hand . Together he and Sith spelled out the names of the dead and burned them . " I want to write the names of my family too , " he said . He burnt them weeping . The delicious vapors rose . The air was full of the sound of breathing in . Loose papers stirred with the breeze . The ash filled the basins , but even after working all day , Sith and the motoboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sovann , " she told him . " You have transferred a lot of merit , " said Sovann , but only to be polite . If I have any merit to transfer , thought Sith . He left and the printers started , and the phone . She worked all night , and only stopped because the second ream of paper ran out . The last picture printed was of Kol Vireakboth . Dara , she promised herself . Dara next . In the morning , she called him . " Can we meet at lunchtime for another walk by the river ? " Sith waited on top of the marble wall and watched an old man fish in the Tonl Sap river and found that she loved her country . She loved its tough , smiling , uncomplaining people , who had never offered her harm , after all the harm her family had done them . Do you know you have the daughter of the monster sitting here among you ? Suddenly all Sith wanted was to be one of them . The monks in the pavilion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangling their legs , the young men who dress like American rappers and sold something dubious , drugs , or sex . She saw Dara sauntering toward her . He wore his new shirt , and smiled at her but he did n't look relaxed . It had been two days since they 'd met . He knew something was wrong , that she had something to tell him . He had bought them lunch in a little cardboard box . Maybe for the last time , thought Sith . They exchanged greetings , almost like cousins . He sat next to her and smiled and Sith giggled in terror at what she was about to do . Dara asked , " What 's funny ? " She could n't stop giggling . " Nothing is funny . Nothing . " She sighed in order to stop and terror tickled her and she spurted out laughter again . " I lied to you . Kol Vireakboth is not my father . Another politician was my father . Someone you 've heard of .... " The whole thing was so terrifying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could n't talk . She laughed and wept at the same time . Dara stared . " My father was Saloth Sar . That was his real name . " She could n't make herself say it . She could tell a motoboy , but not Dara ? She forced herself onward . " My father was Pol Pot . " Nothing happened . Sitting next to her , Dara went completely still . People strolled past ; boats bobbed on their moorings . After a time Dara said , " I know what you are doing . " That did n't make sense . " Doing ? What do you mean ? " Dara looked sour and angry . " Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . " He sat , looking away from her . Sith 's laughter had finally shuddered to a halt . She sat peering at him , waiting . " I told you my family were modest , " he said quietly . " Your family are lovely ! " Sith exclaimed . His jaw thrust out . " They had questions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand . " He rolled his eyes . He looked back " round at her . " There are easier ways to break up with someone . " He jerked himself to his feet and strode away with swift determination , leaving her sitting on the wall . Here on the riverfront , everyone was equal . The teenage boys lounged on the wall ; poor mothers herded children ; the foreigners walked briskly , trying to look as if they did n't carry moneybelts . Three fat teenage girls nearly swerved into a cripple in a pedal chair and collapsed against each other with raucous laughter . Sith did not know what to do . She could not move . Despair humbled her , made her hang her head . I 've lost him . The sunlight seemed to settle next to her , washing up from its reflection on the wake of some passing boat . No you have n't . The river water smelled of kindly concern . The sounds of traffic throbbed with forbearance . Not yet . There is no forgiveness in Cambodia . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciated for just a moment the miracles . The motoboy buying her soup . She decided to trust herself to the miracles . Sith talked to the sunlight without making a sound . Grandfather Vireakboth . Thank you . You have told me all I need to know . Sith stood up and from nowhere , the motoboy was there . He drove her to the Hello Phone shop . Dara would not look at her . He bustled back and forth behind the counter , though there was nothing for him to do . Sith talked to him like a customer . " I want to buy a mobile phone , " she said , but he would not answer . " There is someone I need to talk to . " Another customer came in . She was a beautiful daughter too , and he served her , making a great show of being polite . He complimented her on her appearance . " Really , you look cool . " The girl looked pleased . Dara 's eyes darted in Sith 's direction . Sith waited in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignored her . She picked up her phone and dialed his number . He put it to his ear and said , " Go home . " " You are my home , " she said . His thumb jabbed the C button . She waited . Shadows lengthened . " We 're closing , " he said , standing by the door without looking at her . Shamefaced , Sith ducked away from him , through the door . Outside Soriya , the motoboy played dice with his fellows . He stood up . " They say I am very lucky to have Pol Pot 's daughter as a client . " There was no discretion in Cambodia , either . Everyone will know now , Sith realized . At home , the piles of printed paper still waited for her . Sith ate the old , cold food . It tasted flat , all its savor sucked away . The phones began to ring . She fell asleep with the receiver propped against her ear . The next day , Sith went back to Soriya with a box of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue plastic counter of Hello Phones . " Because I am Pol Pot 's daughter , " she told Dara , holding out a sheaf of pictures toward him . " All the unmourned victims of my father are printing their pictures on my printer . Here . Look . These are the pictures of people who lost so many loved ones there is no one to remember them . " She found her cheeks were shaking and that she could not hold the sheaf of paper . It tumbled from her hands , but she stood back , arms folded . Data , quiet and solemn , knelt and picked up the papers . He looked at some of the faces . Sith pushed a softly crumpled green card at him . Her family ID card . He read it . Carefully , with the greatest respect , he put the photographs on the countertop along with the ID card . " Go home , Sith , " he said , but not unkindly . " I said , " she had begun to speak with vehemence but could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you are . " " I believe you , " he said , looking at his feet . " Then .... " Sith had no words . " It can never be , Sith , " he said . He gathered up the sheaf of photocopying paper . " What will you do with these ? " Something made her say , " What will you do with them ? " His face was crossed with puzzlement . " It 's your country too . What will you do with them ? Oh , I know , you 're such a poor boy from a poor family , who could expect anything from you ? Well , you have your whole family and many people have no one . And you can buy new shirts and some people only have one . " Dara held out both hands and laughed . " Sith ? " You , Sith are accusing me of being selfish ? " You own them too . " Sith pointed to the papers , to the faces . " You think the dead do n't try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latched . She told him what he could do . " I think you should make an exhibition . I think Hello Phones should sponsor it . You tell them that . You tell them Pol Pot 's daughter wishes to make amends and has chosen them . Tell them the dead speak to me on their mobile phones . " She spun on her heel and walked out . She left the photographs with him . That night she and the motoboy had another feast and burned the last of the unmourned names . There were many thousands . The next day she went back to Hello Phones . " I lied about something else , " she told Dara . She took out all the reports from the fortunetellers . She told him what Hun Sen 's fortuneteller had told her . " The marriage is particularly well favored . " " Is that true ? " He looked wistful . " You should not believe anything I say . Not until I have earned your trust . Go consult the fortunetellers for yourself . This time you pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere far beneath the floor . Then he looked up , directly into her eyes . " I will do that . " For the first time in her life Sith wanted to laugh for something other than fear . She wanted to laugh for joy . " Can we go to lunch at Lucky7 ? " she asked . " Sure , " he said . All the telephones in the shop , all of them , hundreds all at once began to sing . A waterfall of trills and warbles and buzzes , snatches of old songs or latest chart hits . Dara stood dumbfounded . Finally he picked one up and held it to his ear . " It 's for you , " he said and held out the phone for her . There was no name or number on the screen . Congratulations , dear daughter , said a warm kind voice . " Who is this ? " Sith asked . The options were severely limited . Your new father , said Kol Vireakboth . The sound of wind . I adopt you . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . IN CAMBODIA , you share your house with ghosts in the way you share it with dust . You hear the dead shuffling alongside your own footsteps . You can sweep , but the sound does not go away . On the Tra Bek end of Monivong there is a house whose owner has given it over to ghosts . You can try to close the front door . But the next day you will find it hanging open . Indeed you can try , as the neighbors did , to nail the door shut . It opens again . By day , there is always a queue of five or six people wanting to go in , or hanging back , out of fear . Outside are offerings of lotus or coconuts with embedded josh sticks . The walls and floors and ceilings are covered with photographs . The salon , the kitchen , the stairs , the office , the empty bedrooms , are covered with photographs of Chinese-Khmers at weddings , Khmer civil servants on picnics , Chams outside their mosques , Vietnamese holding up prize catches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; cyclopousse drivers in front of their odd , old-fashioned pedaled vehicles ; wives in stalls stirring soup . All of them are happy and joyful , and the background is Phnom Penh when it was the most beautiful city in Southeast Asia . All the photographs have names written on them in old-fashioned handwriting . On the table is a printout of thousands of names on slips of paper . Next to the table are matches and basins of ash and water . The implication is plain . Burn the names and transfer merit to the unmourned dead . Next to that is a small printed sign that says in English HELLO . Every Pchum Ben , those names are delivered to temples throughout the city . Gold foil is pressed onto each slip of paper , and attached to it is a parcel of sticky rice . At 8 A.M. food is delivered for the monks , steaming rice and fish , along with bolts of new cloth . At 10 A.M. more food is delivered , for the disabled and the poor . And most mornings a beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tonl Sap and Mekong rivers . Like Cambodia , she plainly loves all things modern . She dresses in the latest fashion . Cambodian R &B; whispers in her ear . She pauses in front of each new waterfront construction whether built by improvised scaffolding or erected with cranes . She buys noodles from the grumpy vendors with their tiny stoves . She carries a book or sits on the low marble wall to write letters and look at the boats , the monsoon clouds , and the dop-dops . She talks to the reflected sunlight on the river and calls it Father .
