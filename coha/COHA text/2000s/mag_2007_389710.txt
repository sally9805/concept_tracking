Just like bathing suits , sunscreens are n't one size fits all . Here 's more to consider before you shop for sun products . OUTDOOR ACTIVITY LEVEL Choosing a waterproof or sweatproof sunscreen is a no-brainer when you plan to be active outdoors . But there are times when it 's less obvious that you need one : " On very hot days , you 're going to be sweating quite a bit even if you 're not playing sports , " points out David E. Bank , M.D. , head of the Center for Dermatology , Cosmetic and Laser Surgery in Mt . Kisco , NY . ( Try the " ultra sweatproof " Coppertone Sport Continuous Spray SPF 50 Sunscreen , $7.99 . ) SKIN COLOR If you have fair skin , you know you need to wear sunscreen  --  plenty of painful sunburns have made that obvious . But even if you have darker skin and never burn , you 're still susceptible to wrinkles and skin cancer : " It 'll take longer to show up , but it still happens , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPF accordingly : If you have dark skin , wear at least an SPF 15 daily ( try Anthelios SX Daily Moisturizing Cream SPF 15 , $29 ) , and go higher for a day at the beach if you 've tanned through an SPF 15 in the past . Medium or Mediterranean skin ? SPF 15 is also your daily minimum  --  you should definitely go up to SPF 30 for days outdoors ( try MD Skincare Powerful Protections SPF 30 Sunscreen Lotion , $42 ) . If you have fair skin , wear an SPF 25 or 30 every day , and a 45 or 50 at the beach ( try Aveeno Continuous Protection Sunblock Lotion SPF 55 , $8.99 ) . One last note : Most of us do n't apply enough lotion to get the protection of the SPF number on the bottle . " You should apply sunscreen the same way you would an inexpensive moisturizer , " says Bank . " Generously . " INCIDENTAL SUN EXPOSURE Even if you have n't sunbathed since 1986 , you may still be getting sun damage . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year in , year out  --  the ones that do n't even burn us  --  can also cause cancer . Protect yourself on a daily basis with an SPF moisturizer ( try Olay Complete Defense Daily UV Moisturizer SPF 30 , $19 ) . It 's also a good idea to keep a small tube of sunscreen in your purse , for moments of unexpected exposure ( try Lumene On The Go Sun Care for Face &; Lips , SPF 40 , $18.99 ) . SKIN TYPE Sunscreen makes you rashy/break out/dry up ? It 's probably not the sunscreen itself that 's the problem but the base it 's in . If your skin is oily , opt for a mist , gel , or oil-free formula ( try DDF Matte Finish Photo-Age Protection SPF 30 , $25 ) . For dry skin , seek out a creamy base ( try Dermalogica Extra Rich Faceblock SPF 30 , $48 ) . Sensitive-skin sufferers should baby their skin with a sunscreen for children .

" You want to do everything you can to minimize damage to the skin cells , " says Bank , who recommends sunscreen formulas enhanced with antioxidants in this doubles-tennis analogy : " If sunscreen is the player at the net , antioxidants are at the service line , swatting any free radicals that get through . " ( Try Skin Effects Sun Effects SPF 45 Sunscreen Lotion , $12.99 , with antioxidant vitamins C and E. ) TIME SPENT IN THE CAR Your seat belt is n't the only safety device you need in the car ; you need sunscreen , too , because UVA rays will pass through glass . It 's particularly important to make sure your sunscreen has UVA protection ; look for ingredients like avobenzone , zinc oxide , titanium dioxide , or Mexoryl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 , $9.99 , with Helioplex , a new technology that provides longer-lasting protection against both UVA and UVB rays . ) Exposure to tanning beds before age 35 boosts melanoma risk by 75% <p>
