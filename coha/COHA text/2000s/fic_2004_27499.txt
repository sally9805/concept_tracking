1 How can some people 's lives look so good when they 're so foul underneath ? That 's the question I ask when I leaf through this photo album Macy gave me for my sixteenth birthday . I got it at my surprise party in October of sophomore year , three weeks to the day before Lani Garver showed up on Hackett . It 's full of pictures of me and Macy and our other friends , and we 've got some wild and happy parade of the teeth going on . And it 's not like we were faking happiness for pictures . That 's what terrifies me most . If anyone had asked , my friends and I would have said in a heartbeat , " We rule the cule , " and would have believed ourselves . Macy scrawled titles by each picture in her pretty handwriting that slants backwards . The one most likely to rip our sides was " Uh-Oh , The Umbrella Ride , " because of the disgusting story behind it , but like all " true brew stories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The summer after freshman year , Macy 's big sister , Mary Beth , decided it was time to introduce us to Oleander 's whiskey , better known by Hackett 's fishermen as Old Sweat Sock . She felt we were getting too cocky about our alcohol imbibement tales . Mary Beth was eighteen but had a fake ID . She bought a good-sized bottle of Old Sweat Sock at the Rod ' N ' Reel . The six of us passed this bottle around in her car as she gunned it down Mariner Road to Fisherman 's Wharf for some general goofing around . Myra Whitehall , who sat in the passenger seat , announced that she suddenly was n't feeling so great . Mary Beth did n't want to slow down , because this Jeep full of Hackett 's finest studs was bumper smooching her Mustang , and she did n't want them to see hurl flying out of her passenger window . She kept saying , " Deal with it , Myra ! " Myra could n't help rolling down the window , and to our disgust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard . Macy rooted through Mary Beth 's stuff and came up with an umbrella . She snapped it open and shoved it up in front of the four of us in back . When Myra 's stomach said , " No more , " we screamed some combo victory chant/barnyard noises , completely protected from impending doom . The Jeep passed us with all-too-embarrassing curses and loud requests for car wash reimbursement . Geneva Graham snapped this picture on the wharf right after we got there . I was smiling so completely . Except for Myra-who had just been ruined socially for at least a week-we all were . Right next to that photo there 's " Lesbian Hayride , " which happened around Halloween of freshman year . I do n't even remember how we lucked out so well , but Macy and I ended up in a hay wagon with about a dozen guys from the fish frat-that 's the sons of Hackett 's commercial fishermen , who are sometimes lifeguards and usually very hunky . We were trying not to act stupid , but also to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Mary Beth had lectured us , the only way to catch a guy in the fish frat is to pretend you do n't care . Macy and I were standing in the middle of this cart , baying at the moon , or something acceptably retarded , when the wagon jerked and I fell on my back . Macy fell on top of me-with my spider legs all sprawled and her in the middle of them . I tried to tell her to get off , but I was like a jellyfish-major embarrassment laughing fit in process . And I could hear her laughing just as hard in my ear . I did n't know this at the time , but supposedly watching lesbians is some hot thing for upper-classmen . And these hunks were joking , all " Go , ladies ! Be ladies ! " Macy loved the attention . I was paralyzed with shock , like I was every time my naiveness caught up with me . It was n't exactly a big secret-just something we rarely talked about-but I had missed a year and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of holes-everything you 'd learn in seventh grade and the first half of eighth . In this bonfire picture , we 're surrounded by upperclassmen fish frat , and my smile is plastered on due to information overload about lesbians . Two of these guys actually asked for our phone numbers , and I was n't even upset when they never called . The fact that they even asked was , like , too amazing . I figured they probably heard we were a couple of freshmen convent queens in disguise . The picture was good enough for me . " March , " " April , " " June , " " September " are four pictures on the same page . The first three were taken by my mom , of Macy teaching me a back handspring , each getting a little more graceful . " September " is my junior varsity cheerleading photo . Great stuff . " Not a cloud on the horizon , " an outsider might say . I can see a few clouds in some pictures , but only because I know my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homecoming Queen who never grew out of it , took a picture of me after my first day at Coast , all excited . She thought I was on my way to becoming her-I only had to add the cheerleading pom-poms and studly boyfriends . Macy called this picture " Claire Still Has No Friends But She 's Getting There . " I was sprawled out in a chair in our living room , with my head on my hand . My hair , miraculously , had grown past my shoulders in the six months since I went back to eighth grade . I no longer had " chemotherapy cheeks , " as my dad called them , which are the color of half-dried rubber cement . I see my hair , my complexion , and I can read some sort of magic determination in them : Get rid of the past . And my eyes caught the flash so they seemed to shine with hope . Coast Regional High School was a huge place , where girls with problems could remake their lives . New faces poured in from four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these kids , you did not have a past . There was a kind of hope whizzing around the corridors . Joe Hunk could ask you out tomorrow , even if you had been a dork-breath yesterday . You could work your way into a seat in the cafeteria at that fourth table from the door-which around here is known as the Queen 's Table-even if you were shoveled off to the corner with the invisible unknowns during the first week . Some eighth-grade science nerd could save up for a foil job , come into school a raving blond , and totally believe her life would change . I tried to tell myself just to forget about anything like becoming outrageously popular . I felt at a serious disadvantage even to a science nerd , having heard my last dirty joke at a sixth-grade pajama party , and then dropping into Homeschool Hell for the Sick for a year and a half . If you start eighth grade in January , completely naive , looking like something the cat dragged in , you can only hope for a huge high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But even my brain could n't help figuring out which crowds were going to have all the fun . A group of girls sat at the fourth lunch table from the door in the cafeteria , and they were so cute , and so not shy , and just mean enough that nobody would dare pick on them . Despite that cheerleading tryouts had not been held yet , they were starting to be called the Freshmen Cheerleaders , and their table was nicknamed-in mumbles from girls who did n't sit there-the Queen 's Table . I did n't doubt that these girls would be cool around here . In fact , they were all from Hackett , so I knew them from grade school , and they had been popular since about fifth grade , or whenever it is you start to think about stuff like that . Most had swapped jokes with me at a bunch of sixth-grade slumber parties . The second week of high school , I was going past them into the girls ' bathroom , and Eli Spellings did n't keep her voice low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her hair grew back way nice , at least . Remember her from January ? She looked like she 'd been nuked in a microwave . Was that sickening , or what ? " I went into a stall and leaned against the side , with my hand over my mouth . I totally forgot to sit down and go to the bathroom . I had been suspicious that these kinds of remarks flew . It 's just that people were polite enough not to say them where I could hear . Macy Matlock was standing in the middle of them , as usual , and happened to take a different view of the thing . I heard her mouth go off , because you ca n't miss that . " You pig , Eli . What the hell is wrong with you ? " I heard something like a slap , like she smacked a book to the floor , or cracked a notebook on the sink ledge . " That girl is one of the sweetest people you 'd ever want to meet , and not only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my way , and I prayed to wake up from this nightmare . But there she was , gazing in the stall door , because I 'd been too stupid to lock it . I glanced back , thinking the veins in my face would crack open . She grabbed my wrist , and before I knew it , we were moving back toward this bathroom meeting of the Queen 's Table , which amounted to about seven glares , all mowing me down to nothing . " I know you heard that , Claire . Eli has something to say . " Macy folded her arms across her chest , giving Eli the death look , and I waited for them to jerk past me and run , or get meaner . What I did n't understand had a lot more to do with Macy than anyone else . She has a big mouth , but her heart is bigger over certain matters of principle . Second , if she believes something and glares into your eyes , you believe it , too , no questions asked . For whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eli spit out what would have made the Pope happy . " Claire . Oh my god . I did n't know you could hear me , I mean ... not that I should be saying shit like that , anyway . I just ... last year ? I did n't know what to say to you , that 's all . I 'm just really stupid ... Okay ? " I glanced at Macy in stunned awe , then at the floor , realizing some response was expected . Nurses forever warned me that people would n't know what to say . It was completely forgivable . But it came out something like , " Forget it ... please ... I do n't think ... anyone should have to know ... what to say ... , " and my voice box pizzled out because I could n't smile and think of words at the same time . Macy kicked her in the ankle . " See ! Did I tell you she was sweet ? " Her loudness made me jump , and for whatever reason , they thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled me along with them . " Come on , hang with us ? I was at Kim Norris 's sixth-grade slumber party with you . Remember ? " I felt sure they were just feeling sorry for Claire with the Novelty Sickness in Her Past , and I did n't want that . We were going into fourth period , which meant the cafeteria , which meant they were thinking I would sit at the so-called Queen 's Table . I only got swept along with it because I was in shock . There 's a photo of all of us at the Queen 's Table , taken three days later by Myra . My arms are crossed , and I 'm biting my lip over my smile . I do n't belong at this table , or in this picture with Eli Spellings , Geneva Graham , and Macy Matlock . And if I smiled too big , they would see the evidence in the photo later . Macy called that one " Claire the Humble , Macy the Horrible . Every Bitch Needs a Claire . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had , because of her big mouth . For Macy 's good part , she would never tolerate evil treatment toward somebody who had done nothing to deserve it . For example , I had not done anything to deserve Eli 's bathroom ignorance , because you ca n't help having been sick . Macy would shove people for remarks on girls with huge chests , kids with bad skin , people with disabilities . But those people were few and far between compared to people who could help what was wrong with them . Other people were obnoxious , dorky , phony , smelly , fat-yet-overeating , whiny , wimpy , stingy , clumsy , overly horny , or butt smooches . She had managed to perfect herself and could not see why it was so hard for anybody else . And she would rip on these people and not care who heard . " Lyda Barone Bombs Out Macy " is a funny photo in a sick way , because I have this look of horror on my face as a glowing Lyda Barone clings to my arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a week , probably because I was the only person who had ever been nice to her . Everyone said she smelled . She looked like she would because she did n't wash her hair a whole lot , but I never actually smelled anything . My look of horror came because of a trick Macy had started to pull in pictures . She would plan out ways she could " enhance " the picture , all the way back to when she was posing . She knew she wanted to pen in " air stink " squiggles going from Lyda 's armpits to her own nose , so she posed all wide-eyed with her eyes going in that direction . I knew what she was up to , because she 'd done it before , but it was hard to lecture her when you 're cracking up . When I say a foulness lay under the surface of these pictures , I ca n't say exactly what breed of garbage was ready to squirt from behind each person 's eyeballs . But I can talk about myself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's foulness had to be there , and it had to be as big , or bigger , than my own . I say that because of what happened when Lani Garver showed up . A new kid walks into school , and you ca n't tell by staring whether it 's a girl or a guy . A stink the size of Kansas does n't get raised out of people 's sweetness and kindness . I ended up being a victim , and everyone else wound up on the **28;27;TOOLONG squad . What does that say about whose garbage is bigger ? And here 's some dirt on me : While all my daytime fun was going on , I had started having nightmares that were gory and disgusting . I would wake up all Claire , you are nuthouse material . In these dreams , girls I had never seen before would cut swirly designs in their legs with knives , or swallow forks , or part their hair with razor blades , stuff like that . I had n't had a single nightmare I could remember while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest time period of my life having these dreams like something out of a horror flick . And what 's worse is I was not entirely scared of them . Some totally sick part of me was obsessed with them . I would make them into songs that I would play on my electric guitar , down in the basement . I had a notebook full of lyrics that would have choked the devil . Sometimes I was all ashamed of this thing , and yet these lyrics rhymed and rhythmed out so well that I could n't bring myself to burn them . Nobody knew about this . Who could I tell ? Macy was tone-deaf . My mom would tell the whole island , and my dad had just gotten remarried . When I started my job at Sydney 's Caf , at the beginning of sophomore year , Macy took a picture and called it " Claire Decides to Ruin Every Saturday Night for Two Hours Over 25 Bucks . " It 's me with my acoustic guitar , singing cheery old folk songs into the mike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We actually had that photo album in the cafeteria during lunch on the day Lani Garver first showed up . Macy was cursing a blue streak because none of the pictures from my surprise party had turned out . " We finally get you a boyfriend in the fish frat , and there 's no evidence of ' Macy Performs a Miracle . ' Shit ... " A photo landed in front of me that was supposed to be me and Scott , but above our noses was only white and flash . " Smiles are good . " I handed it back , and she glared at my usual calm like a cat in the dark . " That was a miracle " - she started smacking overexposures down on the table , and I could n't argue- " being that you could n't seduce a tree trunk . " I laced my fingers across my stomach , stretching out in the chair and pondering on that . " Seduce somebody . Like , how do you seduce somebody ? Like , why should I have to seduce somebody ? Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that ? " Eli raised her head from copying Geneva Graham 's Spanish homework , and they both giggled . Macy threw her head down on the table in a shock fest . " Help this woman before she loses what I just helped her catch . She 's deeply disturbed . " " Watch this , Claire . " Eli nudged Geneva , who could catch just about anybody , at least for a night or two . " Do your peanut-butter thing . " I watched , mildly amused , as Geneva upset half the cafeteria , sucking peanut-butter glops off her pinky , her eyes burning a hole into one dying bastard after another . " You try . " She pushed her mutilated PB &J; at me . I blinked at it long enough to make them think I might . " I do n't eat peanut butter . " " Claire , Little Miss Chronic Diet , " Geneva groaned . " Use your salad dressing ! " " It 's watery , low-fat Italian . I 'll end up feeding my shirt . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no chance of this thing happening . " Hey , she already caught herself a hottie , without any peanut butter , cigarette lighter , Vaseline lip , dangly earring , tongue piercing , pedicure wiggling , sassy butt , helpless routine . " Myra stopped for air and her collie-dog eyes glowed . She was sweet . Always on my side . " You know , maybe you should be asking her for lessons . Claire , how 'd you catch Scott Dern ? " I looked down at my laced fingers , sniffing to break the silence . " I do n't know . I do n't think he likes me very much . He 's not exactly ... talkative . " " He 's fish frat ! They 're too cool to be motormouths . " Eli waved me down . " You have to get him alone . " " She 's had him alone . At least , she had him alone with me and Phil , " Macy snapped , and started tossing ruined photos over her back into the aisle in frustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night at Phil 's house , or the party night . Four rolls down the toilet ! What gives with this goddamn camera- " Eli , Myra , and Geneva were still stuck on the alone business , boring holes through me like three Cheshire cats . I just let my grin wander higher , so they could think what they wanted , because this conversation was moving dangerously close to some garbage I did n't want to spew about Scott . Albert Fein saved me by picking up one of the overexposed pictures as he came past with his tray . " Somebody 's pictures are on the floor . " " It 's a picture of Claire McKenzie in her underwear . If you want , she 'll autograph it . " Macy glared dead into his eyes , and Albert Fein was just dorky enough to try to stare through the overexposure . The girls cracked up until Albert 's ears turned red , and I held out my hand for it . " I 'm not in my underwear , Albert . Give it here . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it away , and I flopped my arm back down in frustration because I knew what was coming , and I knew it would start a fight with my friends . Macy said it for him in this nasty , screechy twang . " Are n't you that famous guitar player from Sydney 's ? Do n't you know anything , Albert ? ' Famous ' and ' Sydney 's ' do not go in the same sentence . This is an island . The only famous people are tourists . " I nodded hard in agreement , hoping that would end it , but it did n't . " She 's breaking up our Saturday nights ! For what , Albert ? " He grinned from ear to ear just because she was talking to him ; the fact that she was telling him off did n't seem to matter . " Well , I think it 's cool- " " Good , then you can go chuck money at her with all the fishwives while we 're waiting to go party . Now , give me that picture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dork attack , staring over my shoulder , down the aisle . Her hawk eye was working itself big-time on somebody , which was not unusual . But I was facing Myra , Geneva , and Eli , and their eyebrows were lowering , too . I tilted my head backward over my chair , and that was how I recognized Lani Garver from homeroom . Upside down . He had just stood up from a table over in the corner and was putting trash on a lunch tray . I brought my head back up and yawned . I probably could have ignored this whole thing nicely , if it was n't for Albert . " Is that thing a boy or a girl ? " My head snapped up to his braces smile , and thank god I was yawning , because I might have actually hollered at him . I could never forget what eighth grade felt like . And I did n't get how some overweight , underbuilt bucktoothed kid finds room to goof on somebody else who looks funny . Is it because we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypocrite ... " It 's a boy . " I kept yawning to keep from snapping the news . " The teacher asked how to spell his name . It 's L-A-N-I , but he said you pronounce it Lonny . " " Looks like a damn girl . " Albert kept up . " Except that would be one very tall girl . Jesus , maybe it 's one of those ... those ... hermaphrodisiacs- " I rubbed my eyes in annoyance , knowing Macy would handle it , which she did . " Who asked you ! The only thing I remember anyone asking you is to leave , mean face . Can the kid help it if he has long eyelashes and pink cheeks ? What are you-jealous ? Roll on out of here before somebody starts in on your looks . " I gave her the time-out sign because Albert was moving away from us , grinning to hide the redness on his ear tips . She turned her gaze to Myra and Eli and Geneva . " Cut it out ! No stare fests . Claire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinking as she kept rolling her neck to get the kinks out . Every roll gave her another opportunity to check out Lani Garver over my shoulder . And she did n't lecture again when Geneva piped up . " Claire , I think that guy is wearing blush and eyeliner . The teacher actually asked , ' Are you a guy ? ' " Eli and Myra turned to watch me suspiciously . I had noticed only two things in homeroom-his height and the drumsticks shoved into his jeans ' back pocket . I 'm five ten but would have only come up to this kid 's cheekbones . I had seen the sticks and thought , Hmm , a drummer . Way cool . " You know what ? I do n't think the teacher ever did ask- " " Claire , you are so dense . " Macy surrendered and stared . This boy-girl was now coming up the aisle , which gave me a chance to look without being too obvious . The first challenge was the combination of shoulders and face . I would n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders broad . And yet , you would look at this face and think , Girl . No question . Geneva had a point , because the face looked to be done over with really subtle makeup-until it got within about six feet of you . Then you realize , That 's not makeup . It 's just really peachy skin , overly thick eyelashes , natural pipeline lips . The dark hair was to Lani Garver 's shoulders-with the top layers kind of bobbed under and going behind the ears . Guys do n't plan their hair . Girl , I thought . Lani passed by us , and I looked at the back view . Most girls had hips . Guy ? I tried to look at this person as a butch girl , which would have worked , except for the big shoulder bones . I decided it looked slightly more like a gay guy . I waited as this Lani Garver turned left at the front and gave us a profile . Macy could always see into my head along with everybody else 's . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front . Nope , no triangles . " Her tone was curious and not mean , because if this turned out to be a girl , the haircut was cute , and no one can fault a girl for being over six foot and flat-chested . " God almighty . I hope it 's a girl . " Without her head moving , her eyes wandered sideways until they caught the table where the fish frat were sitting . I let my own eyes wander past the cluster of big muscles , anchor tattoos , and sunburnt noses even in chilly November . Fortunately , they were just talking among themselves and eating . The fish frat did n't notice people easily . They waited for everyone to notice them . Lani Garver 's dark-chocolate brown eyes caught on this and that thing on the tray , like there was no real thought , and all the staring did n't register . My eyes could n't help falling to you-know-where . I 'm not saying it was a huge bump . But girls ' jeans zippers tend to lean almost backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This zipper came out-at least more than it went in . Guy . Lani placed a tray in the holder above the trash can , then the hands smacked together in a dainty way , like to get the garbage-can dirt off them . Girl ? Then the eyes met mine . With a couple hundred kids in the cafeteria , there were a lot of different directions those eyes could have gone . It felt a little eerie . I met the gaze as evenly as I could , feeling weirdly challenged by it , like I had to prove I was n't intimidated . I ended up breaking this brief looking-match because Macy nudged me hard in the arm . A picture landed in front of me . " The only one . In four rolls . What is up with that ? " Lani Garver 's stare was forgotten for the moment . I gazed at the picture and tried not to move at all . That was my trick when I became completely nervous . If I do n't move , nobody will notice me ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be invisible . My internal freaking had to do with two things in this picture : the great smile on my face and the horrible thoughts that had been running through my brain at that time . " Must have something to do with your flash , " I managed to mutter , because Macy was six inches away , looking right at my face . " If you 'd get rid of your Barbie camera and buy something decent- " Geneva giggled . Macy turned to her . " It 's just pink ; it 's not Barbie . Shut up . " I could not get over my smile in the picture . Macy snapped it about fifteen seconds after I came out of my house yesterday morning . I had not seen her at first . I was counting the number of days I had been extremely tired , and the number of times I 'd gotten dizzy . I was trying to decide whether I was having a cancer relapse . I remember deciding that it had surely returned . Then I looked up and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking , I made peace signs with both hands and smiled . In this picture I was smiling the most peaceful smile I had ever seen in my life . " Claire , Jesus Christ ! " Macy snatched a plastic salad fork from my hand . I realized I had picked it up and raked my thumb over it . It had snapped . I glanced at the few drops of blood on the blank page of the photo album and stuck my thumb in my mouth and sucked . " You got blood all over the page ! " I mumbled around my thumb , " Three drops . Chill out . " " Are you all right ? " " Fine . " " You 're a klutz ! " " Part of my charm . " " You stuck your thumb right down on that ! What is wrong with you ? Let me see . " I let her pull my thumb out of my mouth , before she raised a loud enough stink that everyone would be looking . It was a deep cut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final look at the three drops on the page . " Do n't be giving me heart attacks . I hate blood . " I sat stock-still after putting my thumb back up to my teeth . I did n't know which thought was making me freeze worse-that I might have a blood disease , or that my **35;57;TOOLONG nightmares might be invading my real life . Macy hawkeyed my face , and I knew I had n't managed to completely wipe off my horrified look . She followed my eyes , which happened to be laying into Lani Garver , who had retreated to the semidarkness of the alcove between the cafeteria and the B corridor . Macy never misses a trick , but her imagination was only as big as her world . " Are we about to have another Lyda Barone adventure ? Are you going to have ants in your pants until you can be nice to that new kid ? I guess ... you remember what it felt like to be the new , huh ? " I let out an absent laugh . Talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to talking about my leukemia . It 's not that I did n't trust my friends to be nice and sympathetic . It 's just that fun-loving kids do n't hear that sort of stuff very well . I never wanted to think about junior high , let alone talk about it , and it 's probably one of the reasons I adored my friends so much . I loved their carefree outlooks on life more than anything under the sun . Macy groaned . " Fine . If you really must go say hello and sing , like , ' The Happy Welcome Song , ' I 'll come along for the ride . Just ... please do n't bring any more strange people over to our table . I end up being the one doing the that-seat's-taken routine after a week of dork overload , and I 've got a heart , too , Claire . " I laughed , removing my thumb . " Do n't make me out to be some saint . That 's so not true- " " Girl Scout , then . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It makes you blush . Look . Perfect chance . See where he-perhaps-she is ? " She sized up Lani . A paperback book was open in the long , graceful fingers . " It 's a girl . Guys do n't read books . At least , not in public . " " I swear , Macy . I have less than zero interest in going over there . " " Do n't ruin my image of you , Claire . Maybe I admire your heart . Now 's your chance to be nice . I know you 're feeling sorry for that new kid . " She was telling the truth . She just was n't telling all of it . " Yeah ? And I 'll bet right now , Macy , your biggest problem is , you wo n't be able to stand yourself until you find out if that 's a girl or a boy . " She raised her eyebrows shamelessly . " Hey , I 'm not the one blowing my hair under while putting a tight shirt over zero tits . That person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around for some answers . I 'm just a victim here . " " You 're a victim , and I 'm a white whale . " She laid the peace-sign-and-smile photo into the album and scrawled beside it , " Claire as Usual . " I flinched but did n't have a whole lot of time for backlash thoughts . " Come on . Let 's go find out . " She pulled me to my feet , and I let myself be dragged along by the wrist .
