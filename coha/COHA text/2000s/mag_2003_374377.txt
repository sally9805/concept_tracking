With their thick , wavy hair parted neatly on the side , cherubic faces and unfailingly polite manners , Derek King , 14 , and his brother Alex , 13 , come across like choirboys . But the Florida teenagers were sentenced last November to eight and seven years in prison , respectively , after admitting that they had bludgeoned their father to death with a baseball bat . The previous year brought two other trials of Florida kids who had committed murder : Lionel Tate , also 14 , got a life sentence for beating a 6-year-old playmate to death , and Nathaniel Brazill , another 14-year-old , was sent to prison for 28 years for killing his middle-school teacher . <P> What could possibly turn kids this young into brutal killers ? The recipe for violence is almost certainly a mix of bad genes and a bad environment , and the evidence is strong that the recipe is cooked up very early in life . Until about a decade ago , most experts assumed that it was a violent or impoverished upbringing that led to violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gang members in West Side Story , " on account of we 're deprived . " Indeed , studies had suggested a correlation between a harsh childhood and later criminality . The link was strongest for those who had been physically abused as kids . Still , not all abused children grow up to perpetrate violence in turn . Something else must be going on . <P> One possible answer began to emerge after a Dutch woman consulted her doctor about whether to have kids . Her family had a history of violence , including rape and attempted murder . Would her children be violent too , she asked ? Her doctor consulted geneticist Hans Brunner , who discovered that the family carried a defective gene : it made too much of an enzyme , called monoamine oxidase A , resulting in excessive destruction of neurotransmitters that help keep us calm and happy . <P> The finding thrilled some scientists  --  here , finally , was an explanation for criminality  --  and appalled others , who feared that if genes dictate behavior , it could lead to genetic typecasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have the defective gene , while many noncriminals do . Here , too , the simple explanation was clearly not the whole story . <P> Last summer , though , scientists at the University of Wisconsin reported on a long-term study of 400 boys that had been going on for more than a quarter-century . The scientists had collected DNA from the boys and recorded their behavior at regular intervals . As with the earlier research , scientists found that neither genes alone nor childhood abuse alone could explain adult violence . But of the boys who had both mutation and early abuse , fully 85% had committed a violent act as an adult . The implication , says Terrie Moffitt , a professor of psychology at Wisconsin : " Genes influence people 's susceptibility or resistance to environmental ' pathogens . ' " Someone with a low genetic propensity will have to be pushed very hard to become violent ; another individual with a different genetic makeup might have a hair trigger .                 @ @ @ @
