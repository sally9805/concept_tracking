With oil prices heading toward $79 a barrel , the age of the solar panel is dawning at last , and electronics companies from the land of the rising sun are leading the way . Decades of money-losing research and development are finally paying off at Japanese electronics giants like Sharp , Sanyo , Mitsubishi and Kyocera , who together control about 50% of the global market . " The solar units of these companies are already real businesses , and they are only going to become larger parts of their operations , " says Yuki Sugi , a Lehman Bros. analyst in Tokyo who covers Sharp and Sanyo . <P> Sharp , the world 's market leader , sold more than $1 billion worth of solar panels last year and expects a 28% increase this year . Sanyo expects a 60% sales increase this year , and at Kyocera , solar panels account for 5% of the company 's total sales and 12% of its operating profit . " Solar is a booming business , " says Sharp president Katsuhiko Machida , " and it is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few oil resources of its own , Japan has long made alternative-fuel research and conservation national priorities . Meanwhile , electronics companies have been deeply interested in the power management of their devices and in silicon-based materials like computer chips  --  technologies at the heart of silicon solar-panel manufacturing . Unlike in other countries , where oil and gas companies tend to research solar energy , electronics companies here have no other energy divisions to worry about compromising . <P> In Japan panel companies and the national government kick-started solar-power adoption with subsidies . A consumer who installs a solar-panel array on a house can sell surplus energy to the local utility . Germany has implemented that model most successfully , and it has been adopted not just in Japan but in South Korea and other European countries . Even with incentives , start-up costs are high , about $20,000 per household in Japan . " The biggest priority now is to reduce costs , " says Seiichi Kiyama , general manager of the commercial group of Sanyo Electric 's solar division . <P> True cost competitiveness is within reach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company executives and outside analysts estimate that a further 50% reduction , which would make **25;18676;TOOLONG costs comparable with other types of fuel , is possible within the next decade . And because natural-gas and coal prices are increasing along with oil prices , the cost competitiveness of solar power could come a lot earlier . <P> In the U.S. , government incentives are not as developed , but consumers are starting to demonstrate a new awareness of environmental issues . Consider the popularity of the Toyota Prius and other hybrid cars . And design advances are winning converts : see-through solar panels installed in place of regular window glass are a classy upgrade from black rooftop arrays . <P> No one is declaring the end of fossil fuels , and solar-panel proponents are wary not to repeat the unfulfilled promises of the past . Solar power accounts for less than 1% of the world 's energy production , and even the rosiest forecasts predict that number wo n't exceed 10% by 2030 . Still , the industry has got its jump start . " This is ultimately a hopeful business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good business to be in. "
