Need a little boost of power to get you through the yard work this fall ? The $299 Cargomaxx from Country Home Products is a battery-powered wheelbarrow that lets you lug up to 400 lbs . of logs , rocks or equipment  --  as well as bulky loads of leaves  --  without breaking your back . The 24-volt rechargeable battery drives the wheel at speeds of up to 3 m.p.h. on a 25% slope . The Cargomaxx still needs a human touch : you have to hold on to the handles to keep it steady . <P>  --  A.H .
