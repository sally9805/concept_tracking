Editor - Several thoughtful letters to the editor have pointed out that $25 billion will not be nearly enough to save the dinosaur auto companies , even if they do come up with new business plans . So why waste the money ? Would n't it be better to spend it on workers who become unemployed if the companies fail ? <p> Yet House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other members of Congress are really , really loath to consider Chapter 11 or any shakeup of the company management teams . Why are they not listening to us , the unwilling investors , in any bailout scheme ? Could it be that we are not speaking loudly enough ? <p> We need to contact our senators , congresspeople , blogger friends , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , the Obama team , etc. , and demand at least the following , no matter what form of help or protection is agreed upon : No auto company executive can take home , in salary and benefits , more than 40 times the pay of the lowest-paid employee . <p> All bonuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAFE standards shall be raised and a sales surtax imposed on SUVs , which have received a free pass in the past . Our voices deserve to be heard . <p> KRISTIN ANUNDSEN San Francisco <p> Editor - Occasionally an issue comes up that smacks me with its poignancy and potential heartbreak . <p> We should be deeply suspicious about the real agenda in ridiculing the CEOs of the auto industry . <p> Funny how the one of last fully unionized workforce is getting demonized , is n't it ? <p> We ca n't let the economy go into further free fall . Think of the battered wives , the child abuse , the suicides . <p> Please join me in asking our elected representatives to see that no more manufacturing industries go out of business in this country . <p> Lives of Americans are at stake in this one . <p> LAUREN COODLEY <p> Napa <p> Editor - I do n't think anyone is blameless in the events that led up to the current crisis in the U.S. auto industry . But I have to wonder at the recent vilification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't have been focusing on high-profit SUVs and neglecting to design and engineer small fuel efficient quality cars . And they should n't have been catering to stockholders demanding high returns on their stock investments . And they should n't have rolled over to union demands for top wages and benefits . <p> But I wonder : Who was buying all those SUVs all those years and did n't mind the poor fuel economy ? And who beat up the manufacturers stock prices when they did n't deliver top dividends and stock appreciation ? And when faced with ever-increasing union demands over the past few decades , it 's hard to blame the automakers for giving in and avoiding protracted strikes . The auto executives were in a tough position in a culture where everyone feels entitled to get their own , regardless of social , economic and environmental costs . <p> Any executive who tried to make a stand for sensible , less-profitable autos would have lost his or her job . <p> So when we look at who 's to blame , I think we need to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it all . <p> NEIL EHRESMAN Pacifica <p> Editor - I am 5 feet 10 inches and 243 pounds . I am to big to fail ! Where is my bailout money ? And why are these politicians and bankers and lenders not going to jail for fraud where they belong ? <p> DON MALONE Concord <p> Editor - The San Francisco Auto Show was fun but in a bubble . <p> You 'd never guess Detroit or our whole planet is in trouble . <p> CLAUDIA BODMER <p> San Mateo <p> Editor - Regarding " It 's time Dellums hired manager " Nov. 25 : Mayor Ron Dellums just does n't get it , clearly . For that matter , nor do the City Council members . For the last two years , I 've heard repeated calls for the mayor to start doing his job , and yet it never happens . Now , after two years , does anyone think anything will change ? It 's clear that the bulk of Oakland 's problems stem from a lack of leadership , an inability to make decisions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Dellums had any self-respect , he would resign now and preserve what dignity he has remaining . The same goes for the City Council , although I 'm quite sure they cashed out their self-respect and dignity allowance long ago . <p> If any of them really cared about this city , they would step aside and let new blood in . Oakland has so much going for it : location , location , location - and yet it is mismanaged by people with little or no vision and certainly no respect for the residents of this city . <p> West Oakland has the potential to be a commercial and retail hub , with easy access from the freeways and being close the Bay Bridge and BART . Yet it is a wasteland , a place where people dump garbage on the streets , use doorways and stoops as public restrooms , where drug deals are commonplace and no one wants to go . I know , I live here . <p> People : Dellums and the City Council are never going to take action ; not now , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for change ! " <p> PETER MCNIFF Oakland <p> Editor - Regarding " Congestion Fee ' Doable " Nov. 24 : I 'd like to point out that the idea of charging me a fee to drive into the city is based on a flawed premise , i.e. , that public transportation is a practical alternative . In my case , a ferry or bus . <p> The ferry offers hard plastic chairs , hot sun , stifling air , filthy carpets , outdoor waiting lines that are unprotected from wind and rain , an inadequate schedule and commuter-discounted tickets that would cost me $14 per day . A lot of money for a second-rate ride . As for the bus , I found it to be totally unreliable , regularly running 20 to 30 minutes late . Got tossed around like a sack of potatoes by the jackrabbit starts and abrupt stops , assaulted by all manner of perfumes and body odors and physically battered by dozens of backpacks twisting to and fro with the jerking of the bus . No thanks - that sort of transport belongs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be " doable , " I 'd rather it is n't " done " to me . <p> ARNIE FREEMAN Tiburon <p> Find Documents with Similar Topics Help Below are concepts discussed in this document .
