This was just before my thirtieth birthday . I was in graduate school , of all places . I had no idea why . None of us did . We were extremely well-spoken rubber duckies . You could push us in any one direction , and we would flounder on forever . Sometimes , in the drowsy winter hallways , my conscience would rear up and remind me I was dumb with luck . Other times , I wished they 'd turn the whole place into a homeless shelter . <p> But the day I 'm talking about was early spring . The Gallery pears were in blossom , thousands of tiny white camisoles . I was out in front of the Comp Lit compound with Legget , watching the undergrads . We were vaguely aware of the distinctions between them . Mostly , they were just tan calves drifting past . <p> A woman entered my field of vision from the right . She had the plumpest cheeks I 'd ever seen . Her eyes were pinched at the corners , and blue patches stood out below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a year . Every other woman I could think of seemed stingy and coarse and obvious by comparison . She waved timidly at Legget . <p> " You like that , do you ? " he said . <p> " Who is she ? " <p> " She 's in my French class . " Legget stubbed out his cigarette . <p> " Polish , I think . " <p> " What 's her name ? " <p> " Do n't know , " Legget said . " She does n't say much . ' <p> For the next week , I walked around babbling about The Polish Woman . " You know me " I said . " I do n't gawk . I 'm not a gawker . " This was more or less true . Somewhere in the mid-twenties it dawned on me that female beauty did n't require any encouragement from me . Female beauty was doing just fine on its own . But I could n't get this woman out of my head . <p> Legget diagnosed sexual infatuation . <p> " Ca n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Like spotting a rare species , a species you might see once and never again , for the rest of your life ? " <p> " Spare me , " Legget said . <p> Two months later , in the computer lab , a woman in a white blouse swept into the seat next to mine . " Is it all right ? " she said . Her accent was excruciating : the burred diphthongs of Russian , the sulky lilt of French . My heart did a little arpeggio . <p> " You 're Polish , " I said . <p> She turned , and there was her face again . Her lips drew together , as if stung by some impending calamity . " Yah . How do you know ? " <p> I explained about Legget . She nodded slowly . <p> " Do you like Kosinski ? " I said . <p> " Oh yah ! " she said . " Have you read Painted Bird ? " <p> " Sure , " I said . " Wow . It 's hard to find anyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , for instance , had not read Kosinski , though I 'd heard he was quite good . " What a writer ! " I said . " What sentences ! " On and on I went until , finally , at a loss for what to say next , I asked for her phone number . <p> She looked at me for a few seconds-I was in my teaching uniform , a rumpled white button-down and khakis-then wrote her name on a piece of paper : Basha . <p> " I do n't do this normally , " I said . " But , I mean , I really love Kosinski . " <p> And then she was standing on the median of Summit Avenue , lit up inside a beige windbreaker . She looked elegant and chimerical : the head of a lioness , the body of a swan . At dinner , I choked on my chicken korma . That was just for starters . I got lost on the way to the theater . I misplaced my wallet , and had to race home to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British drawing-room melodrama-and sat in the darkened theater trying to figure out who was doomed and who fated . I spent most of the time smelling Basha , glancing at her profile , my fingers greasy with popcorn . <p> The amateur psychologists in the crowd will perhaps sense the significance of the lost wallet : The subject subconsciously enacts a fantasy in which he is stripped of his identity through a powerful , exotic love . <p> To which I would respond : Doy hickey . <p> I was ravenous for an affair so grandiose as to obliterate my life . Most every relationship I 'd formed in the past five years had gone south : romantic entanglements , friendships , professional alliances . One friend referred to me as a train wreck . Another suggested " emotional atom bomb " as perhaps closer to the mark . The ones I could n't scare away , I managed to drive off over some perceived slight . I was the world 's welterweight champion of the silent feud . I did n't see it that way , of course . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that I sought out rejection , engineered the drama of fresh grievances to distract me from older , stale forms of grief . <p> But that 's not the story I 'm telling now . No one-except those paid to listen-really wants to hear your musty songs of self-contempt . What we want is the glib aria of disastrous love , which is , finally , the purest expression of self-contempt . <p> Her full name was Basha Sabina Olszewska . She pronounced her last name beautifully : Olshevska . It meant something like a birch tree , she said . I thought of Frost : the pale trunk , the quick fire . She came from Katowice , an industrial city in the west of Poland . She hoped to become a translator . English was her fifth language . <p> She had a sense of humor as well . Imagine . She told me a story about dining with the Dean of Students at a welcoming banquet for exchange students . " They brought him steak , " she said . " I could n't believe the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet for a second , and just at that minute I turned to him and said : ' You have such huge meat ! ' " <p> This story thrilled me-its slapstick reference to the male part . Basha knew what a cock was ! She understood the great harmless joke that all cocks come to in the end . And this idea , however improbably , led to the idea that she might touch my cock . <p> We were eating at my place . She was sitting there at my table , daintily cutting her chicken . I told stories about my life that suggested-far less subtly than I supposed-what a terrific guy I was . I cleared her plate and took it to the sink . Was n't I the disarmingly liberated bachelor type ? She stood . I stepped in front of her and let my face fall forward . She executed a brisk little side  --  step . My lips smeared the side of her cheek . A pine cone fell from the tree outside , striking the roof with a soft thud , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dorm , I said : " Will I ever get to kiss you ? " <p> Her lips pursed , like a waiter who is out of the most popular item on the menu . The light fell across her in frets . " Such an American question ! " She told me about some Finnish jerk she 'd fallen for first term . And now she was returning to Poland and felt too vulnerable-the word seemed to swirl around her tongue  --  to get involved . <p> To which I wanted to say : Involved ? Who needs involved ? <p> This was one of the advantages of age . I 'd been rejected enough times to understand that prudence meant little in the face of sustained negotiation . Virtue was a better guide , all things considered . You could maybe depend on virtue . But a guy like me , with my wonderful rage , my American case of Manifest Destiny , I was n't about to back down from a little prudence . " Sure , " I said . " I understand . I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so relieved at my grace , she gave herself to me . She needed the help of a large bottle of inexpensive sauvignon blanc , which disappeared down her throat , cup by cup , while I watched in cautious rapture . It seemed terribly important that I do nothing to startle her . Slowly , perceptibly , my kitchen grew warm with the promise of contact . I ca n't recall a word that passed between us . There was only the wine , my silence , her mouth fixing to the rim of her cup , the slight , glottal pull of her underlip against and away from its surface , her white throat reaching up , descending . <p> We kissed , and she smiled , her lips turning back on themselves . Her teeth were faintly discolored , as if she 'd had a quick bite of ashes . I had never seen the classic Slavic facial structure at such close quarters . When she laughed , her cheeks rose with the strange , graceful bulk of glaciers and her eyes became Mongol slashes . Frowning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princess . Even at rest , impassive , her face expressed the severe emotions I associated with true love , which I had always known to be exquisite and doomed and slightly stylized . <p> I felt the pleasing thickness of her , damp beneath her garments . We were on my mattress , yanking off clothes . She had narrow shoulders , tiny budded breasts . Her arms and belly were robed in baby fat . <p> We made love , or fucked , did that thing where our center parts fit and unfit , a half dozen times , in panicky sessions , ten minutes or so , until she cried out Tak ! Tak ! then fell still . She consented to my movements with her body and spoke only once , toward dawn , saying , as my hand brushed up her thigh , " I am having so wet . " I knew then-at that exact moment-Basha had been sent to rescue me from the dull plight of my life . <p> This , it would turn out , is the main thing we had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I saw her across the street , her arms poking out of a red dress with white polka dots , the fabric tight around her bum . She came to me and kissed me , and I could smell the rot of her mouth . And the rot of her mouth turned me on ! ( Is there nothing the early days of love wo n't fetishize ? ) <p> We went to the mall , to buy last-minute gifts . Basha circled the pavilion , fretting over a belt , a bottle of lotion , blushing at the inquiries of the sales staff . She was a nervous shopper , which I took to be a mark of her unfamiliarity with the ritual . I had all sorts of crappy ideas rattling around my head about life in Poland . I knew , vaguely , that the Poles had broken from the Soviet Bloc . But I still imagined a lumpen gulag : endless lines , bare shelves , faces like potatoes in kerchiefs . And my poor Basha trapped amid this needy vulgarity ! I stood behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those ! Make it two ! Why not ? Do you have this in black ? <p> Our relationship was filed under dalliance , which allowed us to write one another without much pressure . Basha was an excellent correspondent . She made it a point to send me sexy photos of herself . My favorite showed her leaning toward the camera , kissing at a cigarette , mascara smeared , hair tousled-a Bond girl at the end of a long vodka party . <p> That summer , I got stoned , sat on my porch , tried to figure out where everyone had gone . Across the street , guys with whistles were running a girls ' soccer camp , which I could watch if I was n't too obvious . The girls were sweet and clumsy . They lacked the essentials of the sport-the ability to steal and confront and tackle-but their legs enjoyed flirting with these ideas . I was supposed to be writing a dissertation . <p> My answering machine was the enemy . Often , returning from the grocery store , or the Greek diner where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashing smugly and punched the machine . Then , one day , there was a message . <p> Hayizmeimeezyucullme . <p> When I called her back , Basha wanted to know , immediately , if she would ever see me again . " I made a breakup with my boyfriend , " she said . <p> " What boyfriend ? " <p> " It does n't matter , " she said . " I have my vacations at end of August " <p> At the airport in Warsaw , she came running , her eyes blurry hazel , a skirt shaping her hips , and she was far too beautiful for me , my sharp face and chickeny bones . I felt ( as I often feel ) a dramatic error in the accounting , though she pressed herself to me and made me feel , thereby , in the midst of that lousy airport , with its plastic counters and vague feculence , different from myself , heroic . <p> We found a cheap hotel and signed in as man and wife . Basha did the talking , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am a whore , " Basha said in the elevator . She smiled , her gums like a second , wetter smile . " Maybe I am a whore . " She shut the door to our room , and tore the button off my pants . I 'd seen this sort of thing , in films hoping to suggest reckless passion . But this was the first time I 'd been inside the animal experience , so famished for physical love as to overleap the gooey crescendo of intimacy . We never even got our shirts off . <p> Basha wanted nothing to do with clitoral stimulation , tricky positioning , languorous gazes . Put it in , was her agenda . Let the flesh speak . Her face went rubbery . She took on the aspect of a madwoman plucked from one of Hogarth 's Bedlam prints , ready to tear her hair , throw shit , which pleased me , as did her internal muscles , which yielded in rings of contraction . Sun from the window lit a glaze of nervous perspiration on her small white breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " Make big come in my pussy . " <p> " Tell me- " <p> " Now . Now-now-now . " <p> Afterward , her body looked like something tossed ashore . <p> Basha reached down and took hold of me : " You have huge meat . " <p> I laughed . <p> " Really , " she said . <p> " I 'm pretty sure I have normal meat , " I said . <p> " No " she said . " I remember the first time we were together , when I first saw , thinking this . " <p> I studied her expression for some sign of caginess . But caginess was not her style . She did n't speak about the particulars of sex in the same way an American woman might . And she appeared quite serious in her assessment , as if my size were a matter she had considered privately . <p> My ego flew in wild circles overhead . Is there nothing man desires more than to be regaled about his own huge meat ? <p> Basha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was two years old . He was no more than a blurry figure in photographs , with her tiny arrow of a nose and tangled teeth . Her first love-her only great love , from what I could tell-was her stepfather , Tomas , a gentle mathematician who had worshipped Basha 's mother . <p> " What happened to him ? " I said . <p> " He died when I was eight " she said . " Returning from a conference in Germany . There was snow on the road . " <p> " My God , " I said . " I 'm so sorry . " <p> I reached for Basha , but she slipped to the side of the bed and sat up , regarding me curiously . " Do n't be sorry . I barely remember . " <p> In Krakow , we went to see the palace , but it was closed for repairs , so we walked to the other end of the plaza . The tourist bureau had organized a folk dancing festival , surly teenagers spinning in peasant garb . Basha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and open-toed sandals . I thought about all the girls in their summer dresses , and tried to understand why I cared only to look at Basha . <p> We made love in our muggy pension room , lathered one another in the shower , then returned to the plaza to feel the breeze on our limbs , which were sore in secret places , to watch the stars against the drape of night and browse the stalls of painted eggs and cigarette cases . The cafes were open , the tabletops lit by bouncing candles . <p> My own tranquility astounded me . <p> " What do you think about ? " Basha said . <p> " Night " I said . " A beautiful night like this . " <p> She squeezed my hand and leaned in for a kiss . Her eyes were deep green and perfectly serious . In a soft , almost embarrassed voice , she said : " I want to come to America to make a life with you , David . ' Her hands were trembling . Her breathing was ragged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . <p> " Yes ? " she whispered . " What do you think about it ? " <p> Had n't I come to Poland in the hopes of just such a plea ? Do n't we all , in the private kingdom of our desires , dream about such pleas ? And yet , there was something deflating about the declaration . Without warning , in one sentence , Basha had called an end to the hunt , laid herself before me , forced me to make good on the promises of my extravagant furious charm . I felt my heart chop . <p> We were ideally suited to the long-distance relationship , with its twisted calculus of wish fantasy and deprivation . We wrote long epistles full of desire and ardent grief . We perfected the art of nostalgia : extracting the finer moments from the tangle of actual experience , burnishing them with new longing . We took the inconvenience of our love as the proof of its profundity . <p> And so , Christmas in Poland . Katowice struck me as suitably impoverished . Men selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soaked their aprons , while the wives peddled the shiny roe . Everyone looked glum and underdressed ; the sidewalks ran off into mud . <p> Basha lived with her mother , but they were both at work . She 'd left me the key to the apartment . Her building was part of a massive Soviet-style panelak , crinkled like a fan , five stories of concrete smeared with soot , stairwells sharp with piss . Her room was the size of a cell : a single bed , a dresser , a desk with my letters neatly stacked in one corner . Over the bed , she 'd taped a picture of us kissing on a street corner in Krakow . I 'd taken the photo myself , holding the camera with one hand while hauling her into an embrace . The white pelt of Basha 's cheek was draped across the frame , her eyes closed , her mouth thrown toward the kiss . The photo was blurred : as if the action captured had been terribly swift , or the moment dreamed . Outside , snow fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard the tock of a woman 's shoes , my body tensed . <p> Basha burst into the apartment finally , out of breath , her eyes glassy . I experienced the brief paralysis of gratification . You mean this is actually mine ? Her hands slipped beneath my sweater . Her minty tongue touched mine . Basha hauled me into her room . The smell of her rose up , a sweet bacterial tang . She let out a luxurious sigh as I slid into her . So much drama ! It was like leaping onto Broadway cock-first . <p> And later , scrubbed and pink-eared , I sat at the Olszewskas ' dining room table , gorged on rice laced with cumin and slivers of sauteed liver . Mamu appeared , flushed from the cold ( and , it would turn out , a good deal of wine ) . She was a handsome woman , wide cheeks and a plucked mouth . Basha 's face bloomed . It was clear at once that they were deeply in love , as mothers and daughters sometimes grow to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood , and Mamu looked me over . I could see Basha watching us , the slowing of her breath . Mamu shook my hand and announced , in her wobbly English , that she was delighted to meet me . Then she pulled me into a sloppy hug , and Basha laughed and pulled me back to her side , scolding Mamu in Polish , a language that seemed to me always , in the mouths of the Olszewska women , a volley of quick and playful whispers . <p> What did I have to do ? Stand there and look pretty . This was the secret dividend of loving a woman from a foreign country : very little was required of me . <p> " We will have wodka " Mamu said . <p> " Vodka " Basha said . <p> " Vodka , " Mamu corrected herself elaborately . <p> Yes ! Vodka with bitter tonic and lemon wedges , drunk from tall glasses . And later , in Mamu 's room , plum brandy from snifters . The three of us were huddled at the foot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her room accommodated a single bed , a bookshelf , a small dresser for clothes . <p> Mamu was one of those smokers whose motions are so calm and practiced , so assumed , that the act becomes an extension of their personality . She preferred a brand called Petit Coeurs , whose box was decorated in tiny gray hearts . The cigarettes themselves were as slender as lollipop sticks . Mamu could kill one in six draws , though often she let them burn down untended , the ashes making elegant snakes . She seemed to enjoy the option of smoking as much as the act . <p> Basha and I took the tram to the central plaza , with its smooth new cobblestone and stately , gabled buildings , refurbished with foreign money and painted in cake-frosting colors . These housed clubs and restaurants and clothing shops , for tourists , of course , but also for the emerging class of strivers represented by Basha and her friends , who had learned the first lesson of the bourgeoisie : that the acquisition of wealth required , to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited a few clubs , smoky places full of old pop songs and young people trying hard to acquire the defensive irony of American culture . This made me sad . But liquor helped soften my sadness , helped me occupy a little more gracefully my role as Basha 's exuberant Americanski . We wound up in some hotel lounge . Basha was there , next to me , laughing . The other women , dour and beautiful , watched me . I downed shot after shot and proposed toasts in mangled French and serenaded Basha with a fair rendition of Elvis Presley . Some fellow pulled a glass pipe from his pocket . " Hash , " he said . " Hashish . " I smoked some of that , too . Sure . I was the star . The star drinks . The star smokes . <p> Then we were outside , on the stumbling cobblestone , under the splotchy moon . Basha folded herself into me . Everything about her seemed perfect just then : her cheeks , the way her mouth smooshed vowels , her new decadence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was true . But was n't that just part of the mystery ? Was n't that , in some sense , the entire point ? <p> That we made love , I recognized only by the feeling of my lower body , a wet , suctiony joy . Most nights , I would have curled around her , kissing the skin between her shoulder blades , my low arm going slowly numb beneath her . But the bed did n't seem entirely solid , seemed more in the nature of an ocean . Salt rose in my throat , and I staggered to the bathroom . My body heaved and gasped . I suspected-as do all unpracticed drinkers-that I would never feel right again . Far above , I could see the racks of emollients , Basha 's cherished blow-dryer , pantyhose laid like molted skin across the radiator , a calliope of homely bras . <p> There was a tap on the door . Basha . Basha come to rescue her lover . <p> I struggled to my feet and opened the door . Mamu stood in her robe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sweetness of her daughter 's sex , like flesh that has been perfumed and licked , rose into the air between us . I wanted to duck behind the door , but in that moment such an action seemed to constitute an accusation . <p> " You are sick ? " Mamu said . She was careful not to let her gaze drop below my chest . <p> " I drank too much , " I said . " Wodka . " I pantomimed taking a shot , and in this motion , as my arm rose to my mouth , my fingers flipped toward my lips , I became acutely aware of my cock , rising up , settling back . <p> " You would like tea ? " Mamu said . <p> " Oh no , " I laid a palm on my stomach . Mamu glanced down , not entirely understanding the gesture , and her eyes settled there for a moment , not even a moment , a charged little half moment . <p> How long had it been since Mamu had looked upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried two husbands , and , by Basha 's account , no longer considered the idea . But Basha did not yet understand what a stubborn customer the body is . The heart may turn the lights out . The body never closes for business . <p> " No tea ? " she said . <p> " No , thank you . " <p> " Okay , " Mamu whispered . She stepped back into the hallway and turned ; her robe traced the soft square of her hips . She had the same body as Basha , after all , only dragged by time , by the tolls of motherhood . <p> " Sorry for waking you up , " I said . <p> She turned back to me , and her face emerged from the shadows so abruptly it was as if she had leapt toward me . I ducked behind the door . This was not a conscious act . My body , drunken and shy , simply reacted . And yet the expression which settled onto Mamu 's face then seemed unutterably sad . Her teeth carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter to me " she said . <p> Mamu spent the day before my departure preparing borscht . The windows fogged with a bouquet of onions fried in chicken fat , celery , carrots , peppers , the subtle acrid undercurrent of beets . I 'd never eaten borscht . That was the joke . From time to time , I shambled to the kitchen to fetch tea from the porcelain kettle that stood , perpetually steeping , on the narrow ledge between oven and sink . I paused to watch Mamu core the eyes out of a potato . <p> " She is sad , " Mamu said quietly . " Are you sad ? " <p> " Yes " I said . <p> She raised her hands , as if to make a gesture , and her fingertips came to rest on my cheekbone . I could smell the dirt and onions on her hands , which were beautiful , pink and swollen , the backs laced with delicate veins . " Yes . Sad . " <p> After dinner , we drank vodka . Mamu put some folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach me the rudiments of a polka . Then Mamu rose from her seat , handed me her softer body , which moved with a surprising buoyancy . <p> And later , piled into her room , Mamu pulled a silver punch bowl from beneath her bed , filled with family photos . There she was , thirty years ago , on a youth brigade outing , a pretty , stylish teenager in a uniform and a beret . She looked at me as I looked at the photos , leaned against my shoulder . Her face sang out the same caption again and again : This is me , young and beautiful ! <p> There were other photos she wanted me to see : Basha looking darling in a white pinafore , nestled on the lap of her stepfather , fending off sleep with a gummy smile . Mamu set her hand on my thigh . She leaned toward me . For a moment , I thought she would kiss me , that her red , smoky mouth would seek mine . But I was missing it . The person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her lap , her youth , her motherhood , her daughter , the men she loved , all tumbling onto the rug , face up , face down , the bowl used for storing them showing streaks of tarnish under the amber light . <p> Basha clambered off the bed and went down onto her forearms , pushing her backside into the air . She was quite drunk . <p> " Do you like the way I look like this ? " <p> It took me a moment to gather my voice , and Basha laughed , as we should wish all women to laugh , at the fallacy of their depravity , at the idea that anything , in the end , can disgust them . " I want anal love " she said , making the word sound French and exquisite . <p> Is it cruel for me to repeat her words like this ? Should I lie , make them somehow prettier , more poetic ? But this is what she said . This is the form her desire took at that moment . Or perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degradation , some form of going-away present . <p> " Are you sure ? " I said . <p> " Put some jelly . " Basha sucked in a little breath and pushed back . The heel of her palms pressed down , and her arms tensed . I braced my heel against the radiator . The knuckles of her spine buckled softly . Her face was pressed to the rug , and her eyes were closed , and she was smiling . <p> I could hear Mamu in the bathroom , making her ablutions before bed . <p> " We should stop , " I said . <p> Basha shook her head : No , it feels good , but it hurts , let 's keep trying . <p> There were other women around , more suitable , in baggy sweaters and glasses much like mine , their clocks fizzing away . But I was in no shape to cooperate with them . The last thing I wanted was a woman who actually understood me . Once back in the States , that is , face to face with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aegis of my own bloated heroism . I knew I was being played . But that , too , is a part of love . I missed Basha . I missed her Old World manners , which made me feel debonair . I missed Mamu 's greasy borscht and her confused longing . I missed their warm little apartment , where I was always the center of attention . <p> Katowice was made new by May . The buildings , ash-streaked and rotten in winter , bloomed with mongrel hyacinth . Sun baked the mud to dirt . Shirts fluttered brightly on laundry lines , and kids kicked soccer balls in the courtyards , and couples in long shadows strolled the plaza at dusk . With the windows thrown open , the breeze carried the fragrance of broiled chicken and baked sesame seeds , the sweet reek of garbage . <p> And the women ! The women of Katowice unpeeled themselves , plum-titted , translucent , with cheeks a mile square and big sleepy asses , teenagers in sullen halter-tops , business molls slotted into rayon suits , college students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the girls of the meat shops , whose flanks and chops sweated in glass cases , whose beauty hid beneath tiers of acne , who handled the sweet , smoky kielbasa as if handling thick lovers-brisk , worldly imitations of sex ! <p> Each morning , Basha and Mamu bustled off to work , while I got up and pretended to write . I was hard at work on what was  --  to my knowledge-the longest outline in academic history : 471 pages , not counting footnotes . At noon , I fixed myself a breakfast of eggs , sugar-cured bacon , rolls pan-fried in the fat . Then I settled down for a nap , listening to the yips of the kids on the playground below . It was all quite bohemian . I smoked Walet cigarettes , at eighty-five groszy a pack , which tasted of cloves and dung . <p> In the evenings , I talked literature with Mamu . She 'd studied philology at the university , and devoured the Western Canon . Die Blechtrummel was an after-dinner mint to her . I bounced a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deboned and neatly skinned . Basha preferred TV , which consisted , in large part , of American sitcoms dubbed into Polish by a single droning monotone . <p> Aside from sexual congress , during which her mind and body seemed open to the fluctuations of experience , she remained determinedly opaque . She was not dumb , or shallow . She had mastered five languages and spoke each of them beautifully . There seemed no sound her tongue could n't make . She simply mistrusted the depth of her feelings . <p> But even our glorious sex life wilted under the rigor of permanence . Basha kept me on what the behavioralists would recognize as a variable reinforcement schedule . She wanted to be cuddled , fawned over , stroked like a child . If I pushed for more , she claimed to be sore , or tired . I could n't figure this out . Where had the wanton accomplice of our early days gone ? Once a week or so , I staged a blowout , on some despicable pretext , so as to storm out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks of the Valia River , whose slick tides were the color of venous blood ; so as to return to the balm of her negligent love , which was for me like floating in a warm sea . <p> Toward the end of July , an old professor , who had known me in a steadier time , tracked me down . He needed a lecturer for fall . The job itself was no great shakes . But his intention was clear . He was offering me reentry . A decent paycheck . Enough respect to take another pass at my dissertation . " What are you doing over there anyway ? " he said . <p> Basha remained unconvinced . " You wo n't leave , " she said . " You love me too much . " She refused to imagine that I had another life , beyond her beauty , thick with the troubled symptoms of adulthood . <p> " You can come to the States , " I said . " Like we talked about . " <p> For all her brave claims of a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we let the weeks drift by , watched the dour sun elongate the days . The cedars shed elegant white scrolls along the aimless paths where we went to eat ice cream . <p> On the eve of my departure , I took Basha to Katowice 's toniest bistro . We ordered coq au vin and tenderloin braised in anisette . I had hoped to take a last stroll on the plaza , but by the end of the meal , Basha 's complexion looked like cement . She barely touched her food . Back at home , Mamu prepared her tea and got her to take aspirin and to lie down . <p> I finished up packing . When I came to bed , Basha was staring out the window , at the torn clouds . Her face was the kind of thing one sees in the classical wing of a museum : beauty as a force of history . Her robe rode up the back of her thighs . I had it in mind that we might make love . That was what my great , quivering cliche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the bed and curled around her from behind and nuzzled against her bottom . " It 's our last night together , " I said . <p> Basha shook her head . <p> " Honey , " I whispered . " Please . " <p> " Do n't , " she said softly . " No . " <p> " I just want to love you . " I pressed myself against her . <p> This was the wrong move . I knew that . But I felt , at that moment , as if I had nothing else to fall back on . Our affair-our grand drama of abandonment and reclamation-had run aground . It was time for our bodies to leap to the rescue . <p> Basha , for all her evasions , was ahead of me there . She understood that the body can only express wishes . It can not undo facts . " No , " she said . " Leave me alone . " <p> What sort of comment was this ? Leave me alone ? We were lovers . This was our last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs . Her skin seemed to grow more and more pale , as if she were dissolving into the sheets . But I did n't want her to go yet . My hand reached for the stem of her neck . <p> Basha began to weep . " Stop , " she said . " Do n't touch me . " <p> " Does that hurt ? " I pressed at the warm cords of muscle . " Am I hurting you ? " <p> Suddenly Basha was kicking at me , the robe riding up until I could see the cleft of her ass , her lovely white halves tensing , the fine hairs and skin darkening to blue in the furrow . I knew what I wanted to do . It was perfectly dear . I grabbed her hips . <p> Basha 's elbow swung back , knocked me in the mouth , and I could taste blood now , a good taste , sweet and full of ruin . Basha wriggled away and got up from the bed . I might have leapt up , pursued her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the frosted glass of the door , Mamu hovering just outside . <p> " Run away , " I said . " That 's right , run away . " <p> " You 're the one , " Basha sobbed . She opened the door and collapsed into her mother , and the two of them stood there for a minute . Then they moved off , like a pair of wounded soldiers , and I heard the door to Mamu 's room swing shut . <p> I waited for my breathing to subside , then went and stood outside the door . I could hear the two of them whispering in soft drifts of Polish . I opened the door , but neither of them bothered to turn . Mamu reached to straighten the compress she had laid along her daughter 's brow . Basha whimpered , in the manner of a child struggling toward sleep . She held the hem of Mamu 's skirt in her fist . And I understood , now , why Mamu had never resented my presence : she knew Basha would never forsake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Basha 's room an hour later . I was in the kitchen , staring at the empty courtyard below . She smiled politely and took a Petit Coeur from the pack stashed in the cupboard . " Maybe you like sandwich for the trip ? " <p> " That 's okay , " I said . <p> But already she was reaching into the fridge , removing a hunk of cheese , some kielbasa wrapped in foil , pulling a knife from the magnetized strip above my head . The skin of her hands was like beautiful pink paper . <p> " She 's asleep ? " <p> Mamu nodded . <p> " Maybe I should sleep on the couch ? " <p> Mamu shrugged . She sliced the kielbasa and the cheese and layered them on the roll . " You have made all your suitcases ? " <p> I nodded . I could feel the swell of my fat lip . <p> " I guess I might have hurt her , " I said . " I was pretty angry . You know , having to leave and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mamu gazed at me . Smoke drifted from her nose . She had known this was coming , after all . Men were people who left ; they were not dependable . Their other charms , their money and their words and their cocks , these were only temporary compensations . Her daughter was finally learning this . <p> Later , there would be another soggy goodbye , lurid with airport hope . And later still , the letters and phone calls , which slipped to hollow , fainter in their promise , until they vanished altogether . Basha was not the sort to cling , not the sort I might dial up in the small hours , with a bit too much wine and night in me , to make sure she was still somehow stuck . There is a point you reach , I mean , when you are just something bad that happened to someone else . <p> " I 'm sorry , " I said . " I 'm sorry for everything . " <p> But Mamu was n't angry . It would be no easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , stepped around the table and gathered me into her arms , and I buried my head in her bosom , which smelled of smoke and laundry soap and ten thousand meals , and began to sob , for Basha , for Mamu , for all of us in the suffering of our desires . <p> Author Affiliation
