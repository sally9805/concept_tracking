Prologue Bayside Hospital San Francisco , California Room 316 Friday , February 13 NOW They think I 'm going to die . I hear it in their whispered words . They think I ca n't hear them , but I can , and I 'm listening to every single syllable they utter . " No ! " I want to scream . " I 'm alive . I 'm not giving up . I will fight back . " But I ca n't speak . Ca n't utter one damned word . My voice is stilled , just as my eyes wo n't open . Try as I might , I ca n't lift the lids . All I know is that I 'm lying in a hospital bed , and I know that I 'm barely alive . I hear the whispers , the comments , the soft-soled shoes on the floor . Everyone thinks I 'm in a coma , unable to hear them , to respond , but I know what 's going on . I just ca n't move , ca n't communicate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition is bad , they claim . I understand the terms ruptured spleen , broken pelvis , concussion , brain trauma , but , damn it , I can hear them ! I feel the stretch of skin at the back of my hand where the IV pulls ; smell the scents of perfume , medicine , and resignation . The stethoscope is ice cold , the blood pressure cuff too tight , and I try like hell to show some sign that I 'm aware , that I can feel . I try to move , just lift a finger or let out a long moan , but Ica n't . It scares me to death . I 'm hooked up to machines that monitor my heartbeat and breathing and God only knows what else . Not that it does any good . All the high-tech machines that are tracking body functions are n't providing the hospital staff with any hope or clue that I know what 's going on . I 'm trapped in my body , and it 's a living hell . Once again I strain ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to point at whoever next enters the room . Up , I think , raise the tip up off the bedsheets . The effort is painful ... so hard . Is n't anyone watching the damned monitor ? I must be registering an elevated pulse , an accelerated heart rate , some damn thing ! But no . All that effort . Wasted . Worse yet , I 've heard the gossip ; some of the nurses think I would be better off dead ... but they do n't know the truth . I hear footsteps . Heavier than the usual . And the vague scent of lingering cigar smoke . The doctor ! He 's been in before . " Let 's take a look , shall we ? " he says to whomever it is who 's accompanied him , probably the nurse with the cold hands and cheery , irritating voice . " She 's still not responsive . " Sure enough , the chipper one . " I have n't seen any positive change in her vitals . In fact ... well , see for yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her voice sound so resigned ? Where 's the fake , peppy inspiration in her tone ? " Hmmm , " the doctor says in his baritone voice . Then his hands are on me . Gently touching and poking , lifting my eyelid and shining a harsh beam directly into my lens . It 's blinding , and surely my body will show some response . A blink or flinch or ... " Looks like you 're right , " he says , turning off the light and backing away from the bed . " She 's declining rapidly . " No ! That 's wrong ! I 'm here . I 'm alive . I 'm going to get better ! I ca n't believe what I 'm hearing , and should be hyperventilating , should be going into cardiac arrest at the very words . Ca n't you see that I 'm stressing ? Do n't the damned monitors show that I 'm alive and aware and that I want to live ? Oh God , how I want to live ! " The family 's been asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has . " My family ? They 've already put me in the grave ? That ca n't be right ! I do n't believe it . I 'm still alive , for God 's sake . How did I come to this ? But I know . All too vividly I can remember every moment of my life and the events leading up to this very second . " Doctor ? " the nurse whispers . " Tell them twenty-four hours , " he says solemnly . " Maybe less . " (
