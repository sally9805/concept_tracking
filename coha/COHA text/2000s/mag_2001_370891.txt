The year was 1988 , and the U.S. AIDS epidemic was in full bloom . Angry homosexual groups were blaming the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) for the glacial pace of government research , drug testing and drug approval . Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the agency since 1984 , was singled out for attack , branded a " Nazi " and a " murderer , " and hanged in effigy . <P> Other government officials might have hunkered down . But Fauci decided to hear his critics out . Meeting with AIDS activists in San Francisco , he was introduced to a 34-year-old schoolteacher who explained that a maze of outdated government regulations was preventing his use of a drug that could save his eyesight , failing because of an AIDS-related infection . <P> " Here was this guy who was n't confrontational , who did n't shove a banner in my face , but had this terrible dilemma , " Fauci told the San Francisco Chronicle . " You ca n't be a human being without having that move you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Fauci . Returning to Washington , he set out to mobilize the government against the disease . He successfully lobbied the Food and Drug Administration to make AIDS drugs more widely available . He set up speedier protocols for testing new AIDS drugs . He invited AIDS patients to participate in the NIAID advisory process . Practically overnight , he became one of the leading advocates of AIDS causes and a hero to the gay community . <P> Indeed , when former President George Bush in 1989 asked Fauci to become director of the entire National Institutes of Health , he turned down the prestigious job primarily because , as director of NIAID , he was too involved  --  professionally and personally  --  in tackling the AIDS epidemic . <P> In the years since , Fauci has set a frenetic pace , often working an 80-hour week . He runs NIAID with a hands-on style and , as former NIH director Harold Varmus once commented , " an iron fist . " With Fauci at the helm , NIAID 's annual budget soared from $320 million in 1984 to $2.4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson , who calls Fauci " one of the most passionate HIV/AIDS researchers in the world today . " <P> Far more than an excellent administrator , Fauci modestly admits to " wearing several hats . " He helps design and oversees large clinical trials of experimental AIDS drugs , conducts research in his own institute laboratory , publishes reams of scientific papers , makes weekly rounds of AIDS patients at an NIH clinical center and travels the world to spread the gospel of AIDS prevention and treatment . " It 's almost as if I were trained for this epidemic , " says Fauci , who earned a medical degree from Cornell and has specialized in infectious diseases and immunology . <P> Thanks in no small part to Fauci 's prodigious efforts , AIDS deaths in the U.S. have dropped from 50,610 in 1995 to 16,273 in 1999 . But the situation is still critical . Forty thousand new AIDS cases are reported annually in the U.S. , and new findings at NIAID have shown that even after extended treatment with the strongest antiviral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus replicates persistently .
