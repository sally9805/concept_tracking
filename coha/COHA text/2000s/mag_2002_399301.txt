Daniel Schumann was scared . Not frightened , not apprehensive , but downright , bone-chilling scared . It was 6:30 on a May evening . and Arlington National Cemetery was about to close . Two or three hundred tourists had stuck around to enjoy the warm spring Virginia weather and watch the changing , of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknowns . The man they would be watching was U.S. Army Specialist Daniel Schumann , 21 . " Maybe there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schumann says , " but it felt like a thousand . I was afraid I was going to mess 111 ) in front of the crowd . " Schumann had other reasons to be concerned , for this was his test walk , or " Bolo , " at the Tomb . If Schumann did well he would be assigned to a relief and do many more walks . If he messed up , it would be back to the drills . " I was scared , " says Schumann , an Eagle Scout . " But later , it strong sense of pride took over and the jitters went away : " &gt; Schumann and Specialist Paul Basso , also an Eagle Scout , have used their Scout skills to earn membership in one of the elite units in the United States Army , the Sentinels of the Tomb of the Unknowns . Highest of Standards There are only 27 sentinelsthree reliefs of nine men each . They are members of the Third Infantry Regiment , " The Old Guard , " which dates back to George Washington 's time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a spotless record , intimate knowledge of the uniform standards and history of the Tomb and impeccable military bearing . " The basic progress through Scouting has had a great impact on my success as a soldier , " says Basso , a military policeman . " From the start , Scouts are taught respect , honor and service . I remember the first Scout meeting I attended , I was taught how to fold a flag and the proper customs and courtesies . These skills and values are exercised now more than ever at ceremonies here at the Tomb . " Tomb Quarters , where sentinels eat , sleep and rest between walks , is a busy place when the cemetery is open . Besides flag-raising and retreat , sentinels participate in 20 or more wreath-laying ceremonies a day , as well as 23 guard changes , several public briefings and tours of the Tomb Quarters . Tomb Tests Six months after joining the Old Guard , Basso and Schumann volunteered for sentinel duty . Right away they were challenged by a two-week , 18-hour-a-day evaluation period designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were required to memorize the history of the Tomb , learn the Uniform Standards and practice the Manual of Arms to perfection . " Most candidates drop out in the first two weeks of evaluation , " Sergeant of the Guard Frederick Geary says . Every sentinel knows that the first unknown soldier , a veteran of World War I , was interred at Arlington National Cemetery on Nov. 11 , 1921 . Unknowns from World War II and the Korean War followed on May 30 , 1958 , and a Vietnam veteran was added May 28 , 1984 . ( Later , tests revealed this man 's identity . Thanks to the advances in forensic science , it is unlikely there will ever be another unknown soldier . ) After 90 days of training , specialists Schumann and Basso took and passed a written " full rotation " test on their knowledge . They then had 10 days to cram for their " Badge Test . " Those who pass this written test join a fraternity of only 502 soldiers since 1958 who have qualified to serve at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duty A sentinel 's day starts early . After forming up at the Selfidge Gate at 5:30 a.m. and marching to Tomb Quarters , each member of the relief prepares his " Ready Rack , " which contains hat , gloves , sunglasses , a ceremonial belt and other gear . Tomb Quarters has a steam press to iron dress blue uniforms before each shift , and a fully stocked kitchen . Each relief mans Tomb Quarters for 25 hours every third day . They seldom get a chance to take a break . Days off are spent with personal responsibilities such as cleaning uniforms , shining shoes and polishing brass . Taking to the Mat When guarding the Tomb , the sentinel crosses a 63-foot rubber  --  surfaced walkway , called " the mat , " in exactly 21 steps . He then faces the tomb for 21 seconds , turns again and pauses an additional 21 seconds before retracing his steps . The " 21 " is symbolic of the highest salute accorded to dignitaries in military and state ceremonies .

He will issue a warning if anyone attempts to enter the restricted area around the Tomb but will first halt and bring his rifle to port arms . " That happens every day , " Sergeant Geary says . The guard changes every hour on the hour Oct. 1 to March 15 and every half-hour March 16 to Sept. 30 . At night , the guard changes every hour regardless of weather or season .

" Tomb sentinels are the most visible soldiers in the U.S. Army to the American public , " says Maj. Gen. James T Jackson , Commander of the Military District of Washington . " Over 4 million visitors a year are exposed to these soldiers , whose level of discipline and dedication to detail is remarkable . " The Job 's Rewards " The most rewarding thing about this job is seeing the look of satisfaction in the eyes of the public , especially the veterans , " Specialist Basso says . " It makes me feel that all the time and effort is worth it . It 's a great feeling . " Specialist Basso 's most memorable moment at the tomb : " It was July 2001 , during the week that thousands of Scouts were in town for the national jamboree . It was just after the guard change , and I was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Scout troop . It was very hot , and I was just going though the routine sort of tired and fatigued . " I heard the command to present arms and halfway through the playing of taps , something struck me weird .

" I remember thinking , what a great group of young men , all doing the right thing . I stood a little straighter that day .
