The Brooklyn housing projects were deserted as Eva <br> Patterson took a shortcut through the buildings , trying <br> not to get drenched in the pouring rain . It was unusually <br> cold for early fall , and all she had on was the corduroy <br> skirt and Salvation Army sweater she 'd been wearing <br> when Rasheena kicked her out of their tenement apartment , but the temperature was the last thing on her mind as her eyes scanned the crime- ridden buildings in search of a safe place to go . <br> " Sheena , please . . . " Their neighbor Iris had butt in on <br> the earlier drama as Rasheena cursed her daughter out <br> like she was a grown woman . Iris had puffed out her <br> cheeks and held her breath between tokes of weed . " Stunt , stop <br> fuckin ' trippin ' . Eva 's a good girl . And young as she is , I know <br> you ai n't . . . putting her out in the . . . street this time of . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , and Rasheena drunk was somebody <br> altogether different than Rasheena high . The high Rasheena <br> would have been sitting in a corner somewhere . Getting her nod <br> on and leaving Eva the hell alone.The drunk Rasheena had stood <br> over her daughter giving her a grimy look that said Eva could kiss <br> her ass . <br> " What ? ! ? " Rasheena had turned to Iris . " Fourteen is grown ! <br> Sheeit . . . my ass was on the ave gettin ' tricked when I was <br> twelve . Who the fuck took care of me ? " <br> Rasheena slurped a mouthful of Goose straight from the <br> bottle , then chased it with a long swig of cranberry juice and <br> explained . " Look , I. If you lie you steal , and Eva is a thief . A <br> goddamn thief . There 's two things I ai n't ' bout to watch in my <br> own goddamn house . My duji and my dick ! Ya feel me ? Eva <br> grown enough to fuck with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown enough to let the doorknob hit'er in the ass on <br> the way out ! " <br> " Well damnnn , " Iris toked the blunt and muttered under <br> her breath . " Y'all the ones who got her started on that shit in <br> the first place . . . " <br> Eva had just sat there crying inside and looking forty instead <br> of fourteen . She had tried to dip in Rasheena 's stash , but she 'd <br> been sick all day and could n't go out and make no money . Eva <br> hated stealing from her mother . These days she hated taking <br> anything from anybody , but she had a hungry monkey on her <br> back . And Iris had it right . Eva was n't responsible for putting <br> herself on the gutter path to drug abuse , but neither did she <br> have what it took to get off of it . She had n't gotten a hit all day , <br> and just thinking about having to get out on those cold streets <br> was enough to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry I got you , " Eva 's stepfather Jahden put his hand <br> up to his mouth and whispered . He winked and grinned as Eva <br> slunk into the tiny room she 'd once shared with her cousin <br> Fuego , whose street- translated name was Fiyah . Eva missed her <br> cousin real bad . But Fiyah 's mother had gotten out of rehab a <br> couple of years earlier and he 'd gone back to Harlem to live <br> with her . Even with all the grimy things they 'd done together <br> Fiyah was down for her through thick and thin , and Eva <br> wished she could have escaped to Harlem with him . <br> " And do n't you take a damn thing outta here that I bought <br> you ! " Rasheena screamed from the kitchen . Eva sighed . The <br> only thing she was interested in taking from the room was the <br> most important thing . <br> Her works . <br> Jahden grabbed her thin arm as she headed out the front <br> door . <br> " Hold on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid- level drug dealer , <br> Jahden specialized in pushing smack while most trap boys were <br> busy trading that rock . His hand slid around Eva 's narrow <br> shoulders then fell to the small of her back . Eva stiffened as his <br> fingers crept down the lump of her ass and massaged her <br> cheeks . A cold sweat broke out all over her skin . If my real father <br> was here Jah would n't be touching me like this , she cried inside . <br> This nasty pervert woulda been bodied by now . Eva bit her <br> tongue , trying not to throw up . Jahden liked to cold sex her . <br> He would do things to her that Eva 's young body just was n't <br> ready to handle . There was no end to his twisted demands , and <br> earlier in the day he had forced Eva to sit on the floor and <br> watch him fuck Rasheena from the back while Rasheena got in <br> Iris 's pussy at the same time . <br> " Check me out , Eva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> gyrated and pumped like a steam engine . Eva shuddered . Her <br> mother was rotating her head in circles and lapping nookie <br> juice like that shit came in thirty- one flavors . Jahden laughed at <br> the look of revulsion on Eva 's face , then screamed on her as she <br> closed her eyes and tried to escape the horrible scene playing <br> out in front of her . " Bitch open ya goddamn eyes ! You betta be <br> a student and pay attention , dammit ! " <br> Eva had just sat there and cried . She was traumatized and <br> sickened . She wanted to stick a knife in Jahden 's neck . The <br> same way he 'd stuck a fearsome needle in her neck a year ago <br> and turned her into the scared , humiliated shell she was today . <br> Although Rasheena had starved her child almost to skin and <br> bones and done things to Eva that even the lowest dog- mother <br> would never consider , Jahden was the real reason her life was so <br> fucked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd <br> promise herself that she 'd kick dope cold turkey before she let <br> him rape her or get her high again , but her greatest fear had become <br> her greatest joy , and Eva was helpless . <br> Rasheena , who had held Eva down the first time Jahden shot <br> her up , and who had then stood by and watched as her boy - <br> friend busted her young daughter 's cherry , had been acting real <br> jealous . She got mad whenever it looked like Jahden would <br> rather fuck Eva than fuck her , and she put her foot down and <br> demanded that from that day on Eva had to pay for her skag <br> with cold hard gwap just like every other fiend- head customer . <br> Desperate , young Eva had taken to the streets to earn her <br> drug money the only way she knew how . On her knees and on <br> her back . She 'd been beaten by strange men , raped , stabbed , <br> and almost strangled . She had cried out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done to deserve such a dark , treacherous <br> life . But as usual , there were no answers for Eva . There <br> was only more destitution and misery . Only fear and more <br> pain . And right now , standing next to Jahden while he rubbed <br> all over her ass , she was hurting . Real bad . Hurting and scared . <br> Seeing the disgust on her face Jahden grinned and reached in <br> his shirt pocket . He passed her a tiny foil- wrapped package and <br> squeezed her fingers when she tried to take it . <br> " I got what you need , baby girl . " He cupped his dick and <br> licked his lips . " See how cool I am ? Tonight I'ma let you get it <br> for free . " <br> Eva burned with rage , but he was right . She feared what he <br> had , but she needed it too . She snatched it greedily and fled . <br> Downstairs , Eva 's nose was runny and her entire body <br> ached . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , <br> and it was n't just from anger or from her mother 's cruel behavior . <br> Rasheena had once been a top clothing model for a highly <br> successful designer , but these days she was a common needle <br> fiend who put her man , her drink , and her drugs way ahead of <br> her only child . She had also been an extremely beautiful and <br> intelligent black woman who could have gone far in life . Tall <br> and shapely , with skin the color of brown sugar , she had wide <br> eyes , stunning lips , and hips like sweet chocolate milkshakes . <br> Back in the day she used to be known as the finest chick in <br> Brownsville , but a fast life and a series of grimy men had <br> proven more than Rasheena could handle . She 'd traded her exotic <br> beauty for one too many heroin trips , and these days she <br> scrambled with the low- life Jahden because he not only paid <br> her rent , but he also kept her head right . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the <br> drunken rages Rasheena flew into always cut Eva deep . Juiced , <br> Rasheena would wrap an extension cord around her fist and <br> whip her daughter until Eva 's skin split open and she passed <br> out from the pain . Eva 's starving body was a canvas of thick , <br> ugly scars and fresh bruises that she 'd picked until they were <br> oozing , infected sores . Her stomach , ass , and back would be so <br> cut open that her wounds bled through and pussed over and <br> glued her undergarments to her skin . Her arms and legs had <br> their fair share of crisscrossed cuts and welts too , but Rasheena <br> had learned to chill on those areas after the school social worker <br> got on her case and told her she 'd make sure her black ass got <br> locked up the next time she saw Eva with a fresh belt mark . <br> It was hard for Eva to admit that she would rather see her <br> mother mainline heroin than guzzle vodka and gin , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides , Eva understood <br> duji . She respected that shit . Liquor was something else <br> though . A smack head could find any old corner and cop a <br> quiet nod , but a drunk usually got loud and abusive . Drunks <br> liked to bully the weak , and that was Rasheena to a tee . <br> Eva dodged rain puddles and hunched her narrow shoulders <br> against the cold . It was after midnight , and the sixteen- story <br> concrete towers of Howard Houses Projects were a mixture of <br> illumination and darkness . Rain curled Eva 's silky hair and <br> drenched her down to her bruised skin . Shivering , she tightened <br> her grip on the tiny package she 'd gotten from Jahden , <br> then ducked her head and moved down the walkways as fast as <br> she could . <br> She was close to building 420 when the same pain she 'd felt <br> earlier slammed into her again . This one hurt so bad it <br> snatched her breath and doubled her over in her tracks . She <br> tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the agony <br> clawed at her gut and she fell to the wet ground , busting open <br> a partially healed sore on her knee . <br> " Please , God , " Eva begged . Her nose was running freely now , <br> and she was totally sick . " God , please help me . " Rainwater <br> mixed with tears fell into her mouth . Eva was scared . She felt <br> like a train had hit her and she needed to find someplace safe <br> fast . The wind screamed and she clenched her fist tight , holding <br> on to her precious package . She crawled over to a seesaw <br> and rested her cheek on the painted wood . Her knee throbbed <br> and her stomach felt pressurized , like she needed to take a real <br> big shit . <br> Eva fought the urge , and as the wind screamed all she could <br> think about was getting someplace dry where she could get herself <br> right . She was a young girl but experience had taught her <br> what would happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> drug dens to do her thing . Like a lot of chicks , she might come <br> out of one of those joints either raped or beaten , if she made it <br> out at all . She gripped the small square of foil in her fist and <br> pressed on . She was alone and afraid , jonesing in the night , and <br> moments later she stood staring up at the windows of building <br> 420 . She knew people there . Her girl Sherri from junior high <br> lived on the third floor with her crippled grandmother . Eva had <br> come up on the streets with Sherri and a real cool dude named <br> Reem Raw , a true friend who would fight any niggah in the <br> street who so much as looked at either one of them wrong . But <br> Reem had moved up to Harlem , and Sherri . . . Eva gazed at <br> her friend 's window where a light shone from a bedroom . She <br> saw movement . She took a step toward the building , but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed her hands of <br> all the shiesty things she and Eva had done together . Eva moved <br> closer and the curtains fell closed . A shadow retreated from the <br> window and the light went out . <br> Friendless , Eva glanced around , searching for a spot . She was <br> tempted to take her chances and run up in a project stairwell <br> and get right real quick , but on a night like this there would be <br> more predatory winos and pipe heads on the stairs than there <br> were people living in the apartments . She would probably go <br> into a nod and come out of it dead . <br> A large basketball court was on her right and a parking lot was <br> on her left . Eva thought about breaking into a parked car , but she <br> did n't have the strength . She did n't have the time neither . <br> Suddenly she thought of something better . <br> Drunk Mister James . <br> Drunk Nasty- Ass Mister James . <br> Clenching her silver package , she scurried along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the building 's rough <br> brick exterior . She hesitated at the mouth of the ramp that led <br> down to the underground laundrymat and decided to take her <br> chances . Sometimes Drunk Mister James was too lit to lock up <br> on the weekends . Closing time would come and go , and the <br> old man would be off , who the hell knew where , sipping on his <br> cheap wine . <br> With her dope safe and dry in her left hand , Eva 's bony fingers <br> skimmed the rain- slick banister as she descended deeper <br> down the ramp . Step by step , terror crept over her . Pitch blackness <br> waited for her at the bottom , and probably a piper and a <br> stray cat or two as well . <br> " Oh . . . my God . . . please help me , " Eva moaned . Another <br> pain seized her and she almost peed right there . She pressed her <br> knees together , feeling hot and nauseous . Like she needed to <br> shit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved <br> deeper down the ramp , the wind kicking her in the ass . If she <br> could just get someplace dry , she would be all right . She did n't <br> really care about the pain . She lived with pain on the regular . It <br> was the dope sickness that was killing her . <br> A sudden surge of vomit splashed at the back of her throat <br> and Eva flung herself down the ramp . Her jones was riding her <br> bad . Desperation wiped away her fear and she was ready to <br> fight . If something bad was waiting to hurt her at the bottom <br> of the ramp then it better be jonesing harder than she was . <br> She stepped deeper into the darkness and stood before the <br> closed door . Her hand slipped on the wet knob as she twisted <br> it frantically . She almost could n't believe it when the door <br> swung open and she was inside an empty foyer that was as big <br> as her apartment . She was greeted by the smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rank old <br> piss . <br> Continues ... <p>
