Devil 's Corner Chapter One Vicki Allegretti always wondered what it would feel like to look into the barrel of a loaded gun , and now she knew . The gun was a black Glock , nine millimeter , and it was aimed at her right eye . Vicki observed the scene out-of-body , as if it were happening to a girl with a better sense of humor . Wonder if black guns make you look thinner , she thought . Holding her point-blank was an African-American teenager with cornrows , who looked as terrified as she was . He looked about fourteen years old , showing just a shadow of a mustache , and his brown eyes were jittery with fear . He kept shifting his weight in his big Iversons , standing tall in baggy jeans and a red satin Sixers jacket . He 'd frozen in place when he 'd come downstairs and found Vicki standing there , his shocked expression suggesting that he had n't shot many lawyers . At least not his share . " You do n't want to do this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The kid 's long fingers trembled on the gun 's crosshatched grip , and his other hand cradled a bulge underneath his jacket , as if he were hiding something . She had evidently interrupted a burglary by a rookie . Unfortunately , the Glock was an all-star . " I 'm an assistant U.S. Attorney . " " Wha ? " The teenager swallowed hard , his eyes flickering with confusion . " I work for the Justice Department . Killing me is like killing a cop . " Okay , it was n't technically true , but it should have been . " If you shoot me , they 'll try you as an adult . They 'll go for the death penalty . " " Get your hands up ! " The teenager 's eyes flared , and he wet his lips with a large , dry tongue . " Okay , sure . Relax . " Vicki raised her hands slowly , fighting the instinct to run . He 'd shoot her in the back if she did ; the living room was so small , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could talk her way out of it . " Listen , you do n't want to upgrade a burglary charge to murder . The stuff that 's under your jacket is yours now . Take it and run . " " Shut up ! " So Vicki did , holding her hands up , her thoughts racing ahead . None of this was supposed to be happening . She had come to the row house tonight to meet a confidential informant in a minor straw purchase case . The meeting was to be so routine that Bob Morton , an ATF case agent , was finishing his cigarette outside by the car . Could she stall until Morty got here ? And where was her CI now ? " Jay-Boy ! " the kid yelled up the stairwell , panicky . " Jay ! " Vicki noted the nickname . She could identify every zit on the kid 's face . She was n't getting out of this alive . She could n't wait for Morty . She had to do something . " Jay ! Where you at ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vicki seized her only chance . She grabbed the barrel of the Glock and twisted it upward . At the same instant , Morty walked through the screen door and the whole world exploded . " Morty , watch out ! " Vicki shouted . The Glock fired , jerking convulsively . The barrel seared her palms . The shot split her eardrums . The teenager wrenched the gun back , yanking her off her feet . Simultaneously , another shot rang out . Not from the Glock . Too close to be from Morty 's gun . Vicki 's throat caught and she looked past the teenager . A man in a goatee and a black coat was shooting at Morty from the stairs . " No ! " Vicki screamed , grappling for the Glock . She glimpsed Morty as he fell backward , grimacing with pain . His arms flew open like a marionette 's , throwing the gun from his hand . " NO ! " Vicki screamed louder , as the shooter on the stairs kept firing . A second gunshot , then a third and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripstop of his down jacket , jerking his fallen body on impact . Vicki 's heart hiccupped with fear and she yanked harder on the gun . The teenager punched her in the stomach , and she doubled over , gasping for breath . She released the Glock and hit back . She connected with his Sixers jacket and held on for dear life . " Let go ! " the teenager shouted , punching Vicki again and again . She flailed and after a solid body blow , crumpled to the floor , the wind sucked out of her . As she fell , she heard the faraway scream of a police siren and the kid shouting , scared , " Jay , we got ta go ! Jay ! " Vicki lay doubled over on her side , her body paralyzed with pain . Tears blurred her vision . She could n't collect her thoughts . She heard footsteps and panting , then a chamber being ratcheted back . She opened wet eyes into the two bottomless black wells of a sawed-off gun . Hot smoke curled from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aiming the weapon was the shooter with the goatee . My God , no . Vicki rolled over in a last effort to save herself . " Do n't do it , Jay , she 's a cop ! " the teenager screamed . Then , " No ! Get it ! Hurry ! " Suddenly they were scrambling to pick things up off the floor . Whatever they 'd stolen must have fallen out of the Sixers coat . " Leave it go , Teeg ! We got ta go ! " The shooter was already sprinting away , his hands full . The teenager bolted after him , jumping over Morty and out the front door , leaving the row house suddenly quiet . Morty . Vicki rolled back over and struggled to her feet , stumbling across the living room to him . " Morty ! " she called , anguished , when she reached his side . He was lying on his back , his arms still flung wide , his blue eyes fluttering . " Morty , can you hear me ? Morty ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat features had gone slack and a sheen of perspiration coated his forehead and wet his sandy hair ...
