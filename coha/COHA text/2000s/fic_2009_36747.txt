<br> Song of the Sigue <br> <br> They touched the sigue coast at dusk , just as the ice was cracking . Standing on the slippery top deck as the massive ice- drilling submarine churned toward shore , Sorykah Minuit inhaled , taking the cold ocean air deep into her lungs . It felt so good to be outside after weeks below sea , working cheek by jowl with sixty filthy , sweat- stained miners and their collective , tactile reek . The air sang down her throat and pierced her lungs , but she welcomed the discomfort . It helped to clear her head of melancholy and milk- fog . For a moment it seemed that the cold would solidify around her and crack apart her carefully wrought shell , releasing her from the prison of her secrecy  --  but it did not . <br> The helmsman sounded the docking horn . A long , low peal vibrated the metal deck beneath her feet . Frigid brine sluiced over the Nimbus ' s hull as it rose , its imposing bulk breasting the waves like the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of apricots glistened atop the water ; heat splayed against an icy sky . Soon , the color would fade and night emerge , liquid indigo turning the snow to charcoal . Southern sunsets lingered for hours . Siguelanders said the sun bled to death each night ; this dazzling show repeated the story of Sun 's grisly murder by his lover Moon , who stabbed him while he slept , jealous of his affection for a mortal woman . <br> The noise of the ocean penned in by the icy harbor was terrific . Ice groaned , squeaked , and bellowed . Water droplets froze in midair and fell toward the wooden pier , bouncing upon its snowy crust like scattered , shining stones . Nearer the surface , one long sheet of ice groaned deep within its white skin , a sound like a woman birthing , or so it seemed to Sorykah , still sentimental from the memory of her own children 's birth but a lunar skein behind . The Sigue was the Land of Ice Song , a surreal pole formed from ice that sang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another with subarctic cricket legs , keening shards and frosts that played the most primitive and abstract melodies yet had shaped the culture of this tiny nation . Musicians and singers attempted to capture the eerie , haunting songs but could not repeat the melancholic strains . Sound technicians embedded microphones deep within the ice plates in an effort to record the music , chart the notes , pitch , and timing of the songs , but the recordings replayed a mishmash of disconnected sounds , discordant and chaotic . The melody was lost in translation and the mocking ice refused capture by human whim . Hearing it now  --  angry , plaintive , sorrowful  --  Sorykah remembered why she had volunteered for this frigid , outlandish post , for the Sigue song replicated her own bitter tune . Perhaps the ice could sing to drive out the ghosts within her , banish the image of that deceitful Trader as he climbed from her bed , the smug , careless grin he 'd offered as he wiped himself clean and slid into his trousers . <br> Sorykah licked the salt from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dock , his bright orange flags lost among the colorful clouds . She would live on the Sigue for the next two years , drilling the ice to extract iridescent tubes of microbe- rich frozen seawater . Northern processing stations would melt , distill , and bottle the fossil water for sale in nightclubs and restaurants , to be guzzled by sensation- seeking holidaymakers . The Company claimed that fossil water was the first nonaddictive substance to create recreational altered states . Touted as a panacea , the burgeoning fossil water trade rapidly had become the fastest- growing market segment of free- trade capital . Water had finally replaced gold and oil as the world 's most valuable commodity . <br> Even with modern conveniences , ice mining was rough work ; Sorykah eagerly anticipated a reprieve before the sub 's giant bits and rigs were pressed into service on the morrow . To maintain a competitive edge , the Company drove them in recycling , fourteen- hour shifts . They pushed hard ; the rig cut ice nonstop to harvest as much as possible during spring thaws , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ships in the process . Furloughs were meant to be savored ; a vacation day was an oasis promising warm hotel rooms , a soak in the famed Sigue sulfur springs , and perhaps a willing companion , bought for a few hours from one of the dockside bars  --  a brief respite of heat and haze in the midst of a cold black ocean . <br> The ice was no more of a challenge for Sorykah than bedrock and granite . She was a miner by trade , an engineer and a doctor of ecology . However , she lived as a woman most of the time and the controlling , misogynist Company culture did not allow women to do anything more mentally taxing than the most rudimentary work aboard the Nimbus . Tucked among the books and data of her dry profession in the progressive city of Dirinda , she could have played the university professor were she brave enough to weather the few prickly questions and stares that sometimes accompanied her public outings . Aboard the Nimbus , she was just a grunt  --  another core- drilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sub from the engine room instead of being buried in one of the tiny miner 's cells , but she had deferred to the omnipotent Company , happy to have a job that paid enough to support her two children and their nanny , Nels . A burning sensation flared in Sorykah 's heavy breasts and milk dampened her cotton bra . She had a sudden image of her twins curled like commas in her lap , their chubby hands roving over each other 's hair and Sorykah 's gown the morning before she departed to join the mining crew . Drowsy and warm , the three lay in Sorykah 's small bed , cozy within a nest of protective arms and fluffy down duvet . She had fed them one last time , stroked their heads , memorized the whorls of their soft , waving curls and the texture of their skin . She had inhaled their scent ; no matter what they ate , they smelled of apples , amaranth flour , and sticky- sweet mother 's milk . Ayeda 's forehead was as smooth as a polished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were small ships seeking the safety of a familiar and welcoming harbor . How was it possible to find such satisfaction , such pleasure in their care ? <br> The pregnancy had destroyed Sorykah 's life but the birth of her children had restored it , breaking open her detachment 's careful fatade and sending her reeling into sensation and wakefulness . At the very beginning , adrift and alone , she had wished them away , or rather wished the experience away , back to less encumbered days . The thought was but a flickering spark , and guttered out as it should . <br> She missed them very much . <br> Her breasts ached . She was surprised to find tears welling as she emerged from her reverie . She hated how fragile the babies made her feel , like a teacup balanced atop a precarious , swaying block tower . <br> That such a rash act had brought her those two ! The babies had split her open , leaving her raw and bared to experiences both sensual and deeply emotional , and bullied her into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds from her governmental maternity grant , Sorykah had hired a nursemaid . Generous and superficially stern as all good nannies should be , Nels was a plump , blond devotee of the Blessed Jerusha , matron saint of mothers , children , and outcasts . Religious devotion was foreign to secular , math- minded Sorykah , but even as she marveled at Nels 's rigid and unyielding faith , she admired her constancy . <br> Nels had remained in Dirinda with the children while Sorykah completed her assignment . Now Nels was en route to the Sigue , bringing both children and luggage via the overland train to Ostara . Once established in their new Company- built home , Nels would keep the twins during Sorykah 's tours , teaching them their letters and numbers , how to gauge the thickness of pack ice for walking or skating , or how to tease the occasional egg from the warm underbelly of an island bird . <br> The sub plowed inland through the frozen , slushy sea . Solid ground loomed behind crackling ribbons of ice churned up by the sub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s conning tower , Sorykah clutched the railing in excitement as she strained toward shore , attempting to view the town through obfuscating swirls of blowing snow and vapor . Ramshackle tin sheds and concrete block storefronts lined Ostara 's harbor , their weather- ravaged fatades slumping against each other like tired old men huddled together against the cold . <br> Ostara was a dirty little place thrown together by a steady surge of transient workers on get- rich- quick missions . Hunters , poachers , and pirates on the lam populated its rough fringes . Bars , brothels , and hotels of questionable virtue crowded the harbor , jostling for space and patrons . Crude wood- framed houses , their walls stuffed with insulating hay and dung , and aluminum Quonset huts spread inland away from the sea , forming concentric rings of increasing squalor . A few small families from the decimated indigenous population clung tenaciously to their ancestral homes , the last stragglers of the ice- dwelling tribe that had ruled the Sigue for a thousand years . Their igloos dotted Ostara 's perimeter , small snowy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The town offered few comforts but it was land , steady and beloved after the rigors of drilling far below on the ocean floor . <br> The quay tightened into view . Sailors , miners , and soldiers appeared as dark clumps moving through sparkling clouds of airborne snow , a city populated by shadows and ghosts . A few lights glowed in the frost- etched windows . Locals slogged over wooden walkways slippery with packed snow and crenellations of ice . Walking upright in their bundles of fur and padding , they resembled well- fed bears lumbering along on some private errand , a stark contrast to the sleekly outfitted Company men in their expensive long- coats and insulated blue thermosuits . The sub shuddered , engines throbbing as it inched into port . Icy seawater foamed and crackled around the ship and Sorykah 's anticipation peaked . She could taste freedom , hers to savor if just for a few hours . <br> She did n't want to leave the children for so long at this early age , but Sorykah had to accept this assignment if she meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its firing tactics ; it was all policies , percentages , and rules with no deviation from the hard line ; productivity and profit was its sole concern . Mining was all she had . Sealing herself in a floating metal coffin with a load of gruff , self- absorbed laborers was flimsy insurance against discovery . It was a matter of containing the danger of exposure . Controlling the circle around her minimized the chance of a surprise encounter with some psychotic hunter or Trader fetishist . <br> She 'd repelled plenty of their advances over the years , learning how to protect and cloak herself from those with eyes trained to see the little details that distinguished her kind . Working with the same crew for months on the sub , she learned who to trust and who to avoid ; keeping her secret meant keeping away from those who might reveal her . She was always careful , yet a steady under- current of fear pulsed behind everything she did ; a cool and constant stream of caution tempered her every word and deed , leaving her numbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled her scarf up over her nose and mouth . Her heart was as light as a little bird , restless inside the cage of her ribs . Somewhere on shore , her two babies waited . They would n't have forgotten their mother after a single month 's absence from their lives , would they ? <br> Her babies . A girl and boy when last she saw them , Ayeda the light and Leander the dark . Her coin , her treasure . Ayeda got her coloring from her father ; rich olive skin , wispy honey- colored hair and eyes like polished nickels or threatening rain clouds . Leander took after somber Sorykah , seal dark and slender with eyes like inky black wells . Two average Trader babies , one of each and each in one , it was said . So it was with her twins , little shifters they were , inconstant and fluid , taking the change with an astonishing ease that impressed her . She could n't remember ever having been that way . For her the change was always slow and arduous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathless upon awakening . Sometimes she envied them ; if she could have weathered her own change with more ease , she might not have had such knotted feelings about being a Trader , might even take pride and pleasure in her ability the way some did . A few brave ( or foolish ) Traders made their living with their bodies , charging by the poke , but it was a perilous road to walk . Sorykah shunned admiration , preferring instead to curl head- down in dark corners . Safe , she hoped  --  unseen and unnoticed . <br> The Nimbus eased itself into a deep slip ringed with waiting Company men , stamping their boots against the ice and puffing great frozen blasts of impatience into the air . Sorykah stood alone , clutching her duffel bag . None of the other miners was eager or foolhardy enough to brave the slippery deck . They sensibly waited below , playing a final round of cards to earn a little more drinking money before storming Ostara 's bars . As soon as a red- nosed docker extended the gangway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumping solid ground . She was glad she had covered her face . Between her black wool hat , the thick scarf over her mouth , and the bulky black long- coat , thermosuit and magnet boots she wore , she was almost indistinguishable from the tide of miners that would soon surge from the ship , similarly dressed in regulation gear . Few would pay much attention to her . Pushing through crowds of Company men , she kept her head down as if watching her footing . New people made her antsy ; never could tell who was who , who might want what . Better to mind her own . Miners ' rusty but cheerful voices began to fill the air behind her as the sub disgorged its crew . <br> Sorykah walked along Port Street , skirting roguish clumps of uniformed men , fur- swaddled locals with narrowed , crinkleskinned eyes , and a pair of dirty- faced women in patchwork parkas towing a two- handled sledge over the ice . Frozen ropes clattered against their flapping tarp and seeping , red- splattered slabs of thick white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Flickering streetlights cast tepid blotches of waxy yellow light on the wooden walkway , lonely pools of optimism that bobbed over the hard ground in a fruitless attempt to drive away the cold and gloom . <br> The train station was a half mile from the end of Port , a lonesome walk across tamped- down snow . A battered Quonset crouched beside frost- laced tracks , outlined in gathering flurries . A few caged bulbs dangled from wooden poles and capered wildly overhead , pinning white shards of snow in their glare . The tracks ran parallel to Sorykah 's path . Then , steaming up out of the grayness in a cloud of charcoal exhaust , came the train . Hissing and squealing , its brakes bore down with the ear splitting shriek of metal on metal and Sorykah began to run , crunching over the snow , subarctic air stinging her eyes as the train , at last , arrived . <br> Continues ...
