Prelude to a Great Adventure The soldier brave of dauntless heart // The presidential election of 1800 had been vicious and toxic . Failing to foresee an impending embarrassment , Thomas Jefferson had already chosen James Madison to be a member of his cabinet council and depended on him to quell party fear of a split vote . But when the college of electors assembled in the muddy new capital in February 1801 , it took an embarrassing thirty-six votes before the deadlock between Jefferson and Aaron Burr was finally broken . On February 17 , 1801 , the House of Representatives chose Thomas Jefferson as the third president of the United States . Next day he wrote to the Revolutionary War veteran Henry Dearborn insisting that he take the job of secretary of war . However , it was mid- May before the president completed his cabinet by replacing Samuel Dexter with Albert Gallatin as secretary of the treasury . The Swiss-born former congressman favored economy and fiscal responsibility in government . The appointment left no doubt that Jefferson intended to remove influential Federalists and replace them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the nation . // Jefferson was a conversationalist , not an orator . When he was sworn in on March 4 he squeaked through an inaugural address that declared that " we are all republicans ... we are all federalists ... a rising nation , spread over a wise and fruitful land ... advancing rapidly to destinies beyond the reach of mortal eye . " // President by the thinnest of margins , Mr. Jefferson had never been west of the Appalachian Mountains , as had few men of his acquaintance . According to the historian Dale Van Every , " He was an easterner who had spent his life in the study , in legislative halls , and in administrative offices . His greatest interests , aside from an intense and all-encompassing scientific curiosity , had been in democratic doctrine , constitutional law , and diplomacy . " 4 At a time when the aging heroes of the Revolution were giving way to veterans of the western Indian wars , the president had no military experience and an uncertain appreciation of the profession of arms . And he faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamilton 's knee-jerk reaction to a French threat in 1798 during the Adams administration . // In what might have seemed to be the insignificant appointment of a personal secretary , the fifty-seven-year-old intellectual selected a soldier thirty-one years younger than himself . Past intimacy led the president to believe that the young officer possessed talents that would be very useful for an important role he had in mind . Jefferson approached the recently promoted Capt . Meriwether Lewis because they were well acquainted " from his being of my neighborhood . " That was something of an understatement because Jefferson had known Lewis 's father and other relatives who were part of the Charlottesville neighborhood around Monticello . From beginnings as tidewater Virginians , over the years those families had followed colonial expansion into the Virginia piedmont . They knew each other well . // The home of William Lewis and Lucy Meriwether , called Locust Hill , was about ten miles west of Monticello . After the birth of a daughter their first son was born on August 18 , 1774 . That made Meriwether Lewis a child of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revolution and growing up during the conflict . When his son was just a toddler , William Lewis went off to war . The boy had little to remember of the officer who came home for brief visits to look after the crops and rode off again on a good horse . He had been the third man to sign the Albemarle County declaration of independence from an English king . The boy was just five in mid-November 1779 , the last time he saw his father ride away in the rain . Later , a rider came from uncle Nicholas Lewis 's home to tell his mother that her husband had gotten soaked trying to cross a swollen stream and had wheezed his life away from pneumonia . Only later did they get to visit the grave . // Locust Hill saw its share of uniformed men during those war years . Uncle Nicholas Lewis led his regiment against British-instigated Cherokees and was well respected in the community . His mother 's brother , uncle Nicholas Meriwether , stepped in to help manage the over a thousand-acre plantation and twenty-four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death there were four thousand British prisoners penned in barracks at the Cart Farm along Ivy Creek . Those were the British prisoners who surrendered near the Saratoga battlefield in upstate New York in 1777 . When paroled redcoat officers slipped away and tried to impose their supercilious presence upon Locust Hill , the young widow Lucy Lewis drove them away . The children remembered the tension . // With three children to protect , there was no question that the young widow should remarry . Six months after her husband 's death Lucy Lewis married Capt . John Marks , whose health prevented him from further participation in the war . They moved to Winchester when the terrible British cavalry officer Banastre Tarleton raided the country . He failed to seize important rebels like Thomas Jefferson but left Albemarle County razed and shattered . // The war lasted eight years , from 1775 until 1783 . After the peace veterans had difficulties settling down . Despite his health , Captain Marks decided to follow his commander , Gen. John Mathews , and established a plantation on the Broad River in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new frontier with the elbow room a growing boy needs to range the woods and protect the stump-patched fields from varmints . Admirers have concocted stories that he studied and learned to identify the plants and animals he found in those rambles through the post oak and blackjack parklands . But he was just a growing boy , and mastering natural history was n't the concern of a berry picker and hunter . // When he was thirteen Meriwether was sent back to Albemarle County to be better schooled . Soon he was studying English grammar , Latin , math , a bit of natural science , and was reading geography on his own . Most of what is known about the education and early life of Meriwether Lewis is written in his own hand , in the letters that his mother received and carefully preserved , not as documents to enlighten some future researcher but rather as proofs of their devotion to each other . Due to the wanderings of a boy in pursuit of an education or a son following a military career , the letters that Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have expressed a mother 's concern for his health in an unhealthy world , or a widow 's concern about a family inheritance that was scattered over four states in vague claims to often unsurveyed lands . Some warrants for land had to do with the father 's service during the Revolution . That was a reminder that William Lewis died , not before the enemies ' guns , but from the erosion of his health during a life in the field , the same challenging career that her darling son was now also pursuing . // It had been no small thing for each of them when the young boy left the Broad River frontier in spring 1787 to travel north along the Appalachian Mountains , where hostile Indians still ranged . He rode accompanied by someone , a trusted slave perhaps , to the home of his uncle Nicholas Lewis , where he stayed for almost a year while they cast about for a tutor . // It was the practice in a time of few publicly sponsored schools that an education beyond the basics had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area were usually ministers who had been educated in England or Europe and taught subjects like grammar , Latin , classic literature , history , and philosophy . After an initial period of uncertainty Lewis began his studies with Parson Mathew Maury , the son of Thomas Jefferson 's teacher . In his quest for an education young Lewis later studied with Dr. Charles Everitt and finally the kindly Rev. James Waddell. // Often students would board with their teachers , so studies were an intense , full-time dedication to the disciplines of each subject taken in a concentrated dose before moving on to another . Some boys burned out under the pressure but Meriwether applied himself so diligently that his cousin William D. Meriwether felt he was well enough founded in English grammar that he could read geography on his own and save the tuition . Later , to save money when he studied with Parson Maury , the scholar lived with his uncle Peachy Gilmer. // His younger cousin Peachy Gilmer later described Meriwether as " always remarkable for persevereance , which in the early period of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employ that age ; a martial temper , great steadiness of purpose , self-possession , and undaunted courage . His person was stiff and without grace , bow-legged , awkward , formal , and almost without flexibility . His face was comely and by many considered handsome . " // The young scholar could afford a good education . Under the transplanted English rules of primogeniture , he , not his mother , inherited the father 's estate . A large plantation of almost two thousand acres worked by twenty-four slaves , 147 gallons of whiskey probably distilled on the premises , and ? 520 in cash was a large responsibility . That made young Meriwether one of those boys who , losing a father at an early age , tries to become his surrogate . The letters that survive demonstrate his concern for his widowed mother , Lucy , but that did not make him a mother 's boy . // At eighteen , Meriwether was an adult , perhaps too soon , when he learned from his older sister , Jane Anderson , that their stepfather , Capt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lucy Marks had written expressing a desire to be nearer to her married daughter and the grandchildren . // When Meriwether responded to that yearning in October 1791 , he did not see how he could get away from his schooling for another eighteen months or two years . The letter ended with a curious comment : " It is currently reported here that you are Mrs. Harvey . " By the following April he relented and wrote to his mother that he was having a carriage built at Monticello , Jefferson 's home , which should be ready by May 12 . Lewis brought his widowed mother back to Virginia , settled in at the family estate Locust Hill , and for about a year followed the life of a Virginia planter and young blood . // That was an age that gave scant recognition to childhood and none at all to adolescence . Meriwether became an adult young and had a lot of early life squeezed out of him , replaced with responsibilities he had n't sought and might in some deep , buried place resent . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through the example and advice of his uncle Nicholas Lewis , he learned how to manage his inheritance . That meant riding the fields to ensure that the crops were properly planted , tended , and harvested and that the field hands kept at their work . Those black slaves were under the supervision of an overseer but there was no doubt who was the young master . // How the boy was turning out was noticed by their neighbor . With the special interest of someone who had been through a similar loss of a father at about the same age , Thomas Jefferson had watched the young Meriwether grow into a responsible young man . It is difficult to pinpoint when a mutually shared curiosity about natural science began between Jefferson and Meriwether Lewis . But it ended for the moment when Lewis put on a uniform . // Meriwether was the son of a soldier of the Revolution and the ward of a soldier uncle . Everyone who mattered in his life had worn an officer 's epaulette-captains Lewis , Marks , and Uncle Nicholas Lewis . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty Lewis volunteered for a militia company that was being raised to suppress a rebellion by whiskey distillers in western Pennsylvania . Twenty-year-old Lewis was responding to Father Washington 's call to put down what was seen as a tax rebellion . // Farmers who had crossed the Appalachian Mountain chain had no easy way of getting their produce to market . Bulky sacks could not be packed across the mountains profitably and floating them down the Ohio and the Mississippi risked grave sickness like yellow fever and malaria . Lacking a convenient market for their crops , frontiersmen had learned to concentrate their wheat , rye , or corn into more portable potables . They had been outraged when the nation specifically taxed what amounted to the only resort of isolated pioneers . // In 1794 a new federal law required the registration of whiskey stills . The eight gallons that a still produced sold for a dollar a gallon . But the tax on them was fifty-six cents . When the notorious land speculator Gen. John Neville tried to fine a local man $250 for failing to register his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to force him to resign his commission . As mobs gathered , shots were exchanged . Maj. James McFarlane led five hundred protestors against the embattled Neville house , where he was shot and killed . Taking this escalation of protest as a test of federal authority , President George Washington ordered the secretary of war to request the governors of four states to raise over twelve thousand militia troops . No matter that those fellow Virginians across the mountains had no other way of converting their land-locked crops into desperately needed cash , Lewis the young planter joined the local militia . When he rode off on a good plantation horse to sow wild oats with the militia , there was no escaping his responsibilities . He kept his mother reassured about his health , as he did later when he was with the army on the frontier . But he also included allusions in his letters to the high times he and his comrades were having , a suggestion that he believed his mother was no prude and would understand some high jinks . He teased that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title of Mrs. Lewis . " // The Revolutionary War Gen. Daniel Morgan was a hard man who crushed the tax protest and left a substantial force to police the rebel heartland . Most of the taxation minutemen went home , but Lewis liked the posturing and illusions of field and camp and volunteered to stay on with the occupation force . That was more fun than being a farmer , and he was willing to pay an overseer named Carrell twenty pounds a year to look after his business . // Young Meriwether enjoyed the autumn outing , the amateur display of martial ardor , the good fellowship , " the mountains of beef and oceans of whiskey . " Lewis was a Virginia buck on an outing and probably chased away the cold October damp with the local distillation . As winter closed in , the occupying force cut timber for huts on the property of the slain leader of the protest , James McFarlane . // No hint of sympathetic consideration crept into the letters Ensign Lewis wrote home . For him the Whiskey Rebellion was just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accused and developed a personal relationship during the winter 1794-1795 with the McFarlane brothers ; James , John , Andrew , and Lewis were not so much enemies than roistering drinking companions . // There was a moment of tenderness on January 15 , 1795 , when Capt . Thomas Walker died . Meriwether looked to the necessary arrangements , a walnut post fence around the plot but no gravestone lest unredeemed rebels despoil it . The deceased was the son of Thomas Walker , the founder of Charlottesville and an associate of Mr. Jefferson . Lewis wrote a letter to the captain 's father to ease the loss and another on May 23 before leaving the McFarlane farm , confirming that he had planted the six willows that the grieving parent sent to shade the grave . // By then the militiamen knew that last August Gen. Anthony Wayne 's legion had defeated the British-instigated tribes at a place called Fallen Timbers in northwestern Ohio . That was an overdue victory after two terrible previous defeats to General Harmar and General St. Clair . // Lewis rationalized his escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His decision to join the Legion of the United States could be explained : " So violently opposed is my governing passion for rambling to the wishes of all my friends that I am led intentionally to err and then have vanity enough to hope for forgiveness . I do not know how to account for the Quixottic disposition of mine ... than that of having inherited it in right of the Meriwether Family . " In other words her " ever sincere tho wandering son " shifted his guilt to his mother 's side of the family . // ( Continues ... ) //
