There was no doubt in Hiram Bingham 's mind that he had stumbled onto something mystical in the summer of 1911 , when he discovered the dazzling Incan settlement now known as Machu Picchu . He was convinced that the remote Peruvian outpost dotted with temples was a sacred city , the birthplace and final stronghold of the Incas , where virgins sought sanctuary and priests worshipped the sun god . The charismatic Bingham  --  a Yale University archaeologist , later a Connecticut Governor and U.S. Senator and much later a model for Hollywood 's Indiana Jones  --  announced , in a series of magazine articles and best-selling books , what he had found , and the world ate them up . Tourists and spiritual seekers have been making the pilgrimage to Machu Picchu ever since . <P> But what , exactly , are they visiting ? More than 90 years after Machu Picchu first landed on the scientific map , modern archaeologists are making a persuasive case that it was n't a spiritual center at all . Machu Picchu , it turns out , may have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his royal court , sort of a 15th century Camp David . " It was just a country palace where they 'd go to get away from the capital , Cuzco , " says Yale archaeologist Richard Burger . " It was only a three-day walk away . " <P> In retrospect , Bingham can be excused for concluding that Machu Picchu was the holiest of Incan sites . Its inaccessibility certainly suggested that . So did some of its apparently religious structures , which were built with distinctive three-window designs , evoking the legend that the Incan people were created by three brothers who appeared through a trio of portals . And the large percentage of uncovered skeletons that Bingham 's expert determined to be female suggested the remains of an Incan nunnery . <P> But the idea that much of this is fantasy is pretty persuasive too . There are no Incan records  --  the Incas had no written language  --  but the Spaniards , who conquered so much of South America , kept plenty . Fifteen years ago , John Howland Rowe , an anthropologist at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left by the Spaniards at Cuzco and came across a 16th century lawsuit filed by descendants of Pachacuti seeking the return of royal family lands , including a retreat called Picchu . Over the years , other researchers have dug deeper into the mystery , none deeper than Burger , a onetime student of Rowe 's , and his wife Lucy Salazar , a Yale archaeologist .
