Headnote Start by ending government subsidies for oil and coal - giving innovative solutions a fair chance to compete IN EARLY MAY , 100 OF THE NATION 'S TOP BUSINESS LEADERS GATHERED FOR A SUMMIT at a private resort nestled on 2,50 acres in California 's Napa Valley . The attendees , gathered at the invitation of Silicon Valley venture capitalists , included CEOs and other top executives from such Fortune 500 corporations as Wal-Mart , Proctor &; Gamble and BR They had been invited to discuss ways to end America 's fossil-fuel addiction and save the world from global warming . But in reality they had come to make money for their companies - and that may turn out to be the thing that saves us . For three days , the executives listened as their colleagues and business rivals described how they are using new technologies to wean themselves from oil and boost their profits in the process . DuPont has cut its climate ' warming pollution by seventy-two percent since 1990 , slashing $3 billion from its energy bills while increasing its global production by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light bulbs in refrigeration units that save the company $12 million a year , and skylights that cut utility bills by up to $70,000 per store . The company , which operates the nation 's secondlargest corporate truck fleet , also saved $22 million last year just by installing auxiliary power units that allow drivers to operate electric systems without idling their vehicles . In a move with even more far-reaching potential , Wal-Mart has ordered its truck suppliers to double the gas mileage of the company 's entire fleet by 2015 . When those trucks become available to other businesses , America will cut its demand for oil by six percent . The executives gathered at the retreat were n't waiting around for federal subsidies or new regulations to tilt the market in their direction . Business logic , not government intervention , was driving them to cut energy costs and invest in new fuel sources . " We have n't even touched the low-hanging fruit yet , " Kim Saylors-Laster , the vice president of energy for Wal-Mart , told the assembled CEOs . " We 're still getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As the discussions at the summit demonstrated , America 's top executives know something that the Bush administration has yet to realize : America does n't need to wait for futuristic , pie-in-the-sky technologies to cut its reckless consumption of oil and coal . Our last , best hope to stop climate change is the free market itself . There is gold in going green , and the same drive to make a buck that created global warming in the first place can now be harnessed to slow the carbon-based pollution that is overheating the planet . And green investment will not just enrich a few corporations . We know from past experience that it will strengthen America 's economy , not to mention our national security , our economic independence and the effectiveness of our world leadership . During the oil crisis sparked by OPEC in the 19705 , American business and government went into overdrive to promote conservation and develop alternatives to Middle Eastern oil . Between 1977 and 1985 , Detroit boosted the fuel efficiency of its automobiles from eighteen to 27.5 miles per gallon . oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-seven percent . Even more important , oil imports from the Persian Gulf plunged by eighty-seven percent , breaking the cartel 's power over America 's economy . Had we stayed the course , we would not have needed to import a single drop of oil from the Middle East after 1986 - achieving true energy independence that , in all likelihood , would have enabled us to avoid the devastating attacks of September nth , as well as both Gulf wars . " We customers have more market power than the oil cartel , " says Amory Lovins , the physicist whose efforts to get big business to go green have made him the Paul Revere of energy independence . " OPEC has its megabarrels , but we are the Saudi Arabia of negabarrels - the energy we save through conservation and energy efficiency . The reality is , we can save oil faster and cheaper than the oil cartel can conveniently sell less oil . " SO WHY , IF WE CAN PROFITABLY slash planet-warming pollution , does the world face a climate crisis ? The answer is simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result not of an orderly free market , but of a distorted market run amok . A truly free market is the planet 's best friend . Free markets promote efficiency . " Efficiency , " after all , means the elimination of waste - and pollution is waste . The pollution that is catastrophically heating the Earth is the result of market failure ; the incapacity of a poorly designed marketplace to place a proper value on an essential asset - the atmosphere . That market failure has brought us to the brink of a planetwide environmental collapse . King Coal and the oil barons like to pretend that their industries dominate the energy sector because their products are cheaper and more efficient than alternative fuels , giving them a competitive advantage in the free market . This is a myth . The dominance of fossil fuels is the direct result of corporate welfare and crony capitalism that would make a Nigerian dictator balk . Direct federal subsidies to Big oil - everything from loan guarantees and research support to outright tax breaks and waived royalty fees - amount to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money distorts the marketplace , artificially lowering the price of gasoline and making it difficult for other fuels to compete . Little wonder that the oil industry was able to report profits of more than $137 billion last year . Hidden subsidies to the industry are even higher than the direct benefits it receives from our government . Studies show that oil pollution causes at least $4.6 billion in damages each year to crops , forests , rivers , buildings and monuments - destruction that Big oil is not held liable for . The industry also fails to pick up the annual tab for the $54.7 billion that Americans pay to treat the host of debilitating illnesses caused by oil pollution . In addition , taxpayers spend as much as $100 billion each year to defend the industry 's infrastructure around the world , maintaining bases in the Middle East and providing military escorts for oil tankers bound for America . And that does not include the more than $100 billion that the Pentagon has spent annually in Iraq since the war began - another expense that should appear on Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former director of the California EPA , the true costs of our oil dependence run as high as $807 billion a year - or $2,700 for every U.S. citizen . If all the hidden costs that Americans currently pay for oil were reflected in the price at the pump , gasoline would cost more than $13 a gallon . In short , taxpayers and consumers are essentially giving the oil industry a subsidy of $10 for every gallon of gas sold in America . If we simply eliminated those subsidies and created a truly free market , renewable sources of energy would beat oil - as well as nuclear power and coal , which receive equally grotesque subsidies . It is only through these giant subsidies that gasoline has a prayer of competing with alternative sources such as biofuels and wind , which produce energy far more cleanly and efficiently , at far less cost . Back in the 19705 , President Jimmy Carter attempted to level the playing field by creating incentives and minimal subsidies to jump-start clean fuels in the marketplace . But then Ronald Reagan took office and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House roof torn off . He rolled back fuel standards for automobiles , killed federal incentives that had given America a commanding lead in wind and solar power , and doubled our oil imports . Reagan 's efforts fueled the current oil addiction that has us acting like a crack-house junkie rolling old ladies for drug money . Our Jones for petrodrugs has not only superheated the planet , it has embroiled us in the Mesopotamian quagmire and made America a pariah among civilized nations , damaging the cause of democracy across the globe . Our deadly carbon dependence is the result not just of subsidies , but of a deliberate criminal effort by the oil companies and auto manufacturers to subvert the free market and rig the system in favor of their products . Between 1920 and 1955 , General Motors , Standard oil , Firestone and others financed a front company that systematically bought up and destroyed electric streetcars in forty-five American cities , including New York , Philadelphia , St. Louis and Los Angeles . In an illegal conspiracy to eliminate mass transit , they tore up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil refineries , replacing clean , efficient streetcars with more costly and filthy diesel buses . During the Truman administration , the Justice Department successfully prosecuted GM and the oil companies for antitrust conspiracy , but following their convictions a friendly judge allowed them to walk , slapping one executive with a $i fine . The crime was done . In 2003 , the Justice Department did n't even bother to investigate automobile manufacturers who maneuvered to kill the electric car . After suing California to repeal a rule mandating the production of cleaner vehicles , GM recalled every one of its EV-is , its popular all-electric car , and sent them to a demolition yard to be crushed . GM also sold its stake in the car 's nickel battery system to none other than Texaco - a company with a vested interest in keeping the innovative technology under lock and key . The truth is , we have designed a perverted market system that rewards oil companies , carmakers and other polluters for bad behavior , allowing them to dispose of their wastes into the publicly owned air for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety over global warming give more cause for hope than ever before . With a little tinkering we can reconfigure and rationalize the market so that it punishes bad behavior ( releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere ) and rewards good behavior ( reducing pollution and conserving energy ) . Such a move would unleash the extraordinary entrepreneurial energies of our nation so that every American could profit by devising and implementing their own solutions to global warming . With a rational marketplace , new materials and technologies would allow us to rapidly rerun the playbook strategies that nearly liberated us from oil in the 1980s . Within two decades we could get off imported oil completely- this time for good . IF WE REALLY WANT FREE MARkets in America , all direct subsidies to the fossil-fuel industry should be eliminated . In addition , indirect subsidies or " externalities " - the hidden costs of global warming should be accounted for through a carbon tax . By taxing pollution instead of productivity , America could spur a wave of technological and commercial innovation that would rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive to solve the greatest crisis facing our planet . ( see " Platform for the Planet , " Page 67 . ) Given the clout of the oil industry , however , it will take time and enormous political will to implement a tax on carbon production . Fortunately , there are ways we can foster the immediate adoption of cleaner and more efficient energy technologies - without pissing off the oil industry and its powerful political allies , all eager to stall reform . Here are six modest , tried-and-true mechanisms we can implement to quickly foster free-market solutions to global warming : Feebates California is considering imposing a $2,500 fee on Hummers and other low-efficiency automobiles - and then rebating that money to drivers who choose to purchase more efficient cars like hybrids . This cross between a fee and a rebate motivates manufacturers to develop less-polluting vehicles and is a perfect example of how to give consumers an incentive to conform their self-interest to the public interest , turning every driver into a guerrilla warrior in the battle against global warming . Cap and Trade One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a mandatory cap on planet-warming pollution - one that begins by cutting emissions now and then reduces them eighty percent by 2050 . Establishing mandatory limits in all industrial sectors would create a huge market for products and technologies that use less energy and emit far less carbon . In addition , companies that figure out how to cut their emissions to below their limit will earn credits that can be sold to those companies that ca n't meet their quota , creating a powerful incentive to actually beat the pollution limits . California , New York and a dozen other states are already experimenting with various cap-and-trade systems , recognizing that if they level the playing field with marketwide limits and smart incentives , the market will respond . Clean Incentives Revenues from the sale of carbon credits under the cap-andtrade system should be used to create market-based financial incentives to speed the development and adoption of promising new technologies . Europe has created a gold rush in solar energy by promising to buy energy at premium pricing from homeowners who generate power from rooftop panels . All across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes with solar collectors and transform their residences into mini power plants . " Everyone is becoming an entrepreneur , " says Bill McDonough , an architect who has received three presidential awards for his sustainable designs . Connecticut already offers a rebate of up to $46,500 for homeowners who go solar , and Congress could boost the rapid expansion of existing technologies by providing similar incentives for solar water heaters , residential wind turbines , geothermal systems , modern electronic lighting and improved insulation . Incentives could also help Detroit convert to electric cars and encourage consumers to replace aging automobiles , washing machines , air conditioners and refrigerators . Decoupling Utilities currently make money only by producing and selling us more electricity- giving power companies little incentive to promote energy efficiency . California , however , has decoupled profits from energy sales , creating a new kind of market that rewards efficiency . Utilities make money not by selling power but by helping consumers use it more productively in their homes . The result : Californians use almost half as many kilowatts as other Americans . " We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a rapidly growing population , while the average per-capita energy consumption for the rest of the nation has soared by fifty percent , " says Tom King , CEO of Pacific Gas and Electric . " And we have n't even made a dent in the potential that 's out there - we can go beyond anything anybody 's ever projected . " Net Metering California also took an early lead in this area , allowing homeowners who install solar panels or wind turbines to sell their excess electricity back to the utility . The electric meter actually spins backward when the home is generating more electricity than it consumes , and customers are billed only for the net amount of energy they consume from the utility 's grid . " Our objective is to give every homeowner the incentive to turn their house into a clean-energy power station , " says King . " We can not only replace gasoline and dramatically reduce carbon emissions , but we 'll also have a grid that is more decentralized and hence more resilient . " Performance Standards The quickest way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buildings is to establish minimum standards based on the current state of technology . Rather than prescribing specific solutions , performance standards harness the market by establishing targets and rewarding companies that create the best emissionscutting technology . The government has successfully done this for energy-intensive appliances like refrigerators , which now consume seventy-five percent less energy than they did twenty-five years ago . We also need strong standards to keep some very bad technologies from rushing into the market under the banner of energy efficiency . A particularly ugly aspect of the current coal rush , for example , is the desire of the industry and its servants in Congress , Democrats and Republicans , to build a new breed of refinery that would liquefy coal to replace gasoline . Advocates claim that liquid coal is clean , but the process results in nearly twice as much carbon pollution per gallon as gasoline . And whatever the process , why would we want to create an entire new industry dependent on an energy source that is procured by blowing up mountains in Appalachia and strip-mining the West ? WHAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in which alternative energy could compete on an equal footing with oil and coal ? In 2004 , physicist Amory Lovins answered that question . In a study co-funded by the Defense Department , Lovins and his colleagues at the Rocky Mountain Institute detailed how the United States can completely wean itself off all oil - and create a much stronger economy - by 2050 . The transition from oil outlined by Lovins would occur in two stages . First , half of our current demand for oil can be eliminated simply by using oil twice as efficiently . We 've already done this once doubling our efficiency since 1975 - and we can do it again simply by encouraging the adoption of existing technologies . Then , the remaining half of our oil demand can be replaced with acombination of natural gas and advanced biofuels . The result would not only end our oil addiction completely , it would also lower our energy costs to the equivalent of $15 a barrel - a quarter of what we currently pay . The study by Lovins shows how - with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aviation industries , create greener and more energy-efficient buildings and foster a modern biofuels industry . Even assuming that the price of oil drops by more than half by 2025 , Lovins shows that going oilfree would net Americans $70 billion a year - an impressive return on our initial $180 billion investment ! At the same time , we would not only reduce the threat posed by global warming , we would also generate a million new jobs - three-quarters of them in rural and small-town America . There is no shortage of technology and innovation waiting to be unlocked and put to use by the market . We already possess the high-performance plastics , ultralight steel and carbon-fiber composites needed to reduce the weight of cars and trucks - a move that would cut fuel consumption in half while improving auto safety . This is not the Jetsons ' stuff : Opel has already produced a prototype carbon-fiber roadster that does 155 miles an hour and gets as much as 94 miles per gallon . And within the next five years , Toyota and General Motors are expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to travel at least 150 miles on a single charge . " It 's a nobrainer for most drivers , " says former CIA director James Woolsey , who views global warming and energy dependence as the number-one threat to America 's national security . " And the only infrastructure you need is an extension cord in your garage . " A green revolution is also taking place in building construction . In Lower Manhattan , according to city officials , every new construction project valued at more than $25 million is being built on environmentfriendly principles . More than 500 mayors of American cities have passed or pledged to pass green standards for new development , and developers who once fought such moves now recognize that they can quickly recover any added costs of green development through energy savings , higher rents and higher resale values . Indeed , the advantages of building green are now so widely recognized that the nation 's top real estate manager , Steven Roth of Vornado , recently told an industry group , " If you build a new building that is not green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even more dramatic is the potential that already exists for unlocking more energy from natural gas . According to Lovins , we can save half the natural gas we currently use - while cutting its cost to as little as onetenth its current price - simply through more efficient use . Two-thirds of the savings will come from conserving electricity during peak hours - by relying on existing technology like the so-called " intelligent grid , " which can dim lighting and turn off hot-water heaters in millions of homes and offices on hot summer days . The remaining third will come from switching to more energy-efficient devices , many of which are already on store shelves . Even making a few modest changes in our homes could dramatically curb carbon pollution . Widespread use of new LEDs - light- emitting diodes that are brighter , longer-lasting and ten times more efficient than conventional bulbs - could eliminate up to ten percent of U.S. electricity demand . An even simpler innovation - switching to cold-water laundry detergent - would eliminate enough COi each year to meet eight percent of the U.S. target under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates , would cut natural-gas costs by $50 billion every year - displacing demand for foreign oil without building a single new natural-gas terminal or coal-burning power plant . Finally , a marketplace freed from oil subsidies would tap the energy wealth of biofuels already in use around the world . Brazil has eliminated two-fifths of its gasoline demand with ethanol produced from sugar cane , and American farmers have the capacity to produce 4 million barrels a day of cellulosic ethanol without touching an acre of farmland , simply by harvesting switchgrass that protects topsoil , wildlife habitat and water purity . According to Lovins , the combination of advanced biofuels , fuelefficient cars and better use of natural gas could create more than enough energy to end America 's oil imports from all OPEC countries by 2025 . By 2050 , when all the gas-guzzling cars and trucks currently on the roads will be reduced to scrap metal , we can completely eliminate oil as a fuel source . AGGRESSIVE ACTION BY THE federal government could speed up our transition from oil faster than even the most optimistic predictions outlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national investments in hydrogen fuels , which are more than twice as efficient as hydrocarbons , America could actually export energy from the Great Plains - the " Saudi Arabia of wind . " The Dakotas alone have sufficient wind to make all the hydrogen necessary to run every car and truck on the road in America , at nearly triple the efficiency of gasoline . At the Napa Valley summit , business leaders watched a presentation by John Woolard of BrightSource Energy , which builds large-scale solar power plants . With a level playing field , he boasts , " well be able to power the entire United States on less than one percent of our total land . " But the challenge facing us today is not one of gambling on unproven technologies , or even of choosing among wind or solar or hydrogen or switchgrass as the best way to reduce global warming . Our challenge is to create a rational marketplace - one that serves the broader interests of our nation by unleashing the innovative power of American entrepreneurs to transform our energy economy . Done right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will create an engine of sustainable economic growth for generations . By enabling current technologies to compete with oil , America can triple the efficiency of our cars , trucks and planes , cut our demand for oil and natural gas in half- and walk away more prosperous for our efforts . " Energy independence is possible - and if done correctly , it can fuel economic growth , " says King , the PG &E; executive . This new energy economy will not only save the planet from overheating , it will create jobs in the process . " We need to build a trillion solar panels , " says McDonough , the award-winning architect . " There are four jobs installing solar panels for every manufacturing job in creating them . The Chinese ca n't capture those jobs , because the energy is inherently local . The Chinese ca n't steal our photons . " A new wave of innovation is already taking place all across America . Lee Jensen , a dairy farmer in Elk Mound , Wisconsin , is converting cow manure from his family 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fairbank , a ski resort operator in Hancock , Massachusetts , is building a commercial wind turbine near the summit of Jiminy Peak - a first for a ski resort . And thousands of pioneering homeowners and businesses have installed energy-saving windows , solar panels and compact fluorescent light bulbs , while buying up hybrid-electric cars as fast as they roll off assembly lines . One of the only Americans left behind in this rush of innovation is George W. Bush . The president continues to insist that improving fuel efficiency would hamstring the American economy and give an economic advantage to China , which is exempted from the global-warming reductions laid out in the Kyoto treaty . To the contrary , boosting fuel standards would give us the economic advantage . Efficiency is strength - that was the lesson Detroit did n't learn when Japan used energy-efficient cars to conquer the American automobile market . In 1970 , U.S. automakers had eighty-six percent of the domestic car market , and the Japanese had three percent . Today , Japan has forty percent , while Detroit is at fortytwo percent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between fuel efficiency and a strong economy . Beijing has already passed efficiency standards for automobiles that are so high that many American-made cars can no longer be legally sold in China . Thanks to our inefficiency , we risk losing a market of 1.3 billion people . Rather than using the industrial growth in China and India as an excuse to keep polluting , America should seize the economic opportunity that these emerging markets represent . To support its rapid industrialization , China is building a new coal-fired plant every week - generating unprecedented levels of pollution that threaten the entire planet . If we unleash the innovative power of our own market , the United States could be in a unique position to produce the technologies that China will need to avoid destroying itself . " They are locked on a gerbil wheel , " says Alan Salzman , a venture capitalist with VantagePomt , which is investing heavily in climate-saving technologies . " They have to keep up their growth rate of eleven percent to produce enough jobs every year to avoid political unrest . If we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a carbon-based economy , we face an eco-apocalypse . " Sidebar Oil 's Real Cost Gasoline prices may seem exorbitant at more than three dollars a gallon - but the price at the pump does n't include the estimated $1 trillion that Americans pay each year in hidden costs associated with oil . Some of the off-the-books charges are military ( defending tankers in the Persian Gulf ) . Some are economic ( forfeiting U.S. jobs and tax revenues to overseas oil production , weathering periodic disruptions in oil supplies ) . And some are environmental ( cleaning up oil-related pollution , treating asthma caused by smog ) . If all these taxpayer subsidies were paid at the pump , gas prices would skyrocket by more than $10 a gallon . Sidebar The challenge facing us today is not one of gambling on unproven technologies , or even of choosing among wind or solar or hydrogen . Sidebar Platform for the Planet Five things we must do - today - to stop global warming 1 . Cap Pollution-Now To stabilize the climate , we must immediately cap emissions of greenhouse gases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slashed by eighty percent . The best mechanism to achieve these cuts : establish a global carbon market that allows industry to " trade " emissions . The move would create a profit motive for companies to curb their pollution and would stall liquid coal and other carbon-intensive schemes . 2 . Kill Dirty Coal America gets half of its electricity from coal - which spews 1.5 billion tons of C02 into the atmosphere each year . The solution : an immediate moratorium on new coal plants that do n't safely sequester COz underground . 3 . Build Better Cars Fuel-efficiency standards should be boosted to forty-five miles per gallon for cars and thirty-five miles per gallon for light trucks over the next five years . The technology exists - only Detroit stands in the way . 4 . Ban The Bulb Replacing incandescent light bulbs with new , energy-efficient fluorescents would eliminate more than 150 million tons of CO ? each year and encourage the development of LED lighting . 5 . Free the Meter Make it easier and more profitable for homeowners who install solar panels or wind turbines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By decentralizing the power grid , we can turn every consumer into a clean-energy producer .
