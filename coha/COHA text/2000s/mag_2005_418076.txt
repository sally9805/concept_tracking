Fifteen things you need to know before buying a telescope . // Buying a telescope is a big step , especially if you 're not sure what all those terms - f-ratio , magnification , go-to - mean . So , to eliminate confusion and make sure you understand what you 're buying , here 's what to check out before you write the check out . // A 4-INCH DIAMETER MIRROR has 4 times the light gathering area of a 2-inch diameter mirror . A LARGER SCOPE GATHERS more light , and therefore , you can observe fainter objects . THE FAINTEST STAR you can see through your telescope - " limiting magnitude " - depends on the size of the objective . A star field is shown above through a 2-inch left and a 4-inch ( right ) . // 1 I know telescopes make things appear bigger , but what exactly do they do ? A telescope 's main purpose is to collect light . This property of telescopes allows you to observe objects much fainter than you can see with your eyes alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed the invisible . " 2 When 1 buy my first telescope , will it be complete , or will I have to buy additional items to make it work ? Most telescopes marketed to beginners are complete systems , ready for the sky as soon as you unpack them and perform whatever setup procedures the manufacturer recommends . Some high-end models are sold as " optical-tube assembly only " versions . This means what it says : All you 're purchasing is the optics in the tube - no mount , tripod , or accessories . Refractors usually need a star diagonal because of their design . A star diagonal bends the light from your target object 90 , so without one , you find yourself in some awkward positions when you 're observing objects high in the sky . The star diagonal fits into the telescope 's focuser , and the eyepiece fits into the star diagonal . Most manufacturers that provide complete refractor telescopes include a star diagonal . 3 I 'm interested in observing , but I do n't know which scope to buy . What should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn all you can about telescopes : what types are available ( see " Telescope types " to upper right ) , what manufacturers sell them , and what words describe them . Page through the ads in this issue , and you 'll see a range of what 's available . For each telescope that interests you , visit that manufacturer 's web site . When you 're finished reading this story , refer back to recent issues of Astronomy and carefully read telescope reviews . You may not understand everything discussed in each review , but you 'll get a taste of telescope terminology . By doing this , you 'll learn what 's important to observers when they use a telescope . You 'll get a feel for optical and mechanical quality , ease of use ( including portability ) , extra features , and - perhaps most importantly - which objects the telescope excels on . 4 Is it true that I should purchase binoculars before a telescope ? No . I used to give this advice to beginning amateur astronomers , but not any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site - often proves disappointing to beginners . However , high-quality binoculars are a valuable observing accessory . Large star clusters look great through binoculars , as do the Milky Way band and the Moon . 5 What are the sizes of " small , " " medium , " and " large " telescopes ? I ca n't speak for every reference to small , medium , or large telescopes - these terms are not standardized - but here at Astronomy , when we refer to a " small " scope , we specifically mean a telescope with an aperture ( size of the lens or mirror ) less than 4 inches . The type of scope does n't matter , and neither does the quality . Many small telescopes manufactured today are high-quality instruments I am proud to use . " Medium " telescopes have apertures from 4 to 10 inches . This category is the size most amateur astronomers use . One of the most popular scopes is an 8-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain . Finally , any telescope with a lens or mirror larger than 10 inches is " large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever before . The introduction of Dobsonian mounts is largely responsible for this . Newtonian reflectors coupled to alt-az Dobsonian mounts ( see " Telescope mounts " on next page ) dramatically reduce the prices ( and weights ) of large telescopes from what they would be with a motor-driven , equatorial mount . 6 I 've heard " bigger is better " is true when it comes to telescopes . What are the real advantages of big scopes ? The larger the telescope 's diameter , the more light it will collect . A 4-inch refractor , for example , is a great scope for planets , the Moon , and double stars . I know because I own one , and I would n't part with it for love or money . This size scope , however , is a bit small for deep-sky objects such as nebulae , star clusters , and galaxies . An 8-inch telescope ( it does n't matter what type ) will move you into a new dimension of viewing . The objects you see with an 8-inch scope will reveal more detail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in observing , you 'll crave even larger scopes . This malady among amateur astronomers is known as " aperture fever . " And , yes , I 'm infected . I started many years ago with a 2.4-inch telescope of good quality . I now own a 4-inch refractor and a 12-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain . Am I happy ? Yes . Am I satisfied ? Not even close . I now dream of a 20-inch telescope . I think you get the idea . 7 Is " achromat " different from " apochromat " ? What do the words mean ? Both terms refer to the lens systems used in refracting telescopes . An achromat is a two-lens system . Apochromats also may employ two lenses , but they 're more likely to have three or four . The main difference between achromats and apochromats is the amount of what 's called " excess " color you 'll see on bright objects . Excess color is not a color that 's been added to what you 're viewing . Rather , it usually appears as a purple fringe on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free of excess color . Through an achromat , you 'll see excess color on bright objects like Jupiter , Venus , and the Moon . Many observers can ignore the excess color . Apochromats always are more expensive than comparable achromats , and usually by a sizeable amount . 8 I 've Just purchased a new telescope , and am really excited to use it . What 's the first thing I should do ? Read the operating manual several times , and set up your telescope indoors before you try to set it up outdoors at night . This will familiarize you with the location and operation of any switches , buttons , and levers . Knowing how to use your telescope before you head outdoors will enable you to vise your observing time efficiently . This will be especially helpful for sessions such as the Messier marathon ( locating all Messier objects in one evening ) . 9 Why are objects I view through my telescope upside-down ? Just before the light collected by your telescope 's main lens or mirror enters the eyepiece , it 's flipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , so you see an inverted image . A prism assembly ( usually called an " image erector " ) will re-flip the image , but adding this accessory will cause some light to be lost . And regarding observing , the telescope 's function is to deliver the maximum amount of an object 's light to your eye , so you do n't want to lose light from flipping the image . Besides , keep in mind there 's no up or down in space , and with most objects , you wo n't even know they 're upside-down . 10 Can I use my telescope fat views of earthly objects ? Absolutely ! Many nighttime observers ( usually those with small refractors because of size and portability issues ) also use their telescopes for bird-watching or other nature-watching activities . Plus , think about pictures you 've seen of sailors in centuries past - they almost always are at the bow looking through a telescope . 11 I Would like to buy a telescope , but almost all I see are expensive . Why ? A good telescope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and mechanical controls . Such things are n't cheap . It takes incredibly expensive , highprecision machinery to grind the curves into mirrors or fabricate lenses . Some lenses comprise up to four separate elements , each with two optical surfaces . And the larger the mirror or lens , the bigger and stronger the supporting tube , drive , and tripod have to be . 12 Is there any way for me to " test-drive " a telescope ? Yes . Look in your area for an astronomy Sub , and visit one of its meetings . You 'll find others who enjoy astronomy as much as you and are willing to share information and views through their telescopes . At one of the club 's public or members-only stargazing sessions , you 'll be able to look through many different telescopes in a short period of time . 13 Apart from quality optics , what 's the most important thing in a telescope system ? The mount . You can buy the finest optics on the planet , but if you put them on an undersized or poor-quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No telescope can function in high winds , but a poor mount will transfer vibrations in a light breeze . The mount 's quality also affects the " damp-down " time . This is the interval between when you touch the scope ( to focus , for example ) and when the image in the eyepiece stops moving . Sturdy mounts reduce this to a second or 2 . Bad mounts increase this time to an intolerable length . Mount quality is one more reason to " try before you buy . " 14 Is a " go-to " scope better than one without go-to ? Yes . Once properly set up , a go-to scope ( actually , it 's the telescope 's drive that 's go-to ) will save you lots of time by moving under internal computer control to any object you select . It 's important , however , that you understand how to set up your scope , and that will require you to identify a few bright stars . Use a star chart ( like the one found on page 55 ) to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they make star-hopping to deep-sky objects a thing of the past ( when star-hopping , an observer locates a bright star and proceeds to ever-fainter stars until the target is located ) . 15 Since telescopes are used outside , do they need electricity ? No , but their motor ( go-to ) drives do . In most cases , telescope drives use direct current , which means you can either use batteries or obtain an adapter ( usually you are given an option ) that will allow you to plug into an electrical outlet . Lighten up Always remember the best telescope for you is the one you 'll use the most . If it takes an hour to set up a scope , or if your scope is large , heavy , and difficult to move , you may observe only a handful of times each year . If , on the other hand , your scope is quick to set up or if you can mount it permanently ( or at least its tripod or pier ) , you may use it several times each week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big scope in a closet every time . Sidebar TELESCOPE TYPES The three main types of telescopes use lenses , mirrors , or a combination of both . REFRACTING TELESCOPES use lenses - combining at least two , and as many as four , pieces of glass - as their objective ( the primary light-gathering device ) . REFLECTING TELESCOPES use mirrors to gather and focus light . In a Newtonian reflector - the most common type - light reflects from the primary mirror ( whose surface is ground into a parabola so light comes to a common focus ) . The light strikes a smaller , flat secondary mirror nearthe top of the tube . The light then is bent 90 and enters the eyepiece through a small hole in the tube . CATADIOPTRIC , OR COMPOUND , TELESCOPES incorporate a primary mirror coupled with a corrector lens placed at the front of the tube . The primary mirror 's curve is ground to a simple shape , usually a sphere . Ordinarily , a spherical mirror would introduce aberrations in the viewed image , but the corrector of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirror . Two popular catadioptric telescopes are the Schmidt-Cassegrain and Maksutov-Cassegrain designs. - M.E.B. // Refracting telescope Reflecting telescope Catadioptric telescope Sidebar LET 'S TALK OPTICS The f/4 , f/10 , or f/15 represent a telescope 's focal ratio ( f-ratio ) . Focal ratio is determined by dividing the focal length ( the distance from the objective to where the light comes to a focus ) by the aperture . Here 's an example : A 6-inch telescope has a focal length of 36 inches . To find the f-ratio , divide 36 by 6 . This produces f/6 . Often , the aperture is in inches , but the focal length is given in millimeters . If so , just multiply the inches by 25.4 . To find magnification , simply divide the telescope 's focal length ( fsub o ) by the eyepiece 's focal length ( fsub e ) . For example , if your telescope has a focal length of 1,000mm and you choose a 25mm eyepiece , the magnification will be 40 . Remember , magnification alone is not a good indicator of telescope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any telescope . So , a lowquality scope can have a poorly made eyepiece , and the combination can give high power . But any images viewed through it will look distorted - although they will be magnified as claimed. - M.E.B. Sidebar FINDER SCOPE SETUP Align your finder scope during the day . Most observers take time before each observing session to check their finder scope 's alignment . Here 's how : * Insert a low-power eyepiece in your telescope for initial alignment . * Loosen your scope 's motion-control locks to allow movement . * Move your telescope until you center a distant object ( the top of a transmission tower , tree , building , etc . ) . Focus your scope to view the object . * Lock down your telescope 's motion controls to avoid movement . * Loosen the screw locks on your finder scope 's mounting bracket ( see your telescope 's manual ) , and then position the finder scope so the object that 's centered in your scope also is centered in your finder. * Lock your finder scope into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyepiece in your telescope with one that provides higher magnification , then refine the alignment . Sidebar TELESCOPE MOUNTS // Equatorial mount Altitude-Azimuth mount Fork mount Dobsonian mount Sidebar An equatorial mount moves in two planes , with one axis pointed toward the North Celestial Pole ( NCP ) - a spot in the northern sky near Polaris . With an optional motor drive , you can align the mount to the NCP , and the object you are observing will stay in the field of view . If you 're planning to do long-exposure astrophotography or digital imaging , an equatorial mount is essential . An altitude-azimuth ( alt-az ) mount moves the telescope horizontal and vertical . A camera tripod is a good example of an alt-az mount . It can be difficult to tell an alt-az fork mount from an equatorial fork mount . The difference is an equatorial fork mount lines up with the NCR Fork mounts are popular with compound scopes . You will also find the majority of modern observatories use equatorial fork mounts . A dobsonian mount is an alt-az type specifically made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swivel base and a cradle assembly to hold the telescope tube , has a simple design and is easy to construct ( if you choose to build one yourself ) . - M.E.B.
