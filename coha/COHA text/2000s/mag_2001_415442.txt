An 8-year-old bandages his perfectly good arm , claiming it 's broken . Or he starts limping or says he needs glasses . It 's easy to understand why a child would fantasize about some things-like being able to drive a car or slam-dunk a basketball-but make-believe maladies ? MEDICAL MUSES " There are many reasons a child might pretend something 's wrong with him , " says Jack Herman , Ph.D. , a clinical child psychologist at Pace University , in New York City . Some common ones parents can expect : Attention . He knows that a sprained ankle will get a response from family , teachers , and friends . Camaraderie . Sometimes faking can help him be part of the group . If the coolest kid in class has his arm in a sling , your child may claim that his arm hurts too . Photograph Making a spectacle ? // Avoidance . He ca n't be expected to run fast if he has a bad leg , or go to school with a tummy ache . A show of empathy . A fantasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , perhaps a friend who 's sick or injured . Testing . Most kids in this age range do n't have experience with serious illness or accidents . They may practice at it to see how it would feel and how those around them would react . WHAT TO DO First , make sure your child is n't really ill or hurt or having trouble seeing the blackboard . Do n't be concerned that by treating the situation seriously you 'll encourage the behavior . If this is the first time he 's cried wolf-or if it 's something he does only every once in a while-take it in stride . One quick fix is to turn the tables on him . A child who 's too sick to make his bed certainly is n't well enough to go to a movie ! But if he regularly plays sick , you 'll want to pin down the real issues behind his complaints and find ways to remedy them so that he does n't have to go to such lengths . Does he want attention ? Make sure he gets plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insecure about his abilities ? Help him identify his strengths : Point out that he can swim the width of the pool or that he 's a terrific big brother , for example . Show him ways to express empathy and talk about his fears . With time , your child will no doubt outgrow his penchant for pretense . Until then , go ahead and sign the fake cast or kiss the " hot " forehead-and be glad it 's just makebelieve. - K.M . <p>
