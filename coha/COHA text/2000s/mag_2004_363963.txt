Before the U.S. could begin to help Haiti rebuild its ravaged democracy last week , it first had to remove a raving demagogue . Not President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , who had already resigned on Feb. 29 and flown to asylum in Africa . Now the headache was Guy Philippe , whose rebel army had forced Aristide out  --  and whose triumphant entry into the capital , Port-au-Prince , lavishly upstaged the simultaneous arrival of hundreds of U.S. Marines . After sweeping the city of Aristide 's armed gangs , the baby-faced Philippe , 36 , declared himself Haiti 's new " commander in chief , " despite the fact that Haiti 's army was disbanded a decade ago . " The country , " he announced , " is in my hands ! " <P> Philippe 's motley force numbered only a few hundred soldiers . But when the rebels moved to arrest Aristide 's Prime Minister , Yvon Neptune , the Americans had had enough . U.S. armored military vehicles surrounded Neptune 's office , and as Philippe supporters massed at the gate , annoyed U.S. officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Afterward , U.S. military commanders called Philippe in and warned that if he did n't disarm he would " be dealt with the same as anyone who gives us hostile interference out there , " says a U.S. official . Philippe publicly agreed , though days later his insurgents were still armed and testing U.S. patience inside the capital and the provinces . Their tin-pot bravado was winning them support on the streets and complicating the U.S. military 's efforts to assert authority in Haiti , where more than 100 people have been killed in the political violence . <P> This is the third time since 1915 that American soldiers have had to clean up a mess in Haiti . The hemisphere 's poorest nation does n't pose the kinds of dangers that U.S. soldiers face in Iraq . But , like Philippe himself , Haiti can be a p.r . nuisance for any U.S. Administration that intervenesa terminally failed state that often inflicts collateral damage on America 's image as an exporter of democratic institutions . As more than 2,000 U.S. , French and other international peacekeeping troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to forget that Haiti 's newest crisis resulted in part from the U.S. 's meager effort when it last intervened there . That was in 1994 , when 20,000 U.S. troops restored Aristide to power after his first presidency had been aborted by a brutal military coup three years earlier . Says retired U.S. Army Lieut . General Joseph Kinzer , who headed 6,000 U.N . troops in Haiti in 1995-96 : " The U.S. had a year-and-a-half plan for a 10-year operation . " <P> The peacekeeping effort further stretches a taut U.S. military , but not to the breaking point . Pentagon officials are confident they can handle Haiti , but with 120,000 U.S. troops in Iraq and an additional 11,000 on the ground in Afghanistan , the Bush Administration  --  particularly in an election year  --  is n't likely to dispatch more than a few thousand to Haiti for much longer than the three months mandated by the U.N . last week . " We stepped up , and we are the lead elements of the interim force , " said Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haiti before long . But " obviously , we 'd like to see some other country take that lead . "
