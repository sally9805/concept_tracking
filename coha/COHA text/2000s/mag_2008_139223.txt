IN CASE you missed it , and many have , Shea Stadium , the big leagues ' fifth-oldest ballpark , is to be leveled this off-season . " Overshadowed by Yankee Stadium ? You could say that , " says Bob Mandt , the Mets ' former VP for Stadium Operations , who has worked at Shea since its inception . " That 's how it is . It hurts sometimes , but we 're used to it . " // The twin killings are coincidental , though the timing is fitting for Shea , defined over its 44 years in part as the lesser neighbor to baseball 's most hallowed ground . There 's no area at Shea to browse plaques of Hall of Famers ( the Mets , in any event , have just one ) ; no majestic facade ; no 26-title tradition . Shea occupies three acres of un-prime real estate in the stepsister borough of Queens , N.Y. , smack in the flight path of LaGuardia Airport . ( " When I got here , " says Mets infielder Damion Easley , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the house that the boys at Carlin-Crimmins construction built , and if Shea could talk , it would do so in the local vernacular : " Fellas , fuhgeddaboutit . Do n't worry ' bout me . I 've hadda good run . " // A few distinctive features may be preserved when Shea comes down . The mini New York City skyline over the scoreboard ; the fat red apple that rises frivolously out of a top hat when a Met homers . Yet something important will be lost in the dismantling that begins later this month : a place where an identity  --  in which tentative hope braces against deep trepidation  --  was carved . // Shea opened on April 17 , 1964 . Usherettes in seersucker suits greeted fans . Guy Lombardo 's band played . The Sporting News reported that " Almost all among the 50,312 in attendance ... could be heard to gasp such tributes as ' beautiful , ' ' fantastic , ' ' fabulous , ' ' miraculous , ' ' the best ever . ' " // Even then , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million stadium seemed excessive . Yet imagine a desert wanderer describing even a lukewarm glass of water . Shea was an oasis for those abandoned when the Giants and the Dodgers bolted for California in 1957 , fans weaned on Jackie Robinson and Willie Mays who had minted the phrase " Wait till next year ! " and shouted it every October after the Yankees had won again until , in ' 55 , next year finally arrived . Though the losing in the early years was prodigious , attendance grew . Shea was " an alternative to the cold , machinelike excellence of the Yankees , " observed Bill Veeck in ' 64 . From the start , folks liked to say , " I 've been a Mets fan all my life . " // Shea has worn over the years . Its cantilevered stands and narrow aisles seem outdated , its sight lines poor . Though Shea is painted the deep blue of the Mets ' color scheme , many fans call it , affectionately , " the big purple dump . " // " But it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It holds their memories . " // Of this : the Miracle Mets of 1969 ; the Mets who rallied to the World Series behind reliever Tug McGraw 's Ya got ta believe ! mantra in ' 73 ; the ' 86 Mets , who with an extraordinary revival in Game 6 of the Series ( Mookie Wilson , Bill Buckner ) seemed to validate that decade 's slogan : The Magic Is Back . Shea is where baseball held its first game in New York after the 9/11 attacks . Mike Piazza won it with a home run that sent a ripple through the sport . " The only game in my career I did not mind losing , " says Braves manager Bobby Cox . " That night belonged to this place . " // The losing has been equally vital to the lore . The Mets are often " Amazin ' , " an adjective affixed  --  and meant ironically  --  by Casey Stengel in the 1960s . At Shea the past is ever present , in corny slogans , in happy-go-lucky Mr. Met walking the stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a given but a gift . // Shea has hosted others of course . The Jets were tenants from 1964 through ' 83 ; Joe Namath 's Super Bowl III team sprang from Shea . The Beatles came in ' 65 , playing a 30-minute set before 55,000 crazed fans . " Oh , that was wild , " says Pete Flynn , a groundskeeper who drove the band out of the stadium . When Paul McCartney returned to Shea this July , to play at Billy Joel 's farewell concert , he needed a ride again , this time to the stage in a golf cart through Shea 's weathered tunnels . Flynn , still working the grounds , still keeping the infield three quarters of an inch high , still chalking the base paths , provided the lift . " I told Paul McCartney , ' Welcome back . ' " // The new park , Citi Field , opens in April and is designed to evoke Ebbets Field , the Dodgers ' old home . Fans will walk through tall archways into the Jackie Robinson Rotunda . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 'll be fancy food prepared by star chefs . The building will cost some $800 million . Ticket prices have soared . " Sure , I 'm sorry to see Shea go , " says Willie Rodriguez , a sheet-metal worker from Bay Shore , Long Island . Rodriguez is 47 , born in Queens . He comes to a half-dozen games a year . " We all grew up here . But I 'll go to games in the new place  --  if I can afford it . I mean , I 've been a Mets fan all my life . "
