Pleasure myself with a one- armed man ? " the wench had whined . " ' Tis n't likely . " But half a chilly night and a full skin of wine later , she chanted a different tune . And I was forgetting that I was half a man . <p> <p> Until someone grabbed me about the neck and lifted me from between her legs . <p> <p> Until someone flung me across the hut , and I crumpled against the stone and stick wall . <p> <p> My attacker first appeared as a fuzzy shape , and anger welled up in me as I shook my head to clear it and the figure became better defined . Then he spoke , and the anger filled my throat and threatened to choke off my breath . " It does not surprise me , " the tall , bearded man said with a frown , " to find you wasting yourself with a drunken wench .

He tossed a woolen wrap at the girl and motioned sharply at the door . Silly wench was blubbering by then , scared witless of Arthur , and she scampered out of the hut and into the foul night . <p> <p> " I have no need of you , " I answered , groping for the goatskin . But he snatched it from my grasp and poured the wine onto the ground . <p> <p> " You wound me , my lord . " <p> <p> " You wound me , Malgwyn . Quit sniveling and come with me . " His voice changed , perhaps unnoticeable to others , but I had warred with him through too many battles and knew that it portended trouble . " There has been a death , " he said , dropping his chin to his chest . <p> <p> I am called Malgwyn ap Cuneglas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss that my mother laid on my newborn brow . I was born to a farmer near the river Yeo , a man <p> <p> from the west country named Cuneglas . He died when I was but ten years old and my mother when I was seventeen , the year I took to wife Gwyneth , the daughter of my neighbor . She was fifteen and the loveliest lass in our lands . For five years life was as good as I could ask . We farmed and lived and loved . For a while . <p> <p> Arthur was not king then , but rather the " Dux Bellorum , " the general of generals , for Ambrosius Aurelianus and a handful of lesser kings scattered throughout the land . The kings had made an uneasy alliance with the Saxons to fight the Picts , and then the treacherous dogs betrayed us . To Arthur the kings turned ; I knew him then only as a whisper on the wind , a story made larger in the telling , of a great warrior who laid a hundred Saxons low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly , I paid him no mind . Troop levies had not been made in our region . The Saxons were many leagues away from our lands , and the people found no fear of them ; they had once been our allies . <p> <p> Until . <p> <p> Until they turned on us , one cool morn while the men of our village were off to market to sell our produce . Until our return brought us death and destruction . As we rounded the road to our village , instead of finding our families eagerly awaiting our return , we discovered our huts destroyed , smoking , burning . We found our women raped and our babies killed . Searching the rubble that had been my home , I found Gwyneth , her legs aspraddle and her throat slit . Our girl , Mariam , still in her first year , had hidden in a storage pit . For a wonder , they had not found the child . I suspected that Gwyneth hid her there when she heard the Saxons come . I took her from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was moist with my grief . <p> <p> The next day I took her to my brother 's home in Castellum Arturius  --  the town was too large for a simple raiding party  --  and left her with him . With other men of my village , we mounted our horses and rode to find Arthur , to join him . <p> <p> I did not cry again . <p> <p> I smiled at each Saxon throat I cut . I smiled at each rotting Saxon body we left on the battlefield . My fellows thought it odd that I smiled so much at death and devastation , and after a while they called me " Smiling Malgwyn . " They did not understand that the smile ate at me like a disease . <p> <p> Arthur saw something in me though . Before one battle , I sat on my horse on a ridge and studied the land before us . Another horse rode up alongside , and I took it for one of my fellows . " If Arthur is smart , " I said , " he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My finger pointed out low hills . " When the Saxons ride to face our main force , they will be trapped with their backs to the river . " <p> <p> " I agree , " a deep voice said . Arthur . " You are Malgwyn ap Cuneglas . " <p> <p> " Yes , my lord , " I said , turning quickly and giving the salute , surprised almost as much by his sudden appearance as by the fact that he knew me . <p> <p> He nodded , smiled faintly , turned his horse and left . Within minutes , the troop dispositions were made as I had suggested . When the Saxons made their charge , the course of battle ran just as I predicted . We crushed a large Saxon force , shoving the last survivors into the river to drown . I was given my own troop of horse to command and a place in the war councils . <p> <p> Had I known then what that brief encounter portended , I would have killed him there . It would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> Arthur 's odd pronouncement cleared my eyes , and I began to focus . I yearned to return to the wine and the wench , but the set of his jaw made me want to know more . <p> <p> " Death is a constant of this life , my lord , " I observed . " It is all around us . Why is this one different ? " <p> <p> Arthur lowered himself onto a stool that I had lashed together out of an armload of trimmed branches and scraps of leather . He was dressed as a common man , in a woolen tunic hanging down nearly to his knees and tied at the waist with a leather belt , and braccae . His huge feet were covered with leather shoes laced across the top in the Celtic manner . He liked to go abroad in peasant 's garb , without the fine linen camisia his wealth and station afforded him . A dagger protruded from his belt , and I suspected that one or more of his men lingered in the darkness outside my hovel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was found dead an hour ago in the lane . She was lying outside Merlin 's home . " <p> <p> " Ravaged ? " I gathered my own braccae and slid them on . In front of any other man , I would have been humbled , but we had shared too many campfires to worry about such niceties . <p> <p> " That is not for me to say , but the poor child was gutted like a deer , slit from throat to belly . " <p> <p> " Odd . But why does the death of a serving girl disturb the great Lord Arthur ? " <p> <p> " There was a knife lying by her body , covered in blood . It belongs to Merlin . " <p> <p> And that explained it all . Merlin , though some called him Myrddin hereabouts , was a harmless old man , a councillor to Ambrosius Aurelianus and Arthur 's old teacher at Dinas Emrys , where Arthur was schooled . He came from a town in the far north , Moridunum in Roman days , Carmarthen now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prophets , whose deeds gave rise to the town 's name , which meant " inspiration " in our tongue . <p> <p> Once he had given good counsel , but the years had played tricks on his mind , and he thought himself a sorcerer now and sold potions made of valerian root to the gullible . When he was in his right mind , he could cut through the thickets choking a problem and strike at the root of the matter . And , Arthur loved the old cantankerous fool . <p> <p> The wine 's magic was beginning to fade and a pain grew in the back of my head as I , now dressed , rested on my haunches . " So , your much touted devotion to justice is now about to betray you ? What of it ? You are Lord Arthur . You are as good as crowned as the Rigotamos . Do as you please . No one will argue . " <p> <p> " You know I can not do that . Vortimer , David , Mordred , and the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a litter of unruly pups , and they are always looking for some reason to challenge my ascent to the throne . " David , a lord of the northern lands , the Votadini , was one of a number of cagey warriors , ambitious and sly . And while Arthur still championed the Christ , Vortimer , and a handful of other lords led a growing movement of those who believed our troubles came because we strayed from the old gods . <p> <p> The pain in the back of my neck grew even stronger , and I rubbed it with my one hand . " Go away , my lord . I am no help to you , and even if I could be , give me one reason that I should come to your aid . " <p> <p> Arthur rose and crossed the hut , kneeling in front of me and resting his hand on my shoulder . I looked up into his eyes and saw a sadness in their depths . " The murdered girl is Eleonore , your wife 's sister . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight of what he said fall upon me . Eleonore , a warm and wonderful girl . I remembered her as a child , not yet in her teens , helping my Gwyneth with our Mariam , not long , it seemed , before I found Gwyneth bloodied and Mariam hiding . <p> <p> Damned Saxons ! They could n't have done it ; this I knew . But I wanted someone to blame , and if I did n't know who committed the deed , they would serve to fill the role . Or maybe I blamed them for making me less than a man . Arthur and I had done for many of them . But that was before , before the other had happened . And for that , I could blame Arthur . <p> <p> A man without a limb had no place in our world . ' T was better to be born with some deformity , for then you might be marked as blessed by the gods , or cursed by them . But one who has lost a limb was given no such choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the afterlife and most considered it a punishment for some sin or a cruel nature . Aye , many believed that a man so marked could not ascend to heaven , was doomed to wander the underworld . Such a man could never be a king , for only perfection in a king was acceptable . Losing my arm cost me not only its use but marked me as cursed by the gods both in life and out . <p> <p> It had happened along the river Tribuit ; we battled with an exceedingly large force of Saxons . I remember that it was a pretty morning , but the songs of birds did not grace our ears , rather the clank of metal on metal and that awful , indescribable sound of rent flesh . The enemy had nearly overwhelmed our brave force with their stout spears , lances , and swords , and a handful of us were surrounded on a grassy knoll that sloped into the river . <p> <p> The more desperate our situation became , the more frenzied the thrust and parry of my sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with only three of my fellows left , I realized this was the end of my vengeance , the end of my smiles , a reality driven home when a Saxon blade cleaved my right arm at the elbow . <p> <p> I fell in the blood- dampened grass , my severed member lying with the hand toward me as if imploring me to join it , and waited for peace to come , for my chance to rejoin Gwyneth . But as darkness grew around me , I sensed someone fumbling at the stump of my arm , a leather strap tied taut to stanch the flow of scarlet . As I cried in protest , I was lifted up and placed on a horse ; a voice whispered in my ear , " No warrior such as you will waste his life 's blood if I can prevent it . " It was Arthur . <p> <p> For days I was delirious with fever and exhaustion , near to death I was told . I awoke two weeks later with the brothers of the small abbey at Ynys-witrin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their care . The brothers liked Arthur not and he cared not for them , but they respected each other , and Arthur knew my wound would need careful attention if I were to survive . <p> <p> Survive , what a hateful word . <p> <p> When I awoke and realized what I had lost , the last thing I wanted was to survive . Gwyneth gone . The farm gone . Half an arm gone . I cursed Arthur for saving me , cursed him for not letting me die on the battlefield , bathing in Saxon blood . I struggled with learning to write my letters . The brothers had suggested the task as a way to keep my mind active , to strengthen my left hand and arm , and to give me a trade , that of the scribe . But for me it was just something to fill my time , to push out thoughts of Gwyneth and the Saxons and a war that had seen Arthur rise high while others lost everything . <p> <p> The great man visited me once , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice from the door . <p> <p> " Good for something that once was a man , " I had answered without turning , already knowing who it was , continuing to scratch the quill across the parchment . <p> <p> " That is true only if you believe it yourself . " <p> <p> " That is what you and your church say , and the Druids as well . " <p> <p> " Yet , the brothers here have cared for you , " Arthur retorted . <p> <p> " They are kind . " <p> <p> " Perhaps you should learn some of that kindness . " <p> <p> " For what purpose , my lord ? " I spat out the words as though they were sour wine . <p> <p> " In order to turn it upon yourself . You act as a man who has done some great wrong and can not forgive himself . Be kind to yourself . You deserve it . " <p> <p> " And what should I tell my men , the ones you dragged me from , the ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> " That their time had come and yours had not . That God had more plans for you . " <p> <p> " You are not God , my lord ! But you are the archpriest of bastards and the spawn of vermin . " In any other time and place that would have earned me a quick death . But Arthur had merely laughed . I think back now and realize that my words were so venomous because Arthur 's were so true . And I think he knew that then . <p> <p> " Learn your lessons well , and keep your mind sharp . I may have need of you again . " <p> <p> He was gone before I could tell him to leave me alone forever . <p> <p> But though I heeded his words about learning my letters , I kept my mind anything but sharp , except for one irritating puzzle at the monastery that drew me from my melancholy . I learned my letters , and with something of a trade , I returned to Castellum Arturius , intent on making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next life . <p> <p> I scratched the stubble on my face as I considered Arthur 's expression and a burning that was building in my belly . <p> <p> We had seen each other little from that time to this . Now , Ambrosius was the Rigotamos , and Cadwy and the rest were but memories , old men who bored guests with their tales of battles gone by , for the Saxons ' advance had been checked for a time . Ambrosius was readying to step down , and the cloak of leadership seemed poised to fall to Arthur . I watched from afar as he rose high in the esteem of the people , and now he sought election as the acknowledged overlord , the Rigotamos , the high king of the Britons . It was a time of relative peace as the Saxons stayed in the lands of the Cantii and left our western fields and villages alone . And I lived alone in my little hut , drinking , trying to forget I 'd ever heard of Arthur . <p> <p> Eleonore , such a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the castle in recent days , and she showed a love for life that knew no bounds . I could not imagine her cold and white with death , as I had seen her sister , my beloved . It was as if Arthur had brought death to my family again and had saved me to bear witness to it . With a great effort , I pushed myself to my feet and brushed Arthur 's hand from my shoulder , meeting him eye to eye and not yielding an inch . " Listen to me , my lord . Mark you this and mark it well : I will have the truth of it , no matter where it leads . Even if that crazy old fool did the killing . She will atone for another of her family who lies unavenged . " <p> <p> My lord drew himself to his full height , fearsome as it was , his eyes blazing . " Do not forget who rules Arthur 's castle . " <p> <p> " Do not forget whom you have sought out , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the guilty one . And should your hand be seen in my inquiries , it will prove what Vortimer and the others are probably already whispering : that the great Arthur , who champions truth and justice and boasts the Cross on his shield , will conveniently forget such things when an old friend is in jeopardy . And that will force Ambrosius to reconsider his support for you . " I chose my words well and knew my target even better . <p> <p> Arthur 's shoulders slumped , and he turned from me . " Of course , you are right . You are a hard man , Malgwyn . But the world needs such as you . Though if any citizen of this kingdom lies unavenged , Malgwyn , it is not Gwyneth . You repaid her death a hundred times over . " <p> <p> " Her death will never be fully avenged . " <p> <p> " Believe as you wish . Come , I 'll show you where it happened . " <p> <p> " Has aught been touched ? " I asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . I knew you needed to see her as she was found . " <p> <p> Outside , people were still moving about in the lanes . This was no ordinary night . The entire consilium , the entire group of lords from all the tribes of Britannia , had come to Arthur 's castle for one purpose and one purpose only  --  to name a new Rigotamos , a new high king to govern over all . <p> <p> Oh , the old Rigotamos was not dead . No , he breathed yet . <p> <p> Most such lords seemed as the one before , one to pay tax to , like all the rest . But Ambrosius was different somehow . He seemed to care about all of the raids by the Saxons , once our allies . " Aye , he has a Roman bearing , that one , " my old man would say , leaning on his hoe at the end of the day . " Yep , him and that young one will stand us in good stead . " By " that young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax collector for Ambrosius . " A good , stout Roman lad , " my father had said . <p> <p> And when I met him one day , I saw that look in his eye , the one you knew you could trust above all else . His name was well known in our family . Rumors flew that he had been the reason that my cousin Guinevere was cast from the women 's community at Ynys-witrin , but few knew the truth of it . A few years later , when we had laid my old father in his grave and the Saxons turned on us , ravaging the land at will , I remembered those eyes , and it was those I sought after the devils butchered Gwyneth when they reduced our village to burning huts and bloodied bodies . That was the beginning ; much came after . <p> <p> Now , Ambrosius was stepping down , and that young officer , the one I had come to trust with my soul yet now hated with all my heart , was said by some to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me at his side most of the time , and his reputation stood high across the land . Ambrosius , fat and rich , had retired to Dinas Emrys , leaving the administration of the various lords to Arthur . But he did not trust his consilium , as well he might not , and worried that some ambitious lord would conspire to kill him and claim the throne for himself . So , by retiring , he removed himself as a target and secured the major voice in choosing his successor . <p> <p> By that time , I could care less , a one- armed drunk , saved from the grave by Arthur and despising him for it every day . He had made me half a man , and robbed me of my love for killing Saxons , that inner love that kept a smile across my face . No , I was no lover of Arthur . <p> <p> It was generally assumed that this meeting of the consilium would confirm Arthur 's choice . Treachery was a way of life , however . By proposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the consilium to secure the selection , Ambrosius could rest easy . I had to wonder at the conjunction of events  --  the consilium 's meeting and Eleonore 's death . Were they somehow connected ? <p> <p> Arthur 's castle was an old fort even then . An ancient village from Roman times was located to the northeast , and it was among those once-fine houses that some of the soldiers made their homes . Lord Cadwy established our fort on old Roman ruins near the land called Camel . The young Arthur would not take the bribes offered by the abbots and monks to ignore their levy . It earned him no friends among the priests , but the common man appreciated his fairness , and he rose to Dux Bellorum for our consilium . When Cadwy died , Arthur claimed his fort near Camel , changing its name to Castellum Arturius . <p> <p> I preferred to be closer to the fort above and lived just beyond the outer gates . Years of use had beaten the main road into more a wide gully than a road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . It led past my door and entered through Roman- style double gates , winding sharply up through the four defensive rings surrounding the fort . The massive rings were made of rock walls , dry- stacked in the old fashion , not mortared like Roman builders would have it , sixteen feet thick and reinforced by strong wooden posts every ten feet or so . Each ring of stone was surmounted by a stout wooden rampart . It would take a massive army or base treachery to defeat the castle 's defenses . <p> <p> Guards stood watch at each ring , but they raised a hand and smiled as they saw Arthur with me . Had he worn his warrior 's regalia , they would have stood and saluted , but they knew that Arthur did not like ceremony when he dressed as a common man . Arthur could be a fierce and passionate warrior , and for this his men loved and trusted him . Trusted him enough that they accepted that he was a true believer in the Christ and carried symbols of Christianity on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the return of the Druids . A good man he was , but no special friend of the clergy , and that endeared his men to him as well . <p> <p> On top of the hill , on the high summit , sat Arthur 's great hall . The . etchers ' workshops , armorers , the great market , and other shops and timbered houses lay spread gloriously out below . A Roman- style barracks occupied the far end of the plateau from the great hall , at the terminus of the wide lane that ran the length of the fort . All was fresh and clean , the lanes all paved with local stone . When Arthur had taken residence at the fort , he launched an extensive rebuilding campaign , paving the lanes , repairing the buildings , and erecting a new hall for himself . <p> <p> As we trudged along the lanes , we encountered few people at this hour , two past the midnight , but as we drew closer to Merlin 's hut , just east of Arthur 's hall , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men pushed for a closer look . <p> <p> The metallic smell of blood hung in the air , like that of a freshly dressed kill in the field . I pushed past the young toughs and through the circle of guards . Eleonore 's face was turned away from me , and I was glad for that . Her tender neck looked like Gwyneth 's , though , and the sight stole my breath from me . From behind I heard a sudden silence and the rustling of bodies as the crowd parted for Arthur . <p> <p> I knelt before her and pulled her clothing back from her stomach . She wore an old- fashioned gown , called a peplos , with a Roman- type cut , favored by Arthur 's circle . A beautiful bronze brooch , shaped like a dolphin , fastened the gown at her shoulder . But when I saw what had been done to her , appreciation for her jewelry . ed and I nearly spewed wine over her . Arthur had been absolutely correct . She was cut from between her breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blood lay splattered about her clothing in gobbets . I took her cold face in my hand and pulled it toward me , and the sight of that familiar face sat me back on my haunches as if I were truly drunk . I began to heave again as the bile flooded my throat . This time I could n't hold it back and my evening 's drink splashed all over the cobblestones . She had her sister 's face , almost my wife 's twin , and seeing her like this was like kneeling in my hut , desolate , so many moons before . For a moment , all around me disappeared , and I felt the rage and revulsion of Gwyneth 's death sweep over me again . It was as if I knelt over her still ravaged remains ; it was as if she had died once more . My bile heaved and my heart tightened ; until , that is , some wag behind me chuckled . <p> <p> " His lordship not only brought a one- armed drunk to investigate the crime , but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as yellow as his belly is weak . " I did n't recognize the speaker , but I knew that he was a follower of one of the lords of the consilium , a young buck with less common sense than experience and of that not much at all . <p> <p> I paused to see if Arthur would answer this insolence , but he stood curiously silent , perhaps waiting to see what I would do . I knew too that this was Arthur 's way of checking my worth . We had some old warriors about the villages and towns , missing hands , feet , but those who suffered such wounds mostly died from loss of blood or the stinking , choking putrefaction that followed . Those who survived , like me , were left to begging , pleading for a scrap of bread or a jug of wine , losing the last of their pride . A one- armed man served little purpose in any world . Farming required two hands as did most other jobs . Men with one arm had no purpose , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a trade to keep me from begging , but he could not return my arm . And now he would see how I had adapted to that loss . <p> <p> I handled it swiftly , my anger at the child 's death venting on the heckler . With a speed that shocked all who saw , I grabbed the feeble throat of the boy and , in one move , lofted him off the ground and pinned him against the wall of Arthur 's hall . His eyeballs bulged as I remorselessly cut off his breath . <p> <p> " As you can see , I need but one arm and one hand to stifle your childish mewlings . " I let him drop to the ground , and he clutched his throat . " Another word from you and you 'll be as dead as that girl . " Coughing and hacking , he scuffled away from me across the cobblestones . " Now , go , before I change my mind and end your miserable life . " <p> <p> I spun around and fixed the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care to test my spine ? " <p> <p> The young ones took a step back , without knowing it , it seemed . But not Vortimer , who stepped out so that I could see him . He and I had shared a battle.eld or two in our time . <p> <p> Bearded with a thick chest , he had not the height of Arthur , or the honesty . The slyness in his eyes worried me , for I could not read him as well as I could read other men . <p> <p> " Go on now , the rest of you ! Get to your homes , " ordered the captain of the guard . The handful of others slowly dispersed , leaving me with the guards and Arthur , and , of course , Eleonore . <p> <p> " Bring those torches in closer , " I directed . The glowing , dancing globes of light drew in about me until I could see all too clearly what evil the murderer had wrought on the poor girl . <p> <p> She looked so different now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had been but a child when Gwyneth and I were wed . The youngest of the children , she had been doted upon by her parents . Gwyneth often chided them for spoiling her , but both she and I did our share of the spoiling . Eleonore had bright , inquisitive eyes , and when she visited us , as she was wont to do , she would climb into my lap and beg me to tell her stories . How she would listen to those stories , with those beautiful eyes sparkling . But the sparkle was gone now , . ed with the . re of life that had once filled her , replaced with the dull glaze of death . I shivered and steeled myself for the task ahead . <p> <p> The blood I had first noticed now seemed less marked . There was much , to be sure , but not as much as one would expect from such a wound . No great puddles lay on the cobblestones , and yet the knife had ripped through her body , severing all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single- edged blade , lay beside her , and it was covered with her blood and bits and pieces of her flesh . The great , gaping wound could easily have been made with such a weapon . <p> <p> Still , something bothered me . I brushed the hair back from her face and neck and saw immediately the knife had not killed her . Bruises showed on her pale neck , in the shape of fingers , and small splotches , where blood had burst to the surface and appeared around her white eyes . <p> <p> Eleonore had been strangled to death . <p> <p> No blood had sprayed the lane because her heart had quit pumping before her body had been ripped open . I had seen similar wounds on the battlefield , where a blunt blow to the head had killed , and a later sword thrust produced no great gouts of blood . Why would the killer have mutilated her so when she was already dead ? <p> <p> I motioned for the guards to draw closer with their torches , and , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound more closely . A quick survey led me to realize two facts : the blood I had sought on the lane was not pooled in her body cavity , another sign that she had been dead when this butchery had been done , and something more disturbing than the poor girl 's identity could ever be . <p> <p> Her heart was missing . <p> <p> With all the will I possessed , I strengthened myself and slid my hand into her body , shifting lungs , stomach , but where the heart should have been were those great , severed tunnels and an empty spot . An old monk at Ynys- witrin taught me what I know of a person 's insides . It was another of those studies I performed to help forget my missing arm . Preparing the bodies of the brothers for burial had fallen to this old man . He had studied the human body carefully and knew it well . The other brothers were reluctant to touch a dead body , a superstition dating back to Roman days , but one no more necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I had heard tell of priests and ritual purifications , necessities to be performed before a body could be touched . We worried little about that sort of thing in these days . Now , sitting back on my heels , I studied the blood covering my hand , drying into a mortal glove , and tried to think of some reason for this . Rape . Yes , I understood rape . But this was different . <p> <p> To be certain , I drew her skirts up and examined her womanhood . No tears , no scrapes , no blood , no bruises , nothing . No reason to think she had been raped or even that she had submitted willingly . I had heard enough in the lanes to know that she had her admirers , those who would pay court to her . Kay was one . I had also seen the look of hunger that young Tristan had given her at the feasting that night . He would bear questioning , as would Kay . <p> <p> " Malgwyn ! " a voice hissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an expression of disfavor on his face . " Her honor , Malgwyn . Leave her something ! " <p> <p> " Her honor is gone with her life 's breath , old friend . And if studying the most private part of her is the path to her killer , then I must follow that lane wherever it leads . " I shook my head , replacing her skirts and smoothing them . " However , that is not the reason this time . " <p> <p> " She was not abused ? " Kay asked . He was an exceptionally tall man , and I was forced to stretch my neck to look up at his face , as I was stocky and of medium height . <p> <p> " No . There is something else awry here . Where is Merlin ? " <p> <p> " I had him taken to the barracks and tied to a post to keep him out of trouble , " answered Arthur , more loudly than I thought necessary considering the hour , but I suspected he wanted all to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In other circumstances , I would have laughed at Arthur 's sometimes overwhelming desire to seem fair and just . What man with power in this day and age was either ? But this was not a night for jests . <p> <p> " And your other servants , my lord ? The ones that this girl worked with . I 'll need to speak to them as well . " <p> <p> " As you wish , " Arthur said with a flourish , more for the benefit of his followers , Kay , Bedevere , and the others . He knew that I 'd do as I pleased regardless . " You have my full authority in this matter . " <p> <p> " Thank you , my lord . " <p> <p> " I will leave you to your work , " Arthur answered . " But , Malgwyn ? " <p> <p> " Yes , my lord . " <p> <p> " Be quick about it . " Arthur left abruptly , returning to his hall . <p> <p> His tone left nothing to the imagination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less chance Merlin would have , and Arthur 's chances to be Rigotamos would dwindle . The people would demand Merlin 's punishment , and for this there could be only one choice . <p> <p> Arthur loved the old man like a father , and he would hesitate to have him executed , hesitate until the people began to ponder whether he had the strength to rule . As soon as Arthur lost his popular support , the other nobles would pressure Ambrosius to stop championing him as the new Rigotamos , leaving the field open . <p> <p> " Are you finished with the body ? " a new voice asked , one that was as familiar to me as my own . I turned toward the grim face of my younger brother , Cuneglas , named for our father . <p> <p> He was turned differently , was my brother . He had no liking for the farmer 's life and became a thatcher in Arthur 's castle . Though I started out as a farmer , fate and the Saxons had robbed me of that life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monks at Ynys- witrin , I made good money , more than I ever had as a farmer , by writing or copying documents . And so I had spent my days , when the light was good , copying or writing , and my nights drinking to blot out the blackness of my sunny days . My brother and I were not close ; we saw each other but seldom . Like our father , he had a gruff bearing , cast by his nature to be sarcastic , and his company was not pleasant . My days were dark enough without allowing him to darken them further with his melancholy moods . A big part of the matter with me had to do with my embarrassment at leaving my child with him and Ygerne , his wife . At first , I was so besotted with revenge that I could think of nothing but seeing her cared for and out of danger so that I might pursue my own mission . Then , when my wound cost me my arm and I turned to drink to blot the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , not a cripple . So , I stayed away and let my brother see to her raising . Occasionally , I would slip them some money ; I spent a little on drink and less on food . <p> <p> Cuneglas and another man began moving Eleonore . I rarely saw my brother . Indeed I saw his wife , Ygerne , more frequently , and Mariam , my daughter , until recent days  --  before Mariam stopped speaking to me . But that was my fault , for shirking my responsibility and leaving her to be raised by them . <p> <p> " It is good to see you , brother , " I stuttered somewhat lamely , not meaning it . My hand flew to my empty sleeve , attempting to hide unconsciously what I could not keep from his view . <p> <p> " Would that another reason had brought us together , " he replied . <p> <p> I had no answer , and I knew that he expected none . A thought struck me , though , now that he had asked about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one more detail . " Kneeling beside her again , I held her hands up and saw that a bit of cloth was clenched in one fist . I needed to look at it , but the cloth was held tight in her death grip . " Cuneglas . Please , help me here . " <p> <p> With his two good hands , he pried her fingers apart enough for me to pull the cloth out . It was dark , heavy wool cloth , the type worn by peasants and not uncommon among the Picts . Of itself , it meant nothing . Folk even of Arthur 's rank would wear such cloth as an outer garment , covering their precious skin with imported linen beneath . That it was torn and clenched in her fist did offer a clue . She had struggled with her killer . <p> <p> I checked her fingernails and found some streaked blood on the nails of the hand that clenched the scrap , but I could n't be sure if it was her own or her assailant 's . No flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't marked the killer . <p> <p> Excerpted from THE KILLING DAY by TONY HAYS Copyright 2009 by Tony Hays Published in April 2009 by Tom Doherty Associates ,
