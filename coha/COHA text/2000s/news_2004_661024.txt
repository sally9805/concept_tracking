<p> Sam Spade unraveled the mystery of the Maltese Falcon . Now his nonfictional alter ego is snooping into a real treasure-gone-missing caper : the Maltese moon rock . <p> Only about the size of a pea , the dull-gray specimen was plucked from the lunar surface by Apollo astronauts , embedded in a clear acrylic ball , and given to Malta . Last month , the acrylic ball and rare rock inside it disappeared from its display in a Mdina museum . <p> Malta 's lunar larceny fits a global trend , some experts say . In 1973 , President Nixon gave nearly identical moon-rock fragments as " goodwill " gifts to 135 nations . Today nobody , including NASA , seems to know the exact whereabouts of most of those fingernail-sized samples . <p> They could be in a museum display or a dictator 's desk drawer or , as in Canada , gathering dust in a museum storage room . And they 're extremely valuable - potentially worth millions of dollars each . <p> And the Malta theft has reignited interest in moon rocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first moon landing on July 20 - along with a sizzling market for space collectibles overall . <p> " I would not be surprised if half of those 135 moon rocks have been stolen , or lost , or are now in a position where they could be stolen , " says Joseph Gutheinz , a former investigator for NASA 's Office of Inspector General . " I 've been contacting museums around the world , and I 'm not having responses I would have expected . There 's no real sense that any but a few of these moon rocks can be accounted for . " <p> From con men to strongmen , college students to collectors , many have sought to buy , sell , or steal a piece of the moon . Mr. Gutheinz , who retired in 2000 from NASA , has been involved in investigating several moon-rock capers - and knows details about even more . <p> In 2002 , three NASA interns stole a 600-pound safe with reportedly about 3.5 ounces of moon rocks inside , valued at tens of millions of dollars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Internet , but were reported to authorities . All were tried and convicted , says Gutheinz , who was not on that case . <p> But Gutheinz did investigate the case of another goodwill moon rock that went missing from Honduras in the early 1990s . It resurfaced in 1998 while Gutheinz was running a sting operation dubbed " Operation Lunar Eclipse " to ferret out fakes . A United States citizen tried to sell a moon rock in its acrylic shell complete with plaque for $ 5 million . Unfortunately for him , the " buyer " turned out to be Gutheinz in his undercover role , posing as a rich collector . The rock was seized by federal agents and returned to Honduras . <p> That was n't the end , though . The dealer argued in federal court he was the rightful owner , having purchased the ball for $ 50,000 from a retired Honduran military official . It became one of the most strangely named cases in US legal history : " United States of America vs . One Lucite Ball Containing Lunar Material . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Honduras was the lawful owner , not the dealer , who was not charged . The rock made its formal return to Honduras in a February ceremony . Today , Gutheinz is on the hunt for US moon rocks given to Afghanistan , Nicaragua , Nigeria , Niger , Gabon , Republic of Congo , Romania - and Malta . He fears , though , that the Afghanistan moon rock might have been destroyed , or even sold by the Taliban regime to fund government operations or terrorism . <p> Lest there be any ambiguity when it comes to lunar pebbles , NASA would like to make one thing clear : You ca n't legally own one - not yet , anyway . In 2000 , Congress introduced legislation to permit astronaut moon-rock ownership - and new moves in this direction are rumored . <p> For now , all the goodwill rocks belong to the countries honored by President Nixon . The rest - less than 1,000 pounds ' worth - are owned by NASA . That scarcity and restriction make a moon rock like the one from Malta potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as innocent-but-ignorant sellers who think they have a moon rock , today pose another big challenge for NASA 's lunar sleuths . In 1995 , for instance , two brothers tried to auction a fake moon rock , claiming it was a gift from an astronaut to their late father , a former NASA worker . The brothers were reportedly caught when the auction house queried NASA and was told even astronauts ca n't own a moon rock . <p> Just a few months ago NASA confiscated a moon rock being offered on eBay which turned out to be fake , says Gary Lofgren , NASA 's moon-rock curator . And recently , Dr. Lofgren was shown a sample that a major auction house had planned to place on the block last week . <p> " I had to tell them it was not a lunar sample , " he says . <p> Goodwill rocks aside , the vast majority of lunar rocks are safe . NASA keeps its moon rocks under lock and key , and all but about 1 ounce of its 842 pounds of the rocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounted for , the space agency says . Dr. Lofgren 's computerized inventory tracks every stone loaned out for scientific research or exhibit . What about that missing 1 ounce ? It got lost in the mail , Lofgren says . <p> Apollo moon rocks are n't the only ones that have journeyed to Earth . Russia 's three robotic lunar missions returned about 3/4 of a pound of specimens . And , in the only known legitimate moon-rock sale , Sotheby 's in 1993 auctioned off three specks of Russian moon rock , weighing less than 1/100ths of an ounce , for $ 442,000 , says Robert Pearlman , editor and founder of collectSPACE.com , a source for space-memorabilia enthusiasts . <p> But the Apollo moon rocks are the most desirable because of the emotional connection millions of people made when they watched on TV as astronauts collected the rocks , Mr. Pearlman says . He notes that the market for space collectibles has boosted interest in moon rocks . A piece of Apollo gravel weighing 4/100ths of an ounce would be conservatively worth $ 1 million , Pearlman estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diamond that size . <p> Like Gutheinz , Pearlman worries that many museums do n't realize the value of the moon rocks Nixon gave as gifts three decades ago . So he , too , has begun a project to find the goodwill moon rocks - tracking down just 16 so far . <p> Disappointed , he reports several moon rocks on display but without any serious security arrangements , while others gather dust in storage . Still others are long gone , he says . News reports in 1998 , for instance , suggested that Romania 's moon rock may have been auctioned off with the possessions of former dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu . <p> For his part , Pearlman eagerly awaits the day when large loads of moon rocks are brought back by private space ventures for individual ownership . Until then , aficionados must content themselves with tektites - small , glassy bodies found in isolated places around the world and worth about 50 cents at any rock shop . Such specimens could be from the moon - or from meteorites - but nobody knows for sure , Pearlman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the moon , albeit an ephemeral one . Apollo astronaut turned artist Alan Bean sprinkles lunar particles onto his paintings , culled from dust that stuck to his spacesuit . Other moon flecks have been given as NASA retirement gifts - including a 1-inch piece of transparent tape covered with moon dust , which the recipient cut up and auctioned off . Pearlman paid $ 5,000 for a tiny piece of moon tape - and he was not the only one . <p> The magic of moon particles seems to act like pixie dust on collectors . " If I ca n't visit the moon , at least I can hold a piece of it in my hand , " Pearlman says . " My ultimate hope is that someday I will be able to own a moon rock myself . " <p> Until then , as Sam Spade might say , it appears that moon rocks remain the stuff that dreams are made of . <p> Moon-rock memorabilia <p> * From 1969-72 , six Apollo moon missions collected 842 pounds of rocks , core samples , pebbles , sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notable absence of water forged the three types of moon rocks : basalts ( lava rocks ) , anorthosites ( light rocks ) , and breccias ( composite rocks ) . Unlike soggy Earth , the moon has no sandstones , shales , or limestones . <p> * On its last manned flight to the moon , NASA finally sent a true rock hunter - geologist Harrison Schmitt . Unsurprisingly , Apollo 17 brought back more rock samples than any other mission to the moon . <p> * Were it legal to sell one , a one-gram moon pebble ( less than 4/100ths of an ounce ) would fetch $ 1 million or more - while a top-quality diamond of equal size commands a relatively modest $ 250,000 . <p> SOURCES : NASA , DiamondRegistry.com <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
