PROLOGUE The Interview Every season of my nanny career kicked off with a round of interviews so surreally similar that I 'd often wonder if the mothers were slipped a secret manual at the Parents League to guide them through . This initial encounter became as repetitive as religious ritual , tempting me , in the moment before the front door swung open , either to kneel and genuflect or say , " Hit it ! " No other event epitomized the job as perfectly , and it always began and ended in an elevator nicer than most New Yorkers ' apartments . *** The walnut-paneled car slowly pulls me up , like a bucket in a well , toward potential solvency . As I near the appointed floor I take a deep breath ; the door slides open onto a small vestibule which is the portal to , at most , two apartments . I press the doorbell . Nanny Fact : she always waits for me to ring the doorbell , even though she was buzzed by maximum security downstairs to warn of my imminent arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . May , in fact , have been standing there since we spoke on the telephone three days ago . The dark vestibule , wallpapered in some gloomy Colefax and Fowler floral , always contains a brass umbrella stand , a horse print , and a mirror , wherein I do one last swift check of my appearance . I seem to have grown stains on my skirt during the train ride from school , but otherwise I 'm pulled together -- twin set , floral skirt , and some Gucci-knockoff sandals I bought in the Village . She is always tiny . Her hair is always straight and thin ; she always seems to be inhaling and never exhaling . She is always wearing expensive khaki pants , Chanelballet flats , a French striped Tshirt , and a white cardigan . Possibly some discreet pearls . In seven years and umpteen interviews the **60;121;TOOLONG outfit never changes . And it is simply impossible to imagine her doing anything so undignified as what was required to get her pregnant in the first place . Her eyes go directly to the splot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened my mouth and already I 'm behind . She ushers me into the front hall , an open space with a gleaming marble floor and mushroom-gray walls . In the middle is a round table with a vase of flowers that look as if they might die , but never dare wilt . This is my first impression of the Apartment and it strikes me like a hotel suite -- immaculate , but impersonal . Even the lone finger painting I will later find taped to the fridge looks as if it were ordered from a catalog . ( Sub-Zeros with a custom-colored panel are n't magnetized . ) She offers to take my cardigan , stares disdainfully at the hair my cat seems to have rubbed on it for good luck , and offers me a drink . I 'm supposed to say , " Water would be lovely , " but am often tempted to ask for a Scotch , just to see what she 'd do . I am then invited into the living room , which varies from baronial splendor to Ethan Allen interchangeable , depending on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the couch , where I promptly sink three feet into the cushions , transformed into a five-year-old dwarfed by mountains of chintz . She looms above me , ramrod straight in a very uncomfortable-looking chair , legs crossed , tight smile . Now we begin the actual Interview . I awkwardly place my sweating glass of water carefully on a coaster that looks as if it could use a coaster . She is clearly reeling with pleasure at my sheer Caucasianness . " So , " she begins brightly , " how did you come to the Parents League ? " This is the only part of the Interview that resembles a professional exchange . We will dance around certain words , such as " nanny " and " child care , " because they would be distasteful and we will never , ever , actually acknowledge that we are talking about my working for her . This is the Holy Covenant of the Mother/Nanny relationship : this is a pleasure -- not a job . We are merely " getting to know each other , " much as how I imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while trying not to kill the mood . The closest we get to the possibility that I might actually be doing this for money is the topic of my baby-sitting experience , which I describe as a passionate hobby , much like raising Seeing Eye dogs for the blind . As the conversation progresses I become a child-development expert -- convincing both of us of my desire to fulfill my very soul by raising a child and taking part in all stages of his/her development ; a simple trip to the park or museum becoming a precious journey of the heart . I cite amusing anecdotes from past gigs , referring to the children by name --  " I still marvel at the cognitive growth of Constance with each hour we spent together in the sandbox . " I feel my eyes twinkle and imagine twirling my umbrella a la Mary Poppins . We both sit in silence for a moment picturing my studio apartment crowded with framed finger paintings and my doctorates from Stanford . She stares at me expectantly , ready for me to bring it on home . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peanut butter sandwiches and peanut butter in my hair and Elmo -- I love Elmo and sand in my purse and the " Hokey Pokey " ca n't get enough of it !  - -  and soy milk and blankies and the endless barrage of questions no one knows the answers to , I mean why is the sky blue ? And Disney ! Disney is my second language ! " We can both hear " A Whole New World " slowly swelling in the background as I earnestly convey that it would be more than a privilege to take care of her child -- it would be an adventure . She is flushed , but still playing it close to the chest . Now she wants to know why , if I 'm so fabulous , I would want to take care of her child . I mean , she gave birth to it and she does n't want to do it , so why would I ? Am I trying to pay off an abortion ? Fund a leftist group ? How did she get this lucky ? She wants to know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what I think of private schools in Manhattan , what my parents do . I answer with as much filigree and insouciance as I can muster , trying to slightly cock my head like Snow White listening to the animals . She , in turn , is aiming for more of a Diane-Sawyer-pose , looking for answers which will confirm that I am not there to steal her husband , jewelry , friends , or child . In that order . Nanny Fact : in every one of my interviews , references are never checked . I am white . I speak French . My parents are college educated . I have no visible piercings and have been to Lincoln Center in the last two months . I 'm hired .
