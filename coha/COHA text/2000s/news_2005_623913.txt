<p> There are strange and stringent demands in the world of television , and when they are not met  --  utter weirdness and bedlam . <p> Viewers have demands they enforce both knowingly and unknowingly . Expecting something more or different from Martha Stewart  --  and not getting it  --  the viewers revolt and stay away . Excitedly anticipating a remake worthy of the original " Night Stalker "  --  and not getting it  --  the buzz dies and the series is killed . Aggrieved and annoyed fans feel hurt and angry that the rest of the country does n't view " Arrested Development " the way they do  --  and a network ultimately rises up and speaks for the masses and the bottom line . <p> Nobody cared that " Joey " was spun off one of the most successful sitcoms of all time . Networks can create as many can't-fail star vehicles as they wish  --  but the audience will always decide . That never changes . <p> What then to make of all this talk , bubbling up through at least a portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television 's most acclaimed series  --  " Desperate Housewives " on ABC and " Curb Your Enthusiasm " on HBO  --  have taken turns for the worse ? <p> Partially right , mostly wrong , for very different reasons . <p> Let 's start with the show 26 million people watch every Sunday , the second most popular show on television , " Desperate Housewives . " Has it faltered ? You bet it has . But in ways not necessarily as dire as presented at the water cooler . <p> It 's true that one of the main weaknesses of " Desperate Housewives " is that the stars are assembled into so meagerly coherent a story line . At times the series has played out as a less-than-intricate collection of short stories , rather than a novel everyone seems to crave . The writing has not been as crisp  --  also true  --  and when executive producer , creator and writer Marc Cherry came to the defense of his writers earlier this season , saying , in effect , that even though he had n't written any scripts , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episode , it was either an overly kind act of parental protection or proof that the series was well off course . <p> What 's more accurate is this : The recipe that " Desperate Housewives " used in its freshman season to completely and stunningly entrap a nation was a souffle of intricate proportions  --  one inelegantly recooked this season . By contrast , a cop show is mere spaghetti . It takes real effort to mess it up . <p> " Desperate Housewives " is a hyper-real kind of nighttime soap opera , a brightly lit , broadly played allegory of suburban life . One false move and it becomes a spoof , a minor variation over there and it becomes schmaltz . What the country embraced last year was a season of creative plate spinning that was not only ridiculously successful , but also nearly felled Cherry . Literally sick from overwork , he vowed to take it easier this year . <p> You can make the argument that his leaving the writing to others has produced a  --  if not tone-deaf , then toneless  --  reproduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the immensely talented Cherry had written every word , " Desperate Housewives " would still have stumbled creatively . It was inevitable . <p> Though most critics were n't as easily smitten as viewers during the first season , there 's no denying that the women of Wisteria Lane were intoxicating  --  a result of dramatic flash , fiercely written dialogue and wonderful dramatic acting . Everybody 's story , even those of the minor characters , was interesting . And it did n't hurt that the pilot featured the suicide of the narrator , leading to a seasonlong story arc that addressed why she killed herself and in the process unraveled many mysteries . <p> This season ? We already know why Mary Alice shot herself . With the damage done , her family  --  husband , alleged son  --  has proved less than intriguing . The romances on the street are either tired ( Susan and Mike ) , boring ( Lynette and Tom ) , pointless ( Gabrielle and Carlos ) or stupid ( Edie and Karl ) . Only Bree 's weird dalliance with creepy pharmacist-killer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when George used that psycho smile for the 100th time . <p> The arrival of Betty and son Matthew  --  with crazy Caleb in the basement  --  has been nothing if not insipid . And " Desperate Housewives " outed itself at the Emmys by opting to be in the comedy category . There has been precious little humor in this series and , at least this season , none of it very evident or worth the investment in the absurd premises the writers demand for each punch line . Face it , this is a drama , and this season " Desperate Housewives " has been dramatically worse than last season . <p> But wait  --  this is n't scorn or piling on . It 's a reaffirmation of two things : ( 1 ) that last year 's show was sublimely rare , a longshot fan favorite with a big kick down the stretch , and ( 2 ) it 's nearly impossible to do that twice . <p> It could be that " Desperate Housewives " will never be as good as the first season and , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood , it really was n't that great in the first place . But Cherry is very talented and he should not be counted out . " Desperate Housewives " is a tough creative balancing act , and though it has stumbled this year , it wo n't completely topple in coming seasons . Look for a return to balance , if not form . <p> In comparison , " Curb Your Enthusiasm " has proved its brilliance episode after episode , season after season . That 's four , if you 're counting . Some seasons have been better than others , some individual episodes vastly superior to others . Now in its fifth season , " Curb " is no different . It did n't help that the first episode was flat and that the misses have been more glaring ( maybe because the hits were so hilariously obvious ? ) . But it 's far too early and certainly ill-advised to suggest that " Curb " has gone downhill . Sideways , maybe . But when the season ends , a true evaluation will most likely reveal that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewers are griping about probably stems from overfamiliarity and predictability . Look , as dipped in genius as this series has been , the premise is not too difficult : Larry David , like Curious George before him , gets into a lot of trouble . Mostly , it 's wince-inducing trouble . It 's a torturous kind of humor for the viewer , where you find yourself recoiling into the couch to escape Larry 's awkward social situations , the unfiltered passageway between his brain and his mouth . <p> Creating that conflict is , well , labor intensive . When " Curb " is painfully brilliant it 's because separate comedic themes all come together seamlessly by the end of the half hour . Larry 's antics cause a ripple effect that grows more hilarious as the episode goes on , and viewers appreciate the contortions Larry and friends have gone through  --  ridiculous as they may be  --  to ensure our belly laugh . At it 's best , " Curb " is audacious and childish at the same time . <p> Only now , perhaps , five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much labor goes into the delivery . We are familiar with it . When Larry gets a sandwich named after him , you immediately know it wo n't be good enough . In " The Christ Nail , " if you did n't see the punch line(s) coming , then you 've never watched the show closely enough . " Kamikaze Bingo " ? An implosion of good intent . " Lewis Needs a Kidney " ? Much , much better . <p> This is probably how " Curb Your Enthusiasm " will play out its season . Wonderfully inspired highs and lows that bemoan ( and betray ) our unfettered loyalty . The obstacle in the series is that sometimes we know that Larry ca n't be that clueless , that uninterested in others , that prone to embarrassing situations . <p> Now , when he gets into those situations , ever more elaborately , we 're not that impressed . Five seasons on , we can count off the beat , the pause and sometimes even the punch line . Does this make it less funny ? Sometimes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting what they 've always got from " Curb Your Enthusiasm "  --  a jolt to the side , a reaffirmation that mean-spiritedness is not only wholly inappropriate but also wildly funny . <p> The difference this year is we 're less startled by Larry 's antics . But as long as he delivers a laugh more often than not , what 's the crime in seeing them coming ? That 's not failure  --  it 's familiarity . And certainly no reason for David or HBO to get all desperate on us.
