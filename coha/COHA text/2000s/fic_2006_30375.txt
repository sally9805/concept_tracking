Chapter One DOUBLE DECAP YOU KNOW ME-I 'm a family man . Very much a family man . Give me a family to behead and I 'm as happy as the next guy . " Burt Lancaster gets a lot of laughs for this . He looks confident , and I know he 's probably spent hours in the mirror rehearsing this routine . I have to admit , his timing is perfect , his delivery excellent , and he 's playing us like a comedian would play an audience . It 's going to be another in a long line of fun Club nights . " I broke into this house and realized immediately that the husband was a DIY nut . There was barely a thing he had n't built himself . Even the stove had that ' Made by a Moron ' look . " Burt is in top form . William Holden is sitting to my right . He offers me a cigarette , and I accept , lighting it with my silver-plated lighter . I smoke only at meetings , and this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all serial killers-or skillers , as they like to call themselves-smoke . Do n't ask me why , they just do . " So I 'm thinking , What would be a good way to behead a DIY nut ? " Burt is drawing us in , teasing us . Chuck Norris calls out : " Get him to build you a guillotine ! " Everyone laughs at this . We all love Chuck , and if given the chance to be anyone for a day , I think we 'd all choose Chuck Norris . Burt lets the joke settle , nods approvingly , and then draws us in , making us hang on his every word . " I decide to fetch his Black and Decker Workmate from the garage . But then I catch sight of something hanging above it on the wall . It 's this really well-looked-after saw ... a real polished beauty-and I just know I have to use this ... well , this really great tool , this truly cool tool . " I glance at William Holden , who is sitting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more novels ? " William frowns , looks down his nose at me . " I do n't write novels . They 're factually based works . " I know this , but I just want to tease William a little . He 's given the same answer a million times over to the exact same question , but it 's fun and we enjoy the buddy-buddy repartee of it . Sometimes I ask him twice if I get drunk later on . " I bought your other two novels . They 're a terrific read . " Someone shushes me , I think it 's Cher , and I hold up my hand , gesture an apology , and go back to listening to Burt 's star turn . " So there I am , his prize saw in one hand and his prize head in the other . I 'm staring at his white-as-a-sheet wife , and all I can think to say is : ' Try going to department stores . You 'll find everything you need there . ' " The Club erupts , and Burt laughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , and as Burt takes a seat to a well-deserved round of applause , William edges closer to me . His voice is never more than a throaty whisper , and I have to listen hard to take in what he is saying . " As it happens , I 've got this great idea for a novel , " he whispers , getting into his stride . " Wow . " I pretend to be impressed . " What 's it about ? " " It 's semiautobiographical . About my childhood . Well ... it 's really about my mother . " " You have a title yet ? " I already can guess the title . My Bastard Mommy . In huge bloodred letters . They always blame their moms-always . " Got a few ideas , but nothing firm . Though I want to keep it nice and simple . Something like Where Was the Love , Bitch ? " " Great title . " " You think ? " " If I saw that in a bookstore , I 'd snap it right up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Mason breathe in the plume and then immediately reach for his extra-nicotine nonfilter cigarettes . William is very keen to tell me a story I 've already heard a hundred times before . I half wish I 'd sat somewhere else , but it 's all part of the great vibe , and I let William 's words wash over me like a cup of warm milk . " It started on bath nights . I was about eight . Mom was pretty spiritual and saw the bath as a mini river Jordan . Held me under every night till I was purified . I spent my entire childhood waterlogged . " The talk of water sends me hurrying to the washroom in less than five minutes . I find I am still giggling at Burt 's hilarious story when I notice a guy looking at me as if he ca n't figure out what is so funny about urination . He 's tall , handsome , immaculately turned out , and pretty much all-American . I try to explain . " Just heard the funniest story ever . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look deep into me for a second , as if looking for something , like a computer doing a search on its hard drive . I feel a little uneasy , quickly break his look , and pretend to giggle again . " I 've got stomach cramps from laughing so much . " The all-American leaves , but on the way past me he does the weirdest thing . He puts a hand on my shoulder and squeezes it . " Nice to meet you , " is all he whispers . Then he is gone , leaving me feeling invaded . Men just do n't do that to other men-touch them while they 're taking a leak , I mean . That is breaking a taboo that has held since the dawn of civilization . I 'm sure even cavemen knew not to touch each other during a piss . I zip up but ca n't shake the imprint of the all-American 's touch on my shoulder . It 's almost as if he 's still squeezing it . Tony Curtis bursts in , belching and laughing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , can he tell a story . Never knew decapitation could sound so funny . " I try to get back on track . " I agree totally . It was , uh ... it was incredible . " " He could bring on appendicitis , he 's so funny .... " Tony proceeds to have the longest , hardest piss in history , and while he does he glances over to me . " That Burt 's an A-OK guy . " I look at Tony , and for a moment I feel like we 're the oldest of buddies , and I smile . " Absolutely . Double A-OK . He should get his own TV show . " I laugh as I fill the sink . I make a point of scrubbing my hands thoroughly , because Tony has killed people on account of their lack of cleanliness and good manners . Cleverly ignoring the fact that he ca n't talk without belching in your face . " The Decap Show , " Tony belches out , then leaves . Without washing his hands .
