Florists pick the best 38 garden roses for cutting Photograph LEFT : Roses from Jacob Maarse 's home garden are arranged in bouquets that include ' Olympiad ' ( red ) , ' Double Delight ' ( cream with pink edges ) , Bride 's Dream ' ( pale pink ) , Yves Piaget ' ( mauve-grape ) , and Dolly Pan.on ' ( orange ) . RIGHT : Jan Weverka combines old roses like creamy ' Sombreuil ' and modern hybrids such as ' Fragrant Plum ' with garden companions like columbine , feverfew , and valerian. // Any rose that has a strong stem and lasts at least three days in a vase is a good rose for cutting . That 's the opinion of Jacob Maarse , founder of Jacob Maarse Florists in Pasadena and Los Angeles , and Jan Weverka , owner of Roses by Jan in Monrovia , California . Both grow roses in their home gardens to sell at their respective businesses . Notice they recommend strong-not longstems . Weak-stemmed roses are difficult to use in arrangements , says Maarse , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shorter vase , " Maarse says . If stems are very short , create the closely packed , dome-shaped , ultraromantic arrangement Europeans call a pave . ( Place a presoaked foam block in a shallow bowl and stud the block with roses , placing them as closely as tiles in a mosaic . ) Or use shorter-stemmed roses near the bottom of bouquets , the way Weverka does . " Choose roses that are at least half open , " she suggests . " Their weight will add ballast to the arrangement . " What else makes a rose good for cutting ? Shapely blooms . Though most of us think of a cut rose as a single flower on the end of a stem , roses that flower in clusters , like floribundas and some climbing roses , look great in vases . One stem can be a bouquet in itself . A tip : Pinch off the central flower bud ( terminal bud ) in the cluster , so all the remaining buds will open at the same time . About that three-day rule : If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least a week , you 'll miss out on some of the most fragrant roses in the world , including the big blowsy VictoriansBourbons , Portlands , and hybrid perpetuals . ( As a rule , the more fragrant the rose , the shorter its vase life . ) And you ca n't cut the densely petaled David Austin roses in bud stage and watch them open in the vase the way you can a hybrid tea ; David Austins will refuse to unfurl . Let them unfold three-quarters of the way on the shrub , then cut them and watch the rest of the show indoors . To find the best garden roses for cutting , we talked with dozens of florists .

Weverka also publishes an organic rose gardening newsletter , The Rose Garden ( call 626/301-0013 for a sample ) . Photograph // Weverka follows the classic triangle style in her arrangements . " But because I use old garden roses and simple companions , like feverfew , they look softer and more casual . " Jacob Maarse , shown below in his home garden in Sierra Madre , California , has operated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( His son Hank is now a co-owner . ) Maarse 's garden doubles as a flower farm . It contains more than 2,500 rose bushes that provide blooms for the shop . " Garden roses are always prettier than florist roses , " he says . " They 're more graceful . " " Simple but luxurious , " is how he describes the Maarse style . " Most people try too hard , " he says . " There 's nothing wrong with a vase full of nothing but roses-as long as they 're great roses and you use them generously . " Cutting tips from the pros Pick roses early in the morning or early in the evening , when sugar and hydration levels are both high . The flowers will last longer . Cut roses just above the third five-part leaf , counting down from the flower . You 'll have longer stems and encourage stronger growth from the next crop . Recut all stems underwater before adding to bouquets . This keeps stems open so they can take up water . Acidify vase water . Add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soda , like 7-Up , with three parts water . Or simply add a few drops of household bleach per gallon of water , as Weverka does . Remove all foliage that 's beneath the vase water . Submerged leaves will rot quickly and shorten the life of your bouquet . <p>
