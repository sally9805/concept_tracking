<p> Valle de Las Lenas , Argentina <p> Charles Darwin , who traipsed through South America in the mid-1800s , was nonplussed with the barren stretch of Andes Mountains in southern Argentina , preferring the range 's more diverse offerings in Chile . <p> Obviously , Charlie did n't ski . <p> For ensconced in the serrated , bleak Andes in southern Argentina is a ski experience like no other . In the Valle de Las Lenas is a resort that combines the steeps of Jackson Hole , the snowy aprons of Europe and the vistas of Colorado 's fourteeners . All from a single mountaintop lift that accesses more than half a million acres of off-piste skiing . <p> When the summer broils in Colorado , winter scours the southern Andes , the world 's youngest mountain range . Ski-hardened gringos from the north , jonesing for a summertime ski fix , flock to the resort every season , enduring cultural and climatological shock to ride what is renowned as some of the most rowdy lift-access skiing in the world . <p> They mingle uneasily with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22-year-old resort a distinctly upscale flair and fuel a late-night party scene that easily bests Aspen and gives New Orleans a run for the money . <p> Known as the most expensive locale in Argentina , Las Lenas runs about one-half of what you might spend on a typical Western ski vacation . It 's especially affordable con- <p> sidering Argentina 's economy is in the tank . Lift tickets are $ 30 a day . Dinners at the area 's array of eateries , from steakhouses to cafeterias , cost $ 3 to $ 15 , including locally produced wine . Resort lodging runs as little as $ 10 a night for a dormitory room to $ 100 for a five-star hotel or large apartment . Most hotels only book by the week , and the resort quickly fills in September . <p> The overall flavor of Las Lenas is industrial . Concrete buildings , reminiscent of the utilitarian Cliff Lodge at Utah 's Snowbird ski area , litter the base area . Like stone lean-tos , the resort 's 11 lodges are braced for an avalanche assault , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the village . <p> Avalanches have wreaked as much havoc as they can in Las Lenas , tearing down lifts , eliminating lodges and burying entire buildings . Concrete walls , angled to repel a snowy attack , guard lift towers . Giant mounds of dirt , dredged from trenches scarring the area 's hillsides , are arranged to weaken avalanches before they hit the valley floor . Strategically wedged into the area 's looming peaks are huge pipes , which spew explosions of natural gas whenever temperature , snow and wind conspire in avalanche-building whispers . <p> Las Lenas is like a ski-resort factory , with man creating anything and everything to help battle the ruthless power of Andean snow . It is a vain , futile fight . <p> When the snow comes , it comes hard and heavy . It 's followed by the wind , which can lovingly remold every ski line into a fresh powder field but also tends to create avalanche terrain weeks after a snowfall . <p> Go in August , September <p> The best time to visit Las Lenas is in the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warm weather softens and solidifies the snow , and the annual springtime dump , the perennial Santa Rosa , usually assures a bountiful harvest of corn snow . <p> For the not-quite-expert skier , there 's plenty of challenging terrain . Seven double chairs and four surface lifts access 35 miles of trails , some winding for as long as 5 miles . Ski teams from around the globe rally in Las Lenas every spring to get a jump-start on the racing season , scratching turns on the mountain 's flanks . <p> For the expert skier , there is too much challenging terrain . It would take more than a dozen 100-day seasons to even begin to grasp the potential that spills from the mountaintop Marte lift at Las Lenas . <p> ' Stack up four of your favorite , steepest lines in Colorado - and wipe away the bumps - and you are starting to get an idea , ' says Scott Gates , a ski guide from Irwin Lodge outside Crested Butte . <p> The highest lift , the fabled Marte , climbs 2,578 vertical feet at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while standing atop a 4,000 vertical-foot , 50-degree flume of snow is eclipsed if you ever find yourself swinging on the Marte when it 's been shuttered by gusting , icy wind . It 's a ride like no other . <p> But the rewards are exponential . Las Lenas boasts the most verticality of any mountain in South America or the U.S. Take a hike off the top of the Marte , and the potential for skiing increases with each step . <p> ' From the top there are so many possibilities . I think it 's impossible to find a mountain similar to this anywhere in the world . Believe me , I 've been looking , ' says Swiss-born Thomas Perren , who has spent every winter in Las Lenas for the past 15 years and penned the mountain 's only guidebook . ' Without hiking , there are so many possibilities . But with a little more hiking , the possibilities become almost infinite .

Those shells inspired Darwin to correctly assume in 1835 that the Andes were not long ago on the ocean floor . <p> Fossil hunting provides an easy distraction during the search for the myriad gravity-filled thrills that pour from the top of the Marte lift . <p> In the spring , Las Lenas provides some of the most affordable helicopter skiing in the world . Four days , with four guaranteed runs each day , cost $ 1,200 per skier , or $ 300 a day . That 's less than most Sno-Cat outfits in the United States . Even though the choppers resemble the birds of ' MASH , ' they deliver thousands of feet of vertiginous virgin snow . For the more budget minded , a $ 15 daily Sno-Cat hauls skiers up to the runs off the Cerro Collar , where a lift once reached before it repeatedly was beaten back by avalanches . <p> While skiing is Las Lenas ' greatest asset , it hardly is the only activity . A dozen restaurants offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reservations , though ; most restaurants do n't open until 10 p.m . A casino in the tony Hotel Piscis allows visitors to test their luck on a collection of tables and machines . A pair of rowdy discothques , which usually get thumping about 2 a.m. , give visitors a chance to dance their legs into ski shape . The fairer of the Buenos Aires discothquers deliver some of the best eye candy in the Western Hemisphere . <p> Down the road in Los Molles - note that Argentinians pronounce the double ' ll ' as a ' j ' - is a nice hot springs , which costs about $ 6 . Turn left before the official springs , though , and find the ruins of an abandoned hot springs complex that was a top-notch draw in the 1950s before , not surprisingly , it was decimated by an avalanche . A couple candles make the ancient thermal pools more enticing than the official springs . <p> Elements test tenacity <p> Also on the road between Los Molles and Las Lenas is El Pozo de las Animas .

Local legend holds that some of Argentina 's most ruthless dictators disposed of dissidents with a quick shove into the rubble-lined holes , which offer no chance of escape . <p> The winds that frequent the valley create an eerie howl when flushing through the deep cavities , lending credence to the legacy that the holes are watery graves . <p> The vineyards of Argentina 's Mendoza province are within a few hours of Las Lenas . Many tour outfitters offer daily excursions from the resort to a handful of the lush wineries . <p> Getting to Las Lenas is no simple task ( see The Details ) . But however you get here , it takes at least a couple days from Colorado . Then there 's the temperamental Andean weather , which can quickly turn Las Lenas into an ice cube or wind tunnel .
