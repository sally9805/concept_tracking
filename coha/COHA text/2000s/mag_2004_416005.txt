One , two , three , Lisa counted on the calendar . Three weeks until Christmas . But Lisa did not have any money in her bank . Now how am I going to buy Christmas presents for everyone ? Lisa wondered . I 'd better earn some money fast . Lisa was on her way out to look for a way to earn money when Mrs. Lamb called . She was Lisa 's favorite neighbor and lived down the street . She was elderly , with white hair and old pointy glasses . Now that Lisa was a big ten-year-old , she was actually taller than Mrs. Lamb . Mrs. Lamb was not able to get around much anymore , so she often called Lisa to help her . However , since Mrs. Lamb was elderly and had always been so kind , Mom and Dad never ever allowed Lisa to accept money from her . So , when Mrs. Lamb called , Lisa ran down to her house . She figured she could finish the job in a jiffy and then look for odd jobs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mrs. Lamb as she opened the door . " I was wondering if you could do me a favor . Cagney needs to go for a walk . I feel bad not taking her myself , but I can barely get around without my walker as it is . My back has been hurting me lately . Would you mind taking care of her for the next few weeks ? She 'll need to be fed , walked , and let out every day . " " Sure , Mrs. Lamb , " said Lisa as she reached for Cagney 's leash . " That wo n't be a problem . " She was out the door in a flash with Cagney , Mrs. Lamb 's buffcolored cocker spaniel . This is going to take up a lot of time , Lisa thought to herself . But I 've still got to squeeze in time to earn money . Every day that week , both before and after school , Lisa took care of Cagney . What she had not realized was how much time it actually took to care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets better soon , thought Lisa . // When she woke up on Saturday , everything was covered with snow . Great ! Lisa thought . I can earn lots of money today helping Louie shovel snow ! But before she know it , Mrs. Lamb called Lisa to shovel around her house . Mrs. Lamb had a lot to shovel : a big driveway , a front walk , a back walk , even a porch . By the time Lisa was done , there was no shoveling left for her to do around the neighborhood . " This is not good , " Lisa moaned as she collapsed on the couch . She was exhausted from all the hard work . // On Sunday , Lisa went down to Mrs. Lamb 's house as usual . Cagney greeted her as she opened the door , and Mrs. Lamb called to her from the living room . When Lisa entered the living room , she found Mrs. Lamb in her special chair as usual , but was shocked by what she saw . Spread all around Mrs. Lamb , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feet , were mounds and mounds of white yam . " You look like you 're surrounded by snow Did I shovel in the wrong direction ? " Lisa asked with a giggle . Mrs. Lamb laughed , too . " No , no , dear , " she said . " Fm just starting the next project . " And she continued to crochet the snowy , white yarn . Monday through Friday were the same as the week before : Cagney , school , Cagney , dinner , homework , Cagney , bed . // OK , Lisa thought to herself . On Saturday I have got to find some work . This is the last weekend before Christmas . If I do n't find work now , I 'll be in big trouble ! When Saturday came , Mrs. Lamb had another job for Lisa . " Lisa , dear , would you mind going to the craft store on the corner for me ? I have a few things I need you to buy . " Lisa would never say no to Mrs. Lamb . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list and headed toward the store . At the store , Lisa walked up and down the aisles . She just had to buy some ribbon and tissue paper , but it was so much harder than she expected . What kind did Mrs. Lamb want ? What colors did she like ? And for Pete 's sake , which matched what ? After what seemed like forever , Lisa finally decided on white tissue paper with a design of green wreaths with red bows on it . Then she chose crinkly , red ribbon to bring out the red bows in the paper . Mrs. Lamb was waiting by the door when Lisa came back . " Oh , they are lovely , " Mrs. Lamb exclaimed as she took the wrappings out of the bag . " Well , Lisa , thank you for going to the store . You should come here bright and early tomorrow . We have a lot more work to do . " Lisa did not know what to say . Tomorrow would be the last day that she could earn money for Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , she would not be able to buy gifts for anyone . " Uh , Mrs. Lamb , " Lisa began . She did not want to hurt her feelings , but she had to say something . " I was planning on using tomorrow to earn some money for Christmas presents . " " You do n't need money , dear . We 've already bought everything we need , " Mrs. Lamb replied . Confused , Lisa asked , " Everything we need ? " " Well , of course , dear , these presents are from both of us , " Mrs. Lamb explained . " You see , if you had n't shoveled snow for me , I would 've had to pay someone else to do it . Then I would n't have had any money to buy yarn , tissue paper , and ribbon . " By taking care of Cagney , you allowed me the time to crochet the angels . You picked out those pretty wrappings all by yourself . And tomorrow you will help me finish making the angels into ornaments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we receive without even realizing it . " The next day , Lisa and Mrs. Lamb finished their gifts together . They mixed some starch with warm water . Mrs. Lamb took one of the angels and dipped it completely in the starch . Then she set it aside to dry . Lisa picked up the next angel and did the same thing . When all the angels were dry , Mrs. Lamb and Lisa wrapped them in tissue paper and tied them with red ribbon . // As they wrapped the last ones , Lisa asked Mrs. Lamb , " How did you know how to make these ? " " I learned this many years ago when I was someone 's Christmas Angel , " she said . " Now I 'm passing it down to you . You 're my Christmas Angel . " <p>
