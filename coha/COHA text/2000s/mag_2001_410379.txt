<p> AFTER DECADES OF NOISY PROTESTS AND VIOLENCE , ANTI-ABORTION ACTIVISTS ARE RELYING ON A NEW " STEALTH STRATEGY " TO SHUT DOWN CLINICS . <p> It was counseling day last spring at the Hope Medical Group for Women , a small brick abortion clinic tucked discreetly along a street of upscale shops in Shreveport , Louisiana . In the waiting room , pregnant women paged through magazines . At the front desk , a receptionist monitored the clinic s perimeter on an overhead screen and buzzed in patients through a locked door , alert for signs of trouble from anti-abortion activists . Robin Rothrock , the clinic administrator , was preparing for the day 's appointments when the telephone rang . <p> The caller , a pro-choice attorney who represented the clinic , had some disturbing news : The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had thrown out a lawsuit filed by Rothrock and four other providers that challenged Louisiana 's newest anti-abortion law , a measure so sweeping it could instantly shut down every clinic in the state . The " civil-liability law , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had the procedure to sue the doctor for up to 10 years  --  not just for her own injuries , but also for " damages occasioned by the unborn child . " With no limit to the amount doctors could be ordered to pay , one big judgment in favor of a woman who regretted her abortion could drive a clinic out of business . <p> Earlier , a lower federal court had found the law unconstitutional , saying it would limit women 's access to abortions by discouraging doctors from providing them . But the appellate judges reversed the decision , ruling that providers could not sue the state over the issue in federal court . <p> " What ? " Rothrock asked the caller , hardly believing the news . She had assumed the judges would find the law so absurd that it would die quietly in the courts . When she learned it had been resurrected , all she could think of were horror films . " It was like a really scary movie , when you think the bad guy is dead , and suddenly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's no way a physician can perform an abortion with this law on the books . It 's an insane level of exposure . " <p> While the ruling panicked pro-choice advocates like Rothrock , it received little attention in the media beyond a brief news clip on page 7B of the Baton Rouge Advocate . And that 's just how abortion foes want it . For years , the anti-abortion movement has pressed its case with noisy demonstrations that blocked clinics , with high-profile legislation that directly challenged the U.S. Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade , and in some cases with violence , including the assassination of physicians . But 28 years after Roe , with public support of abortion rights running high , the movement has adopted what might be called a stealth strategy : to chip away at abortion rights , slowly and discreetly , with low-profile legislation and lawsuits that stop short of trying to outlaw the procedure . <p> The new tactic is to bombard providers with a barrage of costly rules . In addition to the civil-liability law , Louisiana has tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything from the width of hallways in clinics to the angles and jet types for drinking fountains . Abortion opponents want to create small , expensive obstacles that cumulatively make it harder for clinics to offer services  --  or , in the words of one right-to-life leader , to create an environment " where abortion may indeed be perfectly legal , but no one can get one . " Not only does the tactic have the benefit of generating little public attention , but it also allows anti-abortion activists to couch the issue in terms of a woman 's welfare  --  for example , the right of a patient to sue her physician for unlimited sums . <p> " This is certainly one campaign that 's gaining increasing popularity as a way to hammer at abortion providers : to do it under the guise of caring about women 's health , " says Linda Rosenthal , a staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy in New York . " That 's a pretty palatable starting point . Of course , everybody cares about women 's health . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stealth strategy is being deployed nationwide , from Utah to Connecticut . But it 's Louisiana that serves as the incubator for the rest of the nation , the state where anti-abortion activists develop innovative measures to test on a state legislature where Catholics and Southern Baptists predominate . " Louisiana really seems to be leading the way in devising new and particularly burdensome regulations for abortion providers , " says Stephanie Mueller , director of public policy for the National Abortion Federation , an organization of providers based in Washington , D.C. " We expect that if something were to pass there , other states would follow their lead . " <p> For Rothrock , whose facility serves women from a 200-mile radius throughout rural Louisiana , Arkansas , and Texas , the stealth campaign poses an alarming new threat to a clinic that has already endured chemical attacks and paramilitary-style protests . Unlike the more flamboyant attacks , this one actually has the potential to make abortion unavailable to thousands of women . " We 're an outpost under siege , " Rothrock says . " Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there 's the constant deluge of legislation . The most overwhelming part comes from the realization that you have the entire state government , with all its resources , having only one objective , and that is to shut you down . " <p> At 51 , Robin Rothrock is one of those people whose physical presence and sheer forthrightness allow her to commandeer whatever room she walks into . Tall and gap-toothed , with gray-flecked blond hair that cascades to her shoulders , she has a face that practically changes shape as the conversation turns from denouncing state legislators to describing her clients . Running an " outpost under siege " was not how she planned to spend her career . " I had no idea what I was getting into , " she admits . <p> As a young woman , Rothrock was living a relatively comfortable life in Cocoa Beach , Florida , working for a program that helped teens and young adults make the transition from welfare to work . She soon noticed a pattern among certain clients . " I was struck by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would wreck her opportunity to be self-sufficient , " she says . <p> At the same time , Rothrock was volunteering at a women 's clinic whose owner had grown up in Shreveport . The owner lobbied Rothrock to go there to open an abortion facility , explaining that women had no place to obtain the procedure in the 400-mile stretch from Dallas to Jackson , Mississippi . Intrigued by the prospect of bringing medical care to an underserved part of the South , Rothrock looked at the region 's demographics and learned that the area had a high concentration of poor and working-class women who did n't have the resources to fly to Dallas for a procedure . One evening , at a beachside bar in Florida , she watched the sunset and prayed , " If I am supposed to go to Shreveport , show me this is the right thing to do . " A few minutes later , while using the rest room , she noticed some graffiti that said , " If men got pregnant , abortion would be a sacrament . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a strange way of communicating , " she says . <p> So at 29 , Rothrock moved herself and her young son 1,000 miles to northwestern Louisiana , where she bought and renovated an anonymous-looking 50-year-old building down the street from a small Methodist college . On opening day in 1980 , the Hope Medical Group had six patients  --  and 1,000 protesters , including a state senator , who staged a mock baby funeral . It was the beginning of two decades of relentless opposition that occasionally spilled over into terror . In 1983 , a recently released psychiatric patient in a red jumpsuit attacked the clinic with a sledgehammer , shouting , " The Lord has sent me , and this building is coming down . " In 1992 , when a vomit-like odor permeated the clinic , the staff assumed someone had thrown a stink bomb . But when the smell worsened , Rothrock realized the clinic had been attacked with a toxic chemical . Someone had drilled a hole in the door and inserted butyric acid , which is easily absorbed through the skin and carries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a collapsed lung and had to be hospitalized . <p> In the following weeks , Rothrock pulled up carpets and cleaned the clinic , oblivious to the effect the chemical was having on her own health . " Three months later , I went to get my hair cut , and the hairdresser said , ' Where 's your hair ? What happened to it ? ' " Rothrock 's doctor ran tests , which revealed abnormal liver enzyme levels . <p> Despite the attacks , Rothrock remains unfazed . She has put down roots in Shreveport , where she has served as president of the state League of Women Voters . " Providing services in Louisiana is a natural place to be , " she says . " It 's like providing assistance in a Third World country because of the issues of poverty and inequality and race . The good thing is that you do n't have to worry about malaria and traveling with a passport . " <p> But in the past five years , Rothrock has faced a far bigger threat than the right-wing protesters she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women who could force her out of business do n't wear red jumpsuits and carry sledgehammers . Instead , they wear business suits and carry drafts of legislation . And they have counterparts in almost every state in the country . <p> The New Stealth strategy has its genesis in the 1992 U.S. Supreme Court decision Planned Parenthood v. Casey . The ruling reaffirmed 1973 's Roe v. Wade , signaling that overt bans on abortion were unlikely to pass constitutional muster . But it also declared for the first time that states have some authority to regulate abortion clinics , as long as they do n't place an " undue burden " on women " s access to abortions . <p> The Casey decision started abortion opponents rethinking their tactics . Since direct assaults on Roe would n't fly , " there had to be a shift in strategy by regulation on the outskirts of abortion , " says Dorinda Bordlee , staff counsel for Americans United for Life . That 's when leaders developed a new approach : Couch the issue in terms of women 's health . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such illnesses as depression and breast cancer , right-to-lifers realized they could subtly move the focus of the debate . " For 25 years , the prolife movement focused on the baby , and the abortion-rights movement focused on the woman , " says Bordlee . " The baby and the woman were pitted against each other . What we have realized is that the woman and the child have a sacred bond that should not be divided . What 's good for the child is good for the mother . So now we 're advocating legislation that is good for the woman . " <p> In reality , abortion is already one of the safest procedures a woman can have-less risky than taking penicillin , and much safer than having a baby . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) reports that only 3 women died from legal abortions in 1997 , compared to 327 who died from pregnancy complications . Adjusting for the higher number of pregnancies , it 's still 30 times more dangerous to try to carry a fetus to term . And for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast cancer , a study of 1.5 million women published in the New England Journal of Medicine failed to turn up such a correlation . <p> That has n't stopped conservative legislators from trying to make an issue of abortion safety . One of the most popular methods has been through laws that prochoice advocates call Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers ( TRAP ) . Pioneered in the mid-1990s by South Carolina and Mississippi , the laws apply licensing requirements specifically to abortion clinics , but not to other facilities that perform similar or riskier procedures . The laws vary from state to state , but often include building regulations that specify ceiling heights , hallway and doorway widths , counseling-room dimensions , air-circulation rates , outdoor weed-control practices , and separate changing rooms for men . Some require the purchase of expensive supplies not normally used in clinics , such as general anesthesia equipment . Others mandate staffing levels above those usually needed for first-trimester abortions . Missouri , for example , requires a registered nurse on staff when most clinics rely on less-expensive licensed practical nurses . <p> TRAP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insist they are simply trying to legislate good medical practice . " Look , I 'd love it if the Supreme Court would overturn Roe v. Wade , " says Mike Johnson , a Baton Rouge attorney who has helped draft Louisiana 's anti-abortion legislation . " That would be the greatest day of my life . But until we can do that , I accept the fact that they can perform abortions legally , and I just want them to do it under the same health and safety standards that any other medical professional has to adhere to . " <p> The problem , say opponents , is that the regulations go well beyond what other health care providers must follow , while doing little or nothing to improve the outcome of an already safe procedure . " I can say with confidence that these regulations will not have a single positive impact on women 's health , " says David Grimes , the former chief of the CDC branch that monitors abortion safety . " Having published on every hemorrhaged abortion death in the United States , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a door width . " Grimes calls TRAP laws the " antithesis " of good medical policy . " In public health , " he says , " we identify a problem , figure out the causes , look for solutions , and implement them . Here we see a vigorous response in the absence of a problem . It 's science run amok . It 's public health run backwards . " <p> The real motive for TRAP laws , say Grimes and others , is to force clinics to spend money on costly renovations for fear of being shut down by the state . This drives up the cost of abortions , placing them out of reach of some women . It could even force providers to shut down entirely . In 1999 , physician William Lynn shuttered his small clinic in Beaufort , South Carolina , saying he could not afford renovations to bring the historic building with narrow hallways into compliance with the state 's new clinic regulations . <p> TRAP laws are only one of the new tactics used by the anti-abortion movement . Montana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted only physicians to perform abortions . Touted as a safety measure , the law was actually targeted at physician 's assistant Susan Cahill , the only first-trimester abortion provider in the northwestern corner of the state . Although two respected studies have shown that physician 's assistants can perform abortions as safely as doctors , Cahill was forced to stop performing the procedure for 11 months until the law was overturned . <p> In fact , abortion opponents have found that the courts are as powerful a tool as the state legislatures . In the past few years , clinics and doctors have been hit with a spate of lawsuits claiming that women did n't give proper consent for an abortion or suffered psychological damage afterward . " A case will be brought against a provider that will most likely be thrown out , " says Mueller of the National Abortion Federation . " However , the physician still has to go through a lengthy court battle , and endure costs and publicity throughout the case . " Even the most far-fetched claims can hurt clinics . Anti-abortion lawyer John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Review suggesting that malpractice suits against abortion doctors " may serve an important role in raising public awareness " of the alleged abortion-breast cancer link . Kindley put that theory into practice in 1999 , suing a Fargo , North Dakota , clinic for disputing the breast-cancer theory in a brochure . Even before the case has gone to trial , the Red River Women 's Clinic has been forced to pay $5,000 in legal fees . " Part of their strategy is to drag this out as much as possible , " says clinic administrator Jane Bovard . " They do everything they can to make us incur more expenses . I think their goal is to nickel away at us , to make it too expensive to provide services . " <p> Louisiana 's latest round of legislation was triggered by a local television news series in 1999 alleging that the Delta Women 's Clinic in Baton Rouge was practicing bad medicine under unsanitary conditions . The reports used photographs that purported to show rusty instruments and drops of blood on the floor and tables . It was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state government were n't convinced the reports were accurate . " Were they rusty or did they not photograph well ? " says one high-ranking state employee familiar with the case . " That 's always been the question for us . " During an inspection of the clinic four months earlier , the state Department of Health and Hospitals ( DHH ) had found only minor violations . <p> But the dubiousness of the television series did n't stop state officials from pouncing . That February , Republican Governor Mike Foster declared a " public health emergency " and ordered the immediate inspection of abortion facilities without warrants or probable cause . " This situation can not be tolerated , " the governor declared . " We 're taking action now . " DHH reinspected the Delta clinic  --  and found only two minor problems , including a sticker that needed replacement on a dumpster . <p> Within two weeks of the order , Robin Rothrock and the state 's other abortion providers had filed suit to block the inspections . For Rothrock , it was a familiar scenario . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in challenging one anti-abortion action after another , in both the courts and the state legislature . Others she did n't even bother to fight , knowing there was no chance for defeat . In 1995 , for example , the legislature passed a measure requiring women to wait 24 hours between a state-scripted counseling session and the actual abortion procedure . " It 's very sneaky , because the public does n't really see what 's wrong with this law , " Rothrock says . But many women in outlying areas ca n't afford the extra travel or hotel costs  --  not to mention lost wages and childcare expenses  --  involved in a two-day trip to obtain an abortion . Samantha Evans , a receptionist at Rothrock 's clinic , remembers explaining the state-mandated waiting period to a woman planning to travel 100 miles from Tyler , Texas . " I ca n't do it , " the woman told Evans . " I 've got to come in one day . " She never called back . <p> This time around , a federal judge ruled in Rothrock 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency clinic inspections without the court 's approval . But by then , the right-to-life movement had sprung into action . Mike Johnson , the Baton Rouge lawyer , approached state Rep. Tony Perkins , who had helped pass the civil-liability law two years earlier . Using the allegations against Delta Women 's Clinic , he asked Perkins to introduce a TRAP scheme that would regulate abortion clinics much like ambulatory surgical centers , which perform much more invasive surgery . " You tell me what to do , and I 'll sponsor it , " Johnson recalls Perkins telling him . In the legislature , Perkins showed his colleagues a video of the TV reports on the Delta clinic . " That pretty much squelched any debate , " the Republican lawmaker says . <p> By early last year , the Department of Health and Hospitals had drafted a new set of regulations to implement the law . That 's when Rothrock realized how invasive the legislation would be . The proposed rules would have required Hope Medical Group to invest thousands of dollars in changes she considered medically unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , with its ceiling fans and herbal tea offerings , to be moved across a hallway and expanded to the size of a small apartment . They would have forced the clinic to build additional storage areas to keep patient records on the premises for 10 years . They would have demanded the hiring of a facility manager and a registered nurse , as well as the purchase of emergency equipment not generally needed for first-trimester abortions . The list continued for 18 pages . <p> The Foster administration insists it only wants to protect patients . " Our agenda is to assure health and safety to women who go to abortion facilities , " says DHH Secretary David Hood . " We 're not interested in putting them out of business . " But to pro-choice advocates , such concern sounded disingenuous coming from a government that prohibits most abortions at its highly regulated state-run hospitals . In one publicized case , the Louisiana State University Medical Center in Shreveport refused to terminate the pregnancy of a 27-year-old woman with a heart condition that could have killed her if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the capacity to help her , and she had to be transported 260 miles to a hospital in Houston . <p> Once again , Rothrock 's Hope Medical Group joined some of Louisiana 's other abortion providers in suing the state over the restrictive building codes . Last summer , a federal judge threw out the law over a technicality in how it was drafted . But if the ruling deflated abortion opponents , they were reinvigorated this year by a much more significant court decision . In February , the U.S. Supreme Court let stand South Carolina 's TRAP law , which imposes 27 pages of requirements on abortion clinics  --  providing a virtual blueprint for states that want to create constitutional clinic regulations . <p> " We took that as our cue that the state has the authority to draft regulations specifically for abortion providers , " says Johnson , the right-to-life attorney . The administration developed a new proposal , modeled partly on South Carolina 's law , which was then introduced quietly by a Democrat . This time around , " they did n't do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Russell Henderson , an abortion-rights lobbyist . " The main people testifying were Secretary Hood and his staff , saying , ' We just want to protect women . ' It was very much muted in contrast to two years ago . " The measure sailed through both chambers and was signed by the governor in June . <p> So now Rothrock is gearing up for another round of legal challenges to the new TRAP law . She 's not relishing the prospect . Trying to run a clinic while simultaneously battling the state government has exhausted her . " I do n't try to think about it too terribly much , because it can become overwhelming , " she says . " When we come up against something that seems insurmountable , I visualize myself climbing Mount Everest . I think of the immediate challenge facing us as a particularly treacherous and difficult face of the mountain that requires strategy , endurance , strength , and courage . " She thinks , too , of the hardship Louisianans would face if clinics like hers were forced out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their families depends on our ability to keep our doors open , " she says . " Unless individuals are willing to provide abortion care , all this talk about ' rights ' is just empty talk . " <p> Robin Rothrock ( left ) fought a new Louisiana anti-abortion law that would have required her clinic to buy unnecessary equipment and expand its recovery room ( below ) to the size of a small apartment . Rothrock asked that her face not be shown , out of fear for her safety . <p> Mike Johnson , a Baton Rouge attorney , has helped draft antiabortion laws that threaten to shut down clinics in Louisiana . <p> By Barry Yeoman <p> Photographs by Peter Ross <p>
