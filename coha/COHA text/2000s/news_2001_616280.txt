Here are explanations for many of the terms used to discuss salsa products . &gt; Capsicum ( KAP-si-kum )  --  chile genus ; any of the plants that produce chiles as their fruit ; the chile itself . &gt; Capsaicin ( kap-SAY-uh-sin )  --  an alkaloid produced by and contained in chiles that causes a burning sensation . &gt; Cilantro ( sill-AHN-tro )  --  the leaves of the herb coriander ; they are used extensively in Mexican cooking and are usually an ingredient in salsa .

Or brown unpeeled garlic cloves in a hot skillet before chopping and adding to salsa. &gt; Fresh , vine-ripened tomatoes make great salsas but are sometimes too watery to hold together as a chip dip . Just make the salsa as directed , pour off the watery liquid , and save for a future use  --  in soups , sauces or when boiling rice . &gt; For quick dessert salsas , follow the lead of pastry chef Kirk Parks of Nava . Add a little sugar to chunky fruit like peaches , along with a squeeze of lemon or lime and 2 capfuls of tequila . Toss in some dried cherries or blueberries for color and let stand 10 minutes .
