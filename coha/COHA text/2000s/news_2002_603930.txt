<p> Bernie Ebbers built a personal empire the way he built WorldCom : with bold deals , big gambles and costly mistakes . <p> Over 20 years , while Ebbers turned WorldCom into the USA 's No. 2 long-distance phone company , he also made a string of personal investments that engaged his passions . He bought Canada 's biggest ranch and stakes in two farms , a minor league hockey team , a trucking company , an all-terrain-vehicle dealership , a lumberyard , enough acres of timberland to cover half the state of Rhode Island and a yacht company . He also expanded his original hotel chain . <p> Ebbers viewed his outside ventures with pride . With childlike excitement , he once gathered top WorldCom officials in a conference room for a slide show of his ranch . He loved hanging around the shipyard and riding tractors on his farms . He spoke animatedly about his hockey team . He even made WorldCom executives sit through discussions of hotel occupancy rates . <p> Today , the former billionaire is in danger of losing many of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was ousted as CEO in April . WorldCom is negotiating with Ebbers to unload his ranch and his stakes in the timber properties and lumberyard , people close to the negotiations say , to cover $ 408 million in loans from the telecom giant . WorldCom has already claimed Ebbers ' yacht-building company . <p> WorldCom is unlikely to recover all of its loans , a USA TODAY investigation shows . Many of Ebbers ' private ventures have stumbled just like WorldCom . While Ebbers has said little publicly about his non-WorldCom ventures , what 's happened to them sheds light on the management style that also imperiled WorldCom and on one of the 1990s ' most influential business figures . <p> At his day job , Ebbers helped fuel the telecom boom of the 1990s . He built WorldCom into a titan and rose to No. 174 on Forbes ' list of richest Americans . It was 1999 , and he was worth an estimated $ 1.4 billion . <p> Likewise , life was good at Ebbers Inc . <p> " We have all the money in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a nearby Indian tribe after Ebbers bought the British Columbia ranch in 1998 . In Savannah , Ga. , Thomas Conboy , who got up to $ 25 million from Ebbers to turn a military mine-sweeping company , Intermarine , into a yacht builder , would refer to Ebbers as " the bank , " former employees say . <p> Now , Ebbers is best known for presiding over one of the biggest corporate meltdowns in history . <p> Less than three months after his ouster , WorldCom filed the biggest bankruptcy case ever and disclosed the first part of what would grow to a $ 9 billion accounting scandal . Its collapse has cost investors and creditors tens of billions of dollars . While investigators and attorneys for shareholders have yet to pinpoint Ebbers ' role , if any , in the accounting scandal , they are eyeing his personal ventures for wrongdoing and restitution . Ebbers could not be reached for this story . His lawyer declined to comment . <p> Mixing tactics , worlds <p> Ebbers mixed his two worlds often . A closer look at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his own money as with shareholders ' cash , including : <p> * Overpaying . Ebbers and WorldCom paid a premium for companies during the telecom boom . Now , WorldCom says it may have to take a charge of up to $ 50 billion in goodwill and other write-downs because those assets are worth much less . <p> Ebbers also made personal investments at high prices , only to see their values fall . <p> He reportedly paid nearly $ 65 million for the British Columbia ranch in 1998 . Rudy Nielsen , a Vancouver real estate broker at Niho Land and Cattle , estimated the ranch was worth $ 48 million to $ 54 million at the time . Nielsen has said Ebbers paid a large " trophy fee " to own it . The ranch will likely sell for far less because of extensive logging on the property , as well as depressed cattle and timber prices , Canadian real estate and timber experts say . Ranch manager Gardner referred questions to Ebbers . <p> The same year he bought the ranch , Ebbers paid $ 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it , former employees say . It now builds and repairs some of the biggest yachts in the world . Still , it is not expected to fetch more than $ 10 million when WorldCom accepts one of several pending bids , people involved in the negotiations say . <p> Another big Ebbers ' investment facing tough market conditions is Joshua Timberlands . In 1999 , the company spent $ 400 million to buy 460,000 acres in Mississippi , Alabama and Tennessee . Joshua also paid about $ 200 million for more than 80,000 acres in Louisiana , people familiar with the deal say . But prices of several key timber products in the Southeast have declined since then , says the University of Georgia 's Warnell School of Forest Resources . Also , timberland values in the region dropped 15% from 1999 through 2001 , says Hancock Timber Resource Group . <p> Still , without knowing what 's on Ebbers ' property and how he 's used it , it 's hard to put a price tag on it , says Tom Harris , a University of Georgia professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high-tech stock in 1999 and watching it disappear , timber has been relatively stable , " Harris says . <p> Meanwhile , Ebbers is no longer in the minor league hockey business . In September , he was forced to sell his stake in the Jackson Bandits just three years after he brought the sport to his home area of Jackson , Miss . While fans were enthusiastic , arena scheduling problems hurt attendance . Ebbers and his former partners tried to strike a deal for a new $ 25 million arena . That project is still pending . <p> Some of Ebbers ' other deals seemed guided as much by a desire to help others as by business acumen  --  such as his 1998 purchase of Polaris Southern Sports , a small all-terrain vehicle dealership in his hometown of Brookhaven , Miss . <p> Ricky Salyer , who is still one of Ebbers ' Sunday school students , owns a Polaris dealership in nearby Jackson . He says Ebbers paid a premium for the business to help the seller , a local family , pay its debts and fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was more or less a donation , and a very good-hearted one , " says Salyer , who was also interested in buying the dealership . " I do n't know of any business venture that ( Ebbers ) entered for Bernie , " Salyer says . " He did n't need the money . He absolutely spread his wealth around . " <p> * Poor management . While Ebbers won praise as a dealmaker , becoming the toast of Wall Street in the 1990s , his management skills in the wake of WorldCom 's fall have drawn severe criticism . <p> Former U.S. attorney general Richard Thornburgh , appointed by the bankruptcy court to study WorldCom 's failure , said in a recent report that WorldCom 's many acquisitions were poorly integrated and that strategic planning  --  headed by Ebbers  --  was especially weak . In hindsight , many investors also allege that WorldCom 's torrid growth , which fueled its stock price and Ebbers ' reputation , stemmed more from rapid mergers than shrewd management . <p> Over two decades , WorldCom and Ebbers pulled off some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1998 was , at the time announced , the biggest ever . <p> After Ebbers pulled off a merger , he was consumed with cost-cutting , former associates say . He reviewed all budgets , did away with free coffee and encouraged a culture in which employees would often drive instead of fly to sales appointments up to 400 miles away . <p> Meanwhile , big problems festered . Dozens of acquisitions at one time left WorldCom with 55 billing systems , leading to frequent mistakes . Ebbers lunched often with WorldCom 's then-CFO , Scott Sullivan , accused of orchestrating WorldCom 's accounting scam , yet Ebbers maintains he knew nothing of the fraud . <p> Likewise , the few times Ebbers visited Intermarine , he focused on things that were easiest to understand , say former employees . He slashed the marketing budget , criticized the allotment of cellphones , ditched the water cooler and fretted over heating bills . <p> Meanwhile , Intermarine missed opportunities , says Felix Sabates , chairman and co-owner of Trinity Yachts in New Orleans and founder of marketing firm TSC . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1998 . He and other experts say Intermarine should have focused on profitable repair work as the economy faltered and yacht sales fell . <p> Also , he says , it erred in not building yachts that customers designed themselves . Sabates says some of Intermarine 's boats sold for 25% less than what it would cost his company to build them . " Bernie did n't know any better , " he says . <p> Intermarine declined comment , as did its former chief operating officer , Conboy , who was fired by Ebbers in October . <p> * Stock deals . Just as Ebbers used WorldCom stock to pull off many acquisitions , he also used it to grow his other businesses . Thornburgh says Ebbers used WorldCom shares to secure more than $ 1 billion in personal and business loans , including loans on behalf of Ebbers ' alma mater , Mississippi College , Ebbers ' Canadian ranch and one hotel business . Thornburgh says it also includes loans to Joshua Timberlands . Three lenders say that $ 334 million they lent to Joshua Timberlands was not secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he used his WorldCom stock as collateral , former associates say , Ebbers told them he felt like his outside business investments were essentially " free . " As the stock rose , he would use his new wealth to fund more outside ventures  --  just as he did when building WorldCom . <p> Both strategies backfired once WorldCom 's stock started tanking . Without a rich stock to make purchases , WorldCom 's growth faltered . In Ebbers ' personal businesses , lenders who accepted stock as collateral started calling in loans . <p> WorldCom , fearing that Ebbers would sell big chunks of stock to pay lenders , further hurting WorldCom 's share price , lent him more than $ 400 million . Lawmakers have criticized that , saying WorldCom shareholders should not suffer because of Ebbers ' personal financial woes . <p> * Loyalty . Ebbers was loyal to friends , family and even to Mississippi . But his loyalty sometimes came at the expense of smart decisions . <p> In 2000 , Ebbers rescued an ailing Mississippi trucking firm , KLLM , from a hostile takeover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CEO , Jack Liles , who also was a friend . Liles feared an outsider would cut jobs , people familiar with the transaction say . Ebbers and Liles amassed some $ 30 million to take the firm private . KLLM 's financial results are no longer disclosed , but the refrigerated-trucking sector has fallen on hard times . <p> Ebbers also proudly built WorldCom in Mississippi , even though global communications companies usually were based in major cities . Newly hired WorldCom Chairman and CEO Michael Capellas plans to run WorldCom from the Washington area  --  where regulators are and where MCI was based . <p> Ebbers also lifted the fortunes of neighbors , friends and family . In the mid-1990s , he bought a majority stake in Columbus Lumber in his hometown to help the local owner avoid selling the family business to wood-and-paper giant Georgia-Pacific , people familiar with the matter say . The lumber mill is still in business and is still run by the same family . <p> Meanwhile , his son-in-law , Jay Bourne , oversees Ebbers ' outside ventures along with Mark Lewis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workingman ' image <p> Despite his wealth , Ebbers maintained a workingman 's image . He often wore boots and jeans . He loved his yacht  --  but not the image it projected or the money it cost to take it out , former employees say . <p> Today , he faces far different challenges . <p> His net worth had dropped to less than $ 300 million a year ago , Thornburgh 's report notes , down from $ 1.4 billion . It 's probably much less now because his primary asset was his WorldCom stock . According to Securities and Exchange Commission filings , Ebbers owned 14.4 million WorldCom shares in May . That stake would be worth about $ 3 million today , and likely will be wiped out when WorldCom emerges from Chapter 11 . <p> The Justice Department has yet to conclude its probe into WorldCom 's accounting fraud , so Ebbers could possibly still face charges . Shareholders and lenders , too , could end up going after assets that WorldCom can not claim . <p> These days , the increasingly gaunt Ebbers is apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a condominium , and Brookhaven , where he was spotted recently pushing a grocery cart around the Piggly Wiggly store . <p> Still , few are counting him out . Even his critics say he could make a comeback if he focused his talents on one company or at least a manageable number . <p> " It would be very difficult for him to start from scratch all over again , because I do n't know if he can look at the small picture , " says Sabates . " But he 's extremely talented and intelligent , and no one can take that away from him . " <p> Ebbers ' falling worth <p> Bernie Ebbers ' net worth has plummeted as the value of his primary asset , his WorldCom stock , plunged .
