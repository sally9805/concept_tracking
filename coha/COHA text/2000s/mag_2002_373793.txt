In the ' 60s , Bob Crane ( Greg Kinnear ) was an L.A. disc jockey . Then he became the star of the TV series Hogan 's Heroes . In due course , abetted by a video geek named John Carpenter ( Willem Dafoe ) , he became a sex addict . This destroyed his career . Reduced to the dinner-theater circuit , he met lots of willing women and took pictures of them in flagrante with the equipment Carpenter supplied . Then he was murdered , almost certainly by Carpenter . Auto Focus tells this story as affectlessly as we just have . It 's a conscious aesthetic choice by director Paul Schrader , not an accident of ineptitude . But no matter  --  his objectification of sad and stupid material is neither tragic nor transgressive . It is just undramatic and uninvolving.  --  By Richard Schickel <P> Imagine a murdered man in the upstairs bedroom and the 8 Women in his life left to decide whodunit . What would they do ? Bitch , bitch , bitch  --  and then break into song . Francois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deneuve , Ludivine Sagnier , Virginie Ledoyen , Danielle Darrieux , Isabelle Huppert , Firmine Richard , Emmanuelle Beart and Fanny Ardant ) for a game of hide-and-shriek , with each star given a guilty secret and a solo chanson . Ozon , the bright hope of French pop cinema ( Water Drops on Burning Rocks , Under the Sand ) , lets the gals get a bit too chatty and catty . But he knows how to dress them in glamorous frocks and attitudes . Seduction is more important than deduction in this chic display of star quality to the eighth power .  --  By Richard Corliss <P> You watch the spooky , unlabeled videotape , and seven days later you die . So goes the urban legend that was the basis of a Japanese pop phenomenon  --  a movie trilogy , TV series and comics . The Ring is the American spin-off , stylishly directed by Gore Verbinski and well acted by an appealing cast , led by Mulholland Drive 's Naomi Watts . She 's a reporter looking for a logical explanation for her niece 's death and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , and that proves to be a problem . What she discovers is a conventional mother-child psychodrama that does n't persuasively match up with the film 's supernatural elements . You keep waiting for someone to explain who shot , edited and distributed the Bunuel-on-a-bad-day video . The result is an edgy , watchable film , but one that makes you feel more squeamish than screamish.  --  R.S.
