If opening day is heaven on earth for deer hunters , then the final 48 hours can be purgatory . All too often , these last two days become an anguishing , demoralizing wait for a buck that never materializes , because hunters are using the same methods they used early in the season . After weeks of hunting activity , whitetails will no longer come to you . You have to go to them . That 's the first step : Leave your favorite stand for next year and start searching areas that you either have avoided or have n't bothered to hunt . THINK THICK The heavier the hunting pressure , the more important it is to be aggressive , says habitat expert Grant Woods , who helped Mossy Oak develop the BioLogic line of food-plot plants . " By the last days of the season , deer are masters at avoiding hunters who follow routine , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitor their exact locations . Once they get pressured , you 'd never believe they were in the area if it were n't for the GPS signal . They become largely nocturnal , especially the bucks , and they spend days holed up in sanctuaries where they know they wo n't be disturbed . " Focusing on an area where deer take refuge is a great step toward tagging a last-day buck . Usually that requires diving into the thickest , nastiest stuff around , but good sanctuary cover can be anything that other hunters do n't bother with . It can be a brushy hedgerow in open farmland , a steep forested hillside , a strip of tall CRP grassland , a dense cattail marsh , or a woodlot that is either too small or too out of the way to draw most hunters ' attention . Size does n't matter : If it can hide a pheasant or a snowshoe hare , it can hide a pressured buck . I stumbled upon my first such zone several years ago by accident . It was the last day of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided we 'd rather spend the December morning shooting ducks than chasing phantom whitetails . The blackpowder deer season was still open . More out of habit than design , I stowed my muzzleloader in the boat before we shoved off for a small island on Lake Champlain . After two numbing hours in a makeshift shore blind , I decided to warm my toes by taking the frontloader for a walk . Thirty minutes later I was dragging a fat 6-pointer back to my disbelieving buddy . The brushy , 50-acre island positively crawled with deer , many of which had no doubt fled the nearby mainland during the November rifle season . Now I hit several similar hiding places whenever crunch time finds me with an unfilled tag . My favorite spot is a low rise in a large river-bottom swamp that can only be reached via a half-mile slog in hip boots . Any undisturbed bedding area is a sanctuary and thus a prime candidate for a last-chance buck . Many hunters wo n't enter known bedding areas , especially on private land , for fear of disrupting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when there is no next week , you have to be bold . NOW-OR-NEVER STRATEGIES General tactics for hunting refuge areas are the same as in any deer hunting situation . But the execution of them during this period is very different . For instance : Organizing large drives is a popular method in many regions , but pressured bucks are loath to leave thick cover and seldom move along predictable routes . Far better are " soft " two- or three-man drives into the wind . The idea is to move deer without their knowing that they 're being pushed . Two styles work well : staggered drives , in which two or more hunters push quietly into thick cover at offset intervals , with one hunter bringing up the rear ; and circle drives , in which one hunter posts in the center of thick cover , while another works the periphery . Both types take advantage of a buck 's natural tendency to remain in thick cover and swing around downwind of a disturbance . Still-hunting can also be productive , especially when snow covers the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind off your back to avoid spreading scent in front of you , move ever so slowly , and constantly scan ahead and to the sides for any sign of deer . Most of the deer will be obscured by the surroundings , so look for an eye , an ear , or a leg instead of the entire animal . In thick , woody cover  --  where you should be hunting  --  it can take an hour to cover 100 yards . Whether driving or still-hunting , do n't wait until the middle of the day , as most hunters do earlier in the season . Start as early in the day as possible . At first light , you 're more likely to catch deer on the move and thus off guard . Stand hunting has its place , but it too requires a careful , stealthy approach . Forget about hunting from a permanent stand now . The key is to get into a previously undisturbed bedding area with a portable climbing or hanging stand well before dawn . Minimize scent and set up as quietly as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to stay put . " You want to get into a heavy bedding area real early and set your stand up almost exactly where you think they 'll bed , because they 're not going to move far during the day , " says Ted Marum , the owner-operator of Buffalo County Outfitters in west-central Wisconsin . Marum guides hunters during the first week of the nine-day firearms season and saves the tail end for himself . He prefers it that way , in fact , since most hunters are not willing to do what it takes to bag a last-chance buck . " It 's a one-shot deal . Once you climb down you 're probably going to blow your cover , so bring a pee bottle to avoid dispersing your scent and lunch , and spend the entire day there if you can . " Last year , on the next to last day of the Wisconsin firearms season , Marum did just that . His reward came when he watched a 13-pointer sneak in and bed down not 50 yards from his stand . Hunting sanctuary areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the place will be useless for the rest of the season . But staying in camp or at home only guarantees that your tag will go unpunched . THE LAST-CHANCE STAND If you want the best possible opportunity for a last-minute buck , put a stand in a bedding area before the season begins . Then do n't go near it . " I have stands in some of the thickest , nastiest bedding cover we have , " says Ted Marum . " I only check them once in the spring or very early in the fall , and I only hunt them the last day or two of the season . But when I need them the most , they 're ready , so I do n't have to disturb an area by going in and hanging a stand . " Because you will be able to hunt a bedding area only once or twice before deer get wise , make sure your stand provides optimum coverage of the surroundings .  --  L.P. THE FINAL HOUR The final minutes of the season are ticking away and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember that deer are slaves to their guts , so go watch a food source  --  but not just any one . An overlooked food source in and around thick escape cover is best . This can be a small , isolated food plot ; a thicket of young , woody browse ; a hidden stand of oaks with remnant acorns ; or a woody stream bottom with the last green forbs and mushrooms of the fall . In areas with limited hunting pressure , watch the back edge of an open farm , particularly cut corn or standing soybeans . If tracks or previous sightings indicate that it is being used by does , so much the better . Sit tight .  --  L.P.

Under any other circumstance , nothing could have brought her near this building where baleful apprehension hung heavy in the air like the stink of tallow , but the man who lived here , Richard Topcliffe , was her last hope . She had been to the court of law , and the justice merely shook his head dismissively and said that even had he believed her-and that , he said with a scowl , was as unlikely as apple blossom in November-there was nothing he could do for her . <br> The constable had been no more helpful .

" <br> Now , outside Topcliffe 's house in the snow-flecked street , close by St. Margaret 's churchyard in Westminster , Rose sat and waited . She had knocked at the door once already , and it had been answered by a sturdy youth with a thin beard who looked her up and down with distaste and told her to go away . She refused and he closed the door in her face . The intense cold would have driven anyone else home to sit at the fireside wrapped in blankets , but Rose would not go until she had seen Topcliffe and begged him to help . <br> The bitter embers of sunlight dipped behind the edifices of St. Margaret 's and the Abbey , and the cold grew deeper . Rose was fair , young , no more than seventeen with a face that , in other times , sparkled with smiles .
