TRAVELS Headnote Visitors to Barbados can see where George Washington slept-really Photograph A sugar mill at St. Nicholas Abbey , a seventeenth-century estate // " It 's a totally educated guess , " said Penelope Hynam , " but we can surmise reasonably , and be about ninety-five percent certain , that this was George Washington 's bedroom . " The room in question is in the corner of the George Washington House , a rectangular yellow building on a low bluff between a horse track and a forested gulley just outside of Bridgetown , Barbados . Hynam , the director of the house , pointed out some of the original beams , from 1719 , and noted that Washington 's presumed bedroom ceiling would have been not much over six feet high when he lodged here , in late 1751 . Washington stood some six foot three . " George did n't say anything about ducking , but I 'm sure he had to , " she said . It 's a peculiar image : the statuesque Washington stooping through a low-ceilinged house in the Caribbean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alabaster formality-the historian Joseph Ellis has called him " the original marble man " - and one tends to visualize him rigidly crossing the Delaware through ice floes or striding among beleaguered troops during the long winter at Valley Forge . It 's jarring to imagine him at ease among palm trees and on sunny beaches with tropical drinks . ( Washington separately mentioned both rum and pineapple in his journal , but regrettably there is no record of his ever combining the two , let alone adding coconut milk . ) Photograph The George Washington House // Washington was one of the most widely traveled of colonial Americans when it came to his own country . Yet for all his errand-running up and down the Eastern Seaboard and across the Appalachians , he never ventured to Great Britain or Europe , as did Adams , Jefferson , and Franklin . His trip to Barbados , at age nineteen , was the only time he ever left American soil . He was accompanying his tubercular half brother , Lawrence , who was sent to the tropics on the advice of a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was basically his junior year abroad , an eye-opening trip that would influence his later outlook on politics and life . " Historians throughout American history have ignored this journey , " said Hynam , who is overseeing the restoration of the house and the creation within it of a museum , slated to open in January 2007 . " Almost any biography of George Washington gives it maybe a paragraph or two . Which is incredible-they really have n't used their minds on this one . " Longtime island visitors sometimes grouse that Barbados has lost much of its Caribbean-ness . It 's become too modern , they say , too traffic-choked , and , in short , has committed the sin of becoming too prosperous . The main highway near Bridgetown is cluttered with auto dealerships , squat office buildings , and boxy gas stations , and the low coastal hills are dotted with red-tile-roofed mini-estates corralled in tidy subdivisions . Pricey resorts occupy prime beachfront along the western coast , where beachgoers are shielded from the northeasterly trade winds by geography and from outside untidiness by guards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Much of the interior is filled with improbably green sugarcane fields , which look like heroically overgrown lawns . And the eastern side still has an open wildness to it , largely undeveloped and raked by the winds . Prosperity is not a new phenomenon here . Tiny Barbados-about one-seventh the size of Rhode Island-was at one time arguably the wealthiest and most sophisticated society in the hemisphere . Great fortunes had been built on sugar and slavery in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , and the sugar barons spared little expense in splicing the cultural DNA of England onto their densely populated island . The Washington brothers arrived on Barbados in November 1751 and were welcomed by Major Gedney Clarke , with whom they were acquainted through family connections . They visited the Clarke home " with some reluctance , " George wrote in his journal , because the household had recently been beset by smallpox . His instincts were sound : two weeks later , he " was strongly attacked " by the pox , which kept him housebound for nearly a month and gave him his famously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more : a lifelong immunity , which proved handy when the disease ravaged his troops during the Revolutionary War . The brothers eventually rented a house from one Captain Croftan , the commander of a nearby fort . They paid fifteen pounds a month " exclusive of Liquors &; washing , " though not without some grumbling . Records have surfaced indicating that Croftan had earlier rented the house for ten pounds a month , thus giving Washington the distinction of being possibly the first American tourist hosed by an islander . Other details about Washington 's stay on Barbados are sketchy . He was never chatty in his journal , and he made no entries at all during the month he was sick . What 's more , some of the journal pages have rotted away , and others were lost when the nineteenth-century historian and Harvard President Jared Sparks sliced them up in order to give friends and autograph hunters souvenirs of Washington 's handwriting . So little was known of Washington 's visit to Barbados that for decades people who wanted to see where he slept were directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yacht club had been misidentified by amateur historians in 1912 , and the mistake persisted until recently , in part because the house was featured on a Barbados stamp , and in part because the owner had grown fond of the plaque and proved churlish about taking it down . Most serious historians , however , believed all along that the authentic Washington house was the one next door to the present-day horse track . But it was n't until 1989 that researchers happened upon documents that proved it beyond dispute . The house was placed in the care of the Barbados National Trust in the late 1990s , and since then the structure and grounds have been subject to exhaustive investigations . During my first visit , two years ago , the building looked like a roast turkey the day after Thanksgiving ; it had been torn apart by architectural historians trying to figure out the original floor plan . ( No small task : the house underwent major changes in the 1830s and 1870s , and more recently served as accommodations for employees of the local power company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1870 , when the second floor was added . Inside , the first floor will be sparely furnished to look as it did during Washington 's visit , albeit with higher ceilings . The second floor will feature exhibits on eighteenth-century Barbados and the island 's ties with the northern colonies . " It 's a fabulous detective project , " Hynam said . As is figuring out how Barbados influenced Washington 's character . " It must have had a profound effect on a nineteen-year-old with a bright , inquiring mind , " Hynam said . While in Barbados , Washington attended his first professional London play ( George Barnwell , a Tragedy ) . He had the chance to observe advanced agricultural techniques employed on an intensely cultivated island . He studied military fortifications of a type he 'd never seen before . He noted the vast gap between the wealthy and the poor , and the absence of a middle class . He saw the effects of a colonial system that had , as in Virginia , left many planters mired in debt to the mother country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt heard what happened to the Stuarts who rose up against the king in 1745 ( the luckier ones were exiled to Barbados ) . It was among his most personal encounters with the Anglocentric high society he would later rebel against . The island , which was once commonly referred to as " Little England , " flew the British flag without interruption between 1627 and 1966 . A statue of Lord Nelson stands in the former Trafalgar Square ( renamed National Heroes Square in 1999 ) . American travelers to Barbados today can walk in Washington 's footsteps and marvel at a culture that is both familiar and exotic . I stayed at Cobblers Cove , a former sugar planter 's beach house recast as an elegant small resort . The guest rooms have wicker chairs , languorous ceiling fans , and Edwardian-era prints of tropical plants ; guests may feel as though they 've walked into one of those British Campaign spreads in a Pottery Barn catalog . Impish green monkeys of the sort seen on retro colonial-empire upholstery played outside on the grounds , at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine ball . The hotel was populated chiefly by British tourists ( none of whom , evidently , had received the memo about sandals and black socks ) . At breakfast on a terrace overlooking the ocean , toast arrived upright in a tidy stainless-steel rack , accompanied by shot-glass-sized containers of marmalade . In the afternoons , tea and what appeared to be crumpets were set out near a patio . The island 's Anglo antiquity is as much a draw as its palm-fringed beaches and upscale restaurants . Like Washington , I spent my days examining forts and sugarcane fields , which are dotted with the stumps of old stone windmills . I dropped in at several venerable estates , including Sunbury Plantation House , which dates back more than three centuries and stands with a grave dignity amid a shady thicket . It 's now a museum with a courtyard restaurant ; the cellar and second-floor bedrooms have been given over to artifacts with neatly handwritten labels , including " pond grass scraper " and " Victorian knickers . " More impressive still is St. Nicholas Abbey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gables and coral stone finials . Reached through an alle of mahogany trees , it has the feel of a fugitive estate from a Jane Austen novel , muffled in an ancient silence interrupted from time to time by the insane screech of the guinea fowl that roam the grounds with a haughty and proprietary air . The birds sometimes charge at visitors , forcing them to take evasive measures involving brisk , awkward steps . Which brings to mind cricket . Islanders are daft about the sport . You can see it played informally on various grounds around the island , or catch periodic matches at the Kensington Oval . ( The World Cup finals will be held here next year . ) I know as much about cricket as I do about crumpets . Washington had the London theater to make him feel like a slack-jawed rube from the provinces ; I had cricket . No matches were scheduled during my stay , but I watched children being coached on a neighborhood pitch , and later stopped by the Centre for Cricket Excellence 's Walk of Fame on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside Bridgetown . I took the time to admire a list of every West Indian batsman who 'd scored a " century , " and every bowler who 'd effected five or more " dismissals . " ( A century , I was later informed , is a score of 100 points by an individual player , and a dismissal is something like an out in baseball . ) Here was foreign travel at its best : when you find yourself in a fugue state , where people speak a familiar language , yet all you hear is intoxicating jibberish . This was , I believe with about 95 percent certainty , the state in which George Washington spent at least part of his sojourn abroad .
