" I 'll bet that trinket cost Raymond an arm and a leg . " Dr. Natalie Carmichael tore her gaze from the diamond solitaire pendant she fingered and glanced up as her nurse , sagging from end-of-the-day fatigue , shuffled into her cramped office carrying a stack of yellow patient folders . At the tired reference to her husband 's prosthetic limb sales job , Natalie lifted one corner of her mouth . " Ha , ha . Wait , here 's a spot . " She moved the phone to make room for the files , her husband 's voice still fresh in her mind . God , she missed him this week ! After lightening her load , Sara leaned forward and cooed at the large stone . " If you ever get tired of that generous man of yours , I 'll take him off your hands . " Her friend 's words fed the guilt gnawing at Natalie 's stomach . Yes , the pendant was exquisite , but something about it ... something about her husband over these last few months ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely . She swiveled forward in her soft leather chair and smirked . " Eat your heart out , Sara . Raymond 's a one-woman man . " " Dirty shame , too . That man is like a pot of warm honey , just begging to be spread around . Anniversary ? " " Uh-hmm . " " Five years ? " " Six this weekend , but he always gives me gifts early . " " The man 's a gem , I tell you . " Then Sara 's mouth drooped . " Unlike my Joey . " Glad for Sara 's gabby distraction , Natalie dropped the long-chained pendant insideher thin sweater to keep it out of the way while she finished her paperwork . " I thought you were growing rather fond of Joey . " " I was . I am . But ... he cleaned my gutters last night . " " Is that some kind of lurid small-town Missouri analogy ? " Sara laughed . " No . He really cleaned my gutters . " " And ? " " And he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly . " And ? " " And a guy like Joey does n't leave his tools just anywhere . I think he 's going to propose . " She bit back a smile at the woman 's rationale , especially since her nurse had demonstrated an uncanny knack for sizing up people in theft six-month liaison . Sara could practically diagnose a patient 's problempsychological and physiologicalby looking at their teeth and fingernails . " Are you going to say yes ? " Sara perched a generous hip on the corner of the rosewood desk . " I have n't decided . But Joey 's handy at fixing things , and my house sure could use a new roof . " Natalie lifted an eyebrow . " You ca n't marry him for a few shingles . " " Of course not . I 'll hold out for a gazebo , too . " Natalie wagged a finger . " Admit it , you like the guy . " Sara wrinkled her petite nose . " He 's kind of crummy in bed . " " I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a marriage make . " " Hmm . Easy for you to sayyou and Raymond are still on your honeymoon . " Longing pooled in her stomach at the mere thought of her husband 's grin ... He still moved her . " Being away from each other so much keeps things new , I suppose . " She dragged the folders toward her . " How many patients today ? I lost count . " " Fifty-two . Did you get to eat lunch ? " " I found a bag of sunflower seeds in a drawer . " " No wonder you 're so skinny . If you want a snack , Mrs. Raglan just dropped off a plate of oatmeal Scotties because her knee feels so much better . " Natalie smiled fondly . " That was n't necessary . " " She swears you healed her . " " Me and a syringe of cortisone . I 'm afraid her relief is temporary . " Sara shrugged . " You can do no wrong in the eyes of the folks around here . " She pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Joey and I are taking in both shows at the dollar theater tonightwant to tag along ? " Natalie shook her head . " I 've put off unpacking Raymond 's book collection far too long . The moving boxes are driving me nuts . Thanks anyway . " She rolled her wrist to check the time . " Why do n't you take off ? I 'll lock up . " " Thanks , I will . See you tomorrow . " Sara turned at the door . " Oh ... your brother called again . " Her eyes glowed with curiosity , but Natalie simply forged a smile and thanked her for taking the message . Alone , she massaged a sudden pain in her right temple . In the tidy room she wanted her life to be , her brother was an upturned area rug . Tony , the family thief , had been granted an early parole from the state penitentiary and needed a place to stay once he left the halfway housejust until he got back on his feet , he 'd assured her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd declared in a charming voice when he called last weekend . Natalie suspected his thoughts ran more toward her beloved bank account , but as his closest living relative , she felt morally obligated to help him . Still , unease needled her . She resented the threat of his appearance in her well-ordered lifea private , quiet existence she 'd come to guard jealously . The worshipful respect the locals lavished upon her made her feel special . What would her patients think when they discovered that not only was her brother an ex-con , but that she 'd brought him to live in their midst ? Torn , she 'd stalled Tony until she could discuss his " visit " with Raymond , but she 'd purposely neglected to mention Tony 's name when her husband had called earlier to let her know what time he 'd be home Friday . He barely tolerated her brother , leaving Natalie struggling between loyalties to the two men . She tossed two aspirin to the back of her throat and swallowed them dry . The door opened again and Sara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stragglerfellow with indigestion . " Natalie sighed , She 'd wanted the life of a small-town doctor , but by five-thirty on Wednesday of a spring stomach-virus outbreak week , the job 's romantic appeal had dimmed . A split second later she chastised herself . " Sure , I 'll see him . " " I thought you might , " Sara said , pulling a new yellow folder from behind her back and walking it over . " Mr. Butler is forty-three years old , no family history of heart disease , blood pressure is good . He 's also deficient in vitamin A. " She tapped her temple and mouthed " the eyes , " in answer to Natalie 's unasked question . " Thanks , Sara . You can go on home . " Sara lowered her voice to a rolling whisper , as if the man were crouched outside the door . " He looks dangerousmaybe I 'd better stick around . " Accustomed to her nurse 's melodrama , Natalie simply smiled . " That 's not necessary . Which room ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice evening . " Natalie sat unmoving as the paneled door swung shut . In the distance , she heard the distinct clack of the heavy front door closing . Suddenly exhausted , she held the folder with both hands , and stared blindly at the man 's name and address printed in caps . Her brother was encroaching , and Raymond was withdrawing , or so it seemed . After six years of a part-time marriage due to his travel schedule , she yearned for more emotional intimacy . But she was beginning to think her happy-go-lucky husband was afraid , if not incapable , of true closeness . At least with her . Why Raymond 's indefinable retreat had converged in her mind today , she could n't fathom . He 'd sounded normal on the phoneeven anxious to arrive home . To her knowledge , their basically happy marriage was no less intact today than yesterday . So why did she have this , this ... premonition that crisis lurked just around the corner ? After a few minutes of numbing muse , she pushed herself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care if she was facing personal dilemmashe probably wanted to go home and eat pork barbecue . In the hallway , she conjured up a smile , then opened the squeaky door to the Blue Room . Mr. Butler , a big man , sat near the door on a diminutive chair , surrounded by cloud-blue walls , his hands resting on wide knees . From his physique , one might think he was a professional athlete , but his clothing betrayed him . His tie hung loose at the collar , his shirtsleeves rolled up to his elbows . His jacket lay folded on the padded examination table . He was darkly handsome , decidedly unkempt , and she immediately understood why Sara had described him as dangerous . A white scar extended from his hairline , running to just above his left eyebrow , hinting of an old injury severe enough to have caused a concussionat the very least . " Good afternoon , Mr. Butler , I 'm Dr. Carmichael . " His gaze darted to her legs , then he gave her a friendly nod . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she retrieved a mechanical pencil from her pocket . Careful to keep her skirt from riding up , she lowered herself onto a stool with rollers and opened his file . A simple case , in and out . Her thoughts skipped ahead to dinnera salad sounded good . A haft-cake of goat cheese lay languishing in the fridge . " What seems to be the trouble ? " " The trouble , " the man said , his voice polite but rueful , " is that your husband 's luck ran out . " Natalie glanced up from the file and blinked . " Excuse me ? " He turned and with one long-armed reach , locked the door . Disbelief bolted through her , her mind reeling at the possible ramifications of her carelessness . Sara had been right . As usual . She propelled the stool and herself into the farthest corner , then scrambled to her feet . " Leave now , or I 'll scream . " As an afterthought , she held up her pencil like an ice pick . Instead , the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger , his demeanor almost weary . " Lead poisoning is a serious matter , Doc . Relax , I 'm not going to hurt you . Your husband owes me money , and I 'm here simply to collect a late payment . " Natalie found her voice cowering in the back of her throat . " II do n't know what you 're talking about . " He smiled sadly , his dark eyes crinkling at the corners . " Sorry to be the bearer of bad news , but your husband is a gambler , among other things . And worse , he 's a bad gambler . " He sighed . " I need your jewelry . " Natalie shook her head slowly , her hand involuntarily moving to cover her wedding ring . " You 're not serious . " " ' Fraid so , " he said , leaning over to reach into a bulging jacket pocket . A gun . He had a gun . Or a blade . All thugs carried a blade . Natalie threw her head back and unleashed a shrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old building , but hoping he 'd be spooked . Instead , he winced , then poked a finger in his ear . " Please do n't do that . God knows I hear enough screeching at home . " Instead of a weapon , he withdrew a sheath of rolled-up papers , then spread them on the examining table . Natalie stared at him , searching her mind for the location of the closest asylum . Perhaps he had wandered away during finger-painting class . " Who are you ? " He pointed to the patient folder lying facedown on the floor . " It says right thereBrian Butler . " " But ... but why would my husband owe you money ? " " Because he borrowed it and did n't pay it back . " Natalie relaxed a fraction of an inchthe guy was dim . " You obviously have my husband confused with someone else . " " Raymond Carmichael , forty-two , drives a ninety-nine green Bonneville , and sells plastic legs for a living . " " Prostheses , " she corrected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tomato , tomahto . " Natalie swallowed hard . Could Raymond possibly be mixed up with such a shady character ? " Why should I believe that my husband owes you money ? " " Because I do n't lie . And , " he nodded toward the table , " I have his signature on the loan papers , If you do n't believe me , check them out . " He smiled wryly , then extended his hand , palm up . " But , first , surrender your weapon . " When she did n't move , he wiggled his fingers . " Come on , lady . I have to pick up my kids from daycare in twenty minutes . " He did n't seem intent on harming her , so Natalie relinquished her pencil and warily approached the table . The forms were numerous , but simple : the amount of the loan , the astronomical interest rate , the collateral , the signature . The numbers swam before her eyes , as did Raymond 's telltale signature . A signature that pledged her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have signed over the title of their home without her permission , her mind screamed . But then she remembered that he could because she 'd assigned him her power of attorney when they closed on the condo in St. Louis two years ago . She looked back to the stranger , laughing with incredulity . " There must be over a hundred thousand dollars ' worth of loans here . " He made a sympathetic sound with his cheek . " Sorry , Doc . The wife is always the last to know . " Natalie frowned , " What are you , some kind of a loan shark ? " His mouth twitched down at the corners . " I own a pawn business , and I make loans to my customers . Ray 's a good customer . " He pulled a calculator from his back pocket , then bent over the table to scrutinize the appraisal forms . " Okay , let 's get this over with . I 'm looking for an emerald cocktail ring . " Outraged , she jerked her hands behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He rubbed his eyes with thumb and forefinger , then said , " Work with me , here , Doc . This is so much better than me having to come to your house . " He was bluffing . " You do n't know where we live . " " White brick , navy shutters , messy back yard . " She shoved her chin in the air . " It 's an English garden . " " Yeah , whatever . I 'm doing you a favor here . If I get the sheriff involved , the whole damn town will know your business . " " Oh , well , as long as you 're doing me a favor . " He shook his head , tsk-tsking . " You 're wasting time . " The entire situation was starting to seem legitimate , frighteningly so . " I need to discuss this with Raymond . " " Later , " he said . " When I 'm eating Happy Meals with my kids . " " H-How about if I write you a check ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need ? " " About five thousand , and I do n't take checks . " Natalie swallowed . " Cash , " she said , gesturing toward the door . " Follow me to an ATM and I 'll give you cash . " " Have you checked your balances lately , Dr. Carmichael ? " She balked . " Two days ago . " He looked sympathetic . " I 've seen Raymond put down ten gees on a single dog race . In two days , he could bankrupt the national treasury . " He withdrew his wallet and extracted a business card , then handed it to her . BUTLER FAMILY PAWN , BRIAN BUTLER , OWNER AND MANAGER . GOLD BOUGHT AND SOLD BY THE OUNCE . WE LOAN MONEY TO ANYONE , AND WE MEAN ANYONE . He gave her a pointed look . " Now , for the last time , Dr. Carmichaelone emerald cocktail ring . " Feeling helpless , she removed the ring from her finger , then threw it at him , aiming for an eye . He caught it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's monocle , he held the ring up to the light for a few seconds , then punched in a number on the calculator , his fingers too big for the buttons . He dropped the ring onto a snowy handkerchief spread on the table . " Next , one pair of diamond stud earrings , total weight , two point five carats . " Her hands flew to her earlobes . " These were my aunt'sthey 're family heirlooms ! " " Lucky for Raymond , your aunt had good taste in jewelry . " Cut to the quick , Natalie bit deep into her lip to stem her tears , but failed miserably . He winced and covered his face with his hand . " Oh , no , no , no . Stop with the tears , okay ? I 'm just trying to feed my family here . You married the bum , not me . " Furious , she sucked in her tears with a giant hiccup , then handed him the earrings with shaking hands . He inspected them and whistled . " Nice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And finally , one diamond solitaire pendant . " Remembering she 'd dropped the piece inside her sweater , she said , " I do n't have it with me . " His gaze fell to her chest , and the skin over her heart tingled . Slowly , very slowly , he moved to stand in front of her , zeroing in on the small lump of the pendant beneath her sweaterand not exactly ignoring the more sizable lumps on either side . Her face burned as she clutched her hand to her chest . " Come on , Doc , do n't make me take it from you . " " Raymond gave this pendant to me for our anniversary . " " I know , I sold it to him . By the way , happy anniversary . " Never before had she so thoroughly despised a person . " You ... are ... vile . " A scowl darkened his face , illuminating the scar . " Tell you what , Doc , I 'll give you a choice . The necklace " He snatched up her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger than her entire arm . " Or your wedding ring . " His voice was soft and teasing , offering a choice that was no choice at all . Quaking , she glanced down at the thick gold band , etched with gold leaves and studded with emeralds , designed by Raymond and custom-made for her . She would never part with it . " Let go of me , " she hissed . " And I 'll give you the necklace . " He released her fingers so abruptly , her arm shot back . Trembling , she lifted the necklace over her head , then pitched it across the floor , sending it skidding to the door . Chest heaving , she met his gaze and injected as much bravado into her voice as she could muster . " Now get out . " He stared at her for a few seconds , and when an emotion resembling pity shot through his eyes , she understood how one person could injure another in the red haze of rage . If she 'd had a gun , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when compromised , according to Gray 's Anatomy , posed a minimum threat to life while ensuring a maximum amount of pain . Emitting a soft laugh , the man turned and ripped off a pink carbon copy of the form he 'd been filling out . " Your receipt , " he said , then folded it neatly and pushed it to the edge of the table . He shoved the rest of the papers back into his jacket , which he draped over his corded arm . After gathering up the hanky , he crossed to scoop up the necklace and added it to the glittery pile . He shoved the small bundle into his pocket , then unlocked the door with a snap of his wrist . When a pained expression crossed his face , he touched a hand to his flat stomach . " Oh , by the way , Doc , I do have a touch of indigestion . " Seething , Natalie glared . " Lay off the Happy Meals . " Suddenly he smiled , revealing even , white teeth . Probably caps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mock salute , and walked out .
