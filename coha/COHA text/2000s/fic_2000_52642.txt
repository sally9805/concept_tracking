If Tananarive Due 's story in this issue has n't already gotten you worried about germs , this new tale from one of irony 's reigning queens will likely have you scrubbing your hands with some antibacterial goop . In fact , you might want to wash up before you read this one  --  really , just think of where this magazine might have <p> This story comes to Us from an unusual source , a theme anthology entitled The Touch edited by Patrick Merla that is due out in a month or two . The anthology 's theme , created by Steven-Elliot Altman , concerns " Deprivers " who can render people senseless with a passing touch . ( You can find out more at their Website , www.deprivers.com . ) The anthology is a Write Aid project and benefits from it go to two international charities , the Health Education AIDS Liaison and the Foundation for Advancement in Cancer Therapy . <p> " Do n't touch that , " Mother said , and I did n't . " Do n't go near that . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we all knew , or we sort of did . Terrible things . Staph infections that science ca n't touch , plus Mother said everybody knows you catch cancer off another person , and nobody wants to do that , " AIDS , " she said , " do n't even say it or you 'll get sick . " <p> She sounded so scared that Billy and me clung to her legs and bawled until she promised to keep us safe . The world is a hotbed . You 've seen the TV . Everybody who 's still out there is getting sick . Smallpox is ! rock , to say nothing of bubonic plague . Tuberculosis creeps up on your best friend without you knowing ; smile at them wrong and the next thing you know , you 've got it too . Quarantine ! Triple-locked doors , nurses in masks , they take out one lung and you get it in the other . <p> " I love you , " Mother said to us . " I 'd rather see you dead . " <p> Pestilence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine , run into the wrong person and the next , you are Infected . <p> " And you ca n't tell who 's sick ! They may look like you or me , " Mother told us , " but they do n't DO like we do . " That was the day she cut her friends off except for phone time , even though Margaret and Etta are clean as anybody and her best friends in the world , the world being where Father went that I am not allowed to go . <p> You could catch It ! <p> " What , Mother ? Catch what ? " <p> " Better safe than sorry , " Mother said . She loved her friends but she wiped off the mouthpiece every time they talked . <p> Then Margaret got necrotizing fascitis and they had to cut off her arm . Mother quit picking up the phone . " Germs , " she said , and for a while she was okay with talking on the speaker . " You can get them before you even know . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught herpes , so that was that . When Mother left off phoning , Etta and Margaret wrote letters , but you ca n't be too careful . When you 're scared of germs after a while you start getting scared of everything that might have been near germs . You 're scared of germs coming off of people and you 're scared of germs getting on things like envelope glue , even though the mail person has strict instructions to put your snail mail in the De-con box outside the front door . <p> We count on De-con to keep us safe . That plus the air lock . <p> The first De-con box cost us a bundle , Mother ordered it off the web after Uncle Seymour died of strep , he was the first , and the improved Decon Enhanced Support cost a heap of Father 's insurance money , but it is a fantastic service that allows us to go on living the way God meant us to , Uncontaminated . Safe . <p> That and the care Mother took , starting the first day the bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Flu , " Father said when he got in from work that day . " Everybody in the office is sick . " <p> " Daddy , Daddy . " Billy and me clamored around his legs . <p> Mother yelled , " Do n't touch him ! " and yanked us away . <p> Father said to her , " What are you doing ? " <p> " Stand back ! The whole world is a contagious ward . " <p> " Do n't worry , " Father said . " I 'm fine . " <p> " Do n't try and kid me , " Mother said . " There was a special report on TV , this is the worst flu ever . Plus , side effects ! And you were just out in it . " <p> " I did n't go anywhere , just to the office . " <p> " On the bus . That 's another hotbed . All those people , breathing on you . Who knows what you picked up ? And the office ! Out of the hotbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the workplace is the worst . " She handed Father his walking papers and shoved him out the door , which she locked and bolted . <p> He cried on the front lawn until Mother rolled a pup tent and a week 's worth of food off the roof . For days he camped outside our front window , calling . " Day four , and I 'm not even sneezing . Day five , and I 'm fine . Day six . . . . " <p> " Not yet , " our mother said . " We have to be sure . " <p> Then on the seventh morning , we heard him sneeze . " I did n't mean it , " he cried . " It was an acci  --  achoo ! " <p> " That does it ! " Mother screamed , and took the Glock Daddy kept under his pillow to protect us from burglars and started firing from the roof . " I love you , but go , " she yelled , being careful to hit the ground behind him as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're clean . " She fired again , herding him into the street . <p> We heard a screech . He got hit by a truck . <p> Of course we cried , but when it 's a matter of your own health and safety , you shut up fast . After all , I mean , first things first . Mother pulled herself together . " I 'll keep you safe , " she vowed . " No matter what it takes . " <p> " Okay , " Billy said , " Me and Dolly are going out to play . " <p> " Outside ! " Mother grabbed him . " Not on your life ! Something terrible could happen to you and you would n't even know . " <p> " But I want to go out and play . " Billy always was rebellious . He looked ready to hit and yell . <p> " Not now , " Mother said . " You neither , Doll , " she said to me . She shuttered the windows . Through De-con she ordered and mounted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and showed us how to use it . She sealed us in . " You 'll thank me later . This is for your own good . " <p> " When ? " I was scared and excited . Less excited than scared . <p> " Soon , I promise , just as soon as they get all these sick people put away . " <p> It was a little song she sang to keep us safe . AS SOON AS THEY GET ALL THESE SICK PEOPLE PUT AWAY . And every night we had a little party , cookies and ginger ale . We put on costumes and made jokes . Once a month we tested the defenses . Ready . Arm . Everything but fire . If one of Them tries to get in . . . . She made paper hats for us . " Are n't we having fun , " Mother said . She was laughing and laughing . " Are n't we having fun ! " <p> So Billy and me , we stayed in , and I can tell you we were damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as soon as they get all these sick people put away . " Truth ? There was a whole world out there that we were n't using , and I could hardly wait . <p> But here 's the trick of it . You ca n't get people put away when you do n't know which ones they are . <p> Mother said we would n't be in here long , but she worked on our armaments while we slept . It 's been a while , but at least I 'm safe . <p> So we have Mother to thank . And De-con . We never touch anything any sick person touched . <p> We order from Web-TV , no problem , De-con guarantees that no germs get into your food and none come in on the clothes you ordered off the web or from the Shopping Channel and what if it 's maybe a little lonely you can count on e-mailing eBay or Amazon.com and they 'll mail you back , you might get a computer virus but at least you are safe . Or , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone in and sometimes they put your phone call on TV . Imagine . You can tune in and hear yourself talking to the shopping host right there on the air ! Plus , you get safe , germ-free delivery of anything you want , from your Albanian Aardvark to a Jivaro shrunken head . Who needs to go out ? Our lives were full ! <p> I guess . <p> It 's interesting , sitting there in front of the TV-puter most of the day . You 're , like , CONNECTED to all the billions of others for as long as you stay logged on but you ca n't touch them , and this is weird . I was sitting in here protecting all my senses from contamination and all I wanted was to be touched . <p> I guess Billy did too . He said , " I want to go out and meet some people I 'm not related to . " <p> Mother smacked him . " No way . " <p> Oh , but we were safe . So safe ! See , hear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Get excited ordering it and then get excited waiting for it to come . Well , anything that got delivered to the De-con box and made it through the double-sealed de-germified air lock in our front hall . But what 's the point of the perfect dress if nobody sees you in it except your brother and your mom ? Billy and I would have had friends , I would have had cute guys to go out with , except Mother would n't let us go to school . <p> And I will tell you this about it . Mother did it because she loves us but home education is the pits . The whole world going on outside , we saw it on TV and on the web , and Billy and me stuck in Father 's den , which she had converted to the schoolroom , us and Mother . Sitting too close and breathing the same stale air . <p> " What do you think , class ? " <p> " I do n't know . What do you think , Mom ? " <p> It got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got big and started ogling all these women on TV . <p> " Stop that . That 's just Baywatch , " Mother said . <p> " I do n't care what it is , I want to go to the beach ! " He meant he wanted to go out in the world and consort with jiggly girls . <p> " That show 's so old those girls are probably dead . " Mother said , " Girls are n't like that anymore . " <p> " Prove it . " Oh my gosh he was ogling me . <p> I started to cry . <p> Mother smacked him . " You leave your sister alone . " <p> The next morning he was gone . <p> It 's amazing how Billy got out . He made it through the airlock and out of the De-con box . I tried but I was growing hips and boobs and they were getting in the way . Every once in a while he would try to phone but Mother would n't let me pick up . " That was your brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back but remember , he made his choice when he left us for the germs . Now I 'm warning you , NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES OR SAYS , DO N'T LET HIM IN . " <p> It 's okay , I did n't miss him too much . I went out on the Internet and met a lot of cool guys . Amazing what people will tell you when they ca n't see you . Amazing what you tell them . <p> Then Mother got sick . Except she did n't call it sick . How I knew there was something bad the matter was , she started teaching me how to run the world : where the money was , the pin numbers for all our accounts , how to make e-transfers to keep the De-con service and how to pay for the food and the clothes she ordered for us and how to accessorize . The jewelry she 'd gotten from the Shopping Channel , she divided into two heaps . <p> " This is for you . " She swept one pile my way . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be buried in this . " <p> " What 's buried ? " I said . <p> " Do n't worry , " she said . " It 's not contagious . And wherever God takes me , I promise , I 'll protect you to the grave . " <p> I did like she wanted . I took the DigiCam and after I did her makeup and laid her out in all her jewelry and the Melissa Rivers kaftan with the solid gold trim , I took lots of pictures and I posted them in the right place on the Web . Then I did like she ordered and put her down the Dispos-Al a little bit at a time . The bones I left in the De-con box and the De-con company took them away . He said through the intercom , " Are you okay in there ? " <p> " Never better , " I said . <p> Except it 's really quiet in here . <p> After she died everything was pretty much the same . Stuff kept coming  --  clean and safe . But safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessaries , I left off shopping . Nobody to dress up for , nobody to care . It was quiet as hell . One day at delivery time I left the air lock open and when the De-con signal went off to tell me the outside box was opening , I stuck my head in the hole so the delivery guy would hear me direct . " Come on in ! " <p> " Lady , you should n't do this . You could catch something . " <p> " You 're bonded , " I told him . " It 's okay . " <p> " You got no idea what 's out here . " <p> " Cute guys , " I said . " I saw them on TV . " <p> " But some of them are carrying terrible diseases . Women too ! " He sounded muffled ; okay he was talking through his De-con filter mask . In the surveill camera , he looked like he was wearing a gigantic rubber glove . Since Mother died I have n't talked to anyone direct and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , naked face to naked face . <p> " No problem , " I told him . I was wearing Mother 's Pamela Anderson outfit from QVC . " I 'll stay away from them . " <p> " Precautions , " the delivery man said . " No telling what you might run into out here . " <p> " At least I 'd be running into SOMETHING , " I said but I took his word for it and let it go by . Along with the days . Along with a lot of other days . <p> Until I found the ad on the web . SEX AND GLORY , the header ran . SAFE AND TOTAL LOVE WITH THE PERFECT PARTNER  --  GENDER APPROPRIATE . <p> I read the disclaimers . I gasped at the down payment . I sold everything I had on eBay and took all the money to do it . <p> I ordered a guy . <p> The De-con truck pulled up on the morning appointed . The assistant driver ran a forklift around and unloaded the crate . There were air holes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : DO NOT BEND . THIS SIDE UP . I saw it on the surveill TV . <p> The driver said through the intercom , " I got a questionable delivery . " <p> " No questions . I ordered it . " <p> " It wo n't fit in the De-con box . " <p> " You can set it down out there and leave . " Mother taught us to be cautious . " I 'll bring it in . " <p> " You should n't come out . " <p> " Okay , okay , " I said . " You can just open it and leave . " <p> " No way ? The crate 's been damaged . De-con guarantees protection and no way am I going to be liable . God knows what could have gotten inside . " <p> " I do n't care . " <p> " Lady , anything that happens to you comes out of my hide . I ca n't leave you alone with this thing . You could sue the company . " <p> " I 'll take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The De-con guy gestured to the assistant and they started to put the thing back on the truck . I armed the defense missiles and blew both of them away . <p> It took all the tools in the basement to blow the air lock and get the front door open but I finally managed . I pushed it aside and I came tottering out . Me , Dolly Meriwether , alone out in the world . It was weird ! The box was sitting right where the delivery men had left it . I thought I heard thumping . It seemed to bulge . <p> My guy . <p> There were air holes , all right , and there were plastic kibbles dribbling from one corner where the crate had smashed . There was also a warning label . MANUFACTURER NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGED GOODS OR CONTAGION INCURRED IN TRANSIT . <p> I put my mouth up to the hole . " Can you hear me ? Are you in there ? " <p> I thought I heard a voice . <p> Oh Mother , I was so excited ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , Dolly . That thing is full of germs ! " <p> " I do n't care ! " I opened the box with the crowbar . The sides fell away . Plastic kibbles cascaded down . He was standing there smiling in his orange coverall . " Hello . " <p> Mother hissed from beyond the grave . " Do n't touch that thing , you do n't know where it 's been ! " <p> My guy stepped out of the kibbles . He was nice and apologetic . " I 'm here on approval . Truth in advertising , I have to tell you this . If the seal on the box is broken , your product may be contaminated . You can return it and get your money back . " <p> I looked at the corner of the crate . " No problem , " I said . <p> " Look , " he said . " I was in a warehouse with a bunch of . Um . I 'm sorry , I might of caught something . " <p> " No problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him inside with me . " Kiss me , " I said . <p> " Even if I 'm . . . . ? " <p> I shut his mouth with my mouth and it was the best thing I ever tasted in this world . Then sirens started blatting and guns I did n't even know were in the walls around us slipped out of their slots  --  the automatic firing squad Mother had planted in the middle of some long-dead night . I heard a hundred clicks . The weapons arming . I heard her voice . " I TOLD YOU I 'D PROTECT YOU TO THE GRAVE . " <p> " I love you , " I yelled at him as a hundred triggers drew back . " Get out ! " <p> But I know it is too late for both of us . <p> <p> By Kit Reed <p>
