WHEN SUSAN SEES DANIEL ON TELEVISION , Wearing a brown suit and standing in front of a weather map of her state , the first thing she thinks is that you ca n't tell he 's short . Then she thinks of all the women in Tucson , eating dinner with their husbands and children , watching the news-and suddenly seeing him , gorgeous and smiling , pointing toward the high-pressure system over Yuma . " I have seen you naked , " she says to the television . She says it loud , but her husband , Craig , is in the shower and ca n't hear . She says it again . <p> Daniel seems new at this ; he keeps disappearing off the edge of the picture , so all you can see is an arm , gesturing . His hair , which used to straggle down to his collar , is short and shiny ; it looks viciously sprayed . But it looks good . He 's smiling as if he ca n't stop . He says the weather the next couple of days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the news anchors say welcome to Tucson , it 's good to have you with us . The woman anchor seems particularly happy . <p> Susan can hear Craig puttering about in the kitchen , and wonders if he might recognize Daniel , too . She only has one picture of him , in her college yearbook , and though she 'd pointed him out to Craig- " That was my science professor . Big dork " - he certainly would n't remember , would he ? Craig knows she dated an older man once , back in Pennsylvania when she was an undergrad . " Dated " was not a word she and Daniel ever used to describe what they did , but for Craig 's benefit that 's what she said . She did n't mention that he was her professor , the grinning goofball in the photograph , standing with his students at the quarry where he and Susan had made out . <p> " Hey , " Craig says , sitting down next to her on the sofa . He smells like pine-scented shower gel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? " His hair is damp , and she scratches her fingers through it . He leans onto her shoulder like a furry animal . <p> " Could we ? " she says . <p> The news ends , and the camera pans to everyone chatting around the desk . Susan feels a flash of electricity in her stomach , watching her lover on television while she rubs her husband 's neck . Ex-lover , she corrects in her head , but it sounds more exciting the other way ; it sounds better . <p> She 'd had to choose among chemistry , biology , and earth science . On the first day of geology class , Daniel said , " OK , I 'm still pretty new at this teaching stuff , but I know a lot about rocks . So bear with me and we 'll all learn something . " He must have been thirty then , but he looked younger , even with the wisps of gray in his black hair . He told everyone to call him Daniel , not Dr. Garrett . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , and he laughed and said he 'd answer to that , too . He sat balanced half on and half off the corner of his desk , like teachers on television . And he kept beaming his smiley brown eyes at Susan-she was n't imagining itl-until she felt herself blushing furiously , her head about to spin right off . <p> After that first class , Susan went back to her dorm room and danced by herself in dizzy circles . She wrote in her journal , in green felt-tip : 1 am stricken . Then changed it to smitten , then changed it back . <p> She did not tell anyone . It was as if , she told herself later , she knew this was n't just a crush , based on a fantasy that would never transpire . This was going to happen . When they did finally sleep together , the week before Thanksgiving , she woke up in his single bed with his arms twined around her , and wondered if it was possible to die from happiness , and wished she would . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building that has twisty , confusing hallways , like a giant Habitrail . She 's a secretary for a department called International Affairs , which sounds like it might involve travel and intrigue but only involves typing up forms so other people can have travel and intrigue , and then be reimbursed for it later . <p> Susan has her own office , tucked in the recesses of the fluorescent-lit suite , and Tina , the receptionist , sits out front . There are three other offices , occupied by Susan 's supervisor , Anna ; Anna 's nemesis , Byron ; and the kindly director , Dr. John Paul-whose name makes him sound French even though he 's not . Some people call him John and some call him Paul , and Susan calls him sir just to be on the safe side . Tina calls him Johnny , but only behind his back . <p> Tina is fourteen years older than Susan . She wears dresses that are both frumpy and too tight at once , and her blond frosted hair froths around her face like meringue . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a female impersonator , and Susan had to agree . Tina is from Dallas , and she 's always talking about how much better things were there . When Susan asked if she wanted to move back , Tina cocked her head and said , ominously , that there were certain people she did n't care to see again , ever . Susan supposed she meant her three ex-husbands , the fathers of her three children . <p> Tina 's youngest child is twelve , and Tina wants to work at the university until he 's college-age , for the tuition waiver . Susan had a tuition waiver while she was getting her master 's degree in psychology . Halfway through her program she realized she 'd rather be an archaeologist , but this is the sort of thing you 're supposed to realize earlier-when you 're fourteen-and so she went ahead with psychology . Now there 's nothing she can do unless she gets her Ph.D . or starts over , and she wants to leave Tucson forever and go someplace green and normal . Craig has two more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the " Spouse and Family " variety . <p> " I almost made a clean getaway , " Susan told Tina once . " And then he shows up and ruins everything . So I 'm stuck here for two more years , while he reaps the benefits of my benefits . " <p> She and Tina get in at 8:00 , and everybody else shows up between 8:30 and 9:00 . Susan opens her office , turns on her computer , and makes it look like she 's in the middle of something , then goes out and talks to Tina until people start arriving . <p> " Did you watch the news on channel 13 last night ? " Susan asks , and Tina says she ca n't remember , all her evenings blur together . " The new weather hunk is this guy I used to date in college . " <p> " What happened to whoosits ? The old guy they had before ? " " How should I know ? " Susan says . Tina irritates her , but it 's an enjoyable irritation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wanting to hang up but not being able to . <p> " I liked him , " Tina says , and looks vaguely into the distance as if summoning his image . <p> " This new weather guy was actually my professor . Sometimes he 'd come to student parties-he was that kind of person , really young and cute and funny-and one time I just got him wasted and took advantage . We ended up in this empty bedroom kissing . But it turned out we 'd liked each other all along , it was n't just the tequila . " <p> " Cool , " says Tina . <p> " We had this really intense , totally secret affair for about seven months . " <p> " Was he married ? " <p> " Oh , no . He said he 'd never get married , which was part of the appeal , you know . ' Cause there was a while when I was sure I 'd marry him . " Susan sighs . Tina is digging something out from under a purple nail with the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and divorced at nineteen , married and divorced two times since . Her oldest son is in jail for trying to steal a car , and her daughter is in Amsterdam trying to be a heroin addict . " Many is my last hope , " she has said , referring to her twelve-year-old . " My last hope for a normal kid . " She makes everything Susan has done seem like good clean fun , and so Susan tells her everything . She told her about shoplifting in college ( this was post-Daniel , and she only did it three times ) , and about not leaving a note when she dented somebody 's bumper in the Safeway parking lot , and about kissing Craig 's friend at a New Year 's Eve party . ( " We were locked in a bathroom together , it 's true , " she admitted , " but there was n't any tongue action . And I do n't even think the guy remembers it . " ) Once this information was filtered through Tina , it lost its guilt value ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I 'd like to see Daniel again , " Susan says now . " But without Craig knowing about it . " <p> " Call the station , " Tina says . " Say Hey , remember me ? " ' <p> Then Anna comes in , teetering on heels too small for her body , carrying a romance novel and briefcase . Susan retreats to her office and writes Tina e-mail . This is how they carry on most of their conversations , how Susan found out about Tina 's marriages and children , how she confessed about the shoplifting and the kissing . Every few months Tina sends a message asking if Susan wants to get together after work , go to happy hour , but Susan always declines . She prefers to keep their relationship confined to the perimeters of the office-or even better , to the perimeters of her computer screen . <p> " For a few minutes last night , " she writes , " I was watching Daniel on TV , and Craig was watching him , too , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who it was , of course . Do you think I should tell him or not ? " <p> She sends the mail and starts working on what she 's supposed to be doing , typing in a database of who traveled where , and why , and how much it cost the university . <p> " My job , " she tells Craig , " is like being hit with a hammer of boredom over and over until I 'm practically unconscious . " <p> " Find a different job , " he says . <p> " It would be the same or worse , " she tells him . " It would just be a different hammer . I wish I could be a full-time student . " <p> Craig is a full-time student , and he always complains about it , about the tests and the studying . And there are times , it 's true , when Susan is grateful for the mindless repetition of her job , when the familiarity of databases and three-part forms is soothing . She can let her mind wander ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Today , for instance , she types in seventeen travel vouchers while thinking about Daniel 's nearly hairless chest , his Old Spice smell , and his goldflecked eyes . <p> John Paul comes in , tan and smiley , effusing about his morning tennis game ; then Byron arrives-scowling , his gray-white hair sticking straight up-and goes straight to Anna 's office and shuts the door . This happens most mornings . Sometimes Susan can hear him yelling about which account is overdrawn , where did the money go , etcetera , etcetera . She has occasionally wondered if they ever had an affair ; also if Anna could be involved in some sort of embezzlement scheme . <p> Her computer beeps , and there 's a message reading " New Mail ! from Tina Loughten re Are You Crazy ? ? ? ? ? " Do n't even think about telling Craig , Tina has written . Because this way nobody gets hurt . It reminds Susan of a ransom note . <p> " The craziest thing I ever did for love , " Craig was saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into this girl 's window-fifth floor , right up the drainpipe . And then she was n't even home . " This was exactly one year ago , last September . Susan had graduated in May , but most of her friends were still in school , and she 'd come with them to the **25;1351;TOOLONG party . Craig was by the pool , in a circle of women Susan did n't recognize . She 'd been inside doing shots of tequila and was feeling pleasantly wobbly ; Craig , sitting there by the moonsplattered water , his big hands clasped around his knees , looked like somebody she ought to know . " You looked like a Greek statue , " she told him on their third date , knowing it sounded hokey but unable to stop herself . And she had n't even thought that when she saw him first ; she just thought he was handsome in a heart-stopping , tequila-blurred way . She liked that he 'd done crazy things for love . She had sat down beside him , feeling brave and confused . The girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so was he . <p> " I did that , too , " she said , leaning back until her elbows were smack against the cement . " I did n't crawl up a drainpipe or anything , but I broke into this guy 's house . I knew he was n't home , though . " She looked at Craig , not that she knew his name yet . She was thinking he looked almost fragile , with his black hair and sickly pale skin and long fingers . <p> " Then why 'd you break in ? " He seemed worried , like she was going to say she robbed the guy or killed his cat . <p> " So I could be lying in his bed naked when he came home , " she said , surprised at herself for saying this but somehow able to keep her voice even . She was pleased to see Craig 's eyes flicker . <p> This was not the whole truth , but she knew even then that it was the only truth he would ever get . <p> Daniel is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday through Friday . She watches them all , sometimes taping them to watch later . He 's learning not to wander off the screen , and to pronounce the Spanish names with a subtle accent . He also uses words like " smashing , " which he used to say when she knew him , and " treat , " - as in , " Tomorrow we 're in for a real treat , " meaning it would only get up to 100 degrees instead of 102 . He has five suits : two blue , two brown , one gray . <p> She will not , she knows , call the station and ask to talk to him , but she will see him eventually . She knows this the way she 'd known at the very beginning that they would be lovers . Even though they had n't actually used that word . <p> " How do you describe this relationship ? " she asked him once . <p> " Who would I describe it to ? " <p> " Yourself . " <p> " I do n't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " <p> " If you were to describe it to somebody else-your mother , say . " <p> " I 'd say , Mom , there 's this really cute student in my class , and sometimes we get together and have a great time . " ' <p> She thought about this . " But she could think you meant we go to Hershey Park or something . Or the zoo . That 's some people 's idea of a great time . " <p> " Well , I 'm glad we 're not those people . And , " he added , " I would never tell my mother about you anyway . " <p> He lived a block from campus in an apartment complex full of students and low-income families with three or four children each . He had a cat named Muffin he kept illegally , and the apartment smellednot of pee , exactly , but of the effort to cover up the smell of pee . Like rocks and mints and meadows . But that was also to cover up the smell of pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disapproved of Susan 's appreciation of tequila , claiming it killed brain cells . When they got stoned together , he 'd close the shades and insist that they smoke over the stove with the air vent going . He did this the first time she came to his apartment , the day after the party at which she 'd kissed him . He had n't invited her , but she knew where he lived , and she decided to stop by-she got slightly drunk first , then pointed herself in his direction and stalked over the campus , across the Turkey Hill parking lot , past the IGA , humming to herself the entire time as if trying to drown out the voice of her sober , saner self . <p> He seemed surprised but not unpleasantly so . <p> " I was just walking around , " she said , trying to sound casual . " And here I am . " <p> " Here you are , " he said . He was in his socks , and exactly her height . <p> He shut the blinds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ? - and then he took a Tupperware container from the freezer and disappeared into the bedroom and returned with a pipe . <p> " I was just about to indulge when you stopped by . Do you mind ? " " Not if you share , " she said . <p> Pot had never done much for her , but it was exciting to see him inhaling like a high-schooler , squinting his eyes and grinning goofily . <p> " Come stand over the stove , " he said . " I do n't want this place reeking if I can help it . " <p> His cat appeared from the bedroom , and he scooped her up and petted her , murmuring , " Hey Muffy-doodle , how 's my Muffy-doodle ? I have two forms of contraband in my apartment , " he said , lifting his head from the cat 's furry back . " One you smoke and one you cuddle . " <p> Susan stared at him , trying hard to think of something witty . Then the room started swaying under her feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I might puke . " <p> " Let 's get you some air . " Daniel disappeared quickly down the hall and emerged with a denim jacket . Susan understood that he wanted to be rid of her , wanted to shuttle her safely home so she would n't trip into traffic and have to tell the paramedics she 'd gotten stoned with her teacher . <p> The air was colder than it had been , and the sky was turning dusky . She was about to say , " I can make it home , " when she realized that instead of walking her toward the dorms , he seemed to be steering her toward the quarry . Was he going to show her rocks ? Was this a field trip , like the time the class went to the pond and identified shale ? The treeslate-September Pennsylvania trees-were turning gray , all fading against the sky . The ground smelled like mulch . She could hear the trickle of some distant stream , polishing and eroding . <p> " I love it here , " Daniel said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like dry leaves . <p> On Tuesdays Susan has lunch with Craig at a bar near campus called Gentle Ben 's . Tuesday is Craig 's free day-that 's what Susan calls it , but he insists he works as hard on Tuesday as the rest of the week . " But at least you do n't work in an office , " Susan persists . " There 's a difference . " Lately she 's begun to worry that her true self is starting to become apparent to him-her nervous , anxious self ; her frustrated , depressed , and jealous self . She and Craig have been married since July , ten months after they met . Everyone warned them it was too soon , but it seemed to her that if they could just get married before she started being insecure , or surly , or depressed , or any of those other things boyfriends had broken up with her for , then she would be preserved in a terrarium of happiness . Lately she 's been having dreams where Craig is packing all his things into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fooled ! You had me fooled ! " while she smokes cigarette after cigarette . <p> He does n't know she smokes , or that she cries in the shower in the morning . Or that , on nights when he has class and she comes home to an empty house , she will have a glass of red wine-she gave up tequila-and watch the 5:30 news , and the 6:00 , and the 10:00 from the night before . The good thing about taping is that she can fast-forward . <p> Her life has become something with hemispheres-the Craig hemisphere and the other , secret one ; and they rotate like a globe , falling in and out of shadow . <p> " So next year , " Craig is saying , stabbing enthusiastically at his romaine lettuce , " it looks like I 'm going to have a teaching assistantship . I 'm kind of stressed out about it . All that work , on top of everything else . " <p> Even his stress seems calm . He chews as if thinking about something in the future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know all about the id and the ego and how to tell if you 're bipolar or just moody . He looks up at Susan and swallows . " How 's work going ? " he asks tentatively , as if he does n't really want to know . <p> " Well , " Susan says , and pauses . He hates it when she complains , and she hates it when he tells her to get another job , as if stopping something that makes you miserable were just that easy . " It 's a barrel of monkeys like always , " she tells him . <p> " My husband is already sick of me , " Susan e-mails Tina . " What should I do ? " <p> In the office directly across from her , Anna is sighing and clicking her fingernails on her adding-machine keys . Anna has been working here longer than anybody else , nearly ten years . Susan knows , from seeing old paperwork , that Anna had started out as the receptionist and been promoted from position to position , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . <p> " If I 'm here in ten years , " Susan has told Tina , " promise you 'll shoot me . " <p> " If I 'm here in ten years it means Marty 's flunked out of college , so I 'll have already shot myself . " <p> They are both morbidly fascinated with Anna , and speculate about her personal life , what her husband is like ( they 've never seen him ) , whether her sick days are something more **27;1378;TOOLONG days ? job interviews ? trips to Vegas ? - whether she actually likes her job . <p> Sometimes Anna gets calls from her husband , and she closes the door and has hushed , urgent conversations , punctuated by occasional high-pitched giggles . When she opens the door she seems almost limp , smiling vaguely to herself . Tina once speculated that she was having phone sex , but Susan thinks it 's just mad , blind love . Anna got married two years ago-her second marriage-and sometimes Susan finds herself worrying about her , about what will happen when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan 's office . " Make him lasagna , " she says . " Men love that . " <p> Susan had been expecting advice about sex toys . Not that she would follow it . " Thanks , " she says . " That 's good to know . " <p> " What will you do , " she says to Craig one night , after the 6:00 news , " next semester when your female students get crushes on you and want to stay after class ? " <p> " And clap erasers ? " <p> " And try to get extra credit . " <p> " I 'll say , ' Why do n't you sit on my lap and tell me what you had in mind ? " ' <p> " No , really . Because they will . " <p> " No one 's going to get a crush on me , " Craig says . <p> " Well , " says Susan after a moment . " What if you get a crush on them ? " <p> " That 's nuts , " Craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says it , and she wonders if he 's considering the idea . Or considering considering it . <p> " Tina says I should make you lasagna , and that 'll solve all our problems . " Susan crawls over the sofa and sits on his lap , facing him , her legs on either side of his . <p> " What problems ? " he says . " Ow , you 're squashing me . " <p> " Fine , " she says , and climbs off . <p> With Daniel , Susan did not stay after class-in fact , she got out of there as soon as possible . She sat in the back and she did n't raise her hand and he did n't call on her . It was as if she were invisible , all quivering energy . <p> She was , however , fiercely jealous of the girls who did stay after class , especially the Dr. Dan one . <p> " You do n't like her , do you ? " she asked him one afternoon when they were sprawled on his sofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " But I 'm your best student . Right ? " <p> " You are my best student , the best I ever had . " <p> " How many students have you had ? " <p> " Cut that out , " he said . <p> She started stopping by his apartment at random times of the day and night . They 'd get stoned and curl up on the sofa with Muffin on top of them , flicking her tail . <p> " You do n't pop by unexpectedly because you 're hoping to catch me with someone else , do you ? " he finally asked . <p> " Of course not . " <p> " Because that would be awkward if you did , " he said , and she could n't bring herself to ask if he meant it would be awkward if she wanted to catch him , or awkward if she actually did , as if this were a possibility . She decided he meant the first one , but she started stopping by even more often . When he was n't home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muffin and looked through the stacks of papers on his desk and got the answers for the tests . He did n't know she did this , but she wanted to think he would n't mind . <p> Besides , it was hard to concentrate on anything enough to study . She started getting C 's in the classes where she had been getting B 's , and B 's where she had been getting A 's . Her roommate , a shy Japanese girl named Yuki , would ask if she was going to so-and-so 's party this weekend , or the soccer game . Susan always said no , she had plans , and began to feel as if she did n't belong there at all , in this dormitory with these litt ? e coeds . She wanted to move in with Daniel , but that was n't something she could just come out and ask , especially when she was n't sure-she was sure , but not totally sure-that he even loved her . " Muffin is my main squeeze , " he said once , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The light of my life . " Which struck Susan as unbelievably cruel , unless of course he did n't mean it , and was simply trying to tell her he was not immune to love . <p> She imagines scenarios for their eventual reunion : She 's in the mall and sees him in the food court , or at the Sunglasses Hut , or maybe even Macy 's . He wo n't realize how glad he is to see her until he actually does . <p> Or they could be biking on the Rillito River bike path , he going east and she west . He likes to bike ; she has a bike . She could use it . But this would be more difficult ; someone would have to flag down the other one , and she did n't want to do the flagging . <p> She might see him at Blockbuster Video , or in Safeway , or the Bagelry-he could be anywhere ! They might have driven past each other over and over , neither of them knowing . <p> Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Friday she worked eight to five and he worked five to ten thirty , but on weekends there was some other guy doing the forecast , so Daniel could be out doing anything , anywhere . <p> She 's looked him up in the phone book , but he is n't listed ; and one night when she was watching him do the 6:00 weather , she called information . There were three Daniel Garretts , and the first two were home . " Is this Daniel Garrett ? " she asked both in a low voice , staring at her Daniel on the television , and when they said yes , she hung up . On the third call a woman answered , and there seemed to be screaming children in the background , so that could n't be him , could it ? <p> When she sees him she 'll ask how he decided to become a weatherman , what that entailed . It does n't surprise her , really ; he 'd told her he 'd originally majored in communications , determined to be a newscaster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess I 'm a man of many talents , " he 'd said , completely serious . He 'd dropped out of college twice to travel around the country in a van , selling scissors-or , as he called them , shears . " You 'd be surprised how many hair salons will pay good money for a quality pair of shears . " He was always telling her he had no idea what he 'd be doing in five years , and he liked it that way . <p> If Craig met him , he 'd call Daniel a loser . Sometimes she thinks that if she could only get the two of them together , introduce them somehow , she would lose all interest in Daniel . Once , when she and Craig first started dating , they ran into her ex-boyfriend Van at El Charro . He was their waiter . He told them the specials were " mwa ! " and kissed his fingers . <p> " Mwa ! " Craig kept saying on the way home . " Mwai You dated a guy who says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling Van up , just to chat , but now she knew she never would . <p> When she finally does see Daniel , she 'll tell him she 's happily married , that she has her masters and is going to get her Ph.D . in archaeology . She 'll say she 's never been happier . <p> And if he wants to get together sometime ? <p> Well , she thinks . He had better . <p> Being at work is like being a child in a house of slamming doors where Mommy and Daddy are always fighting and it 's impossible to know whose side to be on . <p> " We 're the neglected children , " she e-mails Tina , " and Anna 's the hypersensitive mother , Byron 's the overbearing father . John Paul is the kindly uncle who has no clue what 's actually going on but just wants everybody to like him . " <p> " I think I would be the visiting cousin , " Tina e-mails back . " And you would be the adopted daughter who never really fits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks she does n't fit in . <p> One day , while Susan is in the midst of actually doing her work , Byron stomps into Anna 's office and closes the door . But then the door opens immediately-Anna 's ordering Byron out ! - and Anna herself stalks out and goes into John Paul 's office and slams his door . After about an hour , she gets her coat and purse and goes home . <p> The next day Byron comes into Susan 's office and-thank Goddoes n't close her door , but sits down on her blue chair , moving her purse and sweater onto the floor without even asking , and tells her Anna has quit . <p> Divorce , Susan thinks . <p> Byron is leaning forward nervously , wringing his hands . He bows his head briefly , and Susan can see sunburned scalp beneath his pale hair . She has no idea how old he is . He looks up and stares past her . " Nice poster , " he says , referring to the Antarctic landscape above her desk . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , " she says . " That was here when I got here . " <p> Byron nods , as if thinking this over . Susan has never had a problem with him-he 's always nice enough , stops by to chitchat when Anna 's not in her office . He 's not a bad person , she thinks , but the fact that he drove Anna away seems enough to make her dislike him intensely . And she dislikes him even more intensely when he tells her-kindly , slowly , as if she were a skittish animal that might run or bite-that she 's going to have to work with him on some things until they get everything sorted out , until they find a new Anna . <p> " Uh-huh , " Susan says , and wonders how long it would take to find another job if she quit right now , just got up and walked out like Anna did . But she knows she wo n't . And then , as she knew and feared would happen , John Paul calls her into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , thank you , " she says , and tries not to think of the moneyAnna made a lot of money , who knew ? - and then she goes down to the restroom and throws up . <p> " I need adventurer " she says to Craig that evening . " I 'm going to work in an office for the rest of my miserable life . " <p> Craig thinks she should take the job . " It 'll be more interesting , " he says . <p> " Same hammer , but bigger . A sledgehammer . " <p> Craig sighs . " Obviously they like you and think you 're good at what you do . " <p> " That 's just it ! " she cries . " I do n't want to be good at what I do . I want to be good at something else . Something I should be doing . " <p> " We ca n't always do what we want for a living , " he says , in the same sort of voice Byron used when he told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do things we do n't like . It 's life . " <p> " That 's so stupid , " she says , and feels abashed , unable to come up with anything more compelling , any actual evidence that he 's wrongwhich he certainly is , he has to be . <p> " Being a weatherman in this town has got to be the easiest job in the world , " Tina says one morning in early November . " Sunny and warm , sunny and warm , and for the extended weekend forecast-sunny and warm ! " <p> " It does rain here , " Susan says . " It rained last week ! " <p> " Oh , that was n't rain . You want to see rain , go to Dallas . " <p> " Why do n't you go to Dallas , " Susan says nastily , and then regrets it when Tina withers in her chair . " I 'm sorry , " Susan says quickly . " I 'm just stressed and depressed . " <p> " Well do n't take it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts typing ferociously . <p> It 's been three weeks since Anna quit , and they still have n't been able to find someone to replace her . This is complicated by the fact that Anna was the only one who knew how to process the hiring paperwork , or even how to find it . <p> Craig has been studying for finals though they 're almost a month away . Evenings he goes into the bedroom and shuts the door , comes out occasionally for soup or cheese . Finally he starts going to a coffee shop after he gets home , and then he stops coming home until late . She 'll go to sleep after the news , and when she wakes up for work he 's snoring on the other side of the bed . <p> " This is just temporary , " he tells her . <p> " Everything 's temporary , " she says . She does n't think she means it in a good way . <p> Susan watches the news by herself , drinks Bloody Marys and screwdrivers . Tina 's wrong-it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been two major thunderstorms-one with flooding1-in the past couple of months , and Daniel predicted them both , beautifully . " Whatever you do , " he cautioned , sternly handsome , " do not try to drive through a flooded wash , or even a dip in the road . The water can be deceptively , and dangerously , deep . " He stared at the camera with the same intense , sensitive look she 'd seen on his face as he dumped her . Tried to dump her . <p> It seems she should have run into him by now . But on weekends she 's too exhausted to do anything ; it 's all she can do to drag herself to Safeway . And Blockbuster , so she can lie on the sofa and watch movies while Craig is off studying whatever 's so important . Susan never studied , and she did fine ; she does n't recall Craig studying like this last semester , but they were n't married then , were n't even living together yet . This seems truly shocking for the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had three haircuts , one pap smear , been to the dentist once , had her oil changed twice . Love , she thinks , makes time seem bigger , puffs it up like cotton candy . Squash it down and there 's nothing there . Ten months . <p> Ten months ago she was n't so exhausted all the time , either ; she was n't being groomed as the next Anna . Not that they 've told her this , but she can tell . Byron and John Paul have been telling her to " utilize " any of Anna 's disks and files , encouraging her to take classes on how to make complicated spreadsheets . <p> " I really do n't want Anna 's position , " she has told them , and Byron said no , of course not , and John Paul gave her a beneficent , condescending smile , as if she was too stupid to know what was good for her . <p> " Hell , if you do n't take it , maybe 1 will , " Tina said once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Susan highly doubts this , but still , the idea of working for Tina is disturbing . <p> " Maybe , " she says to Craig , " I 'll just quit altogether , get a job at Albertson 's or something . You could kiss your tuition waiver good-bye . " <p> " If that 's what you really want , " he says , but he does n't sound convinced . Lately he 's been looking at her as if she 's a wild animal that might suddenly chew through its cage and tear his leg off . <p> Craig still thinks Anna 's job would be good for her . " More challenging , " he says . And for the first time Susan considers the possibility that she could do it-for the money , for a year-if the rest of her life were bearable . <p> It 's not as if she has n't had opportunities to see Daniel . There are events in which the TV station participates-Carve a Pumpkin for Charity , then the Turkey Stuff-Off in the Tucson Mall . She knows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he biked in El Tour de Tucson . " Twenty-five miles ! " he said , then addressed the camera : " But it was for a good cause . " <p> She makes a deal with herself that if she has n't seen him by December she will seek him out . And when , at the end of a broadcast on December 10 , the female anchor says they will all be at the Winter Street Fair next weekend , selling falafel for charity , Susan feels as if her heart has been plucked out of her chest and flung across the room . Craig will be finished with his finals ; right now he 's at the library , where he 's been staying until all hours lately . <p> She calls Craig 's best friend Barry in Santa Fe and tells him Craig would love to see him , he 's been stressed out lately because of school , he needs to get away for a few days . The next day she says to Craig , " Why do n't you go see Barry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs and omens and possibilities . Susan feels her life teetering , and waits for it to tilt one way or the other , for the globe to spin faster or fall out of the sky . <p> " That 's a good idea , " Craig says quietly , not looking at her . <p> It 's as if he 's been brainwashed , as if she 's made some sort of wish and does n't know exactly what it is , except that it 's going to come true . <p> " The craziest thing I ever did for love , " Susan e-mails Tina , " was go to Daniel the weatherman 's apartment and try to kill myself . Or at least I wanted him to think that 's what I was doing-I would n't have *really* done it . But he was making me so miserable , you know ? So I just broke in one day through a window and I was on the bathroom floor when he comes in and orders me out ! What a jerk ! I want to see him again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause success is the best revenge , am I right ? " <p> Her plan had been to overdose and have him find her in his bed . Now , of course , it seems ridiculous and soap opera-y , the things she 'd been thinking : He would cradle her in his arms , call the ambulance , sit by her hospital bedside , holding her hand . He would tell his mother all about her . He would apologize for calling her young and flighty . " We 're completely ill-suited for each other , " he had told her the day before . " And I do n't want to risk getting either of us in trouble . " Then he 'd told her she was young and flighty , but he 'd said it as if it was not so much a bad thing as a verifiable fact , like being Swedish . <p> All he had in his medicine cabinet was aspirin , Pepto-Bismol , and vitamin E. When he came back from class she was still crouched on the floor ; trying to figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything at all . Muffin was rubbing her head under Susan 's elbow . <p> " You are fucked up , " Daniel said , standing in the bathroom doorway . " I 'm sorry , but you are . I ca n't help you . " Then he disappeared down the hall , and Muffin trotted after him . Susan swallowed two Tylenol , crying without even meaning to , then leaned against the wall and cried even harder . Daniel came back a minute later and said , " Go home , would you ? " <p> The rest of the semester they avoided each other . Susan started sleeping with a soccer player whom she did not love and who did not think she was fucked up . She told the girls on her hall about her affair , but after she dished out all the details they lost interest . She told her roommate Yuki about her plan to overdose , and Yuki regarded her with confusion and pity and said , " I 'm glad you did n't do it . " The next day the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her-was she OK ? Was she thinking of hurting herself ? <p> " I 'm fine , " Susan said , and wished she had never told anybody anything . <p> After Susan sends her confessional e-mail to Tina , she realizes she 's shaking . She starts working on some of Anna 's old accounts-it 's actually quite easy , she does n't know why Anna was so bent out of shape all the time-waiting for her computer to beep . Waiting for a message from Tina saying , " Oh , that 's nothing , I did that sort of thing back in Dallas all the time . You wan na do happy hour after work ? " <p> And she would want to , Susan realizes . After about fifteen minutes Susan steps out of her office . Tina 's not at her desk . <p> " Byron ? " she says , rapping softly on his half-closed door . " Do you know where Tina is ? " <p> " She just went home sick . Said she was about to puke , so I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Susan , and retreats to her office . She thinks about her e-mail floating around , like some poison-filled balloon . Did Tina read it before she went home ? Or has she not gotten it yet ? Susan wishes she 'd never sent it . <p> Tina is out the next day and the day after , and when she comes back the only message Susan gets relates to the vivid specifics of Tina 's illness . " I 'm washing my hands twenty times a day from now on , " Tina writes . " ' Cause I spent the last three days on the toilet , if you know what I mean . " <p> What happened to the e-mail Susan sent ? Was it lost ? Had it found its way to the wrong computer , and now someone in the bursar 's office or the English department was reading about her college stupidity ? <p> Or perhaps what she confessed was just so dumb , so terrible and ridiculous , that Tina did n't think it was even worth replying to . On Friday-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds Daniel again-Susan leaves work a half-hour early to drive Craig to the airport . " I 'll miss you , " he says , as if it 's a question . <p> " Have fun , " she tells him , and allows herself to be kissed at the curb . She goes home to her empty house and drinks a glass of red wine , then another , and wonders if she will bring Daniel here , or if she 'll go to his place . She would prefer his place . It occurs to her that she does not want him to know where she lives-not that he 'd be dropping over , but what if he did ? One night when Craig was at school ; or worse , when he was n't . <p> She drinks another glass of wine and suddenly wants to phone someone-not her mother , who would know right away she 's drunk ; not her friend Helen in Philadelphia , because it 's too late there . Most of her friends from grad school have moved away , and the ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . At first they 'd call and ask if she wanted to go to a movie , or to dinner , but she would be too tired after work , and there was too much to do on weekends , and finally they stopped calling . <p> After another glass of wine-can the bottle be that close to empty ? Susan realizes that the person she wants to talk to is Tina . She finds her number in the phone book and dials it slowly , wondering if she might start crying as soon as Tina answers . What will she say ? She 'll invite her over-she knows this in a flash of relief , and desperation-she 'll tell her to bring a bottle of wine , and they 'll stay up all night talking . She 'll find out if Tina ever got that e-mail , and she 'll ask what Tina thinks of her plan to see Daniel at the street fair . <p> The phone , she realizes , has been ringing for what seems like a long , long time . Then she remembers Tina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of various men calling up and leaving drunken , lovesick messages . <p> Susan lets the phone ring another twenty times and then hangs up . <p> The first few years Susan lived in Tucson , she went to both street fairs , winter and spring . They 're always the same , over and over-the giant chair ; the Uruguyan musicians in white frocks , playing songs of the Andes ; the hemp jewelry ; the palm readers who will tell you ( at least , one told her ) you 'll be married within six months and living in a Victorian house on the Oregon coast . <p> It 's the same temperature whether it 's December or April ; the only difference is that now there are Christmas decorations , booths with ornament displays . The giant chair is wrapped in a giant red ribbon . <p> Susan allows herself to be swept into the flow of people heading down Fourth Avenue , into the air that smells like pizza and incense . It 's impossible to tell if Daniel might be up ahead , or if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's nothing to do but keep walking until she finds him . <p> She 's wearing high-heeled boots and a black leather jacket-Craig'sand she feels brave and dangerous . She also feels conspicuous-a woman about to cheat-and tries to pretend that this is not what she 's doing . She 's Christmas-shopping , she 's meeting friends , she 's visiting from out of town , from someplace cold . By the time she gets to the end of the street and is being borne up the other side , she feels completely , blessedly invisible . Until she sees Daniel-not at any falafel booth , but walking quickly toward her-and then all she feels is afraid . <p> She had n't considered the possibility that she might see him and want only to run away . Or that , when he looked right into her eyes , his face would go dark , his mouth would tighten , and he would keep walking , not slowing down at all . <p> Maybe , she thinks , just maybe , he did n't recognize her . <p> Ahead there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd corrected Craig last year , feeling worldly ) , and she goes inside . It 's as she remembered it : quiet , dim , cool as a cave and nearly empty . Last year , she and Craig had ducked in looking for a bathroom and ended up staying for hours . Why had she sent him away ? She understands , too late , that he should be here with her , to say things like , " That weather guy is much shorter and dorkier in person , " or even , " Was I imagining it , or does he hate your guts ? " Right now , up in Santa Fe , he and Barry-who 's still single , what was she thinking ? - are probably drinking beer and flirting with tanned tourists , and Craig is telling anyone who will listen that the craziest thing he ever did for love was marry someone who does n't even exist . <p> At the pay phone by the bathroom , she dials Tina 's number , which she 's memorized without meaning to . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hi . Marty ? " Susan is aware that she 's trembling ; the phone feels cold against her ear . " I 'm a friend of your mom 's . Is she home ? " <p> " No , " says the boy . " She 's at the mall . " In the background , she can hear the television going . <p> " OK , listen carefully . Tell her Susan is at Jaime 's and to come down as soon as possible . OK ? Have you got it ? " <p> " Yeah , " says the boy , and hangs up . <p> Susan sits at the bar and orders a shot of tequila , the good kind , the kind she used to drink while Daniel was blowing pot into the fan above the stove . " Disgusting , " he would say , his eyes stoned little slits . <p> Last April , she and Craig had sat at a table by the window and played Describe Your Ideal Lover . She described someone exactly like Craig , and he described someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Someone at ease with herself , " he said . " And confident and sexy , who knows where she 's going in life . Who 's happy . " <p> " What about stacked ? " said Susan , looking down at herself . <p> " You 're perfect . " Craig blushed into his beer . <p> " Tell me , " she said , leaning toward him , confident , sexy , happy , " about this woman whose window you crawled into . You must have been madly in love with her . " <p> " Oh , I was mad , all right . Then she got mad , and then we broke up . That 's simplifying it a little . " <p> " Well , " she said , and looked at him . " If you crawled into my window , I would n't be mad . " <p> " I do n't do that sort of thing anymore , luckily . " He sighed , took a drink of his beer , set the glass down with a decisive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew right then he would marry her . Susan had known it , too . It was one of those moments when everything seems inevitable , when your life seems to tip forward and you 're suddenly , briefly , inhabiting your own future . <p> Susan twists around on her stool and watches people moving past the windows , like glowing shadows . What if Tina never comes ? Is anything inevitable now , anything at all ? She 's aware of a familiar powerless feeling-and she thinks she had better just wait here , until she knows for sure whether she wants to ward it off , or welcome it , or just confuse it long enough to get away . <p>
