1 . Random Acts of Rudeness // As the twenty-first century dawned , most people were feeling fed up . A public opinion poll in 2001 reported that 80 percent of Americans believed the constant coarseness , disrespect , and lack of consideration they encountered in society was such a " serious , pervasive problem " that it affected them " on a personal , gut level " and had grown into " a daily assault on their sensibilities and the quality of their lives . " At the same time , it seemed people did n't believe they had much power to change things , so they simply resigned themselves to all the insidious incivility they encountered . // The Pew Charitable Trusts sponsored the poll , called " Aggravating Circumstances : A Status Report on Rudeness in America . " Public Agenda , a national policy research group , conducted it . And in their introduction , the authors made sure to justify their examination of how we get along with each other in public every day : " At first , it might seem that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or important than exploring citizens ' views on , say , health care or education or retirement policy . Yet how people treat each other in their daily interactions  --  whether they take steps to be respectful of one another , whether they are willing to moderate their own desires and comfort to accommodate the needs of others  --  seems to us to be profoundly important and indeed central to the definition of a ' civilized ' society . " // The report immediately zeroed in on one area of society that most respondents agreed offers perhaps the ripest examples of rude and infuriating public behavior . " Americans say that the way they are treated by business and customer service employees is frequently exasperating , and sometimes even insulting . " One particular customer service channel came under the heaviest fire . " When it goes wrong , perhaps nothing embodies greater exasperation than customer service by phone . " // According to the survey , 67 percent of Americans sometimes have to " make a fuss to get a problem resolved . " And nearly everyone  --  94 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get a recording instead of a human being . " And even if callers do finally speak to a live customer service agent , the irritation does n't always end . In a Florida focus group , one man said , " Half the time they have no idea what they 're talking about . And they do n't care . They 'll tell you anything just to get you off the phone . " // To be fair , the report also notes that " it seems the rudeness cuts both ways . Disgruntled customers bring frayed nerves , previous frustrations and their own personal shortcomings when they deal with those responsible for helping them . " A Connecticut customer service representative told her focus group , " They think you 're at their beck and call . They may want something , and they 're not getting it as rapidly as they think they should . I answer the phone , and they just immediately go off on me. " // It probably does n't take a scientifically conducted public opinion poll to find evidence of the contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony about the effects of that kind of antipathy in their lives . Merely bringing up the subject at any gathering will generate at least one horror story from just about everyone . But in the years since that survey officially highlighted and validated the displeasure bubbling just under the surface of our everyday dealings with customer service , a few of those tensions have boiled over in very public ways . The news media , in tandem with various Web sites , have played increasingly larger roles in amplifying them . Just ask Comcast , for example . // Trouble for the nation 's largest cable television and broadband provider started in earnest with the story of LaChania Govan , a mother of two in her mid-twenties who inadvertently became a public symbol of mistreated customers everywhere . Govan lives in suburban Chicago . She goes to work all week and attends church every Sunday . She has a pleasant and welcoming voice . She also has a strong sense of fairness . // In July 2005 , Govan 's digital video recorder would n't work . She called Comcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . During the course of four weeks , she called more than forty times . She was repeatedly disconnected , put on hold , or transferred to inept or inert representatives and technicians . One customer service representative transferred her to the Spanish-speaking line . Govan knows only English . She just wanted someone to resolve her seemingly simple case . // She says she never raised her voice , but she was resolute . " Calling Comcast became my second job , " Govan said . " I had to ensure the cordless phone was fully charged and the kids were content . And I sat and called . I cooked and called . I cleaned and called , and just called . " Almost every day , Govan prodded the big company 's customer service department as best she could . Finally , she found a rep who heard her out and took her case in hand . A technician was sent to replace her cable box at no charge , and she was credited with a free month of service . Govan 's perseverance paid off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's August cable bill arrived . Her name did not appear on the bill . Instead it was addressed to " Bitch Dog . " Someone at Comcast had changed her account name . Govan said , " I was so mad I could n't even cuss . " // Instead of becoming just another unnoticed casualty in the adversarial relationship between many companies and their customers , Govan went public . The Chicago Tribune ran her story . Within days , the mainstream news media , bloggers , and consumer advocates from everywhere were spreading her tale of woe . She appeared as the number-one story on MSNBC 's Countdown with Keith Olbermann . A Comcast executive left an apology on Govan 's home voice mail . The company claimed it identified and fired two employees responsible for changing the name on Govan 's bill . She was offered all sorts of free service , which she refused . She wanted nothing more to do with Comcast. // Govan , who also happens to be a customer service representative for a major credit card company , is studying criminal justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eventually , she says , she hopes to become a judge . Her inherent sense of justice is what drove her to persevere . So she was speaking with conviction when she told the Washington Post that she believes customer service means " being friendly , helpful and respectful . I know how it feels to be a customer service rep and a consumer on the other end . You do not have to settle for less , and you do not have to be mistreated. " // In 2006 , Comcast was dealing with another public display of customer service missteps . A subscriber in the Washington , D.C. , area found the technician that Comcast sent to fix his cable system had fallen asleep on his couch . The worker was kept on hold for so long by his own company when he called for help that he dozed off . The customer shot video of the napping technician and posted it on the Internet , where it went viral . Comcast issued another apology , and again said the worker in question had been fired . // Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst embarrassment to date when seventy-six-year-old Mona Shaw took her outrage with its customer service a few steps further than any disgruntled customer had done before . As she has told the story , it started when a technician scheduled to come out to her suburban Washington , D.C. , home on a Monday did n't show up . Comcast was supposed to install what it calls its triple-play service , which included the company 's new telephone service , along with its traditional Internet and cable television connection , all for under $100 per month . Shaw , a retired military nurse and secretary of her local AARP , as well as a square dancer who fosters stray dogs until they can be adopted , waited all day Monday . When Comcast finally arrived two days later , the technician left the job half done and never came back . On Friday , the company cut off what service Mona and her husband , Don , still had . // Without phone service , the Shaws could n't call to get help , so they drove over to their local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manager and were told to wait , outside , in the August heat . They say they sat on a bench for two hours , until the same woman who had asked them to wait leaned out the door , told them the manager had gone home for the day , and thanked them for coming . Shaw told the Washington Post , " They thought just because we 're old enough to get Social Security that we lack both brains and backbone . " // By Monday , after a weekend with no phone , TV , or Internet , Shaw was so angry that she took matters into her own hands , literally . She got her husband 's hammer , and they went back to the local Comcast office . This is how Washington Post reporter Neely Tucker described Shaw 's account of what happened next : // Hammer time : Shaw storms into the company 's office . BAM ! She whacks the keyboard of the customer service rep . BAM ! Down goes the monitor . BAM ! She totals the telephone . People scatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? POW ! A parting shot to the phone ! // " They cuffed me right then , " she says . // Her take on Comcast : " What a bunch of sub-moronic imbeciles . " // Being a responsible newspaper , we must note that this is a misdemeanor , a crime , a completely inappropriate way of handling a business dispute . // Noted . // Who among us has not longed for a hammer in this age of incompetent " customer service representatives , " of nimrods reading from a script at some 800-number location , of crumbs-in-their-beards plumbing installation people who tell you they 'll grace you with their presence between 12 and 3 , only never to show ? And you 'll call and call and finally some outsourced representative slings a dart at a calendar and tells you another guy will come back between 10 and 2 next Thursday ? And when this guy comes , pants halfway down his behind , he 'll tell you he brought the wrong part ? // And there is nothing , nothing you can do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hammer Woman , avenger of oppressed cable subscribers everywhere ! ( Cue galloping " Lone Ranger " theme. ) // " It had never occurred to me to take a hammer to a phone company before , but I was just so upset , " Mona Shaw told the paper . " After I hit the keyboard , I turned to this blond who had been there the previous Friday , the one who told me to wait for the manager , and I said , ' Now do I have your attention ? ' " Shaw , who has a heart condition , said during the incident her blood pressure rose and she started hyperventilating . In addition to calling the police , someone called an ambulance . By the end , she was fined $345 and given a three-month suspended sentence for disorderly conduct , as well as a one-year restraining order prohibiting her from going anywhere near the Manassas Comcast office . // For months afterward , Shaw was a television and Internet celebrity of sorts , appearing on Good Morning America , Nightline , and Dr. Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site , and she was hailed as a folk hero on numerous blogs , as well as on ComcastMustDie.com. // That Web site was initiated in fall 2007 , two months after Shaw 's Comcast encounter , by Bob Garfield , Advertising Age columnist , author , and cohost of National Public Radio 's On the Media , who had his own customer service dust-up with Comcast . Garfield describes the ComcastMustDie mission on his site 's home page : " Actually , I have no death wish for Comcast , or any other gigantic , blundering , greedy , arrogant corporate monstrosity . What I do have is the earnest desire for such companies to change their ways . This site offers an opportunity  --  for you to vent your grievances ( civilly , please ) and for Comcast to pay close attention . " // In conversation , it is n't hard to get Garfield to air some of his own frustration . " I do n't know about anybody else , but already , as I 'm dialing 1-800-COMCAST , my blood pressure is 180/140 , because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start on an even keel , but my worst fears are realized within the first few minutes . And then , you ca n't really sob on the phone  --  that 's unmanly . But I 've tried everything else . I 've tried begging , I 've tried reasoning , I 've tried threatening . I 've tried it all . Nothing works . You just hope the gods align on your side . // " I 've had real tragedy in my life  --  really painful stuff , the stuff of real life . But I have never been as close to blowing an aneurysm as I was on the phone with Comcast . It is just so frustrating and so infuriating  --  the combination of rage and the sense of absolute impotence . It 's not a happy feeling . It gets back to the golden rule . You would never treat somebody this way yourself . It 's against everything we 've ever learned , from the time we were ambulatory . The experience we have is antithetical to everything that we ever have been told about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // Garfield believes Comcast and other companies ignore a changing business landscape at their own peril , a landscape in which the Internet is giving new power to customers . " Now we can aggregate to have our voices heard and to put pressure on these people . Customer service and customer relations management is going to be so critical to all corporate futures . Marketing , as we have known it , is all about customer relations in the future . I mean , forget advertising . It is over . We are seeing the last dregs of advertising being the prime marketing tool . It 's going to be all about cultivating , exploiting , and collaborating with consumers . And you ca n't do that if they hate you . " // Hundreds of customers posted their complaints on ComcastMustDie right away . Many then reported online about getting a personal call from a Comcast customer service worker who was monitoring the site and made sure to solve their problems . Garfield was happy with that but thought the company should go further . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploiting , collaborating . And they have to create a technical infrastructure , and also empower employees to deal with customer complaints in a logical , honest , straightforward manner . They are very far from being there . " // On the site , Garfield laid out three main demands to Comcast . First , he asked the company to recruit a " panel of customers to consult , brainstorm , complain and advise you every step of the way . " Second , he asked for a Web site where customers can post feedback " of every kind . " And finally , " most importantly of all , you must recognize that none of this is a PR move you have to make through gritted teeth . It is a golden opportunity to exploit the unprecedented potential of a connected world . " // Garfield pointed out that ever since the founding of Comcast in Tupelo , Mississippi , in the 1960s , it has been laying the wiring for what has become the Internet . " Yet you do n't even realize you have created the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At this moment it must seem like Frankenstein 's monster , but take our word for it : It 's Comcastic , " he wrote , using the company 's own advertising slogan to mock it . // While all this public turmoil was taking place on the customer side of Comcast , the shareholders were getting restless and squeezing the company from their end as well . Heretofore in the cable television and broadband Internet industry , only one of a handful of companies provided service in any local market . But those local monopolies started to face serious competition from the dominant national players in the telecommunications industry , such as Verizon and AT&amp;T . Those companies began offering broadband Internet access and television just as Comcast was breaking into the telephone business . Comcast lost some customers , but it also poached some from its new competitors . By the end of 2007 , apparently due to pessimism about the company 's ability to compete , share prices for Comcast had fallen 35 percent despite the fact that revenues were up and the company was still profitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major Las Vegas consumer electronics show , Brian Roberts , Comcast 's CEO and the son of the company 's retired octogenarian founder , said Comcast 's " customer service has got to continue to reach new levels of excellence . " // A few days later , a high-level conflict that had been brewing for months came to a head when a major institutional investor in Comcast , Glenn Greenberg of Chieftain Capital Management , wrote a scathing letter to the board calling for the ouster of Roberts . Greenberg , son of baseball great Hank Greenberg , noted the falling stock prices and called the management of the company a " comcastrophe . " As examples , he pointed to slow response to competition ; large management bonuses ; a multimillion-dollar , five-year death benefit for Roberts 's father ; and what he saw as too much emphasis on acquiring other companies while ignoring investors . // In a blog for BusinessWeek magazine a few days after the letter , reporter Jena McGregor spoke about the customers who were feeling ignored as well . She asked if " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part , by its customers ' widely aired complaints about its customer service . " McGregor said , " One need look no further than blogs " like ComcastMustDie and others to " find evidence that Comcast is the frequent target of unbridled consumer ire . Which makes me wonder : When will investors focus on customer service as an issue they should address ? " // By Valentine 's Day 2008 , Comcast was making moves to stem some of the most immediate shareholder criticism . They did away with the founder 's death benefit , reduced executive bonuses , and announced that they would reinstate a shareholder dividend they had not paid since 1999 . Roberts assured investors that rumored plans to acquire Sprint or Yahoo were untrue . At least temporarily , stock prices rallied , and an investor uprising was quelled . // But a Fortune.com news brief about the Comcast shareholder initiatives garnered some representative public comments that again highlighted the company 's customer problems . One Fortune reader said , " Returning profits to their shareholders is good , in the short term , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improving their extremely poor customer service . " Another Fortune reader said , " This week my wife and I have talked to a total of 9 individuals at their customer service center , including 4 supervisors , and they have yet to resolve our current issue . Unfortunately I 'm starting to see that horrible customer service is actually the norm these days in EVERY industry here in the states . As a people we have no desire to properly serve others . " // Rick Germano , the senior vice president of customer operations for Comcast , was charged with the huge responsibility of taking on these issues . By early 2008 , he had begun a listening tour of Comcast cities . In an open letter to customers on Comcast 's Web site , he announced the company 's new commitment to customer service . " We are putting a tremendous amount of resources into making it easier for you to do business with us . This is part of a company-wide effort to improve service that will continue for several years . " He then listed some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new customer service agents and technicians in the two previous years , opening six more call centers , weekend appointments for service so it is more convenient for customers , and shorter windows for appointment times so that customers are n't spending entire days waiting for service . // Germano is humble , and surprisingly frank , when discussing his new role . " I would look like a corporate suit , " he says , " trying to bury a problem if I said we have no problems . We do have problems . " He has been at Comcast since 1986 , first in the corporate office in Philadelphia and then managing the West Coast region . In that time , he has seen the company grow and evolve as it expanded from cable television into new markets and industries , such as providing high speed Internet and , now , telephone service . " Telecommunications has become quite competitive , and that 's new for us . Cable was a monopoly for all intents and purposes up until very recently . If you do n't have any competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really are n't going to leave you . They 're beholden to you . // " Now they have a lot of choices . And we went from not being in the phone business , to being the fourth largest telephone company in the United States in less than three years . And I think we took our eye off of the customer service ball . There were other , more important priorities , like rapid growth , product innovation , integration of acquired properties . We grew way too quickly , and now customer service is playing catch-up . We were n't always big . When I first started , we were tiny , and nobody cared what we did . So I think , in some cases , we 're a victim of our own success . But the critical piece is : How do we handle it moving forward ? // " Now we 're going up against some of the largest corporations on Earth . And it 's fascinating to me to watch AT&amp;T and Verizon , two very large , well-respected corporations , get into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like we 're learning the hard way in the telephone business . And customer service is a key differentiator . It has become much more important . So we have to go back and fix customer service , and it has to be sooner rather than later . " // Germano says to do that , the company will continue to adjust to its new competitive landscape , where fast change is inevitable and where employing the tools of the marketplace to keep their corporate eyes and ears open is key . " Customers have higher expectations . They want what they want , and they want it now . Companies have to listen , they have to understand  --  particularly larger companies . Social networking and blogs are very , very powerful . One unhappy customer , in any company , can become a national sensation in less than twenty-four hours . In our case , we 've had a couple . And our reputation has been harmed . I think we accept that fact . A company ca n't hide its problems anymore . But now we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our customers , listen to our employees , and say , ' Okay , what do we need to do to get our reputation back ? ' " * // When Claes Fornell enlisted for mandatory military service in his native country , Sweden , during the late 1960s , he was given aptitude tests to determine the job for which he would be best suited . " Apparently , I tested well for putting patterns together that nobody else can see . " He was sent to work in cryptology , or code breaking . " I started trying to figure out what was crawling under the surface of the Baltic Sea . We had some very murky pictures from the bottom of the sea . " They also had sonar readings that indicated something was there . But nothing was self-evident . By making connections between the incomplete measures and other data they had , Fornell and his colleagues were able to come up with a plausible theory , even if they never found a conclusive answer . " We figured out there was a strong likelihood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well after his Swedish soldier days , Fornell would go on to develop his skill at determining " what something is even though I ca n't see it " as a professor of business at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor . And now , instead of trying to pinpoint suspected Soviet subs , he has turned his expertise toward measurement of a less subversive but equally elusive enigma : how well companies are doing at keeping their customers happy . Fornell is the founder of the American Customer Satisfaction Index , the ACSI , which is now considered a national standard in the United States . Through 65,000 customer interviews each year , Fornell and his staff come up with scores , on a scale of 0 to 100 , for more than 200 major U.S. companies and government agencies . They segment the results into forty-three industries and ten economic sectors and calculate scores for them as well . The numbers have reflected customers ' satisfaction with the leading goods and services in the American economy since 1994 , when the ACSI started . // " The modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fornell says , " particularly in the United States . This country had a great economic model in terms of producing more with less . And that worked well in manufacturing . But if you apply the same economic model and the same types of measurements to the service sector , it 's much more difficult . We were trying to run companies that are mostly service oriented as if they were manufacturing companies , and I just do n't think that is healthy . So I thought not only should we look at the quantity of economic output , but we should measure the quality . Because you can easily increase quantity , and quality suffers . And vice versa . They need to be better balanced . It 's something that has been neglected in economics , primarily because quality is a bit more difficult to measure . " // And measuring it from the consumer 's point of view is what Fornell says is unusual about the ACSI . " Traditional accounting leaves customer relationships off the balance sheet . It produces a distorted view of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to capture a much better understanding of a company 's current condition and its future capacity to produce wealth . " Fornell says this is partly because " spending to improve customer service is usually treated as a cost center rather than an investment . " Returns on an investment in one quarter might not come back in the next quarter , or even in the next year , after the initial investment . And when they do come back , Fornell says , they are n't necessarily seen as relating to the initial investment and are often credited to other factors . He is convinced , based on about fifteen years worth of data , that customer satisfaction is a leading indicator of a company 's long-term market value and financial health . // The exception he says , is in businesses where the customer has no real choice . " In the cable TV industry , forget it . " Comcast has had one of the lowest ACSI scores ( 54 in 2008 ) in the already low-scoring cable and satellite TV industry as a whole ( 64 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that Comcast has had a monopoly in many cities . Customers had few , if any , other options . So the company , and the industry , did not have the incentive " to treat their customers well . And they still have made a lot of money . Now recently , if you look at the return to investors , it has n't been that great . But as long as we have a system , or a particular part of a system , where there 's not punishment for being bad , then you can make a lot of money by actually treating your customers like dirt . The airline industry is another interesting example . But it 's a little different . We 're not treated very well there either , but airlines are not making money . " // The airline industry as a whole had an average ACSI score of only 62 in 2008 , down 13.9 percent from 1995 , the first year it was measured . By contrast , one of the highest-scoring industries is Internet retail , which scored an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amazon.com with a score of 88 , up 4.8 percent from its score of 84 the first year it was measured in 2000. // Fornell believes that as the way we measure our economy grows more nuanced , customer service will improve . " Maybe I 'm too optimistic , but I think it will be much more difficult in the future for companies to hide from the power of the buyer . " Increasingly , he says , the rule will be , " If you have consumer anger directed at your company , you better do something about it . " He is not much for clich ? s like " the customer is always right , " because , he says , " that is obviously not true . But what I do think is true is another saying : ' Take care of your customer , or somebody else will . ' " * // Scott Broetzmann has been paying attention to angry customers for much of his career . He majored in psychology and communication science at the University of Wisconsin , and went on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native Milwaukee and later nationally in Washington , D.C. A husband and father in his mid-forties , Broetzmann ( pronounced Brets-man ) is friendly , smart , and level headed  --  just the kind of guy most people would trust to analyze problems fairly and solve them humanely . After he left the Better Business Bureau , Broetzmann became a consultant on what the industry calls " the customer experience . " He collects data on it , analyzes it , and helps companies see the value of investing intelligently in their own customer service . // A few years ago , Broetzmann was reading a Washington Post article about store owners who were having a hard time holding on to staff because working in retail was so low paying and high stress . Broetzmann remembers the article depicting customers as " a bunch of jerks . " It immediately reminded him of actor Michael Douglas 's wry portrayal of an aggrieved customer gone wrong in the 1993 film Falling Down . // Douglas 's character , Bill Foster , is a man broken by the stresses of commuting , crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the everyday world . He reaches a breaking point in a fast food restaurant where he asks for breakfast at 11:32 one morning . The guy behind the counter says , " We stopped serving breakfast at 11:30 . " Foster appeals to him to help anyway . The worker refuses . Dejected and out of patience , Foster looks the guy in the eye and says , " Have you ever heard the expression , ' The customer is always right ? ' " The worker says , " Yeah . " Foster then says , " Yeah ? Well , here I am , the customer . " Driven by what he interprets as continued disregard by the worker , Foster then pulls out a machine gun and waves it around the restaurant until he gets his way . He continues his armed tirade against bad service across Los Angeles . After ransacking a convenience store where he felt mistreated , he tells the frightened owner , " I 'm just standing up for my rights as a consumer . " // Broetzmann also believes that customers often get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactics for combating that are nothing like those of Michael Douglas 's character . Broetzmann prefers to mediate between aggrieved customers and companies gone astray . He takes care always to approach both with understanding and a goal of helping each to see the other 's point of view . // That is why he felt a need to counter what he saw as growing hype about irrational customers . He started his quest with an Internet search of the word rage and got a smorgasbord of terms : road rage , air rage , retail rage , computer rage , travel and leisure rage . But he saw little on the justified indignation of reasonable people , which he had a feeling was more common than indicated in the sensational accounts he found . " Rage was being positioned in the marketplace , " Broetzmann says , " maybe unfairly , maybe fairly , as a bunch of crazy people who did wacky things . It just did n't seem right to me. " // Then the social scientist in him took over . His company , Customer Care Measurement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Arizona State University 's business school to gather some hard evidence on the phenomenon he was sensing . They created the Customer Rage Study and reported their first results in 2003 . The study was based on a telephone survey of a random sample of national households in which respondents who had trouble with a product or service during the past twelve months answered a series of questions about the problem they considered most serious . The study showed that approximately 68 percent said they were either extremely or very upset about their problem . Broetzmann and fellow researchers identified those people as experiencing " customer rage . " Another 28 percent were somewhat or a bit upset . Just 3 percent were not at all upset . // But the study went on . It asked those who were found to have " rage " to answer questions about the various ways they might have expressed their displeasure . Ninety percent said they shared their maddening story with other people , and 77 percent complained to the company that caused the problem . Of those who complained , customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company 's handling of their complaint : 57 percent decided never to do business with the company again , 28 percent yelled or raised their voice at a company employee , 8 percent cursed , and another 8 percent threatened legal action . // The Customer Rage Study came out again in 2004 , 2005 , and 2007 , and not much had changed from 2003 . The percentage of people with a complaint who reported experiencing rage rose or held steady each year , never again dipping below 70 percent . But in 2007 , 44 percent reported being " extremely upset , " as compared with an average of 41 percent in previous years . Each year the study became more detailed . Perhaps in homage to Michael Douglas 's movie character , or maybe just to make sure rage was n't about to get out of hand as it did in that movie , the 2004 study began asking about revenge . Each year since , on average , 15 percent of respondents have wanted revenge on the company they felt had wronged them .

He had been a star elementary school teacher in Los Angeles and New York since the late 1980s . His friends say patience , forgiveness , integrity , and a wry humor seem to be embedded in Harris 's DNA . But the customer service at AT&amp;T and Verizon pushed him past his limits during his move . // Harris and his partner , David Lebow , were set to move in on August 15 . On July 15 , Harris called to switch their current Verizon landline number to the new place . Moving it did n't cost anything ; he just had to get it done early so the line would be working when they moved in . But Verizon told him the previous tenants had not cancelled their account with AT&amp;T , so the new apartment 's phone lines were still live . Before his phone service could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Verizon customer service agent told Harris they could not cancel an AT&amp;T customer 's account . He would have to get AT&amp;T to do that . Verizon knew the account holder 's name and the phone number but could n't tell Harris , so he would have to cancel the account without any of the information or authority he needed . Harris called his new landlord for help , only to find he was in Greece for the month . Harris called Verizon one more time just to see if there was any other way . The agent told him they could install new lines into the apartment , but that would cost $300 . Harris decided to go ahead with it . The agent immediately made the appointment for Saturday , August 15 , move-in day . // Then Harris called AT&amp;T , on his Verizon phone , to see if he could get anywhere with them . He could n't proceed too far into the voice response system because he did n't have an account number ( an AT&amp;T phone number ) . When the system asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to get through . He was asked again for his account number . Finally , he shouted " agent " and " operator " at the voice response system . At first it told him it did not understand his response . But he just kept shouting " agent " repeatedly . Eventually it connected him to a live customer service agent , in India . Harris explained the situation . But when she asked him for the number of the line in the apartment , he could n't tell her . When she asked for the name of the customer , he did n't know . Finally , she told him that all she could do was report it as an abandoned line . She would file the form , but it would take two weeks to turn off the line . So by the beginning of August , the line should be free to set up his Verizon service . He was skeptical and asked her to give him a number he could call to check on it . She assured him the old phone line would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked again for a phone number to check on it . She would n't give in . Harris hung up , warily . // Then he called Verizon back to cancel the appointment to put in new lines . They transferred him to the maintenance line . The technicians advised him not to cancel the appointment unless he was positive the line was free , because then he might be left in the lurch . He agreed , and so they transferred him back to the agent . She told Harris that if the line was free when they came out and they did n't have to install new wires , the service call would cost only $80 . Then without really saying it , the Verizon agent mentioned that one way to get around this was to call AT&amp;T and pretend to be somebody who could get the line cancelled . Harris understood her point , but lying was not really in his nature . // Three weeks later , about five days before moving day , Harris and Lebow were at the apartment cleaning it . Harris called AT&amp;T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been cancelled . He somehow maneuvered himself to something called AT&amp;T Local . The agent was in the United States this time . Harris told his story , replete with the confirmation number . The agent told him that the line had not been cancelled . No form had been filed . She said the confirmation number he had meant nothing . It was a fake . They did n't issue those kinds of numbers . She said the only way to cancel the account was to have the person who owns the building or the account holder do it . Then she asked , " Who are you again ? " Before the call , Lebow had run down to the mailboxes for the apartment and gotten the two names of the previous tenants off it  --  a male name and a female name . So Harris did n't lie , but answered that the account holder was one of the two names . The agent told him it was the woman he mentioned . That helped . At least he had the name now . But the AT&amp;T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new order to cancel the abandoned line . She would n't promise it would be done by Saturday , but he was welcome to call back and check then . // On Saturday morning , a few hours before Verizon was due to arrive , Lebow was unpacking , and Harris went in the back room to call AT&amp;T one more time . He now knew which buttons to press and which prompts to use to get where he needed to be . As he waited on hold , he planned what he would say . // Harris was born and grew up in Jamaica , Queens , in New York City . His father was a bus driver and his mother a nurse . He had gone to Columbia University , the first in his family to make it to the Ivy League . Sitting on hold that morning in his new apartment , Harris says something clicked . " I realized they were n't going to give me a straight answer . " Then he thought of the woman at Verizon who seemed to be nudging him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AT&amp;T operator came on the line , he found himself yelling into the phone in a Greek accent . " Yes , hello . My name is Stavros Papadopoulos , " the name of his landlord . " It all came together , " says Harris . " It was such a big lie , and it just felt so weird because everybody had been saying that they were taking care of this , and they were n't . " He went on impersonating his landlord . The agent told him the line was not cancelled yet . He did a whole riff on how he was a very busy man and had no time to deal with their incompetence . " What kind of business are you running ? " he asked , his Greek accent holding strong . " I need this to end now . " Suddenly , the agent was very apologetic . " But I blustered on , " says Harris . // Lebow had heard the yelling and wondered what was going on . He came to the door but did n't go in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek accent . Thinking he might ruin it for laughing , he stepped away . " Tell me who to call . I want names and numbers . My tenant needs to move in . What kind of people say they will do something and then do n't do it ? " In the end , the woman said she would take care of it right away and that the line should be free in minutes . She apologized profusely and thanked him for calling AT&amp;T . Harris said , " Thank you . I apologize for yelling . It was nothing against you . How do you say  --  you seem like a very nice lady . " When Verizon came an hour later , it was done . Harris felt a little guilty but says , " It was so frustrating . They make you do things you would n't normally do . " // In that 2001 rudeness survey by Public Agenda , 69 percent of respondents said they believed the problem of a lack of consideration and courtesy in our society was getting worse . And 52 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed with them for a long time afterward . But one point in the study raised a question that is debatable : 73 percent of respondents said they believe Americans used to treat people with more respect and courtesy in the past , while 21 percent believe that is simply nostalgia for a past that never existed . // A look back at how customer service has evolved ( or devolved ) in this country , especially customer service by telephone , not only confirms the merit of both those opinions about the past in the rudeness study , but also shows how we got to where we are today .
