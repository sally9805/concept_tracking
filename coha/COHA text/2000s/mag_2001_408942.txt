Section : Caring for Mom &; Dad " I work full-time and care for my mom , who lives with me and has mild Alzheimer 's disease . I do n't want to put her in a nursing home , but she 's not safe alone , and I ca n't afford to have someone stay with her . Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated . " <p> Your question gives me an opportunity to write about one of my favorite subjects : adult day care . This remains one of the most underutilized ways of keeping an older person at home when chronic medical problems and/or functional disability make it otherwise impossible . <p> In these innovative programs , the older person is brought to a facility where their social needs ( and often medical as well ) are met . During this time , the primary caregiver ( usually an adult child or spouse ) goes to work or just gets a break . Transportation is often provided as part of the package . One of my favorite caregivers likes to tell how the entire extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school bus can pick up her children and the adult day-care bus can pick up her mom . Programs for Different Needs <p> In general , adult day-care programs come in two types : social and medical . The former model focuses on integrating the older person into a meaningful social fabric through a variety of activities : art classes , bingo , field trips , and communal meals ; the possibilities really are endless . Some programs provide assistance with bathing and other personal care needs that would otherwise be difficult for busy working family members . <p> Medical adult day care adds an additional layer . During the course of the day , a variety of health care needs are met . These include blood pressure monitoring , physical and/or occupational therapy , and administration of medicines . In some states , medical adult day care is covered , at least in part , by Medicaid , the same government program that pays for the majority of nursing home care . ( See " Who Pays ? " on p. 181 . ) Picking the Right Program <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David V. Pomeranz , associate executive director of The Hebrew Home for the Aged in Riverdale , NY , and an expert on adult day care , suggests using the same tactics you 'd use for choosing a nursing home . In fact , many good long-term care facilities have adult day-care centers affiliated with them or located directly on site . <p> " Visit the facility several times at different times of the day , and find out as much as you can about the people who work there , " he says . " How long has the home been in operation ? What are the qualifications of the individuals running the place ? What is the frontline staff like who have the most contact with clients ? In the case of a medical-model adult day care , how will the staff coordinate their efforts with the older person 's physician and other health care providers ? " <p> For a list of potential homes in your area , contact the local area agency on aging ( listed in the phone book ) , social workers in your community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mouth is also an excellent source of referral information . Why Have n't I Heard about This ? <p> Given this jewel of an idea and the aging of America , you 'd think that adult day-care centers would be popping up all over the US . While growth has been substantial over the past decade , in many communities ( including several where my patients live ) , there is a shortage of quality adult day care . <p> " Adult day care is certainly catching on , " says Pomeranz , " but there is still some resistance on the part of patients and family members who worry that the programs may be childlike , because of the unfortunate name that the care industry has given to this crucial service . Nothing could be further from the truth . <p> " The fact is , quality adult day-care programs offer great opportunities for frail older people to make real social connections with their peers , while also affording their caregiver the crucial downtime she needs to recharge her batteries or go to work , " he adds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another obvious benefit . " <p> Recently , Pomeranz launched a hugely popular nighttime adult day-care program , enabling family members to go out to dinner , see a show , or just get refreshed from a good night 's sleep . Volunteer Training Tool <p> Caring for the elderly requires more than just a willingness to help ; it also requires skills and training . Now there 's a free , comprehensive manual available to organizations who train volunteers . Called " Caring to Help Others : A Training Manual for Preparing Volunteers to Assist Caregivers of Older Adults , " it was sponsored by Eisai Inc. and nine other caregiving organizations to help groups train volunteer caregivers . If your organization would like a copy , write to Caring to Help Others , P.O.

Lachs , MD , MPH , Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of geriatrics for the New York Presbyterian Health System , and associate professor of medicine at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University , all in New York City . Dr. Lachs is a Beeson Physician Faculty Scholar in Aging Research with the American Federation for Aging Research . He has a private practice in New York City . <p> with Pamela Boyer <p> WHO PAYS ? <p> The cost of adult day care can range from $20 a day in the case of limited or subsidized local programs to more than $135 a day for complex medical programs that include transportation . Costs vary by geographic location . In some states , medical adult day care is paid for by Medicaid ( typically as a percentage of what the program would have to pay for a nursing home day ) , but clients must meet clinical and financial eligibility criteria . Administrators of the program or a social worker can often assist families with this process . In general , the majority of social adult day-care programs are paid for out of pocket , as health insurance programs rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies will gladly cover the cost of adult day care , because it is a fraction of the cost of nursing-home care . If you 're considering purchasing such a policy for yourself or a loved one , make sure you inquire about whether the policy includes such a benefit . <p>
