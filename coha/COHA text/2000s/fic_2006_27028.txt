It was a bright June morning in Wyoming , and the students in Mr. Masterson 's history class settled down at their desks to begin their final exam . Katy McLaughlin read the essay question , but she already knew what the topic would be -- America 's settlement of the west . And she knew what her teacher was expecting everyone to write : it had been America 's destiny to expand westward , bringing its ordered homes and ranches , fences and schools -- sturdy brick schools like this one , the Laramie Academy -- to tame the wild and unruly land . Katy closed her eyes for a moment and thought of her favorite painting , the one that hung above the stairwell at home on her family 's ranch where she spent her summers . In the sage green and dusty hues of the prairie , it showed a herd of exuberant wild horses charging across an open range under a glittering blue sky . She picked up her pencil . " What does it mean to follow your destiny ? " she wanted to write . But certain thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Masterson would not appreciate . Her pencil motionless , she stared out the window , daydreaming . People say it was America 's destiny to go west . Pioneers fled crowded eastern cities to find freedom and self-reliance in thewilderness . I say it was all a big con , a hoax ! I wish they all stayed home , Katy thought . Dragging herself out of the daydream , Katy tried to rein in her ideas , tried to say something acceptable , something Mr. Masterson would think sounded studious and sensible . But her thoughts galloped away across the wide prairie , like the wild horses she imagined bursting out of their picture frame and running free . " They called themselves settlers , " her imaginary essay continued , " but there was nothing ' settled ' about them . They could n't fence the land fast enough . It happened almost overnight . The truth is , wherever a ' settler ' left his footprint , there was a hoofprint beside it . A dog may be man 's best friend , but the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd think people would 've been thankful to them . But no ! They could n't rest until there was no open range left for the herds -- nothing wild left in the great American wilderness . They say the American west was a paradise and it was our destiny to claim it . I say , call someplace paradise and kiss it good-bye ! " Katy was startled out of her reverie by the end-of-period bell . Most of her classmates had already finished their essays and were filing out the door . The blank pages of her exam booklet glared up at her accusingly . She twirled one of her long , dark braids until wild wispy strands began to unravel . " I 've got to write something ! Anything ! " she thought , but there was no time . Mr. Masterson , with his neatly trimmed beard and impeccably pressed trousers , loomed over her . " Time 's up , Katy . " She stared at him , speechless , as he collected her booklet . It was a disaster ! Just like the whole semester before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academy students , in their regulation blue blazers and green-and-blue striped school ties , gathered in the auditorium to receive their end-of-year grades . Katy rushed in late as usual . She stood apart from her classmates who were laughing and flirting and making plans to visit each other over the summer . As the prefect entered , the students grew quiet and waited for their names to be called . " Edwards , Hansen , Bradley , Wilson , Koop . . . " the prefect called out . Miranda Koop , a couple of years older than Katy , grabbed her report card and rushed over to Katy . " Thank God I caught you before you left , " she said breathlessly . The dark-haired girl untied a bright bandana from her wrist and tied it around Katy 's . " Could you give this to Howard ? " she asked . Katy 's older brother , Howard , was home on the ranch helping her dad with the horses . She would be seeing him tomorrow . " Not a problem , " she replied . Katy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , but a knot formed in her stomach as she imagined how her father would react to her report card . " Thanks , Katy , " said Miranda . " I think I 'll be seeing a lot of you this summer . " Miranda 's friend Gracie sailed past them . " See you next year ! " she cried . " See you in September , Gracie ! " sang Miranda cheerfully . As Miranda breezed away with her friends , Katy found herself face-to-face with the prefect . " McLaughlin , " he said , holding out an official white envelope emblazoned with the academy crest . " You need to see the headmaster . " Katy took the envelope . She did not even have to open it to know what the headmaster was going to say . After this year 's troubles , there was no way she would be promoted to the next grade . She climbed aboard the school van and crawled into the backseat , hoping no one would notice her . It felt good to be on the road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind her . Soon she was looking out the window at the beautiful green short-grass hills of Wyoming . Near dusk , they pulled up at a service station . Six kids tumbled out and rushed into their parents ' waiting arms . Katy could see the Neversummer Mountains in the distance . Her family home was a couple of hours farther on -- a majestic horse ranch high in the foothills . She imagined her father meeting her in their maroon Chevy truck . She clutched the official white envelope , damp and crumpled in her fist like an empty tube of toothpaste . The sun had set and the crickets were singing by the time Katy spotted her dad 's tall , slim silhouette leaning against the side of the truck . The van pulled up beside him . Katy hesitated , staying rooted to her seat so long that her dad had to crane his neck and peer in to see if she was there . She slid out of the van , and the driver honked a friendly farewell .
