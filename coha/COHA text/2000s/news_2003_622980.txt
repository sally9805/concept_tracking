<p> Ninety-eight years after Albert Einstein began to transform physics , scientists continue to question his ideas . <p> So far , he 's survived every crucial challenge , including the latest : a challenge to his premise that light and gravity travel at the same speed . Last week in Seattle , scientists announced that in fact , gravity and light travel at the same speed , at least within a 20 percent margin of error . <p> But 20 percent , they admit , is a huge margin of error , the kind of margin one expects in Enron accounting and Hollywood bookkeeping . To put it in perspective : Twenty percent of the speed of light is more than 36,000 miles per second , a distance equal to more than four times the diameter of Earth . <p> Conceivably , so huge a margin of error might conceal a significant difference in gravity and light speeds . So Einstein 's challengers still hope to find flaws in his general theory of relativity . <p> They draw comfort from the history of science . Even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tend to be mortal . They emerge , enthrall the world for a while , then fall , to be succeeded by more comprehensive theories . <p> HOW EINSTEIN UPSTAGED NEWTON <p> Physicists are especially haunted by the fate of Isaac Newton , Einstein 's predecessor as the Grand Poobah of physics . Newton 's notions survived repeated challenges for more than two centuries . To many , he was the greatest man who ever lived . <p> Then came the early 20th century , when Newton was upstaged by Einstein and his fellow relativity and quantum theorists . They showed how Newtonianism  --  while dandy for explaining " everyday " phenomena such as falling apples and orbiting satellites  --  founders on the scales of the very small ( within atoms ) and the very big ( across galactic space ) . Einstein became the new Newton , the man of the century , as Time magazine anointed him in 2000 . <p> But now , Einstein himself may be vulnerable . This is because of the recent challenge to one of his many key assumptions  --  that light and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second . <p> According to that assumption , when you look at the moon , which is about 240,000 miles away , you see it as it appeared slightly more than a second ago . Likewise , at any given moment , the attractive force of lunar gravity takes the same time to pass from the moon to Earth , where it influences oceanic tides . <p> But be warned : In science , " assumption " is a dangerous word . Einstein did n't formally prove the equality of gravity and light speed . He just took it for granted . <p> One ca n't really blame him : He was a busy guy , struggling to revamp physics and cosmology while accepting his Nobel Prize , opposing militarism , dining with Charlie Chaplin , explaining arithmetic to schoolgirls , and escaping the Nazis . He did n't have time to try to double-check every assumption that he plugged into his equations . <p> CALCULATING SLIGHT DIFFERENCE <p> Still , that unexamined assumption may be the beginning of his downfall . According to certain novel theories of physics and cosmology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , physicists Csaba Csaki of Cornell University , Joshua Erlich of the University of Washington and Christophe Grojean of Saclay , France , have proposed what they call their " brane world scenario " of physics . ( " Brane " stands for " membrane . " ) <p> They suspect the universe contains extra , undetected dimensions besides the three everyday dimensions of height , width and depth , plus the Einsteinian fourth dimension of time . Their calculations imply a slight difference in gravity and light speeds , perhaps just " a tiny fraction of a percent , " Csaki told The Chronicle . <p> Over the centuries , physicists ' estimates of the speed of gravity have varied wildly . In Newton 's era , many assumed it was instantaneous . In 1825 , the French astrophysicist Pierre-Simon Laplace estimated gravity traveled at least 10 million times faster than light . After Einstein 's rise to fame , though , most physicists accepted his assumption that light and gravity speeds are equal . <p> That assumption was experimentally tested in September by radioastronomer Ed Fomalont of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sergei Kopeikin , an associate professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Missouri at Columbia . <p> For their experiment , they observed how the gravitational pull of the giant planet Jupiter interacted with light from a superbright " quasar " 30 million light-years from Earth . <p> Since the late 1910s , astronomers have known that a strong gravitational source can bend the path of light . For example , the gravity of the sun will bend light from a star , making the star appear to be in a slightly different position . <p> A variation on this classic technique allowed Fomalont and Kopeikin to determine the speed of gravity emanated by Jupiter when it and the quasar passed within seven arc minutes of each other on Sept. 8 . They observed the Jupiter-quasar encounter with 11 radiotelescopes around the world , up to 6,000 miles apart . Thanks to a technique called radio interferometry , they were able to treat the data from the 11 radiotelescopes as if they were a single giant radiotelescope 6,000 miles wide . <p> In advance , they calculated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then the gravity of Jupiter should alter the apparent position of the quasar by an extraordinarily slight distance , equal to one-billionth the visual diameter of the full moon . <p> " This is the most accurate astronomical measurement ever made , ( equivalent to measuring ) the width of a human hair 250 miles away , " observatory spokesman Chuck Blue said last week . <p> OVERCOMING BAD WEATHER <p> In such cutting-edge scientific experiments , things rarely go smoothly . Fomalont and Kopeikin observed for a total of five days at all 11 radiotelescopes , resulting in 55 " radiotelescope days . " Of those , eight " days " had observing problems that included bad weather and several short power glitches , Fomalont said . <p> Weather was the No. 1 headache . Rain , wind and clouds distort the atmosphere , refracting light from the quasar and shifting its apparent position in the sky . <p> Likewise , water in a glass refracts light from a soda straw , making it appear bent . Similar atmospheric turbulence causes the familiar " twinkling " of stars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slow time scale of minutes and moves the apparent position of the quasar by an amount which is typically 10 times larger than the effect we are trying to measure , " Fomalont noted . In the end , such problems forced them to discard about 12 percent of their recorded data . <p> Still , last week at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Seattle , they were able to announce their conclusion : The speeds of gravity and light are the same , at least within a 20 percent margin of error . <p> " Had the weather been perfect everywhere  --  no clouds , etc.  --  I think we could have gotten to a 10 percent " margin of error , Fomalont added . Unfortunately , they wo n't be able to repeat the experiment for another 10 years : That 's how long it 'll be before a similar close encounter between Jupiter and a quasar . <p> The achievement draws praise from Csaki : " I am quite amazed that this really difficult measurement of the speed of gravity was possible at all without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly a very important step . " <p> Although the Fomalont-Kopeikin experiment did n't detect a difference between gravity and light speeds , as predicted by Csaki and his colleagues ' theory , Csaki said " I am not surprised " because of the experiment 's large margin of error . <p> Not everyone in the astrophysical community welcomed the Fomalont-Kopeikin experiment , though . According to Fomalont , " There are people who say there 's no way the speed of gravity could be different from the speed of light "  --  so why bother looking ? <p> Such talk mystifies Fomalont : " You never know . Do n't be a spoilsport ! " <p> E-mail Keay Davidson at **25;8523;TOOLONG
