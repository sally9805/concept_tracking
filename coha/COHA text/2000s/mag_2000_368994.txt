The idea came out of left field . Electrical engineer Ronald Nutt and physicist David Townsend , working at the University of Geneva in Switzerland , had just taken the cover off their newly developed metabolic-imaging machine and were admiring its innards when an oncology surgeon happened by . " You have a lot of space between those detectors , " he offered . " You ought to try to put something in there that would be useful . " <P> At the time , eight years ago , PET ( positron emission tomography ) machines , which can reveal subtle metabolic processes such as tumor growth , and CT ( computerized tomography ) scanners , which show precise anatomical details , were already in widespread medical use . But doctors , especially cancer surgeons , were often frustrated in their attempts to match the two different scans to determine , for example , the precise location of a tumor in relation to an organ or to the spinal column . There seemed to be no better way than simply " eyeballing " the two separate images . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epiphany in the Alps . Last October the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the marketing of a combination PET/CT machine , the first medical-imaging device that simultaneously and clearly reveals both anatomical details and metabolic processes within the body . By early next year the new scanners will be installed at Manhattan 's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center , Indiana University , the University of Iowa and other medical facilities . <P> Others had attempted , with little success , to match the two different images by using computer algorithms as a way to unify data from CT and PET scans made at different times and in different settings . " The problem is that the body is kind of a flimsy structure , " says Nutt , co-founder of CTI , the Knoxville , Tenn. , imaging company that is gearing up to produce the new scanning combine . " If you lay it on the bed one time for a CT scan and another time for a PET scan , just a small difference in body position will result in all of the organs shifting about a bit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> After refining their combined PET and CT concept for three years , Nutt and Townsend , who had transferred from the University of Geneva to the University of Pittsburgh , received a three-year , $1.5 million grant from the National Cancer Institute in 1995 that enabled them to complete a prototype machine . Installed at the University of Pittsburgh medical center in 1998 , it has been used successfully to scan some 200 patients . <P> In many of these cases , says Dr. Carolyn Cidis Meltzer , who with Townsend is a co-director of the University of Pittsburgh pet facility , the use of the PET/CT machine has resulted in decisions to modify or change treatment . In one case a standard CT scan had detected a tumor on the left side of a patient 's neck but none elsewhere . " When CTs are read and you look for a spread of tumor to the lymph nodes , " Meltzer explains , " all you 're able to look at is the size of the lymph node . " <P> If a CT shows that a lymph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is considered to be normal . But on the PET/CT , Meltzer says , " we saw a very small lymph node in the right side of the neck that we thought was involved with the tumor . " A biopsy that otherwise would not have been performed confirmed her suspicion .
