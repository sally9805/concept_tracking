Thinking of retiring to a formerly hot market ? The real estate slowdown has made parts of the Sunbelt a lot more affordable . Our guide to finding the best deals in five markets . FAST-FLIPPING INVESTORS are n't the only ones who love condos . For many empty nesters , nothing beats selling the big old house in the suburbs and hightailing it to a luxury development where sun and golf are plentiful and maintenance is minimal . And what better time to go shopping than during a real estate slowdown ? It was condos , after all , that rose the fastest  --  and fell the hardest . There should be deals aplenty , right ? As it turns out , it 's not that simple . Some markets have already recovered , while others have yet to hit rock bottom  --  and not every place was as overbuilt as , say , Miami . To get the real picture , we zeroed in on five once-scorching cities and talked to brokers , analysts , buyers , and sellers . Read on for our results , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . And get ready to sell the lawn mower . MIAMI VULTURES CIRCLING In housing markets across the country , the reassuring refrain goes a little something like this : At least it 's not as bad as Miami . Nowhere has the real estate slowdown hit as hard as it has here . At the height of the boom , speculators gorged on condos , lining up for lotteries and flipping paper units . Then , in 2005 , the market turned , and the buyers vanished . Now the vultures are circling , almost literally . Peter Zalewski 's year-old firm , Condo Vultures , tracks units that stall on the market for more than 100 days and shed at least 10% or $100,000 in price . His database now lists more than 1,400 condos . Zalewski recently let FORTUNE tag along as he sized up a vacant two-bedroom penthouse in a 35-story tower overlooking Biscayne Bay . With $10,000 in monthly costs , the seller  --  an investor who failed to flip  --  has already cut his price from $1.2 million to $849,000 . Besides the hefty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features : an unfinished concrete floor . " It tells you the seller is desperate , " he says . Desperation hangs in the air here  --  and analysts say today 's market is only a prelude to a bigger glut . Nearly 8,000 units are on the way this year , with another 12,000 coming in 2008 , says Jack McCabe of McCabe Research &; Consulting in Deerfield Beach , Fla . Bob Zimmel , a 55-year-old health-care exec in Bethlehem , Pa. , and a Condo Vultures client , is one buyer who is willing to wait . " I think the market 's still going to settle out in the next 18 months , " he says . If you ca n't wait that long , consider leasing in the meantime . The owners of a similar empty penthouse in the Biscayne Bay tower are looking to rent  --  so badly that they 've dropped their monthly price from $4,500 to $2,800 . NAPLES CALM ON THE COAST It 's just a two-hour drive from Miami , but Naples is another world , as famous for its sun-drenched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . The tony resort town attracts everyone from retired NFL coaches  --  Mike Ditka has a home here  --  to former auto execs . During the real estate boom , Naples regularly landed at the top of housing analysts ' overpriced-markets lists . But last year a chill fell over this pristine town and its expansive golf courses . Pending condo sales dropped 43% from the first quarter to the fourth , and median prices fell 17% as buyers chose to wait out the frenzy . Other scare factors : Florida 's soaring insurance costs and a real estate downturn in the Midwest , where many Naples retirees come from . " It even hurt the high end , " says Richard Baker , president of luxury-condo developer Lutgert . His latest building on Naples ' Park Shore Beach , the Aria , still had unsold units after it opened last October . " People were just not buying , " he says . But some experts say the market is starting to stabilize . While there 's still excess inventory  --  a 36-month supply of new condos , plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  construction has halted , and the glut is mostly in the lower end of the market . ( Yes , Naples has a low end . ) That means now might be the time for the skittish to come off the sidelines . And buyers may be doing just that : Baker says three $2 million condos sold in the Aria last month . " The savvy second-home buyer is seeing that this is a good time , " says Naples Area Board of Realtors president Spencer Haynes . " There 's choice now , and they might be able to negotiate a better deal . " For this ritzy enclave , that kind of opportunity does n't come around often . PHOENIX RAISING ARIZONA When most people think of retiring to Arizona , they picture a quiet life in a development on a golf course . But in the past five years Arizona 's sprawling metropolises  --  Phoenix , Scottsdale , and Tempe  --  have begun to go vertical , adding luxury high-rises to markets in which condos have typically meant low-rise starter homes or senior-citizen-friendly " active communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , touting proximity to downtown and swanky amenities like concierge service . The big question is whether the Manhattanization of this market , where condos make up just 8% of the housing stock , will take off . The real estate rush that triggered this spurt has waned , stalling Arizona 's single-family home market , which has seen sales slide 47% from 2005 It 's still early for the condo market , though , and analysts say its late start prevented overbuilding . Already some projects have been put on hold . The early buildings , on the other hand , have already given buyers opportunities to pick up units from overleveraged speculators . Last fall Ray Slomski , a Phoenix attorney , bought a $1.7 million apartment in a new luxury mid-rise  --  for exactly what an investor paid in 2005 Slomski leases the unit now , but it 's an option if he and his wife decide on apartment life when their kids go to college . " If we were going to downsize , this is the place we 'd want to live , " says Slomski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entertainment terrace for parties . Selling the urban lifestyle in Phoenix may be a challenge . But bullish brokers say these new condos offer exactly what retirees flocking from cities like Chicago have long sought here  --  not just another home in the suburbs . LAS VEGAS UPPING THE ANTE Like any good Vegas adventure , the real estate boom in the desert had a cast of colorful characters , more bluster than action , and , for some , a rough morning after . Starting in 2003 , legions of developers swooped into Sin City , heralding plans for more than 100 luxury-condo projects totaling some 70,000 units . But as the cold reality of land and construction costs set in , most packed up and left town . " It was typical Vegas  --  a lot of hype , " says local real estate consultant John Restrepo , who estimates that only 10% of the projects actually got off the ground . So while the lower end of the Las Vegas condo market swoons  --  the total number of units for sale is up 63% since last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's likely to stay that way . The majority of the towers are in the so-called resort corridor , the Strip and its environs , popular with foreign buyers benefiting from a weak dollar . " To those buyers , a million-dollar condo is very reasonable , " says Bruce Hiatt , co-owner of Luxury Realty Group . Foreign buyers have already snapped up 30% of the units in a new Mandarin Oriental residence scheduled for fall 2009 The rest of the building , part of a $7 billion MGM Mirage project , is almost sold out : 90% of its 227 units , which start at $1.5 million , sold within two weeks of release . Where does that leave potential buyers ? Analysts say prices are n't likely to drop from here . But in a few years there will be more inventory as well as ample opportunity in resales , when the earliest investors who locked in the best prices start to sell . " In two or three years your choices are going to be phenomenal , " says Sean Brown , CEO of the Vegas-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Vegas it pays to hold . SAN DIEGO BETWEEN INNINGS As they try for a division title three-peat this year , the San Diego Padres are playing in front of a much bigger crowd . Five new condo towers have sprung up since last season around Petco Park in the city 's still-gritty East Village neighborhood . But on a recent evening one right-field newcomer , the 223-unit Park Terrace , is mostly dark . Like other buildings that went up after the market peaked here in 2005 , it 's caught in a real estate downturn . Forty percent of its units are still unsold , with concessions like waiving closing costs and home  --  owners ' association fees the only way to lure buyers . More than 5,800 condos were added to San Diego 's burgeoning downtown in the past five years , and prices here have doubled since 1999 But the speculators who stoked that frenzy have by all accounts left  --  and pricing has remained stubbornly flat . " I thought San Diego would fall in price further and faster than it has , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet there are encouraging signs for bargain hunters . Plenty of inventory is on the way : An estimated 4,380 units will be completed through 2008 , with another 1,700 scheduled for 2009 As a swell of new condos near their move-in dates , London predicts that the influx will force double-digit percentage price drops , not just around the ballpark but throughout the city 's downtown . He 's careful to note that he sees big potential for the area 's livability  --  just not for its short-term condo markets . " My five-year forecast is pretty positive , " he says . " But it could get dicey over the next two years . " The Padres , on the other hand , may have a pretty good shot this season . BOX MIAMI 'S VICE NEARLY 8,000 units will be completed this year , with another 12,000 coming in 2008 EXISTING-CONDO sales are down 30% from a year ago . ONE FIRM that tracks units that have sat on the market for 100 days or more has a database of 1,400 condos . BOX WELL HEELED  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way , a 36-month supply based on current market conditions . MEDIAN CONDO price fell 17% last year to $315,000 ; pending sales plummeted 43% . A CALMER market and price adjustments are slowly bringing buyers back into this highly desirable  --  and pricey  --  haven . BOX A PLACE IN THE SUN SINGLE-FAMILY homes have long dominated here , but 4,200 high-rise units are on the way . GROWTH SLOWED last year ; sales of single-family homes are down 47% from 2005 SOME CONDO projects were put on hold after the rest of the market stalled , reducing inventory  --  but savvy buyers can still find deals . BOX HIGH STAKES THE LUXURY-CONDO boom here was mostly hype . Just 10% of 70,000 planned units are actually being built . DEMAND is still high : 90% of Mandarin Oriental 's new units , priced at $1.5 million and up , sold within two weeks . CHOICES WILL be better in two to three years , when more towers are finished and investor resales start to kick in . BOX WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR DEVELOPERS added more than 5,800 condos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a condo jumped from $337,000 to $710,000 since 1999 ANOTHER 6,000 units are coming .
