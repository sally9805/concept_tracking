A high-priced lawyer , a low-priced lawyer and the tooth fairy are sitting at a table on which rests a $100 bill . The lights go out briefly , and when they come back on the bill is gone . Who took it ? Obviously , the high-priced lawyer-the other two are figments of our imaginations . Here is another such figment : People who vote for a presidential candidate because of that candidate 's running mate . There may be such people , but have you ever met one ? Still , it is neither pointless nor premature to wonder who each of the four most likely nominees-Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama , Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney-might choose to run with . The question illuminates the different challenges the candidates face in cobbling together 270 electoral votes . A presidential nominee can try to do one or more of four things with the vice presidential selection . The nominee can try to heal a divided party by selecting the strongest loser in the nomination contest ( e.g. , Ronald Reagan 's selection of George H.W. Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hippocratic oath " selection-one that does no harm . Such a running mate has done nothing embarrassing ( when vetting potential running mates , the nominee 's agents hope for candor when they ask , " What is it that your wife does not know ? " ) and will not say something embarrassing in October . The nominee can select someone who might attract a slice-ethnic , religious , ideological-of the national electorate . This assumes that lots of voters nationally will favor the top of the ticket because of the bottom of it . ( See above : Imagination , figment of . ) Most realistically , the nominee can select someone bland ( " do no harm " ) from a state where the running mate might give the ticket a small boost but one sufficient to capture electoral votes otherwise unattainable . Such calculations are risky : John Kerry chose North Carolina 's John Edwards , but lost that state , and the congressional district Edwards lives in , and even Edwards 's precinct . If Clinton wins the nomination with Obama a strong second , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She will receive at least 90 percent of the black vote without him and she should not need help in Illinois , which has not voted Republican since 1988 . She is a cautious calculator , comfortable around people she knows well . Her Senate office is across the hall from that of Evan Bayh , the preternaturally cautious former two-term governor of Indiana . Winning that state 's 11 electoral votes-it has not voted Democratic since 1964-would seriously complicate any Republican 's path to 270 . If she wants to reach for a bigger electoral-vote prize without removing a Democrat from the Senate , there is Ted Strickland , the popular governor of the Center of the Universe Every Fourth Year , a.k.a . Ohio ( 20 electoral votes ) . As the Democrats ' nominee , Obama 's largest vulnerability would be his inexperience regarding foreign and military affairs . He could pick a former four-star Army general with diplomatic experience brokering peace in the Balkans-Wesley Clark . Or if Obama worried that such a choice might indicate insecurity , he could pick the governor of a Red-actually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Virginia ( 13 electoral votes ) , which has not voted Democratic since 1964 . If Romney is the Republican nominee , that will indicate that he has assuaged social conservatives ' suspicions about his late conversions to their causes . If Giuliani is the nominee , that will be in spite of the fact that social conservatives remain wary . Many of them might stay home in November 2008 to ensure a " purposeful loss " that teaches the party not to choose pro-choice nominees . Giuliani 's biggest weakness is his personal history and his weakest region is the South , where almost 40 percent of Republicans live . He could select the guitar-playing former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee , the Baptist minister who is as cuddly as Giuliani is abrasive . Giuliani would have to hope that Huckabee would stifle his impulse to say entertaining but idiotic things , such as : We can be energy independent in 10 years and then tell Saudi Arabia we " have about as much interest in their oil as we do their sand . " Romney might be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A former business executive , he is partial to people who have run large entities , which would point him toward other governors . That would reinforce his theme that Washington can not be improved by people acculturated to its milieu . Because the winner of the presidency usually wins a majority of the states in the Mississippi Valley , Romney might select Matt Blunt , 37 , of Missouri , the bellwether state : It is the only state that has voted with every presidential winner since 1956 . Or Minnesota Gov . Tim Pawlenty , who turns 47 this week . Minnesota ( 10 electoral votes ) is the only state that has voted Democratic in eight consecutive presidential elections . Few voters will vote for the running mate rather than the person who chose him . But many voters might vote for the person at the top of the ticket because of what the bottom of the ticket says about the person at the top . Actually , most of those at the top of tickets probably regret the 12th Amendment . Before it was ratified in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running mates . <p>
