Usually we keep to drawn cartoons around here , but this short piece struck the fanny bones around our offices so well that we decided to run it . As one editor commented , " It 's just so wrong ... in the right ways , that is . " Tim McDaniel 's previous appearance in our pages was " Le Morte d'Volkswagyn " back in our June 2000 issue . He lives in the Seattle area and teaches English as a second language . <p> " DOES N'T DO IT FOR YOU , huh ? " Mary shook her head . She sat amid the rumpled sheets , her eyes downcast . Mark sat on the edge of the bed , slumped and sweaty . Mark stripped off the latex mask and bent down to remove the velcro from his feet . " I 'll put the iguanas back in their cage , then . " " Mmm hmm . " Mark returned to the bedroom and slapped his hands . " Well , what should we play then ? Bill and Monica ? " Mary shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been getting old . Thelma and Louise ? " Mary shrugged . " Bush and Cheney ? Flying Monkey and Toto ? Spock and Worf ? " Mary thought not . " Well , we can get the darts out again , or paint each other yellow and hang from the ceiling . Or get the weed whacker out , with the paint thinner . No ? What , then ? " " Oh , I do n't know , " said Mary . " It 's getting harder to be original , I guess . You 've been getting bored with the same old scenarios too . I know . " " Yeah . But there must be something . Shrek and Donkey ? " Mary looked at him . " Again ? " She turned back to the window . " Well , what then ? Get out those sandpaper gloves ? I know they 're around here somewhere . Or get the laminating machine going ? Maybe the garden gnomes and the ball bearings ? " " Oh , Mark . It 's the same old thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weird , for a change . " Mark nodded . " Yeah . We have got ourselves into a rut . " They were silent for a while , each trying to come up with a proposal , a suggestion that would reignite their flagging sex life . " Sometimes I wish I was just normal , " Mary said . She got up and went to the bedroom window . " Someone who would n't mind just hopping into bed and doing it . Someone who can be content imagining their husband is Tom Cruise , instead of it always having to be a terrorist or a gerbil . " " Yeah , " Mark agreed . " I know what you mean . But we are what we are , right ? " They lapsed again into silence . " Hey . What 's that ? " Mark looked up at the sound of Mary 's voice . " What ? " " Out the window . That light . " Mark looked . " Huh . Looks like it 's coming down . " " It 's getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . " Is that a silvery dome at the top ? " " Looks like it . Or maybe , I do n't know . Zinc or something . Titanium . Or aluminum . " They watched the glowing thing for a while . It settled down onto the meadow . " Should we call someone ? Mark asked . " Who ? " " I do n't know . NASA ? The Weekly World News ? Fox ? " Mary suddenly clutched Mark 's arm . " There 's something moving out there ! " she whispered harshly . " There , in the bushes ! " " Jeez , you 're right ! And it 's coming right toward us . " " It 's clipping plants or something . " " If it keeps coming this way , it 's going to move into the light soon . Yeah ! There ! " " Eeew ! " said Mary . " Look at that thing ! All those spikes and warty knobs sticking out all over it . " " Yeah , and holes of every size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's slippery and gushing weird fluids from its bizarre orifices ! " Mary was breathing hard . " It looks soft and hard all at the same time . Look at it . It 's quivering and pulsating ! I think I can hear an eerie moaning sound ! " She looked at Mark . Mark looked at her . He was breathing hard , too . " I 'll get the baseball bat , " he said . " After I stun it , you got ta help me cany it to the bed . " " Oh , Mark ! Yes ! " Afterward , Mark lay on the bathroom floor , breathing in great gasps . Mary sat in the bathroom sink , although she had no memory of how she had come to be there . The alien quivered and throbbed in the tub . " Oh , God ! " Mary breathed . " Yes , oh yes , " Mark said . " Incredible . " " Better than that . If I could move , I 'd jump right back onto it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken a few bones , but I 'd join you . " Mark turned his head . " Hey , our friend is moaning again . " " It moaned a lot while we were doing it . " " Yeah . It 's starting to flop around , too . You know what ? I think it wants more ! " " More ? " Mary said . " I 'll be too exhausted for anything more strenuous than phone sex for a week ! " " Me too . But I guess he is what he is . Sorry , little guy . I guess it did n't do it for you , huh ?
