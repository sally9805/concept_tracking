Introduction The Silenced Majority // The troops marched slowly up the road , their U.S.-made M-16s in the ready position . It was November 12 , 1991 , a day that would forever be seared into my memory , and into history . I was in Dili , the capital of East Timor , a small island nation 300 miles north of Australia . East Timor had been brutally occupied by Indonesian troops for sixteen years , since they invaded in 1975 . The Indonesian military had sealed off East Timor from the outside world and turned it into their private killing field . A third of the population - 200,000 Timorese - had died . It was one of the worst genocides of the late twentieth century . // I had just attended mass at the main church in Dili with Allan Nairn , journalist and activist , then writing for The New Yorker magazine . After the service , thousands marched toward the Santa Cruz cemetery to remember Sebastian Gomes , yet another young man killed by Indonesian soldiers . The people came from all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They traveled through a geography of pain : In almost every other building , Timorese had been held or tortured , disappeared or killed . Whether it was a police station or a military barracks , a hotel or an officer 's house , no place was beyond reach of the terror . Not even the church was safe . It was about 8 a.m. when we reached the cemetery . // We had asked people along the way : " Why are you marching ? Why are you risking your lives to do this ? " // " I 'm doing it for my mother , " one replied . " I 'm doing it for my father , " said another . " I 'm doing it for freedom . " // In the distance , we heard an eerie , synchronized beat . Suddenly we saw them . Many hundreds of Indonesian troops coming up the road , twelve to fifteen abreast . People grew very quiet . // We knew the Indonesian military had committed many massacres in the past , but never in front of Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd , hoping that our presence could head off what looked like an impending attack . I put on my headphones , took out my tape recorder - I usually kept these hidden so as not to endanger Timorese caught talking to us - and held up my microphone like a flag . Allan put his camera above his head , and we went and stood in the middle of the road , about fifteen yards in front of the crowd . By visibly showing the tools of our trade , we hoped to alert the troops that this time they were being watched . // A hush fell over the Timorese . Those in the back could run , but the thousands of people in front were trapped by the cemetery walls that lined both sides of the road . The main sound was the rhythmic thump of boots hitting the road as the troops marched in unison toward the people . Children whispered behind us . Then , without any warning or provocation , the soldiers rounded the corner , swept past us , raised their U.S.-made weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The troops just kept shooting , moving their guns from left to right , killing anyone still standing . // A group of soldiers surrounded me . They started to shake my microphone in my face as if to say , This is what we do n't want . Then they slammed me to the ground with their rifle butts and started to kick me with their boots . I gasped for breath . Allan threw himself on top of me to protect me from further injury . // The soldiers wielded their M-16s like baseball bats . They slammed them against Allan 's head until they fractured his skull . For a moment , Allan lay in the road in spasm , covered in blood , unable to move . Suddenly , about a dozen soldiers lined up like a firing squad . They put the guns to our heads and screamed , " Politik ! Politik ! " They were accusing us of being involved in politics , a crime clearly punishable by death . They also demanded , " Australia ? Australia ? " // We understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1975 , Indonesian soldiers had executed five Australia-based television journalists in an attempt to cover up a military incursion leading up to the December 7 , 1975 , invasion of East Timor . On December 8 , Australian journalist Roger East , the only other Western reporter left in East Timor , was dragged out of a radio station in Dili down to the harbor and shot . // Almost exactly sixteen years later , as Allan and I lay on the ground surrounded by Indonesian soldiers , we shouted , " No , we 're from America ! " They had stripped us of our possessions , but I still had my passport . I threw it at them . When I regained my breath , I said again , " We 're from America ! America ! " // Finally , the soldiers lowered their guns from our heads . We think it was because we were from the same country their weapons were from . They would have to pay a price for killing us that they never had to pay for killing Timorese. // At least 271 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Santa Cruz massacre . Indonesian troops went on killing for days . It was not even one of the larger massacres in East Timor , and it would n't be the last . It was simply the first to be witnessed by outsiders . // " A Sanctuary for Dissent " // Going to where the silence is . That is the responsibility of a journalist : giving a voice to those who have been forgotten , forsaken , and beaten down by the powerful . It is the best reason I know to carry our pens , cameras , and microphones into our own communities and out to the wider world . // I am a journalist from Pacifica Radio , the only independent media network broadcasting in the United States . It was founded in 1949 by a man named Lew Hill , a pacifist who had refused to fight in World War II . When he came out of a detention camp after the war , he said the United States needed a media outlet that was n't run by corporations profiting from war . His vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - not by " corporations with nothing to tell and everything to sell that are raising our children today , " in the words of journalism professor George Gerbner , founder of the " cultural environment " movement . // KPFA , the first Pacifica station , began in Berkeley , California . FM radio was in its infancy at the time , so KPFA had to make and give out FM radios in order for people to hear the station . As would happen so many times in the decades that followed , Pacifica Radio tried something no one thought would work - building a network based on the financial support of individual listeners . This marked the birth of listener-sponsored media in this country , a model later used by National Public Radio and public television . // The Pacifica network grew to five stations : KPFA in Berkeley , KPFK in Los Angeles , WBAI in New York , WPFW in Washington , and KPFT in Houston . In 1970 , KPFT became the only radio station in the United States to have its transmitter blown up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the KKK 's Grand Wizard claimed that his greatest act " was engineering the bombing of a left-wing radio station , " because he understood how dangerous Pacifica was . // Pacifica is a sanctuary for dissent . In the fifties , when the legendary singer and African-American leader Paul Robeson was whitelisted during Senator Joseph McCarthy 's witch hunts , banned from almost every public space in the United States but for a few black churches , he knew he could go to KPFA and be heard . The great writer James Baldwin , debating Malcolm X about the effectiveness of nonviolent sit-ins in the South , broadcast over the airwaves of WBAI. // Today , Pacifica continues that tradition . My colleagues at WBAI , including Elombe Brath and the late Samori Marksman , have taught me how a local radio station can be the gateway to a rich world . Samori was a pan-Africanist who taught me so much about the history of Africa and the Caribbean . Elombe Brath has long provided a voice for leaders of African liberation movements . These men made the whole world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , S ? kou Tour ? , and Julius Nyerere were local voices to WBAI 's listeners . In his role as WBAI program director , Samori would call me into his office under the pretext of discussing some bureaucratic minutiae . I would emerge three hours later , newly educated about a liberation movement in Africa or the Caribbean . // It 's still much the same . On any given day , you can listen to the news on CNN or National Public Radio , then tune in to a Pacifica station . You would think you were hearing reports from different planets . // We inhabit the same planet , but we see it through different lenses . On community airwaves , color is n't what sports commentators provide , and it is n't the preserve of a " diversity " reporter . We are a cross section of races , ethnicities , and social classes explaining the world we see around us. // Take , for example , my WBAI colleague Errol Maitland . In March 2000 , while he was reporting live from the funeral of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by police - Errol attempted to interview New York City police who were moving in on the crowd of mourners . We listened as he tried to question police , who then threw him to the ground . Errol was beaten by New York City police officers and had to be hospitalized for weeks . When I visited him in the hospital , I found him handcuffed to his bed . All for what ? For reporting while black . // It was stories like Errol 's , in New York and around the world , that my WBAI colleague Bernard White and I took on each day for a decade on the morning show Wake Up Call . We heard people speak for themselves , instead of hearing them defined by officialdom . Bernard , a former New York City schoolteacher , has deep roots in the community . Whether in the classroom , on air , or as Samori 's successor as WBAI program director , Bernard 's idea of education is to have people tell their own stories , document their own lives . // I began hosting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the only daily election show in public broadcasting . Listener response was enormous . Suddenly the daily struggles of ordinary people - workers , immigrants , artists , the employed and the unemployed , those with homes and those without , dissidents , soldiers , people of color - were dignified as news . I call it trickle-up journalism . These are the voices that shape movements - movements that make history . These are people who change the world just as much as generals , bankers , and politicians . They are the mainstream , yet they are ignored by the mainstream media . // After the 1996 election , we decided to continue the show as a daily grassroots political newshour . When the media began beating the drums of war after September 11 , 2001 , Democracy Now ! expanded to television and became the largest public media collaboration in the country . We now broadcast on hundreds of community radio and public access TV stations . We beam out over satellite television and stream on the Internet at www.democracynow.org. // Why has Democracy Now ! grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainstream media around the issues - and the people - that matter most . People are now confronting the most important issues of the millennium : war and peace , life and death . Yet who is shaping the discourse ? Generals , corporate executives , and government officials . // In a media landscape where there are more channels than ever , the lack of any diversity of opinion is breathtaking - and boring . As my colleague Juan Gonzalez often says , " You can surf through hundreds of channels before you realize there is nothing on TV . " In a society where freedom of the press is enshrined in the Constitution , our media largely acts as a megaphone for those in power . // That 's why people are so hungry for independent media - and are starting to make their own . // Muzzling Dissent // Vibrant debate and dissent exist in this country , but you are not reading or hearing about this in the mainstream press . // If you are opposed to war , you are not a fringe minority . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silenced majority . Silenced by the mainstream media . // After 9/11 the media personalities on television - you ca n't call many of them journalists - kept saying that 90 percent of Americans were for war . // Were you ever called and asked your views ? And if you were , what were you asked ? Because if someone called and asked , " Do you believe the killing of innocent civilians should be avenged by the killing of innocent civilians ? " I 'm sure that 90 percent of Americans would say no . We are a compassionate people . But people can not take action if they do n't have accurate information . // Politicians who never met a war they did n't like ( and in the case of Bush , Cheney , and Rumsfeld , never fought in any of them ) began to beat the drums of war after 9/11 . Corporations chimed in , knowing they could make a killing off of killing . And then came the mainstream media to manufacture consent , as Noam Chomsky puts it . // To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who the messengers are . The media watch group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting ( FAIR ) did a study of the " experts " who appeared on-camera on the major network news shows during the critical week before and week after February 5 , 2003 - the day Secretary of State Colin Powell made his case to the UN Security Council for invading Iraq . This was at a time when 61 percent of Americans supported more time for diplomacy and inspections . The FAIR study found only 3 of 393 sources - fewer than 1 percent - were affiliated with antiwar activism. // Three out of almost 400 interviews . And that was on the " respectable " evening news shows of CBS , NBC , ABC , and PBS. // So if you ran to the bathroom while watching TV during that critical two-week period - sorry ! You might have missed the only dissenting viewpoint the network news offered . // This is not a media that is serving a democratic society , where a diversity of views is vital to shaping informed opinions . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing it off as journalism . // Why does it matter ? Well , consider the alternative : Imagine if instead of 3 voices against the war , the networks allowed 200 war skeptics on the air - roughly the proportion of the public opposed to war . // And imagine if the U.S. media showed uncensored , hellish images of war - even for one week . What impact would that have ? I think we would be able to abolish war . // Instead , after our loved ones and neighbors followed orders and marched off to war ( unlike the children of the top warmakers ) , the networks showed us a colorful , video-game version of what was going on . // In Iraq , the U.S. government discouraged independent coverage of the war - sometimes at gunpoint . //
