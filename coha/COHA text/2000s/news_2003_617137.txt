<p> You know things are bad when the big Internet service providers are working together and federal lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are in agreement . <p> But all this togetherness likely wo n't stop the con artists , hackers and run-of-the-mill spammers who swamp the Internet daily with billions of unwanted e-mails . <p> Until now , the war on spam has been fought primarily by Internet service providers with faulty filtering systems and federal regulators scratching for ammunition to stop spammers . In recent weeks , the anti-spam forces at least look more aggressive . <p> President Bush is expected to sign a national anti-spam bill into law today . It authorizes creation of a popular anti-spam registry and provides criminal penalties for faking parts of e-mail , such as sender IDs . <p> But many consumer advocates do n't think much of the legislation , effective Jan. 1 . The registry may not be technologically feasible , and the legislation , heavily influenced by mainstream businesses that market products through e-mail , pre-empts some stronger state measures . <p> " Congress should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta attorney who has sued hundreds of spammers . <p> A coalition of a half-dozen major Internet providers , fierce competitors who aligned last spring to combat spam , is expected to announce its proposals soon . Those likely will include a system to identify bulk e-mailers and certify legitimate ones . That wo n't cut the volume of spam flooding user inboxes , consumer groups say . <p> These are catch-up efforts , frenetic reactions to a problem no one foresaw , including Internet companies that were too busy building their networks and gaining market share to recognize the warning signs , industry experts say . No one else saw the signs , either . <p> " I do n't think anybody , even those of us who are professionally paranoid about spam , thought it was going to get this bad this quickly , " said John Mozena , co-founder of the Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email , an advocacy group . " AOL is now blocking more spam than they are delivering legitimate messages . That is a galactic technical and social problem to deal with . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will take aggressive action and marked improvement on many fronts , including legislation , law enforcement and technology . <p> Consumers must step up , too , and get comfortable with anti-spam technology . Only about one-third of e-mail users with personal accounts have their own filters , according to the Pew Internet &; American Life Project study . <p> " They 've got to be looking left and right on the superhighway , doing the things they can do to protect themselves , " said Orson Swindle , a member of the Federal Trade Commission , the federal agency leading the war on spam . <p> Even with the toughest laws and smartest consumers , " that does n't mean spam will go away  --  it will be manageable , " said Paul Judge , founder of the Anti-Spam Research Group , an international consortium of technologists , Internet providers and software makers . <p> " I am optimistic because there are so many smart , talented people working on the problem , " said Judge , who also is chief technology officer for CipherTrust , an Alpharetta-based company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are having to respond in desperate ways . We definitely have got them out of their comfort zone . " <p> There is still room for pessimism in his world view . Spammers who survive will be the most technologically savvy and criminally bent  --  in Judge 's words , the " smart scum . " <p> Consumer groups miffed <p> Consumer groups have been lobbying for a national anti-spam law for six years . Now that they have one , they are n't happy . <p> " As it stands , it fails the most basic test for any anti-spam law , which is telling people not to spam , " Mozena said . " It does n't say do n't spam . It just regulates how to spam . " <p> The legislation , backed by the Direct Marketing Association and Internet providers , offers some added protections for consumers , especially those in the minority of states without anti-spam laws , including Georgia . <p> " We are not going to support any legislation that makes it easy on spammers or does n't have any guts to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of law and public policy . <p> But the federal legislation weakens tougher measures in other states . <p> California 's " opt-in " law , scheduled to take effect Jan. 1 , would have required that companies get consumers ' permission before sending any e-mail . By contrast , the federal legislation requires senders of unsolicited e-mail to include their return addresses , giving recipients a mechanism for " opting out " of subsequent e-mails . <p> It has created a paradox of sorts . The law requires junk e-mailers to honor requests to be removed from a mailing list . But the time-honored wisdom of the Web has been to avoid the " opt-out " link since any answer  --  in the hands of an unethical marketer  --  validates the address and makes it more likely to receive spam . <p> Business interests say opting in slows the growth of e-commerce , while consumer advocates say opting out sanctions spamming . <p> The advocates dub the " Can-Spam Act "  --  Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003  --  the " I Can Spam Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sole consideration in the legislation . " In reality , in Washington , D.C. , more often than not those with the big bucks get heard . " <p> Swindle and other FTC officials have questioned another key provision  --  the " do-not-spam " registry . Congress wants the FTC to oversee the creation of one if the agency can ensure that hackers wo n't be able to mine it for e-mail addresses to spam . <p> But the idea is riddled with problems , FTC officials say . Spammers can mask their identities , making enforcement next to impossible . Since e-mail users change addresses and Internet providers often , they say , the registry ca n't be kept current . <p> " Very likely , we can design some kind of a do-not-spam registry , but whether it will be effective is highly questionable , " Swindle said . " Sometimes no legislation is better than bad legislation . This is a piece of bad legislation . " <p> Lawsuit filed <p> Promising big returns on bogus investments , Tennessee spammer K.C. Smith used hijacked computers , disposable cellphones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than $100,000 . <p> In May , the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Smith . The Department of Justice then prosecuted Smith , 21 , who was sentenced to 14 months in prison . <p> " K.C. Smith is the best example of someone who really took steps to conceal himself but we tracked him down , " said John Reed Stark , head of the SEC 's Office of Internet Enforcement . <p> But Smith is the exception , not the rule , federal authorities acknowledge . <p> Whether spam itself is illegal  --  and some think it already is under trespass laws  --  myriad other crimes are committed on the Internet , including theft , fraud and stock manipulation . Law enforcement agencies have stepped up their efforts against spammers who commit such crimes . <p> Last month the U.S. Department of Justice , working with federal , state and international agencies , touted the arrests or convictions of 125 people , including Smith , in a nationwide crackdown on online crime . <p> But law enforcement authorities say these successes represent only a small fraction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identifying the spammers . <p> In February 2002 , the Federal Trade Commission declared the investigation of fraudulent and deceptive spam a priority and has since filed 57 law enforcement actions  --  " a trickle " compared with the number of spammers breaking the law , said FTC attorney Brian Huseman . <p> By contrast , the SEC claims " there has n't been anyone , when we 've wanted to , that we have n't been able to track down , " Stark said . " The reality is , in the securities fraud context , spam helps you to get caught . In addition to the online footprints spammers leave , we can trace money . We can trace trading . " <p> Until recently , no one has coordinated the efforts of the many federal agencies investigating spam abuse . That 's changing , said Dan Larkin , unit chief at the FBI 's Internet Fraud Complaint Center , which will serve as virtual quarterback for law enforcement in cyberspace . <p> Even more dramatic changes are in the wings . In a break with tradition , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses skilled at tracking online offenders . The first trial using one of these teams is under way . <p> " We definitely need more manpower ... but not just people with badges , " Larkin said . <p> As more countries develop their pipelines to the Internet , U.S. law enforcement is being presented with a whole new set of challenges . Spam is not confined to the United States . <p> " One thing about e-mail is that it can be sent for a very low cost from anywhere in the world , to anyone in the world , " Huseman said . <p> Technology sought <p> The best hope for combatting spam , industry experts say , is whiz-bang technology . None is on the horizon . <p> Internet experts say there must be technical changes to the e-mail architecture to fix the flaw that makes spammers so hard to catch : Anyone who sends a message can do so anonymously . <p> There 's some talk of rebuilding the Internet from scratch to plug security holes . But most experts think progress can come from less-radical changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something called a trusted sender program  --  a kind of electronic passport for businesses or groups that send out mass mailings . E-mails from " trusted " bulk mailers will be coded to zip through the network . The rest , presumably from spammers , will be waylaid . <p> " The general idea is to identify legitimate e-mail so it can get through , " said Stephanie Fossan , a senior product manager for EarthLink and part of the alliance . " You can then tighten down on some of the mail that is left over . " <p> Some consumer advocates say the system wo n't do enough , in part because Internet providers are cautious when they filter or block e-mail , fearful they will snag e-mail that subscribers want . <p> For now , Internet companies are giving subscribers new tools to block spam while the best technological minds in the world wrangle over how to fix the Internet . <p> " No new law is going to take care of that , " Swindle said . <p> " We are going to have to solve it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " SUNDAY : <p> * Mom and pop spammers . <p> * Fighting child porn is FBI 's first priority .
