The Black Eyed Peas The E.N.D . ( Energy Never Dies ) 3 stars DANCE/HIP-HOP After the successful launch of Fergie 's solo career , the Black Eyed Peas show that there is still strength in numbers on this hump-shaking follow-up to 2005 's multiplatinum Monkey Business . If you had to pick an MVPea here , though , it would be will.i.am , who redeems himself after 2007 's disappointing solo foray , Songs About Girls . Serving as chief producer , Will pumps the energy of underground clubs into this disc with a fresh infusion of electro beats on tracks like the No. 1 single " Boom Boom Pow " and " Rock That Body , " which samples Rob Base &; DJ E-Z Rock 's rap classic " It Takes Two . " DOWNLOAD THIS : " Imma Be , " a funky , futuristic tempo-shifter Elvis Costello Secret , Profane &; Sugarcane 3 stars ROOTS POP It would be a mistake to think that Elvis Costello is hopping on the T Bone Burnett bandwagon by working with the producer who led Robert Plant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Raising Sand . In fact , Costello and Burnett teamed on King of America and Spike , and they make a rootsy-good twosome here . Highlights include " Complicated Shadows , " which Costello first wrote for Johnny Cash , and " The Crooked Line , " with Emmylou Harris on harmony vocals . DOWNLOAD THIS : " I Felt the Chill , " a wistful , waltzy ballad co-written by Loretta Lynn Electrik Red How to Be a Lady , Volume 1 2 stars R &B; If you 're still waiting for another R &B; girl group to fill Destiny 's Child 's pumps , this is n't it . Despite writing and production from The-Dream and Christopher " Tricky " Stewart -- the hitmaking team behind Beyonc 's " Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) "  - -  Electrik Red fails to generate enough sparks on this debut . Hip-hop-inflected tracks such as " P Is for Power " and " W.F.Y. " are laughably lewd , making the Pussycat Dolls look like the real ladies . DOWNLOAD THIS : " So Good , " the Princely single ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 stars ALT-POP Mozart himself would surely find the synth-pop on this French quartet 's fourth studio album to be trs cool . Breezy and bouncy , Phoenix takes you for a dreamy ride on tracks that hark back to the ' 80s while glistening with a modern electro sheen . The disc loses a little momentum with the instrumental atmospherics of " Love Like a Sunset Part I " and its vocal-infused conclusion , " Love Like a Sunset Part II , " but the blissful hooks of songs like " Lasso " quickly rope you in again .

Also from the dark side are tales of serial killers and child-molesting stepfathers , with Dr. Dre back supplying the menacing beats . 3 stars BEN HARPER AND RELENTLESS7 White Lies for Dark Times A new backup band seems to have energized Harper , from the Hendrixian rock of " Keep It Together ( So I Can Fall Apart ) " to the Stonesy soul of " Lay There &; Hate Me.

THE 5 DEFFEST ALBUMS * As the rapper-actor , 35 , releases his fourth solo CD , The Ecstatic , he tells why these discs were cool inspirations. 1 CHARLES MINGUS , THE BLACK SAINT AND THE SINNER LADY It 's raw and elegant , huge music . As a teenager I thought jazz was hip , cool , smart . I was interested in the heroes of jazz . I just related to those guys . 2 DE LA SOUL , 3 FEET HIGH AND RISING De La Soul is easily my biggest influence as far as hip-hop . They made it cool to be who you are . There was a place for outsiders . I was really excited to belong to this culture . 3 MARVIN GAYE , WHAT 'S GOING ON Important songs that feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time . 4 JIMI HENDRIX , BAND OF GYPSYS I was 14 , 15 , and had never heard rock and roll like that .
