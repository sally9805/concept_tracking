Could some of the 118 Russian sailors who died in the August 2000 Kursk submarine disaster have been saved ? A high-level Russian source tells TIME they could have been if rescue gear aboard the ship had ever been tested . After an explosion in the ship 's torpedo room ripped open the hull , 23 surviving crewmen rushed to a floating rescue capsule located in the rear of the submarine . But the capsule failed to disengage and surface . Russian investigators looking into the disaster have been vague about the reasons for the failure . But TIME 's source says that " on orders from the very top , " the capsule was one of several pieces of equipment struck from the testing roster because the ship 's completion was so far behind schedule . <P> In Russia such decisions are commonplace : bridges , houses , factories and other structures are frequently rushed into service to meet deadlines without proper testing . But rarely does the practice have such tragic consequences . And yet it does n't seem that any lesson was learned . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kursk disaster , Russian President Vladimir Putin commissioned another nuclear submarine , the Gepard . According to TIME 's source , that vessel 's floating capsule had never been tested either .  --  By Yuri Zarakhovich
