THE GREEN ZONE <p> BAGHDAD , IRAQ <p> It was just a matter of waiting . Juba was good at waiting . Patience was an important tool for him , as it is for all snipers . The Iraqi desert sun baked and parched him , but his soul remained calm , soothed by the instructions of his two fathers and the sure knowledge that the hunt was on . Once again , he was the sword of the Prophet . God is great ! he whispered , feeling guilty for breaking his oath and speaking the words of praise . <p> He had been in the hole for three days , shaded only by a few bushes during the hottest part of the blistering afternoons . He let his face and neck become sunburned and measured his rations carefully , eating and drinking only enough to survive . The last chocolates from his field rations had been eaten , and he had intentionally drained the last water from his canteens the previous day . He was hungry , and thirst clawed at his throat . Good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard sporadic traffic passing unseen only fifty meters away and the occasional boom of an explosion somewhere down the track . Each morning an American patrol rolled past , clouds of dust following the big vehicles . He could have gotten help anytime he wanted it . Did n't want it . <p> On the fourth morning , the sun was up and the temperature was climbing when he saw the faraway dust clouds kicked up by the oncoming patrol . No wonder they were so easy to ambush . He crawled from the hide , brushed away the signs of his stay by brooming the area with a bush , and staggered to the road . The vehicles now could be seen with the naked eye , which meant they could see him , too , a wobbling soldier alone in the desert . <p> He held up his hands as if in surrender to the first Bradley Fighting Vehicle that approached , with its .50 caliber machine gun trained on him . Then he collapsed . A lieutenant of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division instantly recognized the disruptive pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jumped down to help . They pulled him into the shade of the big vehicle . <p> Sweat caked the dusty face and dirt clung to the filthy uniform , and when they started pouring some water into his mouth , he greedily grabbed for the canteen . The American pulled it back . " Easy , pal . Just a little bit at a time . You 're gon na be okay . " He offered another sip . A medic smoothed a wet salve on the sunburned face , neck , and hands . Juba slowly responded in a British accent , haltingly explaining that his sniper team had been discovered a week ago and his spotter killed in the ensuing fight . The Englishman had evaded the searching insurgents , found this road before dawn today , and walked next to it since then , hoping that a friendly force would spot him before the insurgents did . The Americans were unaware that his uniform and the rifle hanging from his shoulder had been stripped from a British soldier he had killed outside of Basra . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helicopter arrived , and he thanked the American soldiers and climbed into the bird . Within thirty minutes , it delivered him to the landing pad of a military hospital inside the Green Zone of Baghdad . A stretcher team met him , but he waved them off , and they led him into a cool corridor , then into a big room where other soldiers lay on cots . A nurse helped him remove his tunic and stuck a needle into his arm to start a slow drip of hydrating fluids . He had been outside in the heat for so long that the fresh liquid going directly into his veins , plus the air-conditioning , caused a deep and instant chill , and he began to shake as if he were freezing . The nurse recognized the reaction as normal and wrapped a blanket around his shoulders as a doctor came over to check him . Exhaustion , sunburn , and dehydration , but no wounds . Juba lay back on the cot , enjoying the brief rest and the air-conditioning . <p> As the IV drip was finishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having already notified British commanders that their man had been rescued . " They thought you were dead , " said the captain , settling into a chair . He thought the guy looked like hell . " So what happened out there , Sergeant ? " <p> The officer took a few notes as Juba repeated his tale of a mission gone wrong . " Sorry about your buddy , " the American said and put away the notebook . " Bad shit . " <p> " Part of the job , mate . " Juba sighed and leaned back on the green sheet of the metal-framed cot . <p> " Your instructions are to rest up and then return to your unit as soon as medically fit , " said the captain . <p> The busy doctor in uniform came by just long enough to look him over for a final time and remove the needle . " I 've signed your discharge slip , Sergeant . You 're going to be fine except for a few aches and pains and that sunburn . Drink a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the burn , and if you need more , just come by the pharmacy . You want something to help you sleep tonight ? " " No , sir . I 've dealt with worse than this . " <p> " Okay , then . You 're free to leave . Good luck . " <p> The intel officer was still there . " Come on with me , soldier , and I 'll take you over to the mess hall , then give you a chit for a bed tonight in the guest quarters . Your orders from British HQ are to rest up and then report back to your unit . Meanwhile , you 're a guest of Uncle Sam . " Juba pushed himself from the cot , acting wobbly , then drew himself erect and stretched , turning side to side . The body was lean and muscular . He put on his tunic . " Thank you , sir , but I plan something a little more upscale . I 'm going to get a hotel room , raid the minibar , take a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two days . " " I hear ya , " said the officer . " I 've got everything I need . Stay safe . " He waved Juba through the door . The sniper ducked into a bathroom , locked himself into a stall , dropped his trousers to retrieve some documents from a plastic bag that had been tucked just above his right boot , and put them in his shirt pocket . He came out , signed for his rifle at the makeshift armory , and left the hospital . Back on the hunt . Closer than before . <p> He took his time crossing the military areas of the Green Zone as he made his way over to the new Nineveh Hotel , a five-star , four-hundredroom edifice that offered safety , opulence , an indoor Olympic-sized swimming pool , a gourmet restaurant , and other luxury conveniences to foreign visitors , diplomats , and business executives . The gleaming signature spire and a communication array on the roof made it the tallest building in Baghdad . <p> Despite the outward appearances of commerce , Baghdad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange at all when Juba unfolded the papers that he had carried in the plastic bag and handed them to the concierge of the Nineveh . The documents allowed him to commandeer the corner suite on the twelfth floor for an unspecified " military necessity , " the code that unlocked any door in the city . The civilian led him to the suite and joked during the elevator ride about how things were improving . Soft music played in the background . <p> Juba thanked him , locked the door , and dumped his gear and clothes . He showered , shaved , cleaned his uniform , and put it back on . He snatched three pillows from the bed , piled them on the small dining table in the center of the suite , and stacked his pack atop them to provide a solid support for the long rifle . Crawling on his knees , then his stomach , he moved to the sliding glass door that led onto the balcony and pushed it open by a narrow six inches . Then he wiggled back about seven feet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat front garden with lawns of grass that was irrigated to a deep lush green . <p> Juba lifted his L115A1 long-range rifle , made by Accuracy International UK , the standard weapon of a British sniper . It fired a .338 Lapua Magnum round that was accurate up to 1,100 meters , and it had a Killflash silencer on the muzzle and a bipod . He had zeroed the weapon two days ago and was confident it would hold enough for the task today . From his position , he could see the outside world , but no one on the ground could see him . <p> Juba had exchanged the standard Schmidt &amp; Bender PM II telescopic sight for the better Zeiss version used by the Germans , and he peered through it to examine the foot traffic along the pathways . A wolf eyeing a flock of sheep . The people below seemed startlingly close through the clear optics . The first potential target to stroll through his kill zone was a civilian wearing a loud Hawaiian shirt and tan trousers . Too easy : a foreign contractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission today . It had to be the man with the secret . Sooner or later , he would come along , if the intelligence was correct . Juba would wait . He knew how to wait . <p> He put down the rifle , sat in a soft chair , and flipped through the English-language newspaper that had been delivered free to the hotel room and checked the football scores to see if Manchester United had won . He sipped chilled water from a plastic bottle . Scorching outside air oozed through the slightly opened door and did battle with the room 's buzzing air conditioner . The flat-screen color television set mounted in the wall was on , and he adjusted the volume slightly to the loud side . News readers rattled on about next week 's royal wedding in London , elevating the event steadily so that by Tuesday , the marriage of the prince and his girlfriend would be considered the most important thing in the world . Millions of people would watch . As a British subject , he vividly remembered the legends of the glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into him as a student and later as a soldier defending the Crown . He planned to be there for the wedding . <p> Juba was slightly under six feet in height and slender at 170 pounds , with the fair hair of his British mother and the dark eyes of his Arab father . His skin was several shades darker than the normal Briton , more of a nice California tan that had been darkened even more by his work in the desert . It helped him move with ease in the twilight gulf between Christians and Muslims . Juba could be anybody he wanted to be , and for the past few days , he had again chosen the familiar role of a British Army sniper . It was his best disguise , because he once had been awarded the coveted sniper 's patch of two crossed rifles with an S between the barrels . <p> After reading the sports in the newspaper , he put his eye back to the scope and considered the next possible target , an approaching soldier who , despite the midday heat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once been the safest place in Iraq , the International Zone , home of the giant U.S. Embassy . It once had been known as the Green Zone , and although bureaucrats changed the name to better claim that the war was the effort of many nations , the Green Zone name stuck . Juba was tempted by the soldier , for he always enjoyed the challenge of placing a bullet in the small gaps of the armored vests or between the ceramic plates . Not the mission : Let him pass . <p> An hour before sundown , four soldiers in full armor appeared , moving in a box formation as they escorted a smaller man toward the Coalition Headquarters building where the first formal interrogation was to take place . The soldier on the left front corner was talking and making sharp , descriptive motions with one hand , probably an officer directing the prisoner transfer . Except that the man was not a prisoner , more a valuable guest of the Coalition . He had arrived yesterday in Baghdad , with the secret locked in his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans and the British officials , but he had made too many mistakes in escaping from the laboratory in Iran . The biggest error was in trusting his coworkers , who were able to provide almost a minute-by-minute schedule for the defector . Then Juba had been summoned . <p> The traitor could not be allowed to reach the interrogation room alive . Juba pressed his cheek into the cool stock , his fingers roving with familiarity over the rifle to make sure it was ready . They were three hundred yards away , and he checked the flags on the government building . He estimated the wind at seven to ten miles per hour full value , right to left , which would move the fired round two inches to the left at two hundred yards . He adjusted the scope to compensate . Humidity was zero . <p> He settled the scope on the officer and looked for a weakness . The waving arm ! The officer was describing something , and his right arm windmilled to make his point . Juba exhaled and let his heartbeat slow almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . <p> At two hundred yards , almost point-blank range , he squeezed the trigger back , slow and steady and straight , just as the American raised his arm above shoulder level . The big rifle fired , and the Killflash ate up the noise as the bullet entered beneath the right armpit of the officer , smashed down through the rib cage and exited out of his lower left side , crushing bones and shredding every organ in its path . The officer died before anyone could reach out to help him . <p> Juba accepted the light recoil and cycled another round into the chamber as the startled group stopped in its tracks . He brought his scope to the small man in the middle . They had heard nothing , but the colonel had just been shot ! The soldiers spun around , looking for the threat but leaving the target uncovered . The Iraqi automatically bent down , turning to aid the fallen American . That exposed the left rear side of his neck , and Juba centered the crosshairs right there and pulled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail of the bullet , which impacted right below the base of the skull and ripped out the throat when it came out the other side . Two catastrophic kills . <p> Juba put aside the rifle , ducked down to the floor , crawled forward , and reached up to slowly close the door to the outside patio . He went back , retrieved his kit and the rifle , tossed the pillows back onto the bed , and left the room . <p> He increased his pace through the lobby and hurried outside with other armed soldiers and civilian private security company guards who were moving into the attack area . A Quick Reaction Force would arrive within minutes , and uniformed men would be all over the place , with all sorts of weapons pointing everywhere , and Juba would be just another soldier with a gun . He made his way through the crowd and walked out of the Green Zone unmolested . <p> That evening , a small Royal Jordanian Airlines Fokker plane took off on schedule from the Baghdad International Airport . On its manifest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark eyes . <p> Juba was going to London . <p> The secret that Saddam Hussein had taken to his grave remained safe . The Palace of Death was secure . <p> Excerpted from Dead Shot by Jack Coughlin . <p> Copyright 2009 by Jack Coughlin . <p> Published in March 2009 by St. Martin 's
