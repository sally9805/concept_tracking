<p> Baseball has a money problem . The rich get richer , and the rest scuffle to get by . <p> And it is not just the 30 teams that are faced with that challenge . <p> The revenue gap between teams is the focal point of negotiations on baseball 's new basic agreement . There is , however , a growing gap among the players , something that the Major League Baseball Players Association has shown no interest in adjusting . <p> Teams have committed 79 percent of their payrolls for 2002 to 30 percent of the players  --  39 percent to the top 10 percent of the players . Meanwhile , the bottom 30 percent of the players account for only 4 percent of the payroll committed for 2002  --  1 percent for the bottom 10 percent . <p> The Colorado Rockies , for example , project to have slightly more than $50 million in base salaries for their 25-man Opening Day roster , and $33 million of that will go to four players  --  Larry Walker ( $12.5 million ) , Mike Hampton ( $8.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Todd Helton ( $5 million ) . <p> The Rockies will pay only one other player more than the major-league average salary of last season  --  Todd Hollandsworth ( $2.5 million ) . While Todd Zeile is guaranteed $6 million , the Rockies are obligated for only $2.5 million of that and were able to push $500,000 into their 2003 budget by turning it into a buyout on an option on 2003 when Zeile agreed to rework his contract . <p> How wide is the gap ? <p> Alex Rodriguez has a $21 million base salary in 2002 , the second year of the record-setting 10-year , $252 million deal that Texas gave him before last season . That 's more than $2 million more than the 30 teams combined have committed to the bottom 10 percent of the players . <p> The average major-league salary reached a record $2,138,896 in 2001 , an increase of slightly more than $800,000 over five years . Team averages ranged from the $3,930,334 of the New York Yankees to the $926,333 of the Montreal Expos . <p> But more than an overall distribution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major revenue-sharing plan for baseball , which in theory , at least , would mean a more even distribution of payroll among MLBPA membership . <p> The teams split 20 percent of local revenue in the basic agreement that expired at the end of the World Series . The owners have proposed increasing that to 50 percent . So far the players have endorsed a minimal increase to 22.5 percent . <p> The owners have proposed including a minimum payroll for teams that receive funds from the revenue-sharing pool , but the MLBPA previously opposed that idea . <p> Why ? Because the more money top revenue-producing teams have to share , the less they will have available for their own use to bid up the top salaries . <p> While a majority of the players do n't care for the designated hitter in theory , the MLBPA has fought the idea of eliminating the designated hitter because it is a high-salaried position . The average salary for a DH in 2001 was $5,650,019 , tops of any position in baseball . First basemen were second , more than $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were only six players who appeared in 80 or more games as a DH . And only five of the six were signed to be DHs . When Boston gave Manny Ramirez an eight-year , $160 million contract before last season it was with the expectation he would play the outfield . A nagging hamstring problem limited him to 55 games in the field in 2001 . <p> Meanwhile , there were 24 players who appeared in 100 or more games at first base . <p> As for the argument that the DH allows aging greats to stay in the game so fans get a chance to see them a final time , the six players with 80 or more games at DH last year were Ramirez , Edgar Martinez of Seattle , Ellis Burks of Cleveland , Brad Fullmer of Toronto , David Justice of the New York Yankees and David Ortiz of Minnesota . <p> Scripps Howard News Service <p> FIGHTING FOR A JOB : Though David Wells has a two-year , $7 million contract with the New York Yankees , he does n't have a guaranteed spot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game for the Yankees in 1998 , is battling Sterling Hitchcock and Orlando Hernandez for one of the two open spots in the rotation . <p> While Wells has bragged about the 30 pounds he says he lost since the last time he wore a White Sox uniform , manager Joe Torre is more interested in the shape of Wells ' back . The left-hander who turns 39 on May 20 underwent surgery to repair two herniated discs last July . <p> He had a very serious operation , " Torre said . That 's what I 'm more anxious to see the result of than the diet or the workout regimen . It is the ability to go out on the mound and be able to stay on the mound and pitch effectively . I 've cut a lot of guys who were in pretty good shape . " <p> Before owner George Steinbrenner convinced Wells to renege on a verbal agreement with the Arizona Diamondbacks , the pitcher had to sit down and clear the air with Torre earlier this winter . Wells ripped Torre last spring . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We hashed it out and we 're fine . " <p> Torre said they had a falling-out after a game in Texas during the 1998 season , when Wells complained he was pulled too early from a start . <p> We talked , " Torre said.I gave a little . He gave a little . We 're fine . " <p> BALANCING THE BOOKS : Steve Schott , managing general partner of the Oakland Athletics , took an obvious shot at the world-champion Diamondbacks in an interview last week with the San Francisco Chronicle . <p> Defending the A 's commitment to the bottom line , Schott said : <p> There 's one franchise , it 's kind of pathetic . They wanted a franchise and got one . Congratulations . But I would n't want to be arguing with my partners about how I 'd have to go out and get an extra $150 million , dilute the interests and lose 40-some million dollars . <p> We could do that , too . And maybe we could win a World Series like they did . But that 's not our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already have Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling and now they are looking to add Hall of Fame left-hander Steve Carlton . <p> Manager Bob Brenly said Carlton might join the team as a consultant when Cactus League play begins March 1 . <p> He has obligations the first few weeks of camp , but when the games start , he thinks there may be a possibility for him to come in here for a week , or a few days , " Brenly said . Certainly , that 's something we want to take advantage of , his experience and his knowledge of the game . " <p> STARTING OVER : JIM TRACY is entering his second full season as manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers , but he is expecting this to be his first real spring training . He was a little distracted last year with the almost daily outbursts from slugger Gary Sheffield . <p> This is going to be fun , it 's going to be refreshing , " Tracy told the Los Angeles Times . I missed out last year on enjoying the whole sphere of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to challenges when they surface ; unfortunately , mine came even before I put my uniform on . " <p> FRESH START : Right-hander Kip Wells , traded from the White Sox in the Todd Ritchie deal , could be the Pittsburgh Pirates ' Opening Day starter . <p> I relish the opportunity , " Wells said . I feel like it is a good opportunity for me . But if it 's not me then I feel like whoever it is will beat me out for it . " <p> HIGH , HARD ONES <p> MOVING ON <p> Jay Buhner , Mariners : The recently retired slugger , who is expected to step into the Mariners ' radio booth this summer , said he is flattered by talk Seattle will retire his No. 19 , but he first wants to see No. 24 retired in honor of former teammate Ken Griffey Jr . <p> HANGING ON <p> Rickey Henderson , Red Sox : It should n't be a surprise the veteran outfielder signed with Boston . New Red Sox president Larry Lucchino was also the driving force in the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Padres , who previously employed Lucchino as their club president . <p> HOLDING ON <p> Tony Gwynn , Padres : For the first time in more than two decades , he wo n't be going to spring training with the Padres . I 'm not going to miss spring training , " he said with a laugh . But when Opening Day comes , I ca n't imagine how much I 'm going to miss it that day . That day is going to hit me hard . " <p> 30 <p> The number of years since the Cubs have had back-to-back winning seasons . <p> 4 <p> Number of teams that have drawn more than 3 million fans each of the last six seasons  --  Cleveland , Los Angeles , Baltimore and Colorado . <p> 4 <p> The number of pitchers the Detroit Tigers have signed to multiyear deals this winter  --  Jeff Weaver , Matt Anderson , Danny Patterson and Steve Sparks  --  in an effort by the front office to start creating some roster stability .
