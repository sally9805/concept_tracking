It 's hard to find decent work in a war zone . Just ask Ilyas , 28 , a Kashmiri , father of five and a guide by profession . Ilyas works for Pakistan 's Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence . His job is to smuggle jihadis and their munitions into India 's portion of Kashmir . If he survives the bullets , land mines and mortars that greet him in the freezing no-man's-land between the two countries , the ISI pays him $334 per trip . If not , his family gets his last paycheck . " Every time I leave home , " says Ilyas , " my wife and I say goodbye as if we 're seeing each other for the last time . " <P> Ilyas ' infiltration industry was thrust into the international limelight last week as India and Pakistan seemed to be approaching the brink of war . India holds Pakistan responsible for the Dec. 13 attack on the Indian Parliament because Pakistan supports these infiltrations . Beyond that , India maintains that the ISI actually orchestrates terrorist attacks . According to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the ISI is as directly involved in terrorism  --  including the attack last month  --  as the Indian government claims . <P> Still , there is no doubt that Pakistan is deeply engaged in fomenting the Kashmir insurgency , working in large part through the ISI . The agency is staffed by as many as 100,000 operatives and " assets , " and its operations are regulated by no law . The ISI has long manipulated Pakistan 's internal politics and profoundly influenced its policies on Afghanistan and Kashmir . In the 1980s the agency offered considerable assistance  --  including the dispersal of aid from other countries , notably the U.S.  --  to the Islamic militants in Afghanistan who eventually expelled the occupying Soviet army . <P> The success of that venture inspired Pakistan 's military leaders to start helping insurgents fighting Indian rule in Kashmir , in hopes of equally spectacular dividends . The ISI even has a wing devoted to supporting the Kashmir insurgency . The Pakistani military initially trained indigenous Kashmiri militants , but in 1992  --  after a brutal Indian crackdown almost snuffed the separatist movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their zeal would revive the conflict . <P> It did . And every year of the past decade , hundreds of young militants who have undergone intensive commando training and countless hours of indoctrination by jihadi groups have been picked up in unmarked vehicles from towns around Pakistan-administered Kashmir and ferried to the border . There , after they have had a day or two of rest , military officers have briefed them , handed them rifles , explosives and wads of Indian currency , and introduced them to guides like Ilyas , who lead them to probable death . <P> Yet all is not well on the jihadi front . The terrorism espoused by several militant groups has effectively dirtied a cause even moderate Pakistanis consider sacred . Indigenous Kashmiri militants , for their part , complain privately that Pakistan has hijacked their movement by throwing into the mix extremists alien to their moderate culture . Indeed , the two groups India accuses of masterminding the bombing of its Parliament are dominated by non-Kashmiri zealots , many of them veterans of the Afghan-Soviet war .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
