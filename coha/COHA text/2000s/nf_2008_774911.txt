EARLY DAYS De l'audace , et encore de l'audace , // et toujours de l'audace , et la patrie sera sauv ? e. //  --  Georges Jacques Danton , September 2 , 1792 // Election night in 1964 found me at the local Goldwater for President headquarters in Catonsville , Maryland , just outside Baltimore . I had done volunteer campaign work there during the summer after the Republican Convention , and on weekends . Having obtained permission to be absent from high school on Election Day to hand out Goldwater leaflets at a nearby precinct , I was in Catonsville when Maryland 's polls closed to await the national returns . Although Lyndon Johnson seemed to have a large lead going into the election , I remained optimistic that Barry Goldwater would run well , and might even pull off an upset . // So much for the early signs of a promising political career . Goldwater was crushed , in what was then the worst presidential election defeat in American history . At the Catonsville office , which had become quite crowded , many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ) were weeping , something I had never seen before in public . I was somewhat puzzled by this display of emotion , but I was more puzzled by the election results , which were going from bad to worse . Dean Burch , Goldwater 's chairman of the Republican National Committee , said , " As the sun sets in the West , the Republican star will rise . " I believed that for a while , until it became ever more obvious that " down " was the only direction in which Goldwater was headed . // It took weeks for the extent of the defeat to penetrate fully into my befuddled brain . When a few brave souls , just weeks afterward , printed bumper stickers that read " AuH2O ' 68 , " I was ready to sign up again . After all , the American people could not really vote in overwhelming numbers for a candidate who said things like , " I want y'all to know that the Democratic Party is in favor of a mighty lot of things , and against mighty few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and The Conscience of a Conservative , and fiercely admired the Arizonan 's philosophy and candor . He was an individualist , not a collectivist , who said without reservation , " My aim is not to pass laws , but to repeal them . " 1 He was against " the Eastern Establishment , " which conservatives saw as a major source of our misguided statist policies at home , and what Barry called " drift , deception , and defeat " in the international struggle against Communism . I cheered when Barry said we should cut off the eastern seaboard and let it drift out to sea , even though my own state of Maryland would have been drifting out there as well . Later , after he returned to the Senate , Goldwater began a letter to the CIA director , " Dear Bill : I am pissed off . " ( How many times in my own government career did I long to write a letter like that , although I never did . ) In my heart , I knew Barry was right . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was obviously part of a distinct minority , even though others would bravely say of Goldwater 's popular vote total that " twenty-six million Americans ca n't be wrong . " It would have been entirely logical after 1964 to give up politics as completely hopeless , and go on to a career , say , in the Foreign Service , as I seriously contemplated . Or I might have drifted off to the left in college , as so many of my contemporaries did . But like many others whose first taste of electoral politics came in the Goldwater campaign , I had exactly the opposite reaction . If the sustained and systematic distortion of a fine man 's philosophy could succeed , abetted by every major media outlet in the country , overwhelmingly supported by the elite academic institutions , to the tune of negative advertising like Johnson 's famous " daisy commercial , " which accused Goldwater of being too casual about nuclear war , and slogans like " Goldwater for Halloween , " it was time to fight back . If the United States was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appendectomy scars in public and held up beagles by their ears could get elected president , something had to be done . Surrender was not an option . // Thirty-six years later , election night 2000 was a very different affair . Beginning in 1968 , Republicans had dominated American presidential politics . Only the unfortunate elections of two failed southern governors had intervened , and the objective in 2000 was to prevent the second Democratic interruption from being extended . Unlike 1964 , however , the 2000 election was excruciatingly close , and I did n't stay around to await the outcome . I left for Seoul the morning after the election to participate in a conference on Korea-related policy issues at Yonsei University , which was cohosted by the American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) , where I was senior vice president . When I checked into my hotel in Seoul late on Thursday , Korea time , the Florida outcome remained up in the air . After a long day on Friday , I turned on the television in my hotel room and found that chaos still reigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly for me , Governor George W. Bush had named Jim Baker , my former boss at the State Department during the previous Bush administration , to lead his effort to salvage Florida 's electoral vote . No one at that point had the slightest idea of what might be involved , or how long it would take to decide the evolving contest . Before I collapsed into bed early that Friday evening in Seoul , I left a voice message for Baker at his Houston law firm . I explained that I was in South Korea , but offered to fly to Florida to help . At about 2:00 a.m . Seoul time , the phone rang , and I picked it up to hear Baker 's unmistakable Texas twang saying , " Get your ass on a plane and get back here . " // Just a few days later , I was in West Palm Beach , part of the great " chad " exercise . I stopped first in Tallahassee , but Baker immediately dispatched me to Palm Beach where he thought a " heavyweight lawyer " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ken Mehlman , later Republican Party chairman , called me " the Atticus Finch of Palm Beach County , " but there were many , many people volunteering . Hour after hour we sat , psychoanalyzing ballot cards . This was the process Democrats hoped would produce a change in Florida 's popular vote totals and award them the state 's electoral vote , and therefore the national election . One of my AEI colleagues , Michael Novak , a former Democrat , feared the worst , as he watched on television a battle between " the street fighters and the preppies . " It turned out we won despite our rosy cheeks . I tried to go home for Thanksgiving , but I was called back to Palm Beach just as I arrived in Washington . My family could n't face weeks of eating turkey without me , so I returned ours to the local grocery store on Thanksgiving morning , which was certainly a first for me , and flew back to Palm Beach . On the evening of December 12 , the Supreme Court ended the struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of law , I might add . I was in Baker 's office when he called Texas to tell the candidate the good news , saying to Bush , for the first time legitimately , " Congratulations , Mr. President . " // After more than a month in Florida , one of the great emotional roller-coaster rides of my professional life , I flew back to Washington on a private plane with Margaret Tutwiler , a long-time Baker aide.We agreed it had been a completely different experience from our time in the State Department during the first Bush administration . It was only a matter of time , however , before both of us found ourselves back at the State Department , where Chad was a country in Africa , not a tiny bit of meaningful paper . // Between the 1964 and 2000 elections , a lot had happened to me , demonstrating in my own experience the definition of " history " as " one damned thing after another , " with a few preliminary events before 1964 to get me to that unhappy Goldwater election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 20 , 1948 , a baby boomer by any definition of the term , the son of a Baltimore firefighter , Edward Jackson Bolton ( " Jack " to everyone ) and his " housewife , " as we used to say , from Wilmington , Delaware , Virginia Clara Godfrey , or " Ginny . " Neither had graduated from high school , but I have no doubt that my own academic record was based on the genes I inherited from them , since it certainly did not come from our social contacts or standing in society . All four of my grandparents , who were mostly Scotch-Irish or Irish , emigrated to the United States in the early 1900s , so my parents were first-generation Americans who had grown up during the Depression and been steeled by World War II . They did n't need anyone to tell them that they had been through tough times , and they were determined , like most in their generation , that their children were not going to repeat their experiences . // Jack lied about his age to join the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to sea , not a surprising aspiration for a Baltimore boy , living in the East Coast 's second-largest port after New York . Unfortunately , first assigned to land duty , he made it to sea by dropping a pan of fried eggs on the shoes of an officer who had pushed him a little further than he wanted to go.The ships on which he 'd served looked like big hunks of ice , escorting cargoes across the North Atlantic , or so I thought years later when my father showed me the tiny photographs he 'd kept . Wounded on D-Day off the coast of France , Jack spent the rest of the war recuperating in Florida , tending to the morale of the stateside female population , or at least that 's how he described it . Back in Baltimore , after 1945 , he knocked around for a while , and then got married , starting out as a plumber . The union rules , which resulted in what seemed to him to be endless hours of sitting around , finally prompted him to seek something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wartime experience . He became a firefighter for the city of Baltimore , a decision that did not thrill his wife , Ginny , and certainly did no wonders for the family finances . // Shortly after taking his new job , Jack also decided to register to vote , which he did , listing himself as a Republican . The City Hall clerk , reviewing the registration form , said there must be some mistake because Jack was a city employee , and yet he had registered Republican rather than Democrat . When my father said there was no mistake , the clerk explained to him again that city employees registered as Democrats , which my father was still not buying . The story of my father 's response undoubtedly grew with the telling over the years , but suffice it to say that Jack registered as an Independent , and no fried eggs were dropped on the clerk 's shoes , or worse . // Jack loved being a firefighter , was a good union man , became a shop steward , and held other union offices over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exotic places like Puerto Rico.Make no mistake , he was not a " fireman " ; they were the people who shoveled coal into locomotive engines , which was not his job . Although he was probably unaware of Calvin Coolidge 's suppression of the Boston police strike of 1919 , Jack would have absolutely agreed with Coolidge 's admonition that " there is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody , anywhere , anytime . " Although we all felt that firefighter and police salaries were too low , it was inconceivable to my father that he would ever go out on strike and leave Baltimore 's citizens at risk.When it became fashionable in the 1960s for teachers to strike , he deeply resented it , considering them spoiled for having gone to college and having cushy jobs , which they certainly were compared to his . // We lived for most of my young life , joined by my sister Joni Rae in 1957 , in a southwest Baltimore row-house development called " Yale Heights , " just off Yale Avenue , complete with a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess , can use this to explain my later disinclination to attend Princeton or Harvard.We lived next to a policeman and his family on one side , and a machinist at Westinghouse on the other . Nearby were roofers , bartenders and waitresses , stevedores , and even a few people who worked in offices.To me , Baltimore was a city of industry and manufacturing . I faithfully watched a weekend television program called The Port That Built a City , hosted by Helen Delich Bentley , a newspaper reporter and later a Republican congresswoman , soaking up its explanation of Baltimore 's trading and seafaring connections with the wider world . The city had benefited greatly from institutions like the Enoch Pratt Free Libraries ( which I frequented ) , the Walters Art Gallery , and the Peabody Conservatory , all created by far-seeing individuals , not by the government . // Whereas Jack was naturally a quiet man , who generally kept his opinions to himself , except when agitated by government officials , Ginny was not a quiet woman . She explained to me that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attractive blonde that she was , she 'd also dated du Ponts . Ginny decided that I was not going to be educated forever in Baltimore public schools , which she regarded as inadequate , and she focused on getting me into McDonogh , one of Maryland 's most prestigious private schools , in Reisterstown , just outside Baltimore . // As a sixth grader , I sat for the McDonogh scholarship examination , an event so prominent in Maryland at the time that it was advertised on Baltimore television stations . McDonogh then had an eight-hundred-acre campus , luxurious by my standards , and quite a change from city life . I found the day-long exam somewhat lonely and intimidating , but I passed that round and was called in for interviews . My parents were interviewed as well , which was n't pleasant for Jack , but Ginny was more than happy for an opportunity to sing my praises . My father worked two jobs at the time in order to earn enough income for an adequate living . After fighting fires on the night shift , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not usually in a talkative mood.Our interviews apparently went well , and I was accepted into the seventh grade on scholarship . I spent the next six years at McDonogh as a boarding student , which all scholarship students were at the time , coming home on weekends and for vacations . That 's why being allowed out of school on Election Day 1964 was so special . Not only was I skipping class , I was off campus on a weekday ! // McDonogh had been founded with the legacy of John McDonogh , a Baltimore native who had made a fortune in pre-Civil War New Orleans , and who had divided his wealth between the two cities for the education of the poor.New Orleans used its share to create its public school system , but Baltimore , which already had public schools , and was starting to benefit from the contributions of Pratt , Walters , and Peabody , founded McDonogh in 1873 for orphan boys . So successful was the school that the wealthy wanted their own sons to attend , and paying students were later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes were just under a hundred boys . Typically , between fifteen and twenty boys were on scholarship . McDonogh was a " semimilitary " school , which meant we all wore uniforms and did our share of drilling , but it was not a " military academy " of the southern sort . Two successive headmasters named Lamborn , father and son , were Quakers , and the uniforms originated at McDonogh 's founding when the students did n't arrive with many clothes . Over the years , the uniforms had mitigated the disparity between the sons of the wealthy and those of us on scholarship because there was no opportunity for competition in clothes or other ostentatiousness , as at many other schools . Competition was in the schoolroom , on the athletic fields , and in extracurricular activities , and it was intense . // Indeed , the competition was sufficiently intense that it enabled me to get into Yale College , where I started in the fall of 1966 , still on scholarship . I traveled to New Haven on a Trailways bus because the ever-benevolent Baltimore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive me there himself . Yale was also intense , especially in the late 1960s when anti-Vietnam War sentiment was growing around the country . I was just as much of a libertarian conservative at Yale as I had been in 1964 , and given the prevailing campus political attitudes , I might as well have been a space alien . By senior year , students at Yale and elsewhere had decided that " striking " by not attending classes was an effective way to protest whatever was the flavor-of-the-day political issue . I did n't understand or approve of students ' striking any more than my father had liked teachers ' striking , and I especially resented the sons and daughters of the wealthy , of whom there were many , telling me that I was supposed to , in effect , forfeit my scholarship . I had an education to get , and the protesters could damn well get out of my way as I walked to class . // Yale was filled with extracurricular activities , and I spent a lot of time in the Yale Political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Political Union , founded in the 1930s , was modeled after the Oxford and Cambridge Unions and brought in prominent speakers and held debates during the school year . I joined the Conservative Party and found the opportunity to listen to Republicans from " outside " a welcome relief from Yale 's relentless , smug , self-satisfied liberalism . The highlight for me was a debate between William F. Buckley , Jr. , and Yale 's chaplain , William Sloan Coffin , on the proposition " Resolved : that government has an obligation to promote equality as well as preserve liberty . " Buckley argued the negative , and cleaned the floor with Coffin , although I have to admit that Coffin had the best line of the evening . As he started , Coffin noted that he had been in Yale 's Class of 1949 , and Buckley in the Class of 1950 . " Back then , " said Coffin , " Bill was only a year behind me . " After graduation , at the start of the Cold War , both Buckley and Coffin had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Political Union did have its more frivolous moments . One issue that consumed Yale in the late sixties was whether the college , all male since its founding in 1701 , should become coeducational . This debate may have been more intense than the debate over the Vietnam War , although I doubt the antiwar students would ever admit it , because the outcome could have a profound and immediate impact on our lives . I was against coeducation , thinking instead that Vassar should move to New Haven from Poughkeepsie and join with Yale . Many questioned whether Vassar was up to Yale 's academic standards and I suppose at Vassar they had similar concerns . In time , the Political Union addressed this momentous question in a debate on the proposition " Resolved : that in any Vassar-Yale merger , Yale men will always come out on top . " In an unusual display of open-mindedness ( or perhaps with other motives ) , the Yalies invited Vassar girls to participate in the debate , which drew an especially large crowd at the Political Union 's house on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was Ophelia Bust , surprisingly argued the affirmative of the proposition , basically on the grounds that Yalies had no imagination . I forget who won the debate , but Vassar kept its daisy chains in Poughkeepsie , and Yale went coed in 1969 , making my Class of 1970 the last all-male class to graduate from Yale College . // CISL was a training ground in political maneuvers . Delegates from about twenty Connecticut colleges and universities met every spring in Hartford , the state capital , to pretend they were the two houses of the legislature . The Yale delegation drew largely from the Political Union , across the ideological spectrum . Unlike Union debates , which were about philosophy and policy , our CISL activities were strictly about getting our candidates and those of our allies elected to key offices . I was ultimately the head of the Yale delegation , and was elected Speaker of the House in 1970 , a peculiarity , to say the least , when many college campuses , Yale 's included , were beset with protest movements . // Like many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our delegation meetings were usually pretty boisterous , with no-holds arguing , unlike the more decorous Political Union . One of our traditions was that a delegation member who had made a political mistake had to raise his arms to the heavens in front of the delegation and plead in a loud voice " give me shit , " which the rest of us were happy to do . Our politics were no holds barred as well , as we conspired to build coalitions with other schools to achieve our objectives.We had " seduction squads " to deal with recalcitrant girls ' schools , we bargained relentlessly over political deals , and we were expert at sharp parliamentary practices . In a House committee meeting in Hartford , I once had the contents of an entire bill deleted and replaced without a vote as a " typographical error . " In preparation for our first delegation meeting with new Yalies in 1969 , I called a preliminary meeting of the returning delegates , where we vowed to be a little more refined than usual , so that we would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegation meeting ended , I knew we had succeeded because one of the girls came up to me afterward and said she knew we were trying to be on our best behavior , which she and the other girls appreciated.Nonetheless , she continued , we were all Yalies now , and we should simply be ourselves . The CISL veterans internalized that advice , and followed it at the next delegation meeting . None of the girls returned after that . // The Vietnam War eventually consumed Yale , as it did the entire country . In New Haven in spring 1970 , we also faced the trial of Bobby Seale , a Black Panther accused of murdering Alex Rackley , another Panther . Rackley 's body was found in a swamp near New Haven , his body covered with scars from stubbed-out cigarettes and scalding water poured over him before he died . Thousands of radical protesters and their hangers-on , including the Chicago Seven 's Abbie Hoffman , converged on New Haven to shut Yale down . I felt that all of this activity , which grew more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was completely contrary to the community of free expression that a university should be . At " town hall " meetings in Calhoun College , my residential college , I argued to the liberal Yale faculty that this intolerant radicalism posed an even greater challenge to intellectual freedom than the hated Joe McCarthy in the 1950s.Then , at least , the threat came from outside the university ; this time , the barbarians were inside the gates . Some of the deeply unsettled faculty liberals , who seemed overwhelmed by the scorn and hostility from the generation they had spawned intellectually , responded favorably to my arguments , but most students simply swept them aside . // Apart from the particular issue of Vietnam , the incessant politicization of every aspect of Yale life was the most dangerous consequence of the late sixties . This really was the American version of China 's " Cultural Revolution . " Not as damaging as China 's , it was still pernicious intellectually , with consequences that continue to damage the fabric of American society as the baby boom generation has aged , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Class Day exercise , a traditional part of Yale 's graduation ritual . In 1970 , our Class " leaders " decided that Class Day would be all about Vietnam , rather than about graduation , which I did n't like at all . I liked it even less when I saw the list of speakers , all of whom were from the far left . I protested this imbalance to the organizers , who replied snippily that their program was balanced , because a student who supported Hubert Humphrey for president in 1968 would represent the conservative side . // That was the last straw . These rich kids might enjoy perverting Class Day , but my mother and firefighter father were not coming to their son 's graduation for a political seminar . I shoehorned my way into the Class Day program , determined to have my say , at least to the Class of 1970 's parents , if not to the students . Class Day , like graduation , is held on Yale 's Old Campus where we had all lived as freshmen , before departing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life.There were thousands of people present , the largest audience I had addressed , and as I started my few minutes of remarks , I was greeted by hecklers , the only speaker so graced . I had faced this sort of thing many times from the liberals at Yale , who saw themselves as brave and oppressed dissenters from U.S. national policy , but who could n't stand encountering dissent in their own little sandbox . " What you have over there , " I said , pointing to the hecklers , " is a typical example of liberal ' tolerance . ' " This very Class Day program , I went on , was " a typical example of liberal self-congratulation , " and I called for " an end to the politics of this weekend and a return to the joy and happiness that commencement is supposed to be . " I assured everyone that " the conservative underground is alive and well here ; if we do not make our influence felt , rest assured we will in the real world . " I received a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classmates . Par for the course . Both my mother and my father lived until the mid-1990s , but I never had any doubt they thought my graduating from Yale justified all of the hardships they had been through . // Before graduation , I joined the Maryland National Guard , finding a position by driving from armory to armory in the Baltimore area and signing up on waiting lists until a slot opened up . I had concluded that the Vietnam War was lost , and I made the cold calculation that I was n't going to waste time on a futile struggle . Dying for your country was one thing , but dying to gain territory that antiwar forces in Congress would simply return to the enemy seemed ludicrous to me . Looking back , I am not terribly proud of this calculation , but my World War II veteran father , who still risked his life daily for his fellow citizens as a firefighter , approved of it , and that was good enough for me. // I graduated summa cum laude , and was elected to Phi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially liked the Phi Beta Kappa certificate , which read " for excellence in liberal scholarship , " where the word " liberal " clearly meant the free and open search for knowledge so threatened by the intolerance of the late sixties student radicals . I also assigned it a secret meaning , showing that I had beaten Yale 's liberals at their own game . I was an " intensive " major in political science , and the main requirement was writing a senior essay , mine being on international relations . My opus ( 376 pages ) , on decision-making in the British , French , and American governments during the 1956 Suez Crisis , was sufficiently interesting to others that it won Yale 's James Gordon Bennett Prize for the year 's best essay in international relations . // I went on active duty for training to Fort Polk , Louisiana , where I spent eighteen weeks from July to November 1970 . The highlight was on election night 1970 , after taps , when I listened illegally to the returns on a staticfilled transistor radio . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were national results , including the startling news that Jim Buckley had been elected senator from New York on the Conservative Party line . His more famous brother Bill had run for mayor of New York in 1965 as a Conservative , winning all of about 14 percent of the vote , but after the Goldwater defeat of 1964 , Buckley 's mayoral campaign , quixotic though it was , had been a welcome relief . Now , however , in 1970 , we had his older brother in the Senate , and that promised real conservative intellectual force at the national level . // All of my academic glories were enough to get me into Yale Law School , where I started in 1971 . Ironically , this small professional school had more conservative faculty members  --  three to be precise  --  than all of Yale College . I studied antitrust under Robert Bork , whose then-scorned law-and-economics theories are now the predominant source of antitrust law , an intellectual triumph of stunning proportions in an amazingly short time . I took courses from Ward Bowman , another Chicago School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American law school who was not a lawyer . I was also a research assistant for , and student of , Ralph Winter , later chief judge of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals , yet another member of the law-and-economics school . Only one other student and I considered ourselves real conservatives , although our classmate and good friend , Clarence Thomas , now an outstanding Supreme Court justice , later more than qualified . So few were our numbers that when Bork was named solicitor general , Ralph Winter said the Yale Daily News lead should be , " Yesterday , President Nixon nominated 20 percent of all of the conservatives at Yale Law School to be solicitor general . " I also took constitutional law from Alexander Bickel , which affected me deeply , but Bickel was still a New Deal liberal , not a libertarian as Winter , Bowman , and Bork were at the time . I was never a " big government " conservative , not then , and not now . Both Bill and Hillary Clinton were also then at Yale Law School , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While slogging through law school , I spent the summer of 1972 as a White House intern for Vice President Spiro Agnew , Maryland 's former Republican governor , a political anomaly right there . I had been attracted to Agnew because of his criticism of the Legal Services Program , about which Steve Holzer ( the other conservative Yale Law student ) and I were writing a Note for the Yale Law Journal . In many respects , my job options for that summer represented a career high point , since I had three ideal offers : to go with Agnew , to be Alexander Bickel 's research assistant , or to be an intern at Buckley 's National Review . Showing that my political judgment remained as unerring as when I predicted that Goldwater might win the 1964 election , I chose Agnew , but I never regretted it . He was a kind and humorous man , a real middle American , for all that he was bound up in the Maryland political culture that eventually led to his downfall . // My major activity that summer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liberal wing of the Republican Party to change the formula that allocated delegates among the states at the national nominating conventions . Historically , delegation size was based on Electoral College voting strength , with bonuses for states carried by the preceding GOP presidential candidate . The Ripon Society wanted to award convention delegates based only on each state 's percentage of the national popular vote . Ripon 's formula would enhance the influence of populous states such as New York and Pennsylvania in selecting presidential candidates , even though their electoral votes were most likely to be cast for Democratic nominees . // To most conservatives , the Ripon plan was political suicide , but the liberals hoped to prevail at the Miami convention , by persuading Governor Ronald Reagan to side with them.A big state like California would benefit proportionately from their approach , but Reagan was shrewd enough to see that the broader effect would be to dilute conservative strength in the national party . He kept California aligned with the western and southern states , and the Ripon plan was defeated . After the final vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former chairman of Young Americans for Freedom who had hired me as an Agnew intern . As we were leaving our hotel , we got on the same elevator as Frank Sinatra and his guards . Sinatra asked about us , and when we said we worked for Agnew , one of his great buddies , that was all he needed to hear to invite us to have a beer with him at the hotel bar.As part of the Sinatra entourage , we were whisked right up to the bar , where the three of us each ordered a Budweiser.We did not have an extended conversation with Sinatra , however , because every female in the place rapidly elbowed us aside . // After surviving law school , I became an associate at Covington &amp; Burling , then the largest and one of the most prestigious law firms in Washington . I yearned to join the Nixon administration full-time , but Ralph Winter had wisely advised me to go into private practice first , become a partner in a law firm , and then go into politics . His advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were forced to resign in disgrace , Nixon just days after I started at C&amp;B in August 1974 . Then Ford lost the 1976 election to Carter . Had I been a political appointee in the government , I would have been looking for a job . Having followed Winter 's advice , I was happily ensconced making money as a lawyer and was well situated to endure the long night of the Carter administration . // In fact , I had the best of both worlds , since I spent a large part of 1974-76 working on Buckley v. Valeo , challenging the constitutionality of every major provision of the post-Watergate campaign-finance " reform " legislation . Overreacting to Watergate , as in other laws such as the War Powers Act and the Independent Counsel statute , Congress had set strict contribution and expenditure limits on federal campaigns ; tried to limit drastically " independent expenditures " separate from campaigns ; imposed sweeping reporting and disclosure requirements ; created a system of public financing for presidential elections ; and established a new regulatory body , the Federal Election Commission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why this entire construct violated the First Amendment 's protection of freedom of speech , and we initially hoped President Ford would veto the legislation . Given the weakened state of the Ford presidency and the overwhelming pressure to " reform , " that proved impossible . // Instead , Jim Buckley , on whose Senate staff Dave Keene , my friend from the Agnew internship , worked , decided to challenge the statute 's constitutionality , and enlisted Ralph Winter as the lead counsel . I persuaded Covington &amp; Burling to take the case pro bono , and we set off assembling a broad coalition of plaintiffs to help demonstrate the law 's unfairness as well as its unconstitutionality . Keene had already lined up the New York Civil Liberties Union , which had challenged other statutes purporting to limit independent expenditures , and which probably did n't agree with Buckley on much of anything else . Eugene McCarthy , who had campaigned for the 1968 Democratic presidential nomination as a Vietnam War opponent , and who was running again for president in 1976 as an independent , also joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he knew from his own experience could cripple a dissident political campaign before it could even get started , and he opposed the public funding for presidential campaigns because of the overwhelming advantage such subsidies provided to the two major parties , to the detriment of independent and third-party candidates . Although I had obviously not agreed with McCarthy in 1968 , I grew to admire him immensely for his candor and integrity . He liked to say that the word " reform " should be banished from the English language because it meant everything and therefore nothing , which sounded right to me. // Everyone knew the decision in Buckley v. Valeo could determine the election in 1976 , not to mention the future shape of American politics . Buckley had inserted into the legislation a special provision for expedited judicial review of constitutional challenges , precisely to help facilitate an early answer , one way or another , to avoid the potentially catastrophic consequences of a decision in the middle of the campaign.Ralph and I personally went to federal district court in Washington to file the case on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new law 's effective date , where it received docket number 75-0001 . We were off . Predictably , we were wiped out in the D.C. circuit , where the judges ' liberal instincts prevailed , and we appealed almost the entire decision to the Supreme Court . // There , the Court held a nearly unprecedented four hours of oral argument , rather than the one hour most cases received . Ralph argued against limits on contributions and expenditures , including limits on independent expenditures , fittingly , since he conceived the First Amendment theories underlying our arguments . Opposite him on these issues was Harvard law professor Archibald Cox , former special prosecutor and the very embodiment of the " reform " cause . Under President Nixon 's orders , and after Attorney General Elliott Richardson and Deputy Attorney General Bill Ruckelshaus had resigned , Solicitor General Bork had fired Cox in the " Saturday Night Massacre . " Little known then or now , Richardson and Ruckelshaus felt they had to resign , having committed to do so in their confirmation hearings if they saw any White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed before Watergate was an issue , and had made no such commitment . All three knew that if Bork resigned , the rest of the Justice Department might go , too , provoking an even more serious constitutional crisis . In a pivotal meeting , Richardson said , " You 've got the gun now , Bob . It 's your duty to pull the trigger . " Bork did so to his detriment , as the controversy made Ford afraid to nominate him to the Supreme Court . Instead , Ford selected John Paul Stevens , another Republican mistake that perpetuated our inability to get a sound Supreme Court majority . // For Ralph and me , therefore , Cox had special meaning . Moreover , since this was Ralph 's first Supreme Court argument , I wanted him to be relaxed and his usual jovial self . Just before he rose to begin his argument , I slipped him a note that said , " Go Yale ! Beat Harvard ! " It must have worked because Ralph was superb . The Supreme Court 's decision , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expenditure limits and limits on independent expenditures but upholding contribution limits and public financing . Significantly , the Court also struck down the Federal Election Commission , accepting our argument that vesting the appointment of four of its six voting members in Congress violated the separation of powers doctrine ( and laying the basis for a later decision that invalidated the legislative veto ) . We hoped that by hacking away large portions of the statute , we had made the rest unworkable , but Congress quickly responded by recreating the FEC in a constitutional way , and the still-weakened president Ford signed it into law . Legal scholars will continue to debate for decades who won and who lost in Buckley , but the Supreme Court itself gave its interpretation by ruling that the parties defending the statute had to split fifty-fifty the cost of preparing the record for appeal , which we had initially borne as appellants . That satisfied us , although having the entire sloppy statute declared unconstitutional would have satisfied us more . Ralph later asked me , " How does it feel that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " It was a good question , and one that I never resolved satisfactorily . Truly , after Buckley , it was hard to get as excited about anything else in litigation . // Sadly , Jim Buckley lost in 1976 to Daniel Patrick Moynihan , largely because of the attention and publicity Moynihan justifiably attracted as ambassador to the United Nations . In particular , Moynihan had led our unsuccessful effort against the General Assembly 's 1975 resolution equating Zionism with racism . He had famously torn up the resolution at the General Assembly podium , declaring , " The United States ... does not acknowledge , it will not abide by , it will never acquiesce in this infamous act . " Running in heavily Democratic New York , that was all Moynihan needed to overwhelm Buckley . National Review had named Moynihan as its first " man of the year " in 1975 , but ended the award in 1976 , fearing it had already caused enough trouble . I was despondent on Buckley 's behalf , but had no inkling that my path would later cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas City , hoping that Reagan could seize the nomination from President Ford , it was not to be . Watergate gave the November election to Carter , but proved the wisdom of Ralph 's advice : As long as we were in the political wasteland , I might as well pursue my legal career . For the next several years , I immersed myself in private practice and had some interesting times , such as a Supreme Court case involving New York City 's decision to declare Grand Central Station a landmark . The Penn Central bankruptcy trustees wanted to construct an office tower above it , which was not as outrageous a plan as many thought . The architects had contemplated an office tower in the terminal 's original design , and the building 's architectural structure could accommodate the large tower the Penn Central wanted without significant change . // Nonetheless , as in Buckley , this was another case where the High Minded were on the other side , although this time it was not Archibald Cox but Jackie Kennedy Onassis who was the center of attention.We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the Penn Central asked Dan Gribbon , Covington 's preeminent litigator , to take the appeal to the Supremes , and he in turn asked me to work with him . I thought we had an excellent argument under the Fifth Amendment 's Takings Clause , but we lost 6-3 in the Supreme Court . During my later residence as UN ambassador in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel , just down the street from Grand Central , I walked or drove near the terminal almost every day . Constitutional questions aside , I still think it would look better with an office tower above it . //
