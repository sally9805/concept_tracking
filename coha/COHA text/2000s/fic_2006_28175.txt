Chapter One THE CALL CAME IN while Harry Bosch and his partner , Kiz Rider , were sitting at their desks in the Open-Unsolved Unit , finishing the paperwork on the Matarese filing . The day before , they had spent six hours in a room with Victor Matarese discussing the 1996 murder of a prostitute named Charisse Witherspoon . DNA that had been extracted from semen found in the victim 's throat and stored for ten years had been matched to Matarese . It was a cold hit . His DNA profile had been banked by the DOJ in 2002 after a forcible rape conviction . It had taken another four years before Bosch and Rider came along and reopened the Witherspoon case , pulled the DNA and sent it to the state lab on a blind run . It was a case initially made in the lab . But because Charisse Witherspoon had been an active prostitute the DNA match was not an automatic slam dunk . The DNA could have come from someone who was with her before her killer turned up and hit her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case did n't come down to the science . It came down to the room and what they could get from Matarese . At 8 a.m. they woke him up at the halfway house where he had been placed upon his parole in the rape case and took him to Parker Center . The first five hours in the interview room were grueling . In the sixth hefinally broke and gave it all up , admitting to killing Witherspoon and throwing in three more , all prostitutes he had murdered in South Florida before coming to L.A. When Bosch heard his name called out for line one , he thought it was going to be Miami calling him back . It was n't . " Bosch , " he said after grabbing the phone . " Freddy Olivas . Northeast Division Homicide . I 'm over in Archives looking for a file and they say you 've already got it signed out . " Bosch was silent a moment while his mind dropped out of the Matarese case . Bosch did n't know Olivas but the name sounded familiar . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files went , it was his job to review old cases and look for ways to use forensic advances to solve them . At any given time he and Rider could have as many as twenty-five files from Archives . " I 've pulled a lot of files from Archives , " Bosch said . " Which one are we talking about ? " " Gesto . Marie Gesto . It 's a ' ninety-three case . " Bosch did n't respond right away . He felt his insides tighten . They always did when he thought about Gesto , even thirteen years later . In his mind , he always came up with the image of those clothes folded so neatly on the front seat of her car . " Yeah , I 've got the file . What 's happening ? " He noticed Rider look up from her work as she registered the change in his voice . Their desks were in an alcove and pushed up against one another , so Bosch and Rider faced each other while they worked . " It 's kind of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Relates to an ongoing case I 've got and the prosecutor just wants to review the file . Could I hop on by there and grab it from you ? " " Do you have a suspect , Olivas ? " Olivas did n't answer at first and Bosch jumped in with another question . " Who 's the prosecutor ? " Again no answer . Bosch decided not to give in . " Look , the case is active , Olivas . I 'm working it and have a suspect . If you want to talk to me , then we 'll talk . If you 've got something working , then I am part of it . Otherwise , I 'm busy and you can have a nice day . Okay ? " Bosch was about to hang up when Olivas finally spoke . The friendly tone was gone from his voice . " Tell you what , let me make a phone call , Hotshot . I 'll call you right back . " He hung up without a good-bye . Bosch looked at Rider . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants the file . " " That 's your own case . Who was calling ? " " A guy from Northeast . Freddy Olivas . Know him ? " Rider nodded . " I do n't know him but I 've heard of him . He 's lead on the Raynard Waits case . You know the one . " Now Bosch placed the name . The Waits case was high profile . Olivas probably viewed it as his ticket to the show . The LAPD was broken into nineteen geographic divisions , each with a police station and its own detective bureau . Divisional Homicide units worked the less complicated cases and the positions were viewed as stepping-stones to the elite Robbery-Homicide Division squads working out of the police headquarters at Parker Center . That was the show . And one of those squads was the Open-Unsolved Unit . Bosch knew that if Olivas 's interest in the Gesto file was even remotely tied to the Waits case , then he would jealously guard his position from RHD encroachment . " He did n't say what he has going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must be something . He would n't even tell me which prosecutor he 's working with . " " Ricochet . " " What ? " She said it slower . " Rick O'Shea . He 's on the Waits case . I doubt Olivas has anything else going . They just finished the prelim on that and are heading to trial . " Bosch did n't say anything as he considered the possibilities . Richard " Ricochet " O'Shea ran the Special Prosecutions Section of the DA 's office . He was a hotshot and he was in the process of getting hotter . Following the announcement in the spring that the sitting district attorney had decided against seeking reelection , O'Shea was one of a handful of prosecutors and outside attorneys who filed as candidates for the job . He had come through the primary with the most votes but not quite a majority . The runoff was shaping up as a tighter race but O'Shea still held the inside track . He had the backing of the outgoing DA , knew the office inside and out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won big cases-a seemingly rare attribute in the DA 's office in the last decade . His opponent was named Gabriel Williams . He was an outsider who had credentials as a former prosecutor but he had spent the last two decades in private practice , primarily focusing on civil rights cases . He was black , while O'Shea was white . He was running on the promise of watchdogging and reforming the county 's law enforcement practices . While members of the O'Shea camp did their very best to ridicule Williams 's platform and qualifications for the position of top prosecutor , it was clear that his outsider stance and platform of reform were taking hold in the polls . The gap was closing . Bosch knew what was happening in the Williams-O'Shea campaigns because this year he had been following local elections with an interest he had never exhibited before . In a hotly contested race for a city council seat , he was backing a candidate named Martin Maizel . Maizel was a three-term incumbent who represented a west-side district far from where Bosch lived . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was beholden to big-money interests to the detriment of his own district . Nevertheless , Bosch had contributed generously to his campaign and hoped to see his reelection . His opponent was a former deputy police chief named Irvin R. Irving , and Bosch would do whatever was within his power to see Irving defeated . Like Gabriel Williams , Irving was promising reform and the target of his campaign speeches was always the LAPD . Bosch had clashed numerous times with Irving while he served in the department . He did n't want to see the man sitting on the city council . The election stories and wrap-ups that ran almost daily in the Times had kept Bosch up to date on other contests as well as the Maizel-Irving contest . He knew all about the fight O'Shea was involved in . The prosecutor was in the process of bolstering his candidacy with high-profile advertisements and prosecutions designed to show the value of his experience . A month earlier he had parlayed the preliminary hearing in the Raynard Waits case into daily headlines and top-of-the-broadcast reports . The accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a late-night traffic stop . Officers spied trash bags on the floor of the man 's van with blood leaking from them . A subsequent search found body parts from two women in the bags . If ever there was a safe , slam-bang case for a prosecutor-candidate to use to grab media attention , the Echo Park Bagman case appeared to be it . The catch was that the headlines were now on hold . Waits was bound over for trial at the end of the preliminary hearing and , since it was a death penalty case , that trial and the attendant renewal of headlines were still months off and well after the election . O'Shea needed something new to grab headlines and keep momentum going . Now Bosch had to wonder what the candidate was up to with the Gesto case . " Do you think Gesto could be related to Waits ? " Rider asked . " That name never came up in ' ninety-three , " Bosch said . " Neither did Echo Park . " The phone rang and he quickly picked it up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I help you ? " " Olivas . Bring the file over to the sixteenth floor at eleven o'clock . You 'll meet with Richard O'Shea . You 're in , Hotshot . " " We 'll be there . " " Wait a minute . What 's this we shit ? I said you , you be there with the file . " " I have a partner , Olivas . I 'll be with her . " Bosch hung up without a good-bye . He looked across at Rider . " We 're in at eleven . " " What about Matarese ? " " We 'll figure it out . " He thought about things for a few moments , then got up and went to the locked filing cabinet behind his desk . He pulled the Gesto file and brought it back to his spot . Since returning to the job from retirement the year before , he had checked the file out of Archives three different times . Each time , he read through it , made some calls and visits and talked to a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteen years before . Rider knew about the case and what it meant to him . She gave him the space to work it when they had nothing else pressing . But nothing came of the effort . There was no DNA , no fingerprints , no lead on Gesto 's whereabouts-though to him there still was no doubt that she was dead-and no solid lead to her abductor . Bosch had leaned repeatedly on the one man who came closest to being a suspect and got nowhere . He was able to trace Marie Gesto from her apartment to the supermarket but no further . He had her car in the garage at the High Tower Apartments but he could n't get to the person who had parked it there . Bosch had plenty of unsolved cases in his history . You ca n't clear them all and any Homicide man would admit it . But the Gesto case was one that stuck with him . Each time he would work the case for a week or so , hit the wall and then return the file to Archives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the absolution only lasted a few months and then there he was at the counter filling out the file request form again . He would not give up . " Bosch , " one of the other detectives called out . " Miami on two . " Bosch had n't even heard the phone ring in the squad room . " I 'll take it , " Rider said . " Your head 's somewhere else . " She picked up the phone and once more Bosch opened the Gesto file . ( Continues ... )
