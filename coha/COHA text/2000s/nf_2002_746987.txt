Section : SEPTIC SYSTEMS <p> In 1997 , EPA and Congress officially recognized onsite wastewater treatment systems ( commonly referred to as septic systems ) as a viable , long-term solution for treating waste water . This was an important designation since nearly 40 percent of new homes in the United States use this type of system to treat household wastewater . <p> For more advanced wastewater management , there are dozens of pretreatment technologies to choose from that use the standard septic system as the core . The number of pretreatment installations is anticipated to grow over the next ten years due to environmental issues and new regulations , but it is predicted that the majority of systems installed in the future will still be the standard septic type . <p> Why ? The standard septic system provides effective treatment , requires minimal maintenance , offers longevity and is a good economical choice . This makes the standard septic system an effective solution for the majority of onsite wastewater applications in the future . History of the Standard System <p> Septic systems play a vital role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal of the septic system was once thought to be a temporary one : provide a solution for wastewater disposal in rural/suburban areas until sewer piping could be extended to those areas . A significant shift away from this mindset occurred in 1997 when Congress recognized the vitality and effectiveness of the tried and tree standard septic system , particularly for small communities . In its " Response to Congress on the Use of Decentralized Wastewater Treatment Systems , " the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) stated that onsite systems can and should be considered as long-term solutions . For the professionals ( contractors , regulators , soil scientists , engineers and research professors ) working with onsite systems , this was not ground breaking information . However , obtaining political acceptance from the EPA and Congress had been a long battle and therefore made this conclusion a milestone . <p> Not all wastewater professionals agree on what specific components make up the standard , every-day septic system . Scott Wallace , P.E. , vice president of North American Wetland Engineering said , " For me , a standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment and disposal . What makes up a good standard system is combining the correct application of soils evaluation , loading factors , topography and hydraulics to develop a system layout that achieves high levels of treatment in a simple , cost-effective package . " <p> Bob Long , Chief of Special Programs for the Oakland ( Mich . ) County Health Department said that to him , a standard system is one that meets his local sanitary code related to the amount of trench per bedroom in optimum or acceptable soil conditions . <p> " This can be a combination of conventional septic tank , tile field , tile bed or drywell , however the system can not be oversized from what is prescribed in the sanitary code , " Long said . <p> Although the characteristics of a standard system may vary depending on to whom you speak , what people do agree on is that this method , elegant in its simple utilization of a tank and a leachfield , does more than meet the goal of disposal . In fact , the system far exceeds the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratory research data available today draws the same conclusion . Defining a Standard System <p> What defines a standard onsite system depends on the timeframe being considered . At one time , cesspools were standard systems . Then came septic tanks with either seepage , pits or seepage beds . Now the septic tank and leachfield combination is generally considered the standard or standard system . Today , more than 25 percent of homes and nearly 40 percent of new development in the United States are served by onsite septic systems . Of this number , approximately 70 percent are a combination of a septic tank and leachfield . Of the remaining 30 percent , 25 percent incorporate pretreatment systems . <p> The perspective on what specific combination of tank and leachfield makes up a standard system varies by region of the country . The tank can have one or two compartments and it can be manufactured from a variety of materials including concrete , plastic or fiberglass . Leachfields can be constructed with plastic or concrete chambers , stone and pipe , or they can be gravelless . Installation can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or parallel distribution . The large majority of systems function by gravity , but some may require pumping for mound applications or to overcome elevation differences . In many areas with slowly permeable soils or seasonally saturated soil conditions , mounds are the only soil treatment units that will function to treat sewage . Therefore , mounds have today become standard in those areas such as Wisconsin and Minnesota . <p> " I consider a standard system to have a septic tank or tanks in a relatively shallow installation to allow access for cleaning and service . My definition of a traditional system also includes a series of drainfield trenches using drop boxes to provide sequential distribution , " said Roger E. Machmeier , Ph.D. , P.E . <p> How is this different than an advanced or pretreatment system ? <p> Pretreatment systems were developed to handle wastewater in extremely sensitive areas or to accommodate unusual applications such as insufficient soil depth or difficult soil types . In some areas of the country , regulation has begun to specify pretreatment as a safeguard for onsite system performance whether it is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment that is borne by homeowners and developers . While these more complex systems are of tremendous value when enhanced treatment is required to protect public health or the environment , they should not be specified due to a lack of knowledge about the performance of standard systems . <p> Pretreatment systems come in a variety of shapes and sizes . The majority fall under the heading of Advanced Treatment Units ( ATUs ) or packed bed filters . A sand filter is a type of packed bed filter that has been around for more than a century . Newer packed bed technologies consist of peat , textile or foam media . The packed bed filters generally are very reliable and provide good treatment . <p> ATUs can be further broken down into two groups : suspended growth and attached growth . Suspended growth systems provide an environment for organisms to thrive within the liquid . Attached growth systems rely on a media as a surface for organisms to attach . Extended aeration is an example of a suspended growth system , while a trickling filter is an example of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretreatment system and a standard system is not necessarily in treatment levels . It is in the increase in cost and maintenance requirements of the pretreatment system . If a pretreatment device is compared only to the septic tank in a standard system , then yes , it provides an improvement in terms of treatment . When the treatment provided by the soil is included in the equation , the difference is not so apparent . <p> Table 1 illustrates results from a study performed by the Massachusetts Septic System Test Center . The highly controlled test compares new technologies to the standard septic system . Each system receives the same wastewater flow and each is designed for a three-bedroom home . They also each receive the same wastewater strength , the sanitary sewer line is tapped , and supplies flow to the test center . Each technology discharges to a soil absorption system , and each has the same soil type and depth from which effluent samples are taken . <p> As shown by the results , the standard system performs similarly to the newer technologies in terms of treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Advanced Treatment Units ( ATUs ) may be misleading . They may be advanced as compared to a septic tank alone , but not as compared to the system of the tank and soil together . The noted exceptions are nitrogen treatment , installation cost and O &M; costs . The case where proper treatment by standard onsite septic systems can be a potential concern is in nutrient sensitive areas , waterfront areas or tight lots where the accumulation of the nutrients is a concern . Why Does It Work ? Function and Maintenance <p> At the National Onsite Wastewater Recycling Association ( NOWRA ) 2000 Conference , E. Jerry Tyler presented a paper entitled , " What happened to the passive onsite wastewater system ? " At the presentation he explained that the standard system uses the soil and the processes of nature to treat wastewater . It is simple in design but effective , making it cost efficient as well as environmentally responsible . It also is a passive system , requiring no outside energy to operate . It is truly a wonder of nature . In our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently without constant attention is hard to accept . <p> Because of its simplicity , the standard system requires only minimal maintenance . Tank pumping and overall inspection every three to five years is typically required to ensure proper system function . Although improved maintenance programs are needed and are on the horizon , this is mainly an effort to ensure that the operator ( homeowner ) is actually contracting for the basic maintenance required . Longevity <p> The standard septic system has an excellent track record despite the bashing it often gets from advocates of sewering or more stringent regulation . The low failure rates are the result of improved site evaluation and installation by knowledgeable contractors . These contractors tailor the installation and specific combination of products used to the available site and usage information . <p> In Oregon , a recent study evaluating more than 400 systems put the failure rate below two percent . The low failure rate was attributed to a strong wastewater program operated by the Oregon Health Department . It also was a result of modern site and soils evaluations , educated , trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Massachusetts Septic System Test Center touches on system longevity in its " Explanation of Facts " sheets . It states " A conventional soil absorption system is expected to last a minimum of 30 years if properly designed . " I would only add " ... and maintained , " and I think most experts would agree . Raising the Bar <p> It often has been said that in order for onsite septic systems to play a major role in the future of wastewater treatment , the level of standards and professionalism throughout the onsite wastewater industry must be raised . While it may not be apparent to most users , the education , technology and regulation related to onsite wastewater treatment has been the focus of much attention for the last several years . <p> Contractors have an increased understanding of how systems function due to the establishment of training centers and manufacturer education initiatives . There are presently thirty onsite wastewater training centers in the United States and Canada , and several states and provinces require that installing contractors be licensed or certified . <p> The EPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest university research . State regulatory departments also have increased their level of knowledge and professionalism . Many updated codes require the site evaluation and/or the design of the system to be conducted by professionals such as soil scientists or engineers . <p> Post-installation system management is being reviewed as a key area needing further attention and regulation beyond the individual system operator ( the homeowner ) . The onsite industry is having growing pains regarding system management , and many new management strategies currently are being tested and discussed . These include fee-based utility oversight of individual systems and mandatory pumping schedules with record keeping by the regulatory department . Conclusion <p> Standard onsite wastewater treatment utilizing a septic tank and a leachfield has accomplished the goals set out by EPA . The bad reputation they sometimes receive due to poorly designed , installed or failing systems is not generally deserved . They have been and will continue to be the workhorses of the wastewater treatment industry ; , available to the public in areas where there are no options and at a cost that no competitive technology can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last century Due to substantial improvements in the onsite wastewater industry from increased science and understanding , higher standards for installers , updated codes , more thorough site evaluations and inclusion of designers , there is no reason to believe that the next century should be any different . <p> After reviewing the benefits and advantages of the standard system as compared to new treatment technologies , ATUs or pretreatment systems , it is clear that the standard septic system will remain the system of choice for the majority of installations in the future . <p> For more information on this subject , circle 869 on the reader service card .
