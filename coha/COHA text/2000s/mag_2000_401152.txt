Section : FITNESS What are the most effective ways to add muscle and burn fat ? The experts have spoken : These moves beat the rest <p> EXERCISE TRENDS ARE called trends for a reason . They last about as long as a head of lettuce and offer about as much benefit as , well , a head of lettuce . But there are some exercises that have been around since the birth of Larry King . And that 's because they work . But which are the best of the best ? <p> We polled the people whose opinions matter  --  exercise researchers , strength coaches , physical therapists , top trainers , an entire C.S.C.S. convention , and a few thick-necked guys who watch the door at our favorite bar  --  and made them vote on the most effective exercises you can do in a dozen different categories , plus the single best one of all time . <p> We did n't bother coming up with a catchy name for these awards . As long as you add them to your workouts , we 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you . BEST NO-WEIGHT EXERCISE The PUSHUP <p> What 's great about pushups is that you can do them even though you may be weaker than the Russian ruble . You can start with a few , and over time increase repetitions at a good , even pace that builds muscle in the places that count ( chest , shoulders , triceps ) . Different variations of the exercise can work the abdominals as well , says Eric Ludlow , C.S.C.S. , senior trainer at World Gym in New York City . <p> The pushup that impresses : Only the strongest and bravest should attempt a one-arm pushup . Yes , we 're talking about you . <p> To do a one-arm pushup with your right arm , widen your feet and place your right hand on the floor beneath the middle of your chest . Tuck your left arm behind your back . As you lower yourself , you 'll realize that this is n't a straight-up-and-down movement like a regular pushup . You 'll twist on the ball of your left foot and untwist as you push yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel muscles working all up and down the right side of your body . <p> Do an equal number with each arm , and do n't even try one-arm pushups unless you can bench-press your own body weight eight to 10 times . BEST EXERCISE NO ONE DOES ANYMORE The Clean and Jerk <p> The clean and jerk used to be a staple move in hard-core gyms where guys named Tiny threw around weights the size of Toyotas . <p> " But it 's making a big comeback in collegiate training rooms , " says Dave Pearson , Ph.D. , an exercise physiologist at Ball State University . " It requires a combination of speed , strength , skill , and balance that few exercises can match , " raves Thomas Incledon , C.S.C.S. , a nutritionist and kinesiology instructor at Nova Southeastern University in Davie , Florida . <p> Go ahead and jerk : Juan Carlos Santana , C.S.C.S. , recommends the version below , using dumbbells instead of a barbell . <p> Start with light weights , and focus on building speed more than building strength . Add weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural . BEST EXERCISE FOR THE BEACH The Arm-Blaster Curl <p> The arm blaster  --  a thin strip of metal that hangs from your shoulders and prevents your elbows from moving forward and back during a curl  --  forces your biceps to work much harder than they would if allowed to swing a little . Consequently , this curl is the best single exercise for working all parts of the biceps with maximum intensity , according to an MRI analysis conducted by Per Tesch , Ph.D. , author of Target Bodybuilding . <p> And the biceps are the best muscles to display on the beach , according to our experts , especially if a rumble breaks out over blanket space . " The stronger your biceps , the faster you can punch , " says Tom Seabourne , Ph.D. , a sports psychologist , martial artist , and author of Complete Cardiokickboxing . <p> Build a beach body : Check out our workout poster following page 60 . Included is the arm-blaster curl , as well as other quick muscle-builders that made our short list . BEST STRENGTH EXERCISE The SQUAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then you do n't have a workout . Squats shape the body and develop performance power , asserts Don Chu , Ph.D. , director of the physical-therapy program at Ohlone College in Newark , California . <p> " It 's the easiest power move to learn , and you 'll see the fastest results " in both strength and muscle size , adds Jason Pulido , personal training manager at the Crunch gym in lower Manhattan . <p> To get more out of the squat : Focus on squatting deeper , rather than heavier . The key is to descend until your thighs are parallel to the floor , while still keeping your heels on the floor and maintaining the natural arch in your lower back . ( Use a light weight until you develop the correct form . ) This deeper squat builds muscle faster and is safer for your knees than a squat in which you stop before your thighs are parallel to the floor . When you cut a squat short like that , you turn your knees into brakes . And you know what happens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N'T WANT YOUR COWORKERS TO KNOW YOU DO Pilates <p> At least it 's not Suzanne Somers 's Buttmaster . But what the hell is Pilates ? It 's a form of exercise designed by the dancer Joseph Pilares back in the 1920s . ( You remember him , right ? ) The idea is to make the body more stable and injury-resistant by strengthening muscles when they 're in fully lengthened positions , since those tend to be the points at which injuries occur in athletes . <p> Pilates in private : People who try Pilates rave about improvements in their waistlines . Zayna Gold , who teaches special guy-friendly Pilates classes at the Boston Body health club , recommends the rolldown ( see bottom left ) : Sit on the floor , legs stretched in front of you . Hold on to your legs wherever you can ( ankles is ideal , behind the knees more realistic ) A. Inhale deeply , pull your belly in as far as you can , and roll back , vertebra by vertebra , as you exhale B , C , and D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Circuit Weight Training <p> The beauty of circuit weight training  --  moving from one exercise to the next with little rest in between  --  is that you can modify it to achieve lots of different goals . Going faster and using lighter weights can improve heart health and muscle endurance , while doing a slower circuit with heavier weights can build strength and muscle size and speed up metabolism . Research has shown that for men recuperating from heart surgery , circuit training is the safest and most effective exercise to nurse them back to health . <p> You can turn any workout you do into a circuit . It 's simple : Do all your exercises one after the other , with 15- to 30-second rests in between . Repeat the circuit three times . The beach-muscle workout on our pullout poster doubles as a good circuit routine . BEST EXERCISE CLASS FOR MEN Boot Camp <p> If you 're going to train men to kill , you 're not going to teach them Tae-Bo . " Boot camp develops willpower and determination , which can really help a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength coach who works with Olympic and professional athletes , and author of Get Buffed . <p> Turn your living room into a boot camp : Along with all the usual military-style exercises you can think of  --  pushups , situps , imperialistic marching songs  --  Patrick Avon , creator of the Sergeant 's Fitness Program , recommends you try these " arm haulers " : Lie on your stomach , cross your feet , lift your legs , and stick your arms straight out to the sides . Now move your arms up and down 100 times with your thumbs up A and 100 times with your thumbs down B. Do n't let your hands touch the floor . You 'll work your shoulders , rotator cuffs , and middle-back muscles . If you can keep your feet off the floor , you 'll also work your lower back , gluteals , and hamstrings . BEST SPORT FOR EXERCISE Basketball <p> Basketball players are in great shape because they never stop moving . " Basketball allows you to run , sprint , jump , slide , stop , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kreis , strength coach at the University of Colorado . Another benefit : Basketball requires both " power and power endurance  --  the ability to repeatedly jump up and down for rebounds and putbacks , " adds Michael Mejia , C.S.C.S. , a trainer in New York City . <p> Power up your rebounding : The rebound does n't always go to the player who can jump the highest  --  it 's the man who can keep jumping the same height three or four times in a row . Try these rim jumps : Stand beneath a basket , leap up , and slap both hands on the backboard , if you can . If not , just grab some net . ( If you ca n't do that ... well , we hear racquetball is fun . ) Land , then immediately hop back up . Keep going for 30 seconds . Rest 3 to 5 minutes , then repeat . Do a total of two to four sets , and do these only two times a week . BEST EXERCISE THAT 'S ALSO FUN Mountain Biking <p> Mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes a ton of balls , and you are n't even aware of what it 's doing for your body . A 180-pound guy mountain-biking for an hour burns almost 700 calories . <p> Bring the mountain to you : Mountain biking has a fitness payoff even when you have no mountain handy . Hit the flat road . Riding a mountain bike takes about a third more effort than riding a road bike , largely because of the increased rolling resistance from the fatter tires and the increased weight of the bike . So if your time is limited and you have a choice of bikes , it 's always better to choose the mountain bike , even if you 'll be riding it on the road . Riding 12 miles on fat tires is the equivalent of doing 15 on the skinny rubber . BEST EXERCISE THAT PRODUCES A USEFUL END PRODUCT Chopping Wood <p> " Chopping wood is the only real-life exercise that we try to replicate in the gym , " says Alwyn Cosgrove , C.S.C.S. , a trainer in North Hills , California . And Avon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood chopping  --  up to 23 per minute for a 180-pound man going all-out . Plus , he adds , " chicks dig a man with a flannel shirt and an ax . " <p> Chop off your love handles : The problem with chopping wood is that you need wood , an ax , and a yard . But you can easily mimic the motion in the gym with these " woodcutters " ( shown above ) . The payoff is a rippling waist and a more powerful home-run swing in the company softball game . BEST EXERCISE OF ALL TIME A tie : Running , Squat <p> Our esteemed group chose running because you can do it anywhere , and it does n't cost anything except what you pay for shoes . It also helps the heart while burning away flab . Our experts suggest you get out and walk , jog , or run three to five times a week . Or , better yet , do some of all three . <p> The squat , as we said before , builds the muscles of your lower body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast . So if you want a body that wo n't blow away in a gentle summer breeze , run to the weight room , settle under that bar , and do your squats . Three sets of 10 , twice a week , is good for starters . Then mix it up . Use heavy weights and low repetitions for a few weeks to build strength . Use lighter weights and higher repetitions after that to build muscle endurance . And never forget : The man who squats has carte blanche to bellow and grunt . You 'll be as strong as a caveman , with the freedom to sound like one , too . BEST AEROBIC EXERCISE RUNNING <p> It 's the most basic exercise you can do , but it 's also the most intense , says Santana . Become good at it , and you 'll be the only person smiling through the oil crisis . <p> To be a better runner : Focus on improving the speed of your strides rather than their length , says Tom Miller , Ph.D. , a biomechanics specialist in Salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body  --  rather than out in front of it  --  and you should push off the toes of your rear leg for propulsion . Another key is to keep your forearms high throughout the run . You should be able to brush your nipples with your thumbs .
