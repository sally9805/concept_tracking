Sexual intercourse began/In nineteen sixty-three , " Philip Larkin , the good , glum British poet famously , ironically wrote . You might argue with his date  --  in movies the sexual revolution came a little later  --  but not with his basic insight . Since then , though , under the camera 's avid scrutiny , onscreen sex has become an activity restricted to movie stars who are young and buff , with the older folks left pretty much standing in the corner , all buttoned up . <P> Now , though , a few new movies have boldly decided to go into essentially unmapped box-office territory and show some of our old movie pals nakedly enjoying elder sex . The theory is swell , even inviting to those of us not yet confined to our chimney corners . But alas , the films in question are smirky and joyless . <P> Take writer-director Nancy Meyers ' Something 's Got ta Give , in which Jack Nicholson plays Harry , an aging playboy who happens to catch a glimpse of his young girlfriend 's mom ( Diane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overachieving and all , she has become something of a prune , sexually speaking . But he has his charms , and one rainy day she succumbs to them . Nothing wrong with that . Their sex scene , despite what Meyers reports as a certain understandable shyness by her players , is agreeably managed . What 's less agreeable is this movie 's smugness . It 's so pleased to bravely show old folks having fun that it forgets to be genuinely comic , romantic or sexy . <P> You might say the same about Calendar Girls , which more or less truly tells the story of some middle-aged Yorkshire ladies who posed discreetly nude  --  flowerpots and craft projects cover the Xrated areas  --  to sell calendars for charity . They 're believably edgy about stripping  --  maybe the camera wo n't see all , but what about that cameraman ? And the likes of Helen Mirren and Julie Walters are good-looking good sports about all this . But the movie is not so much about getting naked as getting ( briefly ) famous . Easily predicted life lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> On a certain level this is O.K. Given good lighting and quick cuts , the performers look just fine . But lack of clothes does not necessarily lead to greater truthfulness . Indeed , it can be argued that the tender , fully clothed encounter between Ben Kingsley and Iranian actress Shohreh Aghdashloo in House of Sand and Fog tells us something profound about their relationship . The same way with the ( also clothed ) bathtub embrace between Albert Finney and Jessica Lange in Big Fish . On the other hand , the buck-naked romping of William H. Macy and Maria Bello in The Cooler is just as informative . Their bodies may be imperfect , but their pleasure is infectious . <P> That 's the thing about nudity on the screen . It does n't make any difference if what 's displayed is trim and taut or creased and worn . It 's not what we see but what we hope to feel that justifies the exposure . No matter how old the actors ( or the audience ) , that 's the best reason for going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , for dropping your own duds.  --  By Richard Schickel
