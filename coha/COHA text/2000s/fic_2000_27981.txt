" Pompey will be mightily pissed , " said Davus . " Son-in-law , you have a penchant for stating the obvious . " I sighed and knelt and steeled myself to take a closerlook . The lifeless body lay face-down in the middle of mygarden directly before the bronze statue of Minerva , like aprostrate worshiper at the goddess 's feet . Davus turned in a circle , shielding his eyes from themorning sunlight and peering warily at the four corners ofthe peristyle roof surrounding us . " What I ca n't see is howthe assassin got in and out without any of us in the househearing . " He wrinkled his brow , which made him look likea perplexed and much overgrown boy . Built like a Greekstatue , and just as thick ; that was Bethesda 's joke . My wifehad not taken kindly to the notion of our only daughtermarrying a slave , especially a slave who had been brashenough , or stupid enough , to get her pregnant . But ifDavus had a penchant for the obvious , Diana had a penchantfor Davus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful son , whom I could hear even nowscreaming at his mother and grandmother to be let out intothe garden , crying as only a two-year-old can . But Auluscould not be let out to play on this bright , mild Januariusafternoon , for there was a corpse in the garden . And not just any corpse . The dead man was NumeriusPompeius , who was somehow related to Pompeyone ofthe Great One 's cousins , though a couple of generationsyounger . He had arrived at my house , alone , half an hourearlier . Now he lay dead at my feet . " I can'tunderstand it . " Davus scratched his head . " Before I let him in the door , I took a good look up anddown the street , like I always do . I did n't notice anybodyfollowing him . " When Davus had been a slave , he hadbeen a bodyguardan obvious choice , given his hulkingphysique . He had been trained not just to fight but to keepa lookout for danger . Now as a freedman and my son-in-law , Davus was the physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was his job to greet visitors atthe door . Now that a murder had occurred within thehouse , practically under his nose , he took it as a personalfailure . In the face of my silence , Davus seemed determined to interrogate himself . He paced back and forth , using his fingers to tick off each question . " Why did I let him in ? Well , because he announced himself as Numerius Pompeius , Kinsman of the Great One.And he came alonenot even a bodyguard to worryaboutso I did n't see any need to make him wait outside.I let him into the foyer . Did I ask if he had any weapons ? It 's against the law to carry weapons inside the city walls , of course , but nobody pays attention to that these days , soyes , I did ask , and he did n't make any fuss at all and handedover his dagger right away . Did I search him for moreweapons , as you 've told me to do , even with citizens ? Yes , I did , and he did n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment ? No , I did not . I stayed with him therein the foyer , sent little Mopsus to tell you there was a visitor , then waited until you sent back word that you 'd seehim . I escorted him through the house , back here to thegarden . Diana and Aulus were out here with you , playing inthe sunny spot at Minerva 's feet ... right where Numeriusis lying now ... but you sent them inside . Did I stay withyou ? No , because you sent me inside , too . But I knew better ! I should have stayed . " " Numerius said he had a message for my ears alone , " Isaid . " If a man ca n't safely have a private talk in his ownhome ... " I looked about the garden , at the carefullypruned shrubbery and the brightly colored columns thatlined the surrounding walkway . I gazed up at the bronzestatue of Minerva ; after all these years , the face that peereddown from her great war helmet remained inscrutable tome . The garden was at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I was not safe here , then Iwas safe nowhere . " Do n't chastise yourself , Davus . You did your job . " " But I should never have left you unguarded , evenfor " " Have we reached a point where a common citizenneeds to mimic Pompey or Caesar , and have a bodyguardstanding over him every moment of every hour , evenwhen he 's wiping his ass ? " Davus frowned , I knew what he was thinkingthat itwas unlike me to talk so crudely , that I must be badly shakenand trying not to show it , that his father-in-law was gettingtoo old to deal with ugly shocks like a corpse in thegarden before the midday meal . He stared up at the rooftopagain . " But Numerius was n't the danger , was he ? It was whoeverfollowed him here . The killer must be half lizard , toscurry up and down the walls without making a sound ! Did you hear nothing , father-in-law ? " " I told you , Numerius and I talked for a while , then I lefthim for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that 's only a few feet away . Still , I suppose the statueof Minerva might have blocked the view . And yourhearing " " My ears are as sharp as those of any man of sixty-one ! " Davus nodded respectfully . " However it happened , it'sa good thing you were n't out here when the assassin came , or else ... " " Or else I might have been strangled , too ? " I touchedmy fingers to the rope that still circled Numerius 's neck , cutting into the livid flesh . He had been killed with a simplegarrote , a short loop of rope attached to each end of ashort , stout twisting stick . Davus knelt beside me . " The killer must have come upbehind him , dropped the garrote over his head , then usedthe stick to twist it tighter and tighter around his throat . Agruesome way to die . " I turned away , feeling queasy . " But a quiet way , " Davus went on . " Numerius couldn'teven cry out ! Maybe he managed a gurgle or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air cut off , the only way to make asound would be to bang against something . See there , father-in-law , how Numerius gouged his heels into thegravel ? But that would n't make much noise . If only hecould have banged a fist against the bronze Minerva ... but both hands are clutched to his throat . That 's a man'sinstinct , to try to tear the rope from his neck . I wonder ... " Davus peered up at the roof again . " The killer need n't havebeen a big fellow . It does n't take a great deal of strength togarrote a man , even a big man , so long as you take himunaware . " I nodded . " Pompey will have to be told . I suppose . Imust do it myselfmake the trip outside the city walls toPompey 's villa , wait for an interview , give him the badnews , then let him deal with the matter as he chooses.Here , help me roll the body face-up . " From inside the house , I heard my little grandsonshouting again to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bethesda and Diana peered out anxiously , Itwas something of a miracle that they had so far obeyedme and stayed out of the garden . Bethesda started tospeak , but I held up my hand and shook my head . I wasrather surprised when she nodded and withdrew , takingDiana with her . I forced myself to look at Numerius 's strangled face . Itwas a sight to give anyone nightmares . He had been young , in his twenties , probably a bit olderthan Davus . His broad , blandly handsome features werenow discolored and distorted and almost unrecognizablein a rictus of agony . I swallowed hard . As I used two fingersto shut his lids , I saw my reflection in the black poolof his staring eyes . No wonder my wife and daughter hadobeyed me without question . The look on my face wasalarming even to me . I stood , my knees crackling like the gravel beneath myfeet . Davus sprang up beside me , as supple as a cat despitehis size . " Pompey will be mightily pissed , " I said gravely . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Davus . But bad news keeps , as the poetsays . The day is young , and I see no need to rush acrossRome to bring Pompey the news . What do you say we havea closer look , and see what Numerius may be carrying ? " " But I told you , I searched him when I took his dagger.There was only a small moneybag around his waist , with aclip for his scabbard . Nothing else . " " I would n't be sure of that . Help me take off his clothes.Be careful ; we shall have to put everything back exactly asit was , before Pompey 's men come to claim the body . Beneath his well-cut woolen tunic , Numerius wore alinen loincloth . It was wet with urine , but he had notsoiled himself . He wore no jewelry except for his citizen'sring . I took off the ring and examined it ; it appeared to besolid iron , with no secret compartments or hidden devices.There were only a few coins inside his moneybag ; consideringthe chaotic state of the city , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrymore . I turned the bag inside out . There were no secretpockets . " Perhaps you 're right , Davus , Perhaps he was carryingnothing of interest , after all . Unless ... Take off his shoes , would you ? My back aches from bending over . " The uppers were made of finely tanned black leatherstamped with an intricate design of interconnected triangles , closed and fastened by thongs that wound around theankle and calf . The soles were quite thick , made of severallayers of hardened leather attached to the uppers by hobnails.There was nothing inside them , They were warmand carried the scent of Numerius 's feet ; handling themwas more intimate than handling his clothing or even hisring . I was about to hand them back to Davus when Inoticed an irregularity in the layered sole , at the heel . Thesame irregularity appeared at the same spot in both shoes.There were two breaks in the middle layer of the sole , about a thumb 's length apart . Near one of the breaks was asmall hole . " Do you have the dagger you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . Ah , I see ! But if youmean to cut into his shoes , I can fetch a better knife fromthe kitchen . " " No , let me see Numerius 's dagger . " Davus reached inside his tunic . I handed him the shoesand he handed me the dagger in its sheath . I nodded . " What do you notice about this sheath , Davus ? " He frowned , suspecting a test of some sort . " It 's madeof leather . " " Yes , but what sort of leather ? " " Black . " He saw that I was unimpressed and tried again . " It 's decorated . " " How ? " " It 's stampedand the same pattern is carved on thewooden hilt of the dagger . " " Yes , a pattern of interlocking triangles . " Davus peered at the shoes in his hands . " The same patternas on his shoes ! " " Exactly . Meaning ? " Davus was stumped . " Meaning , " I said , " that whatever shop made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rather unusual , don'tyou think , that the same shop should produce such dissimilargoods ? " Davus nodded , pretending to follow my thoughts . " Soareyou going to pull out the dagger and cut open theshoes , or not ? " " No , Davus , I am going to unlock the shoes . " I left theblade in its sheath and studied the hilt , which was carvedfrom the hard black wood of the Syrian terebinth , attached to the metal by bosses of ivory . The triangle design ingeniouslyconcealed the hidden compartment in the hilt , butit slid open easily once I found the right place to presswith my thumb . Inside the compartment was a tiny key , hardly more than a sliver of bronze with a little hook nearone end . " Son-in-law , hold up the shoes with the heels facingme . " I started with the shoe on my left . The irregularity inthe heel , the two breaks I had noticed in the center layer ofleather , proved to be a narrow door , with a hinge at oneside and a keyhole at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole . After a bit of fiddling , the door gave a littlesnap and sprang open . " Extraordinary ! " I whispered . " What workmanship ! Sodelicateyet sturdy enough to be trod on . " I took the shoefrom Davus , held it under the sunlight and peered downinto the narrow chamber . I saw nothing . I turned the shoeover and knocked it against my palm . Nothing came out . " Empty ! " I said . " We could still cut into it , " said Davus helpfully . I gave him a withering look . " Son-in-law , did I not saythat we must put back all of Numerius 's things exactly asthey were , so that Pompey 's men will see no signs of ourtampering when they come to fetch him ? " Davus nodded . " That includes his shoes ! Now hand me the other one . " I inserted the key and fiddled until the lock sprang open . There was something inside . I withdrew what appeared to be several pieces of thin parchment.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
