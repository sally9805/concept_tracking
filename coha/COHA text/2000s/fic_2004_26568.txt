Phantom Stallion #10 : Red Feather Filly Chapter One Overhead , two wild geese split off from a ragged vee of birds winging south . As their flock flew on , the pair turned back , swooping low enough that Samantha Forster heard the silken rush of feathers and saw the glitter of dark eyes studying her . A dome of blue sky arched over River Bend Ranch . Underfoot , a few shoots of grass ventured through dirt dark from melting snow . There was a moment of silence from the squadron of construction workers hammering as fast as they could to rebuild the barn while the sunny weather lasted . With permission from Dad , they 'd arrived just as the sun was rising . Since six A.M. , this was the first time they 'd quit pounding . In the quiet , Sam could hear the La Charla River dashing under the bridge , gurgling over rocks frosted with morning ice . Northern Nevada was still making up its mind about springtime , but Sam knew it had arrived . " Samantha , did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear he knew she had n't . " Sorry , what ? " Sam felt as if she 'd come plummeting back down to earth . Dad and Brynna sat on their horses , ready to ride out . For a minute , she 'd forgotten all about them . " Honey , " Dad said , " that 's just what I 'm talking about . " What was just what he 'd been talking about ? Sam tried not to look guilty . She stared up past Strawberry 's roan legs , past Dad 's faded jeans , and met his eyes . " You 've got permission to walk the buckskin and to ride Ace . That 's it . Do n't take it into your head to give Popcorn a try . " " I was n't  --  " Dad held out a hand to keep her from interrupting and Sam wondered how he 'd turned into a mind reader . She 'd heard Brynna , her new stepmother , talking about getting a rider up on Popcorn pretty soon . Sam wanted to be the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it to anyone . " I 've seen you eyeing him , Sam . You 're not up to it yet . " Dad 's words stung , even though she knew it was true . " I want to be sure you 're clear about this before I go . You 're forbidden to mount him unless someone is watching over you . Spring fever can be a dangerous thing . " " I get it , " Sam said . For a second , Dad looked like he might mention her tone . Again . But Brynna spoke up . " She understands , Wyatt , " Brynna said . " Okay , " Dad said . He relaxed in the saddle and Strawberry 's ears pricked forward , sensing they were about to go . " We 're gon na check out the graze in the spring pasture and decide when to move the cattle . We 'll probably be a couple hours . " He and Brynna rode out at a trot . Within seconds , their laughter flowed back to Sam . They probably were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt . You 're not up to it yet . She 'd only been back on the ranch for about nine months . And she had taken her share of spills . But why did Dad have to rub it in ? She 'd find a way to show him she was n't the worst rider in northern Nevada . But how ? The sudden thunder of nearby hooves made Sam turn back toward the ten-acre pasture . Nike , red mane streaming as he paced along the fence , had spotted the halter in her hand . He stopped and tossed his head , attracting the attention of other horses . Tank , the big bald-faced bay , joined Nike . Soon Amigo and Buff jostled each other in excitement . Behind her , Ace and Sweetheart created a commotion inside the round pen . The high-sided corral had been their home since an earthquake destroyed the old portion of the barn and their attached corrals . The horses had adapted to the pen , but they missed the open view they 'd had of the ranch . Now they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two horses had snorted a greeting when Sam had passed by on her way to the damaged tack room to get Dark Sunshine 's halter . They 'd been patient when she 'd walked by without stopping for them . But now that it looked like she might be leaving with another horse , they neighed in protest . " It 's okay , boy , " she called to Ace , letting him know he was n't forgotten . The long minutes Ace had been trapped in the fallen barn had reminded Sam how much she loved her little bay mustang . " Jen will be here soon and then I 'll get you out of there . " In the bad weather , most ranch work had been done from a pickup truck instead of on horseback . These were working horses and their vacation had left them full of energy . In the pasture , Buff lifted his furry brown body into a half rear . The others shifted to give him space , but their ears remained pricked forward and their eyes watched Sam . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a halter , " Sam told Blaze . The Border collie pranced beside her , tail waving , mouth open , as he escorted her to the pasture . Popcorn finished rolling in the mud , heaved himself to his feet , and shook . His white coat was wet and smeared with brown . He 'd noticed he was missing something and trotted to join the others by the fence . Only one horse hung back . Dark Sunshine ignored the saddle horses ' excitement and stared toward the Calico Mountains . She turned one ear to catch Sam 's boot steps , but her head stayed high , her attention focused . " The only horse on the place who is n't fascinated , " Sam told Blaze , " is the one I need to catch . " Blaze panted sympathetically . " Get back , " Sam ordered the other horses , but they did n't . She jiggled the latch on the gate , then waved her hand .                  @ @ @
