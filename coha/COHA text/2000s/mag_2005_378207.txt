About an hour before the first pitch on a breezy Southern California evening , Arturo ( Arte ) Moreno , billionaire owner of the Major League Baseball team now known as the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim , walks the concourse of Angels Stadium , picking up cigarette butts and greeting fans . In January Moreno upset many Orange County supporters of the former Anaheim Angels by tacking Los Angeles onto the team name , relegating Anaheim , a city of 343,000 , 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles , to a mere appendage . He also granted the Angels the dubious distinction of being the only major pro-sports franchise identified by two cities . Yet tonight awestruck fans greet him like a savior . A man in a WE ARE NOT LA Angels T shirt praises him . " It means so much to have a Mexican-American owner , " a Hispanic fan tells Moreno , the first Latino team owner in major U.S. sports . " As long as we win , " says another , " I do n't care if you call them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like pregame shouting matches ( imagine Bronx fans smiling at George Steinbrenner if he tinkered with the hallowed Yankee name ) . Or maybe the Angels faithful know that despite the garbled name , with Moreno they still have it good . In building Outdoor Systems , a small outfit based in Phoenix , Ariz. , into the country 's largest billboard-advertising company , which Infinity ( now part of Viacom ) swallowed for $8.3 billion in 1999 , Moreno , 58 , has been guided by a basic mantra : " When you take a risk , you 're either thinking you 're real smart or you 're real dumb . " Moreno is feeling pretty bright right now as he moves to expand the Angels brand throughout the 16.7 million-strong Los Angeles metropolitan area  --  and beyond  --  by phasing out a small-market moniker . " If you 're going to niche market , " says Moreno , " you 're going to get trapped . " <P> Moreno 's critics are scratching their heads . Why would an owner who last season generated so much good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and signing American League MVP Vladimir Guerrero provide fodder for late-night comedians ? ( Craig Ferguson joked of another name change : " The San Francisco Giants on Steroids " ) . More important , why would Moreno potentially alienate an affluent suburban fan base in Orange County ? Says Anaheim mayor Curt Pringle , a red T shirt that reads THE ANAHEIM ANGELS OF ANAHEIM hanging in his office : " We 're sad , and we 're very disappointed . " <P> The city is suing Moreno and the Angels for violating the spirit of a 1996 agreement with prior team owner Disney . The city conceded the bulk of revenue sharing with the Angels in exchange for the Anaheim label ( the team was called the California Angels from 1965 , the year before it moved from Los Angeles to Anaheim , through 1996 ) . " He 's stepping on the little guy , the taxpayer , " says Pringle , who claims that under the pre-1996 contract the city would have received $11.5 million more from the team last season . The Angels note that Anaheim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for November ; an injunction to revert to the former name until then has already been rejected ( and is under appeal ) . " The name change stinks , " says Nancy Chavez , 52 , a 15-year season ticketholder from Orange County who seriously considered dropping her ticket package this year . " We are not L.A. It 's a slap in the face . "
