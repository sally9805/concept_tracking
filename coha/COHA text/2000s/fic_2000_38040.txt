" When Charles Brockden Brown , the first professional American author , sent a copy of his Wieland to Thomas Jefferson in 1798 , he must , beneath his modest disclaimers , have had some sense of his and the President 's kinship as revolutionaries .... But if Jefferson ever found the time to read Brown 's novel , he left no record .... " <p> - Leslie Fiedler , Love and Death in the American Novel I SMILED broadly for the reporter 's tiny wireless webcam pasted like a bindi to her forehead . My last answer had been exceptionally well-phrased , and both of us knew my clever words would go down well with her literate online audience at the venerable Salon/Onion/Washington Post . Suddenly the Oval Office seemed a warm and cozy parlor , despite all its ostentatious trappings of mid-twenty-first-century status , from genetically modified Secret Service bodyguards to the laserline link to the Lunar Republic . <p> " So , " the young woman continued , " you ascribe the remarkable rise to power of your party mainly to the exhaustion of all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many scandals and unappealing candidates . ' The blindly unimaginative misleading the marginalized and blindsided ' I believe was your phrase of a moment ago . " <p> " Exactly so . Leaders without vision and visionaries without leaders . A regular mess-until we came along . But there was also the not insignificant matter of our enticingly revolutionary platform . " <p> The young woman grinned . " Ah , yes , that famous exhortation . ' Do n't leave the lying to the amateurs ? Elect the most qualified fictionalizers around ! " ' <p> " We adopted that policy from a best-selling book by one of our members who had actually dabbled in politics in the twentieth century . As one of his characters noted : ' They 'll vote for me because I 'm the best liar , because I do it honestly , with a certain finesse . They know that lies and truth are very close , and that something beautiful rests in between . " ' <p> " And this genius was - ? " <p> " Mark Helprin . " <p> The woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicating she was offering me a lewinsky . She was only using her wetware to establish a hyperlink to Helprin 's name . " So having adopted this revelation as your party 's platform , you effectively stepped into a vacuum and took control . " <p> I tempted my fingers together thoughtfully . " Not a vacuum , but a chaos . Try to recall the aftermath of the election of 2012 . I know you were probably only a child then , but surely some of the national confusion must have registered even on your generation . President Ventura rendered an ineffectual quadriplegic by a Head Drop during his Inaugural Smackdown . VicePresident Rodham holding off the New York State Attorney-General and his charges of Catskill realestate fraud with one hand , while with the other she tried to dismiss the paparazzi photos of her and Martha Stewart skinny-dipping together off Nantucket . And of course the complete collapse of that economic powerhouse **26;1954;TOOLONG under the triple assaults of plastic-eating bacteria , cheap qubit computers in a testtube and terrorist-unleashed coffeeplant-killer viruses . Why , it took Seattle a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once Speaker of the House Beatty ascended to the Presidency , the moral decline was complete . " <p> " But I still do n't see how all this allowed your untested party to sweep the 2016 elections . Coming from nowhere to capture the Presidency itself and a majority in both houses - it was just unprecedented ! " <p> " Agreed . But you have to remember that the voting public was truly desperate for uncompromised leaders . Everyone else had already had their chance at running the country , and blown it . Lawyers , businessmen , generals , entertainers , teachers , gangsters - the only organized and capable group that had n't had its shot at elective office yet was us . " <p> " The Science Fiction Writers of America . " <p> The majestic words resonated mellifluously in the Oval Office , and I paused to let them sink deeply into the unseen audience 's ears . " Yes , the SFWA . I 'm surprised you even recall the origin of the acronym . Nowadays , it 's such a well-known political trademark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original meaning , any more than folks once thought ' Grand Old Party ' when they heard GOP . But your derivation is accurate . The roots of our party lie in a writer 's union . " <p> " It must have been some union . " <p> " Indeed . By 2012 , practically every best-selling book and movie in the nation was science fiction or fantasy of some sort . Members of SFWA accounted for the direct production of approximately twentyfive percent of the GNP , and had almost single-handedly eliminated the trade deficit . If you added spinoffs and subsidies , our contribution approached thirty percent . Only the popstars and pornstars rivaled our dominance , and we had cleverly established close alliances with them . " <p> " With an eye toward future political maneuvers , perhaps ? " <p> I gave her the same smile that had once caused Oprah to label me the sweetest writer she had ever spotlighted . " It 's hard to say now what we had in mind - although we did devote a lot of our energies to internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to national power . We were n't always a major player , you realize . Once upon a time , we were an insignificant ninety-pound weakling of an organization . But the turning point came with two crucial decisions . The first was rather arcane : the decision to reinstate the Dramatic Nebula . I do n't expect you to comprehend all the minute historical details of this award , but basically that move tightened our ties to Hollywood , considerably broadening our membership , and hence our clout . " <p> " And what was the second decision ? " <p> " Making J. K. Rowling our permanent Wizard-in-Chief . " <p> The reporter reached religiously up to fondle the pendant of Saint Potter that hung from a chain around her neck , and whispered a short anti-Muggle mantra . " Of course . Immediately you would have enlisted half the nation in your camp , a whole generation . What a stroke of genius ! " <p> I modestly bowed my head . " Thank you . I was Membership Secretary at the time . " <p> " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . " <p> " Not completely . But we had no choice , due to the chaos I 've described . Hastily , we mounted candidates in as many national elections as we could . We could n't run Rowling for President , of course , as she was a foreigner , but she campaigned like a trouper for us . Still , no one was more surprised that we were swept into office by the landslide results you described earlier . " <p> " And it was smooth sailing from that point onward . " <p> " By no means . We 've always had internal dissension , even if we 've maintained a smooth facade for the good of the country . The tussles between the autocratic and libertarian elements of SFWA were rivaled only by those between the fantasy gals and the hard sf boys . If you 've ever wondered why we have both a Ministry of Surveillance and a Free Dope bureaucracy , now you know . " <p> " Ah , I see ! That also explains why the Mars Terraforming program has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No matter what changes superficially , compromise lies at the heart of politics . " <p> " Well , you ca n't fault success . The United States of America has never been stronger or more dominant . Our mode of government by writers has practically swamped the globe . I understand that even that last holdout , France , is finally turning over the reins to their Academy . " <p> " Yes , it looks rather as if the Utopia we long speculated about is finally here . But that reminds me of a pressing chore . I 'm afraid we 'll have to terminate our interview now . " <p> The reporter followed my lead and arose . " Time to negotiate a treaty or address the UN perhaps ? " <p> " Not at all . I 've got the last volume of a trilogy due this week , and my publisher has already told me he 's going to demand my advance back if I do n't deliver ! " <p>                @ @ @ @ @
