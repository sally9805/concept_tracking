President-elect Barack Obama turned to a leading authority on the Great Depression for his economic team Monday , tapping UC Berkeley economist Christina Romer to head his Council of Economic Advisers as part of his battle plan to address what he described as " an economic crisis of historic proportions . " <p> The Romer pick , along with Timothy Geithner , who was chosen as secretary of the Treasury , and Lawrence Summers , who will be the top White House economic adviser as head of the National Economic Council , speaks to the depth of Obama ' s worry about the danger zone the economy has entered . <p> Romer , 49 , also fits an emerging pattern of decidedly centrist economic appointments - despite promises of an enormous fiscal stimulus that could match October 's jaw-dropping $700 billion bank rescue - that has disappointed many liberals but is winning rave reviews on Wall Street and in academia . Many Republicans are thrilled . <p> " We need to bring together the best minds in America to guide us , " Obama said in Chicago as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrate a reach for deep experience and sterling credentials to try to prevent the crisis from destroying his presidency . <p> " It 's an all-star team , " said Barry Eichengreen , an economics colleague of Romer and an expert on financial crises at UC Berkeley . " Christy Romer 's credentials are impeccable . ... I think we should be reassured that they are picking really first-class intellects to grapple with our problems . " <p> With the government rescue of banking giant Citigroup on Monday , economic news keeps getting worse . The housing market collapse has infected every sector of the economy and has spread globally . <p> Real estate and stock market losses are hammering consumer spending , which makes up 70 percent of the economy . Falling housing prices crimp bank balance sheets and lending . As demand falls and credit evaporates , businesses are retrenching and dismissing workers , which further constricts demand and causes the loss of more jobs . <p> Obama has moved with record speed to name his economic team , an attempt to calm markets during the long interregnum between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With nearly two months to go before he takes office , Obama said he plans to " hit the ground running " and have an aggressive economic stimulus package , estimated at $500 billion , ready to go by early January . <p> He is coordinating with congressional leaders and spoke with President Bush Monday , saying later that he and the president are in general agreement that " we have to do whatever is required to keep the financial system working and capital flowing . " <p> Many economists believe the economy has fallen into a classic liquidity trap , in which lower interest rates and other monetary policy tools are ineffective . Interest rates on Treasury bills have fallen close to zero , and the Federal Reserve is injecting vast quantities of cash into the banking system , but it has not jolted economic activity , because consumers and businesses are hoarding cash . The famous Depression-era economist John Maynard Keynes , whose theories underlie today 's policymaking , compared monetary policy under such conditions to " pushing on a string . " <p> That is the reasoning behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying goods and services directly to kick-start demand . <p> Such an approach also happens to dovetail with Obama ' s economic plan , devised long before the current crisis , by offering a rationale for government spending on alternative energy , infrastructure , education and health care . <p> The crisis actually could help Obama implement his agenda by weakening political resistance to the breathtaking rise in the projected federal deficit , which already has promised to hit the $1 trillion milestone next year . With an even larger stimulus in the works , the deficit could approach a stunning $1.5 trillion . <p> Last year , the deficit was $162 billion , a five-year low . The record budget deficit was $413 billion in fiscal 2004 . <p> Obama said Monday that he intends to do just that , describing an aggressive stimulus as a down payment on his economic agenda , ticking off clean energy , health care and education . " Not only do I want the stimulus package to deal with the immediate crisis , " Obama said , " I want it also to lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To convert such spending to an economic stimulus , however , is " harder to do than it sounds , " said Bruce Bartlett , a Treasury official in the George H.W. Bush administration and domestic policy adviser to President Ronald Reagan . " The government has to spend money on real stuff . It has to buy concrete and glass and steel and cars and computers , to get spending mobilized to where it will have an impact on the economy . " <p> But mobilizing big projects takes time . A new bridge can not be thrown up in a day ; it requires planning , permits and engineering . <p> Another hitch , said Bartlett , is that other financial bombs may be lurking around the corner that will require vast sums , from shoring up federal guarantees of pensions and bank deposits , to aiding states and cities whose budgets are being sharply squeezed . Such rescues , like the $700 billion bank rescue plan that Congress passed in October and has already been half spent , may help stabilize institutions but does little to encourage new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's deflationary " lost decade " of the 1990s , when banks were saddled with toxic assets after the collapse of real-estate and stock-market bubbles . The economy remained stagnant even as the central bank reduced interest rates to nearly zero and the government spent lavishly on public works projects , accumulating enormous debt . <p> With a gargantuan deficit inevitable next year , Eichengreen said it would be reassuring if the Obama administration also began planning to tackle the budget hangover after the crisis by outlining how to pay down the debt . <p> One little noticed area that could benefit from aid is the municipal bond market , which provides local governments with financing for capital projects . Experts said fears about creditworthiness have sent interest rates soaring on municipal bonds , despite their tax exemption . Many of those projects are now on hold for lack of funding . <p> " The muni sector is a mess , " said James Angel , a finance professor at Georgetown University . " All across the country , we 're seeing this or that project delayed because the financing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could get the muni market running . A lot of municipal bonds finance fundamental infrastructure - roads , bridges , schools , all the long-term capital projects our country can actually use . That 's what 's being put on hold by the credit crunch . " <p> While Republicans were praising Obama economic team Sen. Judd Gregg , R-N.H. , said Obama demonstrated strong and early leadership by his choices , liberals were more skeptical . Noting the heavy reliance on Clinton administration officials , including Geithner , 47 , and Summers , 53 , Dean Baker , co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research , said both men " supported policies that got us here . They were big fans of financial deregulation , they did n't take the financial bubble seriously - back then it was the stock-market bubble , but they said asset bubbles were not a big deal . The hope is they 've learned something , and that remains to be seen .
