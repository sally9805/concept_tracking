The sassy star of Live with Regis and Kelly on the joy of her baby girl , passionate fights with her hot-blooded husband , and letting go of her fears I By Kate Coyne // What a difference a year makes . It 's barely 12 months since Kelly Ripa became Regis Philbin 's freshfaced sidekick on Live with Regis and Kelly but in that time nearly everything in Ripas life has been transformed-from the size of her family to the color of her hair to the space in her dressing room . Once filled with relics from the reign of predecessor Kathie Lee Gifford , it is now bursting at the seams with Kelly clutter . One wall is consumed by a playpen and bassinet , a nod to the major change in Ripa 's life : the birth , last June , of her second child , Lola Grace . Photos of Lola and her four-year-old brother , Michael , cover nearly every surface . Prominent among them is a framed portrait of Ripa 's husband , actor Mark Consuelos , holding the two children in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from JCPenney ! " Ripa says excitedly . " Seriously , they 're the best ! They have the biggest selection of backdrops . And they bring the photo right up onto a computer screen and ask if you like it or want to take more ! " Ripa now sports a sleek blond bob ( she would n't dye her hair while pregnant but quips , " I had bleach on my scalp five minutes after Lola was born " ) , and while it 's hard to imagine her waiting on line at the mall with other doting moms , she insists her newfound fame has had little effect on her . " I think you 're really only as famous as you want to be , " she says . " And there 's a world of difference between someone who is movie-star famous and me . Mark and I do everything exactly as we 've done it before . " Besides , she says , " I 'm rarely recognized . And if I am , I 'm called either Regis-I 'm not kidding , they point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm the girl without a name . " Photograph Many moods : Kelly laughing with Regis , top , and fighting back on All My Children , bottom Photograph Many moods : Kelly laughing with Regis , top , and fighting back on All My Children , bottom Photograph Photograph Michael and Lola on the Consuelos family Christmas card // Still , it would be understandable if Ripa chose to surround herself with an entourage . She is , after all , juggling two kids and two jobs : In addition to Live , she continues in her role as Hayley Vaughan Santos on the daytime drama All My Children , in which her dashing husband Mark plays her dashing husband Mateo . She has Lola , whom she is breast-feeding , backstage with her many mornings , and Michael is a common after-school fixture around the ABC offices . Later today , she and Mark will take Lola to the doctor ; the little girl has a nagging cough , which sounds suspiciously like bronchitis . Now , surrounded by Christmas presents waiting to be wrapped , Ripa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the gifts herself " Like I 'm gon na have an assistant do it ? " she says incredulously . " They 're not from her , they 're from me ! " Settling down with a pair of scissors and some tape , Kelly Consuelos ( " To me and to my friends and family , that 's my name " ) is not only ready for the holidays , she 's ready to speak her mind . On Lola and having one more " Both of my kids came out looking just like my husband , with this jet-black hair . Lola , though , has blue eyes . And Mark , looking right at my face , actually said in amazement , " I think she has blue eyes ! Where did they come from ? ' I said to him , 11 do n't want to alarm you , but we think I 'm her mother . I may have something to do with it . ' My husband is so in love with Lola . Right after she was born , he went out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' ' ... and there was nobody out there . It was six in the morning ! All the nurses were saying to me , There 's a new woman in his life , look out ! ' And it 's true . He will never let her go out on a date . Never . She 'll be in a convent . Michael is also very protective : That 's my sister . Do n't touch her . ' This girl is never going to have any boyfriends . We 're much more relaxed with Lola than with our firstborn . With Michael we would make people boil themselves before they could hold him . With Lola , I 'm asking taxicab drivers to hold her while I hunt for my wallet . And Lola , if I can brag for a minute , is a really good baby . She sleeps through the night , she does n't fuss . We had practically never heard her cry , until I accidentally clipped her fingernails too short and she bled . I mentioned that on the show , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have thought that I had kidnapped a school bus full of children . As for losing the baby weight , I 've said it before , and I 'll say it again . If you want to take off your baby weight , then you should breast-feed , because it really speeds things along . Honestly , it revs up your metabolism or something . But it 's odd because I always think I look so great after I give birth . Then a week later I see the pictures and I say , Who took this of me with eight chins ? ' Right now I feel good , though I 'm really not in very good shape . I 've learned that if you wear things tight enough , it sort of holds it all together and gives you the illusion of fitness . But my husband truly loves me as is . It really does n't matter to him if it 's tight , firm , big , small . And as long as my husband 's happy , I do n't care . We would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started talking about it instantly . But at first Mark was saying , You know , two is a nice even number . We have a girl ; we have a boy . They 're healthy . Let 's not ask for anything else . ' But then my girlfriend had twins and we went to see them . Mark and I stepped into the maternity ward and we heard the scream of a newborn , and he turned to me and said , OK , you talked me into it . We can have one more . ' So now I have his endorsement . In a few years , we 'll try . If God wants us to have a third , we 'll have a third . If not , we wo n't . " Photograph // On raising a smart son " I want my kids to know that they live in the real world . Michael gets so many special things now , and he needs to know that there are children who do n't have toys who could really use them , and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and believe me , it 's a fight . The no word is something he does n't hear often enough . Here 's an example : We were in Disney World , doing a week of Live shows down there . Michael and I are leaving the park to meet his grandparents , my in-laws , for dinner , and we walk past this stand selling rubber crocodiles . My sons biggest passion is crocodiles . We had to bring his rubber crocodile from home on this trip , and he has about ten rubber crocodiles already . But he sees this new crocodile and says , Mommy , I want this crocodile ! Please , Mommy , please ! ' I say , No . You already have a crocodile . It 's at the hotel room . ' He grabs the crocodile and tries to walk away . So I grab him . Now I notice that some people are definitely capturing these moments on video recorders and cameras . I say , Michael , put down the crocodile ! We 're leaving . ' And he shouts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say , through gritted teeth , Put that crocodile down now , and we 'll discuss this when we leave the park . ' Now I 'm in a predicament . People are saying , Hey , are n't you Kathie Lee from the Regis show ? ' while they 're noticing this scene . And my son , who 's a smart kid , is noticing people noticing . He figures I 'm not going to lose it in front of all these people . But he underestimated my ability to lose it . I throw the crocodile down and say , We will discuss this in the hotel room . ' I put him on my hip , and I start carrying him out . So he looks around and , at the top of his lungs , he lets out this blood-curdling scream : Somebody help me ! She ! hurting me ! HELP ME ! ' There comes a point in time where you 've just got to say no , and if you do n't stick with it , you 're dead . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could let my son know that when I said no , I meant no . So I kept on walking , and when we got back to the hotel , he had a major time-out . And I think he grasped it . Of course , my father-in-law bought him the crocodile the next day . I got off the set and the crocodile was there , mocking me : Oh , look who 's here ! " On her fiery husband " Mark and I have a great marriage , and a great life together . It 's not boring , and it never has been . I 'm a Libra , and he 's an Aries , so I 'm an air sign , and he 's fire . We 're very combustible . We like to argue . It 's never a vicious argument , but we like to disagree with each other and we love making up even more . He and I say that if you stay married long enough , you eventually will speak without words , and that 's pretty much where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the occasional party , he could just look at me and know when my bladder had had enough ! The other day I heard Oprah Winfrey ask someone on her show if they were living the life that they had imagined for themselves . And I thought , My gosh , I really am . I 'm living a life that has far exceeded what I imagined for myself . ' I can directly that to my husband . " On September 11 " The very first time I came to New York City from my hometown in New Jersey was when I was a little girl , with my grandpa . And the first place we went to was the World Trade Center . We went all the way to the top , and it was just the most amazing place on earth to me . Then , my first year living in the city , when I was nineteen and I had started on All My Children , we had the show 's Christmas party at Windows on the World . That night was what my grandpa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York one day and that I would go to a party like that one in the most amazing room in the whole city . " So now I have such a sense of loss . My loss is never getting to take my daughter up there . I feel like I do n't have the right to feel this way because I 'm a very lucky person . My loss is just a loss of memories . But I have three phobias in my life . I have a fear of fire , I have a fear of heights , and I have a fear of airplanes . And so to see something like this happen ... " Still , I really believe that you either take hold of your fear or it takes hold of you . And it did take hold of me for a time after September 11 . I would go into the shower because I did n't want my kids to see me , and once I was in there I 'd fall into a sort of gaping , openmouthed cry . " That day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those red boots over there . We 've stacked boxes on top of them ; I 'm superstitious in ways that seem sort of odd . I 've gotten rid of the actual outfit I was wearing that day because it just felt cursed , the bad luck outfit . ' " The first week back on the show was impossible . We did nt know what to expect . We decided that we had to go back to the business of making people happy in a lighthearted way . And it seemed to work ; people seemed to need to listen to us talk about nothing . Still , it was very hard . I mean , every commercial break we would cry , and then come on and talk to our guests . " Honestly , after September 11 my impulse was to move somewhere . But then Mark and I sat down and thought about it , and this city has been so good to us . We earn a great living here . We met and had two beautiful children here . I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that New Yorkers are good people that will do anything to help anybody . And the fact that the rest of the country is now privy to that is one truly great thing to come out of something so horrible .
