Mission to Mars <P> " Bush 's Mars plan is an election-year strategy : a weapon of mass distraction designed to divert our attention from the economy . " Gail Moore San Francisco <P> The urge to explore space is in our blood , and only the uneducated can stop us from going Jan. 26 . It is certain we will benefit from the knowledge we gain . We should embark on this venture as part of a cooperative worldwide effort . It sounds like a pipe dream , but there is enough out there for all of us . Robert King Edgerton , Wis . <P> We must aggressively venture into space to exploit the vast resources of other planets and asteroids . It would be the height of stupidity to ignore the opportunity and continue to strip our planet bare . Space exploration is also an insurance policy for humans and other Earth species . We must colonize the moon , Mars and then other worlds to ensure that our species goes on should Earth suffer a cataclysmic disaster . William Hubbell Miami <P> The proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by NASA and the aerospace and defense industries . It will be very expensive , with a low probability of success and very little real scientific value . The same goes for the International Space Station and the Star Wars missile-defense program . It 's time we demand real results and use common sense to control reckless , wasteful , political-payoff spending . Truman Hunter Oxford , Ohio <P> As a freedom-loving American , I would gladly back the mission to Mars if the first person to go were President Bush . I am quite certain that we wo n't be able to find Vice President Cheney , or I would insist that he go too . Colleen Stone Merced , Calif . <P> Unless there is some plan to pack billions of dollars into garbage bags and hurl them into space , the Mars project will be essentially a domestic spending program . The bucks will be spent in the good ole U.S. , for the most part . They 'll be used to pay top-notch technicians , engineers and scientists plus manufacturers  --  a worthwhile subsidy indeed . Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in Iraq , and we have no reason to believe they can leave anytime soon ; the economy has major problems ; we are constantly at risk from a terrorist attack . With conditions such as these , only George W. Bush would come up with a stunt like a mission to Mars . It is a slap in the face to our troops , the working class , senior citizens and those of us who are worried we wo n't have Social Security when we retire . Lisa George Shreveport , La . <P> Why should we spend vast amounts to reach Mars when there is a very high chance of its not providing anything that would improve our lot here on Earth ? Why not allocate those billions for " home improvement " ? Think of the progress that could be made in curing cancer , aids and other diseases ; in cleaning our water , air and soil ; and in feeding hungry nations . Why confront the hazards of outer space when we should be fighting homelessness , poverty and unemployment on Earth ? Corey Brunish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty good job thus far of ruining Earth , so is now the time to spoil other planets ? Paul Pugliese Long Branch , N.J.
