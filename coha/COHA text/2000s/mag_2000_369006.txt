Take a look at what your eyes are doing right now . It 's known as saccadic jumping  --  the way they skip across the page from left to right before some unseen hand comes in and pushes them to the start of the next line , like the ball on an old typewriter . It 's something you 've done your whole life . But is it really the most efficient way to read ? <P> Now imagine this : you 're sitting at a computer equipped with a steering wheel , gas pedal , brake and stick shift . Words appear on the screen at a speed you determine by applying the pedals . Your eyes do n't waste time with saccadic jumps , since there 's never more than one word on the screen at a time . The wheel steers you between chapters ; the stick shift takes you to the next book . Before you know it , your brain has become some kind of jet-powered Maserati . Reading regular text , you 're considered fleet of eye if you hit 400 words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speeder Reader , test subjects have been known to manage 2,000 words a minute . <P> Which does n't mean we 're all going to spend the 21st century treating books like NASCAR racetracks . But as an effective tool for cramming large chunks of information ( the technology it is based on is already a big hit with law students ) , Speeder Reader is proof positive that we also do n't have to treat books like slabs of paper that sit on shelves anymore . Printed text , which has remained basically unchanged since Gutenberg first got his fingers inky , is about to bloom into a thousand different forms . The one you use will increasingly depend on what you need to use it for . " The tyranny of the static book is over , " says Rich Gold , head of the Research on Experimental Documents ( RED ) team at Xerox PARC . " The digital revolution can incorporate radical new visions of reading . " <P> Reinventing the book ? It 's not the kind of thing you 'd expect to find preoccupying even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( it stands for Palo Alto Research Center ) is the kind of place that prides itself on overturning assumptions . For one , there are no lone nuts tinkering away in silent labs . Teamwork takes priority here  --  and as history suggests , there 's nothing more powerful than the feedback effect of inventors riffing off one another 's work . <P> The PARC has a pretty good track record when it comes to radical new visions , even if its record of holding onto them has been spotty at best . The mouse , the GUI ( graphical user interface , like Windows ) and arguably the PC itself were all born in this hothouse of Silicon Valley R. and D. ; they ended up making a lot of money for Apple and Microsoft . Xerox has got a lot of prestige but little cash out of the PARC , which is why the beleaguered copier giant intimated in October that it would put its crown jewel up for sale to help stem billion-dollar losses .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
