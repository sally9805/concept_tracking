The word evil  --  brandished so often by George W. Bush and just as regularly scorned by those who oppose him  --  could use some serious parsing . <P> It is possible that neither side in the debate about evil quite knows what it is talking about . Philosophically and theologically , both are fighting the last war . They are talking about a world that no longer exists , or rather , they fail to see what evil lies in the world that now exists . <P> President Bush uses the word in an in-your-face , born-again manner that takes its resonance from a long Judeo-Christian tradition that sees radical evil embodied in heroically diabolical figures . This personalized evil is the kind that is insinuated by the sauntering Tempter in the first scene of the Book of Job , when God and Satan speculate like racing touts about whether Job can go a mile and a quarter on a muddy track . In Bush 's usage , evil has the perverse prestige of Milton 's defiant Lucifer . Evil emanates , implicitly , from a devilish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality , God 's rival in the cosmos , condemned to lose the fight ( eventually ) but powerful in the world . <P> Bush 's critics , hearing the word , go ironic . They put evil in quotes and think of Dana Carvey 's Church Lady : " Well , is n't that special , Saddam ? Who 's your little friend ? Could it be Satan ! ! ! ? ? ? " They mock Bush for what they see as a primitive , frightening and atavistic use of a medieval term that should probably be banished from civilized discourse in a multicultural world . <P> Evil , these critics say , is in any case such an elusive term that it can only cause mischief in human affairs and has a way of evaporating  --  or turning into something else as time passes . Toward the end of World War I , when labor unions threatened strikes in England , Minister of Munitions Winston Churchill sternly blamed " evil and subterranean influences , " meaning , he said , " pacifism , defeatism and Bolshevism . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which slaughtered an entire generation of Europe 's young men , were obdurate military stupidity , the effectiveness of newly industrialized war and a monstrous official indifference to the value of human life . ( A neglected dimension of evil , by the way , is stupidity . ) <P> But even if it 's elusive and even if the term is used brainlessly , evil is still there  --  a mystery , a black hole into which reason and sunshine vanish but nonetheless ... there . Talk to the children with chopped-off hands in Sierra Leone . It is as fatuous to deny the existence of evil as it is to toss the word around irresponsibly . The children of the Enlightenment sometimes have an inadequate understanding of the possibilities of the Endarkenment . The question is how evil exists , how it works .
