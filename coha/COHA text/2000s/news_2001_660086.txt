<p> David Shoup is a real stand-out at Jackson State University . It 's not Mr. Shoup 's academic wiles or athletic prowess that set him apart . It 's that he 's a white student on a Mississippi campus that is 95 percent black . Standing out is a small price to pay , though , for this father of two : He landed a " diversity scholarship " and attends Jackson State for free . His school and two other black state-funded colleges are at the center of the longest-running racial-bias case in US education - one that after 26 years is about to be settled in a way that satisfies almost no one , and may even threaten the existence of at least one black college . The lawsuit , originally brought to force Mississippi to spend on black colleges what it spent on colleges attended primarily by whites , has evolved over the years into something resembling a reverse-discrimination case . Indeed , as part of a forthcoming settlement - in which the three black colleges are expected to get $ 500 million in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to diversify their student bodies . But here on the waterlogged country of the Mississippi Delta , where racial stigmas can still run deep , many expect the schools to have a tough time attracting enough whites to meet the court 's requirements . " To put the onus on black schools to meet quotas in order to get these endowments is a slap in the face of what the lawsuit was all about , " says Erik Fleming , a state legislator and a Jackson State alum . Ultimately , the case may set a precedent - and prompt more than 50 other black colleges in 19 states to review their own enrollment rules . " What you have going on in Mississippi right now is the endgame of desegregation , " says Robert Kronley , a consultant for the Southern Education Foundation in Atlanta . " People all over the country are watching this very carefully . " In an ironic twist , the pending settlement , which could come as soon as this week , may set racial quotas at black state colleges - even as colleges elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District Judge Neal Biggers Jr . approves the deal , Mississippi will hold onto $ 100 million of the total award until the black colleges meet a 10 percent " other race " enrollment . In addition , they must uphold the state 's admission standards for new students . The settlement stems from a 1992 US Supreme Court ruling on the case , which ordered Judge Biggers to remove " all vestiges of segregation " from state schools , while recompensing the three historically black schools - Jackson State , Alcorn State , and Mississippi Valley - for past funding inequities . By shortchanging black schools over 70 years , some say , Mississippi has been able to build the reputations of predominantly white schools such as Ole Miss in Oxford . Indeed , the original suit , filed in 1975 by the late Jake Ayers Sr. , a Jackson State parent , was brought to end the perceived inequity . From the schools ' view , the requirement to raise enrollment standards is just as worrisome as quotas . Imposing those standards could close Mississippi Valley State University in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some of the worst schools in the country . In the past , black colleges could admit students whose academic performances were substandard if they excelled at other activities , such as sports or music . In the state Legislature , a majority of the black caucus has lifted its opposition to the settlement in an effort to finally put an end to the case . They fell in behind three of the state 's most powerful black leaders , including US Rep. Bennie Thompson ( D ) . " We need to move forward , " says an employee of Alcorn State University . Elsewhere , some historically black colleges are already taking steps to diversify . Tennessee State University in Nashville is trying to achieve a 50-50 racial balance on its campus - a goal many see as impossible . North Carolina Central University in Durham has increased its diversity by acquiring a law school . Today dozens of white law clerks and lawyers working in Raleigh have N.C. Central diplomas hanging on their office walls . <p> But on the Mississippi Delta , the going has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past decade on diversity programs , but the results were so underwhelming that Judge Biggers punished the schools by withholding $ 3 million earmarked for other projects . Years of underfunding have given the schools a bad name , turning them into " racial enclaves , " says Mr. Kronley . That can benefit black students , who say small classes and lots of individual attention help them catch up . Moreover , most of the faculty is African-American , many of them first-generation degree holders who understand the black community 's struggles . Some white students , especially immigrants , say the African-American social culture is refreshing . But many others are put off and intimidated by sharp differences in behavior and school rituals . On Jackson State 's commons , fraternity brothers break down a bold beat , dancing and chanting . Caddies roll by , subwoofers in the trunk pumping out hip-hop rhythms loud enough to rattle the thick steel doors . " In any given class , there might be one white student besides me , " says Shoup . " I do n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " On the other hand , freshman Antony Schwartz , from India , likes to learn about African-American culture . " They talk a lot about civil rights issues and show movies about slavery , " he says . " A lot of it is very interesting . " So far , many " other race " students at Mississippi 's black state schools come from Korea , India , or Russia . Most , in fact , are nontraditional students , not undergraduates fresh out of high school . At Alcorn State , the country 's oldest black land-grant college , the state championship tennis team was led by an exchange student from Russia . While Alcorn and Mississippi Valley struggle to find a core of white , rural students from which to draw , Jackson State has its own enrollment strait : The school is a neat oasis in a slowly crumbling combat zone . Nearly 12,000 people have left downtown Jackson in the past decade , leaving behind closed-up motels and dim lounges on nearly every corner . The first time Shoup came to Jackson , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block away as he walked back to his car . " The neighborhood is not only a problem for white parents , it scares black parents , too , " says Mr. Fleming , the state lawmaker . Still , many of the stigmas about Mississippi 's black colleges are unwarranted . The three schools count nearly all of the state 's black legislative caucus as alumni . Alcorn is a well-known producer of doctors , and Jackson is a top computer-science school . Football great Jerry Rice went to Mississippi Valley . The new Education secretary , Rod Paige , is a Jackson State grad . Diversity is a demand black schools do n't usually direct at themselves , but many say it may yet benefit students and the institutions . " It 's good for white students to see how the other half lives and plays , " says Lee Terry Moore , an Alcorn senior . But Caleph Wilson , a junior , says it will be difficult for his college to get out from under segregation 's long shadow . " I do n't have a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Wilson says . " But the fact is that our schools are still taboo to most white people . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 . The Christian Science Monitor
