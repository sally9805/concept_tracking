WE LIVE ON FAITH , " MY father used to say . " The afterlife is all we have . " <p> I was n't sure of any afterlife . My questions troubled my father , who was pastor of our little church . He made me kneel with him to pray and listen to long chapters from the Bible on the altar . That sacred book , he said , had come from the holy Mother Earth . It looked old enough , the brittle yellow pages breaking loose from the cracked leather binding , but if its miracles had ever really happened , that had been a hundred light-years away and long millennia ago . <p> " If there is a God , " I told him , " and if he heard our prayers , we 'd all be dead before we ever got his answer . " <p> With an air of tragic sorrow , he warned me that such reckless words could put my immortal soul in danger . <p> " We ourselves are miracles , " he told me , " happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miraculous answer to the prayers of the first Earthmen to land here . They found it rich in everything , and spoiled it with their own greed and folly . " <p> I heard the history of that from our one-legged schoolmaster . Our first dozen centuries had been a golden age . We settled both great continents , harvested the great forests , loaded fleets of space freighters with precious hardwoods and rare metals . All that wealth was gone two thousand years ago . <p> Sadly , he showed us a few precious relics he kept in the dusty cupboard he called a museum . There was a little glass tube that he said had shone with the light of a hundred candles when there was power to make it burn , and a dusty telephone that once had talked around the world . <p> We were born poor , in a poor little village . On the Sabbaths , my father preached in the adobe-walled church . On weekdays , he got into his dusty work clothes and ground corn on a little grist mill turned by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal . <p> Wheat grew on the flat land down in the valley below us , but the soil in our hill country had eroded too badly for wheat . Through most of the week we ate cornmeal mush for breakfast and corn pones for bread . Sometimes my mother made white bread or even honey cakes , when church members from the valley gave us wheat flour . <p> On the Sabbaths she played a wheezy old organ to accompany the hymns . I used to love the music and the promise of a paradise where the just and good would live happily forever , but now I saw no reason to believe it . With no life here at home , I longed to get away into the wider universe , but I saw no chance of that . <p> It 's seven light-years to the nearest settled star system . The trade ships quit coming long ago , because we had nothing left to trade . There 's only the mail ship , once every Earth year . It arrives nearly empty and leaves with every sling filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It lands at the old capitol , far across the continent . I 'd never been there , nor seen any kind of starship till the year I turned twelve . That quiet Sabbath morning , the rest of the family was gone in the wagon with my father to a revival meeting in another village down the river . Expecting no miracle there or anywhere , I 'd been happy to stay home and do the chores . <p> Awakened by a rooster crowing , I was walking out to the barn to milk our three cows . I heard something thundering across the sky . In a moment I found it , a flash of silver when it caught the sun . I dropped the milk bucket , staring while it wheeled low over the crumbled ruins of something that had stood on the hill west of us . <p> It turned and dived straight at me . <p> With no time to run , I stood frozen while it sank over the west pasture and the apple orchard . It struck the cornfield and plowed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped at the edge of my mother 's kitchen . Its thunder ceased . It lay still , a smoking mass of broken metal . <p> I stood there watching , waiting for something more to happen . Nothing did . I caught my breath at last , and walked uneasily toward it . Nothing about it made any kind of sense until I looked into the long furrow it had dug and found a torn and bleeding human arm . A leg farther on , most of the skin torn off . Another naked leg , still attached to the mangled body . Finally a hairless skull grinning from the bottom of the ditch . <p> Dazed by the sudden strangeness of it , I thought I ought to call my father or the constable or the schoolmaster , but they were all away at the revival . I was still there , wondering what to do , when I saw a carrion bird hovering over the body . I shouted and threw stones to keep it away till some of the neighbors came from up the river . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my milk bucket , and carried them into the church . <p> The sheriff came on horseback , the doctor with him . They frowned over the body parts , laid out on a long table made of planks laid across the benches . The doctor fitted them closer together to see if anything was missing . The sheriff picked up pieces of broken metal , scowled at them uneasily , threw them back in the ditch . <p> They all left at last , for their dinners or whatever they had to do . I think they were afraid of too much they did n't understand . So was I , but I did n't like the flies buzzing around the body . I went home for a sheet to cover it . After a cold corn pone and a bowl of clabbered milk for lunch , I came back to look at the wreck again , and watch the empty sky . Nothing else came down . <p> Evening came . I milked the cows again , fed the pig , found a dozen eggs in the nests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church to be certain the door was closed . Night fell as I was walking home . Our planet has no moon . In the sudden darkness , the stars were a blaze of diamonds . <p> I stopped to look up at them , wondering about the stranger . Where was his home ? Why had he come here ? What could have gone so terribly wrong when he tried to land ? The answers were beyond me , but I stood there a long time , wishing I 'd been born somewhere else , with a chance to see worlds more exciting than our own . <p> In the empty house , I lit a candle , ate another corn pone and a piece of fried chicken my mother had left for me , went to bed . Trying to forget the vulture circling over that skinned skull in the ditch , I lay listening to the tick of the old clock in the hall till I heard the rattle of my father 's wagon . <p> My mother and my sister came in the house while he drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger stopped their chatter about the meeting . My father lit a candle lantern when he heard about it , and we all walked across the road to the church . My mother lifted the sheet to look at the body . <p> She screamed and my father dropped the lantern . <p> " Alive ! It 's alive ! " <p> The candle had gone out . I shivered when I heard some small creature scurry away in the dark . My father 's hands must have been shaking , it took him a long time to find a match to light the candle again . The long naked body was a man 's , black with dried blood and horribly scarred , but somehow whole again . <p> The bald skull had hair again , a short pale fuzz . The eyes were open , staring blindly up into the dark . The body seemed stiff and hard , but I saw the blood-caked chest rise and slowly fall . My mother reached to touch it , and said she felt a heartbeat . <p> My father made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to hammer at the door a long time before he came out in his underwear to call me crazy for waking him in the middle of the night with such a cock-andbull story . If we had a live man there at the church , it had to be some drunk who had crept inside to sober up . <p> Still angry , he finally dressed and saddled a horse to come back with me . My mother had lit candles at the altar . My father was on his knees before it , praying . The doctor threw the sheet off the man , felt his wrist , and said he 'd be damned . <p> " The hand of God ! " my father whispered , backing away and dropping back to his knees . " A holy miracle ! We prayed at the meeting for a sign to help us persuade the unbelievers . And the good Lord has answered ! " <p> " Maybe . " The doctor squinted at me . " Or is it some trick of Satan ? " <p> My mother brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clots of blood and mud . His eyes closed , the man seemed to be sleeping . He woke when day came , and sat up to stare blankly at the empty benches around him . His blond hair and beard had grown longer . The scars had disappeared . <p> My mother asked how he felt . <p> He blinked at her and shivered , wrapping the sheet around himself . <p> " Are you the Son of God ? " My father knelt before him . " Have you come to save the world ? " <p> He shook his head in a puzzled way . <p> My mother asked if he was hungry . He nodded , and rose unsteadily when she asked if he could . She took his hand and led him out of the church and down the street to our house . He limped slowly beside her , peering around him as if everything was strange . <p> " Sir ? " The doctor came up beside him . " Can you tell us who you are ? " <p> He made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At our house , my mother brought him a glass and a pitcher of apple juice . He gulped it thirstily and sat watching her fix breakfast . My father brought clothing for him , and a pair of shoes . He sat frowning at them and finally stood up to dress himself , slow and clumsy about it , and let me tie the shoes . <p> " Sir ? " The doctor stood watching . " Where are you from ? " <p> " Earth . " He spoke at last , his voice deep and slow . " I am here from Mother Earth . " <p> My mother set a plate for him . He studied the knife and fork as if they were new to him , but plied them ravenously when she brought a platter of ham and scrambled eggs . She had set plates for the doctor and my father , but they forgot to eat . <p> " You were dead . " My father was hoarse with awe . " How can you live again ? " <p> " I was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ham . " I am eternal . " <p> " Eternal ? " The doctor blinked and squinted at him . " Do you mean immortal ? " <p> " I - " He paused as if he had to search for words . " I do not die . " <p> " I saw you dead . " The doctor swallowed hard and watched him slice the ham . " What brought you back ? " <p> " The power . " Smiling as though glad to find what to say , he wiped his lips with a slice of white bread . " The immortal power that moves the mortal body . " <p> " I see , " the doctor muttered , as if he really did . " Why are you here ? " <p> " If immortality interests you , that is what I bring . " <p> The doctor blinked , startled into silence . My father muttered something under his breath and moved to a chair across the room . My mother had made a pot of tea . The man drained a tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow stronger and brighter , he began asking questions . He wanted to know about our history , cities , industries , governments , ways of travel . Did ships from Earth ever land here ? I thought he looked pleased that the mail skipper was not due soon . Our neighbors had crowded the kitchen by then , and we all moved into the front room . Somebody asked his name . <p> " Who cares ? " He shrugged , standing tall in the middle of the room . " Your world is new to me . I come to you as a new man , an agent of eternity . I bring you the gift of eternal life . " <p> " Eternal ? " The doctor had recovered his voice . " Just what do you mean ? IP <p> " My secrets are my own . " He was suddenly smiling , his voice resonant and strong . " But if you wish to live forever , follow me . " <p> Too many people had pushed into our house by then , and the blacksmith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stubbornly , my father shook his head . <p> " I do n't know what he is , but he claims no power from God . He could be a son of Satan , scheming to trap our souls for hell . I do n't want him in my church . Get him out of my house ! " <p> " He 's slick as a barrel of eels , " the doctor agreed . " I would n't believe him if he swore the sun came up this morning . But I don't- " He shrugged uneasily toward the wreckage in the cornfield . " I want to know more about him . " <p> The sheriff escorted him to a vacant lot . My father stayed away , but I followed with my sister . The sheriff helped him to the top of an old stone slab that must have supported some public monument when our world was great . We all crowded around . He stood silent while the blacksmith spoke to tell how he had risen from the dead . The murmur of voices died into breathless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a dog barking somewhere , and a rooster crowing . I thought he looked handsome , even in the misfit garments . <p> " He ca n't be the demon Dad says he is . " I saw a glow of awed admiration on my sister 's face . " I believe he 's an angel sent from Heaven to save us . " <p> He spread his arms to beckon us closer . <p> " I see that your world has suffered misfortune . " <p> His voice rang loud and clear , but he paused to gesture at the muddy ruts we called a street and our straggle of mud-walled , straw-roofed homes . He turned to nod at the rubble mounds of what had been a city on the hill behind him . <p> " I knew poverty like yours back on the mother world . It is ruled by the rich . They live in great mansions , with swarms of servants and every luxury . Skipping time on space flights to their estates on other planets , they stretch their lives almost forever . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Microbots ? " the doctor shouted . " What are they ? " <p> " Tiny robots . " He slowed his voice to help us understand . " They circulate like cells in the blood , repairing all the damage of illness and age . Their owners are immortal , gathering wealth and knowledge and power as they live though century after century . They have everything . <p> " We mortals were poor as you are . " <p> He shrugged at the shabby streets with a grimace of remembered pain . <p> " Poorer , because they have kept us down , generation after generation born to toil and die in ignorance of all that might have helped us . To keep us humble , they have allowed us to learn no more than our tasks required . Most have no escape except to breed another generation to suffer and die as we have always done . <p> " I was lucky . My mother 's husband worked as a janitor in a university that taught the children of the rich . He stole books and holo cubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housemaid for an immortal scientist . They had an affair they never confessed , but my mother told me I am his son . <p> He made me his lab assistant when I was old enough , finally made me his subject for the experiment that made me eternal . " <p> I heard a buzz of excitement in the crowd , and then a volley of breathless questions . <p> " If you do n't believe , ask those who saw me arrive . " He paused to let his eyes search out the doctor , the sheriff , me . " They saw my body heal from what they thought was death . " <p> " I saw a dead man , " the doctor muttered uneasily . " But I do n't know how - " <p> His voice trailed off . <p> " I 'll tell you how . " The stranger smiled , and his voice pealed louder . <p> " I bring you my father 's secret gift to me , something simpler than the microbots and a better way to immortality . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken laws to keep the microbots for themselves forever . <p> " They raided and wrecked my father 's lab , left me for dead . I recovered . My mother brought me the keys to his private skipship . I am not a pilot , but I had watched him drive the ship . The robotic controls got me here , though I botched the landing and injured myself . " <p> Wryly , he gestured toward the twisted metal in the cornfield . <p> " You have seen how I recovered . " <p> He spread his arms again and posed to display his body . Splendid now , it showed no scars . I saw a flash of gold from his hair , now grown almost to his shoulders , and heard a soft cry from my sister . Awe had hushed the crowd . Far off , I heard the rooster crow again . <p> " A child of God ! " my sister whispered . " Here to save us ! " <p> People stood frozen for a moment , then pushed anxiously closer . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me whole again ? " That was the blacksmith 's crippled son , caked with smoke and sweat from the forge . " How can we repay you ? " <p> " Just follow me , " he said . " Do as I say . " <p> He had brought his gift for all mankind , he said . He wanted to carry it on to the capitol . The blacksmith passed a hat for money to buy him a horse . The tailor gave him a jacket . The sheriff deputized the schoolmaster to be his bodyguard and show him the way . He slept that night at the doctor 's house . When he left next morning , the doctor , the blacksmith , and the schoolmaster rode away with him . My sister came out with me to watch them go by . She broke into tears as they passed . <p> " An angel ! " she whispered . " I 'd die to be with him . " <p> She stood in the dusty street looking after them till he was gone from sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to return . He never did . She grew up to be a beautiful woman and the mistress of our one-room school . The blacksmith 's son courted her devotedly , but she never forgot the stranger . <p> An artist of some talent , she painted a portrait of him , standing on a planet out in starry space , a golden halo shining above his head . It hung in her room , above a candle and a scrap of twisted metal from his ship . Once I caught her kneeling to it . <p> With nowhere else to go , most of us stayed at home in the village . The doctor 's young bride learned to make her living as a midwife . The blacksmith 's son got his younger brother to help at the forge and became a smith himself . News moves slowly on our planet , but we began to hear tales of the miraculous Agent who had risen from death , won new believers by the thousand , built a magnificent Temple of Eternity at the capitol . My sister longed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called him the Agent of Satan . <p> The doctor and the schoolmaster returned at last , in a coach drawn by four fine black horses , a uniformed driver seated in front and a footman standing behind . Another four-horse team pulled a long , black-painted wagon . They stopped on the village square . Half a dozen men in long black robes climbed out of the wagon to set up a platform on one side of the coach and a black tent on the other . They unpacked drums and trumpets and instruments I had never seen , and brought the street to life with music I had never heard . <p> When a curious crowd had gathered , the schoolmaster hopped out of the black wagon , still nimble on his wooden leg . No longer the shabby little mouse I remembered , he was robed in gold and black velvet . <p> " My father ? " The blacksmith 's son limped anxiously to meet him . <p> " Is he coming home ? " <p> The trumpets drowned anything the schoolmaster said . <p> " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The schoolmaster waved his hand . The music stopped , and he lifted his voice for the rest of us . " Alive forever , safe in Eternity . " <p> He strutted to the coach and climbed to stand on the driver 's seat . His voice pealed louder . Our village was a sacred place , he said , because here the Agent had died and risen again from death . He and the doctor had been blessed to witness that first miracle . As chosen Voices of Eternity , they had now returned to share the blessing of eternal life with all of their old friends who wished it . <p> My father had pushed to the front of the crowd . <p> " By what power , and by what name , " he demanded , " do you preach the resurrection of the dead ? " <p> " The Agent has power enough of his own . " Glaring down at him , schoolmaster waved as if to knock him aside . " He needs no other name , and some of you here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by his true names , " my father shouted . " Satan ! Lucifer ! Beelzebub ! The Prince of Darkness ! " He dropped his voice . " I am sorry to hear you repeating his lies , because all of you were once true children of our true Lord . I beg you to repent and confess , that your mortal sins may be blotted out - " <p> The schoolmaster gestured , and a bray of trumpets drowned the words . <p> " You call yourselves Voices , " my father tried again . " I beg you to listen for the voice of God . Listen to Him in your hearts , speaking through the Holy Ghost . " <p> " I never met a holy ghost . " <p> My father flushed red at the mockery . <p> " Listen to the words of Eternity ! " The schoolmaster raised his head to look beyond my father . " We bring you something better than myth and ignorant superstition . I pray you to heed the verities of scientific truth and save your own precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you with open minds , let me lay out the actual facts . " <p> " Facts ? " my father shouted . " Or Satanic lies ? " <p> The blacksmith 's son caught his arm . <p> " The words of the Agent . " The schoolmaster frowned as if we were backward students . " He has taught the simple truth . The veron is an energy particle . Carrying neither mass nor dimension , it is mind without matter . The so-called human soul in fact the veronic being . The Agent has taught us how to liberate it into Eternity . Freed from slavery to the mortal flesh , with all its faults and ills , your immortal minds can live forever . " <p> He paused for a paean of rousing music , and asked for questions when it ceased . <p> What proof could he offer ? <p> " Look inside yourselves . " He paused , with nods and smiles of recognition for my mother and my sister . " Have n't every one of you hated the limits and pains of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from space and time , as you recalled the past , looked into the future , thought of far-off friends ? Those were precious glimpses of your future freedoms in eternity ! <p> " If you want to live forever , step forward now ! " <p> The doctor came down from the coach to a table set up in front of the black tent . Robed like the schoolmaster in gold and black velvet , he had grown grayer and fatter than I recalled him . Silently , he spread his arms to urge us forward . The music rose again . The blacksmith 's deserted wife hobbled toward him . Arthritic and blind , she leaned on her limping son . <p> " Eat . Drink . " Intoning the words , the doctor gestured at a platter and a pitcher on the table . " One little wafer and one small sip of this veronic fluid will break the chains of flesh to set you free . But you must be warned . " <p> He dropped his voice and raised his hands . <p> " This final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the miracle of his resurrection . Once you have felt the joy of eternity , there is no turning back . I must remind you also that you take nothing with you . " <p> Tears washing white channels down his dark-grimed face , the blacksmith 's son shouted the warning into his mother 's ear . She mumbled and opened her mouth . He dropped jingling coins into a basket on the table . The doctor laid a tiny white wafer on her tongue , put a little glass of a blood-red liquid to her drooling lips . She gulped it down . Two men in black took her arms to help her into the tent . <p> Next came the baker 's old and helpless father , moaning on a stretcher carried by the baker and his helper . A dozen others shuffled forward . Finally my sister . Tears on her face , she hugged our mother and our father , darted to startle the blacksmith 's son with a kiss and a quick embrace , and fell into the line . I caught her arm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My father was hoarse with pain . " She has damned herself . " <p> The solemn music rose again . The line crept forward , my sister the last . My father knelt on the ground , murmuring a prayer . My mother stood silently sobbing . My sister dropped something into the basket , the gold necklace and gold earrings the blacksmith 's son had given her . I heard a stifled moan from him . Smiling , she swallowed the wafer and the liquid . My mother cried out , shrill with pain . My sister looked back and tried to speak , but her voice was already gone . Her features stiffened . She staggered . The black robes hustled her into the tent . <p> With a final flourish , the music ceased . The doctor intoned a solemn assurance that these beloved beings were happy now , forever free from grief and care . He and the schoolmaster climbed back into the coach . The musicians dismantled their instruments and knocked down the platform where they had stood . They rolled up the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coach back to the road down the river . <p> The bodies were left lying in a row on the ground . My mother knelt to close my sister 's eyes . My father stood above them to beg the Lord that all their sins and blunders might be forgiven and their souls received into God 's own paradise . Neighbor men toiled all night , nailing coffins together . Next day a pastor came from the village below to preach a farewell service before the boxes were lowered into the row of new graves . <p> One morning next spring , while my mother was making breakfast , we saw a bright silver skipship lying in the cornfield where the stranger 's craft had fallen . Another tall stranger was poking into the tangle of tall weeds and rusted metal where it had stopped . He came across the garden to our door . <p> When I answered his knock , he displayed a holo card that showed the bright round Earth spinning in starry black space . Silver print across it identified him as a field inspector for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked for anything we knew about it .

" We had seen him risen from the dead . She trusted him . " <p> " Satan ! " my father rasped . " He dragged my daughter down to Hell ! " <p> " He was a criminal . " The inspector nodded in sober sympathy . " The tale he told you was largely a hoax . It 's true that he was a native Earthman , but no verons exist , no veronic bodies either . Though he did have microbots in his blood , he had no skills or know-how to share them with anybody else . " <p> Sobbing , my mother rose to leave the room . <p> " Listen to him ! " My father was hoarse with his own emotion . " The Lord will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicious criminal . " 11 Regretfully , the inspector shook his head . " But also the victim of tragedy . He was the offspring of a mortal woman 's illicit affair with an immortal . He inherited his father 's microbots . They should have been destroyed , but that would have crippled or probably killed him . It must have been a desperate choice , but his mother kept him as he was and kept his secret till he was grown . She was arrested when the truth came out , but he escaped in his father 's skipship . I regret the harm he did here , but at least his evil career is over . " <p> " Over ? " My father stared at him . " If he is immortal - " <p> " His church officials will no doubt claim that he 's still alive in some veronic paradise . " The inspector grinned . " But microbots are n't magic . They are only electronic devices . When we located him here , we were able to shut them down with a radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the microbots . His heart stopped when they did . <p> " He will trouble you no longer . " <p> " Thank you , sir . " My father reached over the table to shake his hand . <p> " You have served as a faithful agent of the Lord . " <p> " Or the Pan-Terran Police . " <p> After breakfast , the inspector asked me to clear the weeds around the wreckage to let him take holos of it . He walked with my father over our little farm and wanted to see the farm tools and the mules in the barn . He looked at my mother 's garden and asked about the plants she grew . He had me show him the windmill and the water wheel and the grist mill , and tell him how they worked . <p> He watched me slop the hogs and milk the cows that night , and went with my parents to the hymn service at the church while I stayed home to finish the chores . My mother let him sleep in the room that had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindle the fire in the old cast iron stove and watched my mother fix the breakfast . When we had eaten , he looked sharply at me and asked what I planned for the future . <p> " I never had a future , " I told him . " I always longed to get away , but never had a chance . " <p> " If he had a chance - " He turned to my parents . " Could you let him go ? " <p> They stared at him and whispered together . <p> " If he could really get away- " My mother tried to smile at my father . <p> " We have each other . " <p> My father nodded solemnly . " The Lord 's will be done . " <p> The inspector let his shrewd eyes measure me again . " <p> " It would be forever , " he told me gravely . " As final as death . " <p> " Let him go , " my father said . " He has earned his own salvation .

He had me sit , looked me in the eye , and asked for more about my life . <p> " I stay alive , " I told him . " I 'm the janitor for my father 's church , though I 've never caught his faith . I help him at the mill and help my mother in her garden . " <p> My heart thumping , I waited again until he asked , " Would you like to be immortal ? " <p> Hardly breathing , I found no words to say . <p> " Perhaps you can be , " he said . " If you want the risk . The immortals have to guard their own future . They want no rivals here , but they have agreed to let us send an expedition to colonize the Andromeda galaxy . There 's a two-million-year skip each way , which leaves them safe from any harm from us . " <p> He frowned and shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No skip so far has ever been attempted . It 's a jump into the dark , with no data to let us compute any sure destination . We may be lost forever from our own universe of space , with no way back .

I can sign you on , if you want the chance . " <p> I said I did . <p> My mother dried her tears and kissed me . My father made us kneel and pray together . I hugged them both , and the inspector took me with him to board the departing mother ship . <p> ALL THAT WAS TWO million years ago and two million light-years behind us .
