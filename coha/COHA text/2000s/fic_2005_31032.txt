Max They never list the names . Just the numbers . Every year the school posts the SAT scores in the lobby , where anyone can see them . But they do n't put the names  --  like Jeff Stein got 2340 , Susie Chen got 1160 . They just put the numbers and let you guess who got what . Which , of course , is what everybody does . It 's easier than you think . Like some kids , the math geniuses and future physicists , you can pretty much figure out they 're the 2300s . If someone gets 2400 , it always comes out who it is . " Oh , do n't tell anyone , but I got 2400 . " Yeah , right . Next day everyone 's like , " He got 2400 . He 's going to Yale . " And it 's not too hard to figure out who 's at the bottom of the list . Who got in the 1200s  --  when they give you 600 points just for writing your name . You think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Screw it . " Because some kids do . They say they do n't care what they get , and they mean it . Then there 's everybody else , all clumped together in the middle . The pretty goods , the fines ... also known as the not good enoughs , the not quite acceptables . Last year when I took the PSATs for the first time , I told myself I would n't look at the list . But I did . And there it was : my score . This is where you are , Max . This is how much you count for . Sometimes I think , What 's worse ? Doing just okay , or totally bottoming out ? There 's a weird honor in completely screwing up , in scoring so low that no college 'll take you except the ones that take everyone , including mental cases and paint eaters . The kid at the top has that spot all to himself . But so does the kid at the bottom . When you 're trying to figure out who got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after you got the scores ? Who looked bummed out , who was crying ? Mr. Crowley , our college adviser , always says , " The top colleges can only take so many kids from Dewey . " Only a few of you , maybe even only one of you , are going to get to go to Yale or Harvard . " In other words , like it or not , you 're all in competition with one another . Part I Pick Up Your No. 2 Pencil . Begin . Leo In New York everybody knows everybody else . Well , there are all these people you totally do n't know  --  like cabdrivers and the freaks in the park  --  but they do n't count . The people who count , the kids who go to your school or schools like your school , we all know one another . It 's like a club . " Dalton , check . Prada , check . Summers in Europe or the Hamptons , check . " We all want the same things and we all do the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend you do n't want to go to Yale or Harvard or Brown  --  but you do . Unless you 're a nose picker . In life there are those who count and there are nose pickers . Very few people actually count for anything  --  even though everybody likes to think they do . Anyway , I 'm not surprised when I walk into the SAT prep class in the last week of summer vacation and there 's at least three other kids from Dewey . Without even thinking , I size them up . Daisy Stubbs . Plays b-ball , dates b-ball . Heavily into saving things , from the planet to the guy at the party who thinks it 's a cool idea to mix tequila and schnapps . I 've been to a lot of parties where Daisy 's holding somebody 's head while they puke . She 's a lot of guys ' dream , but I never saw the big deal . Strictly state school . No threat . Of course , next to Daisy is her best bud , Max . Max is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the school paper . He 'd probably tell you it 's all about the game , but it 's like , dude , girls in shorts ? Who are you kidding ? Max is smart . He could be thinking Ivies . Maybe Columbia . Then there 's Jane Cotterell . When she came to our school last year , we were like , " Sweet , Julia Cotterell 's daughter and she passes for a babe . " But Jane speaks to no one . Shy or stuck-up ? Ca n't tell . Guess when your mom 's a movie star , you do n't mix with the little people . Possible threat . But only because of Mom . I take a seat , look around . No sign of the teacher , and it 's almost time to start . While we wait , I open my notebook and start a list , " Five People I Do n't Know Who Count . " 1 . Bill Gates 2 . Quentin Tarantino ( or Steven Soderbergh ) 3 . Bono And maybe , just maybe , Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make us go around and say our names . I hate that . Somebody always asks , " Hey , is your mom Julia Cotterell ? " I have two standard answers : " Um , yeah " or " No , but I get that all the time . " I hardly ever do " Um , yeah , " because then you get , " Oh , I loved her in Persuasion , " or " She totally deserved the Oscar that year . " And then what do you say ? " Thanks " ? My mom would be so on me right now . There are three kids from Dewey here , and she 'd be like , " Why do n't you say hi ? Why do n't you talk to them ? They do n't have fangs , for God 's sake . " Mom , believe me , Daisy and Max would find me utterly boring , and Leo Thayer is a BP who talks only to other BPs . Where is the SAT guy , anyway ? Max Just when I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bald guy sticks his head in the door and gasps , " Ca n't find the booklets . Stay put , I 'll be right back .... " I feel Daisy 's notebook nudge my hand . I look at what she 's written . " It 's a sign . Let 's split . " I write , " Ca n't . Must learn secrets of a , b , c , d , or e . " Daisy scribbles some more . " a . This is lame . b . This is boring . c . This sucks . d . All of the above . e . LET 'S SPLIT ! ! " Last year Daisy and I both said prep was elitist and sick , and we swore we would n't do it . Then we got our PSAT scores , and well , I guess things change . I tell myself everyone does prep . Even Tory McEwan , who got the one perfect score in the school last year , did prep . There 's no shame in it . I just feel ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . He pants , " Just a few more minutes , I 'm arranging for backup . " Then he disappears . Leo Thayer makes a big show of looking at his watch . " That 's ten minutes gone . This one class costs a hundred dollars , this guy owes us each ten bucks . " A girl with pink fingernails who obviously thinks Leo is hot says , " Totally . " I tell myself I do n't hate Leo Thayer because he 's one of the Beautiful People and so many women think he 's hot . I tell myself I hate Leo Thayer because he 's an egotistical schmuck . And I almost believe myself . Then Daisy says loudly , " Screw the ten bucks . Let 's just walk out . " Daisy Well , someone had to say something . I mean , God , we were all just sitting there like , Oh , please , Mr. Brilliant SAT Man , share your wisdom with us . We have paid you hundreds of dollars for the wonderful privilege . And those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screw them . And those who do n't go to private school , screw them , too . I said to my parents , " Does n't it bother you , just a little , how unfair this is ? How the whole system is completely and disgustingly rigged ? " And they were like , " Yeah , but you 're going anyway . " Yay , principles . Last year Coach said she would bench me if I did n't quit arguing with the refs all the time . So I 've been trying not to lose it so much . But this whole scene is just too obnoxious . I say it again : " Let 's walk out . " If this were a movie , this would be the part where the crowd rises up with a huge roar and burns something down . But all that happens is Leo Thayer rolls his eyes and says ... Leo " What , because the guy did n't show ? " Because yeah , I 'm annoyed the guy is late , but that does n't mean Daisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly what she 's thinking . And I 'm sorry , I know some kids go to lousy schools and never learn to read  --  but how is me screwing up my SATs going to help ? I tell her , " You think there should n't be any test at all . Colleges should just take us because we 're nice and kind to animals . Not ' cause we 're ... smart or anything . " Daisy cocks her head like she 's thinking about it . " Well , if we 're so smart , how come we have to pay some jerk to teach us how to take a freaking test ? " She looks me right in the eye , and I have a weird flash . Some party where this girl was following me around , all boo-hoo , because ... I do n't know , she had ideas . She got herself totally trashed , and Daisy took her home . When they were leaving , Daisy looked back at me , and I was like , Not my problem . Daisy gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then and I say now : not mine . Although it 's seriously pissing me off that this guy is so late .... Max Probably most of the kids here think Daisy 's kidding . Yeah , she says " Let 's walk out , " but she does n't really mean it . Except she does . She totally means it . I look around the classroom . Here 's what I see : a bunch of kids who know the whole college game is stacked against kids without money and connections . And ... a bunch of kids with money and connections . All of a sudden Daisy gets up , goes to the front of the class , and says , " Everyone who thinks the SATs are bogus , the time for pizza is now . " Okay , Max . Here 's where you stand up .... I think of my dad : " Hey , how was SAT prep ? " " Uh , well ... " Then all of a sudden I hear this little , tiny voice : " I 'll come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Jane Cotterell ? Daisy sees her too , smiles at me like , Insanity time ... And that 's that . If Jane Cotterell 's walking out , I certainly have to . I stand , say , " I 'm up for pizza . " The rest of the kids stare down at their notebooks . I go stand with Daisy and Jane at the door . Daisy looks back at the class . " Last chance . " Then Leo says , " Screw it , " and gets up . And before anyone has a chance to do anything , Daisy yells , " Sayonara , " and we run out the door . Jane This is wild . I 've never done anything like this . Just leave and slam the door , good-bye ! I 've seen people do it . My mom used to do it all the time when she was fighting with my dad . I wanted to tell her , " Hi , Mom , this is not a movie , we 're not your audience .... " Except this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess they think we 're crazy . I should feel embarrassed , but I do n't . It 's like , You 're the fools . When we get out to the hallway , and we see the SAT guy  --  still looking for his stupid books  --  and Daisy says , " Run for it , " we get nuts running down the hall , charging down the stairs , and someone , I think Max , starts laughing because it 's so nuts , and then we 're all cracking up , even me , and I 'm worried because I 'm running so fast I 'm going to fall down and break my neck , and we jump down the last few stairs , and Leo shoves open the door and waves us all through , and suddenly we 're out on the street and we 're free and ... And I think , Maybe we are crazy . But crazy 's really good . Then Leo says , " Okay , now what ? " Max and Daisy look at each other . If no one says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " You could come to my house . " Leo One of my basic rules in life : Never ever turn down a chance to meet a famous person . So when Jane asks us over , I immediately say , " Sure . " Daisy says , " Yeah , cool . " She 's so psyched she got us all to walk out she 'll agree to anything : " Take a swim in the reservoir ? Yeah , cool .... " Only Max looks doubtful . Probably thinking he 's too dorky to meet Julia Cotterell . He 's right  --  but I 'm not going to let that stand in my way . Max Frankly , I thought once we were out of there , Daisy and I would go and hang on our own . We do n't know these guys . And when it comes to Leo , I seriously do n't want to know him . But somehow we 're all going to Jane Cotterell 's house . Not that Jane is so terrible . But I do n't know her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know she used to hang with Lily Previn , but they do n't seem to be buds this year . And of course , Jane 's insanely gorgeous , and I ca n't speak to insanely gorgeous females . The most I can manage is , " Uh , duh ... " She really looks like her mom , with this cloud of black hair , huge gray eyes . Thin , perfect skin  --  she 's like from another planet where they build everyone perfect . Whereas I 'm from a planet where they build everyone short and weird looking . You do n't want to be supremely uncool and say , " Hey , I saw your mom in the newspaper . " But I do n't know what else to talk to her about . The only other thing I know about Jane is what everyone knows about her . And that you really ca n't talk about . What people say about Jane is that her stepfather watches her naked . They also say she lets him . I have to admit , sometimes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being watched is not the worst thing to think about . Then I look at her face , the way she never really looks anyone in the eye , and I feel like if that 's true , it 's really ugly , and someone should do something . Continues ...
