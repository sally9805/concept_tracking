Single White Vampire By Lynsay Sands Dorchester Publishing Lynsay Sands Thursday , September 12th " Luc , you have unopened mail here from weeks ago . Do n't you read your mail ? And what is this box ? " She lifted the heavy box as if it were feather light and gave it a shake . His brother Bastien burst out laughing , but Lucern merely rolled his eyes at her hen-pecking . No matter how old he got his mother was likely to interfere and hen-peck . It was something he 'd resigned himself to long ago . " I 'll get around to it eventually , " he muttered . " It is mostly nuisance mail or people wanting something from me . " " What about this letter from your publisher ? It 's probably important . They would n't send it express if it were n't . " His scowl deepened as she picked up the Fed Ex envelope and turned it curiously in her hands . " It is not important . My editor is just harassing me . My publisher wishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants you to do a book signing tour ? " She scowled at this news . " I thought you had made it clear to him from the start that you were n't interested in publicity ? " " Not Edwin . No . " He was n't surprised that she recalled his old editor 's name . His mother had a perfect memory , and he 'd mentioned Edwin many times over the ten years that he 'd been writing for Roundhouse Publishing . His first works had been published as historicaltexts and were used mostly in universities and colleges . Those books were still in use and were celebrated for the fact that they were written as if the writer had actually been there experiencing all he wrote . Which , of course , he had . That was hardly public knowledge , though . Lucern 's last three books , however , had been autobiographical in nature , recounting the stories of how his mother and father met and came together , then how his sister Lissianna had met and fallen in love with her therapist husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks ago , covered the story of his brother Etienne and Rachel Garrett . Lucern had n't meant to write them , they 'd just sort of come out of him , and once he 'd written them , he 'd decided that they should be published records for the future . After gaining his family 's permission , he 'd sent them in to Edwin , his editor at the time . That man had thought they were brilliant works of fiction and published them as such . Not just fiction , however , but paranormal romance . Lucern suddenly found himself being sold as a romance writer , which was somewhat distressing for him , so he generally did his best not to think about it . " Edwin is no longer my editor , " he explained . " He died last year . His assistant was given his title and position and has been harassing me ever since . " He scowled again . " The woman is trying to use me to prove herself . She is determined that I should do some publicity events for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to comment , but paused and turned toward the door at the sound of a car pulling into the driveway . Lucern opened the door and the two men watched with varying degrees of surprise as a taxi pulled to a stop beside Bastien 's van in the two lane driveway . " Wrong address ? " Bastien queried , knowing he was n't big on company . " It must be , " Lucern commented , then narrowed his eyes when the driver got out and opened the back door for a young woman to slip out . " Who is that ? " Bastien sounded even more surprised than Lucern felt . " I have n't a clue , " he muttered as the taxi driver retrieved a small suitcase and overnight bag from the trunk of the car . " I believe it 's your editor , " Marguerite announced . Both men swiveled to peer at their mother . They found her reading the now open express letter . " My editor ? What the hell are you talking about ? " Lucern marched back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rude behavior , Marguerite moved to Bastien 's side to peer curiously outside . " As the mail is so slow , and because the interest in your books is becoming so widespread , Ms. Kate C. Leever decided to come speak to you in person about these matters . Which , " his mother added archly , " you would know did you bother to read your mail . " " She 's quite pretty , is n't she ? " The comment , along with the speculation in his mother 's voice when she made it , were enough to raise alarm in Lucern . Marguerite sounded like a mother considering taking the matchmaking trail . " She 's contemplating matchmaking , Bastien . Take her home . Now , " he ordered . His brother burst out laughing , moving Lucern to point out , " After she has finished with me , she will focus on finding you a wife . " Bastien stopped laughing at once and grabbed his mother 's arm . " Come along , mother . This is none of our business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Marguerite shrugged her elbow free . " You are my sons . Your happiness and future are very much my business . " " Perhaps , but I do n't understand why this is an issue now . We are both well over four hundred years old . Why , after all this time , have you taken it into your head to see us married off ? " Marguerite pondered that for a moment before saying , " Well , ever since your father died , I 've been thinking- " " Dear God , " Lucern interrupted , drawing his mother 's curious gaze . " What did I say ? " " That is exactly how Lissianna ended up working at the shelter and getting involved with Greg . Dad died and she started thinking . " Bastien nodded solemnly . " Women should n't think . " " Bastien ! " Marguerite Argeneau exclaimed . " Now , you know I 'm teasing , mother , " he soothed , taking her arm again and-this time-getting her out the door . " I , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk down the steps of the porch to the sidewalk . His mother berated Bastien the whole way , and Lucern grinned at his brother 's beleaguered expression . He would catch hell all the way home , Lucern knew and almost felt sorry for him . Almost . His laughter died , however , as his gaze switched to the blonde who was apparently his editor . His mother paused in her berating to greet the woman . Lucern almost tried to hear what she was saying , but decided not to bother . He doubted he wanted to hear it anyway . He watched the woman nod and smile at his mother , then she took her luggage in hand and started up the sidewalk . Lucern 's eyes narrowed on the luggage . Dear God , she did n't expect to stay here with him , did she ? There was no mention in her letter of where she planned to stay . He decided she must expect to stay in a hotel . She would hardly just assume that he 'd put her up . The woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reassured himself , his gaze traveling over her person now . Kate C. Leever was about his mother 's height , which made her relatively tall for a woman , perhaps 5 ' 10 . She was also slim and shapely with long blond hair . She appeared pretty from the distance presently separating them . In a pale ice-blue business suit , Kate C. Leever resembled a cool glass of ice water to him . A pleasing image on this unseasonably warm September evening . The cool image was shattered when the woman dragged her luggage up the porch steps , paused before him , offered him a bright cheerful smile that lifted her lips and sparkled in her eyes , then blurted , " Hi . I 'm Kate Leever . I hope you got my letter . The mail was so slow and you kept forgetting to send me your phone number , so I thought I 'd come visit personally and talk to you about all the publicity possibilities that are opening up for us . I know you 're not really interested in partaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefits-you 'll reconsider . " Lucern stared at her wide , smiling lips for one mesmerized moment , then gave himself a shake and considered her long , obviously practiced speech . Reconsider ? Was that what she wanted ? Well , that was easy enough . He reconsidered . It was a quick task . " No . " He closed his door . * * * Kate stared at the solid wooden panel where Lucern Argeneau 's face used to be and could have shrieked with fury . The man was the most difficult , annoying , rude , obnoxious-She pounded at the door-Pigheaded , ignorant-The door whipped open and Kate quickly pasted a blatantly false , but wide-she should get marks for effort-smile on her mouth . The smile nearly slipped off her face in surprise when she got a look at him . The man was a lot younger than she 'd expected . Kate knew he 'd written for Edwin for a good ten years before she took over working with him . Yet he did n't look to be more than thirty-two or - three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early twenties . Aside from that , however , he was also shockingly handsome . His hair was as dark as night , his eyes a silver blue that almost seemed to reflect the porch light , his features were sharp and strong . He was tall and surprisingly muscular for a man with such a sedentary career . His shoulders spoke more of a laborer than an intellectual . Kate could n't help but be impressed by his good looks . Even the scowl on his face did n't detract from it . Without any effort on her part , the forced smile on her face took on some natural warmth as she said , " It 's me again . I have n't eaten yet , and I thought perhaps you 'd join me for a meal-on the company-and we could discuss- " " No . Please remove yourself from my doorstep . " Lucern Argeneau closed the door once more . " Well that was more than just a no , " she muttered to herself . " It was even a whole sentence really . " Ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and raised her hand to pound at the door again . Her smile was somewhat battered , but still in place when the door opened this time . This time , he did n't speak but merely arched an eyebrow in question . Trying to make her smile a little sunnier , she cleared her throat and said , " If you do n't like eating out , perhaps I could order something in and- " " No . " He started to close the door again , but Kate had n't lived in New York for five years without learning a trick or two . She quickly stuck her foot forward , managing not to wince as the door banged it before bouncing back open . Before Mr Argeneau could comment on her gorilla tactics , she said , " If you do n't care for take-out , perhaps I could pick up some groceries and cook you something you like . " Then , for good measure , she added , " That way we could discuss your fears and I might be able to alleviate them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not afraid . " " I see . " Kate allowed a healthy dose of doubt to creep into her voice , more than willing to stoop to manipulation if necessary . Then she waited , foot still in place , hoping that her desperation was n't showing , but knowing her calm facade was beginning to slip as the man pursed his lips and took his time considering her . His expression made her suspect he was measuring her for a coffin , as if he might be considering killing her and planting her in his garden to get her out of his hair . Kate tried not to think about that possibility too hard . Despite having worked with him for years as Edwin 's assistant and now for almost a year as his editor , Kate did n't know the man very well . In her less charitable moments , she had considered just what kind of man he might be . Most of her romance authors were female . In fact , every other author under her care was female . Lucern Argeneau , who wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of man wrote romances ? And vampire romances at that ? She had decided it was probably someone gay ... or someone weird . His expression at that moment was making her lean toward weird . Serial-killer type weird . " You have no intention of removing yourself , do you ? " he asked at last . Kate considered the question . A firm " no " would probably get her in the door . But did she want in the door ? Would the man slaughter her ? Would she be a headline in the next day 's news if she did get in the door ? Cutting off such unproductive and even frightening thoughts right there , Kate straightened her shoulders and announced firmly , " Mr Argeneau , I flew up here from New York . This is important to me . I 'm determined to talk you . I 'm your editor . " She emphasized the last word in case he had missed the relevance of that fact . It usually had a certain influence with writers , though he had shown no signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what else to say after that , so simply stood waiting for a response that never really came . Heaving a deep sigh , the man merely turned away and started up the dark hall . Kate stared uncertainly at his retreating back . He had n't slammed the door in her face this time . That was a good sign , was n't it ? Was it an invitation to enter ? Deciding she was going to take it as one , Kate hefted her small suitcase and overnight bag and stepped inside . It was a late summer evening , cooler than it had been earlier in the day , but still it was hot outside . In comparison , stepping into the house was much like stepping into a refrigerator . Kate automatically closed the door behind her to keep the cool air from escaping , then paused to allow her eyes to adjust to the dark interior . Setting her bags down by the door , she started carefully forward , heading for a square of light that suddenly seemed so far away . Lucern paused in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illumination of the night light . He was n't quite sure what to do . He never had guests . What did one do with them , exactly ? After an inner debate , he moved to the stove , grabbed the tea kettle that sat on the burner and took it to the sink to fill with water . After setting it on the stove and cranking the dial on high , he found the teapot , some tea bags and a full sugar bowl too . He set all of it haphazardly on a tray . He would offer Kate C. Leever a cup of tea . Once that was done , so was she , Lucern decided as hunger drew him to the refrigerator . Light spilled out into the room as he opened the door , making him blink after the previous darkness . Once his eyes had adjusted , he bent to pick up one of the two lonely bags of blood on the middle shelf of the large refrigerator . Other than the two blood bags , there was n't a single solitary item in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking . His refrigerator had pretty much been empty since his last housekeeper died . Hungry , Lucern did n't bother with a glass , but-still bent into the fridge-lifted the bag to his mouth and stabbed his fangs into it . The cool elixir of life immediately began to pour into his system , taking some of the edge off his crankiness . Lucern was never so cranky as when his blood levels were low . " Mr Argeneau ? " He jerked in surprise at that query from the doorway . The action ripped the bag Lucern held , sending the crimson fluid shooting out over him . It squirted in a cold shower over his face and into his hair as he instinctively straightened , banging his head on the underside of the closed freezer compartment . Cursing , he dropped the ruined bag onto the refrigerator shelf and grabbed for his head with one hand , slamming the refrigerator door closed with the other as Kate Leever rushed to his side . " Oh , my goodness ! Oh ! I 'm so sorry ! Oh ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coating his face and hair . " Oh God ! You 've cut your head . Bad ! " Lucern had n't seen an expression of such horror on anyone 's face since the good old days when lunch meant biting into a nice warm neck rather than a nasty cold bag . Seeming to recover her senses somewhat , the editor grabbed his arm and urged him toward the kitchen table . " Here , you 'd better sit down . You 're bleeding badly . " " I am fine , " Lucern muttered as she settled him in a chair . He found her concern rather annoying . If she was too nice to him , he might feel guilted into being nice back . " Where 's your phone ? " She was turning on one heel , scanning the kitchen for the item in question . " Why do you wish for a phone ? " He asked hopefully . Perhaps she would leave him alone now , he thought briefly , but her answer nixed that possibility . " To call an ambulance . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she looked at him again and Lucern found himself glancing down at his front . There was quite a bit of blood on his shirt , and he could feel it dripping down his face in rivulets . He could also smell it sharp and rich with tinny overtones . Without thinking , he slid his tongue out to lick his lips . Then what she 'd said slipped into his mind and he straightened abruptly . While it was convenient that she thought the blood was from an injury , there was no way he was going to a hospital . ( Continues ... ) by Lynsay Sands
