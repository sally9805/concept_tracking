Prologue I was falling through an indigo sky . I remember the wind whistling in my ears and my coat flapping about my knees as I plummeted . My head hurt , and as I gazed up into the remote , star-studded vault of the heavens , I was having a little trouble piecing together exactly how I had gotten there . I felt as if I 'd suddenly fallen off the edge of the earth and would hurtle forever , but the logical portion of my mind told me that all this falling must ultimately end . Unless Parliament had suddenly repealed Newton 's law of gravity , I was eventually going to strike something , and it was n't going to be pleasant . Raising my head just a little , I saw the large edifice of a bridge passing swiftly by , black against the cobalt night . Vaguely , I remembered thoughts I 'd had once of jumping from a bridge and shuffling off this mortal coil , but that had been a few months ago . Had I finally done it ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had the nerve . If this was an attempt , I could congratulate myself that it was successful , which was a novelty , since I 'd rarely been successful at anything in my twenty-two years . If that actually was a bridge above me , then presumably I would strike water shortly , which was far preferable to pavement , being less messy . I had another thought , or the beginning of one , but then I struck the water , and it was gone forever . Water is something I 've always considered soft , yielding , and changeable . One drinks it , pours it into vessels ; it soaks into the ground . This water was about as yielding as cement . I struck the water with a loud slap , limbs splayed , flat upon my back . It actually might have killed mewere it not for the coat that my employer , Cyrus Barker , had given me and insisted I wear . It was of Barker 's own design , with built-in pistol holders and a lead lining , near impervious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was also very heavy , unfortunately , which explains why I did not dawdle on the surface of the Thames but continued my descent . The Thames is not the most pristine of rivers , despite the paintings one sees in Grosvenor Gallery of idyllic country scenes , men punting along the river , poles in hand , while their best girls lie in the stern in immaculate white dresses , shaded from the sun by parasols . It 's not like that at all . I would think twice about offering a glass of it to even the most hateful of aunts , even if I were her sole legatee . It was certainly not a place to go swimming in July . But then , the choice had rather been taken out of my hands . Eventually , I came to rest on the bed of silt at the bottom , among the rubbish and detritus of London civilization . I lay for a moment , blinking up into the total blackness . Perhaps I should just give up , I thought . It would certainly be easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrender life without a fight . I had to get out of that coat , but it clung to me like a paramour . I struggled and flailed until reluctantly it started to give me up . I was tugging desperately on the second sleeve when I realized I was clutching something that was too big to get through it . It was my pistol . I 'd forgotten that I 'd been holding it before the fall . No matter . I let it go and pulled my limb through , finally free of the coat . All I had to do was to swim to the surface and to breathe sweet air again . But in which direction was it ? I was in stygian darkness , and my convulsions had even lost me the bottom I had just rested upon . I began to panic , and some of my precious air escaped . I reached frantically after the bubbles : they went down or , rather , up . I was on my head . I turned and swam after them . I had no idea how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air I 'd let escape needed to be replenished . I thrashed upward as my lungs began to insist , to scream for air . I became convinced I was n't going to make it . In two seconds , I was about to breathe in that fatal gulp of water . Thomas Llewelyn was going to fulfill his destiny and become another anonymous floater on the river . Give up , my limbs cried , going slack . It 's dozens of feet to the surface . You 'll never make it . Just then , my mind seemed to split in two . One part began to make peace with its Maker , preparing to be ushered into His presence  --  The Lord is my shepherd ; I shall not want  --  while the other , less pious , more skeptical side wanted to unravel one last puzzle before going into the beyond . I needed to disregard the pain of my splitting head and aching body and try to remember the events that had brought me here . In effect , before I died , I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sublime sound , seeming to come from everywhere and nowhere at once . It was n't loud  --  not much more than a thunderclap , really  --  but it was profound . I felt it echo from the outbuildings in our garden before reaching my ears . My employer , London enquiry agent Cyrus Barker , looked at me through his opaque spectacles , as if to ask What the deuce has happened now ? Barker and I had been in the garden behind his house , performing what he called " internal exercises . " It had been two and a half months since he 'd hired me as his assistant , and I was still recovering from the effects of our first case in which I 'd been injured severely , not to mention nearly killed . It was in the back of his mind , I believe , to take advantage of my convalescence and turn me into a wiry bantamweight through the physical training he taught at Scotland Yard . He had me at the dumbbells and Indian clubs constantly . I did n't object , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , second , I felt the training was to my benefit . The internal exercises were another matter . There we were in our shirtsleeves , moving placidly across the lawn , waving our arms in slow , precise movements resembling postures of self-defense , save that one would have been struck long before completing any of the motions . Barker , who had learned the art while growing up in China , took it all very seriously , but to me , the exercises were no more useful than playing hopscotch . I did them all the same , of course . Aside from paying my salary , he also provided room and board . The sky had been clear that day , and we had been treated to a shimmering sunset , blood red at first , as if a volcano were spewing forth west of us , then giving way to salmon and violet and finally deepest blue . The ornate garden behind Barker 's house in Newington was a pleasant place to be on a warm evening in late May . When I had first seen it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its large rocks , pebbles , and dwarf evergreens . Now the garden had erupted in a riot of color , resembling one of Mr. Whistler 's mad canvases , and Barker and his crew of Chinese gardeners were hard-pressed , clipping and pruning , to return it to its more stoic appearance . Harm , self-appointed guardian of the property , reigned over his domain from a flat rock in the stone garden . Barker had informed me he was one of less than a dozen Chinese temple dogs , or Pekingese , in Europe . The dowager empress of China had given the dog to him " for services rendered , " but what those services were , he had not revealed . The Guv'nor could be exasperatingly reticent when it suited him . Our motions might have interested the little dog had he not seen us do them a thousand times . From where I stood in the bed of thyme , slowly waving my arms about like an inmate from Bethlehem Asylum just down the street , I could hear the dog snoring on the rock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help my concentration that we faced the back of the house . On the other side of the door , there was a well-appointed kitchen with a pantry , which at that moment contained an apple pie with cognac and caramelized sugar , prepared by one of London 's premier chefs , Etienne Dummolard . Etienne came in most mornings from his Soho restaurant , Le Toison d'Or , with enough freshly prepared food to last us through the day , like so much manna from heaven . After the pie , I promised myself , I would sit down with a book in the library . Barker was an inveterate book collector , and being a Scot , he had a complete set of the Waverly novels . I had been working my way through them and was now up to The Heart of Midlothian . " One more time , lad , and we 're through for the night , " Barker said . I sighed and raised my protesting arms again . It was then that we heard the boom . We both knew instantly that something had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He began barking hysterically . It was his clarion cry , his alarm for us mortals too dull to appreciate that something significant had occurred . In answer , we heard dozens of responses from other canine sentinels across London . We needed no other warning . Barker and I sprinted across the lawn toward the back door . Once inside , we skidded across the polished floor and climbed the first staircase . Running past my room , we mounted the stairs to Barker 's aerie . My employer seized a small box I 'd never noticed before from one of the tables and tripped its latch . Inside was a brass telescope , a relic of his sailing days , I presumed . He flicked open the telescope and scanned the horizon to the west from one of the dormer windows . " Anything ? " I asked . " Anything ? " " Nothing appears to be on fire , but there is a haze on the far side of the river , " Barker responded . I took the telescope eagerly and looked myself but saw only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river where our offices stood . " What should we do ? " I asked . " I suppose we should go and see if anything is amiss . " The latter seemed as sensible a decision as any . I left him and went down to the first floor for my jacket . When I came downstairs a few minutes later , knotting my tie , Barker 's butler , Jacob Maccabee , was waiting in the hall with a look of concern on his face . " It could have been a factory accident , I suppose , " he said , straightening my knot . " Could you hear which direction it came from ? " " You know the garden , " I answered . " It 's like sitting in a soup bowl , with those high brick walls . The Guv looked toward the west . " I hoped Mac was right , and our going out would be for naught . A factory accident would be preferable to the other possibility , a bomb . Since the previous year , a radical group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamiting campaign against the city in an attempt to force a bill for Home Rule . Several bombs had been located safely by the authorities , and one had exploded harmlessly in the baggage room of Victoria Station , but the fact that the attempts had been unsuccessful was not a comfort to most Londoners . The Criminal Investigation Department at Scotland Yard hastily formed a new section , the Special Irish Branch , to safeguard the public and the Royal Family . Despite their efforts , neither Mac nor I was surprised at the thought that the I.R.B . might strike again . Finally , Barker came down the stairs . He was soberly dressed in a black cutaway coat , his maroon tie thrust up under a wing collar and held with a pearl stickpin . He stepped between us and reached for a stick from the hall stand before opening the door . I naturally followed . The pie and Midlothian would have to wait . Our hansom cab , which Barker had acquired during our last investigation two months before , was quartered just a half mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send me to rouse the stable boy , something I 'd prefer not to do after a full day 's work and those dratted exercises . As it turned out , that would have been preferable to what Barker had in mind . " Right , then , " he stated . " Let 's hop it , lad . " " Hop it , sir ? " " Aye . We 'll walk . You can use the exercise . " He did n't waste breath on conversation , but set off northwest along London Road , his stick swinging dangerously back and forth . At an inch or two over six feet in height , he was a head taller than I. Consequently , I had to double his footsteps in order to keep up . Most of the streets on the south side of London were empty , the shops locked and dark . The residents , enjoying their well-deserved evening of rest , seemed unconcerned by the noise that had brought us out on this quiet evening . A chorus of crickets chirped in the vestiges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ croak of the frogs that fed on them . If I closed my eyes , I could almost feel as if I were back in the country at my childhood home in Wales . Barker suddenly dodged off Waterloo Road , and had I not been trying to stay close , I would have shot past the lane he ducked into . For the next several minutes I felt as if I were in a maze , following my employer from street to passage to alleyway . Before I knew it , we 'd come up along some railroad sleepers , and then we were on a bridge . Not Waterloo , nor Westminster , but a smaller bridge between the two . " What bridge is this ? " I asked , peering over the side at the Thames , which looked as thin and black as India ink . " The Charing Cross Railway and Footbridge , " he called back , over his shoulder . " Where does it fetch up ? " " On the Embankment behind Scotland Yard . " " Wait , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's been a footbridge right by our offices all this time , and you did n't tell me ? " " If I told you everything , Llewelyn , how ever would you learn anything for yourself ? " I noticed an immediate difference on the west side of the river . There was a chalky grit in the air . The gaslights were balls of light on stalks , as if a globe of frosted glass had been fitted over each one . The haze grew thicker as we approached , and as I watched , wraithlike figures began to come forward out of the gloom . I 'd have taken them for ghosts , if I believed in such things , but as we passed among them , they seemed tangible enough ; normal citizens , covered in brick dust from head to toe , all staring with dazed expressions out of red-rimmed eyes . Barker and I reached for our pocket handkerchiefs and pushed ourselves through the foglike haze and the crowd of shocked and bedraggled residents . In Whitehall Place , we had to pick our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we crossed Whitehall Street and looked back that we could see the full devastation . " My word , " I murmured . It was the thirtieth of May 1884 , and someone had just blown up Scotland Yard .
