<p> Paris <p> Are there any good rock songs about revenge ? Any top-40 hits on the kind of motivation that can topple mountains ? If not , maybe Sheryl Crow has another No. 1 on her hands . All she has to do is tap into the adrenal gland of her boyfriend , Lance Armstrong , and examine a white-hot intensity the Tour de France never has seen before . <p> On the brink of history , Armstrong has the world 's eyes on him once again . <p> He 's at peace with his personal life and favored to win a sixth Tour de France , unprecedented in the 101 years of arguably the world 's most difficult sporting event . If that is n't motivation enough , the fingers pointing at him certainly are a week before the start of the 2,100-mile Tour . <p> " L.A. Confidential , the Secrets of Lance Armstrong " was released last week and prints accusations from Armstrong 's former assistant claiming Armstrong asked her once to dispose of used syringes and give him makeup to hide needle marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of London reporter David Walsh , admitted it 's " circumstantial evidence , " which did n't help the book 's credibility , or Armstrong 's anger . <p> " A group of lawyers in London were licking their chops when they read that , " Armstrong said from his training base in Girona , Spain . <p> He sounded confident , relaxed and strident before heading off for more training in the nearby Pyrenees . The U.S. Postal Service star discussed how he 's better prepared for this Tour than last year because of his more settled personal life with Crow , the pain of divorce and the pain he 'd like to inflict on the authors of " L.A. Confidential . " <p> This is n't new . Walsh , an anti-drug crusader , wrote a story three years ago linking Armstrong to Michele Ferrari , an Italian doctor who once compared EPO , cycling 's most popular performance-enhancing drug , with orange juice . That despite its rumored links to many of the eight cycling deaths in the past 18 months . Ferrari now stands trial in Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . Armstrong , a recovered testicular cancer victim who said he never has used drugs , is suing everyone in sight . Last week a French court dismissed a request by Armstrong to have his rebuttal printed in " L.A. Confidential . " <p> " Listen , these guys have no credibility within the cycling press , " Armstrong said . " Now , does it make fascinating reading ? If I sit at a TV and watch a show about aliens and UFOs , will I watch it ? Yeah . Will I believe it ? No . <p> " The problem is that journalism 's supposed to be fair and balanced . But if you call 400 people and three of them are at the point in their lives where they wo n't tell the truth , want to bring someone down by telling lies , OK . Put it in a book . But if the other 397 say he 's a good guy and deserves it all , they do n't put that in . " <p> Driven by history <p> Phil Liggett is the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 32nd race when it begins in Liege , Belgium , and he points out that Armstrong 's doubters seem to forget Armstrong is a recovered cancer patient . <p> " Years ago , before he won his first or second Tour , he looked at me and said , ' Look , Phil . I 've seen death and looked at it in the face and I 'm not going to my death bed , " ' Liggett said . " He knows his body better than anybody . I remember he once sat on the road after chemo . He could n't ride 5 miles . He sat on the road and cried . " <p> If the book never saw the light of day , Armstrong still had plenty of motivation . Besides being a cyclist , Armstrong is also a cycling buff . He knows he confirmed his place in sports history last year by becoming only the fifth man to win five Tours . <p> A sixth ? Start up with the comparisons to the Boston Celtics and the New York Yankees . <p> " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it different , " Armstrong said . " I ca n't lie and say I do n't think about that . I try not to think much about it . But I break down all five . They 're in the bag . They 're done . This is different . It 's the only one that matters . <p> " But I 'm not even thinking about the race . I think about racing , testing , staying absolutely healthy , having no problems from the start , no crashes , no illnesses , no nothing . " <p> That would put him a few Alps ahead of last year , when about the only thing that did n't go wrong was the anti-war French embraced him as few thought they would soon after the United States invaded Iraq . They love their heroes here , and despite everything going wrong , he still won , which says a little about the gap in the field . However , he defeated Germany 's Jan Ullrich by only 61 seconds , the closest finish since 1989 . <p> Armstrong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champagne a year ago when he said , " This will not happen again . " <p> Armstrong lost 90 seconds in the first time trial , a steaming hot 28 miles to Cap ' Decouverte in which he nearly keeled over from dehydration . That did n't only come from the heat . The previous month , Armstrong inexplicably went all out to win the Dauphine , an annual eight-day tune-up race . <p> Armstrong won , but he suffered a painful crash and arrived in Paris sore and depleted . <p> Throw in a gastrointestinal infection he picked up from his son , and Armstrong was lucky he got past the Seine River . <p> At this month 's Dauphine , Armstrong went into cruise control . Never has a fourth-place finish looked so promising . <p> " When you have a big crash you do n't sleep properly , you do n't eat properly , " Armstrong said . " It was a dirty crash , so you 're taking antibiotics . Last year 's preparation was n't bad . I was n't well , if that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big problem . I just feel a lot healthier this year , a lot stronger , a lot more stable , physically . I 'm still working on the mental part . " <p> Armstrong added a laugh , knowing the one-liners that disclaimer would produce . <p> Out of the spotlight <p> The cycling world has looked upon his relationship with Crow in two ways . Those who know him say he 'll be in a much more stable mood - the book notwithstanding . A year ago , he had just reconciled with his wife long enough to kiss on the winner 's podium . Shortly thereafter , they filed for divorce . <p> " He 's more relaxed than he was a year ago , " said John Wilcockson , editor of Boulder-based VeloNews , who will cover his 36th Tour . " If you 've ever been through a divorce , it 's not easy , especially if you have kids . Lance was confused last year , before and during the Tour . He 's got a steady girlfriend . She 's going to be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard the speculation before . During the 2003 Tour , no one asked where his wife was for three weeks before the Paris photo-op . But the whispers could be heard from Paris to the Pyrenees . Now , with his ex-wife and children in Austin , Texas , Armstrong set the record straight . <p> " I still have a great - not great but very good - relationship with my ex-wife , " he said . " Over the last 12 months , we 'd gotten to this place where the marriage was the problem with Lance and the problem with the Tour de France and I 'd hate her to be part of that . I 'm not saying it was n't stressful , but that was n't the reason I nearly lost the Tour . <p> " The point is now my personal life is perhaps more stable , but I miss my kids . When the Tour 's done I go coach them in soccer , which is n't a pretty sight . That 's what I look forward to . " <p> Foes wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translates into a Malibu mentality . They read during the winter about Armstrong spending more time in the U.S. with Crow , lounging on the beach , swimming in her pool and attending sporting events . Half the world thought a slothful Armstrong was sitting around eating doughnuts . That sprouted from an off-the-cuff interview at a Los Angeles Lakers game in which Crow , when asked if she 'd been on a bike , said , " Are you kidding me ? I 'm just looking for the next Krispy Kreme stand . " <p> The cycling world ran with it . Calling it " doughnutgate , " Armstrong ran with it , too , laughing all the way through his grueling daily rides above Crow 's Hollywood Hills home . <p> " Lance likes to stir that pot a little bit , " said his trainer , Chris Carmichael . " I think he is sort of like , ' OK , I 'm fat and out of shape and I 'm hanging out with a rock star . That 's right . ' I think that 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> In reality , he has a girlfriend who understands . If anyone knows the glare of a spotlight , it 's a rock star . <p> " She does n't consider herself a famous person or a celebrity , " Armstrong said . " She 's very down to earth , and I 'd like to think I 'm the same way . But it is nice to go walk into some place where it 's all about Sheryl Crow and I stand in the corner and be the guy with the cold beer in his hand and be a big zero . " <p> A bigger concern than doughnuts is tougher competition . Analysts say this Tour is probably a three-man race . Ullrich , the 1997 Tour winner , is Armstrong 's biggest worry . Unlike last year , Ullrich is n't recovering from knee problems and does n't plan on having the same stomach ailment that few knew nearly forced him out of the Tour . <p> He also has a new , stronger team . He is with Telekom-Mobile , boasting the top budget on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes in his pocket . However , he lost his best lieutenant when Alexandre Vinokourov , third in last year 's Tour , went down with a shoulder injury . The German press also claim Ullrich , 30 , has gotten fat . Wilcockson does n't believe it . <p> " I 've seen him quite a bit this year , " Wilcockson said . " He 's stronger mentally because he has a settled team . It 's the best team in the world in theory . And he 's hungry to win . He really wants to beat Lance . " <p> Long and winding road <p> Armstrong 's other big worry is Boulder 's Tyler Hamilton . He finished fourth last year despite suffering a broken collarbone in the first stage . The grit helped earn him a lucrative contract with Phonak , a Swiss team that recruited him as its star . <p> During the Dauphine time trials , the few times Armstrong tested himself , Hamilton , 33 , started two minutes behind him and finished only 30 seconds behind . <p> This year 's course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cooler weather , he has won all three mountain stages at La Mongie , Plateau de Beille and L'Alpe d'Huez . For the first time , L'Alpe d'Huez will be a time trial , a grueling time trial : 9.3 miles uphill with 21 switchbacks . <p> Armstrong could face trouble in the Pyrenees , where he must fend off attacks from many , including Roberto Heras , formerly U.S. Postal 's best climber who left for big coin as Liberty Seguros ' star . <p> " We do the Pyrenees first , and they 're going to shape the race much more than L'Alpe d'Huez , " Armstrong said . " They 're longer . L'Alpe d'Huez is a 35-minute day . It 's mystical . It 's famous . But it 's 35 minutes . The Pyrenees will be six-hour days with tough finishes , and I think the Spanish will be very aggressive . " <p> However , even if Armstrong is in trouble after L'Alpe d'Huez , he 'll be a favorite on the second-to-last day , a 33-mile time trial over the rolling hills of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 'll be more difficult , " Liggett said . " I think he 'll get it . " <p> Added Wilcockson : " If I had to put money on it , yeah , you 'd have to put money on him winning again . Because mentally , he 's the boss . " <p> And if he does ? Someone might even write a song about him .
