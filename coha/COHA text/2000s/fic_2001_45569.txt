James Morrow 's winning novels include Only Begotten Daughter , This Is the Way the World Ends , Towing Jehovah , and most recently , The Eternal Footman . He reports that he has finished a draft of his next novel , The Last Witchfinder , and jokes that he will continue rewriting it until he runs out of food . Some of his short fiction has been assembled in Swatting at the Cosmos and Bible Stories for Adults , but as yet , the majority of his short fiction remains uncollected . Here he adds to that oeuvre with a witty work of science fiction in the tradition of H. G. Wells . ( Amazing , is n't it , how pertinent Wells 's science fiction remains after a full century ? ) " The Cat 's Pajamas " was published first in Embrace the Mutation , a new anthology of stories that accompany the artwork of phantasmagoric photomontagist J. K. Potter . <p> " All politics is local politics . " - Tip O'Neill THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY Enlightenment was still in our faces , fetishizing the rational intellect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said to Vickie , " Screw it . This is n't for us . Let 's hop in the car and drive to romanticism , or maybe even preindustrial paganism , or possibly all the way to hunter-gatherer utopianism . " But we only got as far as Pennsylvania . I knew that the idea of spending all summer on the road would appeal to Vickie . Most of her affections , including her unbridled wanderlust , are familiar to me . Not only had we lived together for six years , we also worked at the same New Jersey high school - Vickie teaching American history , me offering a souped-up eleventh-grade Humanities course with the result that both our screaming matches and our flashes of rapport drew upon a fund of shared experiences . And so it was that the first day of summer vacation found us rattling down Route 80 in our decrepit VW bus , listening to Crash Test Dummies CDs and pretending that our impulsive westward flight somehow partook of political subversion , though we sensed it was really just an extended camping trip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vickie had spent the previous two years promoting the idea of holy matrimony , an institution that has consistently failed to enchant me . Nevertheless , when we reached the Delaware Water Gap , I turned to her and said , " Here 's a challenge for us . Let 's see if we ca n't become man and wife by this time tomorrow afternoon . " It 's important , I feel , to suffuse a relationship with a certain level of unpredictability , if not outright caprice . " Vows , rings , music , all of it . " " You 're crazy , " she said , brightening . She 's got a killer smile , sharp at the edges , luminous at the center . " It takes a week just to get the blood  --  test results . " " I was reading in Newsweek that there 's a portable analyzer on the market . If we can find a technologically advanced justice of the peace , we 'll meet the deadline with time to spare . " " Deadline ? " She tightened her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is n't a game . We 're talking about a marriage . " " It 's a game and a gamble - I know from experience . But with you , sweetheart , I 'm ready to bet the farm . " She laughed and said , " I love you . " We spent the night in a motel outside a pastoral Pennsylvania borough called Greenbriar , got up at ten , made distracted love , and began scanning the yellow pages for a properly outfitted magistrate . By noon we had our man , District Justice George Stratus , proud owner of a brand new Sorrel-130 blood analyzer . It so happened that Judge Stratus was something of a specialist in instant marriage . For a hundred dollars flat , he informed me over the phone , we could have " the nanosecond nuptial package , " including blood test , license , certificate , and a bottle of Taylor 's champagne . I told him it sounded like a bargain . To get there , we had to drive down a sinuous band of dirt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , apple orchards , and cow pastures of Pollifex Farm . We arrived in a billowing nimbus of dust . Judge Stratus turned out to be a fat and affable paragon of efficiency . He immediately set about pricking our fingers and feeding the blood to his Sorrel-130 , which took only sixty seconds to endorse our DNA even as it acquitted us of venereal misadventures . He faxed the results to the county courthouse , signed the marriage certificate , and poured us each a glass of champagne . By three o'clock , Vickie and I were legally entitled to partake of connubial bliss . I think Judge Stratus noticed my pained expression when I handed over the hundred dollars , because he suggested that if we were short on cash , we should stop by the farm and talk to Andre Pollifex . " He 's always looking for asparagus pickers this time of year . " In point of fact , my divorce from Irene had cost me plenty , making a shambles of both my bank account and my credit record , and Vickie 's fondness for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on , had depleted her resources as well . We had funds enough for the moment , though , so I told Stratus we probably would n't be joining the migrant worker pool before August . " Well , sweetheart , we 've done it , " I said as we climbed back into the bus . " Mr. and Mrs. Blake Meeshaw . " " The price was certainly right , " said Vickie , " even though the husband involved is a fixer-upper . " " You 've got quite a few loose shingles yourself , " I said . " I 'll be hammering and plastering all summer . " Although we had no plans to stop at Pollifex Farm , when we got there an enormous flock of sheep was crossing the road . Vickie hit the brakes just in time to avoid making mutton of a stray lamb , and we resigned ourselves to watching the woolly parade , which promised to be as dull as a passing freight train . Eventually a swarthy man appeared gripping a silver-tipped shepherd 's crook . He advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Purgatory balancing a millstone on his neck . A full minute elapsed before Vickie and I realized that the sheep were moving in a loop , like wooden horses on a carousel . With an impatience bordering on hysteria , I leaped from the van and strode toward the obnoxious herdsman . What possible explanation could he offer for erecting this perpetual barricade ? Nearing the flock , I realized that the scene 's strangest aspect was neither the grotesque shepherd nor the tautological roadblock , but the sheep themselves . Every third or fourth animal was a mutant , its head distinctly humanoid , though the facial features seemed melted together , as if they 'd been cast in wax and abandoned to the summer sun . The sooner we were out of here , I decided , the better . " What the hell do you think you 're doing ? " I shouted . " Get these animals off the road ! " The shepherd hobbled up to me and pulled a tranquilizer pistol from his belt with a manifest intention of rendering me unconscious . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun went off , the dart found my chest , and the world turned black . REGAINING consciousness , I discovered than someone - the violent shepherd ? Andre Pollifex ? - had relocated my assaulted self to a small bright room perhaps twelve feet square . Dust motes rode the sunlit air . Sections of yellow wallpaper buckled outward from the sheetrock like spritsails puffed with wind . I lay on a mildewed mattress , elevated by a box-spring framed in steel . A turban of bandages encircled my head . Beside me stood a second bed , as uninviting as my own , its bare mattress littered with artifacts that I soon recognized as Vickie 's - comb , hand mirror , travel alarm , ankh earrings , well-thumbed paperback of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance . It took me at least five minutes , perhaps as many as ten , before I realized that my brain had been removed from my cranium and that the pink , throbbing , convoluted mass of tissue on the nearby customized library cart was in fact my own thinking apparatus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not deny its actuality . Every time I tapped my skull , a hollow sound came forth , as if I were knocking on an empty casserole dish . Fortunately , the physicians responsible for my condition had worked hard to guarantee that it would entail no functional deficits . Not only was my brain protected by a large plexiglass jar filled with a clear , acrid fluid , it also retained its normal connection to my heart and spinal cord . A ropy mass of neurons , interlaced with augmentations of my jugular vein and my two carotid arteries , extended from beneath my orphaned medulla and stretched across four feet of empty space before disappearing into my reopened fontanel , the whole arrangement shielded from microbial contamination by a flexible plastic tube . Iwas thankful formy surgeons " conscientiousness , but also-I do n't mind telling you - extremely frightened and upset . My brain 's extramural location naturally complicated the procedure , but in a matter of minutes I managed to transport both myself and the library cart into the next room , an unappointed parlor bedecked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the while calling Vickie 's name . She did n't answer . I opened the door and shuffled into the putrid air of Pollifex Farm . Everywhere I turned , disorder prospered . The cottage in which I 'd awoken seemed ready to collapse under its own weight . The adjacent windmill canted more radically than Pisa 's Leaning Tower . Scabs of leprous white paint mottled the sides of the main farmhouse . No building was without its unhinged door , its shattered window , its sunken roof , its disintegrating wall - a hundred instances of entropy mirroring the biological derangement that lay within . I did not linger in the stables , home to six human-headed horses . Until this moment , I had thought the centaurial form intrinsically beautiful , but with their bony backs and twisted faces these monsters soon deprived me of that supposition . Nor did I remain long in the chicken coop , habitat of four gigantic human-headed hens , each the size of a German shepherd . Nor did the pig shed detain me , for seven human-headed hogs is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried toward an immense barn , lured by a spirited performance of Tschaikovsky 's Piano Concerto No. 1 wafting through a crooked doorway right out of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari . Cautiously I entered . Spacious and high-roofed , the barn was a kind of agrarian cathedral , the Chartres of animal husbandry . In the far corner , hunched over a baby grand piano , sat a humanoid bull : blunt nose , gaping nostrils , a long tapering horn protecting from either side of his head . Whereas his hind legs were of the bovine variety , his forelegs ended in a pair of human hands that skated gracefully along the keyboard . He shared his bench with my wife , and even at this distance I could see that the bull man 's virtuosity had brought her to the brink of rapture . Cerebrum in tow , I made my way across the bam . With each step , my apprehension deepened , my confusion increased , and my anger toward Vickie intensified . Apprehension , confusion , anger : while I was not yet accustomed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the phenomenon now seemed less peculiar than when I 'd first returned to sentience . " I know what you 're thinking , " said Vickie , acknowledging my presence . " Why am I sitting here when I should be helping you recover from the operation ? Please believe me : Karl said the anesthesia would n't wear off for another four hours . " She proceeded to explain that Karl was the shepherd who 'd tranquilized me on the road , subsequently convincing her to follow him onto the farm rather than suffer the identical fate . But Karl 's name was the least of what Vickie had learned during the past forty-eight hours . Our present difficulties , she elaborated , traced to the VD screening we 'd received on Wednesday . In exchange for a substantial payment , judge Stratus had promised to alert his patrons at Pollifex Farm the instant he happened upon a blood sample bearing the deoxyribonucleic acid component known as QZ-11-4 . Once in possession of this gene - or , more specifically , once in possession of a human brain whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Pollifex 's biological investigations could go forward . " Oh , Blake , they 're doing absolutely wonderful work here . " Vickie rose from the bench , came toward me , and , taking care not to become entangled in my spinal cord , gave me a mildly concupiscent hug . " An external brain to go with your external genitalia - very sexy . " " Stop talking nonsense , Vickie ! " I said . " I 've been mutilated ! " She stroked my bandaged forehead and said , " Once you hear the whole story , you 'll realize that your bilateral hemispherectomy serves a greater good . " " Call me Maxwell , " said the bull man , lifting his fingers from the keyboard . " Maxwell Taurus . " His voice reminded me of Charles Laughton 's . " I must congratulate you on your choice of marriage partner , Blake . Vickie has a refreshingly open mind . " " And I have a depressingly vacant skull , " I replied . " Take me to this lunatic Pollifex so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The doctor would never agree to that . " Maxwell fixed me with his stare , his eyes all wet and brown like newly created caramel apples . " He requires round-the-clock access to your anterior cortex . " A flock of human-headed geese fluttered into the barn , raced toward a battered aluminum trough full of grain , and began to eat . Unlike Maxwell , the geese did not possess the power of speech - either that , or they simply had nothing to say to each other . I sighed and leaned against my library cart . " So what , exactly , does QZ-11-4 do ? " " Dr. Pollifex calls it the integrity gene , wellspring of decency , empathy , and compassionate foresight , " said Maxwell . " Francis of Assisi had it . So did Charles Darwin , Clara Barton , Mahatma Gandhi , Florence Nightingale , Albert Schweitzer , and Susan B. Anthony . And now - now that Dr. Pollifex has started injecting me with a serum derived from your hypertrophic superego - now I 've got it too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maxwell 's words , I realized that I 'd lost the thread of his logic . " At the risk of sounding disingenuously modest , I 'd have to say I 'm not a particularly ethical individual . " " Even if a person inherits QZ-11-4 , it does n't necessarily enjoy expression . And even if the gene enjoys expression - " Maxwell offered me a semantically freighted stare - " the beneficiary does n't always learn to use his talent . Indeed , among Dr. Pollifex 's earliest discoveries was the fact that complete QZ-11-4 actualization is impossible in a purely human species . The serum - we call it Altruoid - the serum reliably engenders ethical superiority only in people who 've been genetically melded with domesticated birds and mammals . " " You mean - you used to be ... human ? " " For twenty years I sold life insurance under the name Lewis Phelps . Have no fear , Blake . We are not harvesting your cerebrum in vain . I shall employ my Altruoid allotment to bestow great boons on Greenbriar . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the bull man , " but as far as I 'm concerned , you 're a terrorist and a brain thief , and I intend to bring this matter to the police . " " You will find that strategy difficult to implement . " Maxwell left his piano and , walking upright on his hooves , approached my library cart . " Pollifex Farm is enclosed by a barbed-wire fence twelve feet high . I suggest you try making the best of your situation . " The thought of punching Maxwell in the face now occurred to me , but I dared not risk uprooting my arteries and spinal cord . " If Pollifex continues pilfering my cortex , how long before I become a basket case ? " " Never . The doctor happens to be the world 's greatest neurocartographer . He 'll bring exquisite taste and sensitivity to each extraction . During the next three years , you 'll lose only trivial knowledge , useless skills , and unpleasant memories . " " Three years ? " I howled . " You bastards plan to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month . Once that interval has passed , my peers and I shall have reached the absolute apex of vertebrate ethical development . " " See , Blake , they 've thought of everything , " said Vickie . " These people are visionaries . " " These people are Nazis , " I said . " Really , sir , name calling is unnecessary , " said Maxwell with a snort . " There 's no reason we ca n't all be friends . " He rested an affirming hand on my shoulder . " We 've given you a great deal of information to absorb . I suggest you spend tomorrow afternoon in quiet contemplation . Come evening , we 'll all be joining the doctor for dinner . It 's a meal you 're certain to remember . " MY NEW BRIDE and I passed the night in our depressing little cottage beside the windmill . Much to my relief , I discovered that my sexual functioning had survived the bilateral hemispherectomy . We had to exercise caution , of course , lest we snap the vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole encounter quickly devolved into a kind of slow-motion ballet . Vickie said it was like mating with a china figurine , the first negative remark I 'd heard her make concerning my predicament . At ten o'clock the next morning , one of Karl 's human-headed sheep entered the bedroom , walking upright and carrying a wicker tray on which rested two covered dishes . When I asked the sheep how long she 'd been living at Pollifex Farm , her expression became as vacant as a cake of soap . I concluded that the power of articulation was reserved only to those mutants on an Altruoid regimen . The sheep bowed graciously and left , and we set about devouring our scrambled eggs , hot coffee , and buttered toast . Upon consuming her final mouthful , Vickie announced that she would spend the day reading two scientific treatises she 'd received from Maxwell , both by Dr. Pollifex : On the Mutability of Species and The Descent of Morals . I told her I had a different agenda . If there was a way out of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it . Before I could take leave of my wife , Karl himself appeared , clutching a black leather satchel to his chest as a mother might hold a baby . He told me he deeply regretted Wednesday 's assault - I must admit , I detected no guile in his apology - then explained that he 'd come to collect the day 's specimen . From the satchel he removed a glass-and-steel syringe , using it to suck up a small quantity of anterior cortex and transfer it to a test tube . When I told Karl that I felt nothing during the procedure , he reminded me that the human brain is an insensate organ , nerveless as a stone . I commenced my explorations . Pollifex 's domain was vaster than I 'd imagined , though most of its fields and pastures were deserted . True to the bull man 's claim , a fence hemmed the entire farm , the barbed-wire strands woven into a kind of demonic tennis net and strung between steel posts rising from a concrete foundation . In the northeast corner lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was here , clearly , that Andre Pollifex perpetrated his various crimes against nature . The doors were barred , the windows occluded , but by staring through the cracks in the walls I managed to catch glimpses of hospital gurneys , surgical lights , and three enormous glass beakers in which sallow , teratoid fetuses drifted like pickles in brine . About twenty paces from Pollifex 's laboratory , a crumbling tool shed sat atop a hill of naked dirt . I gave the door a hard shove - not too hard , given my neurological vulnerability - and it pivoted open on protesting hinges . A shaft of afternoon sunlight struck the interior , revealing an assortment of rakes , shovels , and pitchforks , plus a dozen bags of fertilizer - but , alas , no wire cutters . My perambulations proved exhausting , both mentally and physi  --  tally , and I returned to the cottage for a much-needed nap . That afternoon , my brain tormented me with the notorious " student 's dream . " I 'd enrolled in an advanced biology course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't attended a single class or handed in even one assignment . And now I was expected to take the final exam . Vickie , my brain , and I were the last to arrive at Andre Pollifex 's dinner party , which occurred in an airy glass-roofed conservatory attached to the back of the farmhouse . The room smelled only slightly better than the piano barn . At the head of the table presided our host , a disarmingly ordinary-looking man , weak of jaw , slight of build , distinguished primarily by his small black mustache and complementary goatee . His face was pale and flaccid , as if he 'd been raised in a cave . The instant he opened his mouth to greet us , though , I apprehended something of his glamour , for he had the most majestic voice I 've ever heard outside of New York 's Metropolitan Opera House . " Welcome , Mr. and Mrs. Meeshaw , " he said . " May I call you Blake and Vickie ? " " Of course , " said Vickie . " May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pollifex 's white countenance contracted into a scowl . " I can appreciate your distress , Blake . Your sacrifice has been great . I believe I speak for everyone here when I say that our gratitude knows no bounds . " Karl directed us into adjacent seats , then resumed his place next to Pollifex , directly across from the bull man . I found myself facing a pig woman whose large ears flopped about like college pennants and whose snout suggested an oversized button . Vickie sat opposite a goat man with a tapering white beard dangling from his chin and two corrugated horns sprouting from his brow . " I 'm Serge Milkovich , " said the goat man , shaking first Vickie 's hand , then mine . " In my former life I was Bud Frye , plumbing contractor . " " Call me Juliana Sowers , " said the pig woman , enacting the same ritual . " At one time I was Doris Owens of Owens Real Estate , but then I found a higher calling . I can not begin to thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and local politics . " " Local politics ? " I said . " We three beneficiaries of QZ-11-4 form the core of the new Common Sense Party , " said Juliana . " We intend to transform Greenbriar into the most livable community in America . " " I 'm running for Borough Council , " said Serge . " Should my campaign prove successful , I shall fight to keep our town free of Consumerland discount stores . Their advent is inevitably disastrous for local merchants . " Juliana crammed a handful of hors d'oeuvres into her mouth . " I seek a position on the School Board . My stances wo n't prove automatically popular - better pay for elementary teachers , sex education starting in grade four - but I 'm prepared to support them with passion and statistics . " Vickie grabbed my hand and said , " See what I mean , Blake ? They may be mutants , but they have terrific ideas . " " As for me , I 've got my eye on the Planning Commission , " said Maxwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know there 's a scheme afoot to run the Route 80 Extension along our northern boundary , just so it 'll be easier for people to get to Penn State football games ? Once construction begins , the environmental desecration will be profound . " As Maxwell expounded upon his anti-extension arguments , a halfdozen sheep arrived with our food . In deference to Maxwell and Juliana , the cuisine was vegetarian : tofu , lentils , capellini with meatless marinara sauce . It was all quite tasty , but the highlight of the meal was surely the venerable and exquisite vintages from Pollifex 's cellar . After my first few swallows of Brunello di Montalcino , I worried that Pollifex 's scalpel had denied me the pleasures of intoxication , but eventually the expected sensation arrived . ( I attributed the hiatus to the extra distance my blood had to travel along my extended arteries . ) By the time the sheep were serving dessert , I was quite tipsy , though my bursts of euphoria alternated uncontrollably with spasms of anxiety . " Know what I think ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent my brain from slurring my words . " I think you 're trying to turn me into a zombie . " The doctor proffered a heartening smile . " Your discomfort is understandable , Blake , but I can assure you all my interventions have been innocuous thus far - and will be in the future . Tell me , what two classroom pets did your second-grade teacher , Mrs. Hines , keep beside her desk , and what were their names ? " " I have no idea . " " Of course you do n't . That useless memory vanished with the first extraction . A hamster and a chameleon . Florence and Charlie . Now tell me about the time you threw up on your date for the senior prom . " " That never happened . " " Yes it did , but I have spared you any recollection of the event . Nor will you ever again be haunted by the memory of forgetting your lines during the Cransford Community Theater production of A Moon for the Misbegotten . Now please recite Joyce Kilmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , you 've made your point , " I said . " But you still have no right to mess with my head . " I swallowed more wine . " As for this ridiculous Common Sense Party - okay , sure , these candidates might get my vote - I 'm for better schools and free enterprise and all that - but the average Greenbriar citizen .... " In lieu of stating the obvious , I finished my wine . " What about the average Greenbriar citizen ? " said Juliana huffily . " The average Greenbriar citizen will find us morphologically unacceptable ? " said Serge haughtily . " Well ... yes , " I replied . " Unpleasantly odiferous ? " said Maxwell snippily . " That too . " " Homely ? " said Juliana defensively . " I would n't be surprised . " The sheep served dessert - raspberry and lemon sorbet - and the seven of us ate in silence , painfully aware that mutual understanding between myself and the Common Sense Party would be a long time coming . During the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my superego , one extraction per day . On the Fourth of July , the shepherd unwound my bandages . Although I disbelieved his assertion to be a trained nurse , I decided to humor him . When he pronounced that my head was healing satisfactorily , I praised his expertise , then listened intently as he told me how to maintain the incision , an ugly ring of scabs and sutures circumscribing my cranium like a crown of thorns . As the hot , humid , enervating month elapsed , the Common Sense candidates finished devising their strategies , and the campaign began in earnest . The piano barn soon overflowed with shipping crates full of leaflets , brochures , metal buttons , T-shirts , bumper stickers , and pork-pie hats . With each passing day , my skepticism intensified . A goat running for Borough Council ? A pig on the School Board ? A bull guiding the Planning Commission ? Pollifex 's menagerie did n't stand a chance . My doubts received particularly vivid corroboration on July 20th , when the doctor staged a combination cocktail party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but ardent population of political progressives inhabiting Greenbriar , Pollifex had identified thirty of the wealthiest . Two dozen accepted his invitation . Although these potential contributors were clearly appalled by my bifurcation , they seemed to accept Pollifex 's explanation . ( I suffered from a rare neurological disorder amenable only to the most radical surgery . ) But then the candidates themselves sauntered into the living room , and Pollifex 's guests immediately lost their powers of concentration . It was n't so much that Maxwell , Juliana , and Serge looked like an incompetent demiurge 's roughest drafts . The real problem was that they 'd retained so many traits of the creatures to which they 'd been grafted . Throughout the entire event , Juliana stuffed her face with canapes and petits fours . Whenever Serge engaged a potential donor in conversation , he crudely emphasized his points by ramming his horns into the listener 's chest . Maxwell , meanwhile , kept defecating on the living-room carpet , a behavior not redeemed by the mildly pleasant fragrance that a vegetarian diet imparts to bovine manure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal speeches , the pledges stood at a mere fifty dollars , and every guest had manufactured an excuse to leave . " Your idea is never going to work , " I told Pollifex after the candidates had returned to their respective barns . We were sitting in the doctor 's kitchen , consuming mugs of French roast coffee . The door stood open . A thousand crickets sang in the meadow . " This is a setback , not a catastrophe , " said Pollifex , brushing crumbs from his white dinner jacket . " Maxwell is a major Confucius scholar , with strong Kantian credentials as well . He can surely become housebroken . Juliana is probably the finest utilitarian philosopher since John Stuart Mill . For such a mind , table manners will prove a snap . If you ask Serge about the Sermon on the Mount , he 'll recite the King James translation without a fluff . Once I explain how uncouth he 's being , he 'll learn to control his butting urge . " " Nobody wants to vote for a candidate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a while - before Greenbriar 's citizens appreciate this slate , but eventually they 'll hop on the bandwagon . " Pollifex poured himself a second cup of French roast . " Do you doubt that my mutants are ethical geniuses ? Can you imagine , for example , how they responded to the Prisoner 's Dilemma ? For three years running , I had used the Prisoner 's Dilemma in my Introduction to Philosophy class . It 's a situation-ethics classic , first devised in 1951 by Merrill Flood of the RAND Corporation . Imagine that you and a stranger have been arrested as accomplices in manslaughter . You are both innocent . The state 's case is weak . Even though you do n't know each other , you and the stranger form a pact . You will both stonewall it , maintaining your innocence no matter what deals the prosecutor may offer . Each of you is questioned privately . Upon entering the interrogation room , the prosecutor lays out four possibilities . If you and your presumed accomplice hang tough , confessing to nothing , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months in prison . If you admit your guilt and implicate your fellow prisoner , you will go scot free - and your presumed accomplice will serve a life sentence . If you hang tough and your fellow prisoner confesses-and-implicates , he will go scot free - and you will serve a life sentence . Finally , if you and your fellow prisoner both confess  --  and-implicate , you will each get a medium sentence , four years behind bars . It does n't take my students long to realize that the most logical course is to break faith with the stranger , thus guaranteeing that you wo n't spend your life in prison if he also defects . The uplifting-but-uncertain possibility of a short sentence must lose out to the immoral-but-immutable fact of a medium sentence . Cooperation be damned . " Your mutants probably insist that they would keep faith regardless of the consequences , " I said . " They would rather die than violate a trust . " " Their answer is subtler than that , " said Pollifex . " They would tell the prosecutor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pact , and in that you are correct . You further imagine that you can manipulate us into breaking faith with one another . But given your obsession with betrayal , I must conclude that you are yourself a liar , and that you will ultimately seek to convert our unwilling confessions into life sentences . I refuse to play this game . Let 's go to court instead . ' " " An impressive answer , " I said . " But the fact remains .... " Reaching for the coffee pot , I let my voice drift away . " Suppose I poured some French roast directly into my jar ? Would I be jolted awake ? " " Do n't try it , " said Pollifex . " I wo n't . " The mutant maker scowled strenuously . " You think I 'm some sort of mad scientist . " " Restore my brain , " I told him . " Leave the farm , get a job at Pfizer , wash your hands of politics . " " I 'm a sane scientist , Blake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I looked directly in his eyes . The face that returned my gaze was neither entirely mad nor entirely same . It was the face of a man who was n't sleeping well , and it made me want to run away . THE FOLLOWING morning , my routine wanderings along the farm 's perimeter brought me to a broad , swiftly flowing creek about twelve feet wide and three deep . Although the barbed-wire net extended beneath the water , clear to the bottom , I suddenly realized how a man might circumvent it . By redirecting the water 's flow via a series of dikes , I could desiccate a large section of the creek bed and subsequently dig my way out of this hellish place . I would need only one of the shovels I 'd spotted in the tool shed - a shovel , and a great deal of luck . Thus it was that I embarked on a secret construction project . Every day at about eleven A.M. , right after Karl took the specimen from my superego , I slunk off to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mud to the burgeoning levees , returning to the cottage in time for lunch . Although the creek proved far less pliable than I 'd hoped , I eventually became its master . Within two weeks , I figured , possibly three , a large patch of sand and pebbles would lie exposed to the hot summer sun , waiting to receive my shovel . Naturally I was tempted to tell Vickie of my scheme . Given my handicap , I could certainly have used her assistance in building the levees . But in the end I concluded that , rather than endorsing my bid for freedom , she would regard it as a betrayal of the Common Sense Party and its virtuous agenda . I knew I 'd made the right decision when Vickie entered our cottage late one night in the form of a gigantic mutant hen . Her body had become a bulbous mass of feathers , her legs had transmuted into fleshy stilts , and her face now sported a beak the size of a funnel . Obviously she was running for elective office , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time informing me . Her ambition , she explained , was to become Greenbriar 's next mayor . " I 've even got an issue , " she said . " I do n't want to hear about it , " I replied , looking her up and down . Although she still apparently retained her large and excellent breasts beneath her bikini top , their present context reduced their erotic content considerably . " Do you know what Greenbriar needs ? " she proclaimed . " Traffic diverters at certain key intersections ! Our neighborhoods are being suffocated by the automobile ! " " You should n't have done this , Vickie , " I told her . " My name is Eva Pullo , " she clucked . " These people have brainwashed you ! " " The Common Sense Party is the hope of the future ! " " You 're talking like a fascist ! " I said . " At least I 'm not a coward like you ! " said the chicken . For the next half-hour we hurled insults at each other - our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huff , eager to continue my arcane labors by the creek . In a peculiar way I still loved Vickie , but I sensed that our relationship was at an end . When I made my momentous escape , I feared , she would not be coming with me . Even as I redirected the creek , the four mutant candidates brought off an equally impressive feat - something akin to a miracle , in fact . They got the citizens of Greenbriar to listen to them , and the citizens liked what they heard . The first breakthrough occurred when Maxwell appeared along with three other Planning Commission candidates - Republican , Democrat , Libertarian - on Greenbriar 's local-access cable channel . I watched the broadcast in the farmhouse , sitting on the couch between Vickie and Dr. Pollifex . Although the full-blooded humans on the podium initially refused to take Maxwell seriously , the more he talked about his desire to prevent the Route 80 Extension from wreaking havoc with local ecosystems , the clearer it became that this mutant had charisma . Maxwell 's eloquence was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He committed no fecal faux pas . " That bull was on his game , " I admitted at the end of the transmission . " The moderator was enchanted , " enthused Vickie . " Our boy is going to win , " said Pollifex . Two days later , Juliana kicked off her campaign for School Board . Aided by the ever-energetic Vickie , she had outfitted the back of an old yellow school bus with a Pullman car observation platform , the sort of stage from which early twentieth-century presidential candidates campaigned while riding the rails . Juliana and Vickie also transformed the bus 's interior , replacing the seats with a coffee bar , a chat lounge , and racks of brochures explaining the pig woman 's ambition to expand the sex education program , improve services for special-needs children , increase faculty awareness of the misery endured by gay students , and most audacious of all - invert the salary pyramid so that first-grade teachers would earn more than high-school administrators . Day in , day out , Juliana tooled around Greenbriar in her appealing vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform , speaking to citizens privately in the lounge , and somehow managing to check her impulse toward gluttony , all the while exhibiting a caliber of wisdom that eclipsed her unappetizing physiognomy . The tour was a fabulous success - such , at least , was the impression I received from watching the blurry , jerky coverage that Vickie accorded the pig woman 's campaign with Pollifex 's camcorder . Every time the school bus pulled away from a Juliana Sowers rally , it left behind a thousand tear-stained eyes , so moved were the citizens by her commitment to the glorious ideal of public education . Serge , meanwhile , participated in a series of " Meet the Candidates " nights along with four other Borough Council hopefuls . Even when mediated by Vickie 's shaky videography , the inaugural gathering at Greenbriar Town Hall came across as a powerful piece of political theater . Serge fully suppressed his impulse to butt his opponents - but that was the smallest of his accomplishments . Without slinging mud , flinging innuendo , or indulging in disingenuous rhetoric , he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand firm against what he called " the insatiable greed of Consumerland . " Before the evening ended , the attending voters stood prepared to tar-and-feather any discount chain executive who might set foot in Greenbriar , and it was obvious they 'd also embraced Serge 's other ideas for making the Borough Council a friend to local business . If Serge 's plans came to fruition , shoppers would eventually flock to the downtown , lured by parking-fee rebates , street performers , bicycle paths , mini-playgrounds , and low-cost supervised day care . As for Vickie 's mayoral campaign - which I soon learned to call Eva Pullo 's mayoral campaign - it gained momentum the instant she shed her habit of pecking hecklers on the head . Vickie 's commitment to reducing the automobile traffic in residential areas occasioned the grandest rhetorical flights I 'd ever heard from her . " A neighborhood should exist for the welfare of its children , not the convenience of its motorists , " she told the local chapter of the League of Women Voters . " We must not allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for community and connectedness , " she advised the Chamber of Commerce . By the middle of August , Vickie had added a dozen other environmentalist planks to her platform , including an ingenious proposal to outfit the town 's major highways with underground passageways for raccoons , badgers , woodchucks , skunks , and possums . You must believe me , reader , when I say that my conversion to the Common Sense Party occurred well before the Greenbriar Daily Times published its poll indicating that the entire slate - Maxwell Taurus , Juliana Sowers , Serge Milkovich , Eva Pullo - enjoyed the status of shoo  --  ins . I was not simply trying to ride with the winners . When I abandoned my plan to dig an escape channel under the fence , I was doing what I thought was right . When I resolved to spend the next three years nursing the Pollifex Farm candidates from my cerebral teat , I was fired by an idealism so intense that the pragmatists among you would blush to behold it . I left the levees in place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . THE ATTACK ON Pollifex Farm started shortly after eleven P.M. It was Halloween night , which means that the raiders probably aroused no suspicions whatsoever as , dressed in shrouds and skull masks , they drove their pickup trucks through the streets of Greenbriar and down Spring Valley Road . To this day , I 'm not sure who organized and paid for the atrocity . At its core , I suspect , the mob included not only yahoos armed with torches but also conservatives gripped by fear , moderates transfixed by cynicism , liberals in the pay of the status quo , libertarians acting out anti-government fantasies , and a few random anarchists looking for a good time . Whatever their conflicting allegiances , the vigilantes stood united in their realization that Andre Pollifex , sane scientist , was about to unleash a reign of enlightenment on Greenbriar . They were having none of it . I was experiencing yet another version of the student 's dream - this time I 'd misconnected not simply with one class but with an entire college curriculum - when shouts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Taking hold of the library cart , I roused Vickie by ruffling her feathers , and side by side we stumbled into the parlor . By the time we 'd made our way outside , the windmill , tractor shed , corn crib , and centaur stables were all on fire . Although I could not move quickly without risking permanent paralysis , Vickie immediately sprang into action . Transcending her spheroid body , she charged into the burning stables and set the mutant horses free , and she proved equally unflappable when the vigilantes hurled their torches into Maxwell 's residence . With little thought for her personal safety , she ran into the flaming piano barn , located the panicked bull man and the equally discombobulated pig woman - in recent months they 'd entered into a relationship whose details need n't concern us here - and led them outside right before the roof collapsed in a great red wave of cascading sparks and flying embers . And still the arsonists continued their assault , blockading the main gate with bales of burning hay , setting fire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a raging inferno . Catching an occasional glimpse of our spectral enemies , their white sheets flashing in the light of the flames , I saw that they would not become hoist by their own petards , for they had equipped themselves with asbestos suits , scuba regulators , and compressed air tanks . As for the inhabitants of Pollifex Farm , it was certain that if we did n't move quickly , we would suffer either incineration , suffocation , or their concurrence in the form of fatally seared lungs . Although I had never felt so divided , neither the fear spasms in my chest nor the jumbled thoughts in my jar prevented me from realizing what the mutants must do next . I told them to steal shovels from the tool shed , make for the creek , and follow it to the fence . Thanks to my levees , I explained , the bed now lay in the open air . Within twenty minutes or so , they should be able to dig below the barbed-wire net and gouge a dry channel for themselves . The rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking out for Karl , Serge , and Dr. Pollifex so that I might direct them to the secret exit . Vickie kissed my lips , Juliana caressed my cheek , Maxwell embraced my brain , and then all three candidates rushed off into the choking darkness . Before that terrible night was out , I indeed found the other Party members . Karl lay dead in a mound of straw beside the sheep barn , his forehead blasted away by buckshot . Serge sat on the rear porch of the farmhouse , his left horn broken off and thrust fatally into his chest . Finally I came upon Pollifex . The vigilantes had roped the doctor to a maple tree , subjected him to target practice , and left him for dead . He was as perforated as Saint Sebastian . A mattock , a pitchfork , and two scythes projected from his body like quills from a porcupine . " Andre , it 's me , Blake , " I said , approaching . " Blake ? " he muttered . " Blake ? Oh , Blake , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . Vickie got away , and Maxwell too , and Juliana . " " I was a sane scientist , " said Pollifex . " Of course , " I said . " There are some things that expediency was not meant to tamper with . " " I agree . " " Pullo for Mayor ! " he shouted . " Taurus for Planning Commission ! " I replied . " Milkovich for Borough Council ! " he shouted . " Sowers for School Board ! " he screamed , and then he died . There 's not much more to tell . Although Vickie , Juliana , Maxwell , and I all escaped the burning farm that night , the formula for the miraculous serum died with Dr. Pollifex . Deprived of their weekly Altruoid injections , the mutants soon lost their talent for practical idealism , and their political careers sputtered out . Greenbriar now boasts a mammoth new Consumerland . The Route 80 extension is almost finished . High school principals still draw twice the pay of first-grade teachers . Life goes on . The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Caesar 's Palace in Atlantic City . A few songs , some impersonations , a standup comedy routine - mostly vegetarian humor and animal-rights jokes leavened by a sardonic feminism . The crowd ate it up , and Juliana seemed to be enjoying herself . But , oh , what a formidable School Board member she would 've made ! When the Route 80 disaster occurred , Maxwell was devastated - not so much by the extension itself as by his inability to critique it eloquently . These days he plays piano at Emilio 's , a seedy bar in Newark . He is by no means the weirdest presence in the place , and he enjoys listening to the customers " troubles . But he is a broken mutant . Vickie and I did our best to make it work , but in the end we decided that mixed marriages entail insurmountable hurdles , and we split up . Eventually she got a job hosting a preschool children 's television show on the Disney Channel , Arabella 's Barnyard Band . Occasionally she manages to insert a satiric observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after hearing the tenth neurosurgeon declare that I am beyond reassembly , I decided to join the world 's eternal vagabonds . I am brother to the Wandering Jew , the Flying Dutchman , and Marley 's Ghost . I shuffle around North America , dragging my library cart behind me , exhibiting my fractured self to anyone who 's willing to pay . In the past decade , my employers have included three carnivals , four roadside peep shows , two direct-to-video horror movie producers , and an artsy off  --  Broadway troupe bent on reviving Le Grand Guignol . And always I remain on the lookout for another Andre Pollifex , another scientist who can manufacture QZ-11-4 serum and use it to turn beasts into politicians . I shall not settle for any sort of Pollifex , of course . The actual Pollifex , for example , would not meet my standards . The man bifurcated me without my permission , and I can not forgive him for that . The scientist I seek would unflinchingly martyr himself to the Prisoner 's Dilemma . As they hauled him away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would turn to the crowd and say , " The personal cost was great , but at least I have delivered a fellow human from an unjust imprisonment . And who knows ? Perhaps his anguish over breaking faith with me will eventually transform him into a more generous friend , a better parent , or a public benefactor . " Alas , my heart is not in the quest . Only part of me - a small part , I must confess - wants to keep on making useful neurological donations . So even if there is a perfect Pollifex out there somewhere , he will probably never get to fashion a fresh batch of Altruoid . Not unless I father a child - and not unless the child receives the gene - and not unless the gene finds expression - and not unless this descendent of mine donates his superego to science . But as the bull man told me many years ago , QZ-11  --  4 only rarely gets actualized in the humans who carry it . I believe I see a way around the problem . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a llama named Loretta . She can count to ten and solve simple arithmetic problems . I am enchanted by Loretta 's liquid eyes , sensuous lips , and splendid form - and I think she has taken a similar interest in me . It 's a relationship , I feel , that could lead almost anywhere .
