My son is 4 years old . His father and I broke up a year ago , and since then whenever I date I 'm careful not to let my child meet my male friends . My ex , on the other hand , lets our son be around his girlfriends . I 've told him I do n't think it 's healthy , but he says our son is too young to notice . What do you think ? Kudos , mother ! Your decision to keep your child from meeting your male friends is admirable . Experts agree that it is sensible to limit the number of dates you introduce to your children . At age 4 , kids do , in fact , notice male-female interactions . Larry E. Davis , Ph.D. , social psychologist and author of Black and Single : Meeting and Choosing a Partner Who 's Right for You ( Ballantine ) , asserts that youngsters are always observing and learning important lessons about what is appropriate behavior for intimate relationships . Too many faces can be confusing . Children may also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Davis explains that single parents sometimes form what experts call codependent relationships with their children . That is , the single mother or father will overly involve their children in the adult aspects of their lives . In such cases , the boundaries of the parent-child relationship become blurred and overlap , resulting in what family therapists call enmeshed roles . Davis says this is not healthy . Your son 's father should limit the child 's interaction with his dates because the youngster may form short-lived attachments to these women . This can be a very disappointing and disheartening experience for a child . Your young son may get the idea that people just come and go and that life is a series of unstable relationships . Without knowing it , the father is teaching his son what I call Kleenex **26;1586;TOOLONG behavior . To address this matter , the next time your son 's father comes over , you must have another talk with him about his dating habits as they relate to your son 's welfare . Share your concerns about how too many interactions with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that limiting the child 's exposure to his dates is the best option . Let him know that his son does not need to be involved in his love life . For example , you might say " I know you want to be a good father , but you need to know that our son is old enough to notice and be affected by the different women in your life . Please keep your dating separate from your parenting role . Our son does n't need to know about your personal life unless you 're planning to get married . He needs to grow up in a wholesome environment created by both of us . " If you need to employ the expertise of a social worker , child psychologist or minister , do so . Sometimes parents have to resort to mediation and expert opinion when a child 's welfare is at stake . I am a 14-year-old girl who 's dating a 17-year-old boy . I feel I 'm ready to have sex with him , and I want to start using birth control . I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to talk to her about sex . What 's the best way to approach her ? Many teens find it difficult to talk to their parents about sex , and parents themselves are not always at ease about the subject . Some parents have difficulty even thinking of their teenage children as sexual . Your mother may be uncomfortable with the topic , but it 's important to talk about your feelings and your developing sexuality . But first you should realize that birth control is only one facet of your decision to have sexual intercourse . Deciding to wait to have sex is one sure way to avoid pregnancy and catching a sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) . Teens are at particularly high risk for STDs , in part because of risky sexual practices , according to the American Social Health Association ( ASHA ) . It is estimated that more than 3 million teenagers are infected with an STD annually , accounting for one fourth of all new cases . Lack of knowledge can also place you in jeopardy . For some teens , abstinence is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a choice . Do n't get involved in sexual intercourse until you have learned about the consequences . You should seek medical and parental guidance .

Also try the organization 's Web site for teenagers at www.teenwire.com for more information . Another question to consider is whether you 're being pressured to go further in your relationship . When someone you like wants to do something , it can be hard to say no . And of course the old standard " you would if you loved me " has an intimidating effect on some girls . In Changing Bodies , Changing Lives : A Book for Teens an Sex and Relationships ( Random House ) , author Ruth Bell explains that most of what we 've heard , seen or learned about sexuality all points in one direction-toward sexual intercourse . Bell believes the importance of intercourse has been so exaggerated in books , magazines and movies that people forget that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After you have acquired more information about sex and considered your motivations , you 're ready to approach your mother about the subject .

Then discuss dating and the challenges involved in relationships . Finally , share your feelings about wanting to become sexually involved with the boy you are dating and explain how you came to this decision .

My husband recently ended an affair with a female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our marriage . However , he and his coworker are still friends . I am troubled by this . What should I do ? First , the two of you must establish whether his affair was just a one-time occurrence , a sign of chronic unfaithfulness or a love affair threatening the marriage . Through discussion and/or marital counseling you need to pinpoint the reasons for his adultery . Experts say there are many reasons why men cheat : need for sex , ego , boredom , opportunity , habit , adventure , true love or anger at their spouse . To prevent future affairs , both of you must talk about the motivations for his unfaithfulness . If you do not , the pattern may be repeated , with his coworker or someone else . Then you and your husband must identify guidelines that will prevent future infidelity . Number one on the list must be creating distance between him and his coworker .

Even with this restriction , in some cases the desire for the woman 's company may persist , Harley says . Without counseling , your husband places himself in a very emotionally compromising and vulnerable situation . Harley also explains that an affair is a severe blow to a spouse 's self esteem . You should talk with your minister or a counselor about your feelings of personal worth and value in this marriage . The good news is that most affairs do not lead to divorce , studies show . And couples sometimes develop stronger negotiating skills after the marriage has been challenged by infidelity . Communication becomes the focal point in the relationship , upon which the couple establishes a team effort that helps to restore and fortify trust . Harley points out that trust can be restored despite the obvious pain and disappointment . It is a long and arduous process , but with forgiveness , commitment and love . it can be done .
