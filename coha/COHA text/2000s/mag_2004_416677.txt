Xbox hacks alter the basic code , called the BIOS , to let it run Linux ( see " The Chipless Linux Install " at right ) or , with a mod chip , any other code you can find or write . These chips are soldered onto the motherboard and give you not only a full Linux PC but an Xbox that can back up games to the hard drive , emulate other consoles , even play wacky Japanese import games . Better still , the mod chip can be turned on and off with an external switch , so Microsoft never has to know it 's there .
