What does 13-year-old Taylor Hern ? ? Lots of things : the actor Ewan McGregor , the color pink , the band My Chemical Romance , her boyfriend Alex . You would know all that if you visited her Xanga , a blog  --  home-page hybrid that is the modern teen 's public and interactive equivalent of a diary . You could even leave a comment on her Xanga or send her an " eProp " if , say , you ? Ewan McGregor too . <P> On April 18 , Taylor , who is about to enter eighth grade at Lost Mountain Middle School in Kennesaw , Ga. , got an instant message ( IM ) from her friend Sydney Meyer that said , " OMG Oh , my God OMG OMG go to your xanga . " Someone using the screen name lmmsgirlsgot2hell had left Taylor a comment that read , " Go to my Xanga , bitch . " Taylor did  --  and found a List of Hos . Her name was on it . The list was hurtful , but Taylor says she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cheerleading chicks spazzed , " she says . " Me and all my friends thought it was stupid . Who would actually make time in their schedule to do something like that ? " <P> Turns out , many of her peers would . Technology has transformed the lives of teens , including the ways they pick on one another . If parents and teachers think it 's hard to control mean girls and bullying boys in school , they have n't reckoned with cyberspace . Cyberbullying can mean anything from posting pejorative items like the List of Hos to spreading rumors by e-mail to harassing by instant message . It was experienced in the preceding two months by 18% of 3,700 middle schoolers surveyed by researchers at Clemson University . Their study is scheduled to be presented at this month 's American Psychological Association meeting . The phenomenon peaks at about age 13 ; 21% of eighth-graders surveyed reported being cyberbullied recently . And incidents of online bullying are like roaches : for every one that 's reported , many more go unrecorded . " Our statistics are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Part of the problem is kids not recognizing that what 's happening is a form of bullying . " <P> Online bullying follows a gender pattern that 's the opposite of what happens off-line , the Clemson study found . On playgrounds and in school hallways , boys are the primary perpetrators and victims ; online , girls rule . Nearly a third of the eighth-grade girls surveyed reported being bullied online in the previous two months , compared with 10% of boys ; 17% of the girls said they had bullied online , but only 10% of the boys said they had . Such stats get an eye roll from teens . " Girls make up stuff and sooooooo much drama , " Taylor said ( by IM , of course ) . " Drama queens . " <P> On the Internet , you can wear any mask you like  --  and that can be harrowing for the victim of a cyberbully . A few weeks after the List of Hos was posted , Taylor 's classmate Courtney Katasak got an IM from someone using the screen name ToastIsYummy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen name , so she asked , WHO IS THIS ? ToastIsYummy responded with teasing lines and a link to a porn site . " Then they kept sending me these inappropriate messages , " she says . " I blocked the screen name so they could n't talk to me , but I did n't know who this person was or what they were trying to do . It freaked me out . "
