Heather Lindsley 's story " Just Do It " appeared in our July 2006 issue . She has also published stories in Strange Horizons , Talking Back , and she has also written and directed several plays . At the moment , she lives in London where she is finishing up a novel based on Norse mythology . Her new story for us also deals with mythology , though perhaps not in the most serious of ways .... <p> ATALANTA WAS DOING sit-ups when the goddesses pounded on her door . " Two hundred thirty-seven , " she said with the exhale , then " Who is it ? " The response was a chorus that sounded to Atalanta like Athenphroditemis . " Oh , " said Atalanta to herself . " Oh , this can not be good . " " We heard that , " the chorus said . " Sorry , " said Atalanta as she opened the door . A blink-inducing divine glow - along with Athena 's spear , Artemis " bow , and Aphrodite 's cleavage - made her add quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Trivia bee , " said Athena . " We need a human on the team . " " It 's in the rules , " said Aphrodite . " Stupid rule , " said Artemis . " Trivia bee ? " saidAtalanta . " Uh , that is n't really my thing . Should n't you ask , I do n't know , Medea ? Medea 's smart . " " She creeps me out , " said Aphrodite . " And she 's a sore loser , " said Artemis . " And then we would n't be the A Team , " said Athena . " The what ? " said Atalanta . " The A Team , " Athena said . " Our team name . Every team in the trivia bee has a name . " " What about Arachne ? " Atalanta ventured , immediately regretting it . She did n't like the look in Athena 's storm-gray eyes . There could be lightning . " She 's ... indisposed , " Athena said . " Just say you 'll do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time separating Aphrodite 's charm from the threat . " Fine , I 'll do it , " Atalanta said . " When is it ? " " Now , " said Athena . " Welcome , gods and goddesses , deities and designers , demons and humans , and spirits of all ages , to the Seventeenth Millennial Interpantheonic Trivia Bee ! " The Sphinx stalked across an unadorned stage , flicking her tail and the microphone 's cord into the same sinuous arc . " I 'm glad to see so many teams participating in what 's sure to be the most exciting charity event of the season . " " What , this ? " said Atalanta . The hall could have been a junior high cafetorium if not for its massive scale and the absence of stale institutional food odors . " I know it does n't look like much , " Athena said , testing a dry erase marker on the white board their team was issued when they registered , " but really , it 's very prestigious . " " Uh huh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stackable . Very nice . " " Forget the hall , " Artemis said . " Forget the chairs . Forget that sticky spot on the floor - " " What is that sticky spot ? " said Atalanta , sliding her sandaled foot away . " Probably blood . This hall gets used for a lot of stuff . Ritual sacrifices , showdowns between Good and Evil , potlucks . " Artemis leaned closer to the pale green flecked linoleum floor and examined the stain . " Maybe it 's gravy . " " Let 's call it gravy , " said Atalanta . " Fine , it 's gravy . Now forget the gravy . Just remember it 's all about winning . " The Sphinx moved to the edge of the stage . " Before we get started , I 'd like to take a moment to welcome back the winner of the last three Interpantheonic Trivia Bees , the Eye of the Tigris : Inanna , Nanna , Utu , and Enheduanna ! " A knot of supporters at the back of the hall broke into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose from their circle of plastic chairs and hefted last year 's trophy in the air , eliciting more cheers . " Oh , please . " Aphrodite rolled her eyes . " What a bunch of show-offs . " " You 're just jealous of Inanna 's breasts , " Athena said . " Am not , " said Aphrodite . " So , " the Sphinx said , " let 's have an evening of good fun , good sportsmanship , and remember - " here she indulged in a particularly wide smile , " the decisions of the judges are final . " " Look , " said Athena , pointing past the Sumerians , " Dad 's playing . " " Who 's with him ? " Artemis asked . " I ca n't see around those Mayans . What is it with agriculture gods and their corn headdresses ? " Athena had to lean back to see . " Apollo and Hermes . " " And who 's their human ? " asked Artemis . Aphrodite answered without looking . " Hippomenes . " " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hippomenes . " Aphrodite nudged Atalanta . " You 've met him . He 's cute , do n't you think ? " " Eh . " Atalanta shrugged . " Not really my type . Kinda scrawny . And he throws like a girl . " " You throw like a girl , " said Athena . " I throw like a .... " Atalanta was about to say goddess but remembered that hubris did n't go over well with this crowd . " I throw like a woman , " she finished . " Nice save , " said Artemis . " And now , " the Sphinx cleared her throat , " the first question . What is the speed of light in a vacuum expressed as Egyptian royal cubits per second ? " " Starting with the easy ones , as usual , " said Apollo . He scrawled numbers across the white board . " Yeah , " said Zeus , curling his beard around a finger . " Easy ones . Hey , check out the cubits on the Swedish metal bikini team over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't mess with them . " " Why not ? They look like they 'd appreciate a good bolt . " " Focus , " said Apollo as he wrote down the last few digits . " Why ? " Zeus leaned back in his chair . " You 've got it covered . " " Not if you keep distracting me , " Apollo said . " I almost forgot to carry the one . " " Where 's Atalanta ? " said Hippomenes . " I ca n't find her . " " Over there , " said Hermes , " on the other side of the Sumerians and behind the Mayans . See ? " Hippomenes just nodded , not taking his eyes off Atalanta once he 'd found her in the crowd . " I told you Aphrodite would get her here . Now , are you ready ? " Hippomenes turned back to Hermes . " Are you sure this is going to work ? " " How could she resist ? " said Hermes . " I do n't know , kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme , do n't you think ? " " I have to do it , " said Hippomenes . " My heart belongs to her . " " Yeah , " said Zeus , " but there 's no need to be so literal about it .... " Hippomenes looked at Hermes and took a deep breath . " Let 's go . " " This may hurt a little at first , " Hermes said . Hippomenes put his hands defensively over his chest . " How much is " a little ' ? " " Sorry , I 'm just messing with you , " said Hermes . " It wo n't hurt at all now . " He pushed his hand into Hippomenes " chest . " But I ca n't guarantee it wo n't hurt like hell later . " Hermes pulled out a golden apple and held it for a moment before passing it to Hippomenes . Hippomenes turned it in his hands , mesmerized by a surface glowing like rosy liquid gold in sunlight , just transparent enough to reveal the heart within . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , swaying a little . " Are you sure you want to give it up ? " Zeus asked . Hippomenes did n't answer . He just walked to the edge of their circle and rolled the apple away . " OOOH , " said Aphrodite when she saw the rolling apple . " Shiny ! " " No ! " shouted Athena and Artemis as they tackled Aphrodite . " Ow ! Cut it out ! " said Aphrodite . " No golden apples ! " Artemis insisted . " You remember what happened last time , " said Athena . " Yes , I remember what happened last time , it was a ten-year war , of course I remember ! You two harpies are never going to let me forget it . " " Harpies ? " said Artemis . " That 's a little harsh , do n't you think ? " Athena said . " Yeah , " said Artemis . " Whatever , " said Aphrodite . " Anyway , the golden apple is obviously for Atalanta . " " How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name 's on it . " Atalanta took the golden apple Aphrodite offered her . " There 's more writing on the back , " said Athena . Atalanta turned the apple . " Youstandon the peaks of this pulse , " she read . " You live in these chambers . " She thrust the apple at Aphrodite , who refused to take it back . Artemis peered at the apple . " Yep , that 's a heart . " " Anatomically correct , too , " said Athena . " I mean , jamming it into an apple has distorted it a little , but it 's all there . " " It 's warm , " said Atalanta . " And beating . " " It 's a beautiful gesture , " said Aphrodite . " Do n't you think ? " " It 's Round Two , " the Sphinx announced before Atalanta could answer , " and with a twenty-three-way tie it 's still anybody 's game . Let 's raise the level of difficulty . The question : what does human birth feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artemis . " That 's ambiguous , " protested Athena . " Do they mean the feeling of passing through a birth canal , or the feeling of pushing something through a birth canal ? " " Either way , " said Aphrodite , " ick . " " Well ? " Artemis poked Atalanta in the ribs . Atalanta looked up from the apple . " Well what ? " " What 's the answer ? " said Athena . " What was the question ? " Atalanta asked , her eyes back on the apple . " Hippomenes ? " Apollo said . " Hey , do n't look at me , " he answered . " Just put " Like having your skull cracked open , ' " said Zeus . " Can you see what Team Holy Holy Holy is writing ? " Hermes said . " The chick in the blue shawl looks like she 's on it . " " Number one , that 's cheating , " Apollo said . " And number two , no , I ca n't see . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning his attention back to Hippomenes . " They 're gon na be a tight fit . Better exhale first . " " I have , " said Hippomenes . " If you can talk you have n't exhaled enough , " said Hermes . " Fine , " huffed Hippomenes through collapsed cheeks . " Oh , come on , you 're not even trying ! Do you want to win her or not ? " Hippomenes blew out the last of the air in his lungs . " There ! Got " em ! " Hermes gave another golden apple to Hippomenes , who staggered forward and tossed the apple with less accuracy than his previous effort . Hermes redirected the apple with a flick of his wrist , maneuvering it past divine toes , claws , and paws until it bumped into the dusty sandals of Hippomenes " beloved . Artemis poked at the apple with one finger . " What is that in there , a sponge ? " " Okay , why would he send a sponge ? " said Aphrodite . " What 's romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be romantic ? " asked Artemis with surprise . " It 's not a sponge . " Atalanta showed the apple to Athena . " You before air , " Athena read . " Lungs . " " What 's romantic about lungs ? " said Artemis . " Exactly , " said Atalanta . " What kind of guy sends body parts ? " Her eyes widened with the horror of a new idea . " Hey , what if they 're not even his ? What if these are ex-lover body parts ? " " They are not ex-lover body parts , " declared Aphrodite . " They 're his . Given as a pledge of eternal love . I can tell . You should thank him . " " I should find him and kick his ass . Unless of course his ass is already rolling its way over here encased in a golden apple . " " That 's silly , " said Aphrodite . " Why would he send his ass ? " " Why would he send his heart and his lungs ? " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's poetic , " Aphrodite said . " It 's creepy , " said Atalanta . " Would you two keep it down ? " hissed Athena . " I ca n't hear the Sphinx . " " - British pop sensation achieved success by contracting with Ah Puch the Destroyer ? " asked the Sphinx . " Oh , great , " said Artemis . " A gim me for the Mayans . " Athena looked at Aphrodite . " Typical , " Aphrodite pouted . " You do n't listen when I tell you the fifteenth multiplicative perfect number is thirty-nine , but along comes a question about the Spice Girls and you just assume I have the answer at my perfectly manicured fingertips . " " So , " Athena said , " it 's the Spice Girls ? " Aphrodite sighed . " Yes it 's the Spice GkIs . Of course it 's the Spice Girls . " " Are you sure it 's not Petula Clark ? " Apollo asked . " It 's the Spice Girls , I 'm telling you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it might be Petula Clark , " said Apollo . " Look , I know it 's the Spice Girls , because I put a lot of time and effort into ranking them according to who was most deserving of my thunderous Olympic ambrosia . Fkst was - " " Okay okay , it 's the Spice Girls , " said Apollo . " Look , I 'm writing it down . Just stop talking about your thunderous Olympic whatever . " " Ambrosia , " said Zeus . " Nectar of the God , baby . " " So Hippomenes , " Hermes said , " you might want to get that image out of your head before we do this . " " I 'm trying , " said Hippomenes . " Really . " " And it 's best if you 're thinking of her , " Hermes said . He rested his palm on Hippomenes " temple . " But , uh , it might send the wrong impression if you 're thinking of her naked . " " Hey , I wan na see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaty palm . " Ow ! " said Hippomenes . " Wow , " said Zeus . " No wonder you 're tossing body parts . " " Just ignore him , " Hermes said , prodding Zeus away , " and think happy thoughts . " He sunk his hand wrist-deep into Hippomenes " forehead and pulled out a third golden apple . The apple flickered below its surface . " What is that ? " said Zeus . " Lightning ? " " Mostly thoughts , " said Hermes as he put the apple in Hippomenes " hands , " with a few dreams mixed in to keep it interesting . " Hippomenes moved blindly toward Atalanta . Hermes grabbed him by the tunic . " Just send her the apple , kid . " Hippomenes stood dazed at the edge of the circle , his eyes locked on Atalanta . He did n't throw the apple - it seemed to leap from his hand , then twisted through the crowd without any guidance from Hermes . " So , " Apollo whispered to Hermes , " heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he living on ? " " Hope , " said Hermes . " What , " said Zeus , " that shabby little thing at the bottom of Pandora 's box ? " " Yep , " said Hermes . " And what 's he thinking with ? " said Apollo . Hermes tipped his head toward his belt . " So - the usual , " Zeus said . " No thought without you in it , " Atalanta read . " No dream that is n't you . " " That 's so romantic , " said Aphrodite . " It 's scary , " said Atalanta . " It 's charming , " said Aphrodite . " It 's obsessive , " said Atalanta . " Shut up , " said Artemis and Athena together . " - cow does tri-tip come from ? " finished the Sphinx . " What ? " said Athena . " Wait , I know this , it 's the saddle , " Artemis said . " I mean , if it 's the same as venison . " " Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably . Why would n't it be ? " " Well , if that 's all we 've got .... " Athena wrote SADDLE on the white board . The Sphinx called time and the teams lifted their boards . " Dammit , " said Artemis . " Sirloin . That 's what I meant . " " What 's that on the Sumerian board , under the answer ? " said Aphrodite . " It 's a diagram of a cow , " said Athena , " with a little star where tri-tip comes from . " " No way , " said Artemis . " Were we supposed to do that ? " said Aphrodite . " No , " said Athena . " They 're just showing off . They 've been illustrating their answers since the beginning . They drew a pretty good Ben Franklin in Round Four . " " Unbelievable , " grumbled Artemis . " - and now , " said the Sphinx , " with the scores tallied I 'm happy to announce the winners of Seventeenth Millennial Interpantheonic Trivia Bee ... for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Dammit , dammit , dammit , " said Artemis . " Dammit . I thought we had them this year . That 's it , I need to go hunt something . You 'd better come with me , " she said , nudging Athena . " Nobody needs a pissy war goddess on the loose . " " I am not , " Athena flashed , " pissy . " " Whatever , " said Artemis . " A little sylvan slaughter will do you good . Let 's go shoot something in the sirloin . " She waved goodbye to Atalanta and whispered to Athena , " Next time we 're bringing Medea . I do n't care how creepy she is . " Atalanta waved back , then stooped to gather the three golden apples in her arms . " What are you going to do with those ? " Aphrodite said . " Give them back , " Atalanta called over her shoulder as she stalked off through the dispersing crowd . Hermes appeared at Aphrodite 's side . " Well , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you think he can pull it off ? " Aphrodite stared after Atalanta 's determined stomp . " She 's going to make applesauce out of him . " " Wan na watch ? " " No . " Aphrodite said , turning away . " You know how I hate to lose . " " I THINK THESE belong to you . " Atalanta thrust the apples at Hippomenes , who was a bit more clearheaded now . " No , " he said , pushing the apples back , " they really do n't . " " Well , they do n't belong to me , either . " " They 're in your hands . That means they 're yours . " " Take them , " said Atalanta . " No . " Atalanta knelt down and began to place the apples carefully on the ground . Hippomenes took the fact that she did n't just drop them as an encouraging sign . " That wo n't make any difference , " he said . " Even walking away wo n't make any difference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Atalanta stood up , one apple still in her hand . She stared at him , her expression incomprehensible to Hippomenes , a man unacquainted with the more extreme forms of female anger . Atalanta drew back her arm and hurled the apple at him . The golden apple shattered against Hippomenes " chest , vanishing into a gust that drove the breath into him . He shot the breath back out , letting it carry the only thing he wanted to say . " I love you , " he said . " You do n't even know me . " " Yes , I do . " " Prove it , " she said . She realized his intention too late , and when she lunged for the flickering apple she clasped his hand instead . She held on for a moment , the apple in his hand , his hand in hers . He smiled . She jerked away , arms wrapped around her head as she ran . Hippomenes lobbed the golden apple . It followed Atalanta 's darting path until it hit the crown of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would have cursed , but was overwhelmed by the sensation of knowing clearly and precisely what another person thought of her . " Wow , " she said , staring into space . " Oh , no , " said Hippomenes as he ran to Atalanta . " Are you okay ? " He held her shoulders , frightened at her dazed look . " Oh . Oh no . That did n't turn you into me , did it ? No . No no no no , that would be bad . I do n't want that . I just wanted you to know what I thought . Atalanta ? " He shook her . " Atalanta ? " She looked up at him , eyes focused at last and expression distinctly hers . " You really think my front teeth are a little crooked ? " she asked . " That 's what you take away ? " Hippomenes said in disbelief . " You get the sum of my thoughts about you and that 's the one you take away ? " " I like that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , crazy . Like you still have some sense of perspective . " " Well , yeah , your teeth are a little crooked . And , you know , you 're not exactly graceful . And frankly I think your left br - " " Yeah , okay , I got it . " " Sorry , " he said . " And you really think this could be a terrible mistake but you want to do it anyway ? " " Well , yeah , " Hippomenes said . " But anything could be a terrible mistake . " They stood over the last apple in silence , watching it pulse . " What are we going to do with this ? " Atalanta finally said . Hippomenes did n't answer . Atalanta picked the apple up . She stared at it . " It 's very pretty , " she said . " Beautiful , really . " " Thank you , " he said . She stepped toward him , apple resting upright in her palm . She held it out , just inches from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Probably , " he said . Atalanta did n't know if Hippomenes was reaching for her or for the apple , but in the end her arms were tight around him , the rosy golden apple crashed into nothing between them . When she kissed him he tasted tart , and sweet , a welcome crisp autumn after a long summer , and the slight metallic tang of heart 's blood was easy to ignore . And if afterward his heartbeat had the faintest echo , she never noticed . It was too close to her own .
