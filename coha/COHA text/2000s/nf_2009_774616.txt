Green : The Fenian Dynamiters // One friends across the ocean // Irish grievances against the British in the nineteenth century were many . The British had garrisoned Ireland with troops , and favoured the industrious Protestant Scots-Irish of the North , because they suspected that its predominantly Roman Catholic inhabitants would rebel with the aid of a foreign foe at the first opportunity . In addition to the Ulster Presbyterians , there was an established , that is privileged , Protestant Church of Ireland , even though most of the population were Catholics . There was a fine Protestant university , Trinity College , Dublin , but none for Catholics . Ireland was part of a global empire , but was often treated as an offshore agricultural colony where labourers and poorer tenant farmers lived in chronic insecurity at the whim of absentee English landlords . Millions had left for the US ( and industrialising Britain ) where they adopted radical views that were far in advance of those of most people in Ireland itself . Confronted by virulent strains of American Protestantism , they compensated for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as latterday Normans and sentimentalising the old country with its ancient barrows , bogs , castles and mists . That these were historically authentic was partly due to their being noted , from 1824 onwards , on detailed Ordnance Survey maps , while another British intrusion - the national census - ironically contributed to a growth of Irish cultural nationalism . Successive censuses had startling revelations . Whereas in 1845 half the population spoke Irish ( or Gaelic ) , by 1851 this had fallen to 23 per cent , and below 15 per cent forty years later . The Gaelic League was born of a desire for an Irish-Irish patriotic literature at a time when the brightest stars in that firmament were Anglo-Irish Protestant nationalists like J. M. Synge , Sean O'Casey or W. B. Yeats . 1 // Many complexities about the real , as opposed to imaginary , Ireland were lost in the Atlantic translation as fond hearts filled with hatred . Irish volunteers for the British army , replete with their own Catholic military chaplains , won a disproportionately high number of Victoria Crosses during the Crimean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High Anglican prime minister William Ewart Gladstone , combined with British nonconformists to disestablish the anomalous Church of Ireland in 1869 . Partly due to the disruptive ingenuity of a caucus of Irish MPs in the House of Commons , notably under Charles Stewart Parnell , and endemic rural criminality , Land Acts alleviated the insecurity of the smallest class of tenants . Finally , more and more British politicians , led eventually by Gladstone himself , were persuaded that Ireland 's future lay in some degree of Home Rule , with separate legislatures benefiting both England and Ireland , the two countries joined at a more exalted level for defence or foreign policy by an imperial parliament continuing to sit at Westminster . That prospect , which became real enough on the eve of the First World War , was sufficient for the Protestant majority in Ulster to seek German arms to preserve their membership of a more developed **25;30;TOOLONG industrialised axis , if necessary detached from the benighted clerical South . 2 // Irish terrorism grew out of a venerable insurrectionary tradition that was manifestly failing by the mid-nineteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervening lull in the late 1960s . The older history created many of the myths and martyrs of the more recent Troubles , as well as patterns of behaviour and thought that have survived in armed Irish republicanism within our lifetimes . There were many malign ghosts . // On 17 March 1858 an organisation was founded in Dublin by a railway engineer called James Stephens . It was St Patrick 's Day . Within a few years this mutated into the Irish Republican Brotherhood , although that name was never employed as widely as ' Fenians ' . This referred to a mythical band of pre-Christian Irish warriors , or the Fianna , roughly similar to romantic English legends about the Knights of King Arthur . For the English it meant a dastardly gang of murdering desperadoes . Fenianism encompassed a range of activities , with harmless conviviality and labour activism at the legal end of the spectrum , through to rural disturbances , insurrection and terrorism on the illegal margins Incubated in the political underworld of Paris , or the rough-and-ready slums of North America 's eastern seaboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with arcane rituals , masonic oaths and signs , a major reason why the Roman Catholic Church was largely unsympathetic . The general goal was the ' disenthralment ' of the Irish race and the achievement of an Irish republic through violent struggle , all this within a broader context of Gaelic cultural self-assertion to which there has been some allusion . 3 // The strategy , ultimately derived from the 1798 Wolfe Tone rebellion , was to transform British imperial difficulties into Irish opportunities . The imperial difficulties included the Crimean War , the Indian Mutiny and the Zulu , Sudan and Boer Wars , as well as crises in British relations with France in the 1850s , with the US in the 1860s , and with Russia in the 1870s , for a war with any of these would enhance the prospects of an independent Irish republic . While the number of Irish heroes in the Crimea seemed to suggest that this strategy had failed , the Fenians took courage from the war 's exposure of Britain 's military deficiencies and the barely concealed rift with its French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even the mahdi 's ' swarthy desert warriors ' became objects of Fenian interest , a trend that would continue into the late twentieth century in the form of Irish Republican Army links with the Palestine Liberation Organisation and Libya . 4 // The Fenians drew upon the wider Irish emigration , whether in mainland Britain or the United States of America . They included refugees from the conditions that had produced the mid-nineteenthcentury famine , of which many Irish-Americans had raw memories . Life in the urban Irish ghettos of the US ( or industrial Britain ) was primitive . The Irish were also heartily disliked by the Protestant aristocracy that dominated the US , a fact which may explain their flight into a vehement Irishness which had much purchase in Boston or ' New Cork ' . The American Civil War marked an important turning point since Britain was perceived to have supported the Confederate South , at a time when 150,000 Irish-Americans were fighting predominantly for the North . The Irish-Americans would inject Fenianism with money and military expertise . //       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
