Two manufacturers , Aqua-Lung and McNett , use chlorine dioxide to disinfect water . Both claim the drops , when mixed correctly , take care of Giardia and crypto . Gravity-feed filter ( GF ) . When time is no object , gravity-feed filters are the way to go . Just scoop some water into the reservoir , hang the thing on a tree , then wait as the water trickles through the filter element into a receptacle . No tired arms , no aching knees from squatting next to a stream . Iodine ( 10 ) . Add this chemical-in liquid , tablet , or crystal form-to water , wait 20 minutes ( longer with cold water ) , then chugalug .

Carbon cartridges also make nasty water taste a little better . Ceramic ( CE ) . This naturally porous material snares microorganisms as water passes through it . The best thing about ceramic filters is their lifespan ; they can be cleaned time and again before needing replacement . The drawback : Ceramic is fragile , brittle , and prone to cracking in cold weather . Depth filter ( DF ) . Most modern filters are depth filters , meaning that the filtering element is thick enough to strain out microorganisms when you pump water through . Look for depth filters that can be cleaned with a brush and/or backwashed . Fiberglass or glass fiber ( FG ) . Glass fibers are long and slick and can be molded into intricate structures that catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ceramic does , but it 's less likely to break when dropped in cold weather .

Some manufacturers have devised their own secret method for treating water . ELIMINATES Bacteria ( BA ) . Bacteria range in size from 0.2 to 10 microns and can cause all sorts of unpleasantries , such as food poisoning and typhoid fever . Cryptosporidium ( CR ) . Crypto is a particularly tenacious and hard-shelled protozoan .

Take precautions when hiking near agricultural lands or industry and when using discolored or smelly water . You should assume that any river that is far from its source has been contaminated . Protozoa ( PR ) . These are hard-shelled , single-cell parasites , aka cysts , that range from 2 to 15 microns in size . The Giardia lamblia cyst is one of the most common waterborne parasites in the United States . Viruses ( VI ) . The smallest of waterborne evils ( 0.004 to 0.1 microns ) , viruses carry diseases like polio and hepatitis . Inoculation is certainly the best protection against such diseases . Experts disagree on the prevalence of viruses in U.S. waters , but the risk definitely exists in some foreign countries .

Take a few minutes to look over the owner 's manual . Be sure that the maintenance and troubleshooting sections are clear and detailed , since you 'll eventually find yourself sitting by a stream trying to get you filter cranking again . 7 DRY OUT EARLY AND OFTEN .

When dipping from a particularly muddy stream , let the brown stuff settle to the bottom of a pot before pumping it . -K . Hostetter // <p>
