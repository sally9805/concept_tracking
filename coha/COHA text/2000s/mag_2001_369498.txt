Imagine your life this way . <P> You get up in the morning and breakfast with your three kids . One is already doomed to die in infancy . Your husband works 200 miles away , comes home twice a year and sleeps around in between . You risk your life in every act of sexual intercourse . You go to work past a house where a teenager lives alone tending young siblings without any source of income . At another house , the wife was branded a whore when she asked her husband to use a condom , beaten silly and thrown into the streets . Over there lies a man desperately sick without access to a doctor or clinic or medicine or food or blankets or even a kind word . At work you eat with colleagues , and every third one is already fatally ill . You whisper about a friend who admitted she had the plague and whose neighbors stoned her to death . Your leisure is occupied by the funerals you attend every Saturday . You go to bed fearing adults your age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors and your political and popular leaders act as if nothing is happening . <P> Across the southern quadrant of Africa , this nightmare is real . The word not spoken is AIDS , and here at ground zero of humanity 's deadliest cataclysm , the ultimate tragedy is that so many people do n't know  --  or do n't want to know  --  what is happening . <P> As the HIV virus sweeps mercilessly through these lands  --  the fiercest trial Africa has yet endured  --  a few try to address the terrible depredation . The rest of society looks away . Flesh and muscle melt from the bones of the sick in packed hospital wards and lonely bush kraals . Corpses stack up in morgues until those on top crush the identity from the faces underneath . Raw earth mounds scar the landscape , grave after grave without name or number . Bereft children grieve for parents lost in their prime , for siblings scattered to the winds . <P> The victims do n't cry out . Doctors and obituaries do not give the killer its name . Families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence heralds victory for the disease : denial can not keep the virus at bay . <P> The developed world is largely silent too . AIDS in Africa has never commanded the full-bore response the West has brought to other , sometimes lesser , travails . We pay sporadic attention , turning on the spotlight when an international conference occurs , then turning it off . Good-hearted donors donate ; governments acknowledge that more needs to be done . But think how different the effort would be if what is happening here were happening in the West . <P> By now you 've seen pictures of the sick , the dead , the orphans . You 've heard appalling numbers : the number of new infections , the number of the dead , the number who are sick without care , the number walking around already fated to die .
