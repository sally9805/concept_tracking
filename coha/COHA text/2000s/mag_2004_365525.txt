Before Christophe Echeverri decided to spin his postdoctoral project into a biotech company called Cenix BioScience in 1999 , he hesitated , fearing the switch from lab coat to business suit was a " move over to the dark side . " Echeverri had been invited to turn the research he was doing at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg into a commercial venture under the well-endowed wing of the Max Planck Institute , Germany 's elite scientific research body . Echeverri did n't hesitate long , seeing the opportunity as a once-in-a-lifetime chance to prove that his theories actually worked . So when the new Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics opened in Dresden in January 2001 , Echeverri and his team moved in . Now , from its new labs , Cenix is working with drugmakers like Bayer AG to develop medicines based on an understanding of the roles of specific genes . <P> The creation of Cenix was not only a big switch for Canadian-born Echeverri , who loved the world of pure science . It also marks a shift for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charting a new course to make Germany a major player in biotech research and development . Cenix is steaming in the right direction . " We 're part of the wave of development that happened when the government and investment community made the push into biotech , " says Echeverri , 35 , his dark eyes darting to his cell phone to check text messages . " This year we 're going to make a profit , and a five-year-old German biotech company that 's making a profit is rare . " <P> It 's also rare for a North American to go to Germany to start a high-tech business ; usually , the traffic in entrepreneurs goes the other way . Cenix demonstrates how far Germany has come over the past few years as it tries to promote the creation of science-based businesses and stem an outflow of its best minds to the U.S. Max Planck had been a " large , slow-moving beast , " says Echeverri , but when the idea for Cenix was born , it was Max Planck that acted as the midwife and pushed Echeverri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come into being were it not for the extraordinary assistance and support that both the company and I personally received from the Max Planck Institute , " says Echeverri . <P> But the institute in Dresden  --  and others like it dotted around Germany  --  is starting to do things differently . Traditionally , German research universities are rigidly hierarchical . The head of the laboratory gets all the resources and , if there 's a breakthrough , all the credit . The Dresden Max Planck Institute takes a more laissez-faire  --  in fact , a more American  --  approach . Its faculties are modeled after U.S. universities in which postdoctorate researchers have better access to funding , doing away with the top-down approach . The Dresden institute is also aggressively trying to attract researchers from outside Germany . " We are adapting the U.S. system to Europe , " says Kai Simons , director of the institute . " The big advantage the U.S. has is that it gives resources to young minds at an early phase . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
