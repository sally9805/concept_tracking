Down a dead-end road , behind the glitter of the city 's casinos , the fading pink garage doors of a storage business stand closed , their interiors hidden from the desert sun . <p> Police Detective Mark Reddon has stared at the row of doors , wondering . <p> He has read the investigative reports , the witness statements . He knows what people have told police about the owner of the storage business and about three people who have vanished . <p> He wonders if that mystery will ever be unraveled . <p> " More than likely , " he says , " we 're not going to be able to solve this until we find a body . " <p> At first , Diana Leone 's disappearance in February 2000 was hardly noticed . After all , she 'd left the man she lived with , David Lee Morgan , many times before , but always came back . Months went by and no one seemed to care that the mother of two was gone . <p> Reddon got the case eight months after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Morgan , owner of the storage business where he and Leone had lived for years , did n't want to talk . He told friends his girlfriend had run off with another man . <p> But as Reddon delved deeper into Morgan 's background , he uncovered a startling mystery : Morgan 's second wife , Marie , had disappeared in 1980 and her lover had n't been heard from since . <p> What had happened to them ? And why , 20 years later , did another woman disappear ? <p> As a businessman , David Lee Morgan was tough , says Keith Grimes , his former business consultant . " When somebody missed their rent he 'd take their stuff and throw it away , " Grimes says . <p> Morgan was a big talker , but Grimes never quite knew if he was serious , especially when he mentioned there was a reason why there were so many bumps in the desert . <p> Though police say they are investigating Morgan , they are n't naming him as a suspect . <p> Morgan did n't return several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said neither he nor his client would comment . <p> Diana Leone first met David Lee Morgan when she was just 17 . He was 50 . Her sister 's boss introduced the two and soon Leone began working for Morgan at Aabacus Storage , collecting rent and answering the phone . <p> When she was 19 , she moved in with him and his two children from a previous marriage . Soon , the couple had two children of their own . After a few years , the family moved from their home to the second floor of the storage business , not far from the Las Vegas Strip . <p> Morgan 's company was doing well and he also had a furniture moving service , which took him away from home for weeks at a time . Police believe he 's worth $2 million . <p> The relationship between Morgan and Leone was rocky , according to Leone 's best friend , Patty Killian , and sister , who spoke on condition her name would not be used . Leone had to have reconstructive surgery several times from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was charged with attempted murder - accused of beating Leone after accusing her of infidelity . She was hospitalized with two broken bones in her right leg , a fractured arm and facial bones . <p> " David Morgan returned home unexpectedly from an out-of-state trip , and upon entering their residence he hit Diana Miller ( Leone ) on the right side of her face with a metal pipe ... , " a police affidavit reads . " David Morgan stated over and over that he was going to kill her . " <p> But Leone refused to cooperate with the prosecution , and the case was dismissed . <p> Morgan was arrested again in 1999 , charged with battery against Leone . <p> " Diana stated that David became enraged and slapped her in the face , causing a cut to her left ear , " a police report reads . <p> Diana told police another fight erupted the next day and " David punched her in the face . " Police found no visible marks on Leone that time . <p> " Diana stated she had been drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again the charge was dismissed , this time after Morgan completed anger management counseling . <p> Each time Leone and Morgan would fight , Leone 's sister and friend say , she would seek shelter at their homes , but always she returned to Morgan . <p> Not much was said , or asked , about the whereabouts of Morgan 's second wife , Marie , who vanished in 1980 . His first wife is living in Southern California . <p> But Leone had her suspicions . She told police investigating the 1989 domestic violence case that she was told by David and Marie 's children that Marie was dead . <p> " The son ... told me major stuff about where he thinks she 's buried and all the time he used to beat her up , " Leone said in the taped interview . <p> Leone 's sister used to remind her of Marie 's disappearance , but " she said , ' I 'll take care of him , " ' the sister says . <p> Though they were together 18 years , Leone would never marry Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Marie , " Killian says . " She was a wife and she was never heard from again . " <p> What police have is bits and pieces of information , mostly two decades old . Not enough , they say , to bring charges . <p> In 1980 , Marie 's sister , Kim Smith , told detectives what she knew about Marie 's lover , Gabriel Vincent . He disappeared in 1979 , when he was 56 . <p> A police search warrant application quotes Smith as saying that Morgan " had confessed to her that he had killed Gabriel Vincent after learning of his affair with Marie . " <p> " Smith stated that David told her he had waited for Gabriel in the bushes outside the storage units and when Gabriel showed up to meet with him about the affair , David shot Gabriel in the testicles and after making Gabriel suffer , shot and killed him , " the report continues . <p> " David buried the body and covered it with quick lime , " the police report says , quoting Smith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later , in 1985 , investigators received another account involving Morgan . His sister , Deloris Morgan , told about the brother she had always feared . <p> One day in 1980 , Morgan called her and asked her to meet him at his home , Deloris Morgan said . A police search warrant continues the story : <p> " David told her he had shot and killed Marie because she was going to leave him . David informed Deloris that he had taken the body out past Indian Springs and buried the body along the highway . <p> " David then forced Deloris at gunpoint to go back out to where he had buried the body of Marie and move it . Deloris reported she drove with David to the area of mile marker 124 on Highway 95 and they uncovered a dead body that was tied up in a blanket . <p> " They moved the body further out into the desert area and buried it in a deeper hole that Deloris helped David dig . <p> " Deloris stated that some months later David again forced her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 55-gallon drum with water in the back of his truck and drove it out to the gravesite . David carried bags of cement out into the desert while he forced Deloris to haul buckets of water so he could pour cement over the gravesite . " <p> But when she tried to show the alleged gravesite to detectives in 1985 , Deloris could n't find the location . A search of a two-mile surrounding area found no clues . Searches by volunteers recently also turned up nothing . <p> David Morgan , now 70 , never gave a statement to police , and Reddon is n't sure if police ever contacted him . The case is so old the original detectives are dead and so is Deloris . She died in 1997 . <p> Diana Leone told her sister that she thought Marie 's body had been relocated to a house they lived in before she and Morgan moved in above the storage business . <p> " She had told her sister that she thought the house was haunted because David had buried Marie under the house , " Reddon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the concrete slab remains . Police say they plan to search with radar equipment . <p> Despite the detailed statements , the investigation quickly stalled . Morgan was never charged . No search warrants were sought for the house and storage units , police said , because detectives lacked any substantial evidence to support the stories of Smith and Deloris Morgan . <p> " Back then it was probably harder to convince a jury of a homicide without a body , " Reddon says . " Nowadays you 've seen it more frequently . It was pretty much unheard of back in the 80s . " <p> In November , police went to Morgan 's home above the storage shed with a search warrant seeking human remains , blood stains on the carpet and Leone 's car . <p> Her car was there and blood drops were on the carpet in the house , but there were no human remains . The carpet is being tested to see if the blood belongs to Leone . <p> While police were there , David and Diana 's 6-year-old daughter , Lea , drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl . <p> Reddon says : " When she handed the drawings to the sergeant , she said , ' Do you know where my mommy is ? " ' <p> The child also told detectives about a fight her parents had shortly before the last time she saw her mother , according to a police report . <p> " Lea stated they were arguing over David 's belief that Diana was having an extramarital affair ... , " it says . " Lea stated that David shoved Diana through a plate glass window in the patio area of the home and then smashed Diana 's head into the refrigerator . <p> " After the fight Lea remembers that a large square of carpet was removed from her mother 's bedroom . " <p> " Lea asked me if I miss her mommy as much as she does , " Killian says . " I told her that wherever she is , I 'm sure that she still loves her . " <p> Wherever Diana Leone is , wherever Marie Morgan is , wherever Gabriel Vincent is , the detective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the body , " Reddon says . " We have n't been able to find the last one . There 's a good chance we 're not going to find this one . " <p> End Adv for Sunday , Feb. 25 <p>
