Why He-Man , Care Bears , and Miami Vice are making a comeback . <p> FOR THREE DAYS EACH JUNE , NEW York 's cavernous Jacob Javits Convention Center becomes ground zero for an annual confab known as the Licensing Show , in which several hundred food , film , and toy companies convene in an orgy of T-shirts , dolls , trinkets , and practically anything else that can be licensed , franchised , marketed , or sold . Between the crowds and the costumed characters ( Big Bird , Mickey and Minnie ) prowling the aisles , the show is like Disney World for marketers and retailers . It also has more than a touch of Tomorrowland : It 's the place to go for a preview of pop culture . <p> Yet there was something oddly familiar about this year 's offerings : Hasbro trotted out a Godzilla-sized Tonka Truck ; Mattel reintroduced Hot Wheels cars ; and the Cartoon Network touted its $20-million resurrection of the ' 80s cartoon smash " He-Man and the Masters of the Universe , " along with 25 new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fox Broadcasting plugged upcoming revitalizations of such dubious 1980s fare as the Cabbage Patch Kids and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , while Yogi Bear , the Jetsons , Strawberry Shortcake , and the treacly Care Bears were ubiquitous on T-shirts . <p> Elsewhere , the story is similar . In August , People magazine paid homage to ' 80s country-club chic , showing photos of Matthew Broderick and Natalie Portman in Lacoste shirts . People 's sibling In Style breathlessly reported that Kate Hudson was snapping up ' 80s inspired guitar pick earrings , which feature song titles such as " Lucky Star " and " Call Me " imprinted on hideously mismatching bright pink and orange picks . Television airwaves are also returning to the ' 80s : NBC 's " The ' 80s Show " vies with Nick at Nite 's " Threes Company , " and " Facts of Life " ( and coming soon , " Family Ties " and " Cheers " ) . Movies in the works for 2003 and beyond include Ang Lee 's remake of " The Incredible Hulk , " plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hogans Heroes , " " I Dream of Jeannie , " and even that ' 80s stalwart , " Miami Vice . " A poster on display at the Javits Center that displayed the hirsute former sitcom star A.L.F . ( currently enjoying an unlikely comeback alongside fellow ' 80s relic Mr. T in television ads for 1-800-Collect ) neatly captured the prevailing ethos : " Retro is in . Just stick with me , boys  --  this Spider-Man thing is just a phase " Indeed , retro  --  Generation X retro , specifically-is back . For what was most notable about this year 's glimpse of the future is how much it looked like the past . <p> Chances are if you 're already intimately familiar with these figures  --  if your Christmas list once included Cabbage Patch Kids , if you idled away your pre-adolescent afternoons watching " He-Man " and " Starsky and Hutch " reruns , if there was ever a time in which you unselfconsciously wore Izod shirts  --  you came of age in the 1980s . And chances are if any of the above elicited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of Generation X  --  one of the 46 million Americans born between 1965 and 1978 . ( Or , if you prefer , anyone too young to remember the Kennedy assassination and too old to have had a cell phone in college . ) For a few brief years , before the dot-com boom eclipsed them , Gen Xers were a staple of nationwide media coverage , known chiefly for their irony , ennui , and general self-loathing . That and their visceral hatred for the self-absorbed , self-important Baby Boom generation that preceded them . <p> So it 's more than a little , er , ironic that a generation unified by its disgust with the Baby Boomers ' nauseating glorification of its youth culture should now be wallowing in its own . But after scanning the Licensing Show lineup of what will soon constitute pop culture 's next big things , one ca n't help but notice a curious difference : Unlike earlier strains of generational nostalgia , Generation X chooses to celebrate not the best of its youth , but the worst . Scooby Doo-Doo <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80s culture best left in the attic  --  or the dumpster ? Like many trends , this one is driven in part by Hollywood 's marketing groupthink . If Charlie 's Angels hit it big at the box office two years ago , it must follow that America is starving for big-screen versions of " Scooby Doo " and " Starsky and Hutch . " And now that Xers are hitting the age when they 're able to call the shots at movie and television studios , they want to mark their own territory  --  and it does n't hurt to do it in ways that stick it to their elders . On Nick at Nite , the all-reruns-all-the-time cable channel launched 15 years ago as a way to milk Boomer nostalgia , " The Dick Van Dyke Show " and " Mary Tyler Moore " have been shunted to TV 's equivalent of a nursing home : the TV Land channel . After all , Nick at Nite had to make room for ' 80s vintage cornball shows like " Threes Company " and " The Facts of Life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the new Scooby Doo are calculated to appeal to the whole family : Xer parents can reminisce about the many episodes in which some haggard old villain nabbed by the gang grumbled about " you meddling kids , " while their kids are kept happy with that age-old preteen pleaser : flatulence jokes . The same fun-for-the-whole-family ploy is at work in Old Navy 's fall ad campaign . A takeoff on the " Brady Bunch , " complete with theme song , the ads lure media-savvy Gen X moms and dads into the stores  --  " It 's a Sunshine Day " playing in an endless loop  --  to buy Old Navy rugby shirts for their kids . ( It does n't hurt that Xers are also the ones who can spot ' 80s icon Morgan Fairchild as Mrs. Brady in the commercial , which makes us feel in on the joke . ) <p> Another explanation for the explosion of Gen X touchstones , The New York Times recently noted , is that Hollywood these days is longer on inventory than creativity . It 's cheaper and easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rights to , such as " Transformers " and " The Partridge Family , " than to risk trying something new . Finally , there 's the axiom of modern life that everyone reaches an age at which they feel the need to revisit the culture of their youth . Believe it or not , the oldest Xers are already pushing 40 . <p> What is completely different about Generation X nostalgia , though , is that it 's the first without pretense that what it 's fetishizing was really all that great to begin with . Consider its predecessors . " Greatest Generation " nostalgia is all about celebrating real achievement ( fighting World War II ) and timeless music ( swing ) . Those who came of age in the 1950s are honestly wistful for the innocent pleasures of Perry Como , Chubby Checker , and sock hops . And , of course , Baby Boomers take inordinate pride in the acid-laced youth culture they experienced ( the Beatles , the Stones , Hendrix ) and social movements they took part in ( civil rights , anti-war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast , seems to pride itself on wallowing in the worst that decade has to offer . NBC recently debuted " The Rerun Show , " in which an eight-member troupe reenacts episodes of campy old sitcoms in a way that 's part love-in , part lampoon , turning familiar characters into punch lines . In a " The Facts of Life " skit , the overweight Natalie eats to the point of breaking furniture , while the nauseatingly bubbly Tootie now bounces like a bobble-head doll . A " Diff'rent Strokes " sendup paints beneficent millionaire Mr. Drummond as a pedophile . Over at VH1 , pioneer of the hour-long documentary about rock stars ' hackneyed descents into drugs and alcohol , the chase for the Gen X audience is on . A new show called " Ultimate Albums " chronicles the " creativity and clashes , hassles and headaches " of such dubious ' 80s classics as Def Leppard and Bon Jovi . Even current bands can get in on the ' 80s racket : Mien Ant Farm made its reputation ( and a platinum record ) largely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smooth Criminal , " their video for which gleefully parodies every moon-walking , crotch-grabbing , embarrassing ' 80s excess . Surviving Wham ! <p> This tendency to focus on the worst culture of our youth is well in keeping with the characteristics that defined Generation X in the first place . Most who grew up during the ' 80s remember life during that decade as unremittingly awful , and not without considerable justification . rise . The specter of Day After-style nuclear annihilation was drummed into students ' heads . And much of pop culture was indeed really , truly awful . Perhaps worst of all , we were forever cursed to follow in the wake of the most obnoxious , self-congratulatory generation in generations . As a character in author and Gen X-patron saint Douglas Coupland 's 1989 novel Generation X put it to his Boomer boss , " Do you really think we enjoy hearing about your brandnew million-dollar home when we can barely afford to eat Kraft Dinner sandwiches in our own grimy little shoe boxes and we 're pushing 30 ? A home you won in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your having been born in the fight time in history . And I have to endure pinheads like you rusting above me for the rest of my life , always grabbing the best piece of cake first and then putting a barbed-wire fence around the rest . You really make me sick . " <p> In the face of " Boomer envy " and the numerous other indignities we suffered , the coping mechanism most of us adopted ( and which Coupland so brilliantly chronicled ) was keeping an ironic distance and never appearing to take anything very seriously  --  after all , when pop culture stipulated legwarmers , hairspray , and Wham ! , it was the only viable way to maintain our dignity . Today 's Generation X nostalgia approaches the past in much the same way : as one big , silly , insider joke . Enduring Irony <p> The current ' 80s crop of cartoon favorites , sitcom has-beens , embarrassing pop relics , and fashion offenses takes what was essentially kitsch to begin with and parodies it . Instead of straightforward reruns and revivals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the second day of the Licensing Show , in response to the poster of A.L.F . needling Spider-Man , Marvel Comics ( which , of course , had a booth ) came up with a pitch-perfect rejoinder , hoisting its own poster of the Incredible Hulk choking the furry alien and shouting , " A.L.F . makes me angry ! " <p> At its best , Gen X nostalgia can produce pop culture that 's actually pretty enjoyable . The Cartoon Network has scored a hit with its new late-night show geared toward adults , " Harvey Birdman , Attorney at Law , " which takes an obscure Hanna-Barbera super-hero and cleverly recasts him as a lawyer fighting for the rights of animated characters . His clients include Shaggy and Scooby Doo , Fred Flintstone , and Yogi Bear and Boo Boo ; and plotlines address such timeless Gen X debates as whether or not Scooby and Shaggy were constantly stoned . <p> But more often , a campy celebration of schlock is just plain camp  --  or worse , just plain terrible . Last March , VH1 debuted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featured musical parlor games that included a sorry segment in which Reagan-era has-beens like Tiffany and Joey McIntyre picked out equally pathetic fellow has-beens ( Mike Reno from Loverboy ) from a lineup of impersonators . Mercifully , the show was cancelled after a month . <p> The most irritating trait of generational nostalgia is its selectivity , its remembrance of only that which fits a generation 's self-image . Those who pine for the simplicity of " Happy Days " and their ' 50s adolescence do n't like to be reminded of McCarthyism or segregation . Privileged Boomers prefer not to dwell on the fact that they spent their parents ' money to trash their parents ' values . Gen X nostalgia is also selective , but in just the opposite way : We do n't cherish the best , but the worst , employing the same arm's-length irony that saw us through the Reagan years , recessions , and the coke-snorting , yuppified , Bonfire of the Vanities excesses that never seemed to trickle down to us . So instead , we do now as we did then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we ignore what actually merits remembering about the culture of our youth , limited though it may be : the good music ( The Replacements , R.E.M. , and a less self-aware U2 ) , the worth-another-viewing movies and television ( Platoon , " Moonlighting " ) , and the transformative events we witnessed ( the fall of the Berlin Wall ) . Let 's skip the 101-ism ( Coupland 's neologism for self-analysis based on half-understood undergraduate psychology ) . The joke may be on us . But true to form , at least we 're in on it . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Scooby Doo <p> By Courtney Rubin <p> <p> COURTNEY RUBIN is a senior writer at Washingtonian . <p>
