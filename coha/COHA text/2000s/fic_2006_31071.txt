Coming Out By Danielle Steel Random House Danielle Steel Olympia Crawford Rubinstein was whizzing around her kitchen on a sunny May morning , in the brownstone she shared with her family on Jane Street in New York , near the old meat-packing district of the West Village . It had long since become a fashionable neighborhood of mostly modern apartment buildings with doormen , and old renovated brownstones . Olympia was fixing lunch for her five-year-old son , Max . The school bus was due to drop him off in a few minutes . He was in kindergarten at Dalton , and Friday was a half day for him . She always took Fridays off to spend them with him . Although Olympia had three older children from her first marriage , Max was Olympia and Harry 's only child . Olympia and Harry had restored the house six years before , when she was pregnant with Max . Before that , they had lived in her Park Avenue apartment , which she had previously shared with her three children after her divorce . And then Harry joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her divorce . And now , she and Harry had been married for thirteen years . They had waited eight years to have Max , and his parents and siblings adored him . He was a loving , funny , happy child . Olympia was a partner in a booming law practice , specializing in civil rights issues and class action lawsuits . Her favorite cases , and what she specialized in , were those that involved discrimination against or some form of abuse of children . She had made a name for herself in her field . She had gone to law school after her divorce , fifteen years before , and married Harry two years later . He had been one of her law professors at Columbia Law School , and was now a judge on the federal court of appeals . He had recently been considered for a seat on the Supreme Court . In the end , they had n't appointed him , but he 'd come close , and she and Harry both hoped that the next time a vacancy came up , he would get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , values , and passions-even though they came from very different backgrounds . He came from an Orthodox Jewish home , and both his parents had been Holocaust survivors as children . His mother had gone to Dachau from Munich at ten , and lost her entire family . His father had been one of the few survivors of Auschwitz , and they met in Israel later . They had married as teenagers , moved to London , and from there to the States . Both had lost their entire families , and their only son had become the focus of all their energies , dreams , and hopes . They had worked like slaves all their lives to give him an education , his father as a tailor and his mother as a seamstress , working in the sweatshops of the Lower East Side , and eventually on Seventh Avenue in what was later referred to as the garment district . His father had died just after Harry and Olympia married . Harry 's greatest regret was that his father had n't known Max . Harry 's mother , Frieda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seventy-six , who thought her son was a genius , and her grandson a prodigy . Olympia had converted from her staunch Episcopalian background to Judaism when she married Harry . They attended a Reform synagogue , and Olympia said the prayers for Shabbat every Friday night , and lit the candles , which never failed to touch Harry . There was no doubt in Harry 's mind , or even his mother 's , that Olympia was a fantastic woman , a great mother to all her children , a terrific attorney , and a wonderful wife . Like Olympia , Harry had been married before , but he had no other children . Olympia was turning forty-five in July , and Harry was fifty-three . They were well matched in all ways , though their backgrounds could n't have been more different . Even physically , they were an interesting and complementary combination . Her hair was blond , her eyes were blue , he was dark , with dark brown eyes , she was tiny , he was a huge teddy bear of a man , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and serious , though prone to easy laughter , especially when it was provoked by Harry or her children . She was a remarkably dutiful and loving daughter-in-law to Harry 's mother , Frieda . Olympia 's background was entirely different from Harry 's . The Crawfords were an illustrious and extremely social New York family , whose blue-blooded ancestors had intermarried with Astors and Vanderbilts for generations . Buildings and academic institutions were named after them , and theirs had been one of the largest " cottages " in Newport , Rhode Island , where they spent the summers . The family fortune had dwindled to next to nothing by the time her parents died when she was in college , and she had been forced to sell the " cottage " and surrounding estate to pay their debts and taxes . Her father had never really worked , and as one of her distant relatives had said after he died , " he had a small fortune , he had made it from a large one . " By the time she cleaned up all their debts and sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivers of blue blood and aristocratic connections . She had just enough left to pay for her education , and put a small nest egg away , which later paid for law school . She married her college sweetheart , Chauncey Bedham Walker IV , six months after she graduated from Vassar , and he from Princeton . He had been charming , handsome , and fun-loving , the captain of the crew team , an expert horseman , played polo , and when they met , Olympia was understandably dazzled by him . Olympia was head over heels in love with him , and did n't give a damn about his family 's enormous fortune . She was totally in love with Chauncey , enough so as not to notice that he drank too much , played constantly , had a roving eye , and spent far too much money . He went to work in his family 's investment bank , and did anything he wanted , which eventually included going to work as seldom as possible , spending literally no time with her , and having random affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what was happening , she and Chauncey had three children . Charlie came along two years after they were married , and his identical twin sisters , Virginia and Veronica , three years later . When she and Chauncey split up seven years after they married , Charlie was five , the twins two , and Olympia was twenty-nine years old . As soon as they separated , he quit his job at the bank , and went to live in Newport with his grandmother , the doyenne of Newport and Palm Beach society , and devoted himself to playing polo and chasing women . A year later Chauncey married Felicia Weatherton , who was the perfect mate for him . They built a house on his grandmother 's estate , which he ultimately inherited , filled her stables with new horses , and had three daughters in four years . A year after Chauncey married Felicia , Olympia married Harry Rubinstein , which Chauncey found not only ridiculous but appalling . He was rendered speechless when their son , Charlie , told him his mother had converted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympia enrolled in law school , all of which proved to him , as Olympia had figured out long before , that despite the similarity of their ancestry , she and Chauncey had absolutely nothing in common , and never would . As she grew older , the ideas that had seemed normal to her in her youth appalled her . Almost all of Chauncey 's values , or lack of them , were anathema to her . The fifteen years since their divorce had been years of erratic truce , and occasional minor warfare , usually over money . He supported their three children decently , though not generously . Despite what he had inherited from his family , Chauncey was stingy with his first family , and far more generous with his second wife and their children . To add insult to injury , he had forced Olympia to agree that she would never urge their children to become Jewish . It was n't an issue anyway . She had no intention of doing so . Olympia 's conversion was a private , personal decision between her and Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first husband was pompous , arrogant , and useless . Other than the fact that he was her children 's father and she had loved him when she married him , for the past fifteen years , Olympia found it impossible to defend him . Prejudice was Chauncey 's middle name . There was absolutely nothing politically correct about him or Felicia , and Harry loathed him . They represented everything he detested , and he could never understand how Olympia had tolerated him for ten minutes , let alone seven years of marriage . People like Chauncey and Felicia , and the whole hierarchy of Newport society , and all it stood for , were a mystery to Harry . He wanted to know nothing about it , and Olympia 's occasional explanations were wasted on him . Harry adored Olympia , her three children , and their son , Max . And in some ways , her daughter Veronica seemed more like Harry 's daughter than Chauncey 's . They shared all of the same extremely liberal , socially responsible ideas . Virginia , her twin , was much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was far more frivolous than her twin sister . Charlie , their older brother , was at Dartmouth , studying theology and threatening to become a minister . Max was a being unto himself , a wise old soul , who his grandmother swore was just like her own father , who had been a rabbi in Germany before being sent to Dachau , where he had helped as many people as he could before he was exterminated along with the rest of her family . The stories of Frieda 's childhood and lost loved ones always made Olympia weep . Frieda Rubinstein had a number tattooed on the inside of her left wrist , which was a sobering reminder of the childhood the Nazis had stolen from her . Because of it , she had worn long sleeves all her life , and still did . Olympia frequently bought beautiful silk blouses and long-sleeved sweaters for her . There was a powerful bond of love and respect between the two women , which continued to deepen over the years . Olympia heard the mail being pushed through the slot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed it on the kitchen table as she finished making Max 's lunch . With perfect timing , she heard the doorbell ring at almost precisely the same instant . Max was home from school , and she was looking forward to spending the afternoon with him . Their Fridays together were always special . Olympia knew she had the best of both worlds , a career she loved and that satisfied her , and a family that was the hub and core of her emotional existence . Each seemed to enhance and complement the other . Olympia was taking Max to soccer practice that afternoon . She loved her time at home with her children . The twins would be home later that day , after their own after-school activities , which in their case included softball , tennis , swimming , and boys , whenever possible , particularly in Virginia 's case . Veronica was more standoffish , shyer like her mother , and extremely particular about who she hung out with . Officially , Virginia was more " popular , " and Veronica the better student . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and were graduating in June . Charlie had been accepted at Princeton , like his father , and three generations of Walkers before him , but had decided to go to Dartmouth instead , where he played ice hockey , and Olympia prayed that in spite of that he would graduate with teeth . He was due home for the summer in a week , and after visiting his father , stepmother , and three stepsisters in Newport , he was going to work at a camp in Colorado , teaching riding and taking care of horses . He had his father 's love of equestrian pursuits , and was a skilled polo player , but preferred more informal aspects of the sport . Riding Western saddle all summer , and teaching kids , seemed like fun to him , and Olympia and Harry approved . The one thing Harry did n't think his stepson should do was waste a summer going to parties , like his father , in Newport . Harry thought Chauncey 's whole lifestyle , and everyone in it , was a waste of time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal more substance , and heart , than his father . He was a fine young man with a good head on his shoulders , a warm heart , and solid principles and beliefs .. The girls were going to Europe with friends as a graduation present , and Olympia , Harry , and Max were meeting them in Venice in August , and taking them on a driving trip through Umbria , to Lake Como , and into Switzerland , where Harry had distant relatives . Olympia was looking forward to the trip . Shortly after their return , she 'd be taking the girls to Brown , and after that there would be only Max at home with her and Harry . The house already seemed too quiet to her these days , with Charlie gone . Having the girls leave too would be a real loss to her . Already now , with graduation and freedom imminent , the girls were almost never home . She had already missed Charlie terribly for the past three years . She was sorry that she and Harry had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at nearly forty-five , she could n't see herself starting with diapers and nursing schedules all over again . Those days were over for her , and having Max in their life , to bind them even closer together , seemed like an incredible gift . Olympia ran to open the door as soon as she heard the bell , and there was Max , in all his five-year-old splendor , with a wide , happy grin , as he threw his arms around his mother 's neck and hugged her , as he always did when he saw her . He was a happy , affectionate little boy . " I had a great day , Mom ! " he said enthusiastically . Max loved everything about life , his parents , his sisters , his brother whom he seldom saw but was crazy about , his grandmother , the sports he played , the movies he watched , the food his mother served him , his teachers , and his friends at school . " We had cupcakes for Jenny 's birthday ! They were chocolate with sprinkles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fabulous occurrence , although Olympia knew from volunteering in his kindergarten class that they had a birthday , with cupcakes and sprinkles , nearly every week . But to Max , every day , and the opportunities it offered , was wonderful and new . " That sounds yummy . " She beamed down at him , noticing the paint splattered all over his T-shirt . He dropped his sweatshirt on a chair , and she saw that his new tennis shoes were covered with paint , too . Max was exuberant about everything he did . " Did you have art today ? " she asked , as he settled into a chair at the big round kitchen table , where the family shared most of their meals . There was a pretty dining room with antiques she had inherited , but they only used it for the rare dinner parties they gave , and holidays like Christmas , Chanukah , Passover , and Thanksgiving . They celebrated both sets of holidays , both Christian and Jewish , in fairness to all their children . They wanted them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mother-in-law had been leery of that , but now she privately admitted that she enjoyed it , " for the children . &; Continues ...
