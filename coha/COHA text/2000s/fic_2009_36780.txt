The man called Smoke looked at the new wanted poster tacked to a tree . This one had his likeness on it . He smiled as he looked at the shoulder-length hair and the clean-shaven face on the poster . The artist had done a dandy job . <p> But it in no way resembled the man who now called himself Buck West . <p> Kirby Jensen had been sixteen years old when the old mountain man called Preacher hung the nickname Smoke on him . Preacher had predicted that Smoke would turn out to be a very famous man . And he had . As one of the most feared gunfighters in all the west . <p> It was not a reputation Smoke had wanted or sought . <p> Smoke now wore his hair short-cropped . A neat , well-trimmed beard covered his face . He no longer wore one pistol in cross-draw fashion , butt-forward . He now wore his twin .44s butt back and the holsters tied down low . He was just as fast as before . And that was akin to lightning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a valley several hundred miles to the east . A valley so lovely it was nearly impossible to describe . <p> Nicole would have loved it . <p> Seven had gone dancing and prancing off , once more running wild and free . <p> Nicole . <p> He shook his head and pushed the face of his dead wife from his mind . He turned his unreadable , cold , emotionless brown eyes to the west . The midnight-black stallion he now rode stood steady under his weight . The man now called Buck stood six feet , two inches , barefooted . He weighed one eighty : all hard-packed muscle and bone . His waist was lean and his short hair ash-blond . <p> The stallion shook his head . Buck patted him on the neck . The stallion quieted immediately . The animal 's eyes were a curious yellow/green , a vicious combination that vaguely resembled a wolf 's eyes . The stallion had killed its previous owner when the man had tried to beat him with a board . Smoke had bought the horse from the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animal 's feelings and moods . <p> The stallion 's name was Drifter . <p> Smoke had carefully hidden his buckskins , caching them with his saddle and other meager possessions in the valley where the Appaloosa , Seven , now grazed and ran free with his brood of mares . <p> Smoke had very carefully pushed all thoughts of the past behind him . He had spent months mentally conditioning himself not to think of himself as the gunfighter Smoke . His name was now Buck . Last names were not terribly important in the newly opened western frontier , and it had been with a smile that Buck chose West as his last name . <p> Buck West . Smoke was gone-for a time . <p> Buck laughed . But it was more a dark bark , totally void of humor . <p> Drifter swung his head around , looking at the man through cold killer eyes . Buck 's packhorses continued to graze . High above , an eagle soared , pushing and gliding toward the west . Buck could have sworn that it was the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot-out at the silver camp not far from the Uncompahgre . At least fourteen men had died under his guns that smoky , bloody day . And he had taken more than his share of lead , as well . It had taken him months to fully recover . <p> Many months back , in the southwestern corner of Wyoming , he had seen the first wanted poster . <p> WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE THE OUTLAW AND MURDERER SMOKE JENSEN 10,000.00 REWARD CONTACT THE SHERIFF AT BURY , IDAHO TERRITORY <p> He had removed the wanted poster and tucked it in his shirt pocket . He knew he would see many , many more of the dodgers as he made his way west . He had looked up to watch an eagle soar high above him , gliding majestically northwestward . <p> He had said , with the big skies and grandeur of the open country as witnesses , " Take a message with you , eagle . Tell Potter and Richards and Stratton and all their gunhands that I 'm coming to kill them . For my Pa , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outlaw . And they 'll die just as hard as Nicole did . You tell them , eagle . Tell them I 'm coming after them . " <p> The eagle had circled , dipped its wings , and flown on . <p> Buck shook away the memories , clearing his head of things dead and buried and gone . He let the smoldering coals of revenge burn on , deep within his soul . He would fan the coals into white-hot flames when branding time arrived . And he would do the branding-with hot lead . <p> The man who had earned the reputation as one of the most feared gunfighters in the newly opened west spoke gently to Drifter and the big cat-footed stallion moved out through the timber . <p> Buck was just west of the Rockies , skirting south of the Gros Ventre Range . He would-unless he hit some sort of snag-make Moose Flat in two days . Once at the Flat , he would camp for a few days and rest Drifter . Then he would ride for Bury , Idaho Territory . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is exactly what I intend to do to Stratton and Richards and Potter : bury them ! <p> It was cool during the day and flat-out cold at night ; early spring when Buck crossed the still ill-defined line into Idaho Territory . He had seen several bands of Indians , but they had left him alone . He knew they 'd seen him , for this was their country , and they knew it as intimately as the roots of a tree knows the earth that nurtures it . But Indians , as Preacher had once put it , were notional critters . <p> Buck moved out , slowly . He would take his time , get accustomed to the country , and eyeball everything in sight . For if he made it out of Bury alive , he was going to need more than one back door and one hell of a good hiding place . <p> Buck wore gray pin-striped trousers tucked into soft calfskin boots . Black shirt . His hat was black , low-crowned , and wide-brimmed . His leather vest was black . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slicker were tied behind the saddle , over the saddlebags . A Henry repeating rifle rested in a boot , butt forward instead of the usual fashion of the butt facing back . He did not ride in the usual slump-shouldered manner of the old mountain men , but instead sat his saddle ramrod straight , cavalry fashion . Because of this , many who saw the handsome , cold-eyed young man believed him to be ex-cavalry . He let them think it , knowing that helped to further disguise his past . <p> He carried a two-shot derringer in his left boot , in his right boot a long-bladed , double-edged dagger-that knife in addition to the Bowie he wore on his gunbelt , behind his left-hand gun . <p> Buck was an expert with all the weapons he carried . The legend growing around the man stated there was no faster gun-hand in all the west . He was faster than the Texas gun Hardin ; even more steel-nerved than Wild bill ; meaner than Curly Bill ; when he was in the right , crueler than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ever lived . <p> The old mountain man , Preacher , who helped raise him from a lad , had taught him fistfighting and boxing and Indian wrestling . But even more importantly , Preacher had taught him how to win , teaching him that it do n't make a good gawd-damn how you win-just win . <p> The old mountain man had said , and the boy had remembered , " Long as you right , Smoke , it do n't make no difference how you win . Just be sure you in the right . " <p> And Lord God , how fast the young man was with those deadly .44s . <p> Buck gave Drifter his head , letting the horse pick his own way at his own pace , staying close to the timber , away from open places , always edging slightly south and west . He wanted to enter the mostly uncharted center of the Territory from the south . Just north of the Craters of the Moon , Buck would turn Drifter 's nose north until he hit the Big Lost River . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wild country in the Territory . He would then track the Big Lost for a time , then head more north than west until reaching the new town of Challis . There , he would resupply and head north , following the Salmon River for about thirty-five miles . Bury was located about midway between the Salmon and the town of Tendoy . <p> But if Buck had his way , the town of Bury would soon cease to exist . <p> It would be several more years before the toll road would be started from Challis , reaching to Bonanza , with a spur to Salmon . Only then would the big-scale silver mining at Bay Horse get underway . <p> But that was future . This was now . And Buck was not heading for Bury to pan for gold , search for silver , or start a ranch . And he really did n't care all that much if he died doing what he 'd set out to do-just so long as he got it done . The men now living and prospering in and around Bury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men who had killed his father ; raped , tortured , and murdered Buck 's wife , Nicole ; killed his baby son ; and killed his best friend and mentor , the old mountain man , Preacher . <p> And then they had done their cruel best to kill the man who now called himself Buck West . <p> Stratton , Potter , and Richards had thrown their best gun-hands at the young man . He had killed them all . <p> Thus far , Stratton , Potter , and Richards had failed to stop Buck . <p> Buck had no intention of failing . <p> Chapter Two Buck was being followed . He had yet to catch a glimpse of his pursuers , but he knew someone was tracking him ; knew it by that itchy feeling between his shoulder blades . Twice in as many days he had stopped and spent several hours checking his backtrail . But to no avail . Whoever or whatever it was coming along behind him was laying way back , several miles at least . And they were very good at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to have spotted them , and Preacher had taught the young man well . <p> Puzzled , Buck rode on , pushing himself and his horses , skirting the fast growing towns in the eastern part of the state , staying to the north of them . Because of the man , or men , tracking him , Buck changed his plans and direction . He rode seemingly aimlessly , first heading straight north , then cutting south into the Bridger Wilderness . He crossed into Idaho Territory and made camp on the north end of Grays Lake . He was running very low on supplies , but living off the land was second nature to Buck , and doing without was merely a part of staying alive in a yet wild and untamed land . <p> The person or persons following him stayed back , seemingly content to have the young man in sight , electing not to make an appearance-yet . <p> Midafternoon of his second day at Grays Lake , Buck watched Drifter 's ears prick up , the eyes growing cautious as the stallion lifted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A voice helloed the camp . <p> " If you 're friendly , come on in , " Buck called . " If you want trouble , I 'll give you all you can handle . " <p> Buck knew the grizzled old man slowly riding toward his small fire , but could not immediately put a name to him . The man-anywhere between sixty-five and a hundred and five-dismounted and helped himself to coffee and pan bread and venison . He ate slowly , his eyes appraising Buck without expression . Finally , he belched politely and wiped his hands on greasy buckskins . He poured another cup of coffee and settled back on the ground . <p> " Do n't talk none yet , " the old man said . " Jist listen . You be the pup Preacher taken under his wing some years back . Knowed it was you . Ante 's been upped some on your head , boy . Near-abouts thirty thousand dollars on you , now . You must have a hundred men after you . Hard men , boy . Most of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that good . Sooner ' er later , you 'll slip up , git tared , have to rest , then they 'll git you . " He paused to gnaw on another piece of pan bread . <p> " The point of all this is ... ? " Buck said . <p> " Tole you to hush up and listen . Jawin ' makes me hungry . ' Mong other things . Makes my mouth hurt too . You got anything to ease the pain ? " <p> " Pint in that pack right over there . " Buck jerked his head . <p> The old mountain man took two huge swallows of the rye , coughed , and returned to the fire . " Gawddamn farmers and such run us old boys toward the west . Trappin 's fair , but they ai n't no market to speak of . Ten of us got us a camp just south of Castle Peak , in the Sawtooth . Gittin ' plumb borin ' . We figured on headin ' north in about a week . " He lifted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na take our time . Ai n't no point in gettin ' in no lather . " He got to his feet and walked toward his horses . " Might see you up there , boy . Thanks for the grub . " <p> " What are you called ? " Buck asked . <p> " Tenneysee , " the old man said without looking back . He mounted up and slowly rode back in the direction he 'd come . <p> " You 're not any better lookin ' than the last time I saw you ! " Buck called to the old man 's back , grinning as he spoke . <p> " Ai n't supposed to be , " Tenneysee called . " Now git et and git gone . You got trouble on your backtrail . " <p> " Yeah , I know ! " Buck shouted . <p> " Worser'n Preacher ! " Tenneysee called . " Cai n't tell neither of you nuttin ' ! " <p> Then he was gone into the timber . <p> Fifteen minutes later , Buck had saddled Drifter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone , riding northwest . <p> He wondered how many men were trailing him . And how good they were . <p> He figured he would soon find out . <p> Staying below the crest of a hill , Buck ground-reined Drifter and scanned his backtrail . It was then he caught the first glimpse of those following him . Four riders , riding easy and seemingly confident . He removed a brass spyglass from his saddlebags and pulled it fully extended , sighting the riders in . He did not recognize any of them , but could see they were all heavily armed . Hardcases , every one of them . <p> Buck looked back over his shoulder , toward the west . He smiled at the sight . Blackfeet . And the way they were traveling , the gunhands and the warlike Blackfeet would soon come face to face . <p> The Blackfeet had not always hated the white man . Long before the Lewis and Clark expedition , the Blackfeet had been in contact with the French-Canadian trappers of the Hudson 's Bay Company . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1806 , when the Lewis and Clark expedition split up , Clark turning southward to explore the Yellowstone River , Lewis taking the Blackfoot Branch as the best route to the Missouri , Lewis had encountered a band of Blackfeet . No one knows who started the fight , or why , and the journals of Lewis do n't say , but the battle had a long-lasting effect . Since the Blackfeet were the most powerful and warlike tribe in the Northwest , their hatred following the battle closed both rivers to American travel . <p> Buck was puzzled why so many Blackfeet were in this part of the Territory , somewhat off their beaten path . He concluded , after looking them over through his spyglass , that they were a war party , and had been quite successful , judging from the scalps on their rifles and coup sticks and wound into their horses ' manes . <p> Buck smiled as the Blackfeet spotted the white men first . Within seconds , the Blackfeet had vanished , the war party splitting up , lying in silent wait to spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fun . He quickly mounted up and took off in the other direction . Blackfeet had a reputation for being downright testy at times . <p> And from the north , a pair of old eyes watched as Buck rode out . The eyes followed the young man until he was out of sight . <p> Buck heard the shots from the short battle as he continued to put more distance between himself and the Blackfeet . The old man waited almost an hour before leaving his hiding place . Leading a pack animal , he slowly rode after Buck . He was in no hurry , for he knew where Buck was going and what he was going to do . He just wanted to be there to help the young man out . <p> 1874 in most of Idaho Territory was no place for the fainthearted , the lazy , the coward , or the shirker.
