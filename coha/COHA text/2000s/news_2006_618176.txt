<p> He did it . Twice . <p> His voice low but unwavering , Barton Corbin admitted Friday in a Lawrenceville courtroom to killing his wife , Jennifer Corbin , and his dental school girlfriend , Dorothy " Dolly " Hearn . <p> The plea agreement , which came together after prosecutors recently connected Corbin to the murder weapon , ensures he will spend most of his life in prison . It confirms that Corbin is a man who ends his relationships with gunfire . <p> Corbin said nothing when he was allowed to speak to the victims ' families before he was sentenced . Instead , he stood stone-faced as relatives of the victims wiped away tears . <p> The courtroom was packed Friday with family and friends of Dolly Hearn and Jennifer Corbin , some wearing buttons of the two smiling women . <p> No one from Corbin 's family attended  --  not even his mother , who had been a fixture at earlier court hearings . <p> Gwinnett County Superior Court Judge Michael Clark allowed two relatives of victims to address Corbin after his admission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed Corbin coolly . <p> " God may forgive you , I never will . I just virtually hope you burn in hell , " Barber said . <p> He also said Barton 's and Jennifer 's two sons would be well cared for . Jennifer 's sister Heather Tierney has had temporary custody of the boys and plans to seek permanent custody in the coming weeks . <p> Carlton Hearn Jr. , brother of Dolly Hearn , told Corbin about the agony his family had endured as they waited 16 years for justice . <p> " Sixteen years of silence , 16 years of pain , " said Hearn . " Bart Corbin has disgraced his profession dentistry and has stolen from mankind . My family is in complete agreement with the sentence . " <p> Corbin , a Dacula dentist , 42 , was sentenced to life in prison for the 2004 Gwinnett murder of his wife , Jennifer Corbin , 33 , and life in prison for the 1990 Augusta murder of Dorothy " Dolly " Hearn , 27 . The sentences will run concurrently , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served . <p> Attorneys said Friday that Corbin would be eligible for parole in 14 years under Georgia parole guidelines . But Gwinnett prosecutor Danny Porter said , " He wo n't have a realistic chance at parole eligibility until 28 years . " <p> The plea deal came after three days of jury selection in the murder trial in Jennifer 's slaying . The death penalty was not being sought in this case . <p> Porter has said the case was not eligible for the death penalty because there were no aggravating circumstances in Corbin 's case . Corbin was scheduled to stand trial in Augusta in the Hearn death . If he had been found guilty after a trial in Gwinnett , he could have faced the death penalty in Augusta . <p> Corbin had maintained until Friday that both women had committed suicide and that it was a coincidence that the relationships ended in suspicious deaths . Corbin did n't speak in court or explain what led him to kill them . He and Jennifer were in the early stages of a divorce , and Dolly Hearn had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously consider a plea deal this week when prosecutors connected Corbin to the murder weapon , Porter said . <p> Defense attorney Bruce Harvey said the defense team was ready for trial and that they had expert witnesses lined up . <p> " That gun pretty much closed the circle of evidence in the case , " Harvey said . <p> In deciding to plead , Corbin mulled over the impact a long trial would have on his family , the possibility of his son , Dalton , having to testify against him , and embarrassing details about extramarital affairs , his attorneys said . <p> But Corbin may also have been haunted by the possibility of facing a death penalty trial in Augusta , prosecutors said . <p> Before Corbin 's guilty plea , prosecutors from Gwinnett and Augusta detailed the evidence that they were prepared to bring to trial . <p> Porter said he had a videotaped statement from Richard J. Wilson , a longtime friend of Corbin 's . Wilson , of Troy , Ala. , told authorities he gave Corbin the .38 handgun that turned out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Porter said Wilson explained how he gave Corbin the murder weapon . Porter said Wilson told authorities that Corbin claimed he needed the gun for protection and that he never mentioned harming his wife . <p> Porter said he does not plan to charge Wilson with any crime . <p> Wilson retained a Birmingham attorney before giving his statement , to make sure Gwinnett prosecutors would not charge him , Porter said . <p> Porter said he thinks Wilson realized that Barton Corbin had killed his wife once he learned of her death . But Porter said Wilson was afraid to come forward . <p> " Once Jennifer was found dead , he figured it out , " Porter said . " I think he figured if he kept his mouth shut and his head down , it would blow over . " <p> Cellphone records obtained by Gwinnett prosecutors show Barton Corbin was in Troy five days before his wife was found dead . Authorities said they had traced the .38 Smith &; Wesson handgun that killed Jennifer to Troy . In 2002 , Troy police ran a check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filed for divorce , then traveled to Troy the next day , Nov. 30 , 2004 , to get the gun . <p> The day after Corbin traveled to Troy , he returned home and got into an argument with Jennifer and took her cellphone . Jennifer had been having an online affair with a person who she believed was a man named Christopher . In November 2004 , she discovered that her online " lover " was instead a woman named Anita Hearn , unrelated to Dolly Hearn . <p> Porter described how on the night before Corbin shot his wife , he was having drinks with friends at two restaurants . Porter said that at some point that night the friend said Corbin was too drunk to drive . Porter said the friend took Corbin 's keys , but Corbin took another key out of his wallet and drove to his home alone about 2 a.m .

Then , on June 6 , 1990 , Corbin parked at her apartment , took his license plate off his car and entered her home . Corbin then shot Hearn and staged the crime scene to look like a suicide . <p> Craig said that two witnesses saw Corbin at Hearn 's apartment the day of the murder . <p> As prosecutors told the story Friday , Corbin stood solemnly . He only showed a flicker of emotion when his two sons were mentioned . Corbin dropped his head for a moment as Max Barber spoke of his two sons , Dalton , now 9 , and Dillon 7 . <p> After Friday 's hearing , Narda Barber , Jennifer 's mother , expressed relief that the ordeal seemed finally to be ending . She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proceedings . As her husband , Max , delivered the withering address to Corbin , Narda said she focused only on the words , which she said Max had not prepared in advance . <p> " He said it straight from his heart and it was a small token of our family 's sorrow , " Narda Barber said . " Justice is never going to return our daughter . " <p> Standing in front of the judge Friday , Corbin seemed like a shell of the man who boldly attended his wife Jennifer 's funeral six days after killing her . <p> But outside the courtroom prosecutors said they had taken a dangerous man off the street . <p> Craig , the Augusta district attorney , called Corbin a " sociopath " and said , " Reasonable people will never be able to understand the mind of a killer . " <p> Craig said he will send the parole board a letter when the double murderer is eligible for parole urging them to keep Corbin behind bars : <p> " I will say in no uncertain terms , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society again .
