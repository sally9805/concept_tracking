<p> WHEN Josh Fatoullah graduated from Great Neck North High a few years ago and went off to freshman year at Florida State , his parents were sure he was gone for good . " I said , ' He 'll never live here again , ' " recalled his father , Ron , a lawyer . Ron Fatoullah was 17 when his own father died of a heart attack , and this made him very emotional about Josh 's departure . <p> " It hit Ron very hard , " said his wife , Carol . <p> " I felt a chapter in my life was closing , " Mr. Fatoullah recalled . " Who knows how long I 'll live ? I thought Josh would come home and just visit here and there , but we 'd never have that bonding time again . I was devastated . " <p> Four months later , Josh called to say he was moving home . <p> Josh felt Florida State was n't for him . Too many parties , too many temptations . " It was hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything like it . Wednesday morning at 11:30 in mid-November , guys are saying , ' Let 's not go to class , let 's go to the pool this morning , they 've got 10 kegs . ' " As Josh says , " I was n't doing incredibly well grade-wise , partying and everything . " <p> In an instant , the Fatoullahs went from mourning a lost son to urging the boy to stay in Florida . " Kids have to give it a chance , " Mr. Fatoullah says . " It 's not unusual for a student to feel uncomfortable first year . I wanted him to stick it out . " <p> Josh says : " I was pretty determined to come home . They did n't really understand . " <p> Mr. Fatoullah had gone to college in Buffalo and felt that one of the best parts was living away . He could foresee problems having Josh home . " I know what I did at 21 , " said Mr. Fatoullah . " I would n't want my mother and father in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You miss your son when he goes away to college , and then , when he comes home , you remember why it was time for him to go away . The late hours . The girlfriends . The messy room . The mumbling . The car . The Fatoullahs have a younger son , Mike , who is 17 , and the two boys always need the extra car at the exact same second . As Josh says , " I did n't know Mike would be driving to the moon and back while I 'm waiting for the car . " <p> Josh , now 21 , returned home two and a half years ago . He enrolled in Baruch College in the city and has made good grades . He lived at home for six months , took an apartment with two roommates for a year , then moved home again last fall . He 's in his junior year and will live with his parents until January , when he plans to study in Spain . <p> " It 's worked out pretty well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved for the most part , " said Ms. Fatoullah . " Are there conflicts ? Definitely . Do we work them out ? Sometimes . " <p> Says Josh : " At first it was very convenient , everything right here , plenty of food . Then , after a while , it started getting on my nerves . " <p> Among the issues : <p> negotiations over girls " I wanted to have a girl over , kind of late , " Josh says . He gave his parents a " heads-up , " he says , " not to be walking around the house half dressed . <p> " Their attitude is , it 's their house . " <p> " He wanted to have someone here at 1 a.m. , " his mom says . " I told him I did n't want company upstairs at that hour , but he was welcome to use the basement or living room . He ended up getting annoyed and not having anyone over . We want him to feel free to come and go , but it 's our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Embarrassing parents Some evenings when the sons bring friends home , they find their dad asleep on the living-room couch in front of the big TV . " It 's kind of embarrassing , " Mike says . " I never know how my parents will react  --  will they be annoying ? " <p> " We 're working on this , " Ms. Fatoullah says . <p> " That 's my couch , " Mr. Fatoullah says . " It 's true I wind down in front of the big TV ; I fall asleep . " <p> Josh says that when he had his own apartment , and his roommates did embarrassing stuff , it did n't matter . " Roommates are n't someone you 're related to . If they do something stupid , it 's not a reflection on me , " Josh says . <p> " You did n't come from your roommates , " Mike says . <p> In short , if you bring a girlfriend to your apartment and your drunken roommate throws up on her , it 's not your fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works 16 hours , comes home and falls asleep on the couch  --  well , that 's a major statement on your genetic code . <p> The cleaning woman Ms. Fatoullah , who 's in public relations , has a cleaning woman on Friday mornings , which , according to Josh , is the exact wrong day . " Friday morning I do n't have classes , " he says . " Thursday 's a big party night . The one day I can sleep late , I get kicked out of my room . " <p> Ms. Fatoullah dismisses this charge outright : " I 've had a few cleaning women . Whatever day they came was never good . " <p> Messy bedrooms When the Fatoullahs visited Josh 's dorm and apartment , they were amazed . " Absolutely immaculate , " Mr. Fatoullah says . But Josh 's bedroom at home ? " Definitely not immaculate , " Josh says , though he can explain : " You live in a house 21 years , stuff builds up in your room . To clean it , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what to throw out . In an apartment , you start fresh . " <p> The Car The parents thought of buying a fourth car , but decided against it , since Mike will be going off to college in Boston in the fall . " We also wanted to instill teamwork , " the mom says . " I called a family meeting about the boys getting along . We 've had quite a few family meetings . " <p> " Very annoying , " Josh says . <p> " A huge inconvenience , " Mike says . <p> All that said , the parents have enjoyed having Josh , and , Josh admits , " they 're always pretty accommodating to me . " On Friday nights , they have a family dinner . " I do n't see my parents much during the week , " he says . " My dad comes back from work and I 'm going out for the night . It 's nice to catch up . " <p> " You notice we 're having better conversations , " Mr. Fatoullah says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't what went . " <p> " He 's more helpful , " Ms. Fatoullah says . " I ask him to walk the dog , I do n't get an argument . " <p> " What came back  --  a son who could communicate on a deeper level , " Mr. Fatoullah says . " He could talk about issues other than himself . " <p> The sons soon excuse themselves , but a few minutes later Mike returns to ask about the car . " Can I take yours ? " he asks his mother . <p> " I need it , " she says . " You talk to Josh ? " <p> " He needs it , so I guess I ca n't go out , " Mike says , clearly upset . <p> But minutes later , the parents overhear the two of them in the next room . " I need to do one more thing , " Josh says to Mike , " then I 'll give you a ride . " <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
