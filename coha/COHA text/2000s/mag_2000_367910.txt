For the past 15 years , Kathie Lee Gifford has been more than Regis Philbin 's co-host . She 's been a damn interesting spectator sport . There was the 1996 sweatshop scandal , of course , and husband Frank Gifford 's 1997 tryst with a flight attendant . Also , there were her remarkable skills as a broadcaster ; her combustible chemistry with Philbin ; their show 's unscripted , unpredictable first 20 min. ; and the sometimes palpable tension between her and Michael Gelman , executive producer of Live with Regis and Kathie Lee . This week Gifford , 46 , leaves it all behind . Who will replace her ? It has n't been decided . The more pressing question is , Why is she leaving ? And what will America do from 9 to 9:20 a.m. after she 's gone ? <P> TIME Sorry to hear you were laid off . <P> KATHIE LEE These things happen . Everybody in show business has spent time in the unemployment line . <P> TIME Where do you go from here ? <P> KATHIE LEE I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of mind that I 'm looking for . This past year has been thrilling to me on a creative basis , from Broadway Putting It Together to the album I just did Born for You . I want to spend more time being that fulfilled creatively . I also did an episode of Touched by an Angel about a woman who 's committing suicide . The angel Monica saves her life . Cody Gifford 's 10-year-old son immediately said , " Oh , rats . " He wanted me to jump . I said , " Cody , you 're not alone . A lot of people want me to jump . " <P> TIME Will you do a sitcom ? <P> KATHIE LEE I 'm talking to networks about sitcoms and dramas . I 'm talking to movie producers . <P> TIME But your current job takes only a few hours a day , and you make , like , $5 million a year . <P> KATHIE LEE No , it 's a lot more than that . Not a lot . It 's enough . If it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> TIME Who should take your place ? <P> KATHIE LEE Maybe only Joy Philbin could do it . She not only shares chemistry with Regis , but she has history with him . It 's such a fine line between how much to kiss his rear end and how much to kick it . When I kick his rear end , people know I love him . <P> TIME About the other men in your life  --  is Frank still in the doghouse ? <P> KATHIE LEE I 'm not gon na discuss this . It 's old history , and if I 'm over it , ca n't everybody else get over it ? <P> TIME And there 's Gelman . <P> KATHIE LEE I 've always prided myself on being able to work with anybody . The times that Gelman and I had tension were when I 've wanted somebody on the show and he 's not wanted them on . I should have the right to say , " I want Bozo the Clown . " <P> TIME What was your best day professionally these past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came on . She 'd been in Africa and was battling cancer , so she was exhausted . She walked on our set , and I thought , I 'm looking at the most beautiful human I 've ever seen . <P> TIME What was the worst day ? <P> KATHIE LEE When I 'd been accused of labor issues . That was devastating beyond belief . <P> TIME But since it brought so much attention to the sweatshop issue , was n't it ultimately a good thing ? <P> KATHIE LEE I 'd love to tell that story . That would be nice for a change . Within weeks we had passed antisweatshop legislation in Albany .
