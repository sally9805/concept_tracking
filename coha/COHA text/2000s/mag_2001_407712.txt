During the past decade , type 2 diabetes increased at an alarming rate in the United States , mirroring an equally dramatic rise of a major risk factor  --  obesity . <p> Expanding waistlines and shrinking activity levels are giving rise to a major public-health crisis in the United States  --  a growing epidemic of type 2 diabetes . Last September the CDC released a report showing that diabetes rose 33 percent in the American adult population between 1990 and 1998 for every category men , women , and all races and ethnic groups . The most common form of diabetes , which accounts or over 90 percent of cases , is type 2 diabetes , once thought to affect primarily adults who are overweight and over the age of ' 45 . But the disease is emerging at an unprecedented rate in younger age groups , including preteen and adolescent youth . Health experts suggest that the dramatic rise in type 2 diabetes among all age groups parallels the sharp increase in obesity in the United States . According to the CDC. obesity among adults increased by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other ' factors do play roles in type 2 diabetes , fast food . television , and computer and video games coupled with cutbacks in exercise , physical education , and after-school activities  --  all combine to put on the pounds , leading to obesity and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes . <p> That 's the bad news . The good news is that the complications of type 2 are highly preventable . Losing weight and adding exercise to your life may save you a lifetime of health complications associated with the disease , including blindness. kidney failure , heart attacks , stroke , med amputations . <p> The Post spoke with Dr. C. Ronald Kahn , president of the Joslin Diabetes Center , a leading diabetes research and treatment center affiliated with the Harvard Medical School , about the public health problem and measures that you can take to prevent the disease . <p> Q : Recent statistics from the CDC suggest that the number of people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the United States increased by one third between 1990 and 1998 . Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A : Yes . In fact , there was a follow up to the study reported to the CDC in which researchers went further and looked at what happened in 1999 . The authors of the study , published in Diabetes Care magazine , found that in 1999 , incidence increased another 6 percent . This most recent addition to their analysis suggested that the situation was even worse . <p> Q : How many people presently have type 2 diabetes , and how many are undiagnosed ? <p> A : The number of people with diabetes in the United States is estimated to be around 16 million . I actually believe that this is an underestimate based on these two recent surveys because it was a more conservative estimate of the prevalence . Taking into account these two recent surveys counting diagnosed and undiagnosed cases , the number of diabetes cases probably approaches 20 million . The surveys have also shown that type 2 diabetes  --  the more common form of diabetes accounting for about 90-plus percent of people  --  is occurring in much younger age groups . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ termed an epidemic of diabetes in the United States and around the world ? Does " epidemic " accurately describe what we are facing with diabetes in the world today ? <p> A : I think that it is an appropriate use of the word . Normally , we think of epidemics of infectious disease , but I think that we are , in fact , experiencing an epidemic of diabetes . We are talking about a disease that affects practically 7 percent of the entire United States population . The incidence of diabetes is going up at a time when many other diseases that we have treatments for are going down in their impact . Diabetes ' impact is actually going up , so we have more people getting the disease and getting it at a younger age . And even though we have treatments for diabetes , many of the long-term complications are becoming increasing problems . <p> Q : What do you think has caused this explosion in the incidence of diabetes ? <p> A : Let me divide this into two parts . Since most diabetes is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obesity and lifestyle factors such as diet and lack of exercise , most people would say that this increase is simply a reflection of the fact that , as a group , Americans are getting heavier and less active . In fact , the same study that showed this increased prevalence from 1990 to 1998 of 33 percent also discussed increasing body weight during this period of time . During these years , the average body weight for a man or a woman over age 18 went up one pound per year for the eight-year period of the study . Most people believe that a major contributing factor would be the increase in body weight and decrease in activity . <p> We do n't know for sure whether obesity is the only factor . It is one that we can easily identify , but if there are other factors that we are presently not aware of , we should definitely look for them . <p> Another fact worth pointing out , although not as dramatic , is that over the last 50 years , the prevalence of type 1 diabetes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also gone up . Type 1 diabetes is not related to body weight or activity . We ca n't explain the type 1 increase at all . Lifestyle and body weight can account for the rise in the incidence of type 2 diabetes , but there may be other important factors we should consider . <p> Q : The term " obese " is rather loosely defined in many reports . What is the definition of obese ? When a person is termed " obese , " how much over ideal body weight is he or she ? <p> A : Several different definitions are used . In the most precise studies , obesity is usually defined in terms of what is called the " body mass index " or BMI , which is the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared . It 's a funny number that goes from about 18 to approximately 50 . The lower the number , the leaner you are ; the higher the number , the fatter you are . ' <p> For the purposes of most studies , people define @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obese and a body mass index of 27 to 30 as being overweight . In more conventional terms , anybody more than 20 percent of their ideal body weight would be obese . People between 10 and 20 percent over their ideal body weight would be considered overweight . <p> The reason that these numbers have been picked is because when you are more than 20 percent above ideal body weight or more than a BMI of 30 , one can show that you are definitely at increased risk for developing some obesity related problems . These problems might include diabetes , abnormal elevation of blood lipids , increased atherosclerosis , increased hypertension , and earlier average death . <p> All of these diseases correlate with being at least 20 percent above ideal body weight . At that point , we know that it is a definite risk . It is probably true if we could measure it accurately that there is even a risk to being even a little bit overweight , but it is hard to measure when less than that . <p> Q : In practical terms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " how many pounds are we talking about ? <p> A : Twenty percent over your ideal body weight may mean , for example , that if your ideal body weight is 150 pounds , you weigh 180 pounds . The number would obviously depend on body size . But that is a fairly significant amount of weight . On the other hand , there are many people who will carry that extra weight and do not think that it is a problem for them . <p> Q : The CDC study showed a disturbing rise in diabetes in the younger population . One physician who has worked with adult-onset diabetes for many years told us that he had never seen a case of adult-onset or type 2 diabetes in juveniles in all his years of practice until about ten years ago . A recent report suggested that the percentage of obese youth has doubled , and the incidence of type 2 diabetes-once very rare among teen and preteens  --  is escalating dramatically . Do you see this in your clinic at Joslin in Boston , and what in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : We have definitely seen it . There was a time when you would virtually never see type 2 diabetes in clinics that take care of children . Now , for example , at Children 's Hospital in Boston , I would estimate that between 20 and 25 percent of the children seen actually has type 2 diabetes . If you go to an inner city with a large percentage of minority population represented , that number might go up even higher . <p> Several published studies from the University of Cincinnati Hospital and hospitals in Pennsylvania indicate that the number actually exceeds 30 and 35 percent , so type 2 diabetes is definitely being seen much more frequently in various clinical settings . <p> Much of the increased incidence is ascribed to the fact that the children come from families with type 2 diabetes and , therefore , probably carry the genes that put one at risk for type 2 diabetes . <p> But what is also happening at a younger and younger age is a more sedentary lifestyle , higher caloric intake , and more obesity , so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . <p> People with the genetic predisposition for type 2 diabetes can become clinically apparent by any one of several things that add to what we call insulin resistance . Normally , insulin acts on liver , muscle , and fat to control blood glucose . The person with type 2 diabetes actually makes insulin pretty normally , but their tissues do n't respond to it . Part of this resistance is genetically programmed , but in addition to what is genetically programmed , people may acquire different forms of insulin resistance  --  the most common being obesity . Other factors that cause insulin resistance are pregnancy and various kinds of physical stress , such as being in an automobile accident , having a severe burn , or being on steroids . <p> Q : One theory holds that insulin resistance is the body 's way of signaling that a person needs to lose weight  --  in other words , something from our evolutionary past . <p> A : The frequently discussed notion is derived from what is sometimes called " the thrifty gene hypothesis . " Certain body hormones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you will , to retain storage of fat may have had evolutionary advantage when food was not widely available , and you had to go through periods of food deprivation . In fact , in experimental animals that carry some of the obesity genes , they can when subjected to periods of starvation survive longer , even when they do n't start out fatter ; so there does seem to be something to this thrifty genotype . <p> We still do n't know for sure , however , if that is the only reason some of these pathways have evolved . <p> Q : When children experience early onset of type 2 diabetes , does this raise their risk for early onset of diabetic complications , such as heart disease , vascular problems , blindness , and stroke ? <p> A : All long-term complications of diabetes are dependent primarily on two major and a few minor factors . The two major factors are the degree of control , and the duration , of the diabetes . But there are also minor factors that include genetics and the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example  --  that may also affect significantly the rate of development of complications . <p> Duration of disease , however , is definitely one of the key variables . As we see more type 2 diabetes in younger age groups , this should sound a very real alarm to both the individual and society as a whole that many of the people developing type 2 diabetes at younger ages will be exposed to this abnormal metabolic state for longer periods . Once these patients reach middle age and beyond , the situation will change dramatically . People used to develop type 2 diabetes at age 70 , and since it often takes 15 or 20 years for complications to develop , many of them did n't even live 15 or 20 additional years , so they did n't develop the complications . Take the same situation , for example , in someone 35 years old developing type 2 diabetes ; they will have had 20 years of disease and still only be 55 years old . They will have that period plus another 20 years or more to still express complications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the dynamics of the disease , either through prevention or by dramatically reducing the impact of disease on the likelihood of developing complications , we will see many long-term medical problems from diabetes in general , but from type 2 diabetes specifically , that will become more of a problem . <p> Q : Will this impact the mortality rate of the disease ? <p> A : Absolutely . In fact , a couple of years ago , I chaired a committee called the Diabetes Research Working Group that wrote a report for Congress . The group of scientists , lay people , and physicians surveyed the problem of diabetes and current research , and issued a proposal to Congress about what should be done to improve diabetes research in the United States . <p> Our review included looking at the impact of diabetes on the population . One of the things that we observed , which I think had not been noted even though the data were present , is that the age-adjusted mortality rate for diabetes has actually gone up about 30 percent in the last decade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , stroke or cardiovascular disease has gone down about 20 percent . We are going in the wrong direction with diabetes . <p> Q : Is poor nutrition , then , the culprit ? And how can parents , for example , help combat this trend ? <p> A : It is a case of poor nutrition , but in this case , poor nutrition is over nutrition . In our society , almost everyone has access to food . And often people with less economic means have access to even higher caloric foods than people with more economic means . Many people are eating high-calorie , high-fat diets  --  not that fat per se is harmful , but it is harmful in the sense that it is the source of many of the calories . This sets up a situation where , in fact , nutrition is key . And the key to nutrition is reflected in what you see on the scale . <p> I tell my patients on diets that it really does n't make any difference how much you think that you are eating . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scale is n't going down , whatever you are eating is more than you should if you want to lose weight . <p> Q : In a recent statement , you referred to such environmental factors as the " diabetes toxins " of modern society . What are the diabetes toxins ? <p> A : This is a little bit of a pet peeve of mine , and I guess it is a little bit hard to prove . When talking about the increase in diabetes , we always assume that everything is related to diet and lack of exercise . When I say diet , I usually mean body weight . What I encouraged in the report to Congress is that we certainly must be attentive to diet and exercise , but we should be sure that we are not missing other factors . We do n't know for sure if other environmental toxins can cause diabetes . Some toxins can acutely cause diabetes if accidentally ingested , such as certain types of rat poison . But as a research community , we want to be sure that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is something else that we need to be aware of . We do n't actually have specific examples as yet . <p> There are some things that can be fairly subtle in the case of diabetes , and I will give you an example that is relevant for type 1 diabetes . <p> In the old days when women got rubella , or German measles , during pregnancy , children could be born with a syndrome of congenital rubella  --  the rubella virus would cross across the placenta and infect the unborn child-and they would be born with a disease . It is a terrible problem that causes neurological problems , blindness , and a number of other things . But 25 percent of those children developed type 1 diabetes usually within the first decade or two of life or before the age of 21 . This example points out that a toxin to which children were exposed in utero set up the possibility of developing childhood diabetes later in a way that we would n't necessarily have predicted off the top of our heads . <p> The same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will give you an example for type 2 that is now quite well documented , yet we do not understand it . We now know that children of low birth weight have a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes as adults . I am not talking about premature babies ; I am talking about full-term babies of low birth weight . We can actually reproduce this finding in animals . If you , for example , restrict the food of a pregnant mouse or rat such that the pups are born smaller than normal , those pups begin to develop diabetes at a higher percentage than normal . In this case , intrauterine nutrition  --  a deficiency of something-sets the stage for subsequent development of diabetes . <p> Q : Several years ago , researchers linked low birth weight to later obesity . <p> A : In some cases , low birth weight is linked to increased obesity . But , for example , in the mouse and rat models , you can get the diabetes even without having any difference in body weight . I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been that suggestion . <p> Q : I understand that diabetes is multifactorial , but would it be beneficial for people to accept the fact that obesity and inactivity play major roles in the development and prevention of type 2 diabetes ? <p> A : Absolutely . It is very important that people are aware of these factors . There is a huge national , multicenter , ongoing study on the prevention of type 2 diabetes called the Diabetes Prevention Program . One of the major aims of that study focuses on lifestyle changes  --  diet and aerobic exercise . Although the results of that study wo n't be known for another year , I would bet a dollar to a nickel that this study will show that diet and exercise make a huge difference in the development of diabetes . <p> Q : Have scientists discovered which comes first in type 2 diabetics  --  the obesity or diabetes ? It sounds similar to the old question of which comes first , the chicken or the egg . <p> A : I think , in this instance , it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predisposes diabetes . People with diabetes are not necessarily predisposed to becoming obese per se , but rather the other way around . I am not sure which you would label the chicken , but in this case the causal factor that predisposes to diabetes is the obesity . We do n't know for sure whether genes that predispose one to diabetes could also be genes that predispose individuals to obesity  --  it could be the same genes . <p> Q : Do you think that our so-called " couch potato culture " is to blame ? <p> A : It is a big factor , yes . But it goes beyond the couch potato . I am struck myself by the fact of how rarely our friends ' kids go anywhere without being driven . There are many justifications that I think are only partially real , such as " I am worried about them walking " and this and that . I live in a perfectly safe area in a suburb of Boston , as do most people whose kids could perfectly well walk or ride their bicycles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's actually not just the obvious things that we do  --  sitting in front of a television eating a bag of potato chips  --  that adds to obesity . It is actually some of the more subtle incidents where many people that you and I know will take their kids over to play with a friend who lives two blocks away . They will not walk anywhere . All of this inactivity leads to more obesity in the population . <p> Q : The public health message is out there . Are people just not listening or are they confused ? <p> A : People hear the message but do n't believe it . There is a sense that " I 'm OK , I watch what I eat and play tennis once a week , and take care of myself . " Many people do n't realize how insidious these health problems are . If you look around , you can see how common obesity and inactivity are and that they are leading to many problems . <p> Q : Americans spent billions of dollars last year on dietary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as the high-protein diet , healthy for diabetics wanting to lose weight ? <p> A : Generally , the best diets for long-term weight loss are balanced diets . When people go on one of these diets that stresses the presence or absence of some food group , they will lose weight acutely over a short period of time . Many people go on high-fat , low-fat , high-protein , low-protein diets and swear by the diets . For long-term weight loss , balanced diets coupled with activity have been shown to be most effective . If you look at studies of people who kept their weight off for several years or more , almost all of the people have coupled their diet with an exercise program . <p> Q : What about a low-fat diet ? <p> A : Low fat is the one of the easiest ways to take calories out of your diet , because fat is the most calorically dense part of the diet . If you decide to cut out all or most of the fat in the diet and leave yourself with mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of volume and not take in many more calories , because protein and carbohydrate are four calories per gram , while fat is nine per gram . This means that for every gram or ounce of food that you eat , fat gives you more than twice as many calories as carbohydrate or protein . But many people find that if you actually look at experience , it turns out that people on low-carbohydrate , high-fat diets also can lose weight very well for a different reason . When you only eat fat , your body develops what are called ketone bodies that cause a natural suppression of appetite . On a high-fat diet  --  even though you are eating something with more calories , you tend to lose your appetite , and that helps you eat less . <p> Each of these diets can work for people . What I recommend is that if one works for them , that 's fine for a time to begin to lose weight . But in the long run , they have to work to find a more balanced diet if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with activity . <p> Leave the couch-potato lifestyle behind . " Get up , get out , and get active " is the message from health professionals . Maintaining ideal body weight and exercising regularly lowers the risk of developing type 2 diabetes . <p> Health experts advise people with diabetes to check their feet daily for cuts , bruises , blisters , and swelling . Mirrors help diabetics see the bottoms of their feet . <p> Working in a pastry shop is an occupational hazard for Norman Rockwell 's baker . Imagine putting the creator of all these delicious cakes on a diet that allows him only a dozen baby carrots for lunch . <p> By Patrick Perry <p>
