holiday entertaining decorate Headnote Friends and loved ones celebrate the season in a gracious New Jersey home Photograph // Around the holidays , you wo n't find fake tinsel or spray-on snow in the Montclair , New Jersey , home of Dede and Alfred Mays . Instead of buying commercial decorations , this family has fun with environmentally friendly adornments that are naturally beautiful and have a second life as bird food or compost . Aside from strings of white lights , which add that seasonal sparkle , their 1912 English Tudor-style house is decked out with pomegranates and green apples , small bundles of cinnamon sticks tied with raffia or gold bows , pine-cone clusters and a cowrie-shell garland on the tree . Using natural ornaments saves Dede the annual task some people find tedious-taking down and packing the decorations . Here everything goes out with the tree , except the lights and the cowrie-shell garland , which are easily rolled up . What 's more , everyone can take part in creating them , including the Mayses ' 7-year-old grandniece , Mina ( at right ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dress up a plain twig wreath ( available at craft-store chains like Jo-Ann Fabrics and Crafts and Michaels ) or pine garland you buy by the yard at florists and Christmas-tree stands . Wire pine cones onto wreaths and evergreen separately or in clusters . Kumquats , green and miniature lady apples , oranges , pomegranates and artichokes can also be attached in clusters to add color . To attach them , use wooden skewers pressed into the fruit so they make a stem ( with the fruit as the flower ) , then place the stem into the greenery as you would any flower , working it between the wires and branches of the swags ( garland draped on stairs or fireplaces ) or wreath so it stays in place . Trim excess stem with scissors or pruning shears . Try to keep the heaviest fruit pointing upward , and make sure most of the skewer is submerged in the fruit . Otherwise , gravity and natural juices will cause the fruit to slip off the stems . COWRIE-SHELL GARLAND Cowrie shells , which add a nice cultural flavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garlands , you 'll need the shells , some shiny cord and a hot-glue gun . ( This is an activity for older kids or adults . ) Squeeze some hot glue into the crevice of the shell and lay the cord in it . Wait two seconds for it to bond , then repeat with more shells , leaving about a half inch of space between them so the shiny cord shows , too . ORNAMENTS Even kids can make ornaments from pomegranates and apples . The fruit can be heavy , so choose small ones and pick a variety of Christmas tree with sturdy branches such as Fraser fir or spruce . If the apples have stems , tie ribbon tightly onto them , then tie the fruit directly to the tree . For pomegranates and stemless apples , buy brass cup hooks or eye hooks with the longest screw ends you can find ( available at most hardware stores ) . Hold the hooks by the loop ends ( or eyes ) , and screw firmly into the tops of the fruit until the ends are completely buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree with raffia or ribbon . Photograph // CINNAMON-STICK CLUSTERS Cinnamon sticks are found at grocery and health-food stores and , often during Christmas , at country gift shops . Just tie a few together with raffia or ribbon , and hang on the tree or wire onto garlands and wreaths . ( Tip : Keep the clusters in proportion to your tree by using bunches of longer sticks toward the bottom and shorter ones as you go up . ) ARRANGEMENTS The Mayses also like to go au naturel with their flower arrangements . But with such a big house , that can get expensive . So to create most of her arrangements , Dede takes various containers to her supermarket , where the produce manager or the person in charge of assembling catering platters is happy to make luscious compositions of fruit and evergreens for an affordable fee . " It 's much more reasonable than going to the florist for everything , " she says . The dining room centerpiece is the only really big production . Harlem floral designer Marc Wilson used one of Dede 's china @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ berries , pomegranates and three shades of red roses ( from dark and deep to light and bright ) for a luxurious effect . <p>
