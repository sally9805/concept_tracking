// Have you ever seen a brown pelican ? If you have , you were probably tempted to laugh out loud . A bird that looks so absurd is hard to take seriously . A pelican that is resting on top of a dock piling , its head tucked down into its shoulders , looks almost like a big hairy football . When it stands up , things do n't get much better . The body seems much too big for the elegant neck and small skull . The heavy bill seems to force the bird to look down all the time . But if a resting pelican looks like a piece of sporting equipment , and a standing pelican looks lopsided , you should see one try to walk ! The stubby legs and big webbed feet cause an ungainly waddle that would make any bird say , " These feet were n't made for walking . " And they were n't . They were made for paddling . In fact , all the features that make the pelican look so comical are the same ones that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unlike most other swimming birds , pelicans have webbing on all four toes of both feet . There 's a good reason for this . A bird that is crazy enough to dive for fish just beyond the breakers had better be able to paddle well to stay out of trouble . // What about that massive body ? There 's no denying that it is something only another pelican could love . But if you remember that a resting pelican has wings that span up to seven feet folded on its back , you 'll realize that under all that wing mass is a fairly normal-looking body ( for a bird , at least ) . Flying is what this bird is about-not winning a beauty contest . When a pelican takes to the air on those wings , the comedy is over and the adventure begins . Riding wind currents over the dune tops , a line of pelicans flies with the precision of the Blue Angels Navy jets . And the pelican 's low glide over the ocean has the grace of a skater . The bird skims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its belly and wingtips from getting wet . If you want to see aerobatics , watch when a hungry pelican spots a fish . He 'll fly as high as thirty feet , then , with wings tucked back , dive with a crash and a splash into the water . You can see why some experts believe the pelican actually stuns the fish when the force of that eight-pound body hits from the height of a three-story building . Let 's not forget the pelican 's most distinguishing feature : its pouch . Pelicans in cartoons and comics use their pouches as tote bags . In reality , the pouch is not for carrying . Instead , it is an adaptation that makes the pelican an exceptional fisherman . After the pelican dives into the water , it opens its bill and uses the stretchy pouch as a net to capture its dinner . When it bobs to the surface with the pouch full , the water is drained out , and the pelican gulps down the catch . It 's a good thing the pelican is such a skilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When their clutch of three eggs hatches , it will take the pelican parents about 125 pounds of fish to get the young birds through the two-and-a-half-month nesting period . That 's more than ten pounds of fish every week ! After the nesting period , the parents abandon the juveniles . They must master the diving skills needed to feed themselves . Growing up is n't easy for a pelican . Overall , only one-third of the new chicks each year will survive . If a pelican can learn the lessons necessary to survive , it has the chance to live up to thirty years . Then the adult can proudly waddle to a perch , rest his bill on his chest , and join the ranks of all those clumsy but clever pelicans before him . <p>
