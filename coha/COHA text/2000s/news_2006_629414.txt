<p> YOU do n't have to go to New York to hear great show tunes and experience a full-scale musical revue of Broadway 's most memorable moments . <p> Area high school theater not only offers students an opportunity to discover their inner artist , it offers the community a chance to sit in a darkened auditorium and be carried away to far away places and back through time by a story that unfolds on the stage . <p> From a swashbuckling adventure set during the French Revolution , to a tale of love and prejudice during World War II , local thespians have been hard at work behind the scenes to make the magic happen . <p> In the coming weeks , the Memorial/Spring Branch Neighborhood News section will profile some of the actors and productions that are waiting in the wings . <p> Following is a sampling : <p> Houston Christian <p> More than 68 students at Houston Christian High School will trod the boards at the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts for a three-day run of " South Pacific " . <p> The Rodgers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall . <p> But director and choreographer Cathy Doxtater of Katy said if you include the stage crew and orchestra members , " it brings the number to 125 ; almost one-third of our student body , half of whom are new to the stage . <p> Doxtater , who directed many of the school 's previous productions , including " Guys &; Dolls " , " Crazy for You " and " Singin ' in the Rain " , said she 's enjoyed " watching the show come together , and seeing the growth of the whole company as a family , with a unified purpose . " <p> The production serves as the school 's first ever entry in the annual Tommy Tune Awards , a program developed by Theatre Under the Stars to honor musical theatre excellence at the high school level . <p> The awards are presented at the end of the academic year . <p> " We 're somewhat like a dark horse in a sense , and I think that is favorable for us , " said senior Ryan Horton , who plays war-time entrepreneur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't really intimidate me because I enjoy competition , and since this is our first year to compete in Tommy Tune , no other schools are expecting a whole lot from us . " <p> Horton said the cast should not be underestimated . <p> " We have a lot of talent and experience as a company and have taken a lot of pride in our prior shows , " the Cy-Fair resident said . <p> " We feel ready as a whole to compete for some awards . " <p> Ryan Mann , a senior and Cinco Ranch resident , makes his theatrical debut as Cmdr. William Harbison . <p> Mann said he is thrilled to be a part of the production that features " amazing dance numbers that will blow the roof of the building . " <p> Based on James A. Michener 's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel , " Tales of the South Pacific , " the story takes place on a U.S. Naval base in the South Pacific during World War II . <p> The plot mixes romance in a South Seas paradise with the realities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most enduring melodies , including " Wash That Man Right Outta My Hair , " Some Enchanted Evening " and " There is Nothin ' Like a Dame " , Horton 's favorite . <p> " I really enjoy ( that song ) because it incorporates almost all of the guys in the show , " Horton said . <p> " When we all start singing together , it sounds really strong and awesome . " <p> A relative newcomer to singing , Horton credits Karen Klasen , co-producer and music director who teaches Bible classes at the school , for helping him prepare for the role . <p> " I started with ( Klasen ) , who also is the accompanist for the choir , and she helped me to gain a lot of confidence , " Horton said . <p> " I do n't think I will have a problem getting up in front of a live audience . " <p> That extra confidence comes in handy , he said , when he has to don a grass skirt , wig and a coconut shell bra , which serves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " At first I was a little hesitant , but then I just put all of that aside , and just started to enjoy it , " Horton said . <p> Ashley Mitchell , who plays Navy WAVE officer and " cockeyed optimist " Nellie Forbush , said slipping into the role felt natural . <p> " I can identify with the silly spirited , lively nature that Nellie exhibits , " said Mitchell , a junior who lives in Spring Valley . <p> " The most difficult part is juggling the long hours of rehearsal , my other extra curricular activities and maintaining my grades , " she said . <p> Mitchell , a varsity cheerleader and a member of the school 's choir , appeared in the school 's productions of " Singin ' in the Rain " and " The Diviners " , as well as several musicals at The Country Playhouse , including " Fame , " Grease , " Oliver Twist " and " The Wiz . " <p> This is the first time she will compete for a Tommy Tune nomination . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tommy Tune Awards for the first time , " she said . <p> " Of course , a few extra butterflies in the pit of my stomach will be attributed to the fact that there may be judges in the audience , but when the lights come on , its show time . " <p> Her cast mate said Mitchell has no reason to be nervous . <p> " Ashley is reason enough to come to the show , " Horton said . <p> " She fits into her part perfectly , and when she sings your ears perk up and you find yourself whispering , wow . ' " <p> Spring Woods <p> Thespians at Spring Woods High School are involved in a love triangle , on stage , that is in " The Scarlet Pimpernel " . <p> The play , which will be performed Jan. 19-28 at the Spring Woods High School Auditorium , 2045 Gessner , is " a love triangle full of deceit , secrets , passion and determination , " said senior Christina Stroup , who plays Marguerite in the production . <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The plot revolves around a British aristocrat , Sir Percy Blakeney , who is upset with the Revolution in France . <p> He forms a band of men to help him attempt to bring an end to the violence and goes undercover as The Scarlet Pimpernel . <p> Stroup portrays Marguerite , one of the great actresses in France who is married to Sir Percy . The Spring Valley resident said it was a role with which she could identify and thinks the audience will , too . <p> " She 's just so full of joy and life . I love the story because she 's not happy the entire time , she goes through trials and tribulations , she 's such a complex character . She 's real , " said Stroup , who has been nominated for a total of two Tommy Tune awards and won in 2005 for her role as Mayzie La Bird in " Seussical the Musical " . <p> " Everyone has had their heart broken and everyone has made mistakes and in this production you see this woman fall flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity . " <p> Senior Will Luton , who portrays Percy , said his character challenged him a way others he has taken on have not . <p> " Percy is absolutely the most challenging character I have ever played , " said Luton , who has appeared in the school 's productions of " Les Miserables " , " Camelot and The Pirates of Penzance , " among others . <p> " I find conflict in characters fascinating and Percy truly has complex issues to work through , " he said . <p> Luton also had to learn to sword fight for his role for a scene between Percy and his nemesis , Chauvelin , played by Trent Brocato of Spring Branch . <p> " My favorite scene is the final duel between Percy and Chauvelin , " said Luton , who lives in Spring Shadows . <p> " The sword fighting is great fun and it 's been an educational experience learning the history behind dueling and learning to handle the swords . " <p> Brocato said he and Luton will have put in more than 25 hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most exciting thing I 've done on stage in all of high school , " Brocato said . <p> Stroup said the duel is among her favorite scenes of the play , too , because it brings to the surface all the angst , anger , hatred , rivalry and passion within the characters . <p> " It 's so intense . You see the raw emotions between Percy , Chauvelin and Marguerite , " she said . <p> " It 's definitely amazing . " <p> Brocato said he , too , enjoyed going toe-to-toe with Luton 's character , but said his favorite scene is one that involves the guillotine and allows him to " show the darker side of the character . It is one of the most dynamic numbers is the show , " said Brocato , who lives in Spring Branch . <p> Stroup said all the sword play and threat of the guillotine hanging over the characters ' heads should not lead theatergoers to believe this is a dark drama . <p> " The music is absolutely gorgeous and the play itself is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their seats , wondering what 's going to happen next , " she said . <p> Both Stroup and Luton were chosen to attend the 2005-2006 Houston Grand Opera High School Voice Studio . <p> Luton said the audience will be carried away by the music and the play 's plot . <p> " The Scarlet Pimpernel " has the depth and complexity of " Les Miserables " and the charming humor of " Pirates of Penzance , " creating an interesting combination of lighthearted humor with true action-packed adventure .
