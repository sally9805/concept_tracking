There 's more than one reason to watch football on TV . Just ask Michael Lasseter , the fan whose Nov. 16 dash through Atlanta 's Hartsfield International Airport  --  reportedly to retrieve a video camera and still catch his flight to make a game  --  caused the airport to be shut down for three hours . Lasseter 's sprint into a secured area has already earned him a criminal charge of disorderly conduct . Now it looks as if the civil courts will get a piece of the scurrying banker too . AirTran Airways , which says it lost $1 million when air traffic across the East was disrupted , is suing Lasseter for $100,000 . Delta Airlines , which has not followed suit  --  yet  --  claims to have lost up to $8 million . Lasseter , whose attorney calls AirTran 's suit " irresponsible , " says he was only dashing to the gate to retrieve his six-year-old son , whom he had left with a relative . Next time maybe he 'll just drive . <P>  --  By Amy Bonesteel/Atlanta     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
