1 Mariah " Hallelujah , " Mariah Moon said as the endless line of cars began moving forward . Twenty feet away , the Monterey exit shimmered like a desert mirage . She flipped on her blinker and waited impatiently to turn into traffic , brave the tunnel , and make her way to Lighthouse Avenue , where her mother was no doubt already preparing for the lunch crowd . Her grandmother , bless her heart for trying , was either filling saltshakers or replacing sugar packets , stopping to rest when her legs ached . If the cafe was slow , she might be saying novenas for Simon , the gay cook she was certain she could get to defect to the other side . To Gammy , success hinged on bolstering his spiritual life . God and beauty products were what she believed in , which was why creams and abandoned potions cluttered the upstairs apartment . She wanted to turn back the clock , not just on her face but on the varicose veins that plagued her legs as well . To say it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover it . Traffic stopped again . Mariah rested her forehead on the steering wheel and sighed . Highway One , the two-lane scenic byway on California 's Monterey coast , was two lanes too narrow to accommodate the tourists and commuters . A personcould waste a whole morning here , breathing exhaust fumes and getting exposed to God knows what . And time was money . From now on every tick of the clock would remind her of that . This morning at six forty-five she had awakened as a thirty-three-year-old term assistant professor of sociology about to start the fall quarter . She had her master 's , and fully intended to finish her doctoral dissertation , as soon as a chunk of time came her way  --  coinciding with a blue moon , or a four-leaf clover , or a flying pig . By ten-fifteen am she was another unemployment statistic due to budget cuts . Her checking account was in the dismally low three figures . Of course it was . All summer she waitressed at her mother 's cafe and lived on tips . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then this morning the dean had called her in and explained that the term post she 'd held for eight years was being phased out . Michael Howarth , Ph.D. , freshly graduated from the University of Louisiana , would now cover her classes . He was twenty-eight years old and had already published a book . After eight years of promises that her job would be made permanent as soon as they got more funding , Mariah wanted to call Michael up and tell him not to get too cozy , not to hang any pictures on the walls until he got tenure . If Mariah were to make the monthly car payment on the Subaru , the condo she and her daughter , Lindsay , rented would have to go . She could COBRA their insurance benefits  --  that is , if she could find a way to pay for them . At the heart of her worries was Lindsay 's tuition for Country Day Academy for Girls . Her twelve-year-old daughter 's I.Q. tested at 175 . That kind of intelligence was as much a burden as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her daughter 's intelligence to flourish , meaning public school was not an option . The stress would be traumatic , and such a drastic change had the potential to seal Lindsay 's fate as the too-smart geek girl to be avoided at all costs . Mariah knew that popularity was based on nothing more than the callow whim of youth . Other twelve-year-olds went to the movies , played soccer , slathered on fruit-scented lip gloss , and begged for trendy clothes . Not her daughter . Lindsay lived , breathed , and ate science . Quantum theory science . Bioethics science . Science fiction . Scientific essays with words longer than most sentences . The kinds of science a normal person could go a whole life without understanding and get along just fine . The driver behind her leaned on the horn , startling her out of her daydream to pull forward maybe six inches . Since when did a measly half-foot merit blasting your horn ? Control freak . Without even looking she knew it was a man at the wheel , ramming the palm of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive slower . Lindsay had her father 's strawberry blond , curly hair . She was four feet five inches and had not grown in almost a year . At her checkup , the doctor joked that maybe Lindsay 's intellectual growth had stunted her body 's progress , but Mariah did n't think that was funny . Lindsay had skipped grades four and seven , and now she was in eighth . No way was she ready for high school , Mariah thought , picturing Lindsay 's beloved posters of Carl Sagan and Lewis Thomas . Lindsay so often asked to be quizzed on the periodic table of the elements that Mariah had the poster laminated . Then there was the Darwinian theory poster , and her two-by-three-foot print of the saltwater fishes of Monterey County . When they left the condo , where would the posters go ? For that matter , where would she and Lindsay go ? The condo and the car were expendable  --  things  --  not vital . In the immediate future she would temporarily return to waiting tables at her mother 's cafe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grove landmark . Francis Moon , 1883 , read the painted marker on the front wall , a distant relative on her grandmother 's side . The exterior was weathered cedar and peeling paint , and all summer the window boxes spilled over with geraniums , pansies , phlox , and Cecil Brunner miniature roses . The Owl &; Moon Cafe offered a wide variety of soups , all organic . Their pastries were baked on-site , daily . On Saturday mornings , the line of people waiting for a table could spill halfway down the block , even though Pacific Grove was prone to fog year-round , even when just a few blocks up the sun was shining . Mariah hated waitressing . She looked at every customer and could n't help placing him or her in a sociological context  --  this one an upper-socioeconomic misogynist , that one an abandoned wife when her husband hit his mid-fifties . But she could keep her head down and do it until she found a better-paying job . She 'd given up a lot more to meet Lindsay 's needs . Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about it . How could the university do that to her after eight years ? How dare they wait until the last minute to tell her ? Each year Mariah felt she was that much closer to a permanent hire . It was too late to apply for a teaching job anywhere else . The adjunct positions had already been snapped up . She would gather her family together and tell them ... and then what ? Try not to choke on her broken heart . She had sacrificed having a social life , given up time with her daughter because working hard now allowed her to invest in Lindsay 's future . Mariah was a product of public schools , marking time until she could get to college . She was determined to give Lindsay the best of the best despite having no father in the picture . Gammy Bess and Mariah 's mother had worked hard for Mariah to rise above their stations . And now she had failed . Breathing car fumes was muddling her thinking . What she needed was a lemon tart and a cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grateful for any homespun wisdom her grandmother might have . " God shuts doors right and left , Mariah . I wo n't tell you He does n't . But somewhere you least expect it , a little mouse is gnawing a hole , and right there 's the gateway to freedom . " Gammy was straitlaced and old-fashioned , but protective as a mother tiger . Mariah 's mother was a different story . Mariah 's head was filled with memories of her mother 's embarrassing escapades . The opposite of Gammy in every way , she was a professional protester . Sit-ins , gay pride parades , testifying before the city council on chemical runoff into the bay , defending trees slated for removal . She even fought the initiative to eradicate the deer that roamed the El Carmelo cemetery , although they were truly nuisances , causing car accidents and ruining landscapes . Though she supported causes Mariah herself believed in , such as the homeless shelter and the no-kill animal shelter , Mariah still could n't get over the way her mother told dirty jokes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was issued a ticket for it  --  which she fought and won  --  after she pulled up her shirt to show the court that her tiny bosoms could not possibly be offensive . Later , the judge had asked her out . Her mother , in her fifties now , was moored in the " Hey , babe , what 's happenin ' " way of speaking . Every Friday night she went dancing , whooped it up and closed down the bars when other women her age were taking up knitting . Her mother 's name was actually Alice , but she insisted everyone call her Allegra , including Lindsay . " Gammy 's the only grandmother around here , " she 'd said . In music , the term allegro meant quick , lively , and she was that . She did n't wear a bra . She did n't shave in any of the conventional places . " I 'm a peace-loving , left-leaning hippie , " she 'd proudly tell anyone who asked about her political affiliation . But while hippies had a reputation for being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She drove Mariah crazy with her advice . On more than one occasion , she 'd told Mariah to " loosen up , and have more sex . " As if sex was nothing more than jogging , or painting your nails , and something you could n't wait to discuss with your mother . When Mariah was seven years old , her mother had leaned a ladder against the cafe building in order to reach the sign . " All the way to the top , babe , " she said , and Mariah , who 'd never been scared of heights , did as she was told , with her mother climbing up after her . But once up there , the world looked different . Cars on Ocean Avenue hurtled by so fast Mariah was sure they could never stop in time for a pedestrian . The cemetery across the street looked huge , dotted with dozens of gravestones that stuck up out of the earth like dead men 's tongues . Just to think there was a corpse under each grave made her light-headed . What if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her off the ladder ? Mariah 's stomach tied itself into a Gordian knot , but did Allegra notice ? Of course not . Her mother painted " sizing , " a substance that looked like glue , all over the carved wooden moon in the cafe sign . Then Allegra took from her apron pocket a perfectly ordinary package , and peeled away the tissue paper to reveal what must have been the thinnest sheet of gold in the world . Mariah remembered thinking that her mother must have found the treasure at the end of the rainbow . Gold was the stuff of pirates , Spanish doubloons , or the queen of England 's crown . Allegra showed her how to brush gently over the fragile gold paper , teasing it away from the package , and then lightly laying it down on the now sticky wooden moon . " Go on , babe , " she said . " Paint . " Mariah hesitated . " What if I make a mistake ? " " You ca n't make a mistake , " Allegra told her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mariah painted , watching the gold catch the light . Its wrinkles disappeared as they melded with the sizing . Down on the sidewalk , the cafe sign had looked like a wooden plank with a badly painted owl . Up on the ladder , however , Mariah saw that the owl 's feathers were individually carved , and all together they made up the outstretched wing . Her mother hugged her from behind , and Mariah felt the ladder wobble . " Whoops ! " Allegra said , and wiggled it a second time just for fun . " Mariah Janis Joplin Moon , " she said , " you just gave that old moon a second life ! " Except Mariah had done nothing of the sort . Things weathered quickly in the beach climate , and every six months the sign required maintenance . Her mother was open and easy with everyone else , but from Mariah she kept secrets . How many times had Mariah asked her who her father was  --  just his name  --  and each time Allegra gave a different answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way across Europe . And when Mariah pushed too hard , her mother said , " He was the man in the moon ! Now stop with the questions before I lose my temper . " And do what ? Mariah wanted to ask . Punish me by making me listen to another Grateful Dead Live bootleg ? Her heart heavy , Mariah parked in the slot behind the cafe next to her mother 's ancient VW bus . Gardener 's Alley was narrow and cobbled , and fragrant with garbage . As she walked around front she looked up at the sign . It was eye-catching . Decorative , like the window boxes stuffed with miniature meadow grasses that defined Pacific Grove and its neighbor , Carmel-by-the-Sea . But The Owl &; Moon was n't like any other place . Inside it became its own little country . Like the kitchen of an Iowa farmhouse , the bead board walls had been painted over so many times that they looked doused with cream . The floor was old planked pine stained the color of chestnuts , and deeply distressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threshold , Allegra had painted a mariner 's compass in primary colors , its needle fixed on true north . Mariah walked inside and slipped behind the counter where two customers sat on stools . Gammy was deep in conversation with one of them , a man in his forties . Mariah waved hello and went into the kitchen . Simon , in his chef 's apron , held an industrial-size tin of ground cumin seed above a large soup vat . Yawning like he had n't woken all the way up , he spilled some into the soup , not even bothering to measure . " Hi , Simon , " she said . " Where 's Allegra ? " He nodded his head toward the stairway that led to the upstairs apartment . " Catching a few z 's before the lunch crowd arrives . " That seemed odd to Mariah , because Allegra rose with the sun and partied until last call . " Are you sure ? " Simon rolled his eyes . " Why on earth would I waste my time telling you a lie ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making her way upstairs . Snippy as usual . I 'd be like that , too , she thought , if Gammy was on my case all day about sexual preferences . Ha . At least Simon had a sexual anything . Mariah began to count up the years since she 'd had a romance and quickly stopped because it was too depressing . As usual , the door was unlocked . Monterey County 's history was rich with trouble . Thieving pirates , Spanish invaders , and blatant abuse of migrant workers were a few of its more notable sins . But unlocked doors and helping strangers remained part of the town 's charm . " Mom ? " she said as she closed the door behind her . " Everything okay ? " Her mother sat up on the sofa where she 'd been sleeping , her cheek branded with the weave of a throw pillow . " Babe ! What a nice surprise . I did n't expect to see you today . Let me give you a hug . " All in the same moment , Mariah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she told her the bad news , and noticed how pale her mother 's face was . " Are you catching a cold ? " she asked . " Of course not , " Allegra said , grinning . " I stayed out too late last night , but let me tell you , it was worth it . Mm-mm , do I love a hunky fireman ! Please tell me you came over here to help serve the lunch crowd . Your grandmother means well , but she just ca n't move all that fast anymore . We 're going to have to hire a waitress . " Mariah bit her tongue before she told her maybe not . " As it happens , I can work the rest of the day . " " Hot damn ! " Allegra said , twisting her long black hair into a bun and securing it with chopsticks . " Let 's haul our gorgeous asses downstairs and get to work . " Asses . Mariah winced at her mother 's choice of words , and the scent of patchouli floating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rhythm Mariah could never keep up with . Growing up with twenty-four-hour access to food that regular mothers reserved for special occasions did n't rot Mariah 's teeth . Before she was Lindsay 's age , she 'd tired of sugar . Her Achilles ' heel , however , was her mother 's lemon bars . Lemons are fruit , she told herself as she ate two , then three of the powdered sugar-topped delicacies . Between her schedule and Lindsay 's , eating right came second to simply eating . Judge Judy , a sociological gold mine , had once publicly stated that " no child ever died from having McDonald 's for dinner , " and that was good enough for Mariah . Some days all Mariah managed was vending machine chips . And drinking eight glasses of water a day ? No problem , if Diet Coke counted . " How do the bakery cases look ? " Allegra shouted out from the kitchen . " Not bad , " Mariah said . " We could stand a few more peanut butter cookies . " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the counter smiled at Mariah . " I hate to bother , " he said , " but could I possibly get a take-away tea ? " Take-away ? Just when she thought she 'd heard all the idioms , here was another . So many tourists visited the Monterey Coast that there really was no such thing as off-season . Mariah took a new tea bag from the box under the counter . " We do n't get a lot of hot tea drinkers this time of year , " she said as she filled a paper cup and fitted it with a cardboard sleeve . " I see , " he said . " I 'm afraid Guinness was absent from your menu . " " Sorry to disappoint you , " she said , thinking he was probably just another alcoholic fostered by the stress of working to afford living in one of the richest counties in America . " Anything else I can get you ? " He shook his head no , and then took out his wallet to pay . " Tea and scones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever dragons await me . " Scottish , Mariah noted . A land whose history was written in war . " Dragons are in short supply around here , but come back and see us again . " He smiled once more , and she could n't help thinking of Sean Connery , who looked attractive and dangerous all at the same time . " Count on it . " The unexpected thrill of a man flirting with her lifted her spirits . With that crooked smile she 'd bet her last dime he was already in a relationship . In a week 's time of asking customers she could find out everything about him from his marital status to his shoe size , if she cared to . A small town could triple in population , turn its Victorian houses into bed-and-breakfasts galore , but the core of people who lived there remained a merrily dysfunctional family . She filled napkin dispensers and monkeyed with the automatic dishwasher everyone knew was dying . Either they 'd have to get a loan for a new one or hire someone to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hard to earn and so easily spent ? From years of teaching Mariah knew that when the economy faltered , families weakened , and sometimes split up . It was the twenty-first century . " Downsizing " had made it into the lexicon . Schools were overcrowded . In her Intro to Sociology text a map of the geometric increase in global population told the story : too many people , not enough space . In 1798 , Thomas Malthus had predicted overpopulation would lead to social chaos . His theory was dismissed as flawed  --  failing to take into consideration medical advances and lower death rates  --  but just try to find a parking place in Pacific Grove and his point was clear . Her mother , counting the register till , suddenly shrieked . " There are three one-dollar bills in here ! How are we supposed to make it through lunch ? " Off she ran to the Bank of America on the corner , while Gammy watched the tail end of All My Children on the tiny counter television and complained it was high time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an immoral story line , " she said hotly . " I feel like writing ABC a letter . " " Soap operas are dripping with sin , " Simon called out through the order bar . " It 's make-believe , you dodo , " she said . Simon laughed . " It 's probably a sin to watch them . " Gammy huffed . " God and I have things all worked out . Can you say the same ? " Though in the pit of her belly the job news sat like a cold lump , Mariah 's dysfunctional family was doing all right . She 'd find a way through this . " God better grant me a bale of patience this afternoon , " Gammy said later that day , coming out from the kitchen with a tray full of bowls of artichoke soup . " If I make it through the day without killing Simon Huggins it will be a miracle . " " What did he do now ? " Mariah asked , adding a handful of cracker packets to the tray . Gammy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's just trying to get my goat . " Allegra slid by them toward the kitchen , throwing over her shoulder , " Then quit leaving your goat tied up where he can get to it ! " " Ha , ha , " Gammy said , taking the tray to table four . " Mariah , your mother is as funny as a crutch . " " You 'll get no arguments from me , " Mariah said , then turned her attention to table two , where she opened her order pad . " Everyone decided ? " A middle-aged , brown-haired woman looked over her reading glasses . " I 'd like a cup of artichoke soup , but not if it has MSG in it . " " All our soups are organic , " Mariah said . " So that means no MSG ? " " Correct . " The woman turned to the elderly man with her . He had to be at least eighty , Mariah thought . He was a sweet-looking old guy in his red shirt and blue suspenders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a bowl of artichoke soup . " " Daddy , you ca n't finish a whole bowl , " the woman said . " Do n't you tell me what I ca n't do . I damn well want a bowl , and what 's more , I want an oatmeal cookie to go with it . " Mariah waited while the argument ran its course . There it was , her future staring at her , the day when parent became child , and there was another lifetime of mothering to do . The definition of family was complex these days , what with blended families and single mothers galore . Gammy and Simon feuded constantly . What kind of soup to make , spotted owls , strip malls , gay rights , and Jesus . Except for each other , no one took them seriously . Mariah thought of her daughter , Lindsay , fortunately absent from this fray . She would be in art class about this time , the only class she detested . Just that morning , Mariah had listened to yet another plea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pots , I could be memorizing the periodic table of the elements . " " I know you hate art , sweetie , " Mariah had said . " Just try to hang in there this one last time and I promise I 'll make a date to talk to Mrs. Shiasaka and see about getting you switched . " " Why ca n't you talk to her today ? " " Because today I have an appointment with the dean . We 're already running so late I 'm going to have to drive ninety miles an hour , and I have to sign my contract today or our benefits will lapse , and next week we start second quarter scheduling  --  " Wow . Did n't all that feel like a lifetime ago ? The father-daughter table was not making headway . It was time to step in . " How about I bring you a cup of soup , sir , and if you want more , then I bring you a refill ? " " Now that 's the first intelligent thing I 've heard all morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget my cookie . " " Daddy ! " the woman said . " Here I am trying to help you watch your sugar  --  " " Mariah ! Where 's my cinnamon roll ? " one of the regulars asked , and she nodded and ran to fetch one hot from the baking tray . " What good 's a bagel without cream cheese , " another customer announced as Mariah was trying to take a to-go order over the phone . " Coming , " she said , resisting the temptation to yell that if they wanted fast food , drive through Taco Bell . Running back and forth from the kitchen to the cold case , she had no time to think about her problems . When there was a lull , she looked to see what needed to be restocked . Among items in the glass cold case were cheesecake , marzipan candies , The Owl &; Moon 's famous Chocolate Cherry Thunder fudge , and a round of sharp cheddar for the apple tarts . The nonrefrigerated case held all manner of pastries , sweet rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the oven they went directly into pink boxes tied with kite string . Out of the corner of her eye she watched her mother answer the phone , tickle a customer 's new baby , wrap fudge , and box up cookies like she was working every station on the assembly line . Her face looked drawn . Sometimes Mariah could n't bear how hard Allegra and Gammy worked . The Owl &; Moon was Faustian , ruling over their souls . Mariah had vowed never to let it take over hers , but the aroma in the cafe was comforting . The soup warmed you to the core . The pastry melted on your tongue . Conversation was always interesting . It was easy to become addicted , which meant regular customers eventually turned into demanding regular customers , and there you were , stuck in a loop of supply and demand with no time to rest . From 11:40 until 2:25 she refilled coffees , emptied three pitchers of iced tea , and served artichoke soup until the last of it was gone . Her own stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could n't wait to have a bowl of soup herself , even if all that was left was beef barley . All afternoon Mariah replayed the brief moment with the dragon-slaying Mr. Tea-and-scones . Since she did n't date , she felt it was perfectly acceptable to indulge in fantasies . A real kiss would probably make her cry . Ever since Lindsay was born , she told herself she did n't have the time , the right clothes , but Lindsay was the reason she did n't date . What did men call the children of single women ? Baggage . Lovely word . Spoiled rotten babies that men were , most of them wanted a mommy , and they wanted to be that mommy 's only child . " Attention , everybody ! " Allegra called out , tapping a spoon against a glass . " Time for our daily joke . What did Confucius say when he saw the man standing on the toilet ? " She waited a moment , and then finished with , " That man high on pot ! " The customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Working here permanently would drive her mad . She 'd look for a job in an office , a research position , learn to write grants , substitute teach , anything but waitressing . But what skills did she have ? A hunt-and-peck typist , she needed Lindsay 's help to get anywhere on her computer . Decent jobs of any kind were hard to come by in Monterey County . The daily joke laughter was soon replaced by pleas  --  " I have n't been helped yet " and " What do you mean you 're out of Chocolate Cherry Thunder fudge ? " She edged by her mother to get to the cold case . Allegra patted Mariah on the behind as she walked by with more cinnamon rolls . " Chill out , " she said . " Take life a little less seriously and you 'll have a lot more fun . " What do you get when you cross a hippie with a mother , Mariah wanted to ask , and then let Allegra have it for every embarrassing comment since the day she was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm still waiting for my fudge . " " There 's probably more in the back , " Mariah said . " Let me ring up this check and then I 'll go look . " The Owl &; Moon would never lack for customers . If a person came in for Chocolate Bomb cookies for her daughter 's birthday , while she waited to have them boxed she 'd smell the paper-thin rosemary-garlic Cheese Pennies , and pick up two dozen . Then she 'd ask for a taste of the gleaming slab of Chocolate Cherry Thunder fudge . She 'd buy a small piece , unwrap it in the car , take one bite , and turn up Monterey Jack on KMPG , the drive-time radio DJ who played old Nat King Cole vocals and plenty of Ella . Pinch-by-pinch , the fudge would disappear . Mariah knew firsthand how that fudge made for a moment of pleasure no one could take from you . When had her life come down to settling for moments ? Why did she live at the beach when she had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a walk ? So eager to make a career , she 'd spent the early years of her daughter 's life reading student papers so late into the night that Lindsay had learned to put herself to bed . Around two-thirty there was a lull , and Mariah noticed Gammy was limping . " Go sit down , " she told her . Gammy chose the same stool Mr. Tea-and-scones had inhabited . " Gammy , " she said , wiping down the counter with their bleach-smelling cleaner , " who was the Scottish guy this morning ? " Her grandmother grinned . " Oh , you mean the one who looks like a movie star ? " " I really did n't notice . " " Careful , Pinocchio . Your nose is growing . " Mariah scrubbed hard at a stain . " Never mind . " Gammy clasped her hands to her chest . " Maybe he came all the way from Scotland to fall desperately in love with you and give me more great-grandchildren to spoil and Lindsay some siblings to play with . " " Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope . " " Gammy , the last thing I need in my life right now is a man . " Her grandmother untied her stained apron . As she brushed off crumbs , she said , " Dating would n't kill you . You could try that internet dating service . Who knows ? You might make a friend . If you ever want to  --  " " I lost my job ! " Mariah blurted out , and there she stood , her last customers of the day sipping coffee with no idea that their waitress was on the verge of tears . For a moment or two , Gammy 's face looked every one of its sixty-eight years . Her snow-white hair was teased and sprayed into a proper old-lady helmet hairdo , but no amount of product could hide the baby-pink scalp peeking out . " Go give that fellow his check , " Gammy said , as if her granddaughter had told her nothing more important than the mail had arrived . " Go on , now . I 'll make us some cocoa . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Mariah composed herself , looking out the window as the fog started to roll in , erasing the sunny day that had begun so promisingly . There was a screech of brakes and a narrowly missed fender-bender that probably involved a protected deer with a mouthful of flowers , and someone started cussing . And then , just like she did at the end of every business day , Allegra started singing , " Come on people now , smile  --  " But she never finished the verse , because she fainted dead away behind the counter . Continues ...
