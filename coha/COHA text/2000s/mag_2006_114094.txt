MIKE KRZYZEWSKI should have been in a jovial mood after his then top-ranked Blue Devils scraped out an 81-68 win at home over No. 14 North Carolina State on Jan. 18 . The victory extended the Blue Devils ' record to 17-0 , which equaled their best start ever , yet Coach K had a bitter taste in his mouth . " Some of the things being written about us -- 'Will they go undefeated ? '  - -  are overdone , " Krzyzewski said , adding that his normally implacable players were succumbing to the hype . " They had a lot of pressure on them . " // If going undefeated was a problem for Duke , then the Blue Devils found the solution last Saturday at the MCI Center in Washington , D.C. , where they faced unranked Georgetown . Looking listless on defense and disorganized on offense , they allowed the Hoyas to make 61.5% of their shots in an 87-84 loss . That upset headlined a seismic day in college basketball that saw two other unbeatens , Florida and Pittsburgh , fall to unranked teams . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to No. 2 in the rankings . ) The defeats ensured that yet another season will pass without a team 's reprising the perfection last achieved by the 1976 Indiana Hoosiers. // Saturday 's events were a reminder that January is too soon to speculate about any team 's going undefeated . Florida ( 17-1 at week 's end ) and Pittsburgh ( 15-1 ) , which lost to Tennessee and St. John 's , respectively , deserve credit for their strong starts , but only two of their wins came against teams in this week 's AP Top 25 . The Blue Devils were n't exactly romping their way through the ACC ; they needed a half-court shot by guard Sean Dockery to beat Virginia Tech at home on Dec. 4. // Against Georgetown , Duke 's superlative shooting guard , J.J. Redick , scored 41 points for the second time this season , but the Blue Devils ' habit of overrelying on his brilliance --  " J.J.-watching , " Krzyzewski calls it -- finally caught up with them . Senior forward Shelden Williams , plagued by foul trouble , had a season-low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McRoberts , a McDonald 's All-American , had just one rebound . " Georgetown 's sense of urgency was higher than ours , " Duke assistant coach Chris Collins said . " It shows that no matter who you are , you have to play well to win . " // Florida , meanwhile , had been winning thanks to the underdog mind-set the team adopted after being unranked in the preseason polls . During an 80-76 loss to the Volunteers at Thompson-Boling Arena in Knoxville ( page 92 ) , however , in what coach Billy Donovan called " the toughest road environment we faced all season , " the rattled Gators committed 19 turnovers . // Pittsburgh had the softest schedule of the once-beatens , with just one nonconference game outside its home state . The Panthers ' shortcomings were exposed by St. John 's at Madison Square Garden , where they shot 3 for 16 from three-point range in a 55-50 loss . " It 's a reminder how tough it is to win every night , " Pitt coach Jamie Dixon said . " I pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we have a long way to go . " // As every coach knows , defeats can be teaching opportunities . With a chance for his team to tie the game in the waning seconds against Georgetown , Duke freshman point guard Greg Paulus dribbled into traffic and lost the ball . Krzyzewski later told Paulus that he should have passed to Redick , the kind of lesson that can be taught only through adversity . Better to learn such things in mid-January than at the end of March .
