Our stones often need to bear " Do n't try this at home " warnings . In this case , however , we 're happy to encourage readers to take up cross-country running . But if you find yourself facing a course like the one described in this story , well , do n't say we did n't warn you ... <p> THE NEW FELLOW NEVER talked about himself much , and details came out in little dribbles . But he mentioned having once been a teenager in the hill country - a stretch of poor farms and limestone bluffs about an hour north of town . He had a favorite few tales about running cross-country for the local high school : His Phys Ed teacher first saw his potential and egged him into running competitively . Without training and with a naturally lousy sense of pace , the recruit managed to finish dead last for a desperately weak team . But after another year of growth and three thousand miles underfoot , he became a powerful Senior . Laughing at his own misfortunes , our new friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except that on the eve of the season 's first race he got a wicked case of shin splints and he did n't run another two steps until after the State Championship was in the books . Kip Logan was his name , as far as anybody can tell . A few of us - our most imaginative/paranoid citizens - still liked to dwell on the gaps and little question marks in his personal history . For instance , nobody felt quite sure where Kip was before he came to live with us , or what he did , or how he made his money . Nobody could remember him mentioning parents or any siblings of consequence , and nobody ever stepped forward to say yes , they knew him as a boy . But then again , does n't everybody have gaps and incongruities in their life story ? Think about it : You would be hard-pressed to write the definitive biography of your very best friend . And Kip was never more than a close acquaintance to any of us . Besides , his hometown nearly died when its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the county consolidated its schools , boarding up his old high school in the process . Whoever Kip was , he always acted like a genuinely friendly fellow , throwing out big smiles while speaking to us with slow , pleasant tones . As a general rule , people did n't consider him particularly bright . But everybody has to wonder now . When we talk about him , we always seem to mention how careful he was . The man never boasted about his successes , and he never lectured to us , and I am the only person who can remember him knowing anything that you would n't think he would know . Even after a lifetime spent running , he happily claimed to be helpless when it came to calculating a reliable pace time . Talking about himself , Kip Logan always used excessively humble tones . And frankly , his physical appearance helped this illusion of simplicity : He was tall and pretty-boy handsome , with long legs that carried a muscled body and a pair of shoulders far broader than typical for a quality distance runner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his skin , which was gold in the summer and ruddy-chalk in the depths of winter . His hair was thick and exceptionally blond . Yet he openly admitted that a portion of that rich mane was artificial . Male-pattern baldness had cropped up a few years ago , and he 'd patched the gaps with an implanted carpet . As for his age , I think it 's safe to say that Kip looked like a youthful man-child of forty or forty-one . In other words , he was a spectacularly well-preserved creature greatly enjoying his middle fifties . I 've spoken to a few local race directors about old Kip . Entry forms have certain mandatory details : You supply your name and address , phone numbers and T-shirt size . And you have to admit your age on race day , plus give your date of birth . Why both figures are necessary , I 'm not sure . Maybe it 's to keep clumsy liars out of the mix . But I 've studied a few of Kip 's old entry forms , and in every case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whenever we raced , Kip beat me , and not just by a little bit . Which meant that he had a chokehold on our age group , plus all of the gift certificates and little gold-painted medals that come with that rarified distinction . Waivers are another common feature in race entries . And there is always a single line at the bottom where you supply your signature and the date . To what degree a waiver matters , I do n't know . I 've endured in some horrendously organized events , and if somebody had died because of the lousy traffic control or the lack of paramedics , I 'm sure somebody else 's ass would have been sued , regardless of any name scribbled as an after-thought . For thirty-some years , I have run competitive races , and easily , Kip 's waiver was the best that I 've ever read : " Cross country is a brutal sport meant for self-abusive personalities , " he wrote , " and I , the undersigned , am a major-league idiot for trying this damned thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably will , I have nobody to blame but my stupid self . And with that in mind , I promise to expect the unexpected , and I will tolerate the miserable , and if I die on the course , I would prefer to be buried exactly where I fall .... " Kip told it this way : After thirty-five years spent in other places , he came home again . By home , he did n't mean the town where he grew up , since that tiny crossroads had just about expired . No , he moved to our city , purchasing a baby mansion on the rich-person 's boulevard . Paying for it in cash , one persistent rumor would claim . Where that money came from was always a puzzler . On occasion , Kip mentioned working overseas for some obscure Dutch corporation . Malaysia and Brazil played roles in the occasional aside . And more than once , he muttered a few words about investments in real estate and stocks , smiling in a beguiling fashion whenever he admitted , " My guesses did a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force in the local running scene . He entered every race at our end of the state , always placing among the top ten or fifteen males - a tremendous achievement for a citizen who could see Social Security looming . He worked out with the fast groups as well as linking up with a few notable talents who usually trained by themselves . And he began showing up at track club meetings and our various social functions . During that first year , he simultaneously dated two young women - gazelles nearly as fast on their feet as he was . As for employment , Kip seemed to lack both the time and the need . He was n't retired so much as he was incredibly busy with the disciplined life of an eternal athlete . Hard runs were woven around sessions in the weight room , plus he was a regular in both yoga and pilates classes . His diet was rich with nuts and green leaves , and he never drank more than half a beer . And where our local twenty-five-year-old stallions were a grim , brutally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wearing his boyish zest along with a killer wardrobe , he liked to drive around town in a BMW - a convertible , of course - waving at his many good acquaintances while the blond hair rippled in the wind . I would confess to feeling envious of Kip , but " envy " does n't do my complicated feelings justice . And I liked the man . Always . So far as I know , I was first to hear about Kip 's cross-country race . He 'd been living with us for nearly fourteen months . On Thursdays , half a dozen old dogs would meet up at Galley Lake to run tempos . It was two miles to the lap , and a good tempo is supposed to be twenty seconds a mile slower than your honest 10K pace . Kip and I decided to do three miles . A lap and a half . He finished at least ninety seconds ahead of me . By the time I reached the mark , he was breathing normally , smiling happily , offering me a buoyant " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a hot afternoon in May . I needed water , and he drank a little sip from the fountain , as if to be polite . Then we started trotting that last mile around the lake , heading back for the starting line and the younger forty-something runners who were already finishing their four miles . Kip was capable of an innocent , almost goofy smile . Something about the blue eyes and that endless grin made people believe there was n't much inside his pretty-boy head . " A blond with implants , " was the often-heard joke . And his voice was usually slow and careful , as if his words needed to be examined , singly and together , before any sentence could be shown to the world . " Don , " he said to me . " I 'm thinking about holding a race . " " Yeah ? " I said . " An X-country race . " He said it that way . " X " as in the letter , and then " country . " " Cross-country ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , he let his big smile get bigger and the blue eyes dreamier , and staring off into the watery distance , he told me , " At my old stomping grounds . On the trails outside Enderville . What do you think ? " " When ? " " This October , " he said . " If there 's a free weekend . " Our local marathon was at the beginning of November , and there was a tune-up 15K four weeks earlier . But those other weekends were probably available . " Sounds like fun , " I allowed . " I hope it sounds fun . " Then he glanced at me . " You know , I just had an idea . Just this minute . " I did n't believe him . Something about his manner felt false . Although why that was and why I remember a detail like that , I do n't know . And besides , what did it matter when he actually dreamed up anything ? " I 'll have to map out a course , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I 'd driven past it on occasion , and from the highway , those bluffs seemed brutally rough . " Prize money , " he said . " What do you think ? " " It 's up to you . " " As an incentive , " he explained . " Are you going to run the race yourself ? " I asked . " I should n't , no . " Laughing quietly , he pointed out , " I 'll have too much to do just running the finish line . " That was welcome news . I told Kip , " Prize money would be an exceptionally good thing . " " How much ? " " As much as you can afford , " I suggested , working hard to sound as if I might , just might , be kidding . Kip had a huge box of entry forms printed up , and he asked some of the quicker runners to help put them on windshields after the Sassafras 5K . I agreed , but as it happened , my right hip - my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling me back into the middle of the pack . By the time I finished , I was limping , and by the time I found Kip , the chore was done . " Ice , " Kip suggested , noting my rocking gait . I nodded and then consciously ignored his advice . My little Hyundai had a piece of gold paper tucked under one wiper . " First Annual Hill-Hell Run , " it read . Unfolding it , I found the disclaimer and had a good laugh . Then I noticed the prize money , and my first thought was that my slow-witted buddy was an exceptionally bad proofreader . " Oh , no , " he told me . " The amounts are correct . " We were standing among the other finishers , watching the Sassafras Awards being handed out . Smacking the entry form with a fingertip , I asked , " Do you mean this ? Two hundred dollars cash for an age-group winner ? " He shrugged . " I want runners at my starting line . " " Oh , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And two thousand dollars for winning the whole show ? " He flashed a big smile my way . Maybe I 'm remembering it wrong , but something was lurking in those eyes - a sharpness revealed for a half-instant - and then his expression instantly turned back to beach-boy simple . " Two grand ? " I repeated . " With prize money to tenth place ? " Shrugging , Kip pointed out , " There wo n't be any double awards , so the wealth 's going to be shared . " In other words , the top ten finishers , male and female , would be yanked from age-group consideration . Of course two hundred dollars would n't make any difference in my life . But the idea of winning that tidy sum for being the fastest fifty-something ... well , it was a delicious promise . I was still grinning when the Sassafras race director called out Kip 's name . Once again , he had won our age-group , and for his achievement , Kip earned the privilege of walking up front to receive a coin-sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus a gift certificate for fifteen dollars off his next pair of running shoes . What made the moment memorable was the audience : A sudden silence descended , followed by a few quiet whispers . Then the applause came , but it was n't the light , polite applause that follows pleasantly contrived moments like these . What I heard was hard clapping accompanied by shouts , one of the young stallions throwing his arms high in the air , calling out , " Kipper ! Kip , my man ! My buddy ! Kip , Kipper ! " MY HIP IMPROVED , and I started building my mileage again . But old bodies do n't relish sudden change or too much ambition . I sputtered in early September , and then managed a brief recovery . But my comeback collapsed during the fifth mile of the Classic 15R . My hip was screaming , and for the first time in thirty years , I gave up , accepting a humiliating ride back to the finish line . The next morning , I saw the first in a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an exam table while an expert on joint disease-a young woman barely in her thirties-calmly explained what was wrong with me and what she proposed to do about it . " Titanium , " I heard , followed by the words , " You are a lucky man . " " Lucky ? How ? " I asked . " Our new hips are quite reliable , " she promised . " Under normal conditions , you can expect twenty or thirty years of use . And of course there 's always the chance that new materials will come onto the market . Bioceramics . Or perhaps , living hips grown from your own bone tissue . " " I 'm fifty-three . " But she did n't understand my point . With a professional grin and minimal charm , she explained , " We do n't need to operate in the near-future . Anti-inflammatories and a change of habits should delay surgery for a year , perhaps eighteen months . Depending on your personal tolerances , of course . " " I am fifty-three years old , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll never run again , " I blurted . " That 's what you 're telling me . Maybe we 'll be growing hips like com in another twenty years , but by then , I 'll be in my seventies and desperately out of shape . " " Oh , but you 'll still be able to ride a bike and swim , and you can use a low-impact exercise machinery , within limits . " " I know old runners with artificial joints , " I said . " They always try to bike and swim . But they gain weight anyway , and they lose their fitness , and regardless of age , they become fat old people . " The doctor had no canned answers at the ready . She looked at the bright screen before her , studying an assortment of images of naked bones and a single decaying socket . Then with fingers to her lips , she added , " You know , Don ... other than this one sad hip , you 're in excellent condition for a gentleman of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a standard reaction . Surprise and uncamouflaged horror swept across their faces , and probably feeling aches inside their own hips , they would blurt the same reflexive words . " You 'll be back . " Their hope was delivered with an identical tone of voice , reflexively optimistic and minimally informed . The only exception was Kip . Watching my limping approach , he pointed out , " You 've got a hitch in your giddy-up . " And when he heard my plight , he did n't wince or even touch his own hip . He was immune to my pain , nodding while assuring me , " It could be worse news , of course . " " Worse how ? " I asked . But that was too obvious to say . Putting on his pretty-boy smile , Kip said , " But then again , who knows what the future holds ? " I had already entered Kip 's race . But as a rule , I hate standing by , watching runners in action . I 've always been a creature of motion ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And several times , Kip assured me that he did n't need help . He 'd already laid out his course through the forested bluffs , painting the trails with orange arrows and setting up stations at four key points . Runners would search for coolers of water and buckets full of numbered Popsicle sticks . Four sticks had to be retrieved , brought back in order to prove that the full route had been conquered . Everyone would carry a map , and since he 'd closed off entries at five hundred , he still had plenty of time left to make race bibs and see to any other last-minute details . " So you do n't want my help ? " I asked . The smile was bright and imbecilic . Quietly , he conceded , " I do n't need it . But I suppose you could pull race tags , if too many bodies come in too fast . " I woke up that morning believing that I 'd find something else to do . But after coffee , I was driving north , eventually passing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood empty . A handmade sign had been set up three miles past Enderville . " Hill-Hell Run , " it said , pointing me toward the bluffs . Cars were parked up and down a country road . I had to turn around and take one of the last slots . Limping , I slowly covered a quarter-mile of loose gravel , ending up where an abandoned farmstead stood in a bowl-shaped valley , surrounded on three sides by steep limestone hills and mature forest . By then , the runners had gathered behind a long white line , faces stared at a wall of oaks and ash trees that were turning color after the first cold nights of the season . Every other hand was holding a slip of gold paper - the promised maps . " Good luck to you , " Kip shouted . Then he clapped two boards together , and the youngest runners threw themselves into a desperate sprint , fighting to be first into the towering woods . When five hundred runners vanish , the silence can be unnerving . I limped my way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wink and one of two folding chairs waiting next to a large digital clock and a second , much shorter strip of white paint . " The finish line ? " I asked . He nodded , adding , " The finishers come in from there . " He was pointing in the opposite direction from where the pack had gone . " Have a spare map ? " " On the table , " he said . A row of shoeboxes was on top of a small folding table , each box empty except for two or three unused race packets . I fished out my own packet and glanced at my bib number-8 - then opened the accompanying map . The racecourse was shown as a thin red line lain over the photocopy of a topographic map . Four times , the runner would move out to a distant station , pick up his Popsicle stick and then come back again . The race headed upriver and then came back again , the second leg following a snaking tributary . Then it returned again , taking an entirely different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final station waiting on the outskirts of Enderville . The entire course created a long , flattened X. And what impressed me was how exceptionally complicated every leg looked : I was sitting there , calm and rested . Yet I was having trouble following all the loops and side loops and the dozen or so places where trails crossed one another . Very quietly , I asked Kip , " What is all this ? " " My course map , " he replied . The smile had n't left his face . " You 're serious , " I said . And when he did n't rise to defend himself , I asked , " What did people say about this map ? " " Many words . Not many of them complimentary . " I could imagine the scene . " But as I explained it to the runners , there 's plenty of help along the way . I marked the course . Where the trails cross , I put down arrows . Easy to see , very easy to follow . " " While racing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If I was running at full speed , " I said , " charging through the woods , in the shadows , up and down hills ... and then I came to this intersection .... " I pointed at a tangle of lines . " Which way would I go ? " " It depends , " he said . " On what ? " " Well , you would have to follow the first arrow that I painted . " I stared at Kip for a long while . From high in the hills , we heard yelling and then an incoherent young voice , male and furious . That 's when I finally asked , " How would I know which arrow was the first arrow ? " Kip did n't answer . " Are they different colors ? Are they labeled ? What ? " But he did n't seem particularly interested in the topic . Standing up abruptly , he turned . I had n't heard any noise , but he must have . To somebody still not visible , he said , " Over here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-girlfriends emerged from the shadows . Half our age and perfectly fit , she was lovely and she was fuming . With a voice verging on a scream , she reported , " There 's barely a trail up there . Kip ? Kip ? I thought you had this all figured out . " To her and to me , he said , " I do . " " Bullshit , " she told him . He said nothing . Then one of the young stallions emerged from the opposite end of the clearing . " Hey , Kipper , " he began , one hand wiping at a ragged cut on his bloody forearm . " People are wandering around everywhere , Kipper . They 're lost , and they 're pissed . It 's a mess up there ! " The race director shrugged his broad shoulders . Then he sat down again , and the two competitors turned back into the trees . A few more curses drifted over us , wandering in from random directions . Finally Kip turned to me , still smiling , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . " Huh ? " I muttered . " In mathematics , " he told me , " it is the symbol for quantities unknown . " I offered a weak nod . Nothing more . " Do you know why ? " He winked , explaining , " That great old mathematician , Descartes , wrote La Gomtrie . His original manuscript was full of equations using a , b , and c for what is known . While x , y , and z represented mystery numbers . But when the book was being typeset , the printer did n't have enough of ys and zs for all of the equations . So he mostly used the x , which is where the time-honored convention first began . " I said , " Huh , " again . " X , " he said , making crossed line in the grass between his feet . " The symbol is one of the first marks made by any child , if only by accident . And it surely must have been one of the earliest geometric forms drawn by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I guess - " " On a treasure map , does n't the X lead us to the pirates " chest ? " Kip glanced at me , asking , " More than anything , what would you like to find ? If you had a shovel and map , I mean . If you could dig deep and uncover any possible wonder ... ? " I hesitated . Suddenly I was sitting with a person I did n't know , his language and smart voice taking me by surprise . In vain , I tried to conjure up some worthy response . Or better , I wanted to find some way to ask my friend to explain his sudden , unique transformation . But there was n't time . Moments later , half a dozen runners plunged out into the open . They were coming from a third direction - a line of scrawny people bathed in sweat and adrenaline . Judging by their body language , the angriest member had claimed the task of trotting up to Kip . " Will you give us some help here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Kip took off his smile . Underneath his chair was a gray metal box . He calmly opened it and reached in , removing six twenty-dollar bills . " Fifteen for the entry fee , and five dollars for your gas and trouble . Does that sound fair ? " The runners stopped short . One woman had a deep gash on her knee , while the man in back looked as if he had fallen down an entire hillside . They glanced at each other , measuring moods . Then each took the offered bill and started jogging back to their cars . Waiting inside that box were twin stacks of new twenties . Kip had come here knowing exactly what would happen , and he was ready for it . I do n't know what startled me more : That this elaborate disaster had been anticipated , or that this man with whom I had run for more than a year had suddenly shown me an interest in , if not a true talent for , mathematics , and perhaps for skills that were even stranger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remarkably , nearly seventy of them eventually returned to the finish line , each having delivered the necessary four Popsicle sticks marked with their bib number . But even among those finishers , there were controversies and sour looks . The fastest runner in the group-a twenty-three-year-old ex-University star-had gotten profoundly lost . He 'd circled Enderville at least twice before stumbling over the last station , and by the time he sprinted home , he won nothing but second place in his age group and sixty-fifth overall . " This is n't right , " he chanted throughout the awards ceremony . The first male was a stocky fellow in his middle forties - a self-made expert in tracking and wilderness survival who admitted that he had ignored the various game trails that Kip had used , preferring to follow his instincts overland . The top woman was his eleven-year-old daughter - a bright beaming girl more thrilled by the silver trophy than by any bland check for a thousand dollars . From what I could tell , speed had nothing to do with the finishing order . Luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a positive , since the majority of the finishers were my age or older - backof-the-pack joggers who attacked the course as a morning-long adventure . One graybeard held a rag to his face , mopping up the blood streaming from a tangle of thorn cuts . " You 're the lucky one , " he told me . " You did n't have to go up there . " I was feeling lucky , but only to a point . " Next year ? " asked the male champion . " Is there going to be a second Annual Hill-Hell Run ? " But Kip never quite replied . He looked at us , his brain probably formulating an empty answer , and then half a hundred voices screamed together , everyone laughing painfully , begging , " No way , please God , no ! " After that , like gas under pressure , everyone dispersed . Kip crammed his gear into the little BMW - everything , that is , but the cooler and buckets of Popsicle sticks - and then he drove me back to my car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told me . I tried to find encouraging words . But the man did n't act concerned about how he looked to the world . He was smiling like a maniac , and all I could think of saying was , " Later . " With a last little wink , he lied to me . " Soon , " he said . And with a little wave and a flash of blond hair , Kip was gone . I drove home , leaving my athletic life in storage . Over those next days and weeks , with my hip aching and the rest of my body feeling ancient , I considered what kind of treasure I 'd like to dig up on a tropical beach . A new hip , sure , and maybe a couple new legs too . And then , almost against my will , I discovered that the average day is full of fertile time when you can not run . What astonished me most was how quickly I grew accustomed to being crippled and how much I looked forward to my doctors " appointments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marathon , but it was a cold , raw morning , and I overslept , waking up late and without a hint of regret . The Monday paper had the usual stories about the race . But the big story , at least for me , was in the Tuesday paper : One of our local runners had felt sick before the marathon , but he ran anyway . He was a big fellow whom I knew by name - one of the top ten finishers at Kip 's race . With a terrific bellyache , he managed to chug and walk his way up to the boulevard between the three- and four-mile marks . As it happened , the top cardiac surgeon in the state was standing on his front lawn , sipping green tea while cheering on the competitors , and the foolhardy runner staggered to a halt in front of him and collapsed , stricken with a massive coronary . If the man had dropped a block earlier or a block later , he would have died . But the surgeon did everything perfectly , and the runner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive his stupidity . Accompanying the article was a photograph of that very unlikely place where an appointment with death had been missed . Kip 's baby mansion was standing in the background . And sitting on the front lawn , plain to see , was a FOR SALE BY OWNER sign , over which somebody had painted the single word : SOLD . Kip Logan had moved away and nobody knew just where . But the general assumption , at least among the running community , was that he had been so embarrassed by his fiasco that moving was the least awful solution , followed closely by a tidy suicide . Except I knew that Kip had n't been embarrassed . Much less mortified or wracked by any appealing sense of guilt . The annual track club meeting came in January , and with a sense that this might be the last time , I went to eat pizza and boast about old glories . Everybody seemed pleased to see me , and everybody seemed distracted . At first , I was a little bit hurt by the collective indifference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to throw any casual encouragement my way . The subject of the evening was one of Kip 's ex-girlfriends . On Christmas , she ate too much and got sick , and when she went to her doctor , a routine test identified that she was suffering from routine food poisoning as well as a profoundly cancerous liver . A mere week later , a healthy donor liver was found , and the transplant was a complete success . " She was lucky , " said everybody sitting at my table , and presumably everybody at every other table too . The man on my right asked , " If she had n't gotten sick when she did , what would have happened ? " We nodded grimly , knowing her likely fate . Then without understanding the full significance , I mentioned , " You know , she ran Kip 's race . " Both of his ex-girlfriends had competed , but she was n't the angry one . In the end , she had finished as the fifth-place woman , pocketing five hundred dollars and keeping her four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to everyone in earshot , " This is a funny , strange coincidence . " Most of them did n't see my point . I reminded them about the heart attack on the marathon , and then pointed out , " Two people have had their lives spared . By luck . And both of them happened to have finished the Hill-Hell Run . " Uneasy laughter turned to paranoid silence . Then someone up the table named the father-daughter who won the race . And with a sad tone , she added , " I do n't know if you 'd call it luck , what happened to them .... " " What happened ? " I asked . The graybeard across from me leaned closer . " His wife , her mom ... she was killed in a big wreck last week . Out on the Interstate . " A vague memory tugged . " Their car was crushed between semis , " he told me . I remembered news footage showing a twisted and mangled Jeep . Then another voice called out , telling us , " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter was sitting behind him - " The room was falling silent . " Both walked away from the crash . The mom was dead , but they were unharmed . That 's what I heard . Barely a mark on either one of them . " It took another four weeks for me to make up my mind . And even then , I was playing games with myself . I drove up north with the intention of poking around Enderville , talking to the last of the locals and perhaps seeing if I could look at any of the old school records . Did a boy named Kip Logan ever attend that high school ? I wanted to find out . Or was the whole business just one elaborate lie , told by somebody I would never see again ? During the drive , all sorts of wild speculations occurred to me . But when I hit Main Street , I realized that I really did n't care if Kip Logan was real . It was still early in the morning . A dusting of fresh snow had fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empty high school and upriver to the equally empty farmstead , parking as close to the starting line as possible . Then I put on the last pair of running shoes that I 'd ever buy , and I fixed a belt around my waist , little bottles full of water and Catorade . I put on the race bib that had been sitting on the car floor for these last months . That might just matter ; who knew ? And with a mangled copy of the unreadable map in my hand , I limped my way to the starting line
