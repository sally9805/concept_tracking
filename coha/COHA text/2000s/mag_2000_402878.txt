It has been with us since Plymouth Colony . But that 's not why it 's an American institution . <p> On a September evening in 1918 , while unpacking an overseas bag for her husband , who had returned from a fact-finding tour of war-torn Europe with double pneumonia , Eleanor Roosevelt came upon a cache of love letters from her social secretary , Lucy Mercer . Later Eleanor would write that the bottom fell out of her world . She did what any high-minded wife would have done at the time : She offered her husband his freedom . Guilty , grief-stricken , but besotted by the lovely Miss Mercer , Franklin accepted his wife 's offer . After six months in Reno , which had recently replaced Sioux Falls , South Dakota , as America 's foremost divorce mill , Eleanor , mindful of the shame and potential scandal that stalked a divorcee , withdrew to a small safe circle of wellborn friends and relatives . Franklin , dismissed from his position by Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels , who had hounded his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina for a similar offense , took the second Mrs. Roosevelt back to Hyde Park . He could not , however , return to his beloved Springwood , overlooking the Hudson ; his mother , who held the purse strings , had disinherited him , as she 'd threatened to do if he disgraced the family with a divorce . He lived out his days in the general vicinity , pursuing a series of agricultural and forestry experiments . Fourteen years later a Depression-wracked nation elected Newton D. Baker its thirty-second President . In the annals of twentieth-century history , Franklin D. Roosevelt merits a brief listing as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under Woodrow Wilson . Eleanor Roosevelt is not mentioned at all . <p> The story is true , up to a point . Eleanor Roosevelt did offer her husband a divorce , but Franklin declined . He loved Lucy , but he ached to be President . " It is better to marry than to burn , " St. Paul said , and opened an alternative path to salvation for those who could not embrace celibacy . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married than to burn . Everyone knew the American people would not elect a divorced man to their highest office . <p> It is hard to believe that a small adjustment between two people or , as is frequently the case , among three , can arouse such passions and alter the course of history . But the powerful emotions divorce stirs grow out of the primitive rusts it seeks to contain . Divorce is society 's attempt to regulate the urge for sex and the desire for property . Small wonder that it inflames ; less that it is always with us . <p> The Romans codified it . The Catholic Church both forbade it and circumvented it with annulment . The Protestant sects fought about it endlessly . " Good God , what a bother these matrimonial cases are to us ! " Martin Luther lamented . Milton , who wrote four tracts on divorce around the time his young wife left him , saw it as a kind of paradise regained . When a couple ceased to love each other , he argued , they were no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no power above their own consent to hinder them from unjoining . " But if divorce germinated in the Old World , it blossomed in the New . <p> In 1639 , while England still ruled marriage indissoluble , the Plymouth Colony granted the first divorce on the new continent , and in the next 60 years the Massachusetts Bay Colony recorded 44 more . By the mid-nineteenth century , other nations saw the American divorce rate , the highest in the world , as a sign of low morals . Canadians despaired of Americans ' absence of restraint , which was " manifested in lynchings and murders " as well as divorce , and one study found that U.S. Mennonites were four times as likely to divorce as their Canadian co-religionists . Could it be something in the water ? <p> Though a spirit of independence had sent the early settlers across an ocean , survival in a vast and unwelcoming continent had required cooperation . The repeated hammering of a husband 's fists , however , or the constant lashing of a wife 's tongue tended to alienate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace , and bigamy led to chaos . Thus , in 1639 , when James Luxford 's wife discovered her husband 's other spouse , the Plymouth Colony not only granted her that first divorce but fined him a hundred pounds , sentenced him to an hour in the stocks on market day , and banished him to England . Throughout the colonial period , alimony would be rare , but fines , whipping , and the stocks were common . <p> One of the Ironies of the period was that divorce was obtainable , if not easy , in Puritan New England but difficult , if not impossible , in the supposedly easygoing South . The difference goes to the heart of the battles swirling around divorce . Was it a legal , moral , or social issue  --  the domain of lawmakers , soul savers , or do-gooders ? <p> The New England colonies viewed marriage , and therefore divorce , as a secular rather than religious rite . The first marriage in the Plymouth Colony , which predated the first divorce by a mere 18 years , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . " The Southern colonies also put marriage in the secular sphere , but when it came to divorce , they clung to the Anglican Church . What God had joined together , albeit through the auspices of the state , no man might put asunder . <p> What the South saw as a solution to the problem of marital discord , the North viewed as a recipe for social disaster . The only evil more disruptive to society than an unhappy marriage was the solitary potential sinner it left in its wake . In many New England communities there were laws against " the solitary vice " of living alone . Massachusetts convicted John Littleale of " laying in a house by himself contrary to the law of the country " and fined Mary Drury for " leaving the fellowship of her husband . " Therefore , certain seventeenth-century settlers , Cotton Mather among them , foreshadowing nineteenth-and twentieth-century sociologists , viewed divorce as a safety valve . In the latter centuries , the emphasis would be on personal fulfillment , in the seventeenth and eighteenth on social cohesiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the common good was clearly new . Divorce would punish and perhaps banish the guilty spouse and set the innocent free to find another provider or helpmeet , and to procreate . The last ranked high among colonial concerns . In 1769 the governor of New York looked longingly at the superior population growth of New England , which had a less restrictive divorce law . <p> The New England colonies were not , however , a hotbed of low morals and lascivious behavior , any more than the South was a haven for happy marriages . When government outlawed divorce , and sometimes even when it did n't , a resourceful people in an infant country found alternatives . Vast spaces , primitive means of communication , and no Social Security numbers made desertion as easy then as no-fault divorce is today . Newspapers ran notices : REWARD  --  RUNAWAY WIFE . Bigamy , the occasional wife sale , and murder were other early do-it-yourself methods of breaking marital bonds . <p> Colonial America was , of course , a crazy quilt ' of laws , and the grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varied from place to place . In Massachusetts Bay after 1629 , if either spouse deserted , the other could sue , but when it came to adultery , only a wife 's transgression provided cause . Mobility made bigamy , like desertion , common , and in 1680 Elizabeth Stevens divorced her husband in the Plymouth Colony for having wives in Boston , Barbados , and an unspecified English village . Most colonies that permitted divorce recognized impotence as just cause , and here the New World took a step toward what might be called the professionalization of divorce . In seeking physiological evidence of nonconsummation , an old English statute appointed " seven honest women " to labor diligently over the accused , but New York required examination by surgeons . <p> As the colonies inched closer to revolution , divorce , once an instrument of cohesion , became an overture to independence . In 1772 Dr. James Blair , whose marriage had never been consummated , retained Thomas Jefferson to represent him in the event that Mrs. Blair sued . Dr. Blair died before any action was brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce foreshadow the document he drafted a few years later to dissolve the colonies ' bonds with Great Britain . " Cruel to continue by violence an union made at first by mutual love , but now dissolved by hatred , " Jefferson wrote . " End of marriage is Propagation &; Happiness . Where can be neither , should be dissolved . " Could the Declaration 's " consent of the governed " and " the Right of the People to alter or abolish " be far behind ? <p> Divorce was not only a prelude to America 's independence but a contributing cause of it . In 1773 the British crown forbade all royal governors to assent to any bills of divorce of " persons joined together in Holy Marriage . " The order was n't as galling as a new tax , but it raised colonial hackles a little higher . In no time , revolution and divorce were on intimate terms . Men and women bringing marital petitions began using terms like tyranny , misrule , injustice , and happiness of the individual . America had discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country expanded . Men , and women , were striking out for new territory . Sometimes a spouse did n't want to go . Individuals were reinventing themselves . Sometimes a husband or wife did n't want to take a spouse along . Cohesion had been necessary in the fledgling colonies , but the Republic was a free and freewheeling nation , dedicated to happiness as well as liberty . <p> Indeed , many who inveighed against the burgeoning divorce rate believed the culprit was the particularly American infatuation with individualism . In 1852 , the New York Tribune editor , Horace Greeley , deplored " the right of every man to do pretty nearly as he pleases " as the chief cause of divorce and warned of " a general profligacy and corruption such as this country has never known . " Moreover , Greeley argued , most married people were happy precisely because they assumed they were bound for life . In other words , it was the scent of freedom that aroused dissatisfaction . <p> Soon , divorce , like every other American institution , came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not officially permitted to marry , there was no need for them to divorce ) but as a metaphor . When word of an unhappy wife 's suicide traveled through Philadelphia in 1788 , an anonymous writer published An Essay on Marriage , in which he cited the new sentiment for freeing slaves and wondered , " where is there any relief to the miserable , hen-pecked husband , or the abused and insulted , despised wife ? " In 1881 The Century Magazine heralded serialization of William Dean Howells 's A Modern Instance , generally regarded as the first serious divorce novel , with comparisons to Uncle Tom 's Cabin , which it had run three decades earlier . When Elizabeth Cady Stanton was n't likening marriage to " legalized prostitution , " she was sprinkling her speeches on divorce with words like slavery , chains , and degradation . In 1884 , she wrote , " Liberal divorce laws for oppressed wives are what Canada was for Southern slaves . " <p> If slavery provided an apt analogy for marriage , race inflamed the issue of divorce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia legislators to enact the state 's first " bill of divorcement . " Thirteen years earlier , John Sewall sued his wife , Eve , after she gave birth to a mulatto child . If that had been the end of the action , it might be a simple case of adultery , but Eve and the child were sold into slavery in accordance with Maryland law . <p> If abolition entered the divorce arguments , so did feminism . By the mid-nineteenth century , when women could both earn wages and legally control them , many feminists saw liberalized divorce as one more step on the road to woman 's full equality . Divorce and feminism were not , however , a match made in heaven . Elizabeth Cady Stanton , who had several lectures in her repertoire , admitted that " women respond to this divorce speech as they never did to suffrage . " The vote might be nice , but it could n't hold a candle to freedom from a husband 's beatings , food for the children , and the certainty that the week 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other feminists , however , feared destroying the family , which they regarded not only as woman 's special realm and responsibility but as the very foundation of civilization . The division went back to the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848 . One supporter of the vote for women complained , " It has been a source of regret to me ever since I joined the Women Suffrage party , that so many advocates of that measure are advocates also of a greater liberty of divorce . " <p> Some suffragists saw an even greater threat . They feared sullying their political purity with the salacious scent of free love . In a thinly disguised 1855 autobiographical novel , titled Mary Lyndon ; or , Revelations of a Life , the spiritualist , reformer , and medical practitioner Mary Gove Nichols portrayed her first husband as a leech who appropriated her income as fast as she earned it . But to The New York Times , the book , which also celebrated Nichols 's fashionable salon and a subsequent love affair with an English spiritualist , was nothing more than an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fornication . " Meanwhile the factions splintered further . Among those who supported liberalized divorce , old-line feminists wanted to free women from the abuses of sex , new moralists for the pleasures of it . <p> The Idea of women carrying on like men tapped into the rich vein of misogyny that so often runs beneath the surface of chivalry . Colonial pamphlets on marital advice warned against man 's enslavement to woman 's sexuality . More than two and a half centuries later , one of the spate of marriage manuals that appeared in the early nineteen hundreds warned against selfish wives who carry the " germ of divorce . " Clearly the rate at which the nation 's marriages were foundering reflected the American woman 's sexual and economic voraciousness . <p> Statistics seemed to substantiate the argument . Historically , women have brought more divorce suits than men , but the main cause of the imbalance was a peculiar gentleman 's agreement . Men would permit women to charge adultery as long as they could go on committing it ; real men were n't subject to mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury of establishing residency elsewhere , while men who were did not . <p> Whichever sex was responsible , by the second half of the nineteenth century , both men and women were clamoring for reform . They banded together in leagues and collected statistics , lobbied for a uniform code , and even talked of a constitutional amendment . The word reform , however , can be misleading . A uniform law did not mean a liberal law . While suffragists were divided on the question of divorce , the General Federation of Women 's Clubs was clearly against it . Its members wanted to protect women rather than emancipate them . The Woman 's Christian Temperance Union , the largest women 's organization in the country , found itself in a particular bind . Opposed to liberalized divorce , it nonetheless fought to extend the grounds to drunkenness . The various Protestant denominations stiffened their positions against the institution , and Theodore Roosevelt raised his shrill voice against it in public and nipped it in the bud at home when he forbade his daughter Alice to bring suit against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where some found moral laxity , others saw economic opportunity . The reformers were up against nothing less than the American entrepreneurial spirit as embodied in the divorce mill . The mill was highly mobile . It moved from Indianapolis in the 1850s , through Utah and the Dakotas , on to the Oklahoma Territory , settled briefly in Wyoming , and in 1910 finally put down roots in Reno . The scenery varied , but the conditions remained the same . The first was a short residency requirement ; the second , " omnibus grounds , " which gave broad definitions to cruelty and incompatibility . Other accommodations and amenities followed . In the 1890s , Sioux Falls , South Dakota , boasted 10 gambling halls , 37 holes-in-the-wall , and 100 prostitutes . Meanwhile , The Nation lamented that at the city 's hotels " a divorced husband may be seen introducing his new wife to his old one , who , in her turn , presents her new husband , while the bewildered children involved in this scandalous mixture wander about in disconsolate uncertainty . " But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reformers persuaded the Nevada legislature to extend the residency requirement to 12 months , but two years later the Reno Businessmen 's Association succeeded in rolling it back , and by 1931 , with Idaho and Arkansas hot on the trail of the divorce dollar , the requirement was down to 6 weeks . <p> The perception of an entire population crisscrossing the country in pursuit of quick and easy divorce was widespread . " I 'll reside in Athens six weeks , while I get me a divorce , " wrote Lorenz Hart in the 1938 musical The Boys From Syracuse . But unlike the men-hating wives and social-climbing home wreckers in The Women , Clare Boothe Luce 's hit play of the same period , few people had the time or money for Pullman fare and several weeks on a dude ranch . The ones who did , however , tended to make headlines . In 1869 , on his way from St. Petersburg to his destiny in Troy , Heinrich Schliemann made a stop in Indianapolis , where he bought a house and a share in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resident and therefore entitled to a speedy divorce . ( From colonial times until well into the nineteenth century , both legislatures and courts granted divorces . ) <p> The mills may not have been undermining personal morals , as the reformers argued , but they were subverting the rule of law . " How intolerable ... that citizens of New York , for example , should be able to set the laws to which they are subject at defiance by temporarily removing to another State , " The Nation scolded in the article cited earlier . The problem was not new . Law and practice had been on uneasy terms ever since the colonies , taking a cue from the mother country , had made divorce an adversarial action . If one unhappy spouse sued , it was legal . If both opted to end the marriage , it was collusion . The result was a nation of pillars of the community , leaders of society , and otherwise honest folk busily breaking the law . In New York , which retained Alexander Hamilton 's 1787 statute designating adultery as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessories to the crime grew up . A 1934 series in the New York Mirror ran under the headline I WAS THE " UNKNOWN BLOND " IN 100 NEW YORK DIVORCES ! A decade and a half later , another newspaper published a feature about a wife and mother of three who moonlighted as an " unknown woman " in staged adulteries all over town . As a result , the district attorney 's office opened 600 recent divorces to review . The number of matrimonial actions in New York County fell by 43 percent the following year . <p> The tabloids ' focus on corespondents reveals a home truth about divorce . The blush of shame it has always worn goes back to the early company it kept with adultery . By the late seventeenth century , fornication had ceased to be a capital offense in most colonies , but it was still seen as the devil 's work , and some warned that a society that failed to punish adultery by death would itself be punished by God . Thus were laid the philosophic grounds for an intrusive priggishness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and amuse the rest of the world . <p> The politics of prudery , and the prudishness of politics , have a long history . In 1828 , when Andrew Jackson ran for the Presidency , a group of moral guardians , who also happened to be his political opponents , dredged up the decades-old circumstances of his marriage and his wife 's previous divorce , which were confusing at best , compromising at worst . Jackson 's enemies charged adultery , living together without benefit of clergy , and bigamy ( though the last two could scarcely have existed simultaneously ) . He " tore from a husband the wife of his bosom , " testified one congressional candidate . BASE , WANTON , AND MALIGNANT FALSEHOOD , shrieked the equally excitable Jacksonian press . True , the scandal grew out of the circumstances of the divorce , rather than the issue of divorce itself , but until no-fault sundering arrived on the scene , and even since it has , the devil has always been in the lurid details . <p> As the country grew , Americans on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before 1900 , no magazine except the radical Arena defended the right to divorce , and fiction was equally recalcitrant . When a divorced man proposes to a respectable woman in an 1865 novel titled Out in the World , by T. S. Arthur , she tells him , " I regard an offer of marriage from you as little better than an insult . " The 1880s and 1890s were a good period for the divorce novel , though few of these were any good by literary standards . Lawyers were typically given names like Mr. Sly , and the repercussions ran to alcoholism , business failure , ill health , and even death . When the literature was actually good , divorce fared better , though the portrayal of public attitude toward it was more scathing . In Edith Wharton 's The Custom of the Country , the heroine who is cavalier about divorce is ironically outwitted by it . But The Age of Innocence paints a chilling picture of a woman imprisoned by society 's prejudice against divorce . <p> Although moving pictures , more democratic mirrors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , they did occasionally give it a fair shake . One study found that of 24 films dealing with divorce in 1931 and 1932 , fully 22 treated it sympathetically . A few years later , in Dodsworth , an underrated gem of American filmmaking , a luminous Mary Astor tells a long-married Walter Huston , " I used to be a British subject by marriage . I do n't know that one can be a British subject by divorce . " Astor 's tone is wistful , but the message is subversive . A divorced woman can make a better helpmate than a long-time wife . <p> Much of the literature on divorce took the form of advice manuals . Even here , the blush of shame would not fade . As late as 1947 , a primer called ABC of Divorce asked such pertinent questions as " Have You Considered the Attitudes of Others ? " and " Where Does the Boss Stand on Divorce ? " and answered , " Prepare to get a mild brush-off from all but your most intimate women friends , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a divorced person is not as steady or satisfactory an employee as a married one . " A decade earlier , Harper 's Monthly ran an article called " Thrice Married , " by Anonymous . Though the writer compared herself to a woman in a similar situation " now so well-known that I need not mention her name , " the fact that Anonymous would identify neither herself nor Wallis Warfield Simpson indicates the aura of disrepute that still clung to divorce , or at least to divorcees . ( While a man is merely divorced , a woman is that racy breed , a divorcee . ) Nonetheless , Anonymous shows a certain swaggering pride at her success in the marriage sweepstakes . " I would rather be envied than pitied . I would rather be judged a hussy than a wife who could n't hold her husband . But the truth is that I have been married three times just because I am not light-minded about marriage . " The last sentence is the giveaway .

The social revolution of the sixties liberalized policy , transformed attitudes , and ushered in no-fault laws . Now when a marriage foundered , there were casualties but no culprit . Greeting-card companies cashed in on the phenomenon : " I 've just heard ... You 're free as a bird . " In the political arena , divorce became an occasion for humor rather than an issue  --  remember the anti-Ronald Reagan buttons suggesting that Jane Wyman was right ?  --  yet the moralists and the policymakers continued to fret . The governor of California cited the " festering problem " of divorce and appointed a committee to find ways to slow the rising rate , resulting in a 1969 law combining no-fault principles with judicial control . The relationship-enhancement movement that began training spouses in marriage " skills " in the fifties has burgeoned into big business . Recently , Arizona and Louisiana instituted the option of " covenant marriage , " which requires the bride and groom to sign a contract permitting divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisonment of a spouse , or long marital separation . We have come full circle to colonial practice , but now spouses , rather than the state or church , are trying to legislate the marital happiness that continues to elude them . <p> America embraced divorce because it believed in marriage . Not marriage as the rest of the world practiced grounded in property rights , arranged by others , maintained in form , degraded in practice  --  but marriage as a lifelong love affair , an endless ride on the roller coaster of romance , an enduring affirmation of the specialness of self as reflected in another 's eyes . In America a happy marriage is every individual 's birthright . We hunger after it ourselves , hope for it for our children , even expect it from our politicians . In 1952 political wisdom predicted Adlai Stevenson could not win the Presidency because he was a divorced man . Stevenson 's marital status never became a campaign issue , possibly because the Republicans believed the Democrats had a copy of a letter citing Dwight Eisenhower 's own intent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic party was sufficiently broadminded to nominate a divorced man twice . In more recent times , as many pundits have noted , it takes a divorced man like Newt Gingrich or Bob Dole to appreciate family values . <p> Perhaps the exercise in what-if history at the beginning of this article got it wrong . Perhaps an America in thrall to the idea of love would have forgiven Franklin Roosevelt and elected him to its highest office . Depressionera audiences flocked to escapist romantic comedies with happy endings . Perhaps Eleanor would have overcome the stigma of divorce , as she conquered so many other prejudices of her time and class , and gone on to fight its injustices . <p> Divorce is an American institution . It was born of a continent 's imperatives and a people 's love of independence and infatuation with individualism . It came of age colored by the problem of slavery and the issue of race . It flourished in our entrepreneurial climate and in spite of our prudishness , or perhaps because of our prurience .

THRALL <p> Although desertion provided adequate grounds for divorce in Connecticut , William Thrall decided to allege adultery as well . Hannah Thrall , who risked losing rights to his substantial property , fought back in kind . For the next several years , members of the tightly knit community of Windsor paraded through an austere New England church giving lurid testimony . Neighbor stopped talking to neighbor , and relative to relative . The court finally refused the divorce on the grounds that a husband whose behavior drives his wife away is himself the deserter . In 1739 William died , leaving Hannah a 36-year-old widow with a hefty nest egg and a flaming past that set the standard for American divorce scandal . 1760 : LUFKIN V. LUFKIN <p> When Stephen Lufkin charged his wife with adultery , and William Haskell testified that he had indeed had sexual relations with Tabitha Lufkin , the court not only granted Lufkin his divorce but also took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he refused her , she would find " Some other Man For She Did not Love her Husband Lufkin . " Since there is no record that either Tabitha or Haskell was punished for the crime of fornication , we can assume that the no-love defense had entered American law . 1849 : BUTLER V. KEMBLE <p> The defendant was Fanny Kemble , the toast of both the British and American stage . The plaintiff was Pierce Butler , of a Philadelphia family that , in former President Martin Van Buren 's words , " for three generations has been the curse of every woman connected with the name . " The celebrity divorce had arrived . Fanny countered her husband 's long list of grievances with a narrative citing a few of his many infidelities ; the judge refused to admit it as evidence , but the press did n't share his scruples , and the newspaper accounts turned the tide of opinion in Fanny 's favor . Fearing that Butler was squandering her daughters ' inheritance , she withdrew her defense and accepted his terms anyway . Settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : FORREST V. FORREST <p> Another well-known actor , Edwin Forrest , drove his lovely British-born wife from his house ( literally , in a carriage ) ; she then sued for divorce , and in an orgy of accusations , friends , acquaintances , and servants lined up to testify . Some said Mr. Forrest frequented houses of ill fame and had been seen leaving his leading lady 's hotel room early one morning . Others swore that in her husband 's absence Mrs. Forrest had turned his home into " a common resort for some of the most notorious roues and libertines of New York . " The jury found him guilty of adultery and awarded her a handsome $3,000 a year . 1869 : MCFARLAND V. MCFARLAND <p> In October 1869 , as the recently divorced Abby Sage McFarland prepared to marry Albert D.

America 's most popular clergyman , Henry Ward Beecher , married the dying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public . Then 2,000 women crowded Apollo Hall in New York to petition the governor to commit the acquitted murderer to an asylum . McFarland , they argued , should be either hospitalized if insane as judged or hanged if not . 1911 : SINCLAIR V. SINCLAIR <p> Upton Sinclair always maintained that he sought no publicity for himself . His wife , Meta , made no such disclaimer . After he had sued her for divorce and named the latest in her long line of lovers as corespondent , she told reporters she was eager to have others learn from her experience . Soon the tabloids were trumpeting the case and Meta 's father was telling the World that his son-in-law was " an unripe persimmon . " Though the scandal made good newspaper copy , Sinclair 's graphic account of watching his wife and her lover couple and then finding solace in another woman 's bed never found a publisher , which clearly contradicts the plus ca change theory of history . 1922 : STILLMAN V. STILLMAN <p> In a suit that packed all the raw kick and unpredictable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National City Bank , charged his wife , Anne , and an Indian guide at their Quebec lodge with adultery . She counterattacked by accusing James of being the father of a former Ziegfeld Follies girl 's illegitimate son . Before long , people began noticing that Anne 's blue-eyed , blond-haired child bore less likeness to the Quebecois guide or her husband than to Fowler McCormick , a teenage grandson of puritanical old John D. Rockefeller . After five years and almost a million dollars , the attorneys negotiated a reconciliation , and the Stillmans lived happily ever after  --  until , a decade and a half later , in a surprise love-conquers-all ending , the 50-year-old Anne divorced James and married 29-year-old Fowler McCormick. 1925 : RHINELANDER V. RHINELANDER <p> Though Leonard Rhinelander grew up in a tony Madison Avenue mansion , he suffered cruelly from his mother 's violent death when he was 14 , his father 's icy arrogance , and his own stutter . No wonder Kip , as he was called , fell immediately in love with the darkly lovely and entirely adoring Alice Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charms of his new daughter-in-law , who 'd once worked in the laundry room of the New York Athletic Club . When the tabloids screamed SOCIALITE MARRIES NEGRESS , the senior Rhinelander sued for an annulment on the grounds that Alice had misled his son . While Rhinelander 's attorneys portrayed Kip as " backward " and " brain-tied , " the Ku Klux Klan burned crosses , politicians squared off in the Senate restaurant , and Calvin Coolidge refused to comment . The jury denied the annulment , but the trial , which featured Alice 's forced disrobing in a New York Supreme Court jury room , was a perfect marriage of national prurience and racial prejudice .

LINDSTROM <p> Ingrid Bergman did n't just deceive a husband and abandon a child ; she betrayed an entire nation , and post-World War II America was not about to let her get away with it .

" Lisa Laszlo could not have said it better . 1982 : PULITZER V. PULITZER <p> Headlines told of sexual high jinks with a trumpet , and the wife 's " first step toward ... autonomy " was to pose for Playboy .
