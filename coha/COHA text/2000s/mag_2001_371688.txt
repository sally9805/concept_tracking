COURTESY CALL In a belated effort to improve relations between cell-phone addicts and the people who sit near them , Nokia has begun a campaign to silence phones during theater performances . Its public-service announcement , which debuted Nov. 3 at a Dallas Opera production of Verdi 's Simon Boccanegra , began with increasingly annoying rings , then urged the audience to switch phones to " vibrate . " It was met with wild applause , and Nokia is now taking its show on the road . <P> FEEL THE BURN Are the VCR 's days numbered ? Pioneer and Philips have introduced the first DVD " burners " to create discs that can be read on most DVD players . Though built using competing technologies , Pioneer 's DVR-7000 and Philips ' DVDR1000 have one thing in common : a daunting $2,000 price tag . <P> LOCATION , LOCATION It 's a great idea : when you get lost in the woods , your cell phone tells you  --  and your rescuers  --  exactly where you are . The FCC now requires carriers to offer a phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PCS is the first wireless service to sell one . Its GPS-equipped SPH-N300 ( $150 ) will go live next week in Rhode Island . By the end of 2002 , all Sprint phones will have GPS capability . <P>  --  By Wilson Rothman
