One of the loudest crashes in the tech collapse came last month , when mighty Cisco Systems found itself with so many of its finished routers and components stuck in warehouses and going nowhere that CEO John Chambers had to take drastic action . He wrote off a record $2.3 billion in inventory , including $900 million in processors and $300 million in semiconductors . Similar liquidations are taking place throughout the electronics industry . And they 're providing fresh opportunities for a small band of nimble souls who are profiting not in spite of the tech slump but precisely because of it . <P> Public-auction websites like eBay are doing a fire-sale business in surplus tech hardware . A new Cisco AS5300 access server with a recommended retail price of $50,000 was auctioned off for less than $2,500 . Even busier these days is Virtual Chip Exchange , a private marketplace for 4,200 established buyers and sellers of computer chips and semiconductors in 40 countries . VCE is currently the planet 's largest electronics B2B exchange , as rated by Jupiter Media Metrix . The privately held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first quarter , up 238% from the same period last year , while profits are in " the high six figures . " <P> The way VCE works is pretty simple : you sign up anonymously with your surplus silicon , set a minimum bid and wait for anonymous buyers anywhere in the world . Deals are done in a matter of minutes . The sold items go for quality control to VCE , which takes an average 9% commission . The sales price and parties ' names are kept private ( sparing further embarrassment to ceos like Chambers ) . <P> With 30,000 suppliers still unsigned by VCE and with worldwide surplus-chip inventories estimated to be worth $30 billion , the company seems poised to take even greater advantage of the network effect . " The potential is huge , " says John McCarthy , an e-business analyst for Forrester Research . Indeed , projections that the semiconductor business will shrink 17% this year seem to be a boon for VCE . <P> The company 's CEO , Mike Wood , is n't troubled by making money off a manufacturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aspirin is not taking advantage of you , " he says . By helping clear excess inventories more quickly , " this kind of service could contribute to a turnaround . " And if it does , Wood is well placed to continue making money during an economic expansion , when higher unit prices for goods sold on his site would offset any decline in excess-inventory volume . <P> In the meantime , any business that 's in the market to upgrade its technology can do so for a fraction of what it would have paid just eight months ago . Robert H. Wager Co. , a firm in Rural Hall , N.C. , that makes high-tech smoke detectors , was days away from defaulting on a $200,000 contract because of a shortage of critical semiconductors . A two-month search turned up one supplier with a 14-day lead time . Five minutes on VCE turned up supplies that could be delivered immediately . " We 're deliriously happy , " says sales director Christine Timchek . Similarly , Texatronics , a contract manufacturer of printed circuit boards in Richardson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VCE . Even troubled Cisco is examining the service .
