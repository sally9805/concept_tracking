<p> Moving pornographic images out of sight can be debated on the merits , but the overwhelming futility of trying looms as large as the Penthouse billboards greeting Denver 's commuters . <p> As state legislators try to dam one stream of pop-culture sex by hiding magazines , videos and books from young eyes , a flood of increasingly pornographic bare skin is rushing into the main channels every day . <p> The opening of the Penthouse Club in Glendale , with its ' skyboxes , ' big-screen sports and stacks of ESPN The Magazine on the coffee tables not reserved for lap dances , is just the latest example of how thick-skinned we 've become about skin . <p> HBO has supplanted the Spice Channel . A homemade hard-core video makes Paris Hilton a network star instead of a pariah . MTV 's website groups videos from teen stars under the porn-ready rubric ' Barely Legal . ' An upscale Denver nightclub displayed lesbian porn as a conversation starter . The latest Britney Spears video , ' Toxic , ' has her tarted up as a flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' mile-high club , ' the latest in a string of pop-porn collaborations that have young female stars playing out fantasies from Catholic schoolgirl to pole dancer . <p> Toss in the Internet , as either the match or the gasoline . Harold Kester 's Web-filtering company tracked 44,000 objectionable sites in 1996 , and now lists 1.5 million just for hard-core sex . With viewers now just a pop-up ad away from perversities that used to be the dankest of secrets , it 's no wonder a California porn entrepreneur 's motto is ' Accessibility leads to acceptability . ' <p> At a time when civic law seems to be tightening - the legislature debates restricting sex imagery while other states consider gay-marriage bans - few civic inhibitions remain . <p> Now a growing number of researchers and social observers want to know what 's next , in both escalation and fallout . Does Showtime have to go bottomless to outdraw the gleeful toplessness of HBO ? Does porn 's pervasiveness prompt husbands to ask their wives for sexual favors once thought the domain of XXX movie sets ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' or wonder , ' Why bother ? ' <p> ' The next thing is to look at the effects of long-term exposure on social and moral judgments and societal values , ' said University of Alabama professor Jennings Bryant , whose communications department has done extensive studies of what porn exposure does to individual attitudes . <p> There 's no point in studies that merely ' take a snapshot ' of the sexualization of all media , he said , because ' we learned what we wanted . a I do n't think there 's any question but that all of mainstream media are getting more explicitly sexual . ' <p> ' Compared to 10 years ago , there is sex everywhere , ' agreed Barbara Coulon , a vice president with the marketing and demographics group Youth Trends in New York . <p> Taboo becomes ' normal ' <p> One clear impact , judging from Youth Trends ' interviews and focus groups , is that a mainstreaming of sex images has shifted many teenagers ' definitions . <p> ' They do n't consider oral sex to be sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be real sex , whereas oral sex is not considered ' going all the way . " <p> Yet there is no obvious mudslide of morality when other researchers take on the question . <p> Since 1991 , a steadily declining percentage of American teens have had intercourse , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation , one of the few organizations that does consistent surveying on the issue . The number of teenagers reporting multiple partners also is on the decline . Of those who are having sex , more are using contraceptives , helping to lower the teenage pregnancy rate from 116.5 per 1,000 girls in 1991 to 94.3 in 1997 , and researchers believe the trend has continued since then . <p> Judging from her conversations , Coulon says , the two patterns - more teen sexuality , less teen sex - are not contradictory but logical . <p> ' It used to be shrouded in such secrecy , and shrouding it in secrecy made it more alluring to experiment , ' she said . ' They have more of a choice now than previous generations did , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on adults , though , who pursue endless variety to stay interested , may be less innocuous . <p> ' People who are heavy consumers of pornography have shifting perceptions of what 's normal , ' Bryant said . ' They get a sex-calloused attitude , and the idea that anyone would really say no is bogus . ' <p> His scientific conclusions have made it to the pop-culture echo chamber , when the men on an episode of ' Friends ' mistakenly received free access to a porn channel , then were stunned to find that female strangers would n't disrobe on first sight . <p> The men in Bryant 's studies who were exposed to more porn sought more extreme variations when given the choice , tended to have less severe recommendations for rape punishment , and showed less desire to have children while seeking more extramarital relationships , Bryant said . He added that he and his colleagues were ' surprised ' at the consistency of the responses . <p> ' The results are pretty uniform , and have been aggregated by so many investigators who ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A breach from reality <p> Broomfield counselor Robert Whitman , who specializes in relationships and addictions , said he sees more men every year who have been replacing wives and girlfriends with pornography . Women see the use of pornography as an infidelity , while the men start expecting in real life what they 've seen in pornography and , when turned down , delve deeper into pornography . <p> ' It might be titillating at first , but over time it 's usually expressed as more objectification , ' Whitman said . ' And when that emotional connection breaks down , the sex usually falls off . Buy a new car , and it 's exciting for a while , and then it 's just a car . Usually , bigger and more extreme efforts have to follow . ' <p> Pursuit of the next bare thing led to the Penthouse Club 's opening Tuesday in Glendale . The magazine itself , once known as a more explicit alternative to Playboy , went into bankruptcy after being overtaken by the Internet and an explosion in triple-X videos and DVDs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to executives and middle-class men who see stripping as just one entertainment in a full life of sports , business and consumer goods . <p> ' I consider us a psychological relaxation center for men , ' said Troy Lowrie , chairman of the publicly traded company that runs Penthouse and other national clubs . <p> Yet the escalation is there , too , literally halfway up the staircase near the bar . On the landing , where a bouncer takes away all alcohol to comply with Glendale rules , the G-strings give way to an all-nude show of the kind that used to be reserved for the seediest clubs . <p> Again , the media chamber echoes : Club spokesman John Soto Jr . notes that the images of strip clubs have morphed much like the woman in the recent tourism ads for Las Vegas - she enters a limo looking like an exotic dancer and emerges at the airport in a business suit . <p> ' I think we 're part of that evolution , ' Soto said . And he means it personally - until recently , Soto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' People say to me , ' What are you doing ? ' A year and a half ago , I was working on a new swing set for the Barnum playground . ' <p> How much more explicit can mainstream culture get ? <p> A HarperCollins division will soon publish a book by triple-X doyenne Jenna Jameson , who has been on view in New York 's Times Square on a massive billboard . The same Regan Books imprint will also publish ' How to Have a XXX Sex Life ' by a bevy of stars from Vivid Entertainment , a corporate conglomerate of video porn . <p> Middlebrow Hollywood producer Brian Grazer , partner of Ron Howard , is finishing a documentary about the pervasive influence of the once-vilified porn groundbreaker ' Deep Throat . ' In March , Twentieth Century Fox will release ' The Girl Next Door , ' in which the nice guy gets the former porn star and lives happily ever after . <p> Critics say the ' corporatization ' of porn drives ever forward , with national cable , satellite and broadcast companies taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forbes magazine effort to pinpoint the economics of porn set total revenues between $ 2.6 billion and $ 3.9 billion a year . <p> While Whitman tells his individual clients they can certainly step backward from the edge of porn - turn it off , talk to a partner , have more cuddling and sex at home - he 's not sure how society in general would back away from porn , or whether it should . <p> " Sex is such a big part of a relationship and such a big part of our lives that availability of pornography becomes seductive . I do n't think it 's spontaneously going to cure itself , " he said . " Prohibition did n't work very well . It just made alcohol all the more attractive . "
