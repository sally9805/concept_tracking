Chapter One The afternoon started like any other afternoon . The first Tuesday of October was a solid , bright school day and , outside on the school steps , the sun fell across everyone 's arms like a warm shawl . The glare on Lydia 's desk had veered to the left along the windowsill . She knew it was after two p.m. , yes , because the shadows of the sumac stalks outside all bent toward the east . Lydia Porter had been in her cubicle at Shadrach High School ever since the second lunch bell . She still had three months to work on this Missouri standards-test schedule , and it would take her that long to figure it out . If the juniors and seniors tested upstairs , she 'd been thinking , the sophomores could take over B-hall downstairs . But that would leave a quarter of this year 's freshmen wandering around A-hall after third period with nothing to do . Her biggest challenge every year , this test schedule . She propped her chin in her palm and stared at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counseling office door . " Come in . " The door opened five inches and a teenager 's head appeared in the crack . Amazing how the young ladies always acted so hesitant , when the boys just burst in . A little wave , an uncertain smile . " Miss P ? " " Hey , Shelby . How are you ? " For the moment , the teenager left the door open behind her . Halls that in nine minutes would be coursing with students-friends shouting , conversation rising- stood empty . Rows of beige metal lockers waited , closed . Except for the hum of incandescent lights in the ceiling and the far , muted voice of someone 's emphatic lecture in a classroom , the building was quiet . " I 'm ... I 'm okay . Well , I guess . " Lydia 's chair rolled over the plastic floor mat with a welcoming clatter . " So , how 's that leg ? " Shelby had gotten hurt tripping up the goalie from Osceola in the third game of the season . Since then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle and sweet girl , she 'd been getting downright mean on the soccer field . " It 's getting better . " " That 's good . " " Yeah . " A pause , while they studied each other . " Miss P ? You got a minute ? " " Sure I do . Come on in . What 's up ? " " I was hoping ... maybe ... we could talk . " " I 'd love to . " In Shelby came , her messy bun sprouting from her crown like a rhododendron and her sunglasses perched high atop her head . She pulled up a chair , adjusted her tiny skirt , and sat . She stayed a good minute with her knees together and her feet splayed apart , her clog-toes tapping the ground . She fiddled with the engraved nameplate on Lydia 's desk that read , " Miss Porter . School-to-Careers Counselor . " " So , " Lydia asked in a light voice , slapping her legs with her hands , settling in . " You been thinking about colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shelby Tatum was one of Lydia 's favorites . She was one of those lucky kids whose mother showed up at every parent/teacher conference , giving proof to their favorite dictum in this office : the parents who showed up at teacher 's conferences were seldom the parents who needed to . Recently , Shelby 's grandfather had sold an old house down in Barry County and her parents had let him build a guesthouse on their property . Such a blessing ; most kids never even got to know their grandfathers . And Shelby 's stepdad parked himself on the sidelines of every soccer game , roaring his approval of her team . Every week he 'd be there with his golf umbrella , a folding chair , and a dilapidated briefcase as wide as a corn-fed piglet , filled with documents from Place-Perfect Missouri Real Estate , where he worked . So college was n't the right button to push . Well , she was only a sophomore . Lydia probed a little further . " Your classes coming along okay ? " " Yeah , " the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shelby had sealed Lydia 's admiration by launching into those loose , comfortable conversations in the hall . Not the way adults launched into them , mind you , but the way only a sixteen-year-old would do it : stony silent if you dared ask questions , burbling torrents of information when you least expected it . That 's why it seemed odd today , after the door shut quietly behind them , that Shelby did n't have anything to say . Lydia 's pointed questions , Shelby 's short , vague answers , fizzled into silence . A heavy breath lifted Shelby 's breastbone and set it down again . Her eyes had taken on an unfathomable hue , a darkness that made Lydia lean forward . No , I can see . It 's more troubling than school stuff . She waited for Shelby to volunteer something . She knew she had to be willing to wait . This girl who normally gestured largely to her friends in the hallway , who slumped against her locker chattering on her cell phone , now sat with her chin against her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hiding her face . As she studied her , Lydia noticed the swollen eyes , the smudges beneath them as dark as slashes of purple lipstick . She had never seen Shelby this distressed . Oh my . Lydia felt a draw toward the girl so strong and natural that it might have been a tide in the ocean or the pull of the moon . She cared so much about all of them , especially the discomfited ones-the ones who had pushed boundaries a little too hard , the ones broken and flailing out against people , who did n't understand how worthy they were . A sense of warm purpose welled in her bosom . How she longed to touch these kids with her heart , to share with them real tools for living instead of the slick pages of college catalogs . It 's the future you see in this place , never the present , Lydia thought . Never the present , until a worried student comes walking in the door . Now that Lydia thought about it , she remembered Amy Mera mentioning that Shelby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . She had n't finished a French II assignment , either . So she asked , " You 've been having trouble keeping up in class ? " Besides soccer , Shelby sang in honor choir , had been picked to be on the mock trial team , and came early for meetings of the student council . And , as everyone knew , the good kids could get way too busy . Shelby had kept her backpack slung by one strap over her shoulder . Now , she let it slip to the floor between her legs . " If I had problems in one of my classes , " she asked as she replaced Lydia 's nameplate on the desk and reached for a paperclip instead , " could you help me ? " " Of course I could . We could get you into a study hall fifth period . We could find you a tutor for French II if you needed it . " " That 's all it would take to get you to help me with something , Miss P ? To tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to tell you about it , " Shelby said , " because you 're the only one I can talk to . " Lydia nodded , waited . " You 're the only one who 's really listened to me for a long time . " Lydia waited some more . " Well . " Shelby 's fingernails , painted a Glamour-magazine buff , had been chewed on . With them , she bent the paperclip into the shape of an elongated S and dropped it on the desktop . " Really , it 's nothing . " " It is that , then ? Do you need a tutor ? " They listened to each other breathing for a while . " No , it is n't that , either . " Another dead end . Well , Lydia knew how to find her way around dead ends . She began to try a little harder . " Things okay with your peers ? Everything okay between you and your friends ? " " Yeah . " The girl cocked her head . " Everything 's fine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment the door burst open and in barreled three uninvited boys . " Hey , Miss P , " Tommy Ballard announced as the door hit the wall . " My mom said I was supposed to stop by here and pick up something . " " Tommy- " " Do n't remember what it was , though . " Lydia resented the interruption , but tried to sound reasonable . " Are you going to be out ? Homework , maybe ? " " No . Something else . " " You know the rules around here , do n't you ? When you come into this office , you 're supposed to knock . We were talking . " " Oh . " Lydia saw Tommy glance with interest at Shelby . " Sorry . " Shelby surveyed the weave of the industrial carpet beside her left clog as if it were the most intriguing pattern she 'd ever laid eyes on . She looked like she wanted to disappear into thin air . " What are you doing in here , Shelb ? " " None of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh . " He snapped his fingers . " I know what I needed . Is this where we get those SAT sign-up things ? " " Over there . " " Thanks . " In the same way they 'd burst in with no regard , the boys overzealously helped themselves to what they needed . They started out before Lydia finished . " And this is the book of sample questions on the test , " she called as she held out another pamphlet . " You boys knock next time . " Tommy seized the booklet from her hand , rolled it inside his palm , and smacked the doorjamb with it . " See you , Shelb . " He led his tribe of friends out the door . Wordlessly , they watched Tommy Ballard go . Lydia readjusted herself , settled in the chair . Shelby played with a buckle on her backpack . Lydia tried again after the silence seemed like it had gone on forever . " You did n't answer my question , Shelby . Is everything okay at home ? " Shelby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back against her shoulder and then fell forward again . Her shoulders slumped against the back of the chair . Lydia saw her slight hesitation . The girl 's lips parted as if she wanted to say something . Then they shut again . Shelby grappled on the floor for her backpack . " I 've got to go . " Lydia could n't lose her now . If she did , Shelby might be gone completely . She might disappear into the river of students that coursed toward their next classes when the bell rang . With a sinking heart , she tacked a different direction , broaching the subject the way someone would check a tender bruise . " You 're frightened . I can tell that much . " " Why do you say that ? " " Because you want to run away . " " I-I ca n't do this . " " But you 're here . You came because you wanted to talk . " The girl rose , upsetting the nameplate on the desk . " I said I 've got to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm and grabbed her , but did n't rise . To rise would have meant concession , and she would n't do that . " It does n't matter . " " It does . " Silence . " Sit down . " " I ca n't do it . " Lydia searched her mind for something , anything , that might change the girl 's decision to leave . " Do n't let Tommy Ballard mess this up . " They stared each other down . At last , Shelby plopped back into the chair and dropped her backpack again . " Okay , " Lydia said . " Let 's start over . " Outside the counseling-office window , a sprinkler kicked out its traveling arc of water over grass that looked as shorn and sun cured as a drill sergeant 's haircut . The letter board proclaimed in four-inch red-and-blue capitals GO FIRE-RATTLERS ! 1999 MISSOURI STATE CLASS 2A CHAMPS . Underneath , smaller type declared Homecoming Dance , Oct. 10 , A Night To Remember . " It 's hard , you know . " " Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably a way to make it right . " " Not this . " " Try me . " " Sometimes there 's things that are just ... impossible to tell . " Folks in St. Clair County , Missouri , liked to say that Lydia Porter had once had a gift . When she 'd been a little girl , she 'd been able to take her father 's hand , lead him into the hill country , and find deer hunters who had lost their way . They 'd written up a story about her in the weekly Shadrach Democrat Reflex when she 'd been ten and her father had brought her here to visit her Uncle Cy- the year Eddy Sandlin had turned up missing during Cub Scout Troup 517 's day hike . She 'd helped find him sitting on a beaver dam in Yesterday Creek , snagging driftwood with his feet . They said she did it by listening to the trees . They said she walked along through the forest at the edge of town , guiding her way through the dusk , touching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hickory and the smooth , overlapping blue-gray mottles of the sycamore , listening . Letting something bigger than herself guide her , thinking maybe it could be the Lord who whispered to her . For a long time , she 'd been willing to hear Him with an innocent child 's ears . They said she heard things that grownups would n't let themselves hear anymore . But that sort of thing had n't happened to Lydia Porter in a very long time . Except for the yellowed newspaper clipping her mother kept pressed in the family scrapbook between faded Polaroids of Border collie pups and her first communion , Lydia could hardly even remember . Lydia had learned to rely on other things now . She relied on asking the right questions . And so she kept asking questions now . " If there is n't something wrong at home , is it anything to do with the boys ? " A bloom of color burned Shelby 's cheeks . Lydia knew she was on to something . She tried to see into the girl 's downcast eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl clenched her fist in her lap . " No . " Then she unclenched it again . " Maybe . " Tears glossed her waxy lashes . One escaped and ran down , leaving behind a track of eyeliner . " I keep thinking maybe it 's something I 've done . Maybe it 's something I 've said to him to make him think- " Lydia watched Shelby try to focus her attention anywhere but on a counselor 's face . She watched her stare at the square letters on the sign beside the desk that read LACK OF PLANNING ON YOUR PART DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN EMERGENCY ON MY PART . She watched her play with the tiny gold promise ring on her left hand , with its almost-invisible diamond chip . She watched her snuffle and wipe her nose on the back of her wrist . " Well , " Shelby said at last , " you know there 's Sam Leavitt . " In distress , she stopped and began to wiggle the ring back and forth until the tiny stone captured a prism of sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bug against the wall . " You want to finish that sentence ? " " I 'm in family science this semester , you know . " " I know . " " W-we talked about abstinence , how it was the best thing to do to keep your body healthy , to be pure . We talked about signing a contract . " A tear fell onto Shelby 's hands . Another onto her jeans . Then another , leaving wet splotches on her denim the size of nickels . " See , I told you there was n't anything anybody could do . " " That contract makes you uncomfortable ? " " I c-ca n't sign something like that . Not after what's- " The girl tucked her elbows hard against her ribcage and moaned . " Sam would n't ever want somebody like m-me . " Instinctively , Lydia moved toward her . She was caught off guard by the flare of terror in Shelby 's eyes . Shelby tucked up her body to protect herself , warding Lydia off with her hands . Lydia was stunned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk . " You ca n't think that about yourself . Why would you ? " Their eyes met . Continues ...
