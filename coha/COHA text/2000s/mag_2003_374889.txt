On the Road to Death at Najaf NAJAF JIM LACEY <P> The 2nd brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division planned to halt west of Najaf , about 100 miles south of Baghdad ; it also planned on facing some resistance from local irregulars . What it did n't expect was a rush-hour-like Iraqi attack , the road dense with enemy trucks bearing down on the brigade . " My headquarters had just rolled into the objective area when 10 pickup trucks loaded with men firing machine guns and RPG-7s came racing down the road , " recalls Colonel David Perkins , commander of the 2nd Brigade . " My lead tanks blew up the first three vehicles , but the rest kept coming . " <P> For hours , the Iraqis continued this furious drag race  --  floor it and fire  --  whipping down the road from Najaf into the waiting guns of the 2nd Brigade 's M1 Abrams tanks . The M1s obliterated them . Says Perkins : " I did n't expect this many of them , but all that meant was we used up more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it means not fighting these guys in Baghdad . " <P> Iraqi irregulars have tried everything to get at 2nd Brigade soldiers . When two Bradley fighting vehicles got stuck in the mud , dozens of irregulars , armed with a machine gun , tow missiles and a chain-firing cannon , tried to crawl up to them . Another group attempted to paddle across the Euphrates river , shooting RPGs as they approached . Their five boats were blown apart on the water . All of these attacks ended similarly . " It 's not a fair fight , " says Major Kevin Dunlop . " Trucks with machine guns against tanks and Bradleys can only have one outcome . We are slaughtering them . " <P> On the other side of the Euphrates , east of Najaf , the 7th Cavalry ran into an even bigger fight . This time the main attack came during a swirling dust storm that made thermal night sights useless . Iraqi irregulars swarmed around the U.S. forces . The Americans were ordered to stay put and shoot at anything that moved . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blasted from behind  --  their most vulnerable spot  --  by antiaircraft guns mounted on pickups . Because of the M1 's unique armor , no one on either tank was injured . And one of the tanks is recoverable . <P> The next rush-hour attack came right after dark the next day , but by this time the 2nd Brigade had set up " toll-booths "  --  heavy armor  --  on the roads leading from Najaf . " They attacked like morons , " says Perkins . " But they kept coming . " In one area guarded by two Bradleys , several hundred Iraqis were killed , according to the local battalion headquarters . <P> Civilians , meanwhile , continually wandered out of town to encourage and even beg the U.S. soldiers to take Najaf . They said fedayeen irregulars were forcing local members of the al-Quds militia to fight by gathering their families and threatening to shoot them if they did not oppose the Americans . At one point , locals came out to thank the Americans for killing the area 's Baath party leader , who they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said , had been killed in an air strike on a fedayeen stronghold .
