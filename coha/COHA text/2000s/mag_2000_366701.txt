When I was a kid , everybody smoked , not only astronauts and game-show hosts but moms and dads , grandparents and your second-grade teacher . ( Who can forget that first glimpse into the smoke-engulfed teachers ' lounge ? ) Smoking was promoted as being cool and grownup . It was what people in the movies did after sex , for instance . <P> We 're supposed to know better now . Tobacco use kills more than 400,000 people a year . So why do more and more kids light up ? <P> The latest statistics show that more than 1 in 3 adolescents is a daily smoker , an increase of 50% in the past decade , and much higher than the smoking rate of 1 in 4 among today 's adults .

Not even ads trumpeting the risks of impotence from smoking have much effect on hormone-crazed 14-year-old boys . Besides , the tobacco industry has subtly and successfully portrayed smoking  --  in the face of known health dangers and parental disapproval  --  as defiant and therefore cool . <P> Big Tobacco 's marketing success , however , is now being turned against it in a way that gives parents new hope . Researchers at the University of Massachusetts studied teens over a period of five years as the state tested a new , edgy antismoking media blitz . The ads were designed not to educate teens about the health risks of smoking ( they already know about that ) but instead to show them that there is another group of powerful adults , in addition to their parents and teachers , that is trying to tell teens what to think about tobacco . These ads give kids a look at the cynical manipulation behind the targeting of teens by tobacco-marketing campaigns . Kids who saw these ads in Massachusetts were half as likely to smoke as others their age .
