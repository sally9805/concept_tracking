The phone rang but it was Mel , and Sara had no intention of talking to Mel . She relaxed and sank deeper into the steaming water of the bath . Candles flickered on the side of the tub . Pachelbel 's " Canon " played softly in the background . Mel had called twice before and Sara had n't answered either time . They had grown up together in tiny Howard 's Mill , Tennessee , and had once been as close as sisters , but that was long ago . They still exchanged Christmas cards and the occasional e- mail , but they had n't actually spoken for nearly twelve years , not since Sara 's daughter Nicky was born . Besides , Sara knew why Mel was calling . <br> Lola had reached her two days ago and in her drawling Alabama accent had invited her for a beach trip . " At my new beach cottage ! For a week ! No husbands or kids ! Just the four of us together again for the first time since college . Annie says she 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Lola had sounded even more spaced out than usual . She kept referring to her beach house as a " cottage " when everyone knew it was a beachfront palace on exclusive Whale Head Island in North Carolina . Lola 's husband , Briggs , had made a fortune by investing in a little start- up called the Home Shopping Channel . <br> " I 'll think about it , " Sara had said , knowing full well that she had no intention of going . She had n't even bothered mentioning it to Tom , although she was sure he 'd tell her to go ahead , he 'd take care of the kids . <br> The phone rang again . Sara sighed and checked the caller ID . It was an unknown cell number and she frowned , knowing that sometimes Nicky forgot her cell phone and used a friend 's to call home . She hesitated and then sat up to answer it . <br> " Okay , fly , why are you ducking my calls ? " Mel asked . Fly . It was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as kids . A fly was someone who ate shit and bothered people . <br> " I 'm not , fly . " <br> " Liar . " <br> Sara sank down into the tub , flicking the stream of water with her toes . It did n't matter how many years had passed , it did n't matter how much heartache and disappointment had passed between them , she would always feel like she was ten years old when she talked to Mel . " I have n't talked to you in nearly twelve years and the first thing you do is call me a liar . " <br> " Why is that ? " Mel said , lapsing into a Southern accent . " That we have n't talked in twelve years , I mean . " <br> " Because you never call me . " <br> " You never call me . " <br> " Well , I guess we 're even then . " Sara turned the faucet down to a trickle and sank deeper into the steaming water . <br> " Hey , I was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The trip to London . The one you never showed up for . " <br> This was meant to make her feel guilty so Sara ignored it . She could hear loud music in the background , some kind of blues standard . " It 's a little early for happy hour , is n't it ? " <br> " It 's never too early for happy hour . You used to know that . Before you became a Republican . Before you became a Volvo- driving soccer mom . " <br> " I would have called you back . Eventually . And do n't call me a soccer mom . " <br> " I suppose you 'll use them as an excuse to not go on the beach trip . The hubby and kids , I mean . " Mel 's voice had an edge to it despite her attempt at good humor . <br> " No , it 's not them , " Sara said quickly . " It 's just , I 'm really busy at work . I 've got a big case coming up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnership had broken up last year and most of her former partners had ended up at various law firms around Atlanta . Sara , though , had decided to drop back to part- time and had taken a job as a child advocate for the Fulton County court system . <br> " That 's funny , " Mel said . " Lola said you 'd left the firm and dropped back to part- time . " <br> Damn Lola . You never could be sure what she actually picked up when you talked to her . Was it all in one ear and out the other , or did something actually stick ? Apparently , Sara 's news about becoming a part- time lawyer had stuck . <br> " How 's the new book coming along ? " Sara asked . <br> " Do n't change the subject . " Mel had written a series of novels about a tough- talking Staten Island private investigator named Flynn Mendez . <br> " Did you read the last one , I 'll Sleep When You 're Dead ? " <br> " Actually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired of seeing myself as the villain . " <br> " Now you 're being paranoid . " <br> " Okay , sure . " <br> " Maybe you have a guilty conscience . " <br> Sara pretended she had n't heard that last part . Tom 's class ended at 3:30 today so he 'd be picking Nicky and Adam up at school and taking them out to dinner . It was her day to do whatever she wanted . She could lie in the bathtub until her skin wrinkled or drink herself into a martini- fueled stupor . Or both . <br> " Let me guess , " Mel said . " You 're in the bathtub . Mozart is playing on the CD player . There are candles flickering everywhere . " <br> Sara turned off the water . " Actually , Pachelbel is playing , " she said . <br> " Mozart comes later . " <br> " Just like in college . Always using up the hot water so nobody else has a chance to shower . " <br> " I do n't remember you being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Very funny . So come on . Will you go on the beach trip or will you wuss out like always ? You know Lola has a boat . Maybe we can do some deep- sea fishing . " Her voice held a clear challenge . No one had ever accused Mel of being subtle . <br> Sara put her head back and stared at the ceiling . " I 'll think about it . " <br> " You 'll think about it ? What 's the matter  --  are you afraid I 'll push you overboard ? " <br> " The thought has occurred to me . " <br> Mel laughed . " Water under the bridge , " she said . <br> She was still laughing when she hung up . Outside the window the gray Manhattan skyline rose against a pewter sky . Gray . Everywhere she looked . No wonder depression was rampant in this city . No wonder everyone was in therapy . She went to the kitchen and made herself a shaker of Cosmopolitans , thinking how good it had been to hear Sara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York but there was something special about that childhood best friend , that person who 'd known you before you could tie your shoes , who 'd suffered with you through the awkward agony of adolescence . They were still friends despite the different paths their lives had taken . Despite everything that had happened between them . <br> The truth of the matter was , Mel was looking forward to the beach trip . It would be nice to head South again , to be in a place where the sun shone most of the time and life moved as slowly as people talked . She had n't been South since her last book tour , and that had been hurried and hectic except for the week she 'd spent with Lola in her rambling mansion in Birmingham . The sun and the surf and the slow- moving lifestyle would be good for her depression . It would be just the thing to lift her out of the funk that always befell her when she was between books and between boyfriends . <br> It would be good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together for the first time in twenty- three years . Four girls who could n't have been any more different . Annie , private and reserved , the roommate who 'd been most likely to get up in the middle of the night and polish the toaster . And Lola , sweet Lola , who had the bland , pretty face of a doll and a mind to match . Depending on her mood , she could be either charmingly funny or so vague you could n't understand a word she said . <br> And Sara would be there this time . Mel had thrown down the gauntlet and Sara had picked it up , just like when they were kids . Mel grinned , thinking about that . <br> Stevie Ray Vaughan finished playing on the CD player . She glanced at the clock and then poured herself a Cosmopolitan . She had a date tonight with Jed Ford , an editor at The New Yorker . She had met him a few weeks ago at a Black &amp; White book party at L&amp;M and for a while it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for to fill the void in her love life . But then last night the inevitable had happened , just as it always did when her love life looked like it might be headed for tranquil seas . She had dreamed of J.T. Radford . <br> The dream contained one of those orgasms that seemed to go on forever . She spent the whole day thinking about it . It was pathetic that her adult life had been spent vainly trying to recapture the intense sexual relationship she 'd once shared with her college boyfriend . The J.T. dreams came less frequently now than they used to , but they still left her with a vague sense of longing and regret and the depressing certainty that whoever the man in her life was right now , he could never be J.T. She wondered if he ever dreamed of her . <br> But this was fruitless thinking , she knew , and dangerous so close to the beach trip . She would make a conscious effort not to think of him again . What was it she had said to Sara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on her hands and knees cleaning the refrigerator grille with a toothbrush . She had told her housecleaner , Waydean , to do it but Waydean was sick and had sent her daughter , Clovis , instead . Waydean had worked for Annie for nearly fifteen years and she knew the way Annie liked things done , but Clovis was always in a hurry and did n't pay attention to details . And it was the details that mattered most to Annie . <br> She was down on her knees and elbows with her ass stuck up in the air . She finished the top row of grillwork and then moved on to the second row , trying not to imagine what she must look like in her Ann Taylor suit , Padovan pumps , and rubber gloves , groveling on the floor like a supplicant at the throne of Genghis Khan . She had n't planned on cleaning the refrigerator grille . She 'd come in from a meeting of her garden club and had noticed a line of hairy dust balls , which Clovis had obviously missed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been more than Annie could bear . She put her purse down and went to work . She tried not to imagine what her garden club would say if they could see her now . They had given her the black rubber gloves with the faux diamond ring and the frilly polka-dot fringe that she was wearing as a joke , but she imagined that they would n't laugh if they could see her now . They would just think it was sad . <br> Annie flushed and wielded her toothbrush with renewed vigor . Why should she have to apologize for liking her life clean and orderly ? Why should she feel guilty for preferring routine and discipline ? <br> She had once overheard one of the younger moms at her sons ' school refer to her as that OCD room mother with the two- by- four stuck up her ass . And this simply because Annie had sent home notes asking that all mothers send in homemade treats for snack time and not store- bought , cellophane- wrapped treats loaded with preservatives and carcinogenic food dyes . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or peanut oil . Or any kind of tropical fruit . Or nuts . <br> You 'd have thought she 'd asked for the still- beating hearts of their firstborn children for all the furor it caused . After that the other moms would watch her nervously when she came into the school . They called her Q- Tip . Q- Tip 's in the house , they 'd say , giggling , or You better run that by Q- Tip before you hand it out . Although why they called her Q- Tip , Annie was unsure , unless it was because she had short , prematurely white hair and walked with the ramrod-straight posture Southern girls of her generation had been taught to use . Annie was pretty sure the nickname had a lot to do with that woman who 'd first called her an OCD room mother . She got even with her . She had her assigned to the calling- for- pledges committee for the annual school fund- raiser . <br> Annie finished the second row and started in on the third . Mitchell was home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him moving around in the den . The boys had always been sweet when they were sick and she had hovered over them anxiously , but Mitchell 's illnesses irritated her beyond words . Especially the kidney stones . There must be something he was eating or drinking , or not eating or drinking , that was causing them . Annie figured anyone else would have gone through that first kidney stone and then figured out some way to keep from getting another one . <br> She sat back on her heels and looked around the gleaming kitchen . The boys were grown and away at college now , and it was just her and Mitchell rambling around in this big old house , but she would n't have traded it for the world . Her dream house . As a girl she 'd grown up in a small cottage in East Nashville , long before the area became fashionable with writers , artists , and musicians . On Sunday afternoons she would go for drives in the country with her parents to see the mansions and sprawling estates of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger she would say gravely , " I 'm gon na have me a house like that one day . " Her parents thought it was cute . <br> And now here she was . True , the house was n't as big as their neighbor , Alan Jackson 's , and they only had fifty acres instead of several hundred , but there was a pool out back and a guest house , and more bedrooms than she and Mitchell and the boys had ever needed . Not that they were as wealthy as Lola and Briggs Furman , of course , but their Cluck- in- a- Bucket chicken franchise had done pretty well . They had stores all over the southeast , a Cluck- in- a- Bucket empire stretching from Miami to Little Rock , Arkansas . <br> No , she 'd done pretty well in life for an East Nashville girl . And she 'd done it by careful planning and by setting her goals out clearly in front of herself . Once she set her sights on something , Annie never wavered . Except for that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried never to think about , she had never been a spontaneous person . At twelve she 'd been dragged to a Wednesday night fish fry at church and had listened as a blond- haired , blue- eyed fourteen- year- old named Mitchell Stites belted out " Lord , You Are My Fortress in a Time of Trouble . " The following Wednesday night , she was waiting in the car when her parents came out to drive to church . " Why , Anne Louise , " her mother asked in surprise , " have you found religion ? " <br> " What she 's found , " her father said , winking , " is Preston Stites 's boy . " <br> " The one with the harelip ? " <br> " No . The other one , who sings in the choir . " <br> The next week Annie invited him to come over to listen to music . Their house was small and lacked privacy but Mitchell was from a good , Godfearing family so Annie 's mother allowed them to go back to her bedroom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coke and a plate of cookies . Mitchell sat on the floor and looked around in wonder and amazement at her room . Stiffly starched curtains hung in front of the spotless windows . Jefferson Airplane played on the record player . <br> " How come all your Barbie dolls are still in their boxes ? " he asked . She had them neatly categorized by date of purchase and stacked on shelves beside a couple of open- faced fruit crates she had painted pink . Their tiny clothes were ironed and hanging on tiny hangers , arranged by seasons of the year , with the tiny shoes sorted in rows underneath . <br> " They stay cleaner that way , " she said . <br> He smiled and looked at her in wonder and admiration . " You sure are a funny girl . I do n't think I 've ever met anyone like you . " <br> " You 'll need a coaster for that drink , " she said . <br> Annie finished cleaning the refrigerator grille and then sat back to admire her handiwork , pulling off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lick it , not that she would , of course , but it was comforting to know that she could . If she had to . <br> She could hear Mitchell breathing in the den . With each out breath he wheezed like an old generator . Not that he was in any pain ; he 'd taken enough OxyContin to bring down an elephant . He just liked the drama of being an invalid . <br> " Hon ? " he called . When she did n't answer he said louder , " Honey , can you make me a sandwich ? " <br> " I 'm busy right now . I 'm cleaning the kitchen . " <br> " You cleaned the kitchen an hour ago . " <br> " I 'm busy . " <br> " Okay , " he said cheerfully . " I 'll just come in there and make myself a sandwich . I 'll just come in there and make my own big mess . " <br> Annie stood up quickly . " I 'll get it , " she shouted . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could feel him smiling from the other room . Damn . She needed a break . She needed to get away from her life if only for a week . This beach trip would be just the thing . And she was looking forward to seeing Lola , Mel , and Sara again , to being with friends who knew her from before her Q- Tip days . Lola had promised Annie her own bedroom , and Annie had eagerly jumped at the chance . She and Lola had shared a room in London , and Annie had felt like she was babysitting a small child , one who wanted to chat all night , sleep all day , and could n't keep to a schedule if her life depended on it . <br> Forget London . This trip would be different . She had bought two new swimsuits and several trashy beach novels , had undergone a bikini wax , and had had herself sprayed with a fake tan . <br> Anne Louise was ready for anything . <br> Lola awoke from an Ambien- induced sleep . The room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it was too heavy for her neck . She would stop taking the sleeping pills no matter what Briggs said . She hated the way they made her feel , comatose and heavy , the way she could n't dream , as though sleep were a thing to be endured and not a release . She never took sleeping pills when she was with him . She never took any of her medication when she was with him . Briggs kept her as drugged up as a Saigon brothel girl but he never made her take anything . <br> She leaned over and pushed the button beside the bed and the automatic window blinds rose slowly . Bright sunshine flooded the room . She plumped the pillows behind her head and sat up slowly , letting her brain adjust to the new elevation , letting her eyes adjust to the light . Briggs 's side of the king- size bed was still rumpled where he had slept . He was an early riser . Early to bed and early to rise . No sleeping pills for Briggs . <br> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carrying a small coffee service on a silver tray . <br> " Good morning , Meesis Furman , " she said , smiling and setting the tray down on a table beside the bed . <br> " Good morning , Rosa . " The girl 's aura was lovely , all pink and golden and standing out around her head like a halo , like a painting of some fifteenth- century saint . She had a Madonna 's face and an aura to match . <br> " Did you sleep well ? " <br> The girl blushed but her eyes met Lola 's steadily . " Yes , " she said . " And I lock the door like you tell me to . " <br> " Good . " Lola smiled faintly and poured herself a cup of coffee . Briggs had a bad habit of abusing the help , especially those as young and pretty as Rosa , and Lola had given her a can of mace and had the deadbolt changed on her door the day she hired her . She had warned Briggs , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you implying , my dear ? " Lola had thought it was pretty clear what she was implying . <br> She lay back on her pillows with the coffee cup and saucer resting on her chest . Rosa went around the bed and began to smooth the sheets where Briggs had slept . " Meester Henry , he looked good , " she said . <br> " Yes , " Lola said , thinking of her only son with pleasure . He had come home from Cornell last week and brought with him the girl he planned to marry . Neither one had said a word but she had seen it in their faces , in the way their auras flared and flickered toward each other , drawn like smoke through a window . It had made her feel peaceful knowing that he loved someone else , that he no longer needed her . <br> She sipped her coffee and watched Rosa work . " You have a lovely aura , " she said . Rosa frowned slightly but kept working . She was used to Lola 's ways . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see auras , but now she could see them without the drugs . It was how she read people , how she knew whether their characters and intentions were good or bad . She wished she 'd been able to do this as a young woman . It would have saved her a lot of heartache . <br> " Carmen thought she would make a shrimp salad for lunch , " Rosa said . <br> " Okay ? " <br> " Yes . Shrimp salad will be fine . " Briggs 's aura was dark . His whole energy field was dotted with thick black masses like tumors . <br> " Your husband , did you ever love him ? " he 'd asked her a few weeks ago . She 'd looked up into his face and smiled . " It 's complicated , " she 'd said . <br> " It should n't be . " <br> Thinking of him , she was suddenly cheerful . Too cheerful to contain what she felt . Joy bubbled up from her toes to her fingertips , and she put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiggling her fingers . " Oh , Rosa , " she cried . " I 'm so happy ! " <br> Rosa , who was accustomed to Lola 's dramatic mood swings , came around the edge of the bed and hugged her . She patted Lola on the back . <br> " Good , " she said . <br> Lola hugged her fiercely . She was deliriously happy . In another week she would see her friends and everything would be wonderful , the four of them laughing and carrying on like crazy women , like they had in college , together again for one last time . <br> " Meester Furman , he say he 'll be back in a few days . He flew to the island to make sure the house and the boat are ready for your trip . " <br> Lola pulled away . She smoothed her hair off her brow and stared at Rosa . " What ? " she asked . <br> " He say for you not to worry . He say he 'll take care of everything . Just like always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joyous just a few short minutes ago , became suddenly ominous . Shadows moved across the ceiling like rain . Lola put her hand to her face and lay back against the pillows . Rosa rose and tucked the bedclothes around her . <br> " You want to get up now , Meesis Furman ? " Rosa 's aura flared around her head like a corona . Lola closed her eyes against its brightness . <br> " No . " The joy had gone , leaving in its place a dull feeling of dread . Lola tried to decide what to do but her head felt heavy . She could n't think clearly . They had agreed not to use the cell phones for a while . She could leave a message for him at the marina , warning him , but he might not get it for days . Lola turned her face to the window . " I 'm tired , " she said . She covered her eyes with her hand . " And Rosa ? " <br> " Yes ? " <br> " Push the button for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
