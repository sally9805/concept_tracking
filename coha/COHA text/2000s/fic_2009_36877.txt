It was a beautiful summer day , but the agitated woman pacing and kneading her hands barely noticed . Warm , golden sunshine flooded the sunroom where she was pacing , doing its best to warm the trembling woman . As hard as she tried , she could n't avoid the gallery of pictures that lined one wall . She knew she should n't have come here this morning , of all days . Yet she 'd carried her coffee cup in with the intention of sitting on one of the rattan chairs . Not to think . Never to think . She knew it was impossible , but she 'd come anyway . The sunroom had been Emily 's favorite room in the whole house . <p> Once this room had held a life-size giraffe , easels , paints , brushes , a blackboard and pastel chalks , a television , a pink polka-dotted sleeping bag with the name EMILY embroidered across the front in huge , white silky letters . An oversize toy box , also with the name EMILY stenciled on it , was stuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable for a sickly little girl had been covered in all the colors of the rainbow , just waiting for her to sit or lie down with her storybooks . <p> Once , a long time ago , a hundred years ago , a lifetime ago , this had been Emily 's favorite room . Before she had become bedridden . <p> Tears puddled up in Sarabess Windsor 's eyes . Why had she come in here ? She looked around for her coffee cup . She reached for it and sipped the cold brew . Okay , she 'd had some coffee . Now it was time to leave . But could she walk out of this room today ? Of course she could . She had to . <p> Sarabess looked at herself in the mirror that hung on the back of the door leading into a small lavatory . She 'd taken exceptional pains with her dress . She was wearing her grandmother 's pearls , her mother 's pearl earrings , and a mint-green linen dress that so far was unwrinkled . If she sat down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Rifkin Forrest arrived , and part of that put-together look did not include tears . Every silky gray hair was in place . Her makeup was flawless ; her unshed tears had n't destroyed her mascara . Just because she was sixty did n't mean she had to look sixty . The last time he 'd been to the house , Rif had told her she did n't look a day over fifty . Rif always said kind things . Rif said kind things because he 'd loved her forever . <p> Sarabess turned around at the door , seeing the sunroom as it was . Other than the gallery of pictures , all traces of Emily were gone . Now the room held rattan furniture covered with a bright-colored fabric . Dozens of green plants and young trees could be seen through the wall-to-wall windows . Overhead , two paddle fans whirred softly . A wet bar sat in one corner . She was the only one who ever came into this room . Once a year on this date she unlocked the door , walked into the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times she cried for the rest of the day . For weeks afterward she was n't herself . Still , she put herself through it because she did n't want to forget . As if a mother could ever forget the death of her child . <p> Sarabess closed and locked the door . Maybe she would never go into the room again . Maybe she should think about moving away . But she did not see how she could . Emily was buried here in the family mausoleum . She could never leave her firstborn . Why did she even think it was a possibility ? Then there was Mitzi Granger lurking on the fringe of her life . Even Rif could n't do anything about squirrelly Mitzi . Something had to be done about Mitzi . <p> The Windsors had lived on Windsor Hill in Crestwood , South Carolina , for hundreds of years . She was the last of the Windsors , though only by marriage . Then again , maybe she was n't the last of the Windsors . She would have to wait for time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windsor Hill walked down the hallway toward the heavy beveled-glass front door , she realized she 'd left her coffee cup in the sunroom . Well , it would have to stay there for another year . Or , until she felt brave enough to unlock the door and enter the room that was simply too full of memories . At the end of the hallway , she opened the door and walked out onto the verandah . She looked around as though seeing it for the very first time . She was surprised to see that the gardener had hung the giant ferns , cleaned the wicker furniture , laid down new fiber rugs , and arranged the clay pots of colorful petunias and geraniums . Even the six paddle fans had been cleaned and waxed . <p> How was it possible she had n't noticed ? Because she was so wrapped up in herself , that was why . She tried to remember the last time she 'd sat out here with a glass of lemonade . When she could n't come up with any answer , she started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire house . Where was Rifkin ? She looked down at her diamond-studded watch . He was ten minutes late . Rif was never late . Never . She wondered if his lateness was an omen of things to come . <p> For the first time since getting up , she was aware of the golden June day as she stared out at the Windsor grounds . Once the endless fields had produced cotton and tobacco . Now , they produced watermelons , pumpkins , and tomatoes that were shipped coast to coast . The acres of pecan trees went on as far as the eye could see . The pecans , too , were shipped all over the country . On the lowest plateau of the hill , cows grazed , hence the Windsor Dairy . Horses trotted in their paddock . There was a time when she 'd been an accomplished horsewoman . Once there had been a pony named Beauty and a little red cart that carried Emily around the yard . Just like Emily , they were gone , too . <p> Sarabess heard the powerful engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Twenty-three minutes late . What would be Rif 's excuse this fine Monday morning ? Did it even matter ? He was here now . <p> When the Mercedes stopped in front of the steps leading to the verandah , Sarabess waved a greeting before she rang the little bell on one of the tables next to a wicker chair-Martha 's signal that she should serve coffee on the verandah . Sarabess walked back to the top of the steps to wait for Rif 's light kiss on her cheek . She smiled when she realized there was to be no explanation as to why he was late . Rif hated to make explanations . It was the lawyer in him . She motioned to one of the chairs and sat down across from the attorney . <p> He was tall and tanned from the golf course . His hair was gun-metal gray . His eyes were sharp and summer blue and crinkled at the corners when he smiled . She loved it when he smiled at her . An intimate smile , she thought . Because he was semiretired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his days off . He was dressed in creased khakis and a bright yellow T-shirt . His only concession to his profession was the briefcase he was never without . He dropped it next to his chair before sitting down . His voice was deep and pleasant when he said , " You 're looking particularly fine this morning , Sarabess . " <p> " Why thank you , counselor . You look rather fit yourself this fine morning . Are you playing golf today ? " <p> " Unless you have something important you need taken care of . You sounded ... urgent when you called . " <p> " It 's time , Rif . " <p> The attorney did n't bother to pretend he did n't know what she was talking about . He knew his old friend was waiting for him to say something , but he opted for silence . Sarabess raised an eyebrow in question . Instead , he reached for the cup of coffee the old housekeeper poured for him . He sipped appreciatively . <p> Sarabess set her own cup on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . It 's time . And it 's also time to do something about Mitzi . I ... I want her taken care of once and for all . Do we understand each other , Rifkin ? " <p> Rifkin . Using his full name meant Sarabess was serious . <p> Rifkin watched as a tiny brown bird flew into one of the ferns . He knew the little bird was preparing her nest . " Let it be , Sarabess . You need to stop obsessing about ... about Mitzi . There 's nothing I can do legally , and we both know it . " <p> Sarabess leaned forward . " How can you say that to me ? " <p> " I can say it because I 'm your friend . Mitzi aside , you should have called me fifteen years ago to ask me to find her . I warned you this would happen . Now , it 's too late . " <p> Sarabess stood up . " It 's never too late . You hounded me daily for years to do what I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling me it 's too late ! I do n't believe that . If you wo n't do it , I 'll find someone who will . Mitzi may have me on a short leash financially , but I am not without influence in this town . As you well know , Rifkin . " <p> Suddenly he felt sick to his stomach . " You waited fifteen years too long . If you think for one minute that that girl is going to forgive you , you are wrong . " Rif brought the coffee cup to his lips . He did n't think he 'd ever tasted anything so bitter . <p> " She 's my daughter . I 'm her mother . " <p> Rif sighed and closed his eyes . His voice was so low Sarabess had to strain to hear it . " You gave birth to her . You were never her mother . You were Emily 's mother . As your attorney , I 'm advising you to let matters rest . As your friend and lover , I 'm asking you to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I have no intention of following your advice , Rifkin . It 's time . " <p> " For you , perhaps . Not for Trinity . If she wanted to see you , she knows where you are . She could have come home anytime . The fact that she has n't called or written in fifteen years means she does n't have any interest in seeing you . " <p> " She does n't even know Harold died . She should know that , " Sarabess said coldly . " Mitzi knows . If you could just get inside that ... that squirrelly head of hers , we could find Trinity in a heartbeat . " <p> " Now , almost fifteen years after the fact , you think Trinity should know her father died ! I ca n't believe I 'm hearing what I 'm hearing . I advise you to think seriously about what you are contemplating , Sarabess . You gave birth to Trinity so you could use her bone marrow so that Emily would live . Then you gave that child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hauled her up here one day a year on Princess Emily 's birthday . You had the Hendersons dress her up like a poor relation ; then you sent her away after the party . Not to mention the humiliation of those countless other command performances-whenever Emily pitched a fit . You 're delusional if you think Trinity will want to see you . " <p> " I had no other choice . Emily would have died . Because of ... of that ... procedure , I had thirteen more years with my darling daughter . Thirteen years ! I would n't trade those thirteen years for anything in the world . When ... When I explain things to Trinity , I 'm sure she will understand . She is my daughter , after all . She has only one mother . We all have only one mother . " Despite Sarabess 's efforts , her voice was colder than chipped ice , her eyes colder still . <p> Is he buying into my explanation ? At first blush , it does n't seem like it . Well , that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care how much it hurts , Sarabess , but you were never that girl 's mother . You did n't sit with her at night when she was sick . You did n't take her to church , you never took her shopping . You never once looked at her report card , never went to a school meeting . You never read her a bedtime story or tucked her into bed . Half the time you could n't remember what her name was . Emily did n't like her , either , thanks to you . Guilt is what took Harold to an early grave , and we both know it . I guess you 're just a lot tougher . <p> " Trinity has never touched the trust fund your husband , her father , set up for her . I believe that Harold told her about it when she was quite young . I can not even begin to imagine what that young girl thought at the time if , indeed , he did tell her . Maybe the knowledge of that monstrous trust fund was what made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory . If so , apparently Trinity did n't want any part of it , you , or Harold . Let it be . " <p> Sarabess fingered the pearls at her neck . She felt choked up at her lover 's words . " When did you get so ugly , Rifkin Forrest ? " <p> " Ten minutes ago , when I saw what you were about this morning . Today of all days . Why did n't you make the decision a week ago , a month ago , yesterday ? Today is the anniversary of Emily 's death . In seven months Trinity will be thirty and will come into the trust , " Rif said , his voice sounding ominous . <p> Sarabess did n't think Rif 's voice could get any colder , but it did . She actually shivered in the humid June air . <p> " You went in that room , you looked at the pictures , you relived the thirteen years that Trinity gave your daughter . You probably cried , and then you decided maybe this was a good time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mind that you might have grandchildren somewhere . That 's the part I want to believe . <p> " The other part , having to do with the trust fund that will revert to you if Trinity dies or is n't found in time to take possession of her trust , is not something I want to think about today . I 'm sorry , but I have to leave . I have a tee time in thirty minutes . " <p> Sarabess was speechless . " You 're leaving ? " <p> " Yes , I 'm leaving . I do n't want any part of upsetting that young woman 's life for your own selfish desires . " <p> Sarabess started to cry . " Please , Rif , do n't leave . I ... I 'm not doing this for me . You may be right-it may be too late-but I wo n't know if I do n't try . I just want to find her . I wo n't invade her life if it looks like I ... if ... she is n't interested . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rif 's son and law partner , " might do the search . He used to play with Trinity when they were little children . Emily used to watch them from the sunroom . She was so envious . " <p> A linen handkerchief found its way to her eyes . It all sounded good to her ears . It should-she 'd rehearsed this little speech for hours in front of the mirror . <p> Rifkin sighed wearily . " It always comes back to Emily , does n't it ? " <p> " Yes , it always comes back to Emily . You ca n't expect me to turn thirty years off and on like you 'd turn off a light switch . I made a mistake . I want to try and make it right . " That sounds good , too , Sarabess thought smugly . <p> " Jesus , Sarabess , you did n't just make a mistake , you made the Queen Mother of all mistakes . Now you want the child you threw away back . I 'm sorry , it just does n't work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too late . " <p> " Stop saying that . I did n't throw Trinity away . I ... What I did was pay the Hendersons to take care of her . I could n't do it . I was fighting for Emily 's life . Trinity had a roof over her head , good food , adequate medical care . If she was neglected , as you say , it was only by me and my husband . I will concede the point that the child needed a mother , and that 's where I failed her . If she ... If I had brought her here to the big house , she would have been raised by servants . At least with the Hendersons she had a normal life . She wanted for nothing , and do n't try to tell me otherwise . " <p> Sarabess had said these words so often , they sounded truthful to her ears . She struggled to cry . She whipped the handkerchief past her eyelashes as she watched Rifkin carefully . She needed him . <p> " Too bad you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going to factor in Trinity 's trust fund ? " <p> " The fund has nothing to do with this . The Hendersons did love Trinity in their own way . They are plain , hardworking people . They 're not demonstrative . That does n't mean they did n't love Trinity . They raised her for fifteen years . There was feeling there . Even as sick as he was , and living with that woman , Harold told me they were heartbroken when Trinity ran away . Harold would never have lied about something like that . " <p> Rifkin watched the little brown bird as she dived into the fern with a piece of string in her beak . Preparing her nest for her young . That 's how it 's supposed to be , he thought . Even the birds know about motherhood . " Were you brokenhearted , Sarabess ? Did Trinity 's running away affect you in any way ? " <p> He was just saying words , words he 'd said hundreds of times . It was a game , pure and simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pearls . " No . It barely registered . I was still mourning Emily . Nothing registered . Nothing . " Such a lie , she thought . <p> " I have to leave now , or I 'll miss my tee time . " <p> " Well , a tee time is certainly important . Even I understand that . Run along , Rifkin . Enjoy your golf game , " Sarabess said , in an icy voice . <p> Rifkin refused to be baited . He waved as he descended the steps . " Thanks for the coffee . " <p> Sarabess wanted to tell him to go to hell , but she bit down on her bottom lip instead . Her eyes filled again . Everything Rif had said was true . Tomorrow she would think about everything he 'd just said . Everything she 'd been thinking about for the past fifteen years . Tomorrow . Then again , maybe she would n't . <p> Today was Emily 's day . Today she had to go to the cemetery to talk to Emily . <p> Tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always did . <p> Chapter Two Crestwood , South Carolina , population 27,855 , was a pretty little town with sidewalks , tree-lined streets , cozy shops with colorful awnings , homey window displays , white benches underneath the ancient trees that shaded the streets like giant umbrellas , and old-fashioned lampposts . There was a town square with a bandstand where the town fathers stood at attention to view the seven yearly parades . <p> On the Fourth of July , the picnic kicked off at the bandstand , covered with flags and banners . The children of Crestwood decorated the entire square for Halloween in the hopes of winning the grand prize , which was a double-decker ice-cream cone from Elmo Mitchell 's drug store every Saturday afternoon for a full year . Santa Claus and his elves came to town in a horse-drawn sleigh on wheels the day after Thanksgiving . It was said in the Crestwood Record that every resident in town turned out for the event . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
