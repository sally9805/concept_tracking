<p> Rosie Clark remembers the winter afternoons when her son , Keydren , would come home from three hours of basketball practice , head to a nearby park and work on his game another three hours . <p> " He 's a ball-aholic , " she says . " He 's always been determined to prove he could play . " <p> Keydren Clark can play , and he can certainly score . So can Mike Helms and Michael Watson . <p> For proof , check the top of the list of NCAA Division I scoring leaders . Clark of St. Peter 's is third nationally at 26.2 points a game . Oakland 's Helms ( 26.4 ) is second and Watson ( 24.9 ) of Missouri-Kansas City ranks fifth . <p> The common thread ? None is taller than 6 feet . <p> Clark , a shade under 5-8 , is a freshman who has played 12 college games . The other two are juniors . The nation 's leading scorer , Eastern Illinois ' Henry Domercant ( 26.9 ) , is a 6-4 senior . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Mexico . <p> Since the NCAA began keeping track in 1948 , only two players shorter than 6-1 have won scoring titles : Iowa 's 5-9 Murray Wier in 1948 and Army 's 5-11 Kevin Houston in 1987 . <p> This season 's trio are the little guys who could . <p> More than average <p> Clark was anxious to prove his height would not be a serious obstacle in college , but even he is surprised at the prolific start to his career . <p> " I knew I could play , but I never thought this would happen , " the five-time Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference rookie of the week says . " I thought I 'd be just an average freshman , playing about 20 minutes a game . <p> " This has been a blessing . It shows what happens when you work hard and try to improve . It 's paying off for me . " <p> Clark credits his quickness with giving him an advantage . <p> " Most of the guys guarding me are bigger , but I have a quick first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a jumper , " he says . " Sometimes they play off me , but then I can get the shot off right in their face . " <p> St. Peter 's coach Bob Leckie acknowledges he did n't know what he had in Clark , who played at Rice High in New York , the team that ended sixth in the USA TODAY Super 25 last year . He averaged 13 points on a team with four seniors who now play for Division I teams . <p> By the third game Leckie knew what he had in his freshman guard . That 's when he watched Clark score 48 points in a double-overtime loss to Northern Arizona . <p> With the Peacocks trailing by 18 at halftime , Clark scored 27 in the second half and nine in the overtime . He showed uncanny range by making 10 of 16 three-point shots on the night . <p> " As we were walking off the floor , one of the Northern Arizona players was saying , ' That kid had 49 , ' " Leckie recalls . " He actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next game , against St. Francis ( N.Y. ) , he had 44 . <p> " To be honest , I did n't think he had that kind of production in him because he was n't a prolific scorer in high school and he had to make the switch from playing off the ball in high school to being a point guard . Never in my wildest dreams did I think he 'd do what he 's doing on the scoring side . " <p> Clark 's mother and father , Kentray Sims , played high school basketball in Livingston , Ala . His dad lives in Birmingham . His mom resides in Middletown , N.Y. , and has attended all but one of her son 's games . She made an 11-hour one-way drive to Cincinnati for the game against Xavier . <p> She thinks often of the days when she was the rebounder during those sessions at the park when her son was honing his skills . <p> " He learned to shoot because I 'd make him shoot from every angle on the court , " Clark 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he quickly started beating me . By the time he was in about the sixth grade , he was way out of my league . " <p> Clark , who leads the Peacocks in assists ( 40 in 12 games ) , has taken more than twice as many shots ( 243 ) as any teammate . He is shooting 39.5% from the field , 40.5% from three-point range and 87.5% from the foul line . <p> After torching Northern Arizona from the three  --  point arc , he hit only one three-pointer against St. Francis but made 17 of 19 foul shots . <p> Despite Clark averaging about 20 field goal attempts a game , Leckie says his young star , who turned 18 in October , is playing within the offense . " He 's not a chucker . He lets the game come to him , " the coach says . " He 's very humble , and he 's fit in really well . " <p> " I 'm amazed it 's happening , " Clark says . " Sometimes I do n't even know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While Missouri-Kansas City 's 6-foot Watson is the fifth-leading scorer in the nation , he 's second in his league . That 's because Oakland 's 6-foot Helms leads the Mid-Continent Conference . <p> Their teams meet Thursday in Kansas City . Watson led the league in scoring last season and Helms was second . <p> Helms ' high game this season was 43 points against Texas Southern . The shooting guard 's consistency has been a key . He surpassed 30 in four other games and shoots 47.5% from the floor . <p> " I 've been able to score my whole life ; it 's almost second nature to me , " says Helms , who played at Martin Luther King High in Detroit and averaged 21 points as a senior . <p> Although Helms has been getting 18.6 shots a game , two teammates , Rawle Marshall ( 15.1 shots ) and Courtney Scott ( 11.8 ) , also have been getting plenty of looks . <p> " It 's not like I 'm getting all the shots . That 's not the kind of offense we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helms often played in a four- or even a five-guard lineup . But because of his leaping ability , he sometimes played in the post , where he could turn and shoot over opponents . <p> " He 's almost like a freak of nature because he 's a 6-foot guy who 's very strong and muscular and he can jump out of the gym , " Oakland coach Greg Kampe says . " I 've seen him block a shot above the square ( on the backboard ) . <p> " He can score so many ways . He 's the kind of guy who can still get you 16 points even if he 's not shooting well . He gets put-backs , he can score in the post and he can get you a steal and dunk . And he gets to the line . " <p> Watson is a cousin of Memphis Grizzlies point guard Earl Watson and is playing the point for the Kangaroos this year after playing shooting guard last season . <p> Like St. Peter 's Clark , Watson is getting a lot of shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-point range . But he also has almost three times as many assists as any teammate . The team , however , is struggling with a 2-12 record against a schedule that has included Colorado , Oklahoma State and Kansas . <p> " I have to do more things as the point guard , " Watson says . " I have to run the offense , get more guys involved . I was n't really expecting to carry so much of the load offensively , and my goal is still to get the rest of the guys more involved , but they 've been doing a good job finding me . <p> " I can pretty much score from anywhere , and I 'm taking what the defense is giving me . " <p> Missouri-Kansas City coach Rich Zvosec says Watson has learned to play under control as his career has advanced . <p> " He used to be a kid who was too quick for his body , " Zvosec says . " He 's learned to slow himself down so he can take more shots on balance . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet road , but now he sees the play coming and can make the play . "
