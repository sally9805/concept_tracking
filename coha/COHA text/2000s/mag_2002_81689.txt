Throughout most of the NBA season the feeling was that come the Finals , the Western Conference champ would squash its Eastern counterpart flatter than a bug on a doormat . It 's stating the obvious , of course , to suggest that such a squishy scenario could still unfold . The Los Angeles Lakers are prohibitive favorites to three-peat , possessing home court advantage , championship nerves and renewed confidence after a bump-and-grind seven-game Western finals against the Sacramento Kings . But as Continental Airlines Arena , which is not usually a hoops hotbed this time of year , prepares to get all spiffy for its first Finals  --  it is set to host Game 3 on Sunday night  --  there appears to be more than a sliver of hope for the East . What a grand thought : Jason and his Argo-Nets in full sail on the Jersey swampland ! // The postseason is about marquee players making marquee plays , and right now no star 's name is writ larger , or illuminated brighter , than Jason Kidd 's . The first player since Magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference final , Kidd was stupendous as the New Jersey Nets beat the Boston Celtics in six games to claim the conference title last week . Did the Eastern champ 's prospects first rise in Game 4 , when the 6 ' 5 " , 220-pound Kidd sacrificed his body to draw three offensive fouls in the fourth quarter ? Or was it after that game , when the normally placid Kidd made a triumphant gesture to the crude FleetCenter fans who had harassed his wife and son ? Or was it perhaps during the decisive stretch run in Game 6 , when Kidd , storming the lane , flipped a blind , backward shovel pass to a cutting Aaron Williams ? Consider : It was largely due to the brilliance of point guard Mike Bibby that Sacramento nearly beat L.A. Does n't that suggest that Kidd , who is bigger , stronger and savvier than Bibby , might prevail ? // Here 's a more important question : Will Kobe Bryant allow him to ? // Strictly speaking , Kidd and Bryant , the Lakers ' shooting guard , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most assuredly be scrutinizing each other 's facial pores by the time the Finals are over . When Los Angeles needs someone to handle the ball under pressure , Bryant brings it up . When the Lakers need someone to stymie an offensive-minded point guard , Bryant provides the D ; he often checked Bibby in crunch time . " We need to throw a lot of people at Jason , " said L.A. forward Rick Fox on Sunday after his team 's 112-106 Game 7 overtime win over the Kings , " and Kobe will certainly be one of them . " // And Kidd will be called upon to body up on Bryant . He ca n't do it for long stretches  --  that would be like asking the chef to roast the pheasant , then flamb ? the bananas Foster at the table . No player , even one as indefatigable as Kidd , can guard Bryant and still effectively direct an offense . But New Jersey coach Byron Scott knows that Kidd is his best hope against Bryant and that the competitiveness of the series , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how the backcourt stars fare against each other . ( And you thought the matchup between Todd MacCulloch and Shaquille O'Neal was the pivotal one. ) // Both Kidd and Bryant are supreme playground players who thrive in classic  --  dare we say old-fashioned ?  --  half-court systems . Much of what the Nets run was installed , with Scott 's blessing , by assistant Eddie Jordan , who was influenced by former Princeton coach Pete Carril when they shared time on Sacramento 's bench from 1996 to ' 98 . The offense emphasizes fundamental basketball : passing , backdoor cuts , screening away from the ball , scissors movement off the high post , a dribble exchange or back pass that triggers the attack . " Aesthetically pleasing , " is how New Jersey 's offense was summed up by Lakers coach Phil Jackson , who , despite having started kindly , is a good bet to offend the entire Garden State with a remark or two during the series . // In Carril 's scheme five players touch and shoot the ball , and isolation is a tactic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nets ' top three scorers during the season averaged 14.9 , 14.8 and 14.7 points , in the persons of Kenyon Martin , Keith Van Horn and Kidd , respectively . ( As a reflection of Kidd 's prime-time nature , his average in the playoffs had zoomed to 19.3 points through Sunday . ) Martin is , in fact , the least prolific leading scorer for a Finals team since Kleggie Hermsen averaged 12.0 points per game for the 1947-48 champion Baltimore Bullets . This is just a wild guess , but it 's unlikely that Martin knew he was challenging a mark held by somebody named Kleggie. // In the second half of the season New Jersey ran more pick-and-rolls ( definitely not part of the Princeton offense ) , with Kidd controlling the ball . That is a perfect tactic for a canny decision-maker like Kidd , especially after the defense has been forced to worry about backdoor cuts . The only problem is that the pick-and-roll often yields an outside shot rather than a drive to the basket , and the Nets , Kidd included , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sacramento series by the reluctance of his frontcourtmen , Shaq included , to come out and challenge Bibby when he came off screens . New Jersey will try to pull O'Neal out by doing the same thing . But if the Nets are firing blanks , thereby allowing Shaq to camp near the basket and wait for rebounds , they do n't have a chance . // Like Kidd , who prefers wide-open spaces , Bryant sometimes gets frustrated by the constraints of the Lakers ' triangle or triple-post offense , which was refined four decades ago by L.A. assistant Tex Winter , a demanding Yoda . Winter , often discontent , charts each shot and notes , with a little F , every time a player forces a shot in the triangle , or , as Winter puts it , " shoots under duress . " Bryant still earns too many F 's  --  four in the first quarter alone on Sunday . Winter ca n't recall an F-free game , but when he coached under Jackson in Chicago , Michael Jordan came close several times . After the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Michael was considerably smarter than Kobe in what we want to be done . But you have to remember that Kobe is only 23 and that Michael was several years older when he really became proficient with the triangle . " // Geometrical nuances aside , Bryant is a phenomenal half-court player , with the footwork and gamesmanship of a player who 's been in the league 16 years , not six . He posts up with utter confidence , pretzeling his body to create space . He has an uncanny ability to keep his pivot foot planted while stepping through with his other leg to elude a defender . ( He 's that rare superstar who does n't need a break from the refs on traveling calls . ) He 's terrific at the fadeaway jump shot , a skill that Jordan did n't master until much later in his career . // Bryant , as was the case with Jordan , does not play on a fast-breaking team even though he seems like a fast-breaking kind of guy . Rarely is Kobe at full speed . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's in glide mode , bouncing the ball with his head up , looking for space , calculating , reading the court , then  --  whoosh !  --  crossing over and disappearing , leaving behind a flat-footed defender . // Kidd , by contrast , runs the floor relentlessly , as do Martin and Kerry Kittles , Kidd 's storkish backcourt partner . The Nets run so much that they should hand Kidd spikes and a baton ; the Carril-Jordan contributions to New Jersey 's offense notwithstanding , what has gotten this onetime stooge of a team this far has been its transition game . The best thing about Kidd in the open floor is that he never auditions for the Magic Johnson Highlight Reel  --  he makes economical passes that lead to baskets . Too many point guards fall in love with the dribble on the break , but when Kittles or Martin is streaking ahead , Kidd never hesitates to deliver the ball early . If the Nets can set the Lakers back on their heels and reel off a couple of 10-0 runs , their chances increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and MacCulloch to out-battle O'Neal , Fox and Robert Horry for boards . Many of those long defensive caroms that Kidd usually snatches to start the break may end up instead in the paws of Bryant , perhaps the only guard in the league who rebounds as well as Kidd. // For all Kidd 's fill-up-the-box-score majesty , his greatest contribution to the Eastern champions ca n't be measured with statistics . It 's almost as if the Nets did n't exist ( or at least had n't existed since the Julius Erving ABA days of the 1970s ) before the deal last July that brought Kidd to the swamp and sent Stephon Marbury to the Phoenix Suns . Kidd is his team 's Mr. Everything , its sun and its moon , the essence of its newfound spirit . He provides a safety net for Kittles , who was a question mark after off-season knee surgery ; a role model for backup guard Lucious Harris , who had been perceived as a player who did n't give it 100% every night ; a balm for Van Horn , whose confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consecutive seasons . // Bryant , by contrast , is not the spiritual cynosure of the Lakers , who do n't seem to require one . Kobe , like Shaq , is with his teammates but not of them . When the two stars need to feed off each other on the court , they simply turn the triangle into a line . Same thing off the court : Between Games 5 and 6 of the Kings series , for example , an edgy Bryant made a 2:30 a.m. call to Shaq , and they talked about the importance of the next two games , both of which resulted in Los Angeles victories . // With understandable brio , Van Horn said last week that the Kidd-for-Marbury deal " might go down in history as the biggest trade ever in terms of a turnaround for a team . " Well , Keith , the draft-day deal with the St. Louis Hawks that brought Bill Russell to the Boston Celtics in 1956 was a little bigger , and here 's one from ' 96 that was n't bad : The Lakers gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bryant . There 's no doubt that Kidd has changed the image of the Nets , put a big smiley face on a downtrodden franchise in a quest for its first NBA championship . But Kidd 's play aside , New Jersey will ultimately be kid 's play for Kobe and Shaq , who , in six games , will lead the Lakers to their third straight title .
