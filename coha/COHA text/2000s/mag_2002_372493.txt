There are still some old-school holdouts  --  Woody Allen , for one  --  but much of the rest of digital-age hollywood is eagerly embracing alternate endings in feature films released on DVD . Basically , it 's a way to get you to rewatch a film you 've already seen . But which new climaxes are worth your while ? We rate the new endings of five DVDs . <P>  --  By Roy B. White <P> TRAINING DAY <P> ALTERNATE ENDING The original version ends in a hail of gunfire . In the new ending , young cop Jake Hoyt ( Ethan Hawke ) confronts a couple of baddies associated with his evil partner , Alonzo Harris ( Denzel Washington ) , and gets to speak his piece . <P> RATING : 2 DISCS The new finish does n't add much to the plot or character development . <P> SWORDFISH <P> ALTERNATE ENDING In the original finish , villains  --  we wo n't say which ones  --  go on to commit more crimes . The two alternate versions offer twists  --  the bad guys are foiled entirely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more peaceably . <P> RATING : 4 DISCS Both new endings allow Halle Berry and John Travolta to shine . <P> K-PAX <P> ALTERNATE ENDING In the original , the alien ( he may be just a mental patient ) played by Kevin Spacey meets his fate , prompting his doctor friend ( Jeff Bridges ) to reunite with his son . The alternate is more cryptic , leaving Bridges staring in wonder at the night sky . <P> RATING : 2 DISCS This finale is a surprise , but it would be a stretch to call it interesting . <P> BANDITS <P> ALTERNATE ENDING In the original movie , bank robbers Joe ( Bruce Willis ) and Terry ( Billy Bob Thornton ) and their co-conspirators try to pull off a daring heist . The alternate ending gives a glimpse of each of their lives after the spectacular caper . <P> RATING : 3 DISCS The new conclusion is cute , quaint and refreshingly open-ended . <P> JOY RIDE <P> ALTERNATE ENDING In the original , three young adults on a road trip anger a trucker , who then seeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; one ending showcases the heroine taking a more active role . <P> RATING : 5 DISCS Good , suspenseful endings that bring something extra .
