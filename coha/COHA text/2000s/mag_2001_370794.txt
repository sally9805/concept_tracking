One hot spring day , I was walking with EUDORA WELTY through a little shopping mall . It was her birthday , April 13 . There was a surprise party waiting at a bookstore down the way . She was 86 . As we walked rather slowly along the glass storefronts , we came to where a wide , smiling , pink-faced man was inflating colorful balloons . As each balloon filled and fattened , the cylinder emitted quite a loud whoosh of air . Eudora looked about to find the sound . " Balloons , " I said . I had her hand . " Someone 's apparently having a do . " " Oh , " she said . Those luminous , pale blue eyes igniting , her magical face suppressing once again an amused smile . " I just thought it was someone who saw me , sighing . " <P> A minor moment , yes  --  and not , goodness knows , Eudora Welty in a nutshell . The truly grand among us do n't fit into nutshells . Yet it exemplifies the continual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . To take a walk or a Saturday drive with Eudora was to have the world narrated to you , recalibrated and transformed into language that was surprising , sometimes shocking , always sympathetic , frequently hilarious and full of perception , wonder and delight . This commerce produced 20 or so extraordinary books , a world of adoring readers , a house full of prizes and a life lived solely , though not alone , and utterly to her own measure . To know Eudora Welty was to experience the best of life on an exquisitely human scale and to be reminded again where the seeds of greatness are sown . <P>  --  By Richard Ford
