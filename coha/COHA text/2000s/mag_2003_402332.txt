// In this age of readily available global information it is still confusing , for both patient and doctor , when they read articles about vitamin , mineral and electrolyte replacements . Many argue that if you eat right , yon should n't need supplements . This attitude exists because of the confusion between diet and nutrition- Equally important is not only what we eat but also how our body utilizes and excretes it . Only recently have minerals received the importance they deserve . The following are example of body system disorders ( short circuits ) that are either caused by , or affected by , mineral deficiencies and imbalances : cardio-vascular , gastrointestinal , muscular , skeletal , neurological , immune and endocrine . Out of Sync : The Consequences Minerals do not work alone ; they work in synchronicity ( in balance ) with one another , as well as with the metabolism of proteins , carbohydrates , fats and vitamins . When one mineral is excessive , it steals from others , therefore causing a chain reaction of deficiencies . FYI : It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various sectors . An abnormal concentration or imbalance among these minerals can affect psychological functions , including emotions , memory , perception , learning and behavior . I personally experienced the effects of minerals that were " out of sync . " After my life-threatening accident , the prescription drugs that saved my life almost took it , and left me with multiple chemical sensitivities , leaky gut syndrome , fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue . As in most of these " invisible " disorders , a condition of malabsorption existed . Malabsorption meant my body was taking in the needed supplement but was unable to make use of it-supplementation was either excreted and provided no benefit or it was stored and could manifest as another set of symptoms and disorders . Whenever I consumed a mineral or calcium replacement my right eye would " flutter " or " twitch " to the point where it caused me great concern-not to mention the annoyance . I had developed malabsorption from a damaged intestinal tract caused by leaky gut syndrome , clinically known as intestinal permeability . My body was not able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributing to excruciating leg cramps and widespread muscle pain . The Body 's Fiber Optic Communication System The body requires electrical transmitters , " spark plugs , " in order to send " messages " as electrical signals within the body . These brain signals are transmitted mainly through body fluids . Many cases of brain fog ( inability to concentrate or connect thoughts ) , ADD/ADHD , muscle cramps/spasms and tingling/numbness can be the symptom of a " low battery " lacking the electrical impulse stimulus necessary to perform nerve and muscle functions . Minerals are stored primarily in the body 's bone and muscle tissue . The absorbed mineral must then be carried through the blood to the cells and then absorbed , in order for the cell membrane to be utilized . A proper balance of minerals and electrolytes make up the electrically charged ions that help regulate the body 's water and acid-alkaline balance , osmotic pressure , nerve impulse conduction and muscle contraction . Digestion and absorption is especially a challenge for those with symptoms of any disorder that compromises the digestive system including , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritable bowel , leaky gut , environmental illness , gulf war syndrome and conditions which cause chronic diarrhea . Four Essential Minerals : Their Job Description Calcium : The Most Abundant Mineral in the Body The average adult contains 2.5 pounds of calcium . Calcium is not only vital for healthy bones and teeth , it is also thought to be responsible for the high incidence of hypertension ( high blood pressure ) in the U.S. Functions : Evidence shows calcium can help prevent colon cancer , regulate heart function , activate enzymes involved in protein digestion and energy production . Calcium transmits nerve impulses and is involved in blood clotting , regulates the relaxation and contraction of muscles , especially the heart , and assists in vitamin absorption . FYI : It 's important to note that if your diet . consists of soft drinks , food additives and meats , your phosphorus intake may be too high to maintain a good calcium balance . Phosphorus : second Most Abundant Mineral in the Body The average sized adult carries around 1.25 to 1.5 pounds of phosphorus , or approximately one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most is found in bones and teeth . Phosphorus is also found in body cells and blood , and plays a role in every chemical reaction in the body-mostly in the utilization of fats , proteins and carbohydrates . Functions : Phosphorus combines with fats in the blood to make phospholipids , which become part of the cell that regulates the tissue minerals in and out of the cell walls and transports fats in the circulatory system . Phosphorus plays an important role in energy metabolism , storage and regulation , muscle contraction , transfer of nerve impulses , hormone and protein synthesis , enhancing effectiveness of B vitamins and maintaining proper acid-base balance ( pH ) . Symptoms of Phosphorus to Calcium Imbalance : Calcium and phosphorus levels influence each other . Researchers have suggested that intake should be equal in ratio of one to one-even though bone ratio is two to one . When phosphorus consumption exceeds calcium , along with long-term low calcium and high protein intake , it is believed to be a major factor in osteoporosis . Carbonated beverages , high in phosphorus , potentially expose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depletion . Potassium and Sodium : Essential for Smooth Functioning Mind and Body The functions of potassium are many , one of the most important is to neutralize acid wastes . Sodium controls the acid-alkaline balance in the muscles to avoid spasms and cramps . Because of modern-day food refining and processing , the potassium that was once present in natural foods is removed as whole grains are refined into white flour and fruit is turned into juice or sauce . In order to extend shelf life , foods are loaded with sodium compounds . This causes a reverse ratio , a serious compromise to our health , as the body must consume 10 times more potassium as sodium . Very few mineral replacements contain anywhere near the correct ratio . Symptoms of Potassium to Sodium Imbalance : Heart irregularity , chronic fatigue , muscle pain , immune deficiencies , bloating , calcium excretion , cancer and hypertension . During my own illness , I experimented with dozens of mineral supplements , all without any significant relief . As a doctor who consults with thousands of clients worldwide , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wide range of symptoms from mineral imbalances including brain fog , muscle cramps , multiple chemical sensitivities and involuntary movements . Finally , I was reintroduced to a mineral/ electrolyte replacement made from organic goat milk whey and much to my delight , I was symptom-free - as were my clients with many of the same complaints . This tasty brown powder is essentially predigested ; my body did n't have to do the work to break down pills and capsules - it was readily absorbed and utilized . The nutritional analysis of mineral whey confirms it to be high in natural amino acids and minerals . It also contains some vitamins , probiotics and digestive enzymes - a perfect blend to restore and maintain health naturally . The soluble protein lactoglobulins in whey are identical to serum globulin in human blood and contain antibodies that strengthen the immune system . The amino acids in whey are rated higher in bioavailability than those in eggs , soy , rice , wheat and beef , according to the World Health Organization .

Minerals are more important than vitamins since plants manufacture vitamins , but minerals must be obtained from the soil , " or from a source such as mineral whey which allows the body to utilize the minerals through greater absorption . Minerals : Their Role in Detoxification When an individual undergoes any type of detoxification program , it is essential to replenish mineral reserves . Cleansing/detoxification therapies are life saving and health building , however , in the process they not only eliminate toxins but also minerals and electrolytes . Minerals and Fiber Supplements Everywhere we look , from magazines and newspapers to radio and television , fiber and fiber products are widely talked about and highly advertised . We are literally being bombarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not only the " right " thing to do but will solve practically all of life 's problems . Yes , fiber is essential and without it any detoxification therapy would not be successful . However , it is important to understand that fiber supplements should not be taken at the same time as mineral/ electrolyte replacements - fiber can draw out the minerals you have just replaced . Therefore , if you take a fiber supplement in the evening , take your mineral replacement early in the day or during the day as a natural " pick-me-up .
