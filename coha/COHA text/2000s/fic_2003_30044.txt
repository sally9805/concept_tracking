PROLOGUE The day was grey and bitter cold , and the dogs would not take the scent . The big black bitch had taken one sniff at the bear tracks , backed off , and skulked back to the pack with her tail between her legs . The dogs huddled together miserably on the riverbank as the wind snapped at them . Chett felt it too , biting through his layers of black wool and boiled leather . It was too bloody cold for man or beast , but here they were . His mouth twisted , and he could almost feel the boils that covered his cheeks and neck growing red and angry . I should be safe back at the Wall , tending the bloody ravens and making fires for old Maester Aemon . It was the bastard Jon Snow who had taken that from him , him and his fat friend Sam Tarly . It was their fault he was here , freezing his bloody balls off with a pack of hounds deep in the haunted forest . " Seven hells . " He gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention . " Track , you bastards . That 's a bear print . You want some meat or no ? Find ! " But the hounds only huddled closer , whining . Chett snapped his short lash above their heads , and the black bitch snarled at him . " Dog meat would taste as good as bear , " he wamed her , his breath frosting with every word . Lark the Sisterman stood with his arms crossed over his chest ana m hands tucked up into his armpits . He wore black wool gloves , but he was always complaining how his fingers were frozen . " It 's too bloody cold to hunt , ' ' he said . " Bugger this bear , he 's not worth freezing over . " We ca n't go back emptyhand , Lark , " rumbled Small Paul through the brown whiskers that covered most of his face . " The Lord Commander would n't like that . " There wasice under the big man 's squashed pug nose , where his snot had frozen . A huge hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spear . " Bugger that Old Bear too , " said the Sistemman , a thin man with sharp features and nervous eyes . " Mormont will be dead before daybreak , remember ? Who cares what he likes ? " Small Paul blinked his black little eyes . Maybe he had forgotten , Chett thought ; he was stupid enough to forget most anything . " Why do we have to kill the Old Bear ? Why do n't we just go off and let him be ? " " You think he 'll let us be ? " said Lark . " He 'll hunt us down . You want to be hunted , you great muttonhead ? " " No , " said Small Paul . " I do n't want that . I do n't . " " So you 'll kill him ? " said Lark . " Yes . " The huge man stamped the butt of his spear on the frozen riverbank . " I will . He should n't hunt us . " The Sisterman took his hands from his ammpits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officers , I say . " Chett was sick of hearing it . " We been over this . The Old Bear dies , and Blane from the Shadow Tower . Grubbs and Aethan as well , their ill luck for drawing the watch , Dywen and Bannen for their tracking , and Ser Piggy for the ravens . That 's all . We kill them quiet , while they sleep . One scream and we 're wormfood , every one of us . " His boils were red with rage . " Just do your bit and see that your cousins do theirs . And Paul , try and remember , it 's third watch , not second . " " Third watch , " the big man said , through hair and frozen snot . " Me and Softfoot . I remember , Chett . " The moon would be black tonight , and they had jiggered the watches so as to have eight of their own standing sentry , with two more guarding the horses . It was n't going to get much riper than that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Chett meant to be well away from here before that happened . He meant to live . Three hundred sworn brothers of the Night 's Watch had ridden north , two hundred from Castle Black and another hundred from the Shadow Tower . It was the biggest ranging in living memory , near a third of the Watch 's strength . They meant to find Ben Stark , Ser Waymar Royce , and the other ranchers who 'd gone missing , and discover why the wildlings were leaving their villages . Well , they were no closer to Stark and Royce than when they 'd left the Wall , but they 'd leamed where all the wildlings had gone - up into the icy heights of the godsforsaken Frostfangs . They could squat up there till the end of time and it would n't prick Chett 's boils none . But no . They were coming down . Down the Milkwater . Chett raised his eyes and there it was . The river 's stony banks were bearded by ice , lt 's pale milky waters flowing endlessly down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildlings were flowing down the same way . Thoren Smallwood had retumed in a lather three days past . While he was telling the Old Bear what his scouts had seen , his man Kedge Whiteye told the rest of them . " They 're still well up the foothills , but they 're coming , " Kedge said , warming his hands over the fire . " Harma the Dogshead has the van , the poxy bitch . Goady crept up on her camp and saw her plain by the fire . That fool Tumberjon wanted to pick her off with an arrow , but Smallwood had better sense . " Chett spat . " How many were there , could you tell ? " " Many and more . Twenty , thirty thousand , we did n't stay to count . Hamma had five hundred in the van , every one ahorse . ' The men around the fire exchanged uneasy looks . It was a rare thing to find even a dozen mounted wildlings , and five hundred . . . " Smallwood sent Bannen and me wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , " Kedge went on . " There was no end of them . They 're moving slow as a frozen river , four , five miles a day , but they do n't look like they mean to go back to their villages neither . More'n half were women and children , and they were driving their animals before them , goats , sheep , even aurochs dragging sledges . They 'd loaded up with bales of fur and sides of meat , cages of chickens , butter chums and spinning wheels , every damn thing they own . The mules and garrons was so heavy laden you 'd think their backs would break . The women as well . " " And they follow the Milkwater ? " Lark the Sisterman asked . " I said so , did n't I ? " The Milkwater would take them past the Fist of the First Men , the ancient ringfort where the Night 's Watch had made its camp . Any man with a thimble of sense could see that it was time to pull up stakes and fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fist with spikes and pits and caltrops , but against such a host all that was pointless . If they stayed here , they would be engulfed and overwhelmed . And Thoren Smallwood wanted to attack . Sweet Donnel Hill was squire to Ser Mallador Locke , and the night before last Smallwood had come to Locke 's tent . Ser Mallador had been of the same mind as old Ser Ottyn Wythers , urging a retreat on the Wall , but Smallwood wanted to convince him otherwise . " This King-beyond-the-Wall will never look for us so far north , " Sweet Donnel reported him saying . " And this great host of his is a shambling horde , full of useless mouths who wo n't know what end of a sword to hold . One blow will take all the fight out of them and send them howling back to their hovels for another fifty years . " Three hundred against thirty thousand . Chett called that rank madness , and what was madder still was that Ser Mallador had been persuaded ' and the two of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If we wait too long , this chance may be lost , never to come again , " Smallwood was saying to anyone who would listen . Against that , Ser Ottyn Wythers said , " We are the shield that guards the realms of men . You do not throw away your shield for no good purpose , " but to that Thoren Smallwood said , " In a swordfight , a man 's surest defense is the swift stroke that slays his foe , not cringing behind a shield . " Neither Smallwood nor Wythers had the command , though . Lord Mormont did , and Mommont was waiting for his other scouts , for Jarman Buckwell and the men who 'd climbed the Giant 's Stair , and for Qhorin Halfhand and Jon Snow , who 'd gone to probe the Skirling Pass . Buckwell and the Halfhand were late in retuming , though . Dead , most like . Chett pictured Jon Snow lying blue and frozen on some bleak mountaintop with a wildling spear up his bastard 's arse . The thought made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . " There 's no bear here , " he decided abruptly . " Just an old print , that 's all . Back to the Fist . " The dogs almost yanked him off his feet , as eager to get back as he was . Maybe they thought they were going to get fed . Chett had to laugh . He had n't fed them for three days now , to turn them mean and hungry . Tonight , before slipping off into the dark , he 'd tum them loose among the horse lines , after Sweet Donnel Hill and Clubfoot Karl cut the tethers . They 'll have snarling hounds and panicked horses all over the Fist , running through fires , jumping the ringwall , and trampling down tents . With all the confusion , it might be hours before anyone noticed that fourteen brothers were missing . Lark had wanted to bring in twice that number , but what could you expect from some stupid fishbreath Sisterman ? Whisper a word in the wrong ear and before you knew it you 'd be short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enough to do what needed doing but not so many that they could n't keep the secret . Chett had recruited most of them himself . Small Paul was one of his ; the strongest man on the Wall , even if he was slower than a dead snail . He 'd once broken a wildling 's back with a hug . They had Dirk as well , named for his favorite weapon , and the little grey man the brothers called Softfoot , who 'd taped a hundred women in his youth , and liked to boast how none had never seen nor heard him until he shoved it up inside them . The plan was Chett 's . He was the clever one ; he 'd been steward to old Maester Aemon for four good years before that bastard Jon Snow had done him out so his job could be handed to his fat pig of a friend . When he killed Sam Tarly tonight , he planned to whisper , " Give my love to Lord Snow , " right in his ear before he sliced Ser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out through all those layers of suet . Chett knew the ravens , so he would n't have no trouble there , no more than he would with Tarly . One touch of the knife and that craven would piss his pants and start blubbering for his life . Let him beg , it wo n't do him no good . After he opened his throat , he 'd open the cages and shoo the birds away , so no messages reached the Wall . Softfoot and Small Pau1 would kill the Old Bear , Dirk would do Blane , and Lark and his cousins would silence Bannen and old Dywen , to keep them from sniffing after their trail . They 'd been caching food for a fortnight , and Sweet Donne1 and Clubfoot Karl would have the horses ready . With Mormont dead , command would pass to Ser Ottyn Wythers , an old done man , and failing . He 'll be running for the Wall before sundown , and he wo n't waste no men sending them after us neither . The dogs pulled at him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the Fist punching its way up through the green . The day was so dark that the Old Bear had the torches lit , a great circle of them buming all along the ringwall that crowned the top of the steep stony hill . The three of them waded across a brook . The water was icy cold , and patches of ice were spreading across its surface . " I 'm going to make for the coast , " Lark the Sisterman confided . " Me and my cousins . We 'll build us a boat , sail back home to the Sisters . " And at home they 'll know you for deserters and lop off your fool heads , thought Chett . There was no leaving the Night 's Watch , once you said your words . Anywhere in the Seven Kingdoms , they 'd take you and kill you . Ollo Lophand now , he was talking about sailing back to Tyrosh , where he claimed men did n't lose their hands for a bit of honest thievery , nor get sent off to freeze their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wife . Chett had weighed going with him , but he did n't speak their wet girly tongue . And what could he do in Tyrosh ? He had no trade to speak of , growing up in Hag 's Mire . His father had spent his life grubbing in other men 's fields and collecting leeches . He 'd strip down bare but for a thick leather clout , and go wading in the murky waters . When he climbed out he 'd be covered from nipple to ankle . Sometimes he made Chett help pull the leeches off . One had attached itself to his palm once , and he 'd smashed it against a wall in revulsion . His father beat him bloody for that . The maesters bought the leeches at twelve-for-apenny . Lark could go home if he liked , and the damn Tyroshi too , but not Chett . If he never saw Hag 's Mire again , it would be too bloody soon . He had liked the look of Craster 's Keep , himself . Craster lived high as a lord there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That would be a laugh . Chett the 1eechman 's son , a lord with a keep . His banner could be a dozen leeches on a field of pink . But why stop at lord ? Maybe he should be a king .
