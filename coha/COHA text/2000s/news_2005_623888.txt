<p> Shortly after 10 a.m. , Saad Fathul Mohammed strode into the polling station on 40th Street holding his 10-year-old son , Ali , firmly by the hand , and picked up a ballot that read : " I agree with the draft constitution . " <p> As Ali wrapped his slender arm around a cardboard polling booth , Mohammed checked the box marked " No . " <p> Then he folded the ballot in half , dipped his right finger in indelible purple ink to show that he had already voted , and dropped the folded paper in a sealed plastic ballot box . <p> " This is democracy in Iraq , " Mohammed said , and Ali smiled , shyly . <p> Like Mohammed , thousands of Sunni Arab voters in this north-central Iraqi city cast their ballots Saturday in the referendum that will decide the fate of this embattled country . Passage of the constitution would set a calendar for forming the first post-Saddam Hussein government , while failure would require the nation 's politicians to go back to the drawing board to craft another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , U.S. Army Lt. Col. Todd Wood waited impatiently in his armored humvee for news about the vote . <p> Barred from getting any closer by military orders for election day , the 42-year-old colonel climbed out of his truck and watched boys play soccer in the dusty , empty street . He climbed back in and listened to radio transmissions from his battalion headquarters , which was tracking voters in the 33 polling stations his battalion helped set up . He climbed out again , asked one of the children to let him ride his bike , and sat on it for a minute , then gave it back to the kid . <p> When his military translator , Omar Elmenshawi , finally emerged from the 40th Street station , Wood 's first question to him was : " What 's it like in there ? " <p> The referendum results are still unknown , but most voters interviewed by The Chronicle in this Sunni stronghold on Saturday said they cast ballots against the charter , which proposes a federalist structure that could leave once-ruling Sunnis with little power and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Iraq 's 18 provinces vote " No , " then the first post-Hussein constitution will be defeated , making the political future of Iraq uncertain . <p> Wood said it was important that the many Sunni voters who stayed away from the polls during the National Assembly elections in January show up this time , joining Iraq 's political process . <p> " It certainly would have made the future of Iraq a little bit easier if they came together and agreed on the constitution , " said Wood , commander of the 2-7 Infantry Battalion , 1st Brigade , 3rd Infantry Division . " But if they do n't agree , it 's progress in and of itself , in terms of Iraqis participating and being heard . " <p> By the end of the day , more than 80 percent of 47,563 voters registered in Tikrit and its suburbs cast ballots , and no polling sites had been attacked . To Wood , votes of Iraqis like Mohammed were a validation of the work his soldiers had done over the last three months . <p> The 2-7 had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the voters in this volatile region . The soldiers had helped set up hundreds of concrete barriers and strung coils of concertina wire around the polling stations . They had rounded up suspected insurgents and advised local security forces on how to guard the polls . They had helped local election , police and Iraqi army officials move voting ballots . <p> For a week before the referendum , Wood 's soldiers traveled around the dusty desert in the Tigris River valley , checking on every polling station to make sure everything was in place , as the colonel coordinated cooperation between various Iraqi officials . <p> When election day finally came , Wood and his soldiers waited impatiently for these efforts to pay off . <p> They rolled out at dawn , just as the sun rose above the flat desert , tinting the sky in pink and orange . The streets of Tikrit were empty apart from Iraqi army pickup trucks and police cars . At 7:14 a.m. , Elmenshawi walked up to the soldiers ' first destination of the day , a polling station on Jumail Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen Iraqi police officers , their fingers purple with indelible ink , so far had been the only voters there . <p> " We 've still got time , " Wood said , reassuringly . " It 's too early . " Thirty minutes later , his convoy came across the first security scare of the day : a silvery gray object , slightly larger than a soda can , with protruding wires attached to what appeared to be batteries , lying on the road . The soldiers peered at it through binoculars , but the object was too far away to make out what it was . Suspecting that it might be a roadside bomb , they called for a team of military de-miners . <p> It turned out to be a harmless car-door mechanism that had been discarded in the middle of the road . <p> At the polling station on 40th Street at 10 a.m. , election workers discussed the referendum . <p> " My father voted ' Yes , ' as did my sister , who is a teacher of Arabic , " said Had Ismail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefited from this regime . She 's making much more money now than before , so she voted ' Yes . ' <p> " I voted ' No , ' " Ismail said . " This constitution is dividing Iraq , not making it stronger . Passing this constitution would be for Iraq like pouring water on a car tire  --  it will spin the country out of control . " <p> Abdul Wahab Ahmed , 58 , strode through the polling station with a smile on his face . He refused to say how he marked his ballot . <p> " I am a free man ; I can vote however I want to . That is why I 'm smiling , " he said . <p> Outside the polling station , Elmenshawi pointed at a two-story building across the road . " I remember doing a raid on this building right here , " he said . " Found a lot of upset civilians " inside . <p> In front of the polling site , a middle-age couple proudly demonstrated their stained index fingers to an Iraqi television journalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Finally , Wood got the news about voter turnout : 10,000 voters had cast their ballots in the first three hours of the day . <p> " Now we 're getting somewhere ! " he said . <p> At 11:20 a.m. , Wood 's convoy pulled over outside a polling station in Qadessiya , a northern suburb of Tikrit where date farms nestle on cliffs overlooking the Tigris River . <p> At the polling station , Muna Khalaf , 53 , had waited in line for an hour to cast her ballot . When her turn came , she voted " No . " <p> " This is the Iraqi constitution , and we have to be part of this process , " Khalaf said . " But we need democracy that brings Iraq together , not divides it . " <p> A block away , Wood was waiting again , pacing the dust around his vehicle . He had left his M4 rifle in the humvee . <p> " Playing it tough , " he explained . <p> An hour later , he learned that 20,000 Tikritis had voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At 2 p.m. , as the convoy drove down Highway 1 just south of Tikrit , Wood 's humvee stopped abruptly when he spotted a cardboard container that once held a dozen bottles of drinking water in the middle of the road . Soldiers fanned out , trying to get a better look at the box without coming too close to it . After a minute , Wood grabbed a shotgun from his humvee 's gunner and approached the box . About 20 yards away from it he stopped , raised the weapon , and fired into the box . The birdshot sounded hollow as it pierced the empty cardboard . Wood approached it , picked it up , and carried it to his humvee so that the box would not look like a potential roadside bomb to the next U.S. convoy passing through . <p> By 4 p.m. , of 564,000 voters registered in the north-central Salahuddin province , more than 405,000 people had voted . <p> " That 's pretty damn good , " Wood said with a smile . " They felt the need to vote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they have voted , potentially risking their lives . " <p> This morning , Wood would have to make sure all the ballot boxes made it safely to a large warehouse in southern Tikrit for counting . Then comes another wait , until the referendum results are announced early this week . <p> But after the end of election day on Saturday , Wood was planning to celebrate a day of bloodless voting in Tikrit . As his humvee drove through the checkpoint at the entrance to Forward Operating Base Remagen , where the 2-7 stays , Wood made an announcement to the soldiers in his truck : <p> " Tonight , we got victory cigars !
