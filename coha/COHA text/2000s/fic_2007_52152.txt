NINE DAYS BEFORE THEIR WEDDING , Mariana and Joseph had to fly down to Lima , then take an overnight coach to Ayaviri-the town where Mariana had grown up , nestled in the mountains of southeastern Peru , north of Lake Titicaca and not far from Cuzco-because her grandmother had suffered a stroke and was about to die . In the three years they had been together , Joseph had neither met Mariana 's family nor been to Peru , and had never expressed an interest in vacationing there , so she gave him credit for taking the trip in stride , dealing with the constant delays in their travels , and remaining calm when it turned out the seats they had purchased on the overnight coach had been sold twice . The Americans ( after eight years of living in the States , Mariana was now viewed as an American ; never mind the eighteen years she 'd spent in Peru ) were expected to buy out the laborers who had been sold the duplicate tickets , and Joseph did so , graciously , using the Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Peruvian pronunciation Mariana had been teaching him at home in St. Paul . Mariana let him take the window seat , so the children running up and down the aisle would bump against her , and so it was she who could refuse the insistent vendors who boarded the bus at each small town stop selling chide , naranjas , empanadas , or churros . For the better part of two days they were in transit , and , during most of that time , she was unable to contact her family to find out how her grandmother was doing . Mariana was concerned , anxious to see her grandmother before she died , and was considering postponing the wedding ; but most of her energy was spent watching Joseph , making sure he was never too uncomfortable or irritated , and this attention paid to her fianc probably made the uncertainty about her grandmother easier for her to deal with while she traveled . She was not watching him for signs of the man he would become , noticing and cataloguing how he reacted when under stress or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had become certain two months before he proposed , when he declined an executive job offer at a large medical engineering firm in a Cleveland suburb because he did n't think she wanted to leave St. Paul yet . He was older than she was by a decade and a half , established , brilliant , and charming . He would make a good father for their children and a caring , supportive husband . They arrived at Ayaviri in the very early morning and were picked up by Mariana 's father . Ernesto had been prepared to dislike Joseph , this American seeking his daughter 's hand in marriage , but when they met , Ernesto seemed pleasantly surprised . He welcomed them and told Mariana that her mother , aunt , and uncle had all stayed at the hospital through the night with their mother and that the doctor did not expect the old woman to survive the week . She was conscious only a few minutes a day , so her children stayed with her around the clock : No one knew which moment would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to go straight to the hospital , but Joseph and her father convinced her to wash up and get some sleep first . With the two of them imploring her to rest , she noticed how similar their expressions were when they were looking out for her best interests . " Of course , I did n't sleep at all , " Mariana said , as she removed her head from my shoulder . " I pictured my grandmother dying while I slept , only minutes away from her , missing her final breath after making such a long journey back home . " " Considering the condition you must have been in after all that traveling , " I joked , " it was probably for the best that Joseph forced you to shower . The woman was on the verge of death . " At that point I was still learning about her every time we were together . We met only in the afternoon , and on a sunny day the light came through the window in an isolated rectangle of warmth that slowly crawled up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the characteristic that infatuated me with her even more than her beauty did , would melt away as we lay in bed , allowing my lust to transform into love . Between lovemaking we took turns telling each other our dreams or stories from our childhoods . We never talked about a future together , and we never talked about her husband . I was therefore surprised and a little disturbed this time that she mentioned him . " Yes . That is funny , " she said , and rolled over to look through her bag , which sat on the floor on her side of the bed . She came up with her pack of ultra-light cigarettes and a small silver lighter . " You are funny , " she said , shaking her shining black hair clear of her face and placing a cigarette between her teeth . Before she could light it , I leaned into her and kissed her , saying , " That 's why you love me . " Her earring clicked against my teeth as I nipped at her earlobe . Except when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind her thick hair , so I was surprised by how perfect they seemed-twisting like a labyrinth in and around , a Mbius strip of caramel skin always concealing another hidden recess . She waited patiently for me to finish before lighting the cigarette . Only later did I conclude that these pauses-these cigarette-lighting , **28;2535;TOOLONG pauses-were held so I would figure out something she was n't saying , but our affair was still new enough that the things I understood about her were the physical ones : how to let her guide me with her body where she wanted to be touched , or how to hear in her breathing whether she wanted to be kissed or bitten . I wanted to know more-wanted to know everything-but most of her was still a mystery . " But he did n't force me , dearest , " she finally said , exhaling . " IfI had wanted to go without bathing , he would not have stopped me . You would prefer if he had , no ? " Of course I would . Like any lover of a married woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as extraordinary , unsullied by the compromises and daily brutalities of marriage . So I sought out evidence of precisely these things in her married life , hoping to improve her impression of our affair by shining on her marriage the harsh light of unfavorable comparison . But I hated that my motives , even so early in our relationship , were this transparent to her . I had to deny it . " What your husband did twenty years ago has nothing to do with me , " I said , laying my head back down on the pillow and rolling halfway over to look at her . " Twenty years is nothing , " she said , then inhaled and clipped the ashes from her cigarette into the empty beer can she used for an ashtray . " It is no time at all . " Despite Mariana 's anxiety , her grandmother did n't die that day , and Ernesto brought Mariana and Joseph to the hospital , where Joseph , who had met none of these people before , was introduced to the dying woman 's three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her Aunt Cissy . The men decided that , as she was the first of the grandchildren and had been very close to her grandmother before she left for university , Mariana would spend most of her time at the hospital . Ernesto and Joseph would serve as chauffeurs for anyone who needed a ride to or from the bus station , the hospital , or home , and would otherwise seek whatever diversion suited them . Mariana 's time at the hospital consisted of long stretches of quiet boredom interrupted by brief moments of high tension . Most of the time , the four of them sat in the private room and read whatever book or magazine they each had at hand . Occasionally , heated exchanges would break out between the siblings-mostly between Aunt Cissy and Uncle Pedro , but sometimes her mother was involved as well . In savage whispers , Aunt Cissy would blame Uncle Pedro for their mother 's condition , and Pedro would defend himself . Marianas mother 's position was harder to discern . She seemed equally angry at both her brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece it together , but Mariana discovered there had been a disagreement among the siblings about where to send their mother for treatment . Her mother and Aunt Cissy wanted , at the first sign of a blood clot in the brain , to send her grandmother to a hospital in Lima . Uncle Pedro had insisted on keeping her in town , near the family . Pedro had the final say because he was the firstborn son . This also made him vulnerable to Aunt Cissy 's charge of caring more about his inheritance than his own mother 's health . The hospital in Lima would have been very expensive , perhaps forcing Pedro to sell some of the land on which the family relied for their income . He insisted his decision was based on the dying woman 's wishes to be near her family in her final days . By the time Mariana arrived , the argument was moot . All they could do was keep her grandmother comfortable with medication and company . Meanwhile , Joseph and Ernesto were spending all their time together . Perhaps it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven years older than her future husband-or perhaps it derived from a shared view of the world , but they became very close in those days . Mariana and Joseph would never speak about what exactly he and her father had been doing . During their time in Peru , when they were n't talking about Mariana 's grandmother , most of their conversations were about their upcoming wedding ; after the honeymoon , when they began to settle into their lives and Mariana thought to ask him about it , she felt the time had passed . Their marriage was still young , as was she , and she did n't want him to think she was jealous . From stories the men told afterward , she knew they had gone to see a game of football , and they had done a lot of drinking , regardless of their chauffeuring duties . Ernesto showed Joseph the family property-the storefronts and homes they rented out in town , as well as the terraced land they leased to small farmers higher up on the mountainside . Joseph seemed to find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later with the comment that the Italian Alps were lovely , but not as striking as the mountains of Peru . An interest in Peruvian culture took root in Joseph during those days with Ernesto , so that on occasion he would ask , with only the slightest note of condescension , if she would cook for him a Peruvian dish she had never before prepared . She could often guess at which restaurant he had first tried it . Most of the time she would attempt to cook the meal , but then he asked for guinea pig , and she became certain he was making fun of her . Long before Mariana had even met her future husband , she suspected that her father supported a mistress . The grandson of Spanish immigrants , Ernesto was born and educated in Lima . Only the lure of marrying into a wealthy landowning family brought him to Ayaviri . He was easily bored there , and made this clear to his wife . A mistress would have seemed to him a good and proper solution to the problem . Mariana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his future son-in-law , though , until five or six years into their marriage , when Joseph suggested , while they were making love , that they do something they had never done before . While she did n't consider herself sexually nave , she was momentarily stunned . Joseph responded to her hesitation by saying that all Peruvian women pretended to be chaste , but he knew what they were really like . She took it as a jest on his part , given the lightness of his tone , yet she later began to wonder how he had meant it-how he had come by it-after she realized the phrase he had used was a rough translation of something her father , in the same half-playful tone , often said . She grew suspicious of all the time her father and husband had spent together , away from the watchful eyes of family . " So I began to worry , " she said to me . " Joseph always considered himself sophisticated . Obviously , my father thought the same of himself-his whole identity was based on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . Had Joseph made love with another woman only a week before our wedding , making a joke of our vows before we had even said them ? And all while I was praying over my dying grandmother ? Could it have been my fathers mistress ? Would he betray me , and my father betray my mother , with the same woman ? " When she said that , my stomach began to knot up . " I think I know what Joseph suggested , " I told her . " If I 'm right , we did the same thing just last week . " I rubbed her belly when I said this , to let her know I was joking . She refused to play along . We had been meeting at my apartment for two months by then , what I lightly called " the afternoon shift . " We had just finished making love when she started telling the story . There was no introduction , no context . With her head on my shoulder , rubbing the backs of her fingers against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first I could n't understand why , though I was happy enough just to listen in the warm isolation of my bedroom . But with this talk about her husband , it sounded like it was turning into a story justifying our affair . I wanted to tell her to shut up , make her play along with my jokes-anything to stop her from doing this . But how could I ? We all tell stories to ourselves , and to others , and if this one permitted her to continue the affair without being wracked by guilt , why should I prevent it ? To me , the feelings justified themselves-in this space we had created , we were sharing something beautiful and true , and the outside world did n't really matter . Love justifies itself , I thought , husband or no . But this was n't about me . " Do you think he really did anything ? " I asked . " You have to understand , in my culture it 's not unusual . But how can I know ? I could have asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , waving her right hand to encompass me , her , the bed , my whole apartment , " I can not ask . " We lay on the bed in silence for a while . Eventually I had to speak . " This is n't like that , " I said . " It may not be perfect ... " I could n't think how to finish the sentence . She took my chin between her fingers and pulled me over to face her . She looked at me , first staring at my right eye , then my left , then back at my right . She smiled and her eyes lost their hardness . She kissed me over and over , saying " my . . . sweet ... boy " and " of ... course ... my ... darling " between kisses . But her conjectures all came later . Mariana had not been deeply interested in what Joseph and Ernesto were doing while she was at the hospital . Her grandmother was her concern , and she stayed with her , prayed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her grandmother became conscious enough to speak . On the first , she confused Mariana with her mother . On the second , she was more coherent , named everyone in the room , and referred to others who were n't there , relatives dead twenty or thirty years . Mariana told her she loved her , and her grandmother seemed to understand . For this , Mariana was grateful . The visit lasted just four days but seemed much longer to Mariana . She slept intermittently , never for more than a few hours at a time . She was brought to her parents " home daily to bathe and to eat one home-cooked meal . Otherwise , she ate what she could at the hospital , either in her grandmother 's room or in the cafeteria . At her wedding everyone would say she looked fantastic , but it was because she had lost six pounds in Peru . At one point during those sad four days , she and Joseph spoke about postponing the wedding . She resisted leaving her grandmother , but Joseph argued that their wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for friends and family who had booked flights . But he was n't insistent . He recognized how hard this decision was for her and only wanted what was best for everyone . She loved him all the more for the sensitive way he balanced practical considerations against her feelings . He never made her feel irrational or unreasonable . Only after Mariana spoke with her grandmother the second time-when she was confident her grandmother had understood her when she said she loved hershe and Joseph decided to fly home and hold the wedding as scheduled . Joseph purchased tickets so that Mariana , her parents , and he would arrive in Minnesota two days before the wedding ; he told his sister , who had been taking care of all the arrangements while they were in Peru , that everything would proceed as scheduled . Everyone was disappointed to think Mariana and her parents would miss the funeral , but this compromise seemed like the best course of action . Then very early on the morning after Joseph had bought the tickets , Mariana 's grandmother passed away . Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Joseph , Mariana , and her parents could attend before they had to fly to the States . Pedro saw the funeral as his opportunity to prove his concern had never been about his inheritance , but only about what was best for his mother . He had been pierced by Aunt Cissy 's accusations . Even through her sadness , Mariana could see how much attention her uncle had paid to the arrangements . The funeral mass was somber and crowded . Uncle Pedro had relayed to the presiding priest stories about his and his sisters " childhood ; he had made sure the priest understood how important her grandchildren had been to his mother and insisted the eulogy make special mention of Mariana and the bittersweet wedding she would soon be celebrating . The birch casket he had purchased was spectacular-with elaborate carvings and a thick coating of lacquer , it was magnificent in the powerful sun common even in the morning at that high altitude . Crowning it all , though , was the hearse . When it pulled up to the church , the crowd gasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its bumpers and hubcaps was eclipsed by the richness and depth of the black paint covering the rest of it . To everyone present it embodied the profound respect this old woman had enjoyed . It brought dignity and majesty to the hastily arranged funeral . After Pedro and the other pallbearers slid the coffin into the back of the car , Aunt Cissy rushed over and hugged him , weeping , begging him to forgive her her harsh words . Uncle Pedro , crying as well , did so . " Nearly everyone who saw this was swept away , " Mariana said . " I thought the arguments between my uncle and my aunt had been going on behind closed doors , but I was wrong . The whole town knew . To see them kiss like that and forgive each other , after the months of grandmother 's illness and all the stress , not to mention the passing of this woman so loved by everyone-it was too much for a heart to bear . " I imagined the scene : the gleaming black hearse in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying , forgiving slights and insults , finally expressing the love they 'd been taking for granted . In a messy and sad world , Marianas story said to me , you struggle to find the fleeting moments of love , and then you hold on to them as tightly as you can . This is the only way to live a life . I reached over and hugged Mariana tightly , interrupting what she was about to say . " That 's beautiful , " I said , almost crying , and nestled my head into the hollow of her left shoulder . She scratched my scalp with her long fingernails . I wondered what she was thinking , whether she was feeling what I was feeling . Emotion was surging through me , seeking release . I wanted to cry . I wanted to sing . I wanted to make love again . I wanted to celebrate the space we had made together , this tiny universe of love without past or future , all present , overflowing with tenderness . " Yes , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " Like this . " She looked at me without expression , as if I were a stranger sitting across from her on a bus , wearing an interesting hat . " How do you mean ? " " Well , " I said , struggling for words , " this is n't perfect , this arrangement we havehow we have to sneak around-but we 're taking it and turning it into something good . " When her look did n't change , I added , " Like after the funeral , with Pedro and Cissy . " " Oh , my sweet , " she said , and pulled even farther away , as if to encompass all of me within her gaze . " To you this is romantic . I understand that . But for me even to be here means my life has gone to shit . It 's not romantic-it 's sordid . " I half-turned away from her and sat up , then reaching for the first thing I could find , said , " But Joseph cheated on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroke my head , but I dodged her hand . " Perhaps it was just insecurity . A young bride 's imagination . I thought hearing it would make you feel better . " The surge of emotion had dried up , and all I felt was my skin , between me and the world . A draft from the barely opened window blew across my left shoulder . The hair on my back and my neck stood up . It was getting late , and the shaft of sunlight from the window had moved off the bed and onto the floor where I could n't see it . " It did n't , " I said . " How could it ? " " You interrupted me , my love , " she said , and looked at me with sympathy . " I have n't finished . " After the crying and hugging , they all got in their cars and followed the hearse to the cemetery . It was a long drive because they wanted to avoid the dirt roads . Everyone was quiet following the great outpouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been driving for half an hour when , for some reason , the cars ahead of them stopped . They were close to the cemetery , within sight of the gates . Ernesto got out and went to see what the trouble was . When he had n't returned after five minutes , the rest of them , with Joseph leading the way , went to see what was going on . When Ernesto saw Joseph , he called him over , already laughing . He told him something Mariana could n't hear , and Joseph began laughing as well . The two of them , in nearly identical black suits , could barely remain standing they were laughing so hard . Mariana and her mother caught up , and Ernesto told them what had happened . Four hundred meters short of the cemetery , the hearse had run out of gas . The pallbearers would have to carry the coffin up the road , then wind through the cemetery on foot all the way to the grave site . Mariana 's mother looked at Ernesto with poison in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't yet understand . Mariana looked over at her Uncle Pedro . He was stunned . He had arranged everything-the mass , the eulogy , the coffin , the hearse-and it had all been beautiful . But because of a stupid , simple oversight , it was all ruined . She stood there , caught between the callous and imbecilic laughter of Joseph and Ernesto and the shocked stupor of her uncle , and could n't decide whether her responsibility at that moment was to scold or to comfort . After seeing what she thought to be the greater need , Mariana left her future husband laughing next to her father and went over to console her uncle . " All these men around me with their infantile needs , " Mariana said . " And for what in return ? " She took another cigarette out of her pack . " I should have gone to my mother . " She pulled her hair back off her face and lighted the cigarette . Her ear , though still perfect in size and shape , this time looked inhuman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rip it off and throw it away . It 's not as though that afternoon ended our affair . Far from it . We even made love again before she left . She did it to comfort me , and it worked . We continued to see each other one or two afternoons a week , when our schedules allowed it . She was too beautiful and too experienced for a kid like me to refuse . I 'm not sure what kept her in it . It was changing , though , and we could both feel it . I dated several women my own age during that time . Looking back , I think I treated them badly . But , then , they let me . We always met up at night , and the joking idea that my affair with Mariana was just the afternoon shift now became as real for me as it had always been for her . She killed my fascination the afternoon she told me that story . I could n't believe or pretend anymore that what we were doing was any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city . It 's a lesson we all have to learn , I guess , but I could n't thank her for it . I was still seeing Mariana when I met Samantha , the woman I would eventually marry . On our last afternoon together , I started rushing Mariana out immediately after we were done having sex . I had started feeling guilty about sleeping with both of them on the same day , and was trying at least to get as much time between them as I could . As she dressed , I neatened my apartment-emptying the beer can ashtray , spraying Lysol to get the smell of her cigarettes and her perfume out of the air , washing the waxy lipstick off her wineglass . I looked over to Mariana and felt a stabbing nostalgia in my gut as she put on her stockings . She had , even then , such a pull over me that I almost dropped everything and rushed over to her . But I did n't . She looked up and caught me staring . She saw , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She smiled with half her mouth but not her eyes , and ran her fingers through her hair to straighten it . I caught a final glimpse of her ear . She put on her shoes and came over to me . She held my chin gently in her fingers and looked straight into my eyes . Maybe it was the taint of the nostalgia I had felt earlier , or maybe it 's just my looking back now , but when she said , " Good-bye , my love , " I think she meant it .
