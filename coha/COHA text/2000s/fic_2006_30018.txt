Not So Snow White By Donna Kauffman Random House Donna Kauffman Yes , Alden , I know I 'm no longer on the tour , but- " Tess Hamilton bit her lip and , more firmly , her tongue as the Nike marketing rep continued talking over her . For Tess , not talking when she had something to say-and she had a whole lot of things to say at the moment-was like trying not to breathe . She ripped her Boxster S convertible across three lanes of traffic on I-4 , ignoring the honks and shouted commentary regarding her driving skills . She had to make her exit , right ? Besides , at the moment , she had far bigger things to worry about than instigating inadvertent road rage . Lord knew she 'd been responsible for far worse and lived to tell the tale . The rep paused for an infinitesimal breath and Tess leaped in . " I appreciate what you 're saying , really , I do , but this is shortsighted thinking . " She raised her voice to be heard over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving with the top down . Of course , shouting suited her rising temper at the moment , too . " We 're moving in new directions , Tess . So we 're looking for a different kind of image . We need to stay fresh . I 'm sure you understand . " No , she did n't understand . She refused to understand . She was no longer fresh ? Well , shit , how mortifying was that ? Not even thirty years old , and her shelf life had already expired ? Sheaccelerated , going way too fast down the winding suburban road leading to her home in the elite , gated , Boca Raton community of Sea Spar . A home she loved . A home she 'd bought and paid for with her own hard-earned income . Income which , since her career-ending injury the summer before last , had rapidly ceased to match her outgo . Mostly because of shortsighted morons like the marketing rep currently droning on in her headset about focus groups and future percentages . She took a sharp turn without decelerating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper in check . Unlike past run-ins with various sponsors and marketing reps , this was n't about some stupid tabloid headline or missed promotional event . She could have talked her way out of that . . . and often had . Too often . No , this time her entire life was on the line . What was left of it , anyway . And okay , sure , maybe that was partly due to the fact that she so often had spoken out when it would have been smarter to shut up . Financially smarter , at least . She was a firm believer that if more people spoke their mind instead of blowing smoke up people 's asses and saying what they thought everyone wanted to hear , the world would be a much better place . But it was n't like her sponsors had n't known that when they signed on the dotted line with her . It had n't mattered to them then . However , as the condescending , very annoying man on the other end of the phone was making unavoidably and quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot right now . She tapped her horn as she turned into the lavishly landscaped , stone-and-wrought-iron entrance , alerting Saul , the gate guard , of her impending arrival . She barely slowed as the bar began to rise , having to duck her head just slightly to keep it from catching on the brim of her tennis hat . She caught a glimpse of Saul , shaking his balding head as he always did when she zipped past , a blur of midnight blue and chrome . This time she did n't wave or blow an apologetic kiss they both knew was completely insincere . Not that she did n't have a soft spot for Saul , she just was n't particularly remorseful about her no-prisoners style of driving . And she was pretty sure Saul secretly admired her for that . She passed a string of long , winding driveways leading to this sprawling mansion or that , paying them no attention whatsoever , until she finally turned into her own drive . She slowed slightly , her attention snagging as it always did now , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally beautiful , perfect house . She 'd spent countless hours on those courts . Alden took another breath and Tess took advantage again , struggling mightily to keep her voice calm , her tone even . " Your company originally signed on with me , in part , because I was media bait ! " Okay , so maybe she needed to work a little harder on the calm , even part . But honestly , had there ever really been a chance that she 'd have kept her cool ? The man was robbing her blind here . And hell , she still had n't recovered from the mauling she 'd taken at the hands of good old Uncle Sam over that whole income tax fiasco last year . Then there was this past April 's tab . . . yeesh . She might as well have been bending over when she saw the figure on the bottom line . She did n't even want to think about next year . . . and she would n't have to if Alden here would just get with the program . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't exactly been up on the latest tax codes , or knew anything about what payment was due when . That was her accountant 's job . Yes , yes , she had fired the man before the extension due date last summer-well , he claimed he quit , but that was semantics , really . And she had n't even known about the damn extension , much less the due date . Of course , it was true he 'd been pestering her for some time about a number of things that needed her attention , but she 'd been focused on rehabbing her shoulder , mentally grappling with not being on the tour , dealing with the dawning reality that she 'd probably never be going back , with having to retire before she was ready . . . Suffice it to say , it had been a really rough year . And the government had so not been understanding about that fact . A lot like certain members of her family . And now May was almost over , a new year almost half done , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still upside down , emotionally and financially , and she could n't seem to find a way to balance it again . Which , admittedly , was why she and her accountant had had the falling out in the first place . He 'd actually had the nerve to lecture her on developing proper postretirement spending habits ! She 'd laughed . Well , she was n't laughing now . And restraining her natural spirit-okay , temper-was n't what put those ten grand-slam trophies on her mantelpiece , now , was it ? " Alden , you know as well as I do that it was my face , my temperament on court and off , and my winning record that lined your company 's pockets all those years . " Gripping her cell phone so tightly it was a miracle it did n't snap in two , she slammed out of her car and stalked past the other three vehicles filling her four-car garage , before automatically punching in the security code and striding into her house . She stopped at the floor-to-ceiling picture window that made up the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a little over a year . " " Almost two years , " Alden mildly corrected . " Twenty-one months since the injury , " she shot back . " I only officially retired last September . " That press conference had been exactly two days before the first lovely letter from the IRS had shown up . Talk about a bad week . " You 've been off the tour for two seasons , Tess . Two years in the tennis world is a long time when you 're never coming back . " " I was number one for sixty-one straight weeks , and still top five when I went out , against girls a decade younger than me . People have n't exactly forgotten me . " " Martina Hingis , " he said , adopting a slightly harder edge to his tone . " Monica Seles . Both former number ones , both multiple grand-slam winners , both retired before their time . How long afterward were you seeing their faces launching new ad campaigns ? " He did n't wait for her to answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a very competitive marketplace , Tess , you know that . We have to stay on the cutting edge of whatever sport we 're associating with our product . And that means- " " Snagging fresh meat , " Tess snapped . " I get that . I know this is business , Alden . It 's business for me , too . Something you seem to have overlooked here . I 've held up my end all these years . Whatever happened to loyalty ? " Alden sighed deeply . " The fact that I 'm speaking to you directly , and not your agent or manager , should tell you all you need to know . " " My management team did n't drop me , I dropped them ! " Okay , so maybe that was stretching things a little . The official word was that they 'd amicably agreed to part ways . What that really meant was that they 'd found out about the heavy hit she 'd taken as a result of last year 's tax debacle-which she 'd paid in full , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out of the press , but still , it should n't have affected her viability as an asset to the agency . So what if she 'd had to liquidate a few assets ? Okay , more than a few . Okay , almost all of them . But honestly , some of them she had n't even remembered she 'd owned . An indication right there-outwardly , anyway-that things were n't that bad . Maybe to some people 's way of thinking , the tax debt had been kind of big . . . okay , so it had been close to eight figures . Her accountant had n't been kidding about her neglect of certain business issues . Still , to her , that was n't as big a deal as it might have been to some . Lesson learned . She 'd just earn it back and be smarter next time . Offers poured in every day . Or they used to , but still , it would happen , she 'd recover . And did n't she deserve some credit for paying it all off ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard sale to come up with that kind of money . Did they have any idea how personally humiliating that had been ? How hard to keep it out of the public eye ? Like she needed more stress . And yes , so her continued tangled financial picture had n't been encouraging , what with April 15 rolling around almost right after she 'd gotten done making the first payoff . With nothing new coming in , she 'd had another little liquidation sale , and yes , it had zapped pretty much everything she had left . But all she needed was one or two little endorsement deals to get started , not too much to ask , to her way of thinking . She just wanted to keep a roof over her head . One roof ! She 'd sold all the others , had n't she ? Was it her fault the deals were n't being renewed ? She 'd placed that blame squarely on the agency . It was their job to get them to sign her , was n't it ? And they were mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic . The bottom line was that they 'd amicably agreed to sign a confidentiality statement saying they 'd keep her less-than-flattering financial picture under wraps . . . as long as she agreed to terminate her contract with them effective immediately . Almost a year before it was due to expire . Of course , she 'd left their offices smugly certain she 'd find new representation immediately . She always had before . So she 'd lost a few contracts , so what ? When the big boys came calling , renewing her major endorsement deals , every agency on both coasts would be begging to represent her again . Which would have been supremely satisfying if it had happened that way . But here she was , still without representation . And Alden as her last hope . Yippee . And he was making it sound like , during the short time span from her injury to now , an entire era had passed her by . So . Time to change tactics . She was all for histrionics if they were going to pay off , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like on the court , when something was n't working , you either changed your game , or you went home early . Perhaps now was the time to be a tad more conciliatory . Show that she understood the gravity of the situation . Lord knows it was pretty damn grave . " Alden , " she said , forcing sweetness into her voice , " what if I fly to New York and we all sit down and discuss this , toss around a few ideas . Your company is known for being innovative . We just need to think outside the box a little . Shake things up . " " I do n't think that 's going to work for us , Tess . I 'm sorry . " Staring down at her empty tennis courts , she finally ducked her chin and squeezed her eyes shut as she tried to come up with the right thing to say . She rubbed her fingers across her eyes , surprised to find they came away damp . Which pissed her off all over again . Panic was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a handwringer and she did n't plan on starting now . She was a fighter , dammit . " You 're walking away from a good thing , Alden , " she said firmly , hoping he mistook the slight hoarse edge in her voice for restrained temper . She tried to convince herself of that , too . " Now that I 'm a free agent , someone else is going to step up and reap those rewards . " " I wish you all the best , Tess , " was all he said . " I really do . " Then the line went dead . Tess clicked the phone off , and barely resisted the urge to fling it full force at the plate glass . It was quite probable that Alden knew damn well there was n't anyone else waiting in the wings to snap her up for a new deal . For all its international stature , the tennis industry was a tight little community . One where everybody knew everybody else 's business , not to mention their dirty laundry . Since announcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make damn sure nobody knew hers . Judging by the questions the media shouted her way when she attended this event or that , she 'd been mostly successful . But that could n't last much longer . It was all about appearances and public perception . As long as the public thought she was still a winner , still a success story , still a hot property , then she was one . It was as simple as that , and as complicated as that . But she 'd always been a winner . That part had been easy for her . Only now there was nothing for her to win . And the companies who 'd signed her to represent their products for the past decade were naming new faces . Fresher faces . Her window of income opportunity was rapidly shrinking and public perception could shift on a dime . Maybe she 'd been shortsighted in assuming her endorsement deals would continue to finance her cash flow , but it was too late to shift gears now . Besides , what else was there ? Two years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively imminent , but not immediate . She 'd thought she 'd have a few years to plan things out , to think ahead , make sure she was secure when she left the tour behind , future plans all laid out . Well , her shoulder had had other ideas . One flying lunge on the hard courts at the U.S. Open the summer before last had changed everything . She 'd landed smack down on her right shoulder , her serving shoulder , decimating the previous three repair jobs and abruptly ending her career . Not that she 'd initially accepted that assessment . Or that of the surgeon who had tried his best to repair the damage one more time . Continues ...
