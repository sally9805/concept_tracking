The Legacy of Abraham <P> " Because Muslims , Christians and Jews all claim Abraham as their father , are Americans supposed to forget about Sept. 11 ? " Bob Franz Placentia , Calif . <P> As an American Muslim , I greatly appreciated your article on Abraham RELIGION , Sept. 30 . It was thought provoking and opened my eyes to connections among the three great faiths . It was nice to read something that did n't vilify Islam and the Muslim tradition . Articles like this make me feel there are reasonable , objective people out there who are willing to accept their differences in order to understand the commonalities . Faiz Faseehuddin Nashville , Tenn . <P> What makes anyone think that Christians , Muslims and Jews can unite behind any man , when they can not live in peace under the one true God they all believe in ? The search for peace through Abraham will lead only along the path we have already traveled  --  to disagreements , discord and strife .

Rabbi Richard Hirsh Wyncote , Pa . <P> It is misleading to think the current conflict in the Holy Land is a continuation of the mythic struggle between Abraham 's sons . There is nothing holy about savage bloodshed that has destroyed generations of innocent lives for the sole purpose of maintaining political power and control of land and water . Makram Talih New Haven , Conn . <P> When Jews , Christians and Muslims shed their exclusive claims on Abraham and recognize that he is the patriarch of all three faiths , maybe these cousins can coexist in peace . But that requires courage and compassion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jose , Calif . <P> If God were to speak to Muslims , Christians and Jews today , would the message be any different from the one given to Abraham at the moment he was about to take his son 's life ? If God constrained Abraham from killing his son , are n't we , as children of Abraham , also forbidden to kill one another ? William Dodd Brown Chicago <P> I wonder what response God would have received had he asked Isaac 's mother Sarah to take her son 's life . If any God asked me to sacrifice one of my two sons , even if it were only a sadistic test of my devotion , I would say that such a God is not worthy of being worshipped . Joanne Mitchell Rochester , N.Y . <P> Your reporting on Abraham was evenhanded and perceptive . It is certainly the right of anyone to seek interfaith understanding . For those of us who believe there is only one way to please God , however , the key to maintaining harmony among competing faiths is a democratic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious beliefs .
