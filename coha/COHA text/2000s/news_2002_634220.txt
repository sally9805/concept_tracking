<p> We have finally met defeat . A film has resisted our efforts to pound it into submission . Every year I join some 1,000 students and townspeople here at the University of Colorado on a five-day , 12-hour , shot-by-shot trek through a film . Using the freeze-frame and slow-motion features of a DVD , we track down symbols , expose hidden messages , analyze visual strategies , expose special effects , and in general , satisfy ourselves that we have extracted every fugitive scrap of meaning from the movie under discussion . <p> This year the target was David Lynch 's " Mulholland Drive . " It is a film I greatly admire , and indeed it was on my Top 10 list for 2001 . I still admire it , perhaps more than before . But I also find it more of a mystery . Here at the Conference on World Affairs , we gathered in Macky Auditorium every afternoon to look at the film together . We were sitting in the dark , so the voices were anonymous . Anyone in the hall could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeze-frame the film and discuss what the shouter found intriguing . ( This process was named " Cinema Interruptus " by the late Professor Howard Higman , founder of the conference . ) <p> Because I 've been doing this at Boulder for 30 years , the audience includes seasoned veterans . Not much eludes our collective mind and eye . We 've looked at classics like " Citizen Kane , " " Vertigo " and " The Third Man , " modern masterpieces like " Raging Bull , " " The Silence of the Lambs " and " Pulp Fiction , " foreign landmarks like " La Dolce Vita " and " Persona , " and contentious films like " Fight Club "  --  last year 's selection , a film I remained convinced , at the end of the week , consisted of two brilliant acts and a broken ending . <p> This year I chose " Mulholland Drive " ( which was released last week on DVD and video ) because I wanted to get to the bottom of its dream images and shifting realities . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I wrote in my original review . " ' Mulholland Drive ' is n't like ' Memento , ' where if you watch it closely enough , you can hope to explain the mystery . " <p> Analysis of the film ranges all the way from " it 's all a dream " to a 6,000-word dissection on Salon.com that attempts to account for every scene ( although even Salon , confronted with the movie 's mysterious little blue box , admitted , " We do n't know about the box " ) . <p> In my review , I wrote , " ' Mulholland Drive ' is all dream . There is nothing that is intended to be a waking moment . Like real dreams , it does not explain , does not complete its sequences , lingers over what it finds fascinating , dismisses unpromising plot lines . If you want an explanation for the last half hour of the film , think of it as the dreamer rising slowly to consciousness , as threads from the dream fight for space with recent memories from real life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those still in development . " <p> Did I still believe this at the end of the week ? Yes , and definitely no . The last half hour of the film does suggest a level of reality , although I still believe that real life and fragments of dream are interconnected . The more times you watch the film , the more the buried structure reveals itself . At the most basic level , I believe " Mulholland Drive " involves a failed blond actress named Diane Selwyn , disappointed in love by a brunet woman , who hires a hit man to kill her . Neither Diane nor her lover looks the same at the reality level as at the dream level , although the blond actress is played all the way through by Naomi Watts . <p> Most of the movie involves Selwyn 's dreams or nightmares , in which she appears as a chirpy young actress named Betty . Her brunet love in the dreams is a slinky ' 40s-style sexpot named Rita ( played by Laura Elena Harring ) . In the dreams , Betty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amnesiac sexpot from a Rita Hayworth movie poster ) investigate Rita 's missing identity , Nancy Drew-style , and become involved , at various levels of reality , with the casting and production of a movie . There is also material about gangsters who are dictating a casting choice to the film 's director ( Justin Theroux ) . There are scenes at which neither " Betty " nor " Rita " is present ; there is a haunting performance in a nightclub ; there is a monstrous homeless man ( played by a woman ) behind a diner where several crucial conversations take place ; musical numbers are performed ; a decomposing corpse makes an appearance ; a man in a wheelchair wields great power ; a cheery elderly couple turn up later , reduced to cockroach-size , and there are two lesbian scenes of unusual frankness for today 's Hollywood  --  perhaps because one is Diane Selwyn 's erotic dream , and the other her masturbatory fantasy . <p> Well , yes , you 're thinking , I 've seen the movie , so tell me something new . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unable to do by the end of the week . Having trekked through " Mulholland Drive " in great detail , I confess myself still outside looking in . I speak for many of my fellow Interrupti , whose interpretations ranged from " her life is flashing before her eyes at the moment of death " to " it 's a version of the Odyssey , with every character corresponding to a character in Greek mythology . " <p> In short : " Mulholland Drive " resists , defies and finally defeats logical explanation . It is impossible to produce a consistent precis of the film that accounts for everything . And there is an admirable reason for this : Like a dream , it does not have to make sense . <p> And yet the movie still plays like a movie . Every individual sequence is satisfactory and effective in and of itself . It 's just that they resist efforts to make them neatly add up . Often we seem to watch fragments of other movies , or threads of this one never completed . An early conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhythm of a police procedural , but then the cops never turn up again . The first lesbian scene is moody and erotic ( and contains the movie 's best laugh ) , but later we suspect that both of the women in the scene may in fact be the same woman  --  that Betty is Diane 's dream-self , and Rita is a Betty-fantasy replacing Diane 's real-life partner , who is not as attractive . <p> In our shot-by-shot progress , we found many details I had not seen before . Consider the mysterious man in the wheelchair . He is played by Michael J. Anderson , who is 43 inches tall . But is the man in the wheelchair a dwarf ? Or is the body in the wheelchair a fake , with Anderson standing behind it , his face positioned atop the dummy 's shirt collar ? That 's what someone suggested . We looked at it several times . Looks like it could be possible . <p> Something else we spotted : In a closing scene , as Diane reaches into a bureau drawer to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the mysterious blue box . Earlier in the film , this box is introduced with a triangular blue key . In one of the " real " scenes , a hit man tells Diane that when she finds a blue key ( not the same one ) , she will know the hit has taken place . Perhaps the blue box represents no secrets , but is simply a possession which Diane 's dream combines with a blue key to symbolize the death she has paid for . And the monster behind the diner , who has the blue box in its paper bag , may be a displaced form of the decomposing corpse that Betty and Rita find in the dream , and that Diane imagines is the result of the hit ? ( Unless , of course , that is Diane 's corpse . ) <p> And so on . One clue to the movie may be the confusing number of blond actresses . Naomi Watts plays Betty and Diane , who look so different ( Salon.com notes ) that Watts deserves praise for creating such different appearances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Diane Selwyn , who is not played by Watts ( although the dreamer may have transferred her own name to the waitresses ' name tag ) . And a singer in an audition scene who looks confusingly like Betty , but is n't . <p> I mention all these blonds not to explain them , but to remind us of a 1977 Luis Bunuel film named " That Obscure Object of Desire , " in which two different actresses interchangeably played the heroine , with no explanation , and without any of the other characters noticing . Bunuel was a surrealist , and Lynch 's work has always suggested that he treasures him . Perhaps " Mulholland Drive " can be seen as the first surrealist film of the 21st century . <p> I suspect the best way to appreciate " Mulholland Drive " is simply to experience it as a series of scenes , each one with a power and consistency of its own , that do not " add up " to a logical plot summary , or can not be reduced to an explanation  --  although various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaporate . As we all staggered out at the end of our Boulder odyssey , that seemed to be the consensus  --  although I am still getting e-mails from people who have suddenly figured it all out . <p> To read Roger Ebert 's original review of " Mullholland Drive , " go to suntimes.com/ebert
