When you have to kill the same terrorist twice in one week , then there 's either something wrong with your skills or something wrong with your world . <p> And there 's nothing wrong with my skills . <p> <p> CHAPTER TWO <p> Ocean City , Maryland / Saturday , June 27 ; 10:22 am <p> <p> They came for me at the beach . Nice and slick , two in front , one big cover-man behind in a three-point close while I was reaching for my car door . Nothing flashy , just three big guys in off-the-rack gray , all of them sweating in the Ocean City heat . <p> The pointman held up his hands in a no-problem gesture . It was a hot Saturday morning and I was in swim-trunks and a Hawaiian shirt with mermaids on it over a Tom Petty t-shirt . Flip-flops and Wayfarers . My piece was in a locked toolbox in the trunk , with a trigger guard clamped on it . I was at the beach to look at this year 's crop of sun-bunnies and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday morning officer-involved discussion with the OIS team . It had been a bad scene at the warehouse and they 'd put me on administrative leave to give me time to get my head straight about the shootings . I was n't expecting trouble , there should n't have been trouble , and the smooth way these guys boxed me was designed to keep everyone 's emotions in neutral . I could n't have done it better myself . <p> " Mr. Ledger ... ? " <p> " Detective Ledger , " I said to be pissy . <p> No trace of a smile on the point-guy 's face , only a millimeter of a nod . He had a head like a bucket . <p> " We 'd like you to come with us , " he said . <p> " Badge me or buzz off . " <p> Bucket-head gave me the look , but he pulled out an FBI identification case and held it up . I stopped reading after the initials . <p> " What 's this about ? " <p> " Would you come with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock , guys , what 's this about ? " <p> No answer . <p> " Are you aware that I 'm scheduled to start at Quantico in three weeks ? " <p> No answer . <p> " You want me to follow you in my car ? " Not that I wanted to try and give these fellows the slip , but my cell was in the glove box of the SUV and it would be nice to check in with the lieutenant on this one . It had a weird feel to it . Not exactly threatening , just weird . <p> " No , sir , we 'll bring you back here after . " <p> " After what ? " <p> No answer . <p> I looked at him and then the guy next to him . I could feel the cover-man behind me . They were big , they were nicely set  --  even with peripheral vision I could see that Bucket-head had his weight on the balls of his feet and evenly balanced . The other front-man was shifted to his right . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxing rather than martial arts ; boxers wear gloves . <p> They were doing almost everything right except that they were a little too close to me . You should never get that close . <p> But they looked like the real deal . It 's hard to fake the FBI look . <p> " Okay , " I said . <p> <p> CHAPTER THREE <p> Ocean City , Maryland / Saturday , June 27 ; 10:31 am <p> <p> Bucket-head sat beside me in the back and the other two sat up front , the cover-man driving the big government Crown Vic . For all the conversation going on the others might have been mimes . The air conditioner was turned up and the radio was turned off . Exciting . <p> " I hope we 're not going all the way the hell back to Baltimore . " That was more than a three-hour ride and I had sand in my shorts . <p> " No . " That was the only word Bucket-head said on the ride . I settled back to wait . <p> I could tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rig made . He kept me on his right side , which meant that his coat flap would impede me grabbing his piece and he could use his right hand as a block to fend me off while he drew . It was professional and well thought out . I 'd have done almost the same thing . What I would n't have done , though , was hold onto the leather handstrap by the door like he was doing . It was the second small mistake he made and I had to wonder if he was testing me or whether there was a little gap between his training and his instincts . <p> I settled back and tried to understand this pick-up . If this had something to do with the action last week on the docks , if I was somehow in trouble for something related to that , then I sure as hell planned to lawyer up when we got wherever we were going . And I wanted a union rep there , too . No way this was SOP . Unless it was some Homeland thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congressman . That warehouse thing was righteous and I was n't going to let anyone say different . <p> For the last eighteen months I 'd been attached to one of those interjurisdictional taskforces that have popped up everywhere post 9/11 . A few of us from Baltimore PD , some Philly and DC guys , and a mixed bag of Feds : FBI , NSA , ATF , and a few letter combinations I had n't seen before . Nobody really doing much but everyone wanting a finger in the pie in case something juicy happened , and by juicy I mean career beneficial . <p> I kind of got drafted into it . Ever since I 'd gotten my gold shield a few years ago I 'd been lucky enough to close a higher-than-average number of cases , including two that had loose ties to suspected terrorist organizations . I also had four years in the Army and I know a little bit of Arabic and some Farsi . I know a little bit of a lot of languages . Languages were easy for me , and that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of the people we wiretapped jumped back and forth between English and a variety of Middle Eastern languages . <p> The Taskforce seemed like it would be pretty cool but the reality of it was that they put me on wiretap in a van and for most of the last year and a half I drank too much Dunkin Donuts coffee and felt my ass grow flat . <p> Supposedly a group of suspected low-level terrorists with tenuous links to fundamentalist Shias were planning on smuggling something in that we were told was a potential bio-weapon . No details provided , of course , which makes surveillance a bitch and largely a waste of time . When we ( meaning us cops ) tried to ask them ( meaning the big shots from Homeland ) what we were looking for , we were stonewalled . Need to know basis . That sort of thing tells you everything about why we 're not all that safe . Truth is that if they tell us then we might play too significant a role in the arrest , which means they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 9/11 , and as far as I can tell it really has n't gotten much better since . <p> Then this past Monday I caught a little back and forth from a cell phone we were spooking . One name popped up -- a Yemen national named El Mujahid , who was a pretty big fish in the terrorist pond and was on Homeland 's must have list -- and the guy talking about him spoke as if El Mujahid was somehow involved in whatever the crew in the warehouse were cooking . El Mujahid 's name was on all of the DHS lists and in that van I had nothing to do but read , so I 'd read those lists over and over . <p> Because I rang the bell I got to play when the takedown was scheduled for Tuesday morning . Thirty of us in black BDUs with Kevlar body and limb pads , helmet-cams and full SWAT kit . The whole unit was split into four-man teams : two guys with MP5s , a pointman with a ballistic shield and a Glock .40 , and one guy with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my team and we hit this portside warehouse hard and fast , coming in every door and window in the place . Flashbangs , snipers on the surrounding buildings , multiple entry-points , and a whole lot of yelling . Domestic shock and awe , and the idea is to startle and over-power so that everyone inside would be too dazed and confused to offer violent resistance . Last thing anyone wanted was an O. K. Corral . <p> My team had the back door , the one that led out to a small boat dock . There was a tidy little Cigarette boat there . Not new , but sweet . While we waited for the go/no-go , the guy next to me  --  my buddy Jerry Spencer from DCPD- kept looking at the boat . I bent close and hummed the Miami Vice theme and he grinned . He was about to retire and that boat probably looked like a ticket to paradise . <p> The ' go ' came down and everything suddenly got loud and fast . We blew the steel deadbolt on the back door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay down their weapons . I 've been on maybe fifteen , eighteen of these things in my time with Baltimore PD and only twice was anyone stupid enough to draw a gun on us . Cops do n't hotdog it and generally neither do the bad guys . It 's not about who has the biggest balls , it 's about overwhelming force so that no shots are ever fired . I remember when I went through the tac-team training the commander had a quote from the movie Silverado made into a plaque and hung up in the training hall : " I do n't want to kill you and you do n't want to be dead . " I think Danny Glover said that . That 's pretty much the motto . <p> So , usually the bad guys stand around looking freaked out and everyone bleats about how innocent they are , yada yada . <p> This was n't one of those times . <p> Jerry , who was the oldest man on the Taskforce , was pointman and I was right behind him with two guys at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short corridor lined with framed inspection certificates , and then broke left into a big conference room . Big oak table with at least a dozen laptops on it . Just inside the door was a big blue phone booth-sized container standing against the wall . Eight guys in business suits seated around the table . <p> " Freeze ! " I yelled . " Put your hands above your heads and -- - " <p> That was as far as I got because all eight guys suddenly threw themselves out of their chairs and pulled guns . O.K. Corral , no doubt about it . <p> When IAD asked me to recollect how many shots I fired and who exactly I fired them at , I laughed . Twelve guys in a room and everyone 's shooting . If they 're not dressed like your buddies -- and you can , to a reasonable degree of certainty determine that they 're not civilian bystanders  --  you shoot and duck for cover . I fired the Remington dry then dropped it so I could pull my Glock . I know the .40 is standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuasive . <p> They say I dropped four hostiles . I do n't notch my gun , so I 'll take their word for it . I bring it up , though , because one of them was the thirteenth man in the room . <p> Yeah , I know I said that there were eight of them and four of us , but during the firefight I caught movement to my right and saw the door to the big blue case hanging loose , its lock ripped up by gunfire . The door swung open and a man staggered out . He was n't armed so I did n't fire on him ; instead I concentrated on the guy behind him who was tearing up the room with a QBZ-95 Chinese Assault Rifle , something I 'd only ever seen in magazines . Why he had it and where the hell he found ammunition for it I never did find out , but those rounds punched a line of holes right through Jerry 's shield and he went down . <p> " Son of a bitch ! " I yelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then this other guy , the thirteenth guy , comes crashing right into me . Even with all that was going on I thought ' Drug addict . ' He was pale and sweaty , stank like raw sewage and had a glazed bug-eyed stare . Sick bastard even tried to bite me , but the Kevlar pads on my sleeve saved my gun arm . <p> " Get off ! " I screamed and gave him an overhand left that should have dropped him , but all it did was shake him loose ; he blundered past me toward one of the other guys on my team who was blocking the door . I figured he was making for that sweet Cigarette outside , so I pivoted and parked two in his back , quick and easy . Blood sprayed the walls and he hit the deck and skidded five feet before coming to rest in a motionless sprawl against the back door . I spun back into the room and laid down cover fire so I could pull Jerry behind the table . He was still breathing . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with automatic fire . <p> I heard gunfire coming from a different part of the warehouse and peeled off from the pack to see what was happening , found a trio of hostiles in a nice shooting-blind laying down a lot of fire at one of the other teams . I popped a few of them with the last couple of rounds in my mag and dealt with the third hand-to-hand and suddenly the whole thing was over . <p> In the end , eleven alleged terrorists were shot , six fatally including the cowboy with the Chinese assault rifle guy and the biter I nailed in the back  --  who , according to his ID was named Javad Mustapha . We 'd just started going through ID 's when a bunch of Federal types in unmarked black fatigues came in and stole the show , kicking everyone else out onto the street . That was okay with me . I wanted to check on Jerry . Turned out that none of our team was killed , though eight of them needed treatment , mostly for broken ribs . Kevlar stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry had a cracked sternum and was one hurting pup . The EMTs had him on a gurney , but he was awake enough to wave me over before they took him away . <p> " How you feeling , dude ? " I asked , squatting next to him . <p> " Old and sore . But tell you whatsteal me that Cigarette boat and I 'll be feeling young and spry . " <p> " Sounds like a plan . I 'll get right on that , pops . " <p> He ticked his chin toward my arm . " Hey , how 's your arm ? The EMT said that fruitcake bit you . " <p> " Nah , did n't even break the skin . " I showed him . Just a bad bruise . <p> They took Jerry away and I started answering questions , some of them for the Feds in the unmarked BDUs . Javad had n't been armed and I 'd drilled him in the back so there would be a routine investigation , but my lieutenant told me it was a no-brainer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So why was I in a car with three Feds ? <p> They were n't talking . <p> So , I sat back and waited . <p> <p> <p> <p> CHAPTER FOUR <p> Easton , Maryland / Saturday , June 27 ; 11:58 am <p> <p> They put me in a room that had a table , two chairs and a big picture window with a drawn curtain . An interrogation room , though the sign outside had read Baylor Records Storage . We were somewhere in Easton off Route 50 , more than seventy miles from where they 'd picked me up . Bucket-head told me to sit . <p> " Can I have a drink of water ? " <p> He ignored me and left , locking the door . <p> It was nearly two hours before anyone came in . I did n't kick up a fuss . I knew this routine . Park someone in an empty room and leave them to stew . Doubt and a guilty conscience can do a lot when you 're alone . I did n't have a guilty conscience and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so after I did a visual on the room I went into my own head and waited , reviewing the number of thong bikinis I 'd seen . I was pretty sure the count was twenty-two , and of those at least eighteen had a legal and moral right to wear a thong . It was a good day at the beach . <p> The guy who finally came in was big , very well dressed , maybe sixty but there was no trace of middle age soft about him . Not that he looked especially hard , not like a muscle freak or a career D.I . No , he just looked capable . You pay attention to guys like him . <p> He took a seat opposite me . He wore a dark blue suit , red tie , white shirt and tinted glasses that made it hard to read his eyes . Probably on purpose . He had short hair , big hands and no expression at all . <p> Bucket-head came in with a cork restaurant tray on which was a pitcher of water , two glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the cookies that weirded me out . You generally do n't get cookies in situations like this and it had to be some kind of mind trick . <p> When Bucket-head left , the guy in the suit said , " My name is Mr. Church . " <p> " Okay , " I said . <p> " You are Detective Joseph Edwin Ledger , Baltimore Police , age 32 , unmarried . " <p> " You trying to fix me up with your daughter ? " <p> " You served forty-five months with the army , honorably discharged . During your time in service you were involved in no significant military actions or operations . " <p> " Nothing was happening while I was in the service , at least not in my part of the world . " <p> " And yet your commanding officers and particularly your sergeant in basic wrote glowingly of you . Why is that ? " He was n't reading out of a folder . He had no papers with him at all . His shaded eyes were fixed on me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Maybe I suck-up nicely . " <p> " No , " he said , " you do n't . Have a cookie . " He nudged the plate my way . " There are also several notes in your file suggesting that you are a world class smartass . " <p> " Really ? You mean I made it through the Nationals ? " <p> " And you apparently think you 're hilarious . " <p> " You 're saying I 'm not ? " <p> " Jury 's still out on that . " He took a cookie  --  a vanilla wafer  --  and bit off an edge . " Your father is stepping down as police commissioner to make a run for mayor . " <p> " I sure hope we can count on your vote . " <p> " You brother is also Baltimore PD and is a detective two with homicide . He 's a year younger and he outranks you . He stayed home while you played soldier . " <p> " Why I am here , Mr. Church ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face . " <p> " We could have done that at the precinct on Monday . " <p> " No , we could n't . " <p> " You could have called me and asked me to meet you somewhere neutral . They have cookies at Starbucks , you know . " <p> " Too big and too soft . " He took another bite of the wafer . " Besides , here is more convenient . " <p> " For ... ? " <p> Instead of answering he said , " After your discharge you enrolled in the police academy , graduated third in your class . Not first ? " <p> " It was a big class . " <p> " It 's my understanding that you could have been first had you wanted to . " <br> I took a cookie -- Oreo for me -- and screwed off the top . <p> He said , " You spent several nights of the last few weeks before your finals helping three other officers prepare for the test . As a result two of them did better and you did n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate the top . I like it in layers . Cookie , cream , cookie . <p> " So what ? " <p> " Just noting it . You received early promotion to plainclothes and even earlier promotion to detective . Outstanding letters and commendations . " <p> " Yes , I 'm wonderful . Crowds cheer as I go by . " <p> " And there are more notes about your smart mouth . " <p> I grinned with Oreo gunk on my teeth . <p> " You 've been recruited by the FBI and are scheduled to start your training in twenty days . " <p> " Do you know my shoe size ? " <p> He finished his cookie and took another vanilla wafer . I 'm not sure I could trust a man who would bypass an Oreo in favor of vanilla wafers . It 's a fundamental character flaw , possibly a sign of true evil . <p> " Your superiors at Baltimore PD say they 're sorry to see you go , and the FBI has high hopes . " <p> " Again , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " To make a point .. " <p> " About ? " <p> Mr. Church considered me for a moment . " On what not to become . What 's your opinion of the agents you met today ? " <p> I shrugged . " A bit stiff , no sense of humor . But they braced me pretty well . Good approach , kept the heat down , good manners . " <p> " Could you have escaped ? " <p> " Not easily . They had guns , I did n't . " <p> " Could you have escaped ? " He asked it slower this time . <p> " Maybe . " <p> " Mr. Ledger ... " <p> " Okay , yes . I could have escaped had I wanted to . " <p> " How ? " <p> " I do n't know , it did n't come to that . " <p> He seemed satisfied with that answer . " The pick-up at the beach was intended as something of a window to the future . Agents Simchek , Andrews and McNeill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are the very best the Bureau has to offer . " <p> " So ... I 'm supposed to be impressed . If I did n't think the FBI was a good next step I would n't have taken your offer . " <p> " Not my offer , Mr. Ledger . I 'm not with the Bureau . " <p> " Let me guess ... the ' Company ' ? " <p> He showed his teeth . It might have been a smile . " Try again . " <p> " Homeland ? " <p> " Right league , wrong team . " <p> " No point in me guessing then . Is this one of those ' we 're so secret we do n't have a name ' things ? " <p> Church sighed . " We do have a name , but it 's functional and boring . " <p> " Can you tell me ? " <p> " What would you say if I said ' but then I 'd have to kill you ' ? " <p> " I 'd say drive me back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I added , " Look , I was army for four and Baltimore PD for eight , the last eighteen months of which I 've been a gopher for the CT Taskforce . I know that there are levels upon levels of need-to-know . Well , guess what , Sparky : I do n't need to know . If you have a point then get to it , otherwise kiss my ass . " <p> " DMS , " he said . <p> I waited . <p> " Department of Military Sciences . " <p> I swallowed the last of my cookie . " Never heard of it . " <p> " Of course not . " Matter of fact , no mockery . <p> " So ... is this going to turn out to be some kind of cornball Men in Black thing ? Thin ties , black suits , and a little flashy thing that 'll make me forget all this shit ? " <p> He almost smiled . " No MIB , nothing retroengineered from crashed UFOs , no rayguns . The name , as I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A bunch of science geeks playing in the same league as Homeland ? " <p> " More or less . " <p> " No aliens ? " <p> " No aliens . " <p> " I 'm no longer in the military , Mr. Church . " <p> " Mm-hm . " <p> " And I 'm not a scientist . " <p> " I know . " <p> " So why am I here ? " <p> Church looked at me for almost a minute . " For someone who is supposed to have rage issues you do n't anger very easily , Mr. Ledger . Most people would be yelling by this point in an interview of this kind . " <p> " Would yelling get me back to the beach any sooner ? " <p> " It might . You also have n't asked for us to call your father . You have n't threatened me with his juice as commissioner . " <p> I ate another cookie . He watched me dismantle it and go through the entire time-honored Oreo ritual . When I was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Mr. Ledger , the reason I wanted you to meet the other agents today was because I need to know if that 's what you want to be ? " <p> " Meaning ? " <p> " When you look inside your own head , when you look at your own future , do you see yourself in a humorless grind of following bank accounts and sorting through computer records in hopes of bagging one bad guy every four months ? " <p> " Pays better than the cops . " <p> " You could open up a karate school and make three times more money . " <p> " Jujutsu . " <p> He smiled as if somehow he 'd scored a point and I realized that he 'd tricked me into correcting him out of pride . Sneaky bastard . <p> " So , tell me honestly , is that the kind of agent you want to be ? " <p> " If this is leading up to some kind of alternative suggestion , stop jerking me off and get to it . " <p> " Fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The DMS is considering offering you a job . " <p> " Um ... hello ? Not military ? Not a scientist ? " <p> " Does n't matter . We have plenty of scientists . The military connection is merely for convenience . No , this would be something along the lines of what you do well . Investigation , apprehension and some field work like at the warehouse . " <p> " You 're a fed , so are we talking counterterrorism ? " <p> He sat back and folded his big hands in his lap . " Terrorism is an interesting word . Terror ... " He tasted the word . " Mr. Ledger we are very much in the business of stopping terror . There are threats against this country greater than anything that has so far made the papers . " <p> " ' So far ' . " <p> " We  --  and when I say we I embrace my colleagues in the more clandestine agencies  --  have stopped fifty times as many threats than you would believe , ranging from suitcase nukes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home team . " <p> " We 've also worked to refine our definition of terrorism . Religious fundamentalism and political idealism actually play a far less important role , in a big picture sense , than most people -- including heads of state , friendly and not  --  would have the general public believe . " He looked at me for a moment . " What would you say is the most significant underlying motive for all world strife  --  terrorism , war , intolerance ... the works ? " <p> I shrugged . " Ask any cop and he 'll tell you that , " I said . " In the end it 's always about the money . " <p> He said nothing but I could sense a shift in his attitude toward me . There was the faintest whisper of a smile on his mouth . <p> I said , " All of this seems to be a long way from Baltimore . Why 'd you bring me here ? What 's so special about me ? " <p> " Oh , do n't flatter yourself , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " So , where are those guys ? You let them go back to the beach ? " <p> " No , Mr. Ledger , not as such . They did n't pass the audition . " <p> " I 'm not sure I like how you phrased that . " <p> " It was n't meant to be a comforting comment . " <p> " And I suppose you want me to ' audition ' next ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " How does that play out ? Bunch of mind games and psych tests ? " <p> " No , we know enough about you from your current medical records and fifteen years of psych evaluations . We know that in the last couple of years you 've suffered severe losses . First your mother died of cancer and then your ex-girlfriend committed suicide . We know that when you and she were teenagers you were attacked , and that some older teens beat you nearly to death and then held you down and made you watch as they raped her . We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissociative phase as a result , and that you 've had some intermittent rage issues , which is one of the reasons you regularly see a therapist . It 's fair to say you understand and can recognize the face of horror when you see it . " <p> It would have felt pretty good to demonstrate the whole rage concept to him right then , but I guessed that 's what he would be looking for . Instead I made my face look bored . " This is where I should get offended that you 've invaded my privacy , et cetera ? " <p> " It 's a new world , Mr. Ledger . We do what we must . And , yes , I know how that sounds . " Nothing in his tone of voice sounded like an apology . <p> " So , what do I have to do ? " <p> " It 's quite simple , really . " He got up and walked around the table to the curtain that hung in front of the big picture window . With no attempt at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . One table , one chair , one occupant . A man sitting hunched forward , his back to the window , possibly asleep . " All you need to do is go in there , then cuff and restrain that prisoner . " <p> " You kidding me ? " <p> " Not in the least . Go in there , subdue the suspect , put him in cuffs , and attach the cuffs to the D-ring mounted on the table . " <p> " What 's the catch ? That 's one guy . Your goon squad could have --  . " <p> " I am aware what overwhelming force could do , Mr. Ledger . That 's not the point of this exercise . " He reached into his jacket pocket and produced a pair of handcuffs . " I want you to do it . " <p> <br> Continues ...
