<p> On Thursday the 36-year-old Asian Art Museum of San Francisco will complete an institutional rite of passage : opening its own building to the public . <p> The building  --  the old Main Library in Civic Center  --  has been deftly restructured inside by Italian architect Gae Aulenti , famous for having transformed the 1900 Gare d'Orsay train station in Paris into the tremendously popular Musee d'Orsay . <p> The overall cost will be $160.5 million , of which $157 million , including $52 million in city money , has been raised to date . <p> " It appears they successfully converted the old Main Library into a functioning and beautiful art museum , which is a huge accomplishment , " said Harry Parker , director of San Francisco 's Fine Arts Museums , which includes the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum . " It certainly gives the Asian Art Museum the kind of prestige and stature to which it has aspired . " <p> The AAMSF also adds a new name to its old one  --  the Chong-Moon Lee Center for Asian Art and Culture  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unparalleled $15 million to the museum 's capital campaign in 1999 . <p> Like the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in its many years as a tenant of the Veterans Memorial Building , the Asian Art Museum , from its founding , saw its prestige dimmed by having to occupy an architectural appendage to the de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park . <p> " There was one major entrance , and it was through the de Young tower , " said Asian museum director Emily Sano . " Everybody identified that building , as they had for 100 years , with the de Young . People walking in did n't realize that the left wing was a separate museum . It meant that we did n't have much of an identity . People thought , ' Here 's the de Young 's Asian collection , ' if they thought about it at all . " <p> No one will make such a mistake in the future . <p> The old de Young has been demolished to make way for construction of a new building on the same Golden Gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cost $185 million . <p> Both it and the Asian aspire to the " destination " status SFMOMA achieved the moment it opened its signature downtown building . <p> With 163,000 square feet , the Asian 's new facility more than doubles the size of its previous home . <p> " We will never again have to take down portions of the collection just to host a traveling show , " a severe shortcoming of the old facility , Sano said . The new museum 's vastly expanded space " allows us to show the collections in a comprehensive manner . We are able to show the full spectrum now  --  all the way from the Philippines to Iran and Turkey , from Mongolia down through the Indonesian islands . We will be able to show parts of the collection that were rarely seen before . And the public will be quite surprised by the depth and variety of the collection across the board . " <p> The new Asian will be able to display about 2,500 objects from its own collection at all times , twice as many as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floated the idea of relocating the Asian from Golden Gate Park to Civic Center . As part of the Civic Center historic district , the 1917 building had to be preserved when a new library was built nearby . <p> Former Asian museum director Rand Castile , Sano 's predecessor , persuaded the Asian Art Commission  --  the municipal museum 's board  --  to commit to the plan . In November 1994 , shortly before Castile 's retirement , voters approved a $42 million bond issue for seismic upgrade of the old Main Library as part of its conversion to museum use . <p> The idea of moving the Asian out of Golden Gate Park met some popular resistance . The de Young 's future location was still under discussion at the time , and some argued that to remain near the park 's Japanese Tea Garden , the Asian should expand its existing site if the de Young were to decamp . <p> Others objected that the Beaux Arts architectural style of the old Main Library building was inappropriate to a museum of Asian art , even though some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many locals simply preferred the landscaped beauty of the park to the seedy Civic Center area . <p> The Asian hit a rough patch in conversion of the old Main Library when it insisted on removing 14 fresco murals installed there in the 1930s by San Francisco tonalist painter Gottardo Piazzoni ( 1872-1945 ) . <p> Art historians and conservators argued that the Piazzonis ' removal would mean their destruction , through irreparable damage , ultimate neglect or both . <p> The Asian finally resolved the dispute by agreeing to pay for the murals ' conservation , storage and relocation . Ten of them will be installed in the new de Young Museum , whose American art collection will provide an appropriate context for them . <p> Beyond the advantages of a downtown location , the Asian 's move promised the opportunity to redesign its public face  --  architecturally , in the presentation of its holdings and in its overall programming . <p> In view of the Bay Area 's large , diverse Asian population , " it was almost a necessity for the ( Asian Art ) museum to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Desai , director of the Asia Society Museum in New York . " The very fact that the building is fairly good sized and is a public landmark should signal the importance of these communities . But we should n't think that if you just build a building and put the collection out that they will come . You have to develop strategic linkages with the communities to make them feel comfortable . I think the Asian has understood this . " <p> For visitors of a certain age , the long-standing confusion about the Asian Art Museum 's identity may have begun reasonably enough with the 1960 exhibition at the de Young of 137 Asian artworks from the @break collection of Chicago industrialist and Olympic czar Avery Brundage . <p> The show preceded a June election with a bond issue on the ballot to meet Brundage 's condition for donating his collection to the city : construction of a dedicated museum wing . <p> In 1964 , construction of the Asian wing of the de Young , as it was originally known , began . It was christened the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1969 , Brundage donated the remainder of his art holdings , and the city formed the Asian Art Commission to oversee the new institution . <p> Brundage had not collected with a museum in mind . So despite the strong foundation his gift provided , the work of directors and curators since then has been to expand and balance the museum 's overall collection , to make it truly panoramic across time and cultures . <p> In the early ' 90s , the AAMSF became the first American museum to establish curatorial departments of Southeast Asian and Korean art . It is still the only such institution with a full-time curator of Korean art . The galleries devoted to Korean art in the new Asian will make the importance of that distinction clear to everyone . <p> The new Asian 's first big special exhibition , scheduled for the fall , a survey of the roots of Korean art , will feature unprecedented loans from museums in Asia and North America . <p> Just as world events cast a shadow on the Asian when it closed in Golden Gate Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tensions with North Korea threaten to jeopardize the Asian 's planned Korean art exhibition . <p> " Of course , it 's daunting to open a brand-new facility in the current unfavorable economic environment , " Sano said . " But over the last 10 years , we developed a reserve fund of more than $4 million to ensure our operation through the transitional years , before we can start bringing in earned income from admission fees and shop sales . " <p> If annual attendance sustains the projected level of 400,000 , the new Asian Art Museum 's stability may be secure . But nothing can shelter it from the shocks of increasingly perilous international relations . <p> OPENING WEEK ACTIVITIES <p> Today : Members ' open house , 10 a.m. -5 p.m . <p> Monday : No events <p> Tuesday : New Asian donor receptions , 5-10 p.m . <p> Wednesday : New Asian donor gala dinner , 6 p.m. - midnight <p> Thursday : Dedication and ribbon-cutting ceremony , 10-11 a.m. ; museum opens to the public , 11 a.m. -9 p.m. ( admission free ) ; fireworks display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenneth Baker at **28;10072;TOOLONG and Jesse Hamlin at jhamlin@sfchronicle.com.
