<p> The chairman of Booz Allen Hamilton said yesterday that no decision had been made on whether his company will continue to sponsor Washington 's annual PGA Tour event beyond this year . <p> The McLean-based company is committed by contract to sponsor the event through this year 's tournament at TPC at Avenel in Potomac . The PGA Tour announced last week that the Washington event would move from its regular June slot on the golf calendar to October starting next year . <p> " I will reserve final judgment on remaining the title sponsor until I speak with PGA Commissioner Tim Finchem , " Ralph Shrader , chairman and chief executive of Booz Allen Hamilton , said in an interview . " But I do have some major concerns . When we took this project on , my commitment was to bring a world-class event to Washington . . . . When I look at the challenge of staging an event in this area in the fall , I 'm mindful it may not be the best time of year for Washington and for the fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been able to raise in the past . " <p> The 2007 Tour schedule , released last Friday , included a number of major changes , not the least of which was pushing Washington 's event , staged here in May or June since 1980 , into October . Starting with next year 's event , the tournament would be part of a new fall series staged after the $10 million Tour Championship in September . <p> The tour has said the events after the Tour Championship will provide more opportunities for players at the lower end of the money list to secure playing privileges for the following season . They 'll be contested at a time of the year when many of the game 's top players are entering fewer events or playing in events overseas . <p> In an interview yesterday , Finchem said the tour will announce within the next 60 days more details about the fall series , including the possibility that it include a lucrative financial bonus system as a lure to attract the game 's top names . He said he believes the fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of qualifying for major championships , invitational events and World Golf Championship tournaments that use money earnings and world rankings to determine their fields . <p> " It 's not that these fall tournaments wo n't be important to the players , " Finchem said . " It 's true we do think they 'll play a little more between January and September . But the overall play should not deviate too much from the way it is now . They all play in the fall now . It 's just a question of where . They have to play because they ca n't get too rusty . The fall series will be worth more than just a guy keeping his card . " <p> Finchem offered few specifics on why Washington lost its usual late spring place on the calendar , but interviews with other PGA Tour and Booz Allen Classic officials provided several possibilities . <p> Shrader has been highly critical of the course and clubhouse at Avenel , the venue for the event since the facility , which is owned by the PGA Tour , opened in 1987 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invest a substantial amount of time and money to upgrade the course and clubhouse . <p> But several sources indicated the tour may not be willing to spend the money  --  perhaps as much as $25 million  --  necessary to make Avenel an attractive , player-friendly facility , or to close down the profitable club for the amount of time  --  at least a full year  --  needed to make those changes . Moving the event to the fall , those sources said , might be one way to justify less extensive and less costly cosmetic changes , since the top players might not show up anyway . <p> The move of the Players Championship from March to May also had an impact on the 2007 schedule . It would be difficult to play an event in the area much earlier than May 1 because the course would need time to recover from the winter . Other events in May , with far better venues and usually much better fields , also were more attractive to the tour and its network TV partners . <p> Shrader had said in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two before the U.S. Open , and not the week after . Last year , the Booz Allen Classic was played at Congressional the week before the Open and attracted huge crowds and one of the best fields in its history . <p> But starting in 2007 , the slot two weeks before the Open will go to Jack Nicklaus 's Memorial Tournament in Dublin , Ohio . As one tour official said , " Whatever Jack wants , Jack usually gets . " In 2007 , the St. Jude Classic in Memphis , sponsored by Memphis-based FedEx , will have the coveted slot the week before the Open . FedEx also is the title sponsor for the tour 's new FedEx Cup competition , a three-week stretch of qualifying events after the PGA Championship leading up to the $10 million Tour Championship . <p> Several sources said part of that lucrative sponsorship agreement with FedEx included a quid pro quo that the Memphis tournament would also have a prime spot on the 2007 schedule . The week before the Open , most players like to hone their games leading up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong field . <p> The slot the week after the Open will be taken up by the 84 Lumber event in Pennsylvania , which has always been played in the fall . Joe Hardy , the owner of 84 Lumber , has cultivated strong relationships with a number of top tour players , most notably Vijay Singh and John Daly , and with both men in the field , the tournament has strong spectator and television appeal . <p> Still , Shrader said yesterday he had no inkling that the tour was even contemplating such a radical change involving the Washington tour stop until Finchem called him on Friday , just before announcing the new schedule . He said it was never mentioned as a possibility in his most recent discussions with Finchem and other tour officials at the Presidents Cup in September . <p> Shrader also said he has a number of serious reservations about staging a meaningful tournament in the fall , after completion of all the major championships and the Tour Championship . <p> " The Redskins dominate the sports scene here in the fall , and college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Golf courses in this area tend to take a beating over the summer . Last fall , all the courses were suffering some degree of stress . The issue also becomes , can you stage a world-class event when you 're going to have a hard time attracting a world-class field ? <p> " Having said all of that , Tim said when I spoke to him Friday that he 'd like to say that we 'll continue discussions about remaining the sponsor . I told him I would certainly hear him out , and I 'm committed to hearing them out . We have n't determined when that will be . " <p> Finchem said he hopes to meet with Shrader within the next 30 to 45 days . " Our intent is to continue with them , " Finchem said . " We like the continuity and we like the brand . They 're good people . But if it does n't work out , we 're also very positive about other options . " <p> As for conflicts in drawing fans to the golf course during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Texas and Florida  --  " two of the most passionate football states in the country "  --  had been highly successful in raising money for charity in recent years . He also indicated the tour would try to work with the NFL in staging the tournament on a weekend the Redskins were either playing on the road or on a bye week . <p> " The discussion in Washington has always been around what do you have to do to have a first-rate tournament ? " Finchem said . " It 's a struggle that 's been going on for 20 years . <p> " It has to do with the golf course , which can be improved . It has to do with the infrastructure for the fans , which also has to be improved , and with the date structure . <p> " We 've bounced tournaments around in the past to make everyone happy . But when you do that , you find the quality is inconsistent , the field is inconsistent , the title sponsor becomes . . . unhappy , which results in sponsor turnover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide a significant level of consistency of dates and not jump around . We had to make some tough calls . We 've got a lot of work to do , and we recognize that . It will be a challenge , but I think we can get there . "
