<p> For nearly 20 years , Hawaii 's Gold Coast  --  the sunny resort strip carved out of lava and lapped by snorkel-ready waters on the Big Island 's west side  --  had a curious tarnish at its southern end . <p> North of busy Kailua-Kona , the tourist anchor of the west side , the black fields of the Kohala Coast bloomed with ever-pricier hotels , private golf courses and luxury second-home and condo communities . But just 8 miles south of Kona ( as most visitors call the port town ) , the once-vibrant , less exorbitantly priced Keauhou Resort , centered around the Kona Country Club golf course and sheltered Keauhou Bay , was quietly going to seed . <p> Of the three hotels on the 2,200-plus-acre resort , the Kona Lagoon had closed in 1988 and soon became a spooky ruin ; the Kona Surf , a hot spot in the 1970s , should have closed much earlier , but stayed open in increasingly shabby conditions until 2000 ; and the Keauhou Beach Resort , formerly the site of King Kalakaua 's summer home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not only tourist facilities were in disrepair : Hawaiian cultural sites such as heiau ( temples ) , an important burial ground and royal landmarks also showed signs of severe neglect . Even the resort 's signature sea creature , the manta ray , started to drift toward the more welcoming north once the lights went out at the Kona Surf . <p> Whatever the reasons for the resort 's falling fortunes  --  the Japanese economic bust , the " upscaling " of travel , local disputes  --  they no longer matter . Keauhou ( say " Kay-oh-hoh " and you 'll be close ) , which means " new beginnings " or " new era " in Hawaiian , is finally living up to its name . <p> From virtually brand-new or upgraded hotels to restored historic sites showcasing its royal legacy and ancient heritage , it 's easy to take a shine again to this part of the Gold Coast . Here you 're close to both the nightlife of Kona and the marine life of Kealakekua Bay  --  not to mention the night marine life of Keauhou Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  <p> including new cultural programs  --  is still in progress , now is a great time to check out Keauhou before it 's rediscovered and hotel room rates  --  not to mention more condos , time shares and homes  --  go up . <p> Royal real estate <p> Polynesian voyagers are thought to have reached this part of the Big Island nearly a thousand years before the current landowners , Kamehameha Schools ( KS ) , opened the resort in 1965 . As on all the Hawaiian islands , the early settlers divided the land into ahupua'a , pie-shaped wedges sloping from mountain to sea that gave each community access to forests , fields and sea . Inherited from Princess Bernice Puahi Bishop , the KS lands that became the Keauhou resort included the ahupua'a of Kahalu'u and Keauhou . <p> Kahalu'u , today the site of the landmark tiny , blue St. Peter 's Church and the district 's popular beach park , was where most commoners in the area lived . Their handiwork can be seen in the remnants of an old stone fishing wall that nearly closes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea , and in the several heiau still standing . But these workers and priests occasionally had royalty in their midst : King David Kalakaua , the " Merry Monarch " and penultimate sovereign of Hawaii ( 1836-1891 ) , summered here . <p> A re-creation of his plantation-style cottage ( the original burned down years ago ) stands amid palms and a small pond he would have used as his private bath on what is now the grounds of the Outrigger Keauhou Beach Resort hotel . Although the cottage is not open to the public , you can walk up to the porch and peek through the windows ; in the front bedroom a beautiful Hawaiian quilt covers the simple bed . <p> Above the bed hangs a solemn portrait of the king whose life was not always so merry ( his extravagant spending was not well received by the Westerners itching to take control of the islands ) . But Kalakaua was beloved by his people , then and now , especially for restoring hula to them . One of the Hawaiian men selling traditional crafts and leis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what I called the king 's summer cottage was actually just his sleeping quarters  --  the monarch would have had a number of buildings for different purposes sprinkled across the site , and of course the whole leafy outdoors as his living room . <p> As for the 309-room hotel , it has seen a substantial upgrade in furnishings and dining services in the past year , explaining its rebranding from the budget Ohana line to the more upscale Outrigger name in March . While the small pool , which looks toward Kona under a stand of tall palms , is not much bigger than the king 's quarters , the improvements are continuing and the oceanfront setting of its updated restaurants and bar , which jut out over the reef , are striking . ( If you do n't see a turtle somewhere , you 're not looking closely enough . ) <p> Playing on the bay <p> While the commoners toiled and worshiped in Kahalu'u , the ali'i ( royalty ) played in Keauhou  --  and they played hard . Long before the X Games , they raced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slide , a Hawaiian form of luge that 's being rediscovered on the islands . The early Hawaiians would use narrow wooden sleds to shoot down the 50-foot-wide , slippery stone-lined track all the way from the volcanic slopes above the modern thoroughfare of Ali'i Drive down to He'eia Bay . Today , homes surround the pocket bay lined with smooth black stones , and the Kona Country Club golf course and clubhouse block the lower half of the royal slide . Even so , what remains is the longest holua course discovered so far , visible from Ali'i Drive and accessible by foot across from the clubhouse entrance . <p> It 's said the ali'i also kept the harbor of Keauhou Bay , the next inlet south , all to themselves . With low caves providing shelter on the shore and a freshwater spring at the water 's edge , the cove was well-suited to be the birthplace of King Kamehameha III ( 1814-54 ) . A " blue baby , " the young prince was revived by the spring water , and lived to become the longest-reigning king of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a plaque and a pleasant walkway through a small , labeled garden of native plants . The dock by the spring that saved him is a busy place . By day , locals try their hand at fishing while snorkelers and divers set off for Kealekekua Bay in kayaks or on a Fair Wind catamaran . We enjoyed an expedition on the latter , which features a water slide , diving platform , breakfast and lunch buffets , and a digital videographer with an infectious enthusiasm for his underwater subjects . <p> After sunset several nights a week , fans of manta rays board a boat for a trip of just a few hundred yards , to an illuminated spot across from the extreme makeover of the Kona Surf , now the Sheraton Keauhou Bay Resort and Spa . There snorkelers can hover above the massive marine acrobats , while divers watch the mantas somersault from the ocean floor ( see sidebar ) . <p> Culture clash <p> While the historic marker at Keauhou Bay notes the beginning of one life , a short drive away is another commemorating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terraced field of lava stones , is the final resting place of about 300 warriors in the 1819 Battle of Kuamo'o , named for the adjacent bay . In the battle , Christian converts backed by the monarchy defeated Hawaiian traditionalists who wanted to retain the kapu belief system , which had divided men and women , royalty and commoners , but had also helped preserve natural resources . ( Ironically , Lekeleke is next to the site of a modern Hawaiian battleground  --  the proposed Hokuli'a luxury homes development , which has pitted pro-agriculture and native Hawaiian forces against developers and property owners in a protracted legal dispute . ) <p> Adding disgrace to the traditionalists ' defeat , Lekeleke over the years had become a shambles of overturned rocks and exposed bones . But Kamehameha Schools has restored the burial ground and erected a plaque explaining the significance of the mournful site , now flecked with wild grass and occasionally ti-leaf-wrapped stones left to honor the dead . <p> A similar plaque now marks the ' Ohi'a Caves , where some other Hawaiians were buried and some hid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the heiau along the coast . Perhaps even more important is the plan to reconnect Keauhou  --  residents and visitors alike  --  with its Hawaiian heritage through education . <p> The first priority , according to the resort manager I spoke with , is creating a community learning center that will work with hotels and community groups to offer unique cultural outreach programs . " We do n't have white sandy beaches , but we do have culture , and we have marine resources , " he said . <p> Envisioned to open in the next two years , the center is expected to l benefit from the separate development of an academy with a formal curriculum of traditional Hawaiian disciplines . The academy , scheduled to start courses in five years , would eventually become like Frank Lloyd Wright 's Taliesin , where students could learn hula , woodworking and healing arts , for example , while the public enjoyed lectures , workshops , recitals and art shows . <p> Water world <p> The most amazing transformation to date , however , has to belong to the 521-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ago and an official grand opening in April . <p> To keep its dazzlingly close perch to the ocean under current zoning laws , the Sheraton 's owners could not completely demolish the old Kona Surf . But the architectural bones that remain look like nothing so much as the gills of a manta ray , allowing you to take in ocean views from nearly every turn . <p> The manta ray motif is everywhere  --  in the window lattices at Kai restaurant , the bustling breakfast spot that also offers haute-Hawaiian cuisine for dinner ; in the name of Cafe Hahalua ( " manta ray " ) , which serves espresso and deli fare ; and on the in-room TV , which shows manta-ray footage from the dives just offshore . We could n't miss the chance to float with the rays , but I also treasured seeing a large manta surface one night while I stayed dry on the Sheraton 's special viewing terrace . <p> Much like a manta ray , the center of the hotel is now water , too . Where the old Kona Surf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a sprawling pool and waterfall , which sinuously connects to an even larger oceanfront pool . Rivaled on the Big Island only by the Hilton Waikoloa , the aquatic complex features a 200-foot-long , lava-tube-inspired water slide ( the longest in the state ) . It also has a children 's area that includes a sandy-floored shallow " beach , " a fountain playground and a Jacuzzi , where several parents happily soaked as they kept an eye on their frolicking kids . " We 've spent the last three days here , and it 's been great , " one New York mom told me . <p> The old Kona Surf pool , subject to saltwater infusions from winter storms , is now the site of the manta viewing area and the Crystal Blue lounge , where shimmering blue lights recall its aquatic origin . That 's where you go for the nightly mai tai reception  --  free if you purchase the " resort package , " a per-room charge that includes a lavish breakfast buffet and many other amenities . ( It 's an annoyance that the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with introductory rates as low as $169 a night , it 's still a good deal compared with the Kohala Coast . ) <p> Food for the soul <p> When they can pull themselves away from the pool , Sheraton guests can take a free shuttle bus to Kahalu'u Beach Park and the hilltop Keauhou Shopping Center , home to a modern seven-screen movie theater , weekly free entertainment and several well-regarded restaurants and cafes . <p> The sushi preparations at Kenichi Pacific , a Japanese fusion restaurant with outposts in Aspen and Austin , Texas , were so elegant we actually felt underdressed in our shorts and T-shirts ( although we were assured we were n't ) . The Royal Thai Cafe offered an even cheaper but still tasty alternative to hotel fare , while Bay Area bohos would feel right at home at neighboring Peaberry &; Galette , an inexpensive , read-your-papers cafe with savory crepes . For real budget diners , there 's even a Wendy 's across the road , with an amazing ocean view and picnic tables under a shady trellis . <p> For a bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kona , where the shuttle also conveniently stops a couple times a day . The Sheraton guests I spoke to , however , were happy to have gone as only as far as the Kahalu'u Beach park , and I understood how they felt . At night , I enjoyed seeing the twinkling lights of Kona miles across the water from our hotel balcony , but in this new era for Keauhou , that 's as close as I needed to get to feel like royalty . <p> IF YOU GO <p> All locations are in the Keauhou Resort on the Big Island , although street addresses use Kailua-Kona . . <p> Getting there <p> From San Francisco , United Airlines flies nonstop to Keahole Kona International Airport , a 14 1/2-mile drive to Keauhou .
