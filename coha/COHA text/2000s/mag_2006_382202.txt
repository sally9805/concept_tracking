The JCPenny at Queens Center mall in Elmhurst , N.Y. , is decked out for the holidays . Nothing surprising there . But visit the second floor , and you 'll find something quite unexpected sandwiched between women 's coats and fine jewelry : a 3,100-sq. - ft . Sephora , the European retailer known for its hip beauty products . The boutique is a miniversion of a typical Sephora store , replete with fanciful makeup and pricey skin-care lines presented on accessible , self-service shelves . <P> The lighting and signage are exactly the same as in a Sephora store , as is the black-and-white color scheme . Step out of the space , though , and the techno-pop sound track gives way to the drone of holiday background music , and you 're back where you started  --  the second floor of a department store . <P> The new store within a store  --  one of five Sephoras opened in a Penney in October  --  is part of the new face of a century-old retailer and the $18.8 billion company 's strategy to attract younger , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will open , followed by nine more in June . " It 's a brilliant move , " says Citigroup analyst Deborah Weinswig . " It has a halo effect on the whole store . " <P> Across the Hudson River at the Newport Centre mall in Jersey City , N.J. , Kohl 's , the $13.4 billion chain based in Menomonee Falls , Wis. , is in the middle of its own makeover . The store , opened just in time for the prime shopping season , is the antithesis of the formula that has worked for Kohl 's since it was founded in 1962 . Unlike its hallmark one-floor , off-mall format , loved by suburban working moms , this two-story unit lies smack-dab in the center of  --  drumroll , please  --  a mall , directly across from none other than Macy 's . Even Kohl 's off-mall stores are changing , taking on a more department-store-like look . At a new Kohl 's in Brandon , Fla. , for example , big glass windows , slick white benches and piped-in music welcome shoppers . " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we sell and putting it in an exciting environment for them , " says Kevin Mansell , president of Kohl 's . " We want to broaden our reach . " <P> Penney and Kohl 's are n't just hanging holiday tinsel to get customers to fill up their Christmas stockings . By adding exclusive-to-them designer labels and partnering with upscale sellers , they are redeveloping the middle market , a segment once thought lost forever in the crush between the high and low end . " Both JCPenney and Kohl 's have come to understand what their shoppers expect : great prices every day , ease of shopping and an exciting store , " says Wendy Liebmann , founder of WSL Strategic Retail , a consultancy that publishes quarterly surveys on how Americans shop . " They 're working hard to address the needs of the core , Middle America shopper . " <P> Retailers are heading for a decent if not solid Christmas , but the industry is still sorting itself out after a series of big deals and big changes . Last year Federated , which owns Macy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Macy 's , having replaced with its own marquee some famous regional department-store names  --  Marshall Field 's , Famous-Barr , Kaufmann 's , Filene 's  --  experienced a strong 8.5% increase in same-store sales for November . Sears , which combined with Kmart in 2004 , is still struggling . And Wal-Mart , in the throes of a mammoth , disruptive restructuring , reported a dismal 0.1% drop in sales .
