SPORT Headnote So the British have banned the killing of foxes and other wild mammals with the aid of dogs . Now what ? A report from the sponge-wet moors of Barmy Britannia // A stag flanked by two female red deer , or " hinds , " trotted down a steep moorland pasture toward a wood . Two mounted hunters were behind them , and staghounds were in between . The deer 's trot was faster than the hunters ' canter and as fast as the all-out run of the hounds . A horn was blown . We were off-over a soaked , slippery sheep meadow , between the stone posts of a narrow gate , down a muddy track perilous with ruts , into a country lane barely an arm 's breadth wide , through the tiny streets of an old village with tourists hopping out of our way , and then making a hairpin turn onto a paved road , speeding uphill around blind curves , and narrowly avoiding several head-on collisions with trucks . It was a thrilling ride , even if it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stag hunting who had volunteered to show me the Devon and Somerset Staghounds hunt on Exmoor , in England 's West Country . We arrived at a hilltop opposite the steep pasture and above the woods . From there I could look across a valley at ... not much . On the crest of the far slope several dozen members of the hunt were sitting on their horses . They watched two dogs sniffing the underbrush below . Two men in scarlet coats were with the dogs , more closely watching them sniff . The idea of a stag hunt evokes chivalry-knights in jerkins and hose , ladies on sidesaddles with wimples and billowing dresses , a white stag symbolizing something-or-other , and Robin Hood getting in the way . An actual stag hunt is more like a horseback meeting of a county planning commission . The equestrian committee is responding to deer-population-growth issues and deer-herd rural sprawl . Red deer are noble animals-big , anyway . They are half again the size of American whitetails . In the fall a mature stag has antlers that could hang the hats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also pests . England is intensely cultivated . A farmer may find a hundred red deer in his pasture , each eating as much grass as three sheep . A chivalrous aspect to stag hunting remains , however . The three hunts in the Exmoor region maintain , with noblesse oblige , a twenty-four-hour emergency service for sick or injured deer . Mostly these are deer that have been hit by cars and have crawled off into the bushes - as many as a hundred of them a year . Members of the hunts will come out in the middle of the night to track these suffering creatures . In some years the hunters do as much euthanizing as they do hunting . Each stag hunt has a " harbourer , " a specialist whose job is to watch the herds and select a specific quarry , chosen for its lack of Darwinian promise . Only this one animal is to be hunted . For a proper hunt , or " meet , " in which Rovers and BMWs do not initiate the pursuit , the harbourer spends the previous day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the morning of the hunt he reports to the huntsman . The huntsman brings in older , experienced hounds , called " tufters , " to separate the stag from the herd . It was this singling-out that I was watching in the steep moorland pasture . Although it was n't working perfectly . As unpromising as that young stag may have been from the harbourer 's point of view , the two hinds thought he was worth running away with . Once the stag is solitary , the huntsman 's assistant , the " whipper-in , " is supposed to bring up the full pack , and the hunt 's members and guests fall in behind the hounds . Miles and miles of furious cross-country galloping ensues . Unless it does n't . As it seemed not to be doing from my vantage point across the valley . When the chase does happen , the usual outcome is that the stag , at last , turns and " stands at bay , " facing the hounds . Then ( rather disappointingly for those whose imaginations run to tenderhearted indignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stag to shreds . They bark . There 's probably not much else they could do with an irked and antlerwaving stag . Staghounds are not giant Scottish deerhounds or hulking , red-eyed mastiffs . They 're just foxhounds , happy and hound-doggy and friendly if you are n't prey . " You can set your baby down in the middle of a pack , " a hunter told me , " and they 'll lick him silly . " What happens to the stag is that the huntsman walks over to it and prosaically shoots it in the head with a special short-barreled , folding-stock shotgun . This is an illegal weapon in Great Britain . But on stag hunts it 's legally required . Speaking of Britain 's laws , killing wild mammals with the aid of dogs , as the Exmoor hunt was trying to do , is forbidden . Except when-as I understand the parliamentary Hunting Act of 2004-it is mandatory . The act contains certain conditions for " exempt hunting " that allow the killing of wild mammals with the aid of dogs-if " as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mammal is shot dead by a competent person . " No letting it go , even if it 's Bambi 's mother . Furthermore , only two dogs may be used at a time . And no letting the dogs kill the wild mammals , the way fox hunters always have done . The stain must be upon you , not your pet . The Hunting Act came into effect on February 18 , 2005 , a few weeks before this Exmoor meet . I got in touch with Adrian Dangar , the hunting correspondent for The Field , a British field-sports magazine . He said that I should n't write about fox hunting , which is the most notable activity banned under the act . It 's all that anybody is writing about . And it 's such a social occasion . He said that the stag hunters were a doughty and resolute lot , and stag hunting was more of a way of life . I went to Exmoor with Adrian . We stayed with the chairman of the stag hunt , Tom Yandle . He was doughty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries ' standing . I went to the meet expecting a scene of American seething , full of the half-suppressed violence that Americans thwarted in their beliefs or their hobbies half-suppress so well . What I found was a cheerful , natty crowd on horseback , booted and spurred and listening to a talk from the hunt secretary about strict adherence to the Hunting Act , especially in the matter of using just two dogs . The whole pack of staghounds was there , but they 'd been split into pairs , with each twosome in the back of a different vehicle . The hunt secretary gave her opinion that hunting the pairs serially was in accord with the letter and spirit of the law . Having just two dogs in the field was exactly the problem . So I was told by the retired grocer and other hunt followers gathered on the hilltop vantage point , watching the lack of action through binoculars . Two hounds were not enough to break the stag away from the hinds . Or two hounds were not enough to make the stag stand at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I was told was the music of a pack in full cry . The followers were local farmers and farm wives , mostly past middle age . Many had ridden with the hunt years before . The men wore tweed jackets and neckties . The women wore tweed skirts and twinsets . Everyone wore waxed cotton Barbour jackets . The hunt members were dressed in black and brown riding coats , buff whipcord breeches , and hunting bowlers . They wore elaborately tied and gold-pinned white stocks at their throats . All the clothes were seasoned and washed to a perfect Ralph Lauren degree . If hunting dies out , from where will Ralph draw outdoorsy English inspiration ? Will suburban Americans be wearing the undershirts , rolled trousers , and hankies-on-the-head of English sunbathers ? The hunt was moving . Horses were trotting over the far hill . The two hounds did their best in the music department . There was a spate of elderly , excited driving as hunt followers hurried to find a better view . We parked by a tributary of the River Exe . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of woods along the bank . The hounds were n't sure . The followers were n't sure . Possibly the stag came out of the woods . Possibly he did n't . The hunters went into the woods and came out . This sounds as interesting as cricket . And to the onlookers it was . The crowd had grown to forty or more and now included children in small tweeds and small Barbour jackets , and a man selling tea and sandwiches from a van . They all watched intently , the tea vendor included . There was a tense murmuring , as from a golf gallery . The staghounds and stag hunters trotted through a farmyard , and I followed on foot . Some local farmers are not hospitable to the traffic through their property-not hospitable , specifically , to the traffic of me . I was trying to take notes and make haste and avoid deep puddles and horse droppings , and I was n't wearing a necktie . " Is he all right ? " I heard a farmer ask . " He thought you were an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . " They come around bothering the hunts . " According to a brochure from the League Against Cruel Sports , " The League ... has collected an enormous amount of evidence of the cruelty of hunting . Years of undercover work and hunt monitoring has enabled members of parliament to see the real face of hunting . " Beyond the farm , on the Exmoor upland , the real face of hunting was soaking wet . The scenery was an alluring frustration : heather-covered , bosomy hills rising above dark nests of woods . A green girlfriend of a landscape . But somebody else 's girlfriend , greeting the hunt with cold drizzle and sharp wind . This buoyed everyone 's spirits . The British manner of cheerfully not complaining ca n't be maintained when there 's nothing to cheerfully not complain about . Forty horses ran across the moor . Stag hunting is not as show-offy as fox hunting . There 's no jumping of ditches , hedges , and gates . Exmoor is wet like a bath sponge ; no use ditching it for drainage . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone heaps piled up since Roman times . And the farmers leave the gates open because some things are more important than keeping sheep in . I witnessed none of the hat-losing , horse-flipping spectacles seen in engravings on the walls of steakhouses . And to be truthful , my entire knowledge of hunting on horseback has been gained by staring at such decor between courses . I had been offered a tame mount on which to follow the hunt . " How tame ? " I asked . " Very tame . " " There was a man who used to come through my neighborhood in the 1950s with a pony and a camera ... " " Not that tame . " Wind , rain , and temperature grew worse . The hunt descended into a precipitous dell where I 'd have thought the riders would have to walk their mounts . They did n't . But I could n't even walk . I returned to where the hunt followers were gathered by the side of a road . The followers were disturbed . A pale and agitated young couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antis . " They were dressed head-to-toe in black . They turned out to be lost backpackers who 'd made the mistake of going out into nature for fun . They were wet and miserable . The hunters were not , or did n't feel that they were . But the stag and every trace of it had vanished , and the hunters decided to " pack it in , to spare the horses . " Tom , Adrian , and I headed back to Tom 's farm in his horse van , a bit disappointed . And then through the van windows came that music I 'd been told about : the full cry of a pack . It is a bouillabaisse of a noise , with something in it of happy kids on a playground , honking geese headed for your decoys , and the wheeee of a deep-sea fishing reel when you 've hooked something huge . This particular music was being sung in soprano . A beagle pack , thirty-some strong , was bounding across a pasture . We got out and hurried in the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting except that the quarry is hare , and it 's done without benefit of horses . Beaglers follow the pack-at a very brisk pace-on foot . Hunting hares with beagles is banned by the Hunting Act . But rabbits can still be hunted . " Because they 're considered pests , " Tom said . " Because a lot of Labour voters hunt rabbits , " Adrian said . Also , for some reason , " the hunting of a hare which has been shot " is permitted . The pack arced away from us across a broad field . Just as it did , the hare that the beagles were n't supposed to be hunting came at the three of us with a speed hardly credible in a land animal . Tf it had been less nimble ( and bigger ) , it would have bowled us over . The dogs seemed to have lost the scent . " The hare went that way ! " Tom shouted to the master of the beagle hounds . " The shot hare ! " Adrian shouted . " The " bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . We spent an hour with the beagles . They no more got a bush rabbit than Tom and Adrian had got a stag , but the clambering and clamor of the beagles was a joy . I 'm a strong advocate for animal rights . I am an animal . I belong to Animal NATO-us , dogs , horses ( cats are France ) . And I belong to Animal WTO . We export feed to sheep , cows , pigs , and chickens , and , to maintain the balance of trade , we eat them . The Yandles gave a dinner that night . Their house was of Middlemarch era but with fewer old bores writing the Key to All Mythologies , and with more stag heads on the walls . The main course was pork roast from a farm pig , rather than venison from the Exmoor stag ( which in any case would have needed to hang for a week ) . Miscellaneous small terriers sat on guests ' laps . The consensus of the party was that the hunting ban had to do less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a class struggle , I was told . The working class was all for hunting , Baroness Ann Mallalieu said . And she was a Labour peer . Nor was it , she said ( she herself proved the point ) , a Labour-Tory conflict . Instead , all agreed , a certain kind of today 's urban elite was getting back at what they saw as a traditional elitism that had no use , as Tom Yandle put it , for people " with shaved heads and five earrings and their husbands just as bad . " But , all agreed again , hunts are n't as posh as they used to be-and they never were . In a way , the bullies are understandable . There 's a certain satisfaction in taking something away from people perceived as having been too certain and self-confident for too long , people who 've dominated society but whose dominance is slipping away . Network news anchors come to mind . Then again , the bullies are n't understandable . Adrian used to be the master of foxhounds at the Quorn hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With balaclavas pulled down like the IRA , " Adrian said . " One told me , " We 'll smash up your car tonight , Adrian . ' They knew me by name . They did n't smash my car . They broke every window in my house . I found my dog and her litter of pups covered in shards of glass . " Several of the other guests hunted foxes as well as stags . The fox hunts were doing all right since the hunting ban . They 'd taken up " drag hunting . " Someone rides ahead pulling cloth soaked in fox scent behind him . The hounds and the hunters follow his course . And if an actual fox pops up along the way ... well , who can blame the dogs ? Ninety-one foxes were killed on the first day of the hunting ban . But what will the country pub of the future be named ? The Something That Smells Like a Fox and Hounds ? In a cultivated , sonorous voice Mike Hobday , spokesman for the League Against Cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The League Against Cruel Sports was founded in 1924 , with antecedents dating to Hogarth 's The Four Stages of Cruelty . Here are a few of the league 's past presidents : Edith Sitwell , Lord Grey de Ruthyn , the Rt . Hon. the Earl of Listowel , the Reverend Lord Soper . And a brochure published by the league shows how long and deep is the controversy in Britain about man and his relationship with the animals that are his friends , his relatives , and his dinner . In 1822 Britain passed a law against improper treatment of cattle , the first animal-welfare legislation in history . In 1835 Britain outlawed dogfighting , cockfighting , bullbaitiiig , bearbaiting , and badger baiting . In 1929 the Labour Party adopted a platform plank opposing blood sports ( although it held four parliamentary majorities before it fulfilled that campaign promise ) . " There 's a long history of criticism of hunting , " Mike said . " The people who established the League Against Cruel Sports had a background in the humanitarian movement-animal suffering , welfare of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the humanitarian movement had trouble prioritizing . I did ask , " Why the focus on hunting rather than , say , factory farming , with its animal penitentiaries ? " " The reasons are twofold , " Mike said . " Firstly , fox hunting is an emotive issue . The sight of the blood and gore tugs at the heartstrings . It makes powerful television . " " Secondly , " Mike said , " hunting is done for entertainment . It 's a sport . " I asked why the law permitted hunting rabbits but not hares . " The league 's view is that cruelty to any animal in the name of sport is wrong . Parliament 's view was to make a distinction between activities that were " necessary " and activities that were undertaken for sport . " The Countryside Alliance is the principal British pro-hunting group . Apparently both the league and the alliance enjoy majority support among the British public . According to a 1997 Gallup poll for The Daily Telegraph , 80 percent of Britons disapproved of hunting foxes with hounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 70 percent of Britons believed the police should not enforce the hunting ban . I wanted to know why hunting ( that is , chasing animals with dogs ) was banned but shooting ( pointing or flushing animals with dogs ) was n't . " With shooting , " Mike said , " there are clear steps that people can take to minimize suffering . " Photograph // Being a better shot was the only one T could think of , and I 've been trying for forty years to no avail . " Using a pack of dogs , " Mike continued , " with the best will in the world , you ca n't do much about the cruelty . And in practical terms it 's impossible to have legislation that covers everything . " I asked if class conflict was involved in the hunting ban . " From our perspective , " Mike said , " there 's no class element at all . Hare coursing is banned , though it 's working-class . " ( Hare coursing is letting greyhounds chase hares in a field-a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) " In the minds of ordinary people , " Mike said , hunting is " not an issue of class but an issue of behavior . " He added , " Hunters are seen to behave in a very arrogant fashion-hunts going through small holdings and gardens . Hunters are very poor about apologizing . There 's an attitude of entitlement by hunters : " It 's our land , and we have the right . ' ' " In America that would be all the apologizing needed . I mentioned how different America was-how Senator Kerry had n't been able to get through his presidential campaign without going on a goose hunt , so there 'd be a photo of him holding a gun . " But not a goose , " Mike said . Mike told me an anecdote , though he said he could n't vouch for it personally . Someone on the league 's staff had told it to him . At a fox-hunting protest , before the ban , one of the protesters had gone up to a hunter and said , " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hunter looked down from his horse and said , " People like you obey the law . People like us make the law . " The point of the anecdote is contradicted by what I saw in Exmoor , and exactly opposite to what has happened legislatively , but it still makes good telling . That is , if you understand what 's going on in Britain . I do n't . I walked from the League Against Cruel Sports offices , in Southwark , to the nearby Tate Modern , to look at the works of Damien Hirst . He is the artist who has floated a sheep in formaldehyde and sliced a cow into sections and so forth for the sake of sculpture . He is a today's-urban-elite kind of artist - cutting- edge , one might say . Unfortunately , the Tate Modern had only one piece by Hirst on display : some seashells with a curator 's commentary on the wall beside them . " You kill things to look at them , " Hirst has said . In this work he arranges a selection of ornate shells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resembling a museum display case for Pete 's sake , it was a museum display case , it alludes to the 19th century tradition of collecting and classifying natural specimens . Inevitably , the approach involves removing plants and animals from their natural habitats , killing them in order to preserve them ... But Hirst was not buying seashells for sport . In the grassy median of Park Lane , near Hyde Park Speakers ' Corner , is the Animals in War memorial- " Unveiled 24 November 2004 by Princess Anne . " Its two sweeping curves of stone wall resemble parts of a non-Euclidian traffic barrier . On the inside of one curve is carved THEY HAD NO CHOICE . Bronze pack mules march toward the gap between the walls . Beyond the gap a bronze dog and a bronze horse walk away , metaphorically in heaven , though actually farther up Park Lane . A eulogy mentions even pigeons . No need to cast one in bronze , though , with so many live ones alighting on the monument . Here are some British newspaper items I collected on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30,000 donation from the organiser of sponsored bird shoots because it does not approve of the way the money was raised . - The Sunday Telegraph , March 20 Professor John Webster , emeritus professor at Bristol University , discussed the intelligence of chickens at a conference organized by Compassion in World Farming ... They are intelligent , sensitive characters . - The Times , March 31 Nine New Forest firefighters were involved in freeing a frog from the spout of a watering can .

Mrs. Walker was found guilty of affray and possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence . - The Times , March 30 Of course , there 's always the possibility that Barmy Britannia-or a certain part of her-is crazy like a ... The more aspects of life that can be moved from private reign to public realm , the better it is for politics . Politicians do n't exactly want to ban hunting or forbid shooting teen goons with BBs . Politicians just want to turn everything , right down to what the dog chases , into a political matter . And they 've succeeded . The day I arrived in Britain , Tony Blair was beginning his run for reelection . The campaign issue making headlines was school lunch menus . Ordinary people have ordinary knowledge : how to make things ( including lunch ) , grow things , fix things , build things , and , for that matter , kill things . Politicians have extraordinary knowledge : how all things ought to be . Never mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the hare or hunt with the hounds . All things ought to be , as far as I 'm concerned , the way they were on Tom Yandle 's farm . When the dinner after the stag hunt was over , at one in the morning , Tom got up from the table and said , " I 'm going to change my trousers and have a look at the lambing . " More than a thousand of his ewes were on the verge of giving birth . A vet comes with a portable machine and gives them sonograms-better service than yuppie moms get . If a ewe is having one lamb , she can be left on her own in the fields . But twins can confuse a ewe , especially if it 's her first lambing . She may not know if both or either is hers . Tom went into a shed the size of a modest railroad station , where hundreds of sheep were in twenty or so pens . Then he climbed onto a wooden railing separating two banks of pens and , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine at dinner as I had , walked the rail 's length looking for newborns . When he spotted a pair , Tom would jump among the sheep , hoist each lamb by a leg , and begin backing toward the pen 's gate . This would cause at first a few , then a couple , and then , usually , just one of the ewes to follow him-the others dropping back with , frankly , sheepish looks as they ( I guess ) realized they had n't had any lambs yet . Then mother and children were put in a stall to bond . The lambs were still damp from birth , making their first steps , quad-toddling with each little hoof boxing the compass . They were adorable . Also , rather frequently , they were dead . Scores of dead lambs lay in the aisle of the lambing shed , nature being profligate with adorability . As man is . The living Iambs would be dead soon enough . Delicious , too . It 's tempting to meditate on how vivid and real the lambing was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself a political construct . Sheep farming is heavily subsidized in Great Britain . Without the subsidies the green grazing in the valley of the River Exe would be gone . The handsome agricultural landscape of which the British are so proud , carefully husbanded since Boudicca 's day , would be replaced by natural growth . The most likely growth is real-estate developments . There 's room for any number of charming weekend getaway homes where the tired politicians of London could get some relaxation and perhaps a bit of sport-of a noncontroversial kind .
