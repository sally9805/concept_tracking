We move each year in spring , like birds migrating , except we do n't go back to a familiar place . We never go back . We pack up who we are and the few things that cling to us , and drive away . We are good at packing . Good at leaving behind . We traveled three hundred miles today , and five hundred miles yesterday , pulling behind us a small humpbacked metal trailer that wobbles and slows us down . My father would be happy without that trailer , but he needs it to haul his canvases and art supplies , allowing us the rest of the space inside for our things as an afterthought . " Oh , I suppose we need clothes , " he will mutter , as we load in our cardboard boxes filled with my mother 's encyclopedias , my brother 's comics , my sister 's stuffed animals , my record player and 45 's . " But what 's the rest of this stuff ? Do we need it ? " An hour off the highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a town , my father turns toward the three of us in the back seat . " We 're almost there , " he says as my mother drives down a two-lane blacktop road exactly like every other two-lane road that has brought us , last year and the years before , to almost there . These roads inevitably lead to dirt lanes which we travel up , or down , or around some river , or through some bog , to where we will live for the next year , places where the occasional house stands out like a bright rainbow on a dark day . Today we turn right , onto a narrow but paved road : Moore . The woods are dense , arching over the road like arms reaching for each other infright . My teeth are clenched and my jaw hurts . As always , I have convinced myself that this time we will be living in a suburb of some sort , or maybe the tail end of a town , where there are sidewalks , and porches , where people watch neighbors come and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I once lived in a place with a sidewalk , but I was three and do n't remember . We drive over a hill and down the other side . " This must be it , " my father says . " It 's a mile since we turned . Yes . There it is . This is it , kids . " I can hardly breathe , because what I notice first is that I do n't know which house he means , because there are two houses , directly facing each other from across the road . One is a pretty farmhouse with brown shingles , white trim , a front porch , and a big red barn . There are acres of mowed grass and a cow pasture that spreads out behind the barn and up the hill . I can see lace curtains wave from the open windows . Across the road is a tar-papered house , with no porch , and a half-dozen cars scattered about a mangy yard , the grilles glistening in the late sun like the teeth of rabid dogs . If my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not get out of the car . I would rather die . We turn left , onto the stony driveway of the farmhouse . I want to shout with joy . I am so relieved it 's the pretty farmhouse , and so excited we have actual neighbors , but as I get out of the car I look again at the house across the road and shudder , imagining who must live there : an old hermit with warts and a beard down to his knees . Just my luck . It is the spring of 1954 . I will be fifteen in two weeks . For the next year we will live in the farthest outskirts of Mayville , in western New York , so my father can paint . His scenic oil paintings make everything seem lovely , idyllic , beautiful . But actually living in these places is quite different . From up close , the country is a deadly boring place , where people rust like old cars . Even as we drive up , I imagine us leaving . These rented houses come fully furnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always moved far away and we never see them , but this house belongs to a Mr. and Mrs. Burns who have gone to live at her sister 's house right in town , while she stays with a dying aunt in Albuquerque . They have left their dog here . It barks at us when we get out of the car , staying hidden under a hydrangea bush by the front porch . As my father unlocks the trailer , he yells at us to leave the dog alone , that it needs to get used to us first . I 've never had a dog before . Entering a new house for the first time is like getting on a ride at the amusement park . The anticipation is always better . I imagine secret tunnels through closets , hidden rooms , forgotten diaries , maybe even a canopy bed with gauzy white lace just for me . I should know better by now . Carrying my pillow , I follow my mother along the flat slate stones that lead from the end of the drive to a side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen . There is a round pine table with two wooden chairs , floral cushions tied to the seats . The green linoleum floor is covered with a road map of fine lines and gray scuff marks . I figure this is where the Burns ate , not in the dining room , which looks formal and dark . In the back of the kitchen is a big mudroom , with steps leading down into the basement . The refrigerator is in the mudroom , empty and well scrubbed , the door propped open like a hungry mouth . In a year , I will clean it out and leave it just like this . It is my job . In the living room there is an overstuffed couch , a matching chair , and end tables covered with starched old-lady doilies . No family pictures , just landscapes , which my father will hate because they are dull and uninspired . It does n't matter what is on the walls though , because within the next hour my mother will take them all down and put up my father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the painting of my mother , completely naked , sitting on a chair with her legs crossed , one arm folded over her head , the other barely covering her crotch . She 'll hang it in some prominent spot in the living room , where you ca n't miss it no matter how hard you try . My mother modeled nude for art classes and that is how my parents met . When kids ask me if that 's my mother on the wall with the big boobs , I lie and say no , it 's just someone who looks like her . If she hears me , she 'll correct me , and tell the story about how she met my father , with more details than anyone wants to know . Robert , Megan , and I run upstairs . There are four very small bedrooms , one in the front of the house with a double bed , which we leave for my parents . I call the bedroom that faces the road and the tar-papered house . The room has yellow wallpaper and a picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bat . I do n't know who he is , but I 'll leave it there . I have nothing to put in its place , unless I want to put up some of my father 's paintings , which I do n't . The bed is neatly made with a plain white quilt . No canopy . I throw my pillow on the bed to claim it . Megan and Robert fight over one of the other bedrooms . They know better than to mess with me . Going back downstairs I see my mother moving an end table over by the front window . Then she moves a chair up against a wall , and asks me to help her move the couch . In the dining room we slide the heavy table up against the wall so there are only three sides to sit at , and then we cover a small dark mahogany cabinet with a sheet and carry it into the basement . We are making room for my father 's stretched canvases , his two easels , his toolbox , cut lumber , rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charcoals , and his crates of linseed oil and turpentine . By nightfall , my mother will have removed the curtains in the living room , so more light will come in . This shifting of furniture always makes me nervous . I worry we are not where we are supposed to be , that some mistake has been made . These people may be out to lunch and come home . I will feel this way for weeks . We unpack the trailer quickly , competently , just as we packed it , as if those minutes we save will make our stay seem longer , as if by emptying the trailer and stashing it on the far side of the barn , we can pretend we have lived here all along . The dog , whose name is Kip , comes out from his hiding spot , and with his tail between his legs he inches up to us and sniffs our feet . He is an old beagle with sad eyes and short brittle hair that seems to break off rather than shed , and his ears hang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father says the Burns did n't take Kip with them because they now live next to a busy street , and they are afraid he might get hurt . He is supposed to stay outside . There is also an enormous black bull , two dozen beef cattle , and a milk cow . The beef cattle stay in the back pasture and Mr. Burns told my father we should just ignore them . The milk cow has another pasture , off to the right of the barn , and the bull has his own pen , about two acres , between the barn and the beef cattle . Before we moved here , my father assured the Burns he knew about cows , then my mother went to the library . She will be in charge of milking the dairy cow . Just after my mother leaves to go get some groceries , some people pull up the driveway and get out . My stomach turns . But they wave and address my father by name . The Burns have come to see us get settled . Luckily we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to open the door and ask them in . Mr. Burns is a heavy man who is almost bald ; he has more hair coming out his ears than covering his head . Even though he 's bald , I do n't think he is as old as my father , who 's almost sixty and has a full head of thick white hair . Mr. Burns wears overalls and a plaid flannel shirt , and his round basketball belly presses taut against the front of his overalls . Mrs. Burns is very short and just as round as Mr. Burns , but her head is covered with tight brown curls . Her eyes are the green of wet grass . She wears jeans and a plaid shirt , and the clunkiest brown shoes I have ever seen . She glances over at the house , and her face kind of freezes as if she is lost in thought . Mr. Burns touches her on the arm and she turns away . They smile at us , but just quick smiles , with their lips closed . Mr. Burns shakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Burns ' voice is gravelly , like it was used too much and wants to quit working . " We wo n't come in , " Mr. Burns says . " We do n't want to intrude . Just introduce ourselves and make sure you got in all right . Any trouble finding the place ? " My father says the directions were perfect , and thanks for the letters they sent with maps and notes about the house . The dog has scrambled out from under the hydrangea at the sound of the Burns ' car and is beside himself with excitement . He rolls on his back and Mr. Burns squats down to scratch his belly . His tail thumps on the ground , scattering pebbles in its wake . " Well , you must be worn out , " Mr. Burns says , straightening back up . " But there are a few things I think you might want to know . " He tells us kids that we are allowed to wander in the milk cow 's pasture , which is fifteen acres and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have some adult supervision . He also tells us to stay away from the bull , which does n't really need saying . The bull looks as if he has a constant headache and if you glance at him funny he might decide to kill you . He has horns about a foot long that curl into deadly points . " There 're some tools out in the barn , " Mr. Burns says to my father . He pulls at his earlobe and nods his head toward the barn . " Let me show you where they are . " It 's my mother he should be showing . The only thing my father can do is paint . " Well , " Mrs. Burns says , " I was hoping to talk to your mother about the cow . " She looks at me , since I 'm the oldest , but I do n't know what to say . After a minute of uncomfortable silence , she says , " Well , I guess I should show you then . " I nod , and return her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm supposed to do . " Well , follow me , " she says . Megan and Robert stick close to me as I follow Mrs. Burns to a gate where the barbed-wire fence meets the back right corner of the barn . Mrs. Burns unclips a hook , and the gate swings open . The cow , white with black splotches , is in the field , right past the muddy area behind the barn . It raises its head and stares at us . " Just do n't move too fast , " she says . " And watch where you step . " The cow freezes in mid chew as we approach . She holds so still you can tell she 's alive only by the fact she 's standing . As we get a few feet away she stumbles backwards , but Mrs. Burns calls out , " Hey , sweetie , come here , sweetie , " and the cow freezes again . Mrs. Burns puts her hand on the cow 's wide nose , and it moos . Robert jumps a foot . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let her get used to you . Give her a pat . You 've been around cows before , right ? " Remembering what my father has told us , we all nod . Megan , the youngest , is the first one to touch the cow , then me . My brother , Robert , hangs back , as if he is waiting his turn , which , if it 's up to him , will be never . He 's wearing his stupid Davy Crockett hat , as if he is some brave hunter , but he 's really just a coward . A fat little chubby coward . His ears stick out under his hat like handles . The cow feels like the dog , sort of bristly yet soft . She 's warm to the touch , and her skin moves against her body as if it 's not connected to the muscles in the same way ours is . She smells like nothing I ever smelled before , which is what I presume is the smell of cow , which is hard to separate from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say your mother knows how to milk a cow ? " Mrs. Burns says , sounding concerned , maybe even doubtful we have a mother at all . We nod . If reading dozens of books can teach you how to milk a cow , then my mother knows how . " Well then , all right . Let 's go back now . " Mrs. Burns is so bent over she has no problem looking where she 's walking . And now I know why she wears those shoes . Mine are covered with mud , and probably manure . I 'd throw them away , but they are my only pair of sneakers . Mrs. Burns shows us how to close the gate . " Always make sure you close it behind you , " she says . " I would n't want the cow to get out and wander on the road . " Their car is the second car I 've seen on this road since we came here . The cow would probably be safe taking a nap right dab in the middle of the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's her name ? " Megan asks in her sweet little voice she does so well . " Well , I guess she does n't have a name . She 's a cow . " Megan and I look at each other . Mr. Burns and my father are waiting by the Burns ' car . " If you do n't mind , " Mr. Burns says , " I 'd like to come by on Sundays after church , to check on the cattle , set out some fresh hay . I wo n't be a bother to you at all . " " Not a bother at all , " my father says . " We go to the Methodist church in Westfield , about a forty-minute ride from here , " Mrs. Burns offers . " There 's also a nice Baptist church right in Mayville and a Presbyterian church way over in Jamestown . We can give you directions . " " Do n't worry , " my father says . " We 'll be fine . " There is silence for a minute while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his ear . " Gosh , " he says . " I did n't think to ask if you all are Jewish . With a name like Anderson , I did n't think about you being Jewish . " He looks over at Mrs. Burns , as if maybe this is a problem . " Oh , we 're not Jewish , " my father says . The Burns look relieved . They even laugh . " All right then , we 'll see you Sunday , about one . " They get in their car . Kip moves quickly and hops right over Mrs. Burns and into the front seat . Mr. Burns has to drag him out . Nose almost scraping the ground , tail between his legs , Kip goes back to the hydrangea bush . " See you Sunday , " Mr. Burns says , maybe to the dog , maybe to us . They drive off . If my mother were here she would have told them right out that we 're atheists . But my father is like me in just this one way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to . No one 's ever asked us if we 're Jewish before . I wonder which is worse . ( Continues ... )
