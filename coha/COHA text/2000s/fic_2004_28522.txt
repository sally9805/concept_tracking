Chapter One Midas , New Mexico April 1885 " What in God 's name is all that racket ? " Her husband 's voice rasped in Jayne Dawson 's ear . She and Hank had been married less than a week and were sharing a real bed for the second time . He 'd been whispering that this time would be better than the first , when someone had started pounding on the door to their room in the Midas Hotel . " Criminy , " he muttered . " He 's got ta be mixed up . " As Hank went back to nuzzling her neck , Jayne closed her eyes to block out the intrusion . When the man coughed again , she stiffened like a fence post . " Hank , maybe we should - " Silencing her with a kiss , her husband stroked her breast . The rhythm was too quick for her . She needed time to catch up with him , maybe a little sweet talk , anything to take her mind off the stranger standing just outside their door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down her neck . Rap . Rap . Rap . Jayne turned her head against the pillow . " Hank , I ca n't do this with someone standing in the hall . " " He 'll go away . Just relax . " Knock . Knock . Knock . " I know you 're in there , Jesse . " " Shit ! " Hank leaped off her as if he 'd been struck by a bullet . Moonlight turned his body bone-white as he snatched his pants off thechair and hurried into them . He put on a shirt , then pulled his Peace-maker out of the gunbelt and cocked the hammer . " Hide , Jayney , " he ordered . " Get under the covers and do n't move a muscle . " " Who 's Jesse ? " He shook his head . " Just do what I say . " It was n't in Jayne 's nature to obey anyone , but being stark naked put her at a distinct disadvantage . She scooted lower on the bed , flattened herself against the mattress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door behind him . She strained to hear through the thick oak , but the tinny music from a nearby saloon masked the voices in the hall . She lowered the sheet an inch and peeked over the hem . The oil lamp flickered against the ivory wall , casting shadows through the gloom as a sinister chortle reached her ears . Her gaze narrowed to the doorknob just as it began to turn . Was it Hank ? Or the stranger with the rasping cough ? She would have given a month of Sundays to have been wearing her best dress , or any dress for that matter , but she settled for leaping out of bed and shoving her arms into the cotton wrapper Hank had tossed on the floor . There had n't been time for a fancy trousseau like the ones she had stitched for the Lexington well-to-do . A week ago she 'd been disappointed . Now she was just glad to be covered . Clutching the flaps of the garment around her middle , she dropped to a crouch in front of her trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stranger came at her , she 'd fight with her last breath before she 'd let him touch her . And she had a few things to say to Hank , too . He owed her an explanation . As her fingers gripped the scissors , Hank slipped back into the room , turned the lock and braced both hands high against the door . With his wheat-colored hair and slim build , he reminded her of the little Dutch boy with his finger in the dike . Still clutching the scissors , she pushed up from the crouch . " Who was that man ? " Her husband raised his face to the plaster ceiling , blew out a breath , then dropped his arms to his sides and faced her squarely . " Do you remember when I told you I had a past ? " How could she forget ? They 'd been alone in the tiny sitting room above her mother 's dress shop . He 'd told her she was the best thing that had ever happened to him and that he wanted a fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he 'd been a lawman in Wyoming and that he 'd killed a good man by mistake . " There are things I ca n't tell you , " he had said . " But if you can see fit to forgive me for my secrets , I 'll love you forever . " Forgiveness sprung from her soul as easily as water from an abundant well . She 'd met him in church just two months earlier on Christmas Eve , and never before had she seen a man with such soulful eyes . His sun-bleached hair had been tipped with gold , like the ornamental angels hanging in the snow-crusted windows of the sanctuary . " God can forgive anything , " she 'd said . " And so can I. " Until tonight , not once had it occurred to her that the past might not be ready to forgive him . How naive she 'd been . But thoughts of California had stirred her blood . She had wanted to see more of the world than the streets of Lexington , and so she had trusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tying a knot in the belt to her robe , she made her voice firm . " You have to tell me everything , Hank . Right now . " His shoulders rounded as he blew out a breath and faced her . " I will , Jayney , as soon as I get back . But I have to go with this man . I 've got something he wants , and that means I 'm going to be gone for a few days . " " A few days ? This is crazy . We should go to the sheriff right now . He 'll help us . " He shook his head . " Going to the locals will just make things worse . " " Are you sure ? " " I 'm positive . We 'll talk as soon as I get back , but until then , stay in the hotel . If I 'm not here in three days , that 's when you need to go to the law . " She watched as he slipped into his old brown duster . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secret pocket for safekeeping . " Hank , our savings - " " Trust me , Jayney . I 'll be back , but I might need something that 's in that pouch . " She understood how it felt to be poor and friendless . She wanted to grab her scissors and cut out the money , but his eyes were pleading with her to believe in him . Besides , she 'd spoken her wedding vows from the heart and she believed in keeping promises . " All right , " she said . " But hurry . I 'll be worried . " After he lifted his hat off the bedpost , Hank brushed his lips against hers , a soft kiss that tasted like goodbye . Which is exactly what it turned out to be .
