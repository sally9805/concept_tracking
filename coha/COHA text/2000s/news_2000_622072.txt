<p> WASHINGTON 'S THE REAL MONOPOLY <p> Editor  --  Let me get this straight : The same political , bureaucratic and judicial institutions and mind-sets that gave us the Internal Revenue Code , dysfunctional public schools and the war in Vietnam will decide how to best serve the public interest in splitting up and running Microsoft ? <p> Could it be that Microsoft 's real crime was that it had the audacity and arrogance to assume it did n't have to play along with the Washington protection racket like fellow monopolists Intel , Boeing , Lockheed Martin and Archer Daniels Midland ? Do you suppose a thoroughly politicized Justice Department would have ever brought this case to trial had Bill Gates , Paul Allen , Steve Balmer , et alia , been substantial contributors to the Democratic and Republican National Committees over the years ? <p> RICK ZALON <p> Novato <p> . <p> TYRANNY IN CORCORAN <p> Editor  --  The acquittal of the Corcoran prison guards is another step in society 's frightening acquiescence to creeping tyranny , unfortunately not surprising in a state headed by their playmate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning to the jurors that no prisoner at Corcoran has been shot since these acquittees were charged  --  that they 'd better get them back in there to " do their jobs " ? Shame , shame , shame . By the way , the placement of this story next to the one about Bolinas  --  interesting . . . <p> MARGARET LITTLEFIELD <p> Bolinas <p> . <p> JUDGES NOT ALONE <p> Editor  --  I am bemused that you think California 's judges are " woefully underpaid " at salaries averaging $117,000 a year , and would write an editorial about it ( Give State 's Judges a Raise , June 5 ) . Not that I necessarily disagree with your position ; however , as a doctorate-holding tenured full professor of mathematics for the California State University with 37 years of teaching experience  --  making barely $72,000 a year !  --  I wonder why you have n't editorialized with equal force on the need for raising CSU faculty salaries . <p> We have had minuscule raises during the past decade , which have barely kept us up with the inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the California Post-Secondary Education Commission , with respect to which the CSU is about 12 percent behind . We keep hearing promises from the chancellor and the trustees that the gap will be closed , but every time they move us ahead , the target moves up also . We 've been about this same amount behind for most of the last decade . <p> Meanwhile , we keep putting out graduates who , in some cases , go to work in industries for starting salaries that are larger than those of our senior professors ! Whole departments are contemplating walking out of here and going to work for real wages , where our talents will be appreciated . Granted , our line of work has its bonuses : a lot of autonomy , the life of the mind , participating in the intellectual and personal growth of our students , flexible schedules , etc . But the government can not expect to preserve this institution on the willingness of its faculty to take vows of poverty . <p> RICK LUTTMANN , Ph.D . <p> Sonoma State University <p> Rohnert Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Many of us maintain a cavalier disinterest in what goes on in the state Legislature . But The Chronicle has recently reported on two bills of so much local importance that I am compelled to shout " Heads up ! " The first is AB 1800 , carried by Assemblywoman Helen Thomson , D-Davis , that would change the protocol for helping the mentally ill . It is the first attempt to amend the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act which had the unintended consequence of leaving many of the state 's mentally ill people on the street to fend for themselves . Particularly in cities like San Francisco . The bill is in jeopardy because it is being blocked by state Sen. John Burton who , as a San Franciscan , should know better . <p> The second is a measure by Assemblyman Bill Leonard , R-Rancho Cucamonga , ( AB 1838 ) that would allow public officials who own rental property to vote on housing issues . Right now , four San Francisco supervisors are routinely recused from voting and , even worse , are not allowed to even discuss these matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange on rent control issues is nonexistent at the board level . I have gone to Sacramento to attend Fair Political Practices Commission meetings three times in the last month and received little indication that a change will occur there . This bill , safeguarded by the Brown and Sunshine Acts ' mandatory economic disclosures , promises to finally give representation to property owners at the Board of Supervisors . It , too , is certain to be blocked by Burton , whose anti-property-owner bias is no secret . Please contact his office at ( 916 ) 445-1412 and weigh in on these important issues . <p> KAREN CROMMIE <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> OUTDATED MEMO <p> Editor  --  I was disappointed to see that you published an article focusing on a memo I wrote six months ago about my concerns regarding Al Gore 's environmental record . I think it is unfair and misleading to take an outdated e-mail written in the context of the Gore versus Bill Bradley race , and to use it in the context of the Gore versus George Bush race . <p> My original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sierra Club  --  months ago . But there has never been a debate inside the Club on Mr. Bush 's status as environmental villain No. 1 . <p> Bush 's henchmen at the Republican National Committee , who distributed this dated e-mail , failed to ask me my opinion on the worrisome governor 's lackluster environmental leadership . <p> Under Gov . Bush 's sinister tenure , Texas has racked up a lot of firsts : <p> No. 1 in the emission of ozone-causing air pollution chemicals ; <p> No. 1 in toxic chemical releases into the air ; <p> No. 1 in the use of deep well injectors as method of waste disposal ; <p> No. 1 in counties listed in the top 20 of emitting cancer-causing chemicals ; <p> No. 1 in total number of hazardous-waste incinerators ; <p> No. 1 in Environmental Justice Title 6 complaints ; <p> No. 1 in the production of cancer-causing benzene and vinyl chloride ; and No. 1 in the largest sludge dump in the country . <p> The record speaks for itself . Voting for Bush is the kiss of ecological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lives of our children and our future . <p> MICHAEL DORSEY <p> Director , Sierra Club <p> National Board <p> Ann Arbor , Mich . <p> . <p> BUCKS BEHIND BELIEFS ' <p> Editor  --  Both candidates for the office of president of the United States have injected their own brand of religion into the campaign . <p> I refer to proposals for " faith-based charities , " being funded by the federal government , and the concept of " compassionate conservatism , " as the goal of the other candidate . It would be helpful if the press asked each candidate to make available to the public their charitable contributions deducted on their income tax form for the past five years . <p> MICHAEL J. FRANZBLAU <p> San Rafael <p> . <p> ART OF SIMPLICITY <p> Editor  --  The twisted tower shown in the rendering in the June 8 Chronicle of the planned de Young Museum is a real abomination ! What 's more , the whole idea of a tower is a mistake . It will prove expensive to maintain as well as to build . And who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a view ? <p> To assume that it takes a tower to attract the public sells short the appeal of art itself and of art-related programs . In building an art museum , the priority should be flexible , secure and easily maintained exhibition spaces so that the de Young will be able to hose some of the exciting world-class exhibitions that San Francisco has gone without in recent years . <p> SUSAN MARTIN <p> Ross <p> . <p> A GOOD LAUGH <p> Editor  --  I usually get my Monday morning laughs from Jon Carroll or Doonesbury , but fellow retiree , Judge Gardiner , gave me more than one belly laugh with his debut as a comedy writer in Letters on June 12 . Discussing our need to fear " direct voting " and the " uninformed " ( the people , that is ) he came up with some great ( if somewhat long ) one-liners . <p> But he did leave us wanting for a couple of good final punch lines after admonishing us to listen to what the past has to tell us . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned in over the past 65-plus years ? <p> 1 . Arrogance born of ignorance is multiplied by success . <p> 2 . Republicanism : socialism for the rich , capitalism for the poor . <p> 3 . Judge not , that ye not be judged . <p> ROBERT A.
