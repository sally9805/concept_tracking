THEY SPENT THE WINTER GETTING READY . NOW THESE GUYS AND GIRLS FACE THEIR TOUGHEST CHALLENGE : 35 MILES DOWN ONE MAD RIVER . Photograph Photograph Photograph Angelica de Rosa ( left ) and Andrea Patterson battle the white water on one " mad " river . Photograph The Ventures of Crew 849 take a break from the white water conditions and enjoy the flat water of Kaminiskeg Lak. // But these canoeists , Venturers from Crew 849 and Scouts from Troop 849 , Niagara Falls , N.Y. , are ready . They spent ifluch of the winter training : watching canoeing videos , practicing their swimming and lilesaving skills and completing a whitewater course with an instructor from the American Canoe Association . They 'd been looking to show off their new skills , so they signed up with Birchbark Expeditions , a highadventure program run by the Greater Niagara Frontier Council . The program normally takes its participants on flat-water trips out of Algonquin Park in Ontario , Canada . But since this group has come prepared , in the summer of 2005 they get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lucky them . " I 'm excited and nervous at the same time , " says 15-year-old Life Scout John McCarthy . It will be a four-day , 35-mile journey that will test them on everything they 've learned . FOLLOW THE GUIDE Algonquin contains the headwaters of five major rivers , one of which is the Maclawaska . To reach the put-in on The Mad , the group has to paddle five miles across Bark Lake . Photograph Christina de Rosa , Kelly Patterson and Andrea Patterson ( left to right ) share a laugh while taking a swim in the Madawaska River . // Their first challenge of the trip comes early . The waves on Bark Lake do n't exactly scream out " flat water . " The group decides to go for it , fighting a strong headwind in their six canoes just to reach the section of the trip that 's supposed to be the hardest . They finally arrive at the first rapids , known as Siberian Ripples No. 1 . While taking a break to look down the river , crew Advisor Pierre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't beat the rapids . The rapids allow you to pass-if you 're prepared . " His crew is not easily impressed . " Great , " 14-year-old Venturer Kelly Patterson says . " Some pep talk . " The group gets a clue to what they 're in for when guide Charles Feller , a canoeing instructor , promptly " swamps " his solo canoe as he nosedives into the very first rapid . Maybe he was just showing off-the rest of the group makes it through just fine , thanks to Feller pointing the way . Same goes for Siberian Ripples No. 2 , and everyone thanks their guide for showing them how NOT to handle the rapids . RUMP BUMPING DOWN THE RAPIDS The group does n't have to wait long for someone who is n't a guide to go for an accidental swim . Venturers Andrea Patterson and Cristina de Rosa , both 17 , look as though they are going to emerge from Cottage Rapids unscathed , until water starts pouring over the bow as they go over one last drop . They make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rock as their canoe shoots down the river and wraps around another rock . " The scariest part was flipping in the rapids , " Cristina says . " I thought 1 was going to die . " Thank goodness for the unofficial paddler 's code : Always help a paddler in need , because tomorrow you may be the one who needs help . Some passing canoeists help Andrea and Cristina , but not before they catch a glimpse of Feller floating on his rear down the rapids while clinging to his canoe ... again . After spending the night at a campsite on Mud Bay . a wide , calm part of the river , the group rises early the next morning to beat the wind . They 've got three and a half miles of flat water on Kaminiskeg Lake ahead of them , and they do n't want a repeat of thgir struggles on Bark Lake . PLAY TIME The next whitewater spot . Palmer Rapids , provides another twist . Feller informs the group that they 're going to " play " in these rapids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canoes 150 yards and do them multiple times-assuming they survive the first . Playing in the same set of rapids helps canoeists get familiar with the power of the water . After scouting the safest path , they place signalers at the beginning and end of the run . One duo swamps the first time , so the group goes back and goes through the rapids again . The second time , everybody makes it through perfectly . The third time is just for fun . " It was a learning experience to respect the water , " 13-year-old Star Scout Joey de Rosa says . " I found out that I could have fun , but now I really respect the power of the water while I 'm having fun . " The next day , on Aumond 's Rapids , everybody looks like pros . Even the real pro , Feller , manages to make it through without swamping . All that preparation over the winter is finally paying off . " Clean air , clean river to paddle in ... millions of stars at night , " 16-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the elements , nothing else really matters .

And partly because you have to be crazy to tackle its mix of grueling flat water and fast-moving whitewater .
