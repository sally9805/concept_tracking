" Well , " the bookstore manager said , " it is Valentine 's Day . " <p> It 's not that bad , Cassandra wanted to say in her own defense . But she never wanted to sound peevish or disappointed . She must smile , be gracious and self-deprecating . She would emphasize how wonderfully intimate the audience was , providing her with an opportunity to talk , have a real exchange , not merely prate about herself . Besides , it was n't tragic , drawing thirty people on a February night in the suburbs of San Francisco . On Valentine 's Day . Most of the writers she knew would kill for thirty people under these circumstances , under any circumstances . <p> And there was no gain in reminding the bookseller  --  Beth , Betsy , Bitsy , oh dear , the name had vanished , her memory was increasingly buggy  --  that Cassandra had drawn almost two hundred people to this same store on this precise date four years earlier . Because that might imply she thought someone was to blame for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in blame . She was famous for it . Or had been . <p> She also was famous for rallying , and she did just that as she took five minutes to freshen up in the manager 's office , brushing her hair and reapplying lipstick . Her hair , her worst feature as a child , was now her best , sleek and silver , but her lips seemed thinner . She adjusted her earrings , smoothed her skirt , reminding herself of her general good fortune . She had a job she loved ; she was healthy . Lucky , I am lucky . She could quit now , never write a word again , and live quite comfortably . Her first two books were annuities , more reliable than any investment . <p> Her third book  --  ah , well , that was the unloved , misshapen child she was here to exalt . <p> At the lectern , she launched into a talk that was already honed and automatic ten days into the tour . There was a pediatric hospital across the road from where I grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She used to get more men , but then her memoirs , especially the second one , had included unsparing detail about her promiscuity , a healthy appetite that had briefly gotten out of control in her early forties . It was a long-term-care facility , where children with extremely challenging diagnoses were treated for months , for years in some cases . Was that true ? She had n't done that much research about Kernan . The hospital had been skittish , dubious that a writer known for memoir was capable of creating fiction . Cassandra had decided to go whole hog , abandon herself to the libertine ways of a novelist . Forgo the fact-checking , the weeks in libraries , the conversations with family and friends , trying to make her memories gibe with hard , cold certainty . For the first time in her life  --  despite what her second husband had claimed  --  she made stuff up out of whole cloth . The book is an homage to The Secret Garden  --  in case the title does n't make that clear enough  --  and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when finding biological parents was still formidably difficult , almost taboo , a notion that began to lose favor in the 1990s and is increasingly out of fashion as biological parents gain more rights . It had never occurred to Cassandra that the world at large , much like the hospital , would be reluctant to accept her in this new role . The story is wholly fictional , although it 's set in a real place . <p> She read her favorite passage . People laughed in some odd spots . <p> Question time . Cassandra never minded the predictability of the Q-and-A sessions , never resented being asked the same thing over and over . It did n't even bother her when people spoke of her father and mother and stepmother and ex-husbands as if they were characters in a novel , fictional constructs they were free to judge and psychoanalyze . But it disturbed her now when audience members wanted to pin down the " real " people in her third book . Was she Hannah , the watchful child who unwittingly sets a tragedy in motion ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woodrow ? Were the parents modeled on her own ? They seemed so different , based on the historical record she had created . Was there a fire ? An accident in the abandoned swimming pool that the family could never afford to repair ? <p> " Did your father really drive a retired Marathon cab , painted purple ? " asked one of the few men in the audience , who looked to be at least sixty . Retired , killing time at his wife 's side . " I ask only because my father had an old DeSoto and . . ? . " <p> Of course , she thought , even as she smiled and nodded . You care about the details that you can relate back to yourself . I 've told my story , committed over a quarter of a million words to paper so far . It 's your turn . Again , she was not irked . Her audience 's need to share was to be expected . If a writer was fortunate enough to excite people 's imaginations , this was part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been and apparently would continue to be in the public 's mind , at least for now . She had told her story , and that was the cue for them to tell theirs . Given what confession had done for her soul , how could she deny it to anyone else ? <p> " Time for one last question , " the store manager said , and pointed to a woman in the back . She wore a red raincoat , shiny with moisture , and a shapeless khaki hat that tied under her chin with a leather cord . <p> " Why do you get to write the story ? " <p> Cassandra was at a loss for words . <p> " I 'm not sure I understand , " she began . " You mean , how do I write a novel about people who are n't me ? Or are you asking how one gets published ? " <p> " No , with the other books . Did you get permission to write them ? " <p> " Permission to write about my own life ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's your parents , your stepmother , friends . Did you let them read it first ? " <p> <br> Continues ...
