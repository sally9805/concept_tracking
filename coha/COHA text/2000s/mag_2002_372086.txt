A train barreled over Joseph Hewins ' body on a wintry evening in 1845 in the Massachusetts Berkshires . Hewins had spent the workday shoveling snow off the tracks , only to be killed on his trip back to town when a switchman got distracted . Hewins left behind a wife and three children , who were poor even before his death . His widow sued but lost at every level . Had the train merely chopped off Hewins ' leg , the railroad would have paid . But in the perverse logic of that time , when a man died , he took his legal claims with him . And so the thinking went for most of the century , until something unheard of began to happen . The courts started to put a dollar value on a life  --  after death . <P> The concept of assigning a price tag to a life has always made people intensely squeamish . After all , is n't it degrading to presume that money can make a family whole again ? And what of the disparities ? Is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ? Over the past 100 years , U.S. courts have crafted their answers to these questions . Forensic economists testify on the value of a life every day . They can even tell you the average valuation of an injured knee ( about $200,000 ) . But until now , the public at large has not had to reckon with the process and its imperfections . Until the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 created a small city 's worth of grieving families and the government established an unprecedented fund to compensate them , the mathematics of loss was a little-known science . Now the process is on garish display , and it is tempting to avert the eyes . <P> On the morning of Jan. 18 , about 70 family members file into the rows of crimson seats at the Norwalk , Conn. , city hall auditorium . They listen quietly to special master Kenneth Feinberg , whom the government has entrusted with dispersing its money to those most affected by the Sept. 11 tragedy . His first job is to persuade them to join the federal Victim Compensation Fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their families without placing blame . The effort is being closely watched for the precedents it will set . <P> Much has been made of the enormous charity funds raised after the attacks . Donations to those groups do funnel thousands of dollars to the victims ' families  --  in particular , the families of fire fighters and police officers . But overall , the nearly $2 billion in charity money is chump change compared with the cash that will flow out of government coffers . There is no limit to the federal fund , but the tab is likely to be triple the size of the charity pot . And while charity funds are doled out to a vast pool of people , including businesses hurt by the attacks , the government money will go exclusively to the injured and to families of the deceased . <P> Feinberg , in a black-and-white polka-dot tie , speaks in short , punchy sentences and a loud voice . He has already given the speech 32 times up and down the East Coast . The main thrust : The government , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checks to victims ' families without any litigation . The checks will arrive within four months after a claim is filed  --  no legal fees , no agonizing 10-year lawsuit . But every award will be based on a cold calculus , much the way courts handle wrongful-death claims .
