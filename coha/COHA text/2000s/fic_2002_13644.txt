( Roberto awakens , looks around , and covers himself . Blackout. ) @x Country music from a radio in the distance . The sound of Bill 's footsteps as he walks in , pushes a chair , then stops . After a moment a light switch flips on . Roberto is at a desk . Bill eyes him strangely and notices crunched-up paper balls , and maps spread over on the desk . Bill picks up Roberto 's shirt and gives it to him . He then heads to an exit and turns off the lights . At that instant , there is the sound of screeching train wheels , then bright blinding lights . In the blinding lights , Abuelita and the Aztec Skull Dancer appear again . They face each other , then exit . Roberto thinks he sees them , but then looks into the desert to reality . Silence . Reality . The blinding lights subside and Roberto and Bill are seen looking in different directions . A soft sunny glow is behind them , then finally , there is clarity . BILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goin ' to be a hot one . Yep . Willard Scott said hundred and twenty . ( No answer . ) You know , my wife ca n't sleep when it 's hot like this . I do n't mind .

He then starts toward the opposite direction . Roberto sees him and lifts his gun in the air and shoots . At the sound of the blast , Manuel stops , drops his suitcase , and turns around quickly throwing his hands up in a comical way . He then recognizes Roberto. ) p. 7 FELICITANOS Roberto !

Hopefully some of them worked at least a day to cover expenses . ( Uncomfortable , yet a kind silence . ) Adios , seor gato . ( Starts to exit. ) p. 10 MUNOZ Manuel , the van is over there .

Francisco is inside the boxcar . He hears sounds . He then waits for the sounds to pass before he moves . He then fiddles with a cardboard box that contains his belongings .

( Huero throws in a pillowcase filled with his belongings before jumping in . ) DELUNA ( Continues . ) Incredible ! No walking , no running . Just put our big butts on the floor and let a great train take us to the stars . Look , I have my Michael Jackson T-shirt , and this cap . With a skull on it . Que feo . And torn-up pants . I 'm dressed like an American . CEJA DE FIERRO Maybe you should n't talk so loud , huero . DELUNA ( Whispers at first , then gets increasingly louder . ) Oh , that 's right . I 'll be quiet . And you 're right about my name . Everyone calls me Huero . For this very light skin I have . There 's others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come close to my color . Just look at this skin . I 'm so fair , I get bad sunburns . But now I carry this . I wo n't get burned if I put this on . ( To Noel . ) I 'm Huero DeLuna . Are n't you jealous ? I can pass for an American much easier than you . They can pick you out in a crowd . Me ? I just blink my green eyes and say " Okay , " " all right , " and " no problem " and I pass for an American . Lucky skin , eh ? That 's why I refuse to tan . p. 14 MARTIN DE CABOS You still tan with that . That 's suntan lotion . DELUNA What ? Oh , no . That would be horrible . MARTIN DE CABOS You want a sunblock . Do you know what that is ? DELUNA A what ? No , that would ruin my skin . Do n't you know this skin is priceless ? CEJA DE FIERRO Your skin reeks of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I just look it . My mother and sister have the same skin color . Oh , the Spanish went everywhere and made friends with everybody , including the Indian women . That is why my father came out brown like coffee . I came out like my grandfather . ( To Noel . ) You are a little of both . Coffee with cream I would say . Almost the coloring of an Italian . ( To Francisco . ) And you are too dark I brought a bathing suit , sunglasses , and toilet paper  --  I 'm going to California . And the most important thing . I have dice . What 's in your little bag ? MARTIN DE CABOS Nothing much . Some water , and a book . DELUNA A book ? If you need toilet paper you can use mine .

CORTEZ ( Looks around . ) Just the four of us ? CEJA DE FIERRO The more they can stuff in here , the better the profit for them . CORTEZ Then , there should be more so they can get rich from us . To think they once did it for free ( Motions to Luis . ) He was under the train . I crawled under to ask him if he was going my direction . I must have startled him because he suddenly hit his head and passed out . He did n't make another sound so I pulled him out and carried him with me . CEJA DE FIERRO Luis . Wake up . DELUNA Do you know him ? CEJA DE FIERRO Luis . Open your eyes . Look at me , hombre . CORTEZ Well , if you know him , then it was right to bring him here . To be among friends . CEJA DE FIERRO Last year , I ran into him in the mountains . He told me he was looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was looking for Jericho. p. 16 DELUNA He 's waking up again . ( Luis opens his eyes and sees Huero , then passes out again . ) DELUNA What 's the matter ? CORTEZ He 's acting like he 's seen a ghost . DELUNA I 'm not that white . I 'm just a huero . What 's wrong with him ? CORTEZ ( Sternly . ) Yeah ! What kind of man are you ? SHINDAGO ( Off . ) A man fighting for survival Like us . ( Pepe opens the door . He has black oil all over him . They stare at him . ) SHINDAGO ( Continues . ) Well ? I 'm an old man , help me in . DELUNA ( Approaches then withdraws . ) " Aye canijo . " You smell . SHINDAGO You would too if you 've been where I just came from . ( Pepe winces with pain as he tries to get into the boxcar . Huero and Hernan help . ) SHINDAGO AYE ! Watch the legs ! ( Huero and Hernan struggle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat . ) SHINDAGO ( Continues . ) Aye . Aye ! Stop it ! You 're not helping this old man ! Idiots . ( Pepe stares coldly at Hernan and Huero and they laugh at this . ) What do you expect from the young and stupid . I 'll get in myself . ( Pepe crawls in slowly . ) If'el coyote ' tells you to hide in a barrel , tell him to eat shit . The border patrol are all over . Twice we had to reroute . Hijos de su shingada madre . How long are we to wait here ? p. 17 CEJA DE FIERRO We just wait until it 's time . SHINDAGO That 's what I do , wait until it 's time . I waited with many last night . El coyote could only take a few of us . He counted eight , then told us to get into barrels . I thought he was crazy , but I knew I had to do it . This method is too expensive , but he promises to keep us from being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHINDAGO But honestly . Look at the other choice : doing it yourself . My brother crossed on his own and got his throat cut by a " pollo " before he reached the border . I tried myself before , and that pinche " pollo " took all my money . Then had the audacity to demand my clothes . DELUNA They would n't want them now , they stink . SHINDAGO And so do you . MARTIN DE CABOS Then what happened ? SHINDAGO I pleaded like a meek Mexicano . I do that in emergencies . I said , " Please seor , you have all my money . Do n't take the clothes off my back . This is a terrible thing to ask of someone who could be as old as your father . " He said , " I hate my father . " Ah , look at me . How am I going to find a job looking like this ? CEJA DE FIERRO Want a cigarette ? p. 18 SHINDAGO And blow up from this oil ? No thank you . ( Starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been strapped to a plane with my tongue . DELUNA That 's worse ! SHINDAGO I 'm kidding . Any foreigners today ? I met these men from Arabia last year . They said they are coming this way , too . Then I heard that the Chinese are coming this way . I thought the Chinese were rich . CORTEZ It 's the Japanese . SHINDAGO Oh How we all desire the same thing . DELUNA Like what ? SHINDAGO A better life , menso ! You should n't be teasing an old , tired man who is in pain . ( Long moment of all characters settling in . ) MARTIN DE CABOS How much pain are you in ? SHINDAGO What ? Oh , I 'm fine . MARTIN DE CABOS But you said you were in pain . SHINDAGO I meant here in my heart . I have pain thinking about one who did n't make it . If I do something , I could jeopardize my own family One of the barrels fell off the truck . I 'm sure of it . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next part of their journey . p. 19 MARTIN DE CABOS Are you sure ? SHINDAGO They had to use a crowbar to take the lid off my barrel . If he fell out in the desert , there is nothing . There were eight of us , altogether . A mother and her two small children . Me , and four other men . I remember their eyes . DELUNA A mother , two children . Three . You and four other men . That 's eight . SHINDAGO Only seven arrived . CORTEZ Then you counted wrong . SHINDAGO No I did n't In the barrel , I was swimming in my sweat . When I came out , I was soaked . Completely wet . DELUNA Well ? Are n't you a wetback ? ( The men all laugh then the door slides open . A man with a fierce look stares at them , then cracks the warmest and largest smile , and pushes in an old suitcase . Manuel is in different clothes than in the first scene . He may have grayer hair , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always have a winning personality and a sense of fun throughout the play , even in the bad situations . ) FELICITANOS ( Joyful . ) Andale , muchachos , ayudame . DELUNA Do you smell ? FELICITANOS No , do you ? ( He jumps in before the boys help him and laughs at their attempt . ) Boy , are you guys ugly . I better go back , right now , before it rubs off on me. p. 20 DELUNA You did n't see my face ! FELICITANOS Yours is worse ! DELUNA No , I 'm cute . ( They all laugh . Sound : Train bells . ) DELUNA ( Continues . ) We 're getting ready to go . FELICITANOS I just made it in time . Lottery tickets here I come . DELUNA Did you hear that the Mexican who won the California lottery was already rich ? He did n't need the money . FELICITANOS What else is new ? The rich get richer and the poor have a sense of humor . I 'm Manuel Felicitas . And you ? CEJA DE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good journey . Who is this baby-face over there ? MARTIN DE CABOS Noel Martin de Cabos . FELICITANOS Good to meet you . How about your name , huero ? DELUNA Huero . FELICITANOS Last name then . DELUNA DeLuna . FELICITANOS DeLuna ? De la Luna . Of the moon . White as the moon . ( Laughs . ) Did your mother see a white moon when you were born ? I bet the doctor did . p. 21 DELUNA Hey , that 's my mother you 're talking about  --  FELICITANOS ( Overlapping on " talking . " ) Oh , come on Huerito . Your mother had to be white for you to come out like this . DELUNA Of course , the Spanish are white . I have roots all the way to Northern Spain . FELICITANOS We all do , but who admits it ? CEJA DE FIERRO He 's an aristocrat . DELUNA No , I 'm not . FELICITANOS Do n't worry , we forgive you . ( Manuel notices Luis and goes to him . He taps him with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this man ? Is he drunk ? CEJA DE FIERRO His name is Luis Antonio del Cruz . He 's from near my village . He is a man to be respected . CORTEZ Respected ? Why ? Look at him . CEJA DE FIERRO Because I say so . FELICITANOS Well , you all heard that . We 'll respect him in the morning . It 's morning ! CORTEZ My name is Hernando Cortez . Call me Hernan . FELICITANOS Are you an explorer ? p. 22 CORTEZ I am now . I 'll be looking for and and riches . FELICITANOS Looking for gold or spice ? CORTEZ Gold . FELICITANOS Cortez borrowed gold from the Aztecs and never returned it . CEJA DE FIERRO No wonder Mexico is so poor . FELICITANOS Cortez started the tradition . ( They all agree . ) Now that I have all your attention , and I see that you 're ready to accept me as your master of ceremonies , let me introduce my humble self to you . My name is  --  SHINDAGO Manuel Felicitas . You 're still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pepe . ( They hug . ) Is that you ? Shingado . How old you look ! And you 've changed colors . You are now black . What has life done to you ? SHINDAGO Broken every bone in my body . FELICITANOS And mine , too . But I do n't show it . Oh , the good times we had ! SHINDAGO I do n't remember any . FELICITANOS The girls . The dancing . You remember . We only danced with beautiful women . p. 23 SHINDAGO Where ? FELICITANOS How could you forget Chicago ? SHINDAGO I remember Chicago . FELICITANOS Remember when the pollacks chased me ? They beat the shit out of me . SHINDAGO Now why would they do that to a big mouth ? FELICITANOS My mouth was n't that big , then . Ah , you 're beginning to remember . SHINDAGO Well a little is coming back to me . But honestly , you had a very , big mouth . FELICITANOS But it took me places . It helped us get into the Aragon Ballroom . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all of them . I was able to kiss one , too . Then her boyfriend became very angry . I could n't help it . I 'm a Latin lover . You danced with her , too . Do n't you remember ? She was so big ! CORTEZ How big was she ? DELUNA Was she this big ? ( Huero grabs Hernan 's chest and demonstrates breasts . ) FELICITANOS More than you can handle . She had big everything . Big eyes , big lips  --  CORTEZ Big nose ? DELUNA Big feet ? p. 24 CORTEZ Big ears ? FELICITANOS No . A big  --  SHINDAGO Oh , now I remember . DELUNA A big what ? What ? SHINDAGO The boyfriend beat you up for stealing his girlfriend . You ran very fast before he got you . FELICITANOS She could n't help herself with me . SHINDAGO You have n't changed . You 're still as obnoxious as ever . FELICITANOS The women fought to dance with me . SHINDAGO They fought to get away from you . FELICITANOS The women loved my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you left . ( They all laugh . ) FELICITANOS Pepe , you have a sense of humor . SHINDAGO No sense of humor . It was the truth . FELICITANOS ( Eyes Huero 's pathetic pillowcase luggage . ) What 's in your bag ? DELUNA Sunglasses , a bathing suit , suntan lotion , toilet paper , and dice . FELICITANOS DICE ? I lost a woman with dice . She saw my number ! ( Train bells , then a big jolt . The men are thrown to the side . Pepe gets hurt from his fall . Hernan takes a look out of the boxcar. ) p. 25 CORTEZ They are reconnecting the cars . Why are they doing that ? Quiet . Someone 's coming ! ( The men hug the walls and stay very quiet . Long silence . ) ( Someone on the other side jiggles the boxcar door . Manuel takes a look then goes out . He returns later and closes the door . The door is then latched from outside . ) FELICITANOS He locked the door for our safety . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't worry . It 's all right . He will open it again when we get further along . We made it this far . We are in the United States ! ( The train jerks forward . There is commotion outside the boxcar door as the train begins to move . The men sense that something went wrong , but are unsure what . They look at each other in silence . The train sounds take over. ) p. 26 Act 1 , Scene 3 SCENE THREE Dim lights . The men are lying in pathetic positions on the boxcar floor . Luis rises from his sleep in a ghostlike manner . ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ This must be a dream . Where am I ? Am I in hell ? Where have I been taken to this time ? Oh , my God . Why are you putting me through this ? This is a torture . And these men . Who are they ? Why are they here ? Why have you asked that I remain with them ? What deed are you asking from me this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the familiar . What is your plan ? Why do you send me like John the Baptist ? I have no message . I have only confusion . I have only forced breath and no will to live . Even John the Baptist had a message . I only have fear . I only have death on my mind . I carry the pain of living . Why do you continue to push me toward life when all I know is that I should be seeing death ? ( The Aztec Skull Dancer approaches . ) ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ ( Continues . ) There . That is more like it . ( They stare at each and circle around . ) ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ ( Continues . ) What is my mission ? What is the horror that awaits me . You know that I 've been waiting for the end . Let God take it , for suicide is not in good taste . Destroying a temple is always in poor judgment . Pleading and waiting for death is more admirable when one has sinned and wishes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and true God For this is what I wait for . ( The Skull Dancer disappears . Luis then takes his place with the men. ) p. 27 ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ ( Continues . ) Then , so be it . ( Luis lies down and closes his eyes . Lights dim out. ) p. 28 Act 1 , Scene 4 SCENE FOUR Bill is resting on the ground . Roberto writes on his notepad , then reads a map . BILL ( Looks up and watches Roberto . ) What are you looking for ? MUNOZ My heritage . BILL Your heritage ? You ca n't find it . No one really can . It 's a figment of the imagination . No one really cares that far back . I have no idea where I came from . Most people , I know , do n't . MUNOZ I have an idea . BILL What 's your last name ? MUNOZ Muoz . BILL That 's where your idea came from . It 's only an idea . MUNOZ A short break , Bill . BILL What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Look at your eyes . Are n't you a little bit tired ? You do n't sleep . That 's why you 're neurotic . Sleep is sleep . An important element of life . MUNOZ I keep having these dreams . BILL Wet dreams ? MUNOZ You 're an asshole , you know that . Never mind . BILL Alright , go on . p. 29 MUNOZ I hear voices . I see places . I see faces that make me want to " tear up . " BILL See a therapist . MUNOZ This is too complicated for a therapist . The answer is within me . And I 'm too freaked out to find the key . Bill , what if we are doing something real wrong . I mean , look at who we are . BILL I know who I am . I 'm a handsome cowboy . MUNOZ I 'm serious . We got to find them . BILL Well , that 's our job . MUNOZ But maybe we should let them go . We are just playing cat and mouse . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desert where there 's no shade or water . If they see us on the road , they tie themselves under cars and drive by . They get killed hiding from us . If we were n't here , Bill , travesty would n't fall upon them . BILL That 's their problem . MUNOZ Do n't you feel anything ? BILL There 's a law about walking on someone 's land without permission . MUNOZ And that 's a rule that has been broken before . BILL Yeah . Like yesterday . MUNOZ Like 1492. p. 30 BILL 1492 ? Columbus ? MUNOZ And now , the same rule applies to the new newcomers . BILL You 're cracked . Problems have come  --  MUNOZ There 's always a need to blame problems on the people with no voice . BILL They do things , Robert . MUNOZ When I see the face of a man with calluses on his hands , I know he 's here to work . BILL It 's getting out of control . There are Haitians who want to come in , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MUNOZ How do you know ? Did you read that in the paper , or did you just guess that ? BILL You are in need of sleep , real bad I suggest you get it . Besides , this is our country and we have to take care of it , or it wo n't be any good for anyone . MUNOZ That has been said before . Take care of it , or it wo n't be good anymore . You know who said that ? The Indians . BILL ( Trying to be politically correct . ) Native Americans . MUNOZ The Indians felt a need to protect the land . They were afraid that it would n't be good anymore if the white man traversed it . They 've already proved careless by shooting all the buffalo . p. 31 BILL Yeah , so what . MUNOZ And it happened . The land became worthless . Less hunting . The beauty became permanently scarred , the  --  BILL ( Overlapping on " scarred . " ) I 'm not going to listen to this shit , Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't call me Robert anymore . It 's Roberto , my birth name . BILL Shit . MUNOZ And things have to change . BILL Lose your job why do n't you . MUNOZ I propose accommodation . Here and now . Why not cut to the chase . Spare the ones who are doing what they have to in order to survive . Hang the greedy out to dry . BILL Who are the greedy ? MUNOZ The ones who put up the wall . After the Indians were nearly annihilated . BILL Native Americans ! MUNOZ Do n't you see , the roles are reversed now . White men are the first illegals . They were doing the same thing for the same reasons . Just trying to fight hunger and improve their lives . Was it their fault they had to take the chance of going across a land that was n't theirs ? These majestic people had no concept of selling Mother Nature . You only borrowed , but some white men wanted to take . So the Indians fought to protect their borders . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But they kept coming . You are proof of that . And when they would n't stop coming , they resorted to the last possible thing . War . I pity those white families , for they were only looking for a better life . What 's wrong with that ? What else was there to do ? So they fought the Indians , probably screaming , " I HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE ! " And they won . Do n't you see , Bill ? History is repeating itself .

MARTIN DE CABOS It depends on the style , the comfort and the poise . He can dress like that , and if he is content , and feels comfortable , he does look like an American . FELICITANOS ( Sarcastic . ) How profound . CORTEZ He 's right . DELUNA I 've been dressed like this all my life . So maybe I 'm Americano at heart and going to the right place .

CORTEZ He would take off his pants and hold it above his head and  --  DELUNA Oh , a partial wetback . CORTEZ Please Well , he did this for years . DELUNA We can relate to that story , but how boring . CORTEZ Here is where it 's different . One day he was caught . La migra looked up his record , and right there in the computer , right there in the screen , they found out he was an American citizen ! He just assumed he was like us , crossing back and forth when needed . DELUNA Ah , come on ! Why did n't his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , then ? CORTEZ He was a stepfather . How would he know ? DELUNA Ah , what an unbelievable story . CORTEZ It happened ! It might be a story about you , if you did n't know your beginnings . p. 37 DELUNA Never !

ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ Look at these men . Optimistic , are n't they ? Maybe not this one . ( Motions to Francisco . ) Are n't you glad you are not one of them ? Yes , I know you 've read the papers and the excesses has become a blur to you now . You say , " We all have problems . " Sure . And if you have even bigger problems than these men , my sentiments are with you . And do accept my apology for bringing the matter up . Then just look briefly , and redirect your attention to your more important issues . It 's you right . ( Motions to Noel . ) This one here . See him ? Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play dice as Noel watches and then joins in . ) ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ You 've seen them clear your table . You 've heard them laughing in the kitchens . You 've seen them wait in the corners for work . Even selling oranges in parking lots . They want to be like you . If you think real hard , you 'll notice that this situation is bad for you , too . And like everything , you wo n't notice until it 's too late . There will be complaints , panel discussions , research , but it will all be too late Much sadness makes the world go ' round .

If I think of how I hurt , I 'll hurt more . It only becomes a waste of time . ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ Then I 'm sorry . CEJA DE FIERRO What good can come of it ? If it is a confession you want , that is impossible . No more confessions . When I was born I was forced to confess . My mother walked in labor from Mexico to the United States to give me a better life . For the effort , she died in her own blood . For this I had to confess to her mother . She never forgave me for killing her daughter . I was just a newborn . And all for what ? An old woman found me next to my dead mother . She took me to my mother 's family back across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby in the cold until I was picked up by the American authorities and given citizenship ? That 's what my mother died for . p. 40 ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ Then you would n't have suffered ? CEJA DE FIERRO I would have suffered , but not so much . CORTEZ This is lame ! Why would you prefer to be raised in the United States ? Human life is n't appreciated . At the border , when a hungry family is crossing the highway , people run over them on purpose , to prevent them from arriving ! ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ Do you want to speak ? CORTEZ We all know about this . ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ Then why have you come forward ? CORTEZ Out of necessity . ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ This is a dream , Hernan . Go on . CORTEZ Why should I ? ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ To relieve the tension . CORTEZ But it never leaves me . SHINDAGO Nor me . CEJA DE FIERRO Luis , you 're up to your old tricks again . Look what you are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is but one of you who wants to relieve anguish , then speak now . CORTEZ I can understand the Americans not wanting us to come . But my own people behave the same way . Why do they resent us in sharing what they already have ? p. 41 CEJA DE FIERRO They 're not your own people . They are wearing an American suit . CORTEZ And one is my own cousin . He does n't speak Spanish , but he does communicate his hate to me . While I visited my uncle and aunt , he took me to a field near the border . His friends were dressed like Rambo . They rounded crossers and verbally tortured them . They threatened them with " la migra . " An old man had tears in his eyes as they pushed him to the ground . He feared the border patrol , but what a hell to be treated like an animal by an American teenager That 's it . I ca n't speak anymore . ( Hernan goes to the corner of the boxcar .

MARTIN DE CABOS There 's no beer in your hand . FELICITANOS Oh my God ! Who took my beer ? Well , that 's life , is n't it . Pepe , you buy me a beer later . SHINDAGO Get a job . FELICITANOS I will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe . FELICITANOS Ah , maybe me too . SHINDAGO If I remember correctly , the women worked harder in the fields than you . FELICITANOS You remember only certain things . I 'll work making mattresses . Making someone else comfortable is a pleasure for me. p. 43 MARTIN DE CABOS What other jobs are available ? FELICITANOS Many . You find two or three to make enough money . When Pepe was stronger , he worked in the fields . Then in the evenings he would work in the restaurant cleaning tables . SHINDAGO What do you want me to do ? I had eight kids to feed . FELICITANOS You should have stopped porking her . SHINDAGO Shut up . FELICITANOS Let 's dance . Get up and dance with me you old man . DELUNA I 'll dance with you , but you better not call me a queer . FELICITANOS Huerito , you 're a joker like me . I 'll give you one advice that has been a blessing to me . Get a woman who will laugh at your jokes . Because no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . But do n't get a wife like Pepe . SHINDAGO My family is important to me . It 's all I have that matters . I would n't be here if they did n't matter . FELICITANOS It 's unfortunate that we leave the only thing that does matter . If we bring our children here , they turn into Chicanos . Hijo , they are worse than gringos . ( Manuel continues teasing Pepe . Hernan walks away and sits in a corner. ) p. 44 DELUNA What 's the matter with you ? CORTEZ I think it 's the heat . DELUNA It 's not that bad . CORTEZ Why has the train been going so slow ? Look at how wet my hair is from the sweat . DELUNA At least you hair is n't purple and sticking up . That 's how my hair was last year . I was trying to look American , but then , no one wanted to give me a job . And I 'm a man who does anything to get a job . I have to . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said I can stop when I get married and have to provide for my own . CORTEZ When are you planning to get married ?

The occupants only sense the Skull Dancer . Suddenly the mood gets very dark . ) DELUNA ( Continues . ) What 's the matter ? CORTEZ You know , I 've crossed three times , but after the first , I quit for a long while . p. 45 DELUNA Where did you cross ? CORTEZ I crossed at the Texas border . DELUNA Me , too . CORTEZ And I got the shit beat out of me there . DELUNA Oh , not me . CORTEZ And that is why I stopped . I was very confused after that . They were people like me who did it . DELUNA Waddas ? CORTEZ Sons or grandsons of waddas . Latinos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People who were born here . Manuel is right . When you have children in the in the United States , something happens to them . DELUNA But why beat you up ? CEJA DE FIERRO Maybe they were just warning you , or just getting you used to what you should expect in the United States . FELICITANOS You all are too negative . ( To Noel . ) Innocent one . Stop listening to these men . They are filling you with lies . I always return to my family with pockets lined with money . I then buy them clothes , shoes , toys , whatever . I feel like a real man , until the money runs out . Of course , this was n't my life in the old days . I was a butcher in my own shop . My wife would visit me every afternoon with a basket of bread and fruit . ( Pause . ) She was so beautiful . p. 46 SHINDAGO She 's ugly now ? FELICITANOS I wish she was .

There is nothing . p. 63 MARTIN DE CABOS Look again . DELUNA All right . ( Huero examines the ceiling . Then he holds out his arm as if he was holding on to a torch . ) DELUNA ( Continues . ) Look , I 'm the statue of liberty . MARTIN DE CABOS Stop it ! Be serious . DELUNA You sound like my mother . We have to liven things up , Noel . What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look . DELUNA What if I say no ? ( They start shoving each other . Manuel stops them . ) FELICITANOS Relax . El coyote will come . I know he will . The coyote has never failed me . He gets me across each time , with few problems . And each time I make money and go home to my wife and children . CEJA DE FIERRO A su India . FELICITANOS Si , mi India . My beautiful Indian wife with the soft eyes and hair . Long eyelashes to match her silky straight hair . She 's from the mountains . One of the few places the Spaniards missed . She is pure Indian , and I love her very much . She speaks very quietly , but she laughs loudly . She even says some ancient words of her ancestors . I ask her if she is speaking Nahuatl , the language of the Aztecs , but she smiles shyly . Her words are not from the Aztecs . They are of another language . Even the best anthropologists can not truly decipher the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She is good to me and I am good to her except when I leave . p. 64 CEJA DE FIERRO How did you marry a true India if they are forbidden from mixing ? FELICITANOS Her family saw how happy we both were together . They 'd come from the mountains to sell goods on Sunday . I worked in a shop next to the mercado . After witnessing our great affection for one another , they finally told her to go with me . But it would mean that she can never go back . It was a tearful , yet happy event . Her family was supposed to kill her for going off with me . This is customary when the indigenous falls in love with an intruder . They are trying to save what 's left of their race . Instead , they told everyone she fell from a high cliff . They even conducted a funeral at the ledge where they said she fell . We watched from across the valley . There was a procession , then the funeral . We imagined it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time . They left after throwing flowers over the cliff . We then kissed and walked to our future . ( Long silence . ) FELICITANOS Well , let 's sit quietly to conserve the air . SHINDAGO Compadre . I feel terrible . FELICITANOS You 'll be fine . CORTEZ It 's been eight hours . SHINDAGO Eight were in the barrels . Should I have gone to find him ? p. 65 MARTIN DE CABOS I do n't know . SHINDAGO He 's in the desert . He 's there . FELICITANOS You 're wrong . He got out . SHINDAGO He 's dying in a can . Suffocating . FELICITANOS He 's fine . You are fine . We all will be fine if we wait quietly . That 's the trick . To wait quietly . Come on , do n't be babies . What happened to the jobs ? Eh ? I thought you all wanted jobs . DELUNA Of course , we do . FELICITANOS Then relax . Hernan , so much work in the United States . CORTEZ That 's why I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ? SHINDAGO Maybe at this time , we should confess our sins . FELICITANOS No . If we do that , we 'll be knocking on the door of death . I forbid you all from talking to the devil . SHINDAGO I think we should reflect on our live . So you can leave with a certain amount of peace . The questions you 've carried all your life gets answered the moment before you die . FELICITANOS Reflect yourself . CEJA DE FIERRO We 're going to suffer the same fate as those Salvadorians. p. 66 MARTIN DE CABOS The Salvadorians ? FELICITANOS ( Pissed . ) Let one stay innocent . CEJA DE FIERRO They walked in a line , holding everything they owned . The journey was long . They kept going until they found themselves nowhere . FELICITANOS No ! CEJA DE FIERRO Then , we try again . ( Motions to Huero to assist . ) DELUNA We are locked in from the outside . FELICITANOS We wait a little longer . CEJA DE FIERRO We can not sit here doing nothing . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight for life . DELUNA Maybe the coyote was held up somewhere . What was the plan ? FELICITANOS The plan was to hide us in here . Then when we passed the hills he meets us and unlocks the door . MARTIN DE CABOS Then where is he ? FELICITANOS I do n't know . MARTIN DE CABOS It 's driving me crazy to be here . SHINDAGO ( Delirious and looking at Noel . ) I used to have a face like him . p. 67 FELICITANOS No , you did n't . SHINDAGO Yes , I did . The face of innocence . It was at the very first time I came across . Oh , how lonely I was . I cried for my mother . I cried for my father . I cried for all my brothers . And I cried for Mexico , because of the state it was in . I came looking for the utopia . That 's what they told me was here . Then , I saw my first Americans . They did n't live in big houses . They did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tickets . It scared me to see them at the mission waiting for food . I could n't get into the line . I just could n't . I did n't come for that . I did n't care if I was starving , I just could n't get into the line . I came because of the good stories . The good jobs . But no one told me the other side of the story . I saw these Americans wandering around poor and hungry . Carrying all their possessions in a push cart . And I thought , son Americans . If they 're like this , then , what 's going to happen to us ? CEJA DE FIERRO Nothing , absolutely nothing . MARTIN DE CABOS No ! You say things I would never believe  --  CEJA DE FIERRO Who 's going to tell you the truth ? MARTIN DE CABOS I heard  --  SHINDAGO We heard , too . MARTIN DE CABOS I was hoping  --  p. 68 CEJA DE FIERRO That things would be different for you ? Maybe . MARTIN DE CABOS What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what you want to see . That 's being American . DELUNA That 's why you came . To become an " American " like your school friends . MARTIN DE CABOS No . I did n't come for that . I did n't come for that . ( Bill , Abuelita , the Skull Dancer and Roberto are in different lights in the background . ) CORTEZ ( Overlapping on " you . " ) Then why did you come ? BILL ( Overlapping on " you . " ) Then why did you come ? ABUELITA ( Overlapping on " you . " ) Then why did you come ? MUNOZ ( Overlapping on " you . " ) Then why did you come ? ( Lights on Noel and the Skull Dancer . ) MARTIN DE CABOS I was in grave danger . You know the conditions in El Salvador . The problems , the war . The many innocent people that are killed . My father was a newspaper man . When he knew something , he wrote about it . He wrote it even with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involvement in the disappearances , and the violations of human rights , and he wrote it . He wrote it all . He had to tell the people . He had to let the world know . Then , a bomb in the editor 's office ended his life . And that was it . I tried to find out who took my father away from me . I searched all his possessions , for some information . That was when I started being followed . My mother decided I had to leave before they took my life , as well . You see , she felt I was too young to get involved in the politics of the country . I am only sixteen , but I am big for my age . Do n't you agree ? ( The Skull Dancer nods his head yes. ) p. 69 MARTIN DE CABOS ( Continues . ) Then are you going to spare me ? I am only sixteen . ( Blackout. ) p. 70 Act 2 , Scene 3 SCENE THREE In the blackout , Roberto enters from the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face . His face is painted to resemble a skull . MUNOZ ( Not himself . ) I found you . I found you hiding . Where do you think you 're going ? You 're going nowhere , buddy . You know you 're going nowhere . I do n't even have to tell you . You already know Do n't hide in there . Do n't change your clothes , your voice , or that look in your eyes . I know who you are . You are a goddamn Mexican . That 's right . One of those stinking beaners that try so hard to fit in . To get part of the American pie . Well , there 's none for you . No matter how hard you try . Someone is going to get you . Someone is going to find out who you are , and remind you , " You 're nothin . " DO YOU HEAR ME , BOY ! ? FIGHT FOR YOUR COUNTRY . GET TO THE JUNGLES AND FIGHT LIKE A MAN . YOU 'RE AN AMERICAN ! NOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't call yourself a LATINO ! You 're not a Roman , either . You 're an American . That 's what your parents wanted That 's what your grandfather wanted . ( Roberto turns around and searches behind him . Losing it . ) I know what you 're doing to me . I know what you 're doing to me . ( Roberto turns the flashlight toward the audience , then turns if off . Sound : Coyote howl. ) p. 71 Act 2 , Scene 4 SCENE FOUR Temperature one hundred and twenty-three degrees . Twelve hours later . Huero and Hernan play a quiet game of dice . Pepe is near them with his eyes closed . CORTEZ Te gane . ( Huero has no more money to play . He then reaches over to the sleeping Pepe 's pocket . As he gestures that he is only going to borrow some cash , Pepe grabs his hand . ) SHINDAGO If I was younger , I would kick the shit out of you . Here ! Take it and know you took an old man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lunch . He gave it to me . SHINDAGO You took an old man 's lunch to gamble . Admit it . DELUNA Admit it ? If I do , can I keep the money as a gift ? SHINDAGO Crafty son of a bitch . DELUNA I 'm playing . I 'll win it all back and I 'll pay you with interest . SHINDAGO Are n't you sick of gambling ? DELUNA We 're doing it to pass the time , viejo . Play with us , then . SHINDAGO If you lose it , you pay me back when you get your dish-washing job . p. 72 DELUNA I 've done that . SHINDAGO I bet you have . DELUNA It 's not that bad . It 's like heaven . The dish soap are like clouds . The waitresses that drift by are angels . I 'm in heaven with water all over me . The front of my shirt gets completely wet . I become a wet-front Noel , we need more players . Let Hernan and me take your money . SHINDAGO Just take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather not play . DELUNA Suit yourself . MARTIN DE CABOS ( Long pause . ) You do nothing but watch us . It 's making some of us nervous . Sleep again , Padre . ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ I dream too much when I do . I start to see things I do n't want to see . Then I tell myself what will happen will happen . MARTIN DE CABOS Is being fatalistic a trait of the priesthood ? ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ Yes . It 's the best thing I learned . MARTIN DE CABOS Even your own humor does n't amuse you . What made you leave the church ? ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ My advice is to sit , and wait for whatever . p. 73 MARTIN DE CABOS I am sitting . And I am waiting . And I 'm beginning to see what will happen . Yet , I still have questions in my mind and believe it or not , I still have hope . So I sit here with my hope , and I go back in my mind and remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have implied that I have been idealistic , and nave . But being here and watching all of you , I feel I 've grown . But what of it now ? Will I be able to exercise what I 've learned ? We 've tried several times to get out and each time the fear grips us more , and the temperature rises . Then I sit here and think of all my sins and I am saddened that I do n't have enough to occupy my time . So I think of what you all have said , and I have questions . ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ What questions do you have ? MARTIN DE CABOS First , what happened to those people ? ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ The Salvadorians ? MARTIN DE CABOS Yes . They 're from my country , I should know . ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ You are much too young to know about it . MARTIN DE CABOS Have n't you heard what I said ? I 've aged in here . This box is taking away my youth . I left El Salvador @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Too late , is n't it . For a sixteen-year-old , I 've lived in grave danger without realizing it . p. 74 CEJA DE FIERRO So do we . MARTIN DE CABOS I was almost killed . CEJA DE FIERRO When I was born , I was almost killed . MARTIN DE CABOS They were after me in San Salvador where I lived . CEJA DE FIERRO Who 's after you ? MARTIN DE CABOS The government . CEJA DE FIERRO What did you do ? Get bad grades ? MARTIN DE CABOS NO ! CEJA DE FIERRO Well , relax . They wo n't find you now . You 're stuck in a boxcar . ( Noel goes to the door again and hits the door . ) SHINDAGO I 'm very thirsty . FELICITANOS You 've been thirsty before . SHINDAGO Not like this . FELICITANOS It wo n't be long now . The cerveza is coming real soon . We 'll be dancing in Chicago before you know it . SHINDAGO That 's good . ( Dry heaving cough , then stares at Manuel . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started rather suddenly , remember ? Maybe he got into an accident and could n't reach us. p. 75 DELUNA ( Annoyed with Luis ' staring . ) Stop looking at me ! In my town , you are scum for falling away from Christ . ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ I 'm still a believer . DELUNA Not in my family . ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ Where is your sister ? DELUNA Sister ? Which one ? The pretty one , or the not-so-pretty one ? ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ She looks like you , does n't she ? DELUNA Ah , then it is the pretty one . ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ She has two moles on her cheek , very close together . She 's very beautiful . DELUNA How did you know ? ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ When did you see her last ? DELUNA She 's in San Fernando . A town in California . ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ She is ? DELUNA Yes , she is . ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ When did you last see her ? DELUNA She is with some very bad people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even know me until we got here . How can you say you saw her ? p. 76 ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ I 'm just passing the time telling you what I believe . As you play with dice , I go into my mind , and recall faces . One face in particular had the resemblance of you . The instant I saw you , I knew it . And that was when my blood curdled once again . I am going to tell you where and when , and you can decide what you want to believe . DELUNA Then go on . ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ Not only is she extremely lovely , they can use her American looks . To save time the officials wave people across the border glancing briefly at their identification cards . They only stop the darker ones I thin they have her against her will . But hunger keeps you against your will . If she was allowed to cross on credit , then they are making her pay the debt by working for them . She has blue eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like you were going to cry . That 's when I was able to see the resemblance even more . DELUNA I was n't going to cry ! Everyone has a sister ! Leave me alone ! CORTEZ Where is she , then ? DELUNA I do n't know . She stopped writing . I want to find her . A man came to our door and told us she 's safe , but did n't tell us where she is . He said it would open her to deportation . CORTEZ Who came to you ? p. 77 DELUNA A stranger . ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ A stranger that was the devil himself . DELUNA Callete . ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ She has the same eyes , lips , and  --  ( Huero grabs Luis and tosses him about . The others are too tired and hot to react this time . ) DELUNA WHERE DID YOU SEE HER ? TELL ME ! ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ A beautiful child . So quiet . So lifeless in your sister 's arms . It was a very dark child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to her . She was already trembling with fear . She turned so fast that the baby fell . The bundle rolled open and I stooped over to pick it up . I looked , full of wonder , expecting the baby to cry . The baby did n't cry . It did n't bleed . It did n't move . La huera motioned me to return it to her . She pleaded with her eyes for me to remain silent . We were being watched . She then walked away . I stood there , ready to die . I knew that the huera was dying , too . DELUNA You 're wrong ! You hallucinate ! ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ She was forced to be a mule . ( Huero slaps Luis . ) DELUNA NO ! No , she would never smuggle drugs . And never like that ! Hernan , he 's crazy , right ? Why is he saying this to me ? Tell me where you saw her ? See ! You never saw her ! p. 78 CEJA DE FIERRO Sometimes the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lords can convince them easily for they are watching their families starve . They know it 's wrong and may end up in prison , but they have to take the chance The money is too good and the job so simple . Strap the drugs to your body and go one mile . But in this case , carry it in a bundle . This is a cruel world . ( Huero goes and hides his head . A sick stillness in the boxcar . ) MARTIN DE CABOS I do n't understand . CORTEZ You do n't want to understand . MARTIN DE CABOS What does this all mean ? If I am going to die , I want to know all that I can in my last few hours . Tell me about the blue baby . Tell me about the Salvadorians . Only then will I be happy . CORTEZ You want to know misery in order to be happy ? MARTIN DE CABOS Apparently , that 's all everyone knows here . CORTEZ There is joy . Do n't mistaken us Mexicans for only talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , then eventually , with some effort , we forget it . That is what we must do before a small remnant of joy comes . MARTIN DE CABOS You 're all trapped in misery . p. 79 CORTEZ Maybe we are . And looking around in here , I see that you are totally right . MARTIN DE CABOS Then cleanse may soul and tell me what I need to know . Tell me everything you can think of . Take me to the corner and talk to me until I can no longer hear . Tell me about what Luis saw . I want to know . CORTEZ Do n't put that burden on me . MARTIN DE CABOS I want to know . CORTEZ ( Hesitates . ) I heard that babies . I just heard it once , Noel . MARTIN DE CABOS Tell me . CORTEZ I heard that babies were stolen from their mothers and made into mules . They cut the babies open and gut them like fish . Then wrap cocaine in bags and stuff it inside their bellies . Hueras would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the babies turn blue . I heard it once . Just once . It ca n't be true . MARTIN DE CABOS No . ( Silence . Everyone looks at each other . Francisco starts carving at the floor with a belt buckle . ) ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ I was a priest in Francisco 's village . That 's where I began my work . I did n't last long . I was missing one important ingredient of my priesthood education . I did n't understand them . I was too Spanish and ignorant to know the indigenous people . My family has less Indian . My heritage is more Spanish . More European They enjoyed their ancestral ideas . The Spanish priests before me had better luck . They resorted to paintings of a fiery hell to scare them into believing . I did n't want to do that . I just wanted to love them . Funny how faith and the stomach are connected . Hunger devours the faithful , and believing stops . When I caught a parishioner kneeling before a collection box , crossing himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were finished . ( Cross fade. ) p. 80 p. 81 Act 2 , Scene 5 SCENE FIVE Roberto stares at the Skull Dancer . He then directs each line to him . In a choreographed response , the Skull Dancer reacts to the lines . MUNOZ I 've picked you up at the factories . I 've picked you up in the fields . You 're hiding from me because you want to keep your job . Sometimes you embarrass me . Let them walk all over you ! Stand up ! Stupid waiter . Stupid cook . Goddamn custodian . Maid ! Then I admire you because you are so fucken humble . The dedication to an endless job and the limited dollar . ( Sarcastic . ) God bless America Yeah , right . ( The Skull Dancer approaches with a torch and swings it around . He then stares at Roberto . ) MUNOZ ( Continues . ) Go ahead , spit on my face , man . Well ! What do you expect ? ! Stop coming ! ! ! ( Roberto puts a red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Low Rider , a sub-culture of the Chicano movement of the 60s . He and the Skull Dancer move forward in unison . The two have the same affectation for the next lines . ) MUNOZ ( Chicano-like . Almost schizoid . ) Stop finding ways to hide from me , fulano . Stop giving the damn coyote your money so he can entice you with the enticement of the American employer . I found you underneath a car . You were tied under the motor . Nice skin graft . Once you were stuck in a freezer of a damn camper . Do n't you know you are hot-blooded ? Como eres , ese . Shit life . You know what I mean ? Where are you today , eh , Mickey ? Where are you , flaco ? It 's going to be a hundred-and-fuck . Tell me where you 're at , Chapulin ! You , from the jungles of Yucatan ! Do n't you know there 's a desert between you and the jobs ? ! Horale . Hey , Goofy . Come and give me five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Grandmother crosses . Robert sees her. ) p. 82 MUNOZ Abuelita ? Abuelita ! ( Roberto breaks down . He takes off the bandana . ) Aye , abuela mia . ABUELITA Que te pasa hijo ? MUNOZ I 'm losing it . ABUELITA No , mijo . Are you hungry , mijo ? MUNOZ I 'm scared . ABUELITA Scared of what ? MUNOZ Of what I am doing . ABUELITA What are you doing , Roberto ? MUNOZ Losing your respect . ABUELITA But you are " mi nieto . " My wonderful grandson . You love me . You would never lose respect for me , nor I of you . MUNOZ If you only knew what I was doing . ABUELITA What are you doing ? MUNOZ I 've been killing you . ( The Border Patrol Officer with no face points a gun to her head . ) MUNOZ RUN FROM ME , ABUELITA ! ABUELITA I ca n't run from you . If I do , I 'll be like the hungry farmer . MUNOZ Run ! ABUELITA He was so hungry , Roberto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , run from me ! ABUELITA ( To the faceless Border Patrol Officer . ) If a grandmother can not tell stories , then what good is she ? Allow me one story , devil . ( The faceless Border Patrol Officer puts down his gun . ) ABUELITA The drought was terrible this time . This farmer 's crops died . All he could do was gather herbs and sell them to the local pharmacist . Sometimes a curandero would buy it . Not at a very good price , but it was good to sell it to him . For someday he may make a potion for you with the very herbs you gave him . That would guarantee a cure . Other times the farmer would cut tunas from the cactus miles away and sell them in the street corners . The only competition were the desert turtles . Their jaws were stained red from the sweet meals of the cactus fruit . MUNOZ I have to kill you . ABUELITA He would then bring the tunas to town in a basket and stand on a street corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow tunas in descending color . He made beautiful towers from them . Tourist would come and take pictures . Everyone was saying how rich these people were . For even the children had cameras around their necks . They said they lived like kings and queens in their country . The farmer decided to go to this place of the kings . He said that before sun up , he was going to see the king . At dawn he went to the airport . He found the section behind the airplane wheels . He hid there . The plane went up , but as the wheels folded behind , he was crushed . The pilot had to readjust the wheels . The farmer then fell out . He was later found in the cactus patch , near many tunas . The turtles nibbling his body . ( Abuelita looks at Roberto , sadly . Long silence. ) p. 84 MUNOZ Do n't look at me like that . Do n't look at me that way ! Do n't you understand ? IT 'S MY JOB DO N'T YOU UNDERSTAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the faceless Border Patrol Officer begins to shoot . Blackout seconds before gunshot . Gun blaze seen in the darkness . Then a dim light showing the Skull Dancer 's reaction at being shot . Blue blood drips from the wound . It then turns white , then red . He then looks at Roberto . Slow Blackout. ) p. 85 Act 2 , Scene 6 SCENE SIX Temperature one hundred and forty-two degrees . Incredible heat . Manuel drips the few remaining drops of water into his mouth . He throws the bottle down . FELICITANOS Que me lleva la trampa . ( Pepe coughs heavily . Luis goes to him and starts to pray . Manuel shoves Luis . ) FELICITANOS No prayers until I say so . The instructions are to wait . CEJA DE FIERRO Look what your " coyote " has done to us . FELICITANOS How do you expect to get here without his help ? Maybe his other idea would 've been better ! Strapping us on to the birds that fly north . That would have worked . Right , Pepe ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " There is no bird big enough for you . " Say it Pepe . SAY IT Pepe . ANTONIO DE LA CRUZ There is no bird big enough for you . FELICITANOS Good . Now everyone , gather around . Let me tell you about the time I was in New York City . I worked as a window washer in one of the tallest buildings . I was very afraid of heights and  --  ( Pepe coughs heavily and hoarsely . ) FELICITANOS ( Continues . ) Stop that . Stop that , I say ! ( Pepe tries to stop himself. ) p. 86 FELICITANOS ( Continues . ) I did everything and hated it , but I had to work . I worked for my family . A man works for his family . A MAN MUST WORK FOR HIS FAMILY , ANYWHERE . ( Manuel kicks Huero . ) FELICITANOS ( Continues . ) Get up . I said get up . ( Huero gets up weakly . ) FELICITANOS ( Continues . ) There , now lets sing a song to entertain these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Huero is about to fall in exhaustion . ) FELICITANOS ( Continues . ) I did n't say dance , I said sing . ( Huero falls to his knees . Manuel holds Huero 's right shoulder to keep him from falling over . ) FELICITANOS ( Continues . ) I know a song made famous by Pedro Infante in the early 40s . Have you heard of him ? It goes like this . ( There is a moment of strength as he begins to sing the following . The rest of the men have empty looks . On his knees , Huero sverves to the rhythm of the song . Song available on Linda Ronstadt 's Album " Canciones De Mi Padre . " ) FELICITANOS ( Sings . ) Han nacido en mi rancho dos arbolitos , ( Translation . ) Two little trees have been born on my ranch.Dos arbolitos que parecen gemelos , Two little trees that look like twinsY desde me casita los veo solitosAnd from my house I see them all alone.Bajo el amparo santo y la luz del cielo.Under the holy protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are never separated , one from the otherPorque asi quiso Dios que los dos nacieran , Because that is how God wanted for the two of them to be born , Y con sus mismas ramas se hacen cariciasComo si fueran novios que se quisieran.And with their own branches they caress each otherAsk if they were sweethearts who loved each other Arbolito , arbolito , bajo tu sombraLittle tree , little tree , under you shadeVoy a esperar que el dia cansado muera , I 'm going to wait until the end of this tiring dayY cuando estoy solito mirando al cieloAnd when I 'm all alone looking to the skyPido pa'que me mande una compaeraI 'm going to ask Heaven to send me a companionArbolito , arbolito , me siento soloLittle tree , little tree , I feel aloneQuiero que me acompaes hasta que muera.I want you to accompany me until I die . ( Huero drops to the ground . Manuel then walks away humming . The Skull Dancer approaches wearing a sombrero . He has a hole in his chest. ) p. 87 FELICITANOS ( To the Skull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked the tree to accompany me until I died . I did n't ask for you to accompany me . Do you have a cigarette ? ( The Skull Dancer offers a cigarette to Manuel and lights it for him . He then lights a cigarette for himself . They sit there calmly , smoking , occasionally looking around . ) FELICITANOS ( Continues . ) I suppose it 's almost time . Is that why you are here ? I thought so . Did you like my song ? Well , I did my best . I always did my best . ( Long pause . Manuel gets determined . ) You know something ? I 'm going to fight you . So you better go away before I kick your ass . ( The Skull Dancer exits . ) FELICITANOS ( Continues . ) MI ARBOLITOS ARE WAITING FOR ME ! Get up all of you ! If you lie there , you are asking for death to come to your door ! You with the university education , I have an education . I do . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . See Noel , we are university students . We are the ones with the education and our education tells us to relax and wait with our eyes open . Keep them open to avoid the dancing devil of death . ( He steps on the dice . ) FELICITANOS ( Continues . ) Get rid of those dice ! p. 88 CEJA DE FIERRO We 've taken a big chance and lost . FELICITANOS We have n't lost yet ! CEJA DE FIERRO I only detest that we gambled with our lives . MARTIN DE CABOS ( Feeling the hysteria . ) I should have crossed on foot ! CEJA DE FIERRO I used to cross on foot . I walked to any town that was willing to hire me . I 'd do anything for whatever they paid me . I know that there are many who take those same paths . I 've seen them . The path has widened . I 'll stop to talk if they are carrying their own water . If not , I pass them by quickly . MARTIN DE CABOS Why would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want them to see in my eyes , their death . FELICITANOS You see , they should 've had coyotes ! To tell them the right way ! CEJA DE FIERRO THEY HAD A COYOTE . FELICITANOS Look , now you 're scaring the boy ! The truth is , it takes time ! CEJA DE FIERRO We do n't have time ! FELICITANOS Why are you scaring him ? ! CEJA DE FIERRO Look at his face ! He 's just a boy ! p. 89 FELICITANOS I used to have face like that ! SHINDAGO No you did n't . Manuel , he 's making more sense . Francisco , what do you want us to do ? CEJA DE FIERRO We use the rest of our energy , whatever is left , to scratch our way out . Or we 'll end up like those Salvadorians . FELICITANOS We should sit and remain quiet . He will open that door . Trust me ! CEJA DE FIERRO He said it was one mile of a walk through the desert to the farms . It turned out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FELICITANOS What are you talking about ? We have enough water . ( The men shake their heads " no . " ) CEJA DE FIERRO Thanks to the border patrol who pick up bodies before the buzzards get to them . Oh , how they suffered . They drank their urine to survive . Later , they took their own lives by cutting their throats with the stem of a belt buckle . Out of the thirty , there were only two that survived . They were the ones who slit their own throats improperly . FELICITANOS We did n't have to walk through the desert . We rode . CEJA DE FIERRO We 're not riding now !
