Chapter One " Right , so where are all the good-looking men in formfitting tights ? " " Probably rehearsing . You can set that down next to the cooler . " " Rehearsing ? Rehearsing what ? Hunky men in skintight clothing do n't rehearse ! They 're far too manly for such a sissy thing . Actors rehearse . Men in tights ... well , they just do n't . Unless ... hey ! You would n't drag me out here to the middle of nowhere by promising me really handsome , dashing guys in extremely cool knight getup without telling me they were all gay , would you ? " CJ grinned as I deposited a box of toilet paper , napkins , and assorted towels on top of the red plastic cooler . " I 'm sure some are , but not all . Do n't worry ; you 'll have lots of manly-man guys to slobber over . " " I 'd better , " I muttered darkly as I stomped off to the car to fetch another load of camping accessories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking lot . " You know , I always imagined ye old days of medieval yore had a whole lot more dashing , daring knights hanging around , and fewer steaming piles of poop . " I stepped carefully over the huge pile of fly-bespecked horse manure , and staggered toward the ever-growing collection of bags , boxes , coolers , food hampers , and suitcases that contained those items my cousin deemed vitalto our continued existence . " Oh , no , poop was everywhere back then . Open sewers , you know , " CJ answered from where she was on her knees digging into a rucksack , muttering to herself as I dropped a box of canned beans and packages of freeze-dried hiking food next to her . " I still have n't seen even one man in tights . There 's a couple of women a few tents down who are dressed like knights , but that 's it . So help me , Ceej , if you dragged me out here on false pretenses ... " " I did n't ! " CJ all but climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to placate me . " They 're rehearsing , I promise . Everyone rehearses before opening day . The vendors are probably vendoring or setting up their booths . And the jousters are doing practice runs . " " Okay , but I 'd better start seeing some soon . You promised me great big herds of manly guys being knights and rogues and swashbuckling pirates . " I peered around at the sea of tents that surrounded us . The flat , open field adjacent to the fairgrounds housing the Faire served as a tent city of Faire performers , vendors , employees , and joust participants . Most of the tents were blocky squares and rectangles of dull gray or green , like the one CJ had provided for us , but at the far end of the tent city were clustered beautiful striped tents of all colors , some with pennons and flags bearing coats of arms waving lazily in the late afternoon summer breeze . Other than the two women I 'd seen coming from the car , the tent city was strangely devoid of human life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manly knights , much less a herd of them . In fact , there does n't seem to be anyone here at all . Are you sure that this Faire is a hotbed of romance and dishy guys ? " " Would I lie to you ? " CJ pulled herself out of her rucksack , a smile lighting her happy gray eyes . " I personally know of six couples who met because of the Faire in the last two years , and they 're all happily married . So do n't worry ; there are oodles of manly knights here , all of them dashing and daring and wildly romantic , just like my lamb . " I rolled my eyes as I started back toward the car , located a hot , sweaty half mile away in a distant field . " Oh , yeah , your lamb , the man known to everyone as the Butcher of Birmingham . I said I wanted a modern-day personification of knightliness , Ceej , a man who 's not afraid to laugh triumphantly in the face of death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who scares the crap out of anyone who gets a good close look at him . I 'll go get the last of the stuff . If I 'm not back in half an hour , find the bravest , handsomest jouster you can and send him after me . Maybe you 'd better make it two . I 'm feeling like I 'll need a lot of resuscitating . " CJ waved an acknowledging hand at me as she dug through the canvas bag . " Right . After you get back you can slip into the garb I brought for you . " I sighed a sigh of the soon to be martyred , and staggered off toward the car . By the time I collected the last items , locked up CJ 's VW Beetle , and returned to our tent , sweat was rolling down my back , soaking the light gauze shirt I 'd put on before we left my aunt and uncle 's house in London-the town midway between Detroit and Toronto , not the English capital . " Whew ! " I set down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cans of premium cat food , bottled water , three different kinds of cat treats , a bag of dried catnip , assorted cat toys , and one huge domed litter box with infrared beams and automatic clump removal . " Criminy dutch , the things this cat ... Moth ! Come back here ; that is n't yours ! Ceej ! " My cousin CJ looked up at my whine . " Hmm ? " " Your parents ' cat is eating someone 's tent . " I pointed at the huge white cat with four orange stockings that was gnawing on the black canvas tent set up next to ours . " Oh . Probably is n't best that you let him do that . He 'll just puke it up later . I wonder where I put my side-lacing bodice ? " Ceej walked on her knees over to where three suitcases were stacked neatly in front of the humongous pea-green tent it had taken us a half hour of sweating ( and swearing ) to erect . " Me ? He 's not my responsibility anymore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one piece while your parents did the cross-country thing . I did that , not that it was easy , since he insisted on yowling and trying to claw me through the cat carrier the entire flight . But we 're here now , and that means he 's your responsibility . " " Nope , sorry , I 've got too much to do , what with the official Wenches ' Conference and all . Besides , Mom paid you to take care of him . " " Only for the flight ! " I dug through the ice in the cooler and extracted a chilled bottle of water . " They were supposed to be home by now to receive the horrible beast with open arms . " " Yeah , well , you know how Dad is . Once he gets an idea in his head , there 's no changing his mind . He 's always wanted to see the Klondike . " " He 's the only man I know who 'd feel it necessary to drive from Seattle to Ontario via Alaska , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moth , dammit ... argh ! No ! Spit it out ! Bad cat ! " " You really should keep a closer eye on him , " CJ said as I grabbed the cat and pulled out of his mouth the bit of tent he was gnawing on . " Mom 's really attached to him . She 'd never forgive you if anything happened to him . " Moth shot a slitted , yellow-eyed glare at me as I picked him up . " The feeling 's mutual , " I growled , and lugged him over to the pyramid of stuff in front of our tent . I checked the snap on the long leash that was tied onto a lounge chair , adjusted his harness so he could n't slip out of it again , and tethered him to the chair so I could put stuff away . " There is n't enough money in the world to pay me for having to babysit him for two whole weeks . " " Well , it 's not like you have a lot of other options , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of hauling the sleeping bags into the tent . " Oh , Pepper , I 'm sorry . That was n't nice of me . I did n't mean it . It 's not your fault that unemployment is so high in Seattle . " I shrugged the sting of her comment away and tossed the sleeping bags inside the musty , faintly mildew-scented tent . " It may not be nice , but it 's the truth . I do n't have anything else to do except sit around and watch my unemployment benefits run out . " That was n't really the truth ; my days were very busy , what with job-hunting and all the volunteering I did to keep myself sane-I did n't even have time to date , let alone sit around and do nothing-but still , her point was taken . " Maybe if you went to California ? I always heard that was a good place for software engineers . " " It was , which is why when so many of us were laid off two years ago , everyone moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass migration south , I 'd have a better chance at finding a job where I was , but ... " I shrugged , unwilling to dwell on my increasingly desperate situation . This was supposed to be my vacation , my man-hunting , romantic , " fall madly in love with some gorgeous guy " vacation . I wanted to forget the depressing life I would have to face if it all came to nothing . " Is n't there anything else you can do ? " CJ asked , her brow wrinkled as she sat on her heels watching me . " You 've got a degree ; surely there must be some job- " I shifted a few more boxes into the tent . " You 'd think so , huh ? But since there were some fifty thousand other people let go by the local airplane company , there 's nada job-wise . Squat . Zilcho . Not even a McDonald 's fry-jockey job . " " Boy , that is hard . " CJ sucked her lower lip for a moment as I flopped down exhaustedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snaking down the valley between my breasts . " I guess you do n't really have any other option but to find yourself a man , fall in love with him , and live happily ever after . Fortunately , I 'm here to help you . " My shoulders slumped as the full realization of what I was doing hit me . I 'd been in delusional mode ever since my cousin had convinced me that she 'd be able to hook me up with a veritable God of perfection , courtesy of the local Renaissance Faire and international jousting competition . And now here I was , actually believing her promise of finding me a man , a soul mate , someone who would fill my empty , lonely life . It was all so ... sordid . Unrealistic . Stupid . I let my damp forehead drop into my hands as I moaned . " Oh , Ceej , what am I doing ? Why did I let you talk me into this ? Your plan is ridiculous , utterly ridiculous ! What was I thinking ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and half of one from the vet school I quit before I got eaten by something big with sharp teeth , and guys do n't even look twice at me . Why on earth did I imagine that you can find me a man in two weeks when I have n't in sixteen years of concerted searching ? " " Because I can ! " She tipped her head to the side as I rocked miserably on the cooler . " I told you that Butcher and I met at the Faire last year , and we were madly in love after just a couple of days . " " He lives in England . You live here , " I pointed out , wondering if I should n't just give in and have an indulgent wallow in self-pity . " But I see him every couple of months , and just as soon as I get that job at the BBC , we 'll be set . And then there was Fairuza Spenser , Cathy Baker , and Mary Denhelm . " I looked up , having decided against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my local chapter whom I introduced to their respective husbands last year at various Faires . You 'll meet them later . And the year before that there were three others whom I also found hubbies for . I 'm a matchmaker extraordinaire , so relax and place yourself fully in my capable hands . Before the Faire is over , I will have not only found you your perfect man , but you 'll be deeply in love and well on the way to happily-ever-aftering . " " Life is not a fairy tale , " I said morosely , wanting to believe her , but knowing that things like that just did n't happen to people like me . " No , it 's better , " she said calmly , then frowned as her brows drew together . " You have to help , though , Pepper . You ca n't just stand around waiting for the love of your life to swoop you up and carry you off . " " Why not ? We 're surrounded by knights in shining armor . " Her frown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're totally committed to the idea of finding a guy . " " Committed like to a madhouse ? " " Pepper ! " I held up my hands in mock surrender . " Okay , okay , little joke . I 'm committed ; I really am . " " I hope so , because once I find a guy for you , you 're expected to keep him . I just worry that you 're not really serious about this . After all , look what you 've done at home . " I stood up and glared down at where she sat poking through the bag . " What do you mean , what I 've done at home ? I have n't done anything ! " She grabbed a handful of jeans around my knee region and tugged me down to the cooler . " Stop looming over me like a great hulk . You 're too tall . I ca n't bend my head back far enough to see you . And that 's exactly what I mean-you seem to expect the perfect man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find him , but that 's not going to happen unless you get proactive . You have to admit that until now , you have n't actually expended any energy in dating . " I grabbed her ear and peered in . " Hellooo , anyone home ? " She slapped my hand away . " Did n't you hear me on the drive up here ? I 've looked and looked and looked , but all the guys back home are either unemployed plane mechanics or likewise unemployed software geeks . The first group hang around bars ogling women and having competitions about who can pee the farthest , while the second thinks a wild time is getting drunk and creating dirty computer animations . " " Maybe your standards are too high , " CJ said thoughtfully as she eyed me up and down . " There 's nothing really wrong with you . You 're pretty , in a general sort of way . You have nice thick red hair . And freckles-guys like freckles . And if you 're a bit ... well ... solid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys . And you 're smart ; that 's a plus . " I paced the length of the tent , avoiding Moth as he lunged for my ankles when I passed in front of him . " You try it , cat , and you 're going to find yourself locked into the tent for the next two weeks . Thank you for your so reassuring assessment of my many fine qualities , CJ . " " You 're also stubborn , very set in your ways , and you like to argue , but that 's okay , I think we can work around those points . " She gestured expressively with her tiny little hands . I added that to the list of injuries I was nursing . In addition to being gainfully employed by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as a researcher-a job that allowed her to travel to England several times a year-CJ was graceful , delicately built , and had a charming little heart-shaped face and a fragile manner that left most men prostrate before her . I , on the other hand , was built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother always used to tell me . Big-boned , tall , and gawky-that was me . The only way a man was going to be prostrate before me was if he accidentally ran into me and was knocked out cold . I knew it was n't fair to add CJ 's genetic makeup to my list of ways the world was picking on me , but I was too crabby to care . " I do n't know , maybe it 's me . Maybe something 's wrong with me . " Continues ...
