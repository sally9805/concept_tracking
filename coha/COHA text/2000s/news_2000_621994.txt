<p> The egg , a kitchen workhorse delivered in one of nature 's most ingenious packages , is getting beaten up again . <p> Having survived the cholesterol scare of the ' 90s , the egg is facing perhaps a tougher foe : President Clinton 's Egg Safety Action Plan . <p> The idea is to eradicate Salmonella enteritidis , a relatively new strain of the bacteria that first showed up in eggs on the East Coast during the 1980s and has made hundreds of thousands of people sick . <p> The plan , details of which are still being finalized , could possibly lead to wholesale pasteurization of the nation 's egg supply  --  a change as radical as the campaign to pasteurize milk 80 years ago . <p> As part of the effort , the government plans to teach America to rethink how it cooks the 68 billion eggs eaten annually . That means no more eggs over easy , and changes in recipes for everything from ice cream and meringue to hollandaise sauce and Caesar salads . <p> But critics of the president 's egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game that pits egg farmers against consumer activists . The fight against Salmonella enteritidis is about five years too late , they say . The rate of illness from this bacteria has already dropped and is continuing to do so . Rapidly . <p> At a federal hearing in Sacramento earlier this month , government officials said that from 1996 to 1998 , the number of Salmonella enteritidis-related illnesses cases fell by 44 percent , to about 230,000 a year . In the past 15 years , 79 deaths have been attributed to Salmonella enteritidis <p> By its own estimates , the government believes that only 1 in 20,000 eggs contains Salmonella enteritidis , which can be killed simply by cooking eggs so they are no longer runny . Opponents like to point out that at a rate of five deaths a year , fewer people die from eating Salmonella enteritidis-tainted eggs than from lightning strikes . <p> Ralph Ernst , a poultry specialist in the animal sciences department of the University of California at Davis , said : " If you drive to the store to get eggs , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw . So how much time do you want to spend worrying about eggs ? " <p> The president 's policy and the rush to pasteurize eggs are really about the politics of food safety , said Hans Reimann , a recently retired UC Davis professor and one of the nation 's top authorities on egg-related safety and epidemiology . <p> " What 's going on here is sort of a media scare , and regulatory agencies feel compelled to do something . " <p> Poultry researchers and farmers say the government is mounting a major attack on Salmonella enteritidis because it is a manageable battle that can be won  --  despite questions about the actual threat of salmonella . " The president said he was going to do it , so it will be done , " Ernst said . <p> But to Laurie Girand , a Saratoga food activist whose daughter fell ill in 1996 when she drank unpasteurized Odwalla juice infected with E coli , arguments like that are industry doublespeak . <p> " I think of this as a power struggle between business wanting to go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us sick anymore , " said Girand , who is part of a panel advising the government on its new egg law . " The truth of the matter is they 're bringing biohazards into the home in the form of an egg . " <p> Those are fighting words to Petaluma Farms egg man Steve Mahrt . He said he already goes to great lengths to keep his flock free from Salmonella enteritidis . And if he is forced to pasteurize all of his eggs in the shell , he 'll be out of business . In-shell pasteurizing machines just coming on the market cost as much as $1.5 million , a price he can not afford . <p> " If they require pasteurization , " he said , " it would be the end of family egg farms . " <p> Mahrt and others say the real issue is a society that increasingly demands the impossible : 100 percent risk-free food . <p> " We can cook it all to 170 degrees and not touch it , and everything will taste like an old TV dinner , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning is hazardous . " <p> CLINTON 'S PLAN OF ATTACK <p> Clinton 's egg plan calls for reducing the estimated 230,000 cases of Salmonella enteritidis poisoning by half by 2005 and eliminate them entirely by 2010 . <p> To do that , the Department of Agriculture , the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plan to test egg farms for the bacteria . If it 's found in chickens or just in their hen houses , millions of eggs would either be destroyed or sent for mass pasteurization . <p> These are expensive propositions that involve either breaking the eggs and pasteurizing them as a liquid for large-scale food-service use or using a new and largely unproven technology that would pasteurize them in the shell . <p> No matter what , all egg cartons will soon bear cigarette-style warning labels that read , in part , " Eggs may contain harmful bacteria known to cause serious illness . " And consumers are already being advised to cook all eggs until firm . <p> If these efforts do not reduce illnesses caused by Salmonella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America is either irradiated , pasteurized or produced by a vaccinated chicken . It would mark a wholesale change , reminiscent of time when pasteurizing milk became the law of the land early in the century . The process eliminated the cream line and changed the taste of whole milk . <p> But eggs and milk are quite different . The shell is a safe protective package , those opposed to mass pasteurization say , and existing technology to pasteurize eggs changes their nature . Tests in The Chronicle 's kitchen substantiated those claims and showed the pasteurized eggs did not perform as well as traditional eggs . ( See story in today 's Food section . ) <p> Although no one can say why the rates of Salmonella enteritidis - related infections are dropping , Emilio Esteban , CDC assistant director for public health , credits two things . <p> One is that farmers and packers have started voluntary programs to improve egg-handling practices . Second , health departments orchestrated a public-education campaign designed to teach restaurant workers and home cooks how to handle eggs properly to avoid under cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ON THE BLOCK <p> Salmonella enteritidis is a relative newcomer in the world of food-borne pathogens , showing up inside eggs in the Northeast in the early 1980s , then spreading to California  --  particularly Southern California  --  in the mid-1990s . <p> Unlike the other estimated 2,000 commonly occurring strains of salmonella , some of which live on the shells of eggs and are controlled through egg washing , Salmonella enteritidis has a peculiar trait : It lives inside , rather than outside , the egg shell . <p> No one knows why it cropped up or can make sense of its infection patterns . In general , deaths attributed to Salmonella enteritidis are rare . <p> Since 1985 , when the Salmonella enteritidis epidemic began , 79 deaths have been linked to it  --  17 in California . Most cases have been among the elderly or immune-compromised people in nursing homes or hospitals who are more susceptible to the effects of salmonella . By comparison , the Clinton administration estimates that about 9,000 deaths a year are attributed to all types of food poisoning . <p> The problem with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder one looks . In fact , no one is sure how many people get sick from Salmonella enteritidis , in large part because many cases are not severe enough to get counted . <p> Most healthy adults who eat a tainted egg probably will not get sick . If they do , they probably will experience a case of diarrhea or other flu-like symptoms . <p> The president 's egg plan still has a few more miles to travel before it becomes law . Based on information gathered at the public hearings and sent to the USDA , the rules will be polished , cost estimates will be finalized and a draft will be issued by the end of the year . Final rules should be in place by 2001 . <p> In the meantime , the government effort to educate cooks about handling eggs will continue , and state and federal health officials hope the Salmonella enteritidis rates will keep declining . <p> But until either all eggs are pasteurized  --  the nation 's first mass-market brand is due to hit Northern California groceries later this year  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their product , consumers will have to decide just how much of a risk under-cooked eggs are . <p> Find President Clinton 's egg safety action plan at www.foodsafety.com
