It is smooth to the touch , cool and solid . It is worn , but not so much that its extraordinary message can not be read . The small limestone box , the color of sand , nearly 2,000 years old , sits on its Israeli owner 's kitchen cabinet . Its inscription , as with most Semitic writing , starts on the right . " Ya'akov , bar Yosef , " it begins , carved strong and deep in the stone . James , son of Joseph . Then , slightly more eroded , " akhui di ... " Brother of . And at the end , clearly visible from only close up , " Yeshua . " Jesus . The language is the Aramaic spoken by Jews in Jerusalem in the 1st century A.D. , but the words are so simple that any Hebrew reader would know the meaning . Here , in this bone-box , or ossuary , once lay the earthly remains of " James , son of Joseph , brother of Jesus . " <P> Yes , James , the son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of believers know as the Christ . Or at any rate , such was the claim made on the box 's behalf last week at a remarkable Washington press conference by the magazine Biblical Archaeology Review . ( The container stayed in Israel , where TIME was given a private showing . ) In the publication 's cover story , Andre Lemaire , one of the world 's foremost scholars of ancient scripts , announced that " it seems very probable that this box is the ossuary of the James in the New Testament . " <P> If the 10-in. by 20-in. by 12-in. receptacle is authentic  --  and scholars have no reason to believe it 's not  --  and if the inscription refers to the right James  --  a somewhat dicier proposition  --  this would be the most important discovery in the history of New Testament archaeology . It would also underscore the fact that early Christians still thought of themselves as essentially Jewish ( the use of ossuaries at the time was a Jewish custom ) and would pose something of a theological problem for the Roman Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James ' ossuary , if real , could become a kind of trans-denominational , scientifically approved relic . The Roman Catholic and various Orthodox churches , all of which regard James as a saint , would venerate it as a relic . Southern Baptist leader Paige Patterson , while warning against " building faith on archaeological discovery , " predicts that even conservative Protestants would probably find it " fascinating " and " enormously useful in evangelizing and shedding light on our understanding of the Scriptures . " <P> Almost no educated person these days doubts that Jesus lived . Some accept it on faith , others on the testimony of a brace of ancient chroniclers , both Christian and Roman . Yet there is something uniquely compelling about an attestation in stone . As Lemaire explained to TIME , " The written word is a bit airy . Listen , you can talk about Egyptian civilization , but the day you visit the pyramids , it speaks to you in a different way .
