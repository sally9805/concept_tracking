Though the inscription on this statue says so . Harvard was not founded in 1638 by John Harvard . It was renamed for him sometime after its 1636 founding . // It 's not often that a merit badge show takes on truly historic proportions . But one Saturday in March , 270 Scouts ca n't help but feel a part of America 's past as they make their way toward the steps of Harvard University 's Sever Hall . They pass Massachusetts Hall , which was built in 1720 and once housed soldiers of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War . Entering Harvard Yard , the Scouts saunter by the John Harvard statue , created by the same sculptor who made the Lincoln Memorial in Washington , D.C. These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , N.Y. , are at Harvard in Cambridge , Mass. , to attend the first of two days of the Boston Minuteman Council 's Merit Badge University .

WRITE A STORY , SAVE A LIFE Harvard junior Jonathan Esensten , an editor at The Harvard Crimson newspaper and an Eagle Scout from Troop 4 in Pasadena , Calif. , and Derrick Jackson , a columnist for The Boston Globe , start the Scouts in the Journalism class with a tour of Harvard 's newsroom and large printing press . Esensten mentions that it takes only 15 minutes for the printing press to churn out 3,000 copies of the newspaper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Arlington , Mass. , says that " getting a look in here makes it worth a merit badge . " Will knows what it takes to hammer out a story , because he is assistant editor at his school 's magazine . Back at Sever Hall , Eagle Scout and event organizer Andrew Miller , a Harvard junior , is busy teaching a CPR course . Scouts stand up and do a " soft " version of the procedure on one another . Then they learn mouth-to-mouth resuscitation . Deryn Diorio , 12 , of Troop 737 in Chelsea , Mass. , said " I 'd be pretty nervous having to do mouth-to-mouth on someone , but I could do it .

Each Scout receives two test tubes , each containing different fruit or juice . Adding blue dye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Scout can gauge which of the two tubes contains more vitamin C. Adam Clay , 16 , of Troop 705 in Reading , Mass. , needs only two drops of dye to turn the color of his apple juice , but a whopping 36 drops for his far more vitamin C-rich grapefruit . Scouts find other courses just as intriguing . Andrew Hedberg , 15 , from Troop 10 in Needham , Mass. , says Public Speaking " allowed me to talk on my feet better . " Tano Holmes learned about his hometown of Cambridge in Citizenship in the Community . And in Oceanography , " we got to go to the Charles River and collect samples of plankton , " notes David Strickland , 13 , of Troop 51 in Mansfield , Mass . FINISHING A JOB WELL DONE Andrew Miller walks through the hallways of Harvard with a wide grin plastered on his face . After all , it was his idea to bring the Merit Badge University to Harvard . And in turn , to bring a little bit of Harvard-and history-to area Scouts . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people here is a great thrill , " Miller says . " It 's a wonderful opportunity to give a little back to Scouting from everything it gave me . " And that 's a statement of truly historic proportions . Sidebar CREATE YOUR OWN MERIT BADGE UNIVERSITY A lot of hard work goes into putting on an event like the Merit Badge University , but the rewards are great . All it takes is a dedicated unit or individual to do the legwork . Here are the steps Andrew Miller took to set up the Harvard event : 1 . Talk to your local council . Miller first went over the idea of holding an MBU at Harvard with the Cambridge District and the Boston Minuteman Council . 2 . Find merit badge counselors-lots of them . Miller found adults , many of them Harvard students , to teach merit badges and space at Harvard through the organization he created , Harvard Friends of Scouting. 3 . Get the word out . The Boston Minuteman Council sent a brochure to every Scout in the area while Miller helped set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the main site at **35;1761;TOOLONG ) . // <p>
