The country 's economic crisis has slammed Sandra Kasper 's family harder than many . Her husband has lost his job as a home remodeler , and their own house of 14 years went into foreclosure . For Kasper , 40 , who 's an office manager and the mother of three , the hard times mean constant worry about finances . But there 's more : The anxiety has also triggered severe panic attacks . And even when she 's able to cope with them , she 's in constant fear of another attack . " I like to be in control , " says Kasper . " But this is completely out of my control . " Her first attack occurred while she was driving with her daughter near their Grafton , OH , home . Kasper could n't breathe , she felt her heart racing , her hands were sweaty and shaky , and she was light-headed . Though in perfect health , she felt like she was having a heart attack . She pulled over , caught her breath , and decided she probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month later , Kasper had an attack at work and was rushed to the hospital . " I was sure I was dying , " she says . But after doing a battery of tests , doctors found nothing physically amiss . <p> Back home , she typed her symptoms into an Internet search engine and learned what was wrong : She was having panic attacks . <p> Kasper did n't have to wonder why . It was shortly after her husband had lost his job . Afraid of having another panic attack , she became reluctant to leave the house . She took a leave from her job and went out for only one reason : to see a psychologist . After a month on half-pay disability , Kasper returned to work . " It 's probably good that I had to go back , or I might never have left my house , " she says . Today , however , she can no longer afford her therapist ; instead , she turns to an online support group and tries to draw on the techniques she learned in therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The financial downturn has people all over the country in emotional distress . Women , especially , are feeling it ; 83 percent say that they 're stressed about money , reports a recent survey by the American Psychological Association . Those ages 44 to 62 are the most worried , the survey found . Though it 's not certain how many women are having panic attacks as a result  --  or suffering a recurrence of attacks-therapists say they are definitely seeing more patients . " The bad economy has affected the number of people coming to our facility , " says Kelley Clancy , vice president of external affairs at Alexian Brothers Hospital Network , outside Chicago , a center that specializes in mental health care . " The situation is very alarming . " <p> What 's just as disturbing : Many more sufferers wo n't know where to turn , and even if they try to find help , they may not get the treatment that can make a real difference . <p> L : WHAT GOES WRONG Some six million Americans suffer from panic disorder  --  recurrent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persistent concern about having another . While symptoms vary , they usually include a speeding heart , light-headedness , sweating , and a feeling of doom . Panic attacks often lead to phobias , like a fear of small spaces or driving . Although medication and therapy can help sufferers overcome these fears , some end up spending years in hiding , hoping to avoid anything that might trigger an attack . They become too anxious to go to a crowded place , such as a mall ; in extreme cases , they are unable to venture out at all . <p> The underlying cause is still unknown , but family history appears to be an important factor : First-degree relatives of sufferers ( parents , siblings , children ) are four to seven times more likely to have the disorder . Hormones probably figure in , too : Women panic patients outnumber men two to one . <p> But life issues also come into play . " Patients experience panic attacks as coming out of nowhere , but often in therapy , they find a cause , " says Barbara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medical College in New York City . <p> Of course , for Sandra Kasper , the life issues were only too vivid . Her story was unusual in another way , too : She was able to get help quickly . Astonishingly , on average , women see 10 different doctors , from the emergency room physician to the cardiologist to the neurologist , before finding out what 's wrong , says Jerilyn Boss , director of the Washington , D.C.-based Boss Center for Anxiety &; Belated Disorders . <p> Given that panic disorder is far from rare , why do physicians have so much trouble making a diagnosis ? " Doctors are trained to rule out disorders , " says Dr. Milrod . " Especially in the EB , once they determine that you 're not having a heart attack or a serious neurological problem , they 'll often send you on your way without exploring what might be behind your symptoms . " <p> L : TREATMENTS THAT WORK Even doctors who recognize that their patients are suffering from panic attacks may simply prescribe an antianxiety medication and feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment must be fine-tuned before you find relief . For some , antidepressants may work best . In studies , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like Prozac or Zoloft reduced the severity and number of attacks in about 60 percent of patients in six to 12 weeks . <p> Panic disorder sufferers can also benefit from therapy . In a recent study of one particular treatment  --  panic-focused psychodynamic psychotherapy  --  Dr. Milrod found that 73 percent of patients got better after three months of twice-a-week sessions . Another effective option : cognitive-behavioral therapy . In CBT sessions you may learn simple skills such as panic-relieving breathing techniques . You may also work on retraining your mind by replacing negative thoughts with positive or more realistic ones while exposing yourself to anxiety-provoking situations , so those activities are no longer associated with danger . <p> If you seek counseling , make sure the therapist is experienced in treating panic . ( The Anxiety Disorders Association of America  --  adaa.org  --  lists specialists , or ask your family doctor or the psychology department at a local hospital or university for referrals . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ; if you do n't , advises Dr. Milrod , get another opinion or consider switching counselors . " We have a lot of ways to treat panic today , " says Ross . <p> That 's all the more reason why , in 2009 , no one should be sent home from the ER with the simple reassurance that she has n't had a heart attack and is OK  --  not unless she also understands that she might be suffering from panic disorder and that there 's good help available . <p> L : THERAPY ... WITHOUT LEAVING HOME Until recently , it was one of the cruel ironies of panic disorder that something that could help  --  psychotherapy-was not available to sufferers who had become too fearful to travel to new places or even to leave the house . Now these patients can turn to the Internet for therapy , on some sites 24 hours a day . One of the largest , mytherapynet.com , offers licensed , insured therapists of varying specialties , all of whom are extensively reviewed to confirm education , degrees , and experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ph.D . Sessions can take the form of instant-messaging with a therapist , private chat room conversations , or phone sessions . Cost , on average , is $1.60 per minute ( or $80 for a 50-minute session-lower than in-office fees in many areas . <p> As the site acknowledges , the primary benefit of online therapy is convenience , particularly for those who are housebound or ca n't find the right expert in their area . The drawback is the format : Though a few therapists use Web cams , set up at your computer and in their offices , most rely only on typed words , so they 're not getting the tone of voice , facial expressions , and gestures that may be helpful for treatment . <p> Online therapy , which is only about 15 years old , is not well studied yet . But preliminary research offers good reports . In a 2006 Swedish study of 60 patients , 77 percent overcame their panic disorders after 10 weeks of online therapy combined with weekly 10-minute phone sessions .

But her memory of the panic attack she 'd suffered three months earlier was too vivid . Then she learned about the Virtual Reality Treatment Program at Duke University , which helps patients overcome phobias and anxiety . Sitting on a mock airplane seat and wearing a headset , Fagan listened to a pilot 's announcement , watched a crew prepare the plane , waited for takeoff , then sat through a short flight  --  all simulated . A therapist talked her through moments of impending panic and taught her ways to overcome it  --  deep breathing , calming words , distractions . Eventually , Fagan realized she could make It through without panicking , and that alleviated her fears of getting on a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Fagan , who went to the center every week for two months ; three months after her canceled Australia trip , she flew to Hawaii  --  panic-free . <p> The VR program at Duke was developed by Virtually Better ; the company has private and university centers around the country .
