Chapter One living in fiascoland saturday june 18th 9:00 p.m . I ca n't believe I am once more on the rack of romance . And also in the oven of luuurve . And possibly on my way to the bakery of pain . And maybe even going to stop along the way to get a little cake at the cakeshop of agony . Shut up , brain , shut up . 9:01 p.m . Looking out my window at the stars . It says in my Meditation for the Very Backward book that it is soothing looking at the universe and stars and everything . Ommmm. 9:03 p.m . The meditation book is wrong . God , stars are annoying . Winking and blinking like twinkly idiots . Why are they are so cheerful ? 9:03 p.m. and a half I 'll tell you why they are so cheerful , because they are not me . They know nothing of the call of the Horn and snogging . Has a Luuurve God ever said to one of them , " I will let you know in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you or not " ? No . Anyway , what are stars for actually ? You ca n't even read by them . They just hang about . Like dim torches . 9:04 p.m . Hanging about is not exactly a job , is it ? 9:05 p.m . I am not as such feeling any calmer . 9:10p.m . Being in the bakery of pain is vair vair boring . Ten past nine on a Saturday night and I am in my bedroom . Alone . I am in the prime of my  --  er  --  hornosity and joie de vivre and nothing is going on . Nothing . It 's like the grave in this house I . . . Oh good . My darling little sister has kicked open my door and flung Angus at me . " HEGGGGOOO Gingey ! ! ! We is back . Heggo ! ! ! Watch my panties dance . Sex bum sex bum am a sex bum ! ! ! " Oh dear Gott in Himmel . Angus was livid at being thrown and once he 'd stopped doing that cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ankle . Owwwwwww . Now I 'm on the way to the cakeshop of aggers with a gammy leg . Hurray ! Libby put her frock over her head and waggled her botty around like a pole dancer . Where does she see people doing these things ? They 've just come back from the lunatic asylum , i.e. , Granddad 's sheltered housing , so it will be something she has seen there . I 've seen the residents in their so-called communal " lounge . " They pretend to play dominoes , but secretly they practice being mad . And probably prance around in their incontinence knickers . Then Mum came mumming in and scooped up Bibbs . " Time for boboland , young lady . " Libby carried on singing and wiggling around in Mum 's arms , and then Mum noticed me . Being in my bedroom . " What are you up to , Georgia ? Why are you in here ? " I said , " Not that anyone notices , but this is actually my room . You know , for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens . " Mum said as she went out , " Oh you must be sooo tired , all that lip gloss and mascara to carry round all day . " Vair vair amusing . Not . 9:25 p.m . I 've been in my bedroom more or less for forty-eight hours , give or take snack and loo breaks . Oh and a quick visit to the shops for essentials . Mascara . And a new nunga-nunga holder . And a copy of Cosmo . It is forty-eight hours since Masimo left me at my door saying he would let me know if he wanted me to be his girlfriend or not . Why did I admit I wanted him to be like my proper boyfriend ? Why why ? 9:26 p.m . And also thrice why ? Whyitwhyitwhy ? Why could n't I have just been a callous sophisticate ? I could for once have just shut up and been all full of casualosity and savoir whatsit . 9:30 p.m . If I 'd played my cards right I could have had loads of boyfriends . All at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boyfriend , with a touch of Dave the Laugh ( oo-er ) for a rainy weekday . And also maybe even the former Sex God ( whose name I 'm not going to mention even beyond the grave ) as a sort of Kiwi-a-gogo airmail boyfriend . But , oh no , I had to moan on about wanting to be Masimo 's one and only . 9:40 p.m . I was so happy snogging Masimo under the stars on our date . Stars did n't get on my nerves then . Nothing did . 9:42 p.m . How come I am living in Fiasco land again ? One minute he was snogging me under the twinkly twits , and then the next day he is off to Late and Live with Wet Lindsay , stick insect and drip . I am haunted by Old Droopy Drawers . First she enticed you know who , whose name I will never mention even beyond the grave , but as a clue his name starts with R and ends in obbie . Now she has slimed her way around Masimo . I hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a nutshell , is n't it ? Well , mine , anyway , all fabby and marvy and then all pooey and merde . 9:45 p.m . What was it Charlie Dickens said in his famous book Oliver Twit ? Ah yes , " forsooth and lack a day all ye worlde is-eth a stage and verily we-eth are players in-ith it . Gadzooks . " Or was that Billy Shakespeare ? Who knows ? Who cares ? What does it mean , anyway ? And why do none of those beardy Elizabethan types know how to speak proper English ? What does anything mean ? midnight Oh I ca n't bear this . How many hours is it until Masimo tells me his answer ? Perhaps I should phone him and tell him that I did n't mean what I said about him being my one and only one . I could say that he can go out with Wet Lindsay as well as long as he likes me. ten past midnight But that would mean I might snog him after she had snogged him and that would mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live with that .
