Before you invest in a solar electric system , put some energy into choosing a skilled solar installer . If you ca n't find an installer listed in your hometown Yellow Pages , let your fingers do the walking on the Web . Home Power magazine ( www.homepower.com ) has a searchable database of renewable energy dealers and installers , organized by state . And with chapters in 33 states , your local chapter of the American Solar Energy Society www.ases.org ; ( 303 ) 443-3130 also may be able to provide you with a list of renewable energy installers and dealers . Photograph In most cases , you will need a professional installer to successfully complete your solar transition , so do n't sell yourself short when choosing one . // Professional credentials . Some organizations train installers by guidelines set by the North America Board of Certified Energy Professionals ( see " Get Your Hands-On Solar , " Page 73 ) . Many seasoned professionals , however , choose to not put forth the extra time or expense to become a NABCEP-certified PV installer . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to evaluate other credentials , such as their customer references . While electricians have experience with electrical systems , PV systems may be foreign to many licensed electricians . However , if you hire an installer who does n't have an electrical license , you also may need to find a licensed electrician to pull the permit and do the final AC hookups . Training . Some companies who manufacture and/or distribute renewable energy products offer formal training and classes . Find out if the installer has taken advantage of any training courses provided by manufacturers . Only a handful of formal degree or training programs in renewable energy have been established and most of these programs are fairly new , so do n't be surprised if the expert you hired is self-taught or apprenticed . As in many fields , experience is as valuable as classroom education . Experience . Each PV installation is different , and the more experience with various systems , the more situations the installer will know how to troubleshoot . Find out how many systems similar to yours the installer has designed and installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established every year . A PV installer who has performed several recent installations should be familiar with the newest products and the latest code issues . Variety and quality of products . The more brands an installer carries , the more likely he or she will have one that fits your application . However , if the installer only carries a couple of brands and those brands work for your system , variety is not as important as the quality of the products . Research the inverter , controller and other components that an installer suggests to determine if the products meet industry standards . Many products undergo rigorous testing by the Underwriters Laboratory ( UL ) , a nonprofit product-safety testing and certification organization . The Canadian Standards Association ( CSA ) also provides a similar approval . Checking products to make sure they are UL- or CSA-approved is one way to gauge if the products are reliable and safe . Home Power magazine also frequently reviews products . ( You can access back issues of the magazine on their Web site . ) Last but not least , check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantees . Installers should provide some kind of optional service agreement to you . Make sure you discuss what services they will provide - and how long they will provide service - if problems arise with your system . Will they be readily available to troubleshoot a problem ? For what portion of the repair costs will they be accountable ? Determine who will be responsible for maintaining the system . ( Off-grid systems require more maintenance than panels connected to the grid . ) If you will be the one responsible , what kind of training will the installer provide to you ? Although there are no standard service or maintenance agreements , many installers will agree to a site visit at least once a year to check the system 's performance . Most homeowners benefit from a service maintenance contract in the early years of a system 's performance to help ensure the system runs smoothly . The bottom line : While the installer is sizing up the system , you should be sizing up the installer . Online and mail-order suppliers who never visit the installation site may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on-site , solar and load analysis and two-way interview can help ensure a thoughtfully designed and well-planned installation . <p>
