Section : Body In a newly trim body , author Anne Rice is starting a new life  --  one without her beloved husband or favorite vampire <p> Anne Rice descends the marble staircase that sweeps into the foyer of her New Orleans mansion , which is staffed by 30 people and possibly haunted by one ghost  --  a former occupant who shot himself on these very stairs , circa 1857 . She 's wearing just what you 'd imagine the author of Interview with the Vampire wears around the house : a black velvet gown as clingy as anything hanging in Morticia Addams 's closet . <p> But this is n't any old dress . She bought it back in 1996 and , owing to steady weight gain , was rarely able to wear it . Taking it out , says Rice , 62 , " was a great event , because now I can get into it . " <p> Since January Rice has lost 103 lbs .  --  the result of gastric bypass surgery , in which the stomach is made a tiny fraction of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who required insulin shots , Rice , who is 5 ' 2 " , now rides a stationary bike daily and has drastically reduced her insulin dosage . <p> The new body is just one of many changes : Despite the bustle of activity in her landmark home , Rice is , at least by one definition , living alone . Her marriage to high school sweetheart Stan Rice , a poet and artist , ended with his death last December from brain cancer at 60 . " My personal life is still revealing itself , " says Rice reflectively . " I was married for 41 years , and suddenly I 'm not married anymore . " <p> The loss , though profound  --  they were " madly , totally in love " she says  --  did n't slow the prolific author . " Anne is a person who uses adversity to grow and change , " says her sister Alice Borchardt , also a novelist . " Some people would crawl into a corner . She does n't . " <p> Adding to her 25 novels ( there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blood Canticle , the ninth in her vampire Lestat series . Since Interview in 1976 , she 's specialized in sensual , supernatural tales in which blood flows like liquor in the French Quarter . Canticle marks another turning point . <p> " I think this is the last vampire book I 'll do , " says Rice calmly , as if the announcement wo n't turn her devout goth fans a whiter shade of pale . ( Do n't worry : An NBC miniseries of Rice 's The Witching Hour is in development , and a Vampire Broadway musical scored by Elton John is planned for 2005 . ) But she 's firm : " No more of Lestat , no more of his cohorts , no more of the witches either . " <p> Rice began cavorting with fictional demons after a real-life tragedy  --  the 1972 death of her 5-year-old daughter Michele from leukemia . " It was awful . There was nothing to do but to go through it , " Rice remembers . " I just grieved , drank and felt guilty that I had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcomed a son , Christopher , now 25 and a writer in L.A. Though she 'd been skinny as a girl , Rice began piling on the pounds . " It made me feel unsexy , " she says . " But I was happily married so I did n't do anything about it . " When Christopher was 5 , however , " he said something to me about being fat . That was enough . " <p> Over several years Rice slimmed down on plans including Weight Watchers and the Diet Center program . Each time , though , she regained the weight . <p> Finally , in 1998 Rice fell into a diabetic coma ; though she 'd felt ill for months , she had no idea she had diabetes . When she awoke in a hospital with a tube down her throat , " I worried I 'd been abducted by aliens , " she laughs . " Then I looked at the ceiling and thought , ' Aliens would n't have these ugly tiles . ' " <p> She jokes now , but she knew she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2002 PEOPLE story on Al Roker 's gastric bypass surgery offered inspiration : Stan showed it to her , and she decided she wanted the surgery . Shortly after his death , she scheduled the procedure , which went off without complication . Eating tiny meals , Rice began dropping pounds right away . Then she added exercise : Throughout the day she lifts hand weights , a set of which she keeps in various rooms throughout the house  --  including the loo . <p> Between workouts , Rice is busy with a new book , the subject of which she 's keeping secret . She 's also opening the Stan Rice Gallery in New Orleans . And there 's always a buzz in that big house of hers  --  Elton John recently stopped by to discuss the musical . <p> The massive weight loss , says Rice , has given her the stamina to handle it all . " I 'm impossibly energetic , " she laughs . " No one can keep up with me . " And with a year of quiet mourning behind her , she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move out into the world and maybe even have a series of small parties . It 's going to be divine .
