IF I LOVED YOU , I WOULD TELL YOU THIS : <p> I would tell you that for all you know I have cancer . And that is why you should be kind to me . I would tell you that for all you know I have cancer that has spread into my liver and my bones and that now I understand there is no hope . If I loved you I would say : You should n't be so hard on us . On me and on Sam . <p> Because it may not even be just the cancer . <p> For all you know we have a brain-damaged son living in an inadequate institution thirty miles from our house . For all you know we agonized one long , cold winter night six years ago over whether to send him there . But then , broken , exhausted , we finally stood together in our kitchen , staring hard at one another , the worse for scotch , both of us , and just knew , just then at the exact same moment , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him so big I could n't bathe him by myself . Not with him so strong . Not with me just diagnosed and in for my second round of chemo . <p> There 's so much you do n't know . <p> For all you know I have three , maybe four months to live , and Sam is up every night trying to figure out how he 's going to break it to our brain-damaged son that I wo n't be coming to visit anymore . And I 'm lying right there next to him , hour after hour , trying not to think about the possibility that our boy will be angry at me for this . Or maybe worse , maybe better , that he wo n't even notice that I 'm gone . <p> You want to build a fence between our homes . <p> You 're tall and you 're young , and you paid a lot of money for that enormous house next to ours . <p> It will be solid wood , you say , with no space or light between the slats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the property line you had surveyed just this week . <p> Understand , you say , I did n't ask the surveyors to add land to my land . It just turns out that the line 's much closer to your house than anyone thought . I was every bit as surprised as you . <p> And for a moment all three of us-you , me , and Sam-stare down at the pachysandra-covered ground . <p> But if you build a six-foot-tall solid wall , I say , if you build it right where the pink flags are , I wo n't be able to open my car door . Not without banging into your fence . Not within twenty feet of my front door anyway . I 'll have to park at least twenty feet from my door . <p> You only nod . <p> Sam walks along the line , from flag to flag , then he says : You 're telling me those hemlocks belong to you ? You 're saying they 're not ours ? <p> It turns out they 're on my land , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them sprayed for years , I tell you . It 's been sixteen years . The whole time we 've lived here . We thought they were ours . <p> You say nothing . Sam says nothing . <p> Why six feet tall ? I finally ask . It seems awfully high . It 's so close to our house . We 'll just see a wall every time we come outside . We 're used to looking at the hemlocks . We 've always had a view . Maybe they do n't belong to us , but we 'll feel like we 're walled in . <p> We will be walled in , Sam says . <p> I need it that tall because I 'm going to get an animal . An animal could jump over a lower fence . <p> We 've been staring at these trees for sixteen years , I say . It 's going to be a big change . But that is n't the real problem . The real problem is that we wo n't be able to park in front of our house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter . Our full names are typed on the envelope-complete with our middle initials . You 've been looking through public records . You are doing this by the book . This is no friendly note held in my hand . It 's a document . <p> Here is the part I go over in my head : <p> When I think about your buying the house , having the land surveyed , finding the property line just about in your neighbors ' driveway , telling them you 're going to build a wall , a solid wall , right there , this is the part that I still do n't understand . <p> You know nothing about the reasons it might matter to us to be able to park right in front of our door . <p> For example , in the cancer scenario , I 'll grow weak . That 's inevitable . Walking twenty feet will feel like a mile to me . Maybe I could do it , make the walk from the car , if we were just a foot or two from the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way from where there 's room to open the door , that 's just too far . <p> So Sam is going to have to take out the folding wheelchair from the back . And wheel me up the drive . And then help me out from the chair . And then , when he 's settled me in the house , he 'll have to wheel the chair , empty now , back down the drive to the car . And every time he does this he 'll suffer . Every time , his heart will break . Because one day soon , he knows , the chair will be empty for real . <p> But back inside the house he tries to make me laugh , by imitating you . We 're going to get an animal , he says . An animal ! A hippopotamus , in fact . <p> What 's the deal , I ask , with a man who ca n't just say dog7 . <p> And then Sam says , Just do n't set a foot onto my land . My land , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised in the air . And I try to laugh , for Sam . But eventually I have to raise the question of whether it 's time for us to tell our son . Because I can feel that there are only three or four more visits left in me . Power is running from my legs like sand down an hourglass . Do we tell Todd in advance ? Or will I just be gone one day ? <p> We hire a lawyer . <p> I do n't want to , but your letter quotes township statutes and talks about your rights as a landowner . It 's just possible , Sam says , that we have rights , too . He looks so worn and haggard as he speaks . He looks as though this is one thing too many . I say , Go ahead , hon. Hire a lawyer . Let somebody else take this on . <p> Our lawyer sends you a letter . It says that we want you to hold up on construction while we investigate the situation . We want you to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around this . The phrase adverse possession appears in the second paragraph . We also send you a handwritten note , behind our lawyer 's back , saying we do n't want this to be a legal fight . Please . We just want you to let us open our car door in front of our house-as a courtesy . We only hired a lawyer because you gave us that document , you made it seem so official . We felt we had to do everything we could . <p> Your response comes hand delivered , overnight : " I have every right to erect a fence on my own property . " <p> It says a bit more . But not much . <p> There 's a conversation that has n't been had , I tell Sam . The conversation human beings have with each other . He is n't quite treating us like people . <p> He is n't quite a person , Sam says . He 's a creature . He 's an animal himself . He 's like a yeti or something . <p> He is ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face . The way he stomps around his land . It 's inspired , I say . He 's the yeti . <p> And that is what we call you after that . <p> I suppose it 's this ability of yours not to care that intrigues me so . <p> If I loved you , I would tell you how much you 're missing because of that . I would find ways to convince you that I exist . I would resist erasure every moment that I could . <p> For several weeks the letters fly back and forth . <p> You 're amazed that we think we have any rights . <p> We 're amazed that you think rights are what 's at issue here . <p> Sam says he 's going to paint a bright red stripe on our side of the line . It 'll be wet paint , he says . I 'll put it down on the day they 're building the fence . So if they set a foot on our property ... if they set even one foot on our property ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say . First one of them to step in red paint loses a leg . . . . <p> I want to scold you in the harsh , caressing tones of a mother to a child . I want to scold you , make you understand more about the way things should be than you do , make you think more , give you some imagination . I want you to imagine that I have a life . A life that matters . You should care about my life . <p> Sam stares out the kitchen window every night when he comes home from work <p> I 'll miss the trees , he says . I really will . <p> I do n't give an answer . Why make matters worse ? <p> Another possibility is that Sam is in danger of losing his job . <p> What if I have cancer , our son is out there in the institution , and , because the boy and I take up so much time , Sam is having trouble putting the hours in at work ? They 've tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the irony is it 's dragging on for too long . If I 'd died six months ago instead of four months from now , there might not be a problem . They 're good guys . They do care . But this is too much . <p> The fence goes up on a day when we 're out . <p> And you have no idea where we 've been . <p> If I loved you , I would invite you in , sit you down in that same kitchen , and I would say to you : You just never know . You , the yeti . You do n't know why this matters so much to us , why we care . You do n't know what secret pains we have that we have n't shared with you . You do n't know us . <p> But then I would have to admit that I do n't know everything either , would n't I ? Like I do n't know why it matters so much to you to build that fence exactly there . <p> What happened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Why do you think you should get what is your right ? <p> You 're so uncaring , so unreasonable . It must be a defense mechanism of some kind . I 'm sure that it is . <p> But Sam says that 's ridiculous of me . Even to think about you that way . <p> It 's late at night and neither one of us can sleep . I say to him I 'm sure that the yeti must have been hurt . Very badly . At some point in his life he must have been very badly hurt . Or he 'd understand our side . No one can care so little about other people unless they 've been very badly hurt . <p> Not necessarily , Sam tells me . Maybe the problem is he 's never been hurt . He ca n't imagine real pain because he 's never experienced it . <p> I feel his hand reach across the bed for my arm . <p> Or maybe some folks are just bad , he adds , then wraps his fingers around my wrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor sleepless husband . He says that to me twice . <p> II <p> On the day of the mammogram I was more worried about the technician seeing all the bruises on my arms than about the results . You 'll be lucky , I told Sam , if they do n't come and arrest you for wife abuse . <p> I hate to see you look like that . <p> I was standing in just a bra and panties . The bruises were all different colors , the newest ones purple , the oldest turning yellow . It 's not so bad , I said . He does n't mean it . He does n't know he 's hurting me . <p> I know he does n't mean it . I 'm not angry at him-you know that . I just hate to see you this way . <p> It 's nothing big , I said . He gets upset . He ca n't talk to us , so he lashes out . <p> But I understood the words were pointless , just filling the air between us with sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . There was only this ritual back-and-forth of repeating what we both already knew . <p> We kissed at the door and I watched him pull out his car , just behind mine in the driveway . He did n't wish me luck , and it never occurred to me that he should . <p> So , first there was the mammogram , at which I stood with my breasts and my mottled arms exposed . As the technician squeezed my flesh into position , I mumbled something about having fallen off my bike . I bruise very easily , I said . Not : My son had a stroke while in utero and is severely brain damaged . He is n't a bad boy at all , but he has these moments of violence , and these are the results . <p> Not that . <p> Then came the letter ordering me back for more tests , an ultrasound , the biopsy , the meeting in my doctor 's office-this time Sam right there by my side . And through all of this , about three weeks , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Todd . Not even what would happen to him if I died-I could n't die , that was out of the question , not on the table for discussion-but little things , like who would watch him while I went in for the biopsy and could I possibly take him to the doctor 's office with me and have him there in the room ? <p> It used to seem so simple : You 're young , you go through school , you fall in love , you marry , you get pregnant . And then the road takes a certain kind of curve . Your sense of self can disappear . <p> Todd : can not speak , can not walk , barely hears , is blind in one eye . Can not control his bladder or his bowels . Does he know us ? It 's never been clear . Until now I 'd always hoped that he did . I 'd always hoped that it gave him some kind of comfort to have me and have Sam there with him . But now I 'm not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself hoping sometimes he never really knew who I was . <p> Now , my yeti , I find myself hoping he may be like you . And so wo n't ever miss me when I 'm gone . <p> There was spreading into the lymph nodes . One doctor spoke about saving the breasts , and I said just do whatever will make this stop . I do n't give a shit about my breasts . <p> New questions arise : <p> Just how many fifths of scotch were the two of us going through every week ? <p> We tried not to count them in the recycling bin . And eventually we began to throw a couple of bottles into the garbage cans instead , split them up . Maybe Sam would take a bottle or two in the car and dump them somewhere else . It 's almost funny . <p> We were drunk the night we realized Todd would have to be moved . In vino veritas . In whiskey are decisions born . <p> Is this the brave thing to do or the coward 's way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honey . I just know it 's what has to happen now . And so do you . <p> Lawrence House : It 's a low-lying building filled with heartbreaks , among whom my son looks like part of a crowd . And people like me and like Sam pass one another with guilty looks on our faces . The first year , I went to see him just when I was well enough . The second year , there was no sign of spread . I was off chemo and I went almost every day . <p> Maybe we could bring him home , I said to Sam . We managed before and I 'm feeling fine now . He could come back . <p> Sam 's voice was quiet . He said , I do n't know if that 's something we should do . Remember how the two of you used to struggle ? You were covered with bruises , Ruth . You could n't handle him at all . <p> Well , let 's think about it anyway . Let 's just not say that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We wo n't say that we wo n't . <p> Sam deals the cards , counting quietly to himself . We 've kept the same deck beside Todd 's bed for all these years . <p> Fives ? I ask . <p> Go fish . <p> So I draw from the pile . <p> No , I say . Not a five . It 's your turn . <p> I look over at our boy . He is staring somewhere else . <p> My son is eighteen years old . His head is covered with thick black curls like my own used to be , and his eyes are the same bright blue as Sam 's . He would have been a very handsome man . He would have been something wonderful , I 'm convinced . But for the travels of a blood clot to his brain while he burrowed small and silenced in my womb . <p> III <p> It 's two months now since your six-foot fence went up . Two months , more or less . From my bed I can hear your children playing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to drown them out . It 's a terrible thing to feel yourself hate a child . <p> Sam did n't want to go to work today , but I argued him out the door . <p> Nothing will be improved by your losing your job , I said . <p> He drives my car these days . It was always the more dependable one . It 's parked down the drive , near the street , of course-thanks to you . His is stowed in our garage . He objected when I first told him he should take my keys . We went through the game of my telling him not to be silly . It would just be until I felt stronger . It was n't a big decision at all . Stop being ridiculous , I said . You look like you 're murdering me . It 's just the better car . You should use it while I ca n't . I 'll be taking it back soon enough . <p> And so he gave in . <p> I know that you go to work a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignition . I know the hours that you keep , can predict when you 'll come home . And I know you have a wife . A friend who visits me-brings us food , brings me gossip-has told me that your wife is very pretty , slender and natural blond , in her thirties . She stands on the corner in the morning and puts your daughter on the bus . Then an older woman comes in and watches your little boy while your wife keeps herself busy , though no one in the neighborhood knows exactly what she does . <p> There are speculations about you . The new family on the block . There are rumors that you 're putting in a pool . But winter is coming now , I know , and it is n't the right time . Maybe in April , when the world has thawed again so the ground will be soft enough to dig . <p> Sam drives out alone to Lawrence House now , every two or three days . <p> My last trip was two weeks ago . I said my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were other periods when I was n't there . There 's no way to explain to my child that this is different . And probably no reason that we should , though I still carry this awful fear that he 'll think , in whatever way he thinks , that I have given up on him . <p> I held his heavy head one last time , pulled it gently to my chest , no longer soft . <p> That day , in the car driving home , Sam was unusually talkative , telling me stories about a new coworker , and then about an old friend . Both of them had done hilarious things-as though everyone Sam knew had taken on an antic side , every situation holding a fistful of punch lines to be delivered . <p> And it was funny , genuinely funny . I laughed out loud as he drove us both home . <p> I do n't drink anymore . I lost the craving . But Sam brings the bottle upstairs now , and he sits by the bed . Sometimes we watch television . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the understanding that I 'm not keeping track . I pick through our lives , recounting good moments-like looking for treasures at the flea market . He listens , sometimes even smiles . <p> I know you must have heard by now that I 'm sick . It 's that kind of town , that kind of neighborhood . Our story-the boy who was born so damaged , the mother who wo n't make it to the spring-it 's all well known . We 're the kind of family people talk about . <p> Sam phones me from the office to let me know he 'll be late because he 's visiting Todd . I tell him that 's just as well . I 'm feeling tired . But by the time he gets home , I say , I 'll be awake . <p> I say it , but who really knows ? <p> The clock has lost its meaning . My relationship with time is more personal now . <p> Just take care of yourself , he says . I hate to have you there alone . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go on the stairs . <p> I wo n't go on the stairs . I wo n't even go to the bathroom . I wo n't get up . I 'll just rest . <p> Just take care . <p> Just . <p> It 's a word we use a lot now-but in only one way that we might , as though we have lost our knowledge of the other possibility . <p> Just be careful . I 'll just do this tiny thing . Just move my pillows a little higher up . Just do n't worry . Just be good to yourself . Just take care . <p> If you 'd just moved the damned fence just a foot ... <p> It was the little note of grace that we both needed then . <p> I sometimes think that when I 'm gone Sam will drive his car right into your well-constructed fence . I can picture it so easily , Sam behind the wheel pulling up into the drive , then gunning it , and veering left . If the tables were turned , there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is there left to be angry at ? But you ? <p> We used up all the other obvious candidates long ago . <p> When he gets home , Sam climbs heavily to our room , the scotch bottle and a glass in his hand . I have been dozing but am now awake . <p> I hope he feels bad about what he did , he says . <p> If he were the type to feel bad , I say , speaking slowly , he would n't have done it in the first place . If he cared a tiny bit about us and our lives , he would n't have acted as he did . He 's indifferent to us . It had all been decided before we met . There was never any hope . <p> I do n't tell him about these now fading fantasies of mine . The ones that started early on . About trying to reason with you . Trying to make you believe in my life . The simple fact of my existence . I do n't tell him that . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see things that were invisible to me before . <p> Sam sits there and he drinks , a flush beginning to spread through his cheeks . <p> He 's indifferent ? he asks . Is that really what it is ? <p> There is a universe of sorrow , wide and dark , in my husband 's staring eyes . An eternity built there , constructed over time , forged gradually of the realization that this is in fact our lives . This is what we have been dealt . <p> It 's possible , I say to him , that you were right . What you said about some folks just being bad . <p> But as I speak , I realize how little I want to say what I have learned . How reluctant I am to admit to Sam what indifference truly means , and has long meant to us both . I do not want to play a role in confirming that cruel universe that dwells inside my husband 's eyes . But I do love him . I do . I love him very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . <p> Author Affiliation
