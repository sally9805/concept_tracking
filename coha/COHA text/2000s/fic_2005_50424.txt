Rod Garcia introduced us to the fantasy world of Markovy back in the August 2000 issue , and in the past years he has spun out half a dozen tales of brave knights , invisible lasses , death-dealing goddesses , and unusual romances . Here we bring you more grand adventure in Mr. Garcia 's full-blooded style . You 'll recognize characters in this story from " Killer of Children " ( Dec. 2003 ) and other stories in this series , but if you have n't read one before , you should have no trouble picking things right up . <p> Bordering on the Baits are the nations of Estonia . They resemble the Baits in every way but one-women are the ruling sex . Which shows their fall , not just below freedom , but beneath even decent slavery . - Tacitus , Germania SINGING TREE PRINCESS ANNYA WENT into the autumn woods with a heavy heart , her steel ax in hand , searching amid splashes of fall color for a singing tree . At twenty , Annya was tall and blonde , strong of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monumentally sad , going into the woods trailed by silent ladies-in-waiting wearing funeral black . Her stepfather had fallen in battle , cut down by the Knights of the Sword , and his body had been returned to Zilvinas castle that very morning by frightened , defeated retainers . Knowing the Knights of the Sword , they would be along soon to complete their victory , looting and murdering , then converting any survivors to the love of Christ . Before that happened , Annya meant to see her stepfather 's soul was at peace . White birches crowded in around her , tall and slim as grown maidens crowned with leaves of gold . These young trees shooting up into the October light were not what Annya wanted . Signaling silently to her ladies , she pressed deeper into the woods , to where the tall mature trees towered over dark moist forest floor . Green gleaming moss clung to the north side of gnarled trunks , and birds called between the branches letting the woods know that they were coming . Ahead Annya saw a teenage fungus gatherer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Post-pubescent virgins and trained pigs were especially adept at sniffing out truffles . Seeing the women in black approaching , led by the Lady of Zilvinas wearing her silver and amber crown , the pig-girl dropped to her knees , asking , " How may I serve m'lady ? " Annya asked the girl , " What is your name ? " " Zenta , " replied the teenager , nervous in the presence of Princess Annya , who was a Valkyrie - literally a " Chooser of the Slain " - with the power of life and death over lowly pig-girls . Maiden sacrifices were rare , but not unknown , and these were troubled times , when folks needed heaven 's attention . The women 's funeral black might easily be for her . Annya bade the worried fungus gatherer rise , saying , " Fear not . We are searching for a singing tree . " Nodding happily , the teenager in the bright embroidered dress rose . " I know just the tree , my lady . " Hauling her reluctant pig behind her , Zenta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then up a low moraine ridge topped by boulders to a centuries old oak , alive with songbirds and hung with mistletoe . Home to myriad bugs , squirrels , and birds , such royal oaks were the heart of the forest . Zenta 's pig nosed about the roots , sniffing for fallen acorns . Casting a circle , Annya had her ladies kneel and pray , thanking the tree for its food and spreading shelter , apologizing in advance for taking its wood . Then Annya climbed atop a boulder and cut a lower branch from the living tree . Birds flew at every blow , twittering overhead . When the branch came crashing down , Annya thanked the tree again , and her ladies took up the fallen limb . As they descended the moraine , birds settled back into the royal oak , still crying angrily . Which was why Annya did not hear the danger coming , not until she was recrossing the stream and heard a squirrel making the man-call . She thought it might be for her , until she heard horses splashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Annya told her , " Horsemen are coming . Take a warning to the castle . " Without saying a word , the young woman let go of the limb , hiked up her black skirts and ran , disappearing into dense foliage upstream . Annya signaled the others to follow her up the stream bank , heading back the way they came . Thanks to Zenta their number was still a sacred nine , and whoever was coming would never suspect a lady-in-waiting was missing . Horsemen caught up with them in a clearing close to the stream . Fearing it would be Knights of the Sword , Annya was surprised to see a mounted ensign in the lead , wearing half-armor and bearing the Pair-of-Doves banner of Prince Nikolas of Pzkov . Yet another of her enemies . Behind him came a half-dozen mounted spearmen from the Pzkov militia , wearing studded leather and wide excited grins/happy to have stumbled on young unarmed women . Bright blood on their spears , and dead chickens thrust in their belts , showed they had been looting and killing downstream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer . Taking that as an invitation , several spearmen spurred their mounts , using their weapons to hem the women in . One seized the rope leash tied to Zenta 's pig , starting a tug of war . Laughing at the pig-girl 's show of resistance , two men immediately dismounted , seizing Zenta from behind , pinning her arms . Princess Annya stepped up and told the mounted ensign , " These are my women , and under my protection . " He seemed shocked she spoke Markovite , thinking forest folk grunted like their pigs . His surcoat stank of smoke , and he leered down at her , saying , " My lady is mistaken . Both these swine belong to my men . " His men hooted , happy to have the girl and her pig . Gleefully the spearmen tore off Zenta 's colorful embroidered dress , expertly pulled her linen slip up over her head , so the struggling teenager was both bare and blinded . Plainly they had done this before . Their leader applauded the performance , then turned back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , belong to me . " " I do ? " Annya looked evenly up at him , keeping watch on Zenta out the corner of her eye . Exposed and helpless , the girl began to shake . " Unless you hide some unfortunate blemish , " declared the prince 's ensign . " Strip her too . I want a look at my prize . " Unbelievable arrogance . This Markovite ensign had not even asked her name , though she was the Lady of Zilvinas and worth a mountain of squirrel skins in ransom . All he cared about was her body - a backhand compliment of sorts . Princesses seldom knew what men truly thought of them . Spearmen swung out of the saddle , eager to lay hands on her , but Annya was no scared virgin and much preferred undressing herself . Stepping closer , she smiled up at the ensign , saying , " If you want to see me naked , that is easily done . " He stayed his men , and Princess Annya took her royal time stripping , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her silver crown , she handed it to a worried lady-in-waiting , followed by her amber necklace . Then Annya undid the laces on her black dress , one at a time . Spearmen leaned in their saddles to get a better look , and those on the ground stopped groping the girl . Untying the last lace , Annya dropped her dress , stepping out in just her yellow Cathayan silk slip , embroidered with crimson flowers and brought by caravan over the Roof of the World . Spearmen cheered , shouting , " Show us the rest . Strip " em all . " Annya paused , pointedly ignoring the shouts , playing her audience , determined to have their total attention . Slowly crossing her arms , she grabbed the silk at her waist , drawing the slip up gradually , feeling cool fabric climb her calf . Men leaned farther forward , eager to see what pagan princesses wore beneath their Cathayan silk . In Annya 's case , nothing much , just a blue butterfly tattoo . Fabric went past her knees and up her thighs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Annya had not been naked before so many men since the last summer solstice . Men cheered the sight of her pubic triangle , followed by her belly button , then her breasts . She finished with a flourish , flicking her thick blond hair aside as she whipped the slip off over her head , drawing still more cheers . Handing her yellow slip to a lady-in-waiting , Annya stepped into the center of the clearing , and did a leisurely pirouette wearing nothing but her tattoo and smile . As she did , bowmen in skins and leather stepped out of the woods around them - but not a single Markovite noticed , happily staring at her long white body , broken only by a patch of golden hair and the blue butterfly hovering above her heart . When the ensign saw what was going on , his outnumbered men were already being disarmed . Looking about , he fumbled for his sword and demanded , " What is happening ? " " You are being taken prisoner , " Annya replied , though it should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pztov , " declared the startled Markovite , as if that somehow precluded his capture . " No , you are not . " She gave her blond hair another shake , stayed his sword hand with her touch , and said , " You belong to me now . " Men in skins stepped up , seized his reins , took the sword , and shoved bent bows in his face , their black iron arrows barbed and ready . Some had green boughs about their heads and shoulders , so they could not be seen crouching in the woods . Her head huntsman knelt at her feet , gleefully doffing his leafy hat . " Your highness , we heard their cheering a hundred paces off , and snared them before they ever knew it . " Annya frowned down at her retainer in skins , saying , " Did you have to wait until I was naked ? " " Absolutely , your highness . " He grinned eagerly up at her , eyes level with her crotch . " My men would not have moved a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Annya sighed . " Do not harm them , especially the ensign . He is mine . " Ladies-in-waiting were impatient to dress their princess , though she now had nothing left to hide . Annya had them bring the tear-stained Zenta to her instead , and the fungus gatherer knelt before her , wearing her linen shift and clutching her pig 's leash and her shredded dress . She wanted the girl to see they had both been shamed , and could both be made better . " Thank you , Zenta , for showing me the singing tree . If ever you need anything of me , come to Zilvinas on my audience day and ask . " Wiping her eyes , the pig-girl smiled up at the princess . Only then did Annya let them dress her . Then her ladies-in-waiting picked up the branch from the singing tree , and they set off for Zilvinas , winding through the woods with the protesting Markovites mounted backwards and tied to their saddles . Zilvinas castle stood on an island in a boggy stretch of the Daugava @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causeway . Timber ramparts ringed a tall stone keep built by Polish masons from gray Estonian limestone , and a log boom between the castle and an outlying tower controlled traffic up and down the Daugava , the Holy Mother River that divided the forest lands in half , connecting Markovy to the Amber coast , and the Baltic beyond . Annya 's stepfather had built all this , and now he lay dead in the great hall , a huge log house , its low eaves carved with serpents in honor of the keep 's namesake , Zilvinas , King of the Grass Snakes . As soon as she arrived , Annya went to kneel beside her stepfather 's body , which lay in full armor on a bier of aromatic wood surrounded by burning incense . Clasped in the dead man 's hands was a slim brass cylinder with curved glass at both ends , a Cathayan far-seeing tube , given to him by Lady Kore , Demi-Goddess of Death - now it was going back to its owner . She told him what had happened in the wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest when she came to that part . " Here is an enemy banner to take to the Underworld . Your foes remain my foes , and I will keep fighting them . " Annya had barely known her own father , and in the years since her mother died , her stepfather had been her parent and mentor , ruling in her name . During her minority this seemed perfectly natural , since he was the father who raised and protected her . When she became a woman , things got more complicated . She was Lady of Zilvinas , and he was Lord Regent - but only so long as Annya did not marry . Forest folk figured inheritance through the mother , so whoever Annya married was immediately Prince of Zilvinas . Neither Annya nor her stepfather ever saw anyone they wanted in his place . Instead he kept a loose rein on her , raising Annya like a boy , free to find love without marrying . Which Annya took as permission to do as she willed , enjoying being the young and beautiful Lady of Zilvinas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over . Her protector was dead , and Knights of the Sword would toss her into some German nunnery , or just burn her at the stake . Or she might disappear into a Markovite harem . None of which much appealed to Annya . She thought how firm her world had been scant days ago and thanked her stepfather . " Bless you for watching over me when I was a motherless child . I remember all you have taught me , and will try to make you proud . " In a corner of the hall , a craftsman was carving the limb from the singing tree , making a sounding board for a " kahnklis " - an ancient stringed instrument that absorbed the soul of the dead , and the sorrow of the family , turning it into a sonorous sound . She kissed her dead stepfather on the lips , then left to see to the defense of Zilvinas . From the top of the stone keep , Annya got a sweeping view over the sea of trees , saw columns of smoke rising in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villages , pushing up the Daugava from their fortress at Riga . Lucjan Jakosz , her Polish mercenary captain , was with her , wearing dented plate armor and a worried look ; he had brought her stepfather 's body back when her own people fled into the forest . Going down on an armored knee , her Pole-for-hire wearily explained , " We were winning . Those square-head knights are vicious , but stupid . We ambushed them at a pass between wood and water , penning them like stags in a buckstall . Their Estonian infantry scattered , and will not stop running until they get to Riga .... " " So how did my father die ? " Annya asked , wishing all her enemies were headed back to Riga . " Against my advice , Prince Zilvinas mounted up and led a counter charge . When we got to cleared ground the German knights rallied and turned on us , easily riding down our half-armed infantry . " Captain Jakosz could not hide his contempt for forest folk , who went into battle wearing leather and armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering the retreat . Only nightfall kept us all from being taken . " More than nightfall was needed to save them now . Princess Annya bid her captain rise , saying , " So , what is to be done ? " Jakosz smiled at his blond young mistress . " My lady could come back to Krakow with me . Happily I have invested my earnings in a handsome villa that .... " Annya had heard this all before , and was not about to run off with some paid swordsman , especially a married one . " What will your wife say ? " " You mean Maria ? " He acted like he had forgotten his faraway spouse and children - two sons and a daughter . " Why does Her Highness care ? Whatever she says will be in Polish . " Captain Jakosz was smart , strong and handsome , and in her heart Princess Annya had utter contempt for Christian marriage . But she was not going to Krakow just to play the pagan whore before disapproving Poles . She wanted a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not someone who would pen her in a foreign harem , then turn her out when he tired of her . " Hate can be heard cold and clear , even in Polish . What is the chance your wife will welcome me with a kiss ? " Her captain replied with a sour smile . " We had better take our chances with the Knights of the Sword . " German crusaders on horseback could not hope to match the anger of a Polish hausfrau who had not seen her wandering husband for two years or more . Annya studied the smoke rising to the west . " How soon before the Knights of the Sword arrive ? " " Three , maybe four days , " her captain hazarded . " We can delay them with forest traps and barricades , and by breaking down bridges at the fords . But Markovites have already come over the borders to join in the plunder , and will be here even sooner . Baron Mikhail of Karasalva is marching against us , and so is Baron Polotzk , bringing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Annya added thoughtfully . Captain Jakosz looked surprised . " How did my lady know ? " Princess Annya tried to sound nonchalant . " I captured one of his ensigns this morning . " " Jesus , " her captain responded with a Christian oath . " That is astounding , and the only banner we have taken . How did Your Highness ever do it ? " Annya shrugged . " You will soon know all the details . " Tonight the castle would talk of nothing else . Captain Jakosz cocked an eye at her . " Sounds like a royal escapade . " Being a man and a Pole , he did not hesitate to correct his princess . " Holy Mary , my lady exposes herself needlessly . " " Nonsense , " Annya snorted . " Just when the need arises . " She informed the impudent Pole that his audience was at an end . For two more days her stepfather lay in his hall , ringed by burning incense , and each day Annya brought her problems to the corpse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul stayed with the body as long as it lay in state . But on the third day it was time to return his body to Lady Kore . Stripped of his armor , the Prince of Zilvinas was laid on a painted wagon , still clutching his Cathayan far-seeing tube . Dressed in funeral black , Annya had Prince Nikolas 's ensign brought to her . Naked to the waist , with his hands bound behind him and a rope halter about his neck , the proud Markovite still wore his gold trousers and leather knee-high boots . He asked her , " Has my prince arrived ? " " He is on his way , " Annya replied solemnly . " Excellent , " the ensign declared . " I can arrange a parlay . " " I will do that on my own . " Annya did not mean for this ensign to present her case . " His Highness will be wroth if he learns you have mistreated me , " the ensign warned . " Have we mistreated you ? " Annya asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Food was dull , yet plentiful , while the servers were young and pretty . I have suffered worse . " " Good , " Annya said , and ordered his halter tied to the rear of the painted wagon , so he could walk in her stepfather 's wake . Princess Annya took her own place in the front of the painted wagon , which was drawn by cows yoked together . Her ladies-in-waiting led the funeral wagon out the castle gate , and across the long causeway , singing a slow dirge while forest folk watched in silence . All weapons and iron were locked away , all fires put out , so that the Prince of Zilvinas might depart in peace . Dragged along behind the wagon , Prince Nikolas 's ensign complained woefully in Markovite , which hardly anyone understood . On the far side of the causeway , her ladies guided the wagon along a forest track that led to a sacred lake . No forest folk dared follow the funeral wagon into the realm of death . At the lake shore Princess Annya descended from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winged shapes circled overhead , a half-dozen huge raptors slowly spiraling down from the clouds toward the lake surface . Horrified , the Markovite ensign called out to her , " What are those ? Vultures ? Rocs ? " Annya did not answer , being deep in her prayers . Dark shapes spiraled closer , and the ensign asked plaintively , " Are you feeding me to these vultures ? " She finished her prayer , walked over to the funeral wagon , and took the farseeing Cathayan tube from her dead stepfather 's hands . Then she turned to the terrified ensign . " They are Valkyries , not vultures . " " Dear God , " the ensign pleaded , falling to his knees , " please do not give me to them . " " They are not coming for you , " Annya told him curtly . " They are coming for a hero who fought to save his people . " She reminded the bound and begging ensign , " You are a man who sacked three cottages , killed four men , repeatedly raped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . " Forest folk had brought in the bodies , and the ravished women , begging for vengeance . Some might add lese majesty to the list , for making a princess strip before strangers , but Annya forgave him for that , trying never to be vindictive in word or in deed . " We were at war , " the Markovite protested , as if that excused everything . " We are still at war , " she said . " I just wanted you to know why I chose you . " " Chose me ? For what ? " Annya turned back to the lake shore to greet the first of the descending shadows . With a thunderous flutter of feathers , a twelve-foot-tall female roc landed between them and the lake . Riding on the back of the huge raptor was a small raven-haired woman , wearing a leather flying jacket and pink harem pants . Venom rings shone on her fingers , showing her touch was death . Annya fell to her knees before the Queen of the Valkyries , offered up the farseeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hail Kore , Lady Death , Dark Daughter of the Goddess-on-Earth . Here is the magic scepter of the Princes of Zilvinas , given to them by the Allmother , that they might see better . " Lady Death took the brass tube , looked over at the kneeling Markovite , and asked , " Who is he ? " Annya rose , went to the wagon and got the banner that lay on the dead man 's chest , giving the battle flag to the Dark Daughter . " He is a bannerman for Prince Nikolas of Pztok , taken with innocent blood on his hands . " " What are you saying ? " demanded the ensign , who did not speak the Old Tongue , but knew they were talking about him . " You have chosen well , " Lady Death decided , and signaled with the scepter . With another thunder of wings , a second roc swooped down , and the ensign screamed in terror . Ignoring his shriek , the giant bird seized the corpse of Prince Zilvinas from the funeral wagon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Markovite whimpering beside a painted wheel . Lady Death handed the farseeing scepter back to Annya . " I leave it to you to choose the next Prince of Zilvinas , though it will surely be difficult . " Princess Annya gratefully accepted back the scepter . " Thank you , Dark Daughter . I will strive to choose wisely . " For a long moment the two young women looked at each other . Lady Death was only a few years older , as dark as Annya was light , and both of them were Valkyries , choosers of the slain . Like all pagan gods , Lady Death was mortal , and would one day die herself . Trained from girlhood to be Dark Daughter , she knew how it felt to be dedicated to something beyond her . All Kore could say to Annya was , " Living is harder than dying . " Annya kissed Lady Death on the lips , saying , " Thank you for taking our prince . " Kore flew off , with the Prince of Pzkov 's banner flapping in the breeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thermal off the dark woods , all following the roc with the corpse in her claws . Watching them go , Annya hoped the Dark Daughter came for her when she died . Only not this Dark Daughter . Her daughter perhaps , or better yet , a granddaughter . Walking back over to the wagon , she bade her women rise , and told the ensign , " Come , we must be cleansed . " Her ladies stepped up and stripped off his trousers , which did not please the man as much as one might expect . Eyeing the frigid water warily , the ensign asked , " Would not a sauna be better ? " Saying nothing , Annya disrobed along with her women , and they rolled the wagon down to the lake , with the ensign still tied to the rear . First they washed the wagon , then the nude women gave Annya and the ensign a slow ritual washing in the frigid water , drawing more complaints from the Markovite . " Shush , " she told him . " This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washing , two of the women tied an anchor stone to the halter rope , and the ensign shouted in horror , begging them to stop and calling out to God . Princess Annya and her women seized hold of the halter rope , dragging him into deeper water . Shouts turned to gasps and screams as the water went over his head . He thrashed a bit beneath the surface , kicking and splashing , but soon succumbed to the icy lake water . Lady Death herself had approved his choice , but being a Markovite he could not appreciate the honor . At least he called on his god . Which was good , since Annya had not , and she wanted everyone in heaven to see his end - but most of all the souls of those he killed . Wading ashore , Princess Annya and her ladies dried off , dressed , prayed , then led the cow-drawn funeral wagon back to Zilvinas castle . No one looked at them as they returned , or asked where the ensign had gone . PRINCE NIKOLAS WITHIN THE WEEK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Teutonic Knights out to win her people 's sinful heathen souls for the Pope , and Markovite boyars eager to loot what was left . Standing on the keep gatehouse , in the shadow of a catapult sighted down the causeway , Captain Jakosz introduced Princess Annya to her foes through the farseeing tube . " The knight in white with the cross on his chest , that is the Grand Master of the Knights of the Sword . " " Seems somewhat wide for the saddle , " Annya observed , peering through the Cathayan tube . She had it focused on a knot of nobles who had come up the causeway as far as the first drawbridge to view the castle defenses . " Fighting monks do run to fat , " Jakosz admitted . " Comes of having naught to do on winter evenings but eat , drink , and thump the choir boys . Women are what makes a man miss meals . " Loyalty to Princes Annya already had Captain Jakosz living on salt fish and acorn meal . She shifted the glass , asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birds on his chest ? " Jakosz did not bother to look . " That would be Prince Nikolas of Pzkov , and the birds are his twin doves . You met his ensign earlier . " She had last seen the doves on the prince 's banner , being borne away by Lady Death . She shifted the spyglass again . " What about the shifty-looking boyar with the straggly beard ? " " Sounds like Baron Karaslava . Must m'lady judge her enemies just by their looks ? " His tone implied that women must take war more seriously . " How am I to judge them ? " she asked tartly . " By their deplorable deeds ? By the Cross of Christ on their shields ? Or the birds of peace on their armor ? " Captain Jakosz admitted that looks were as good as anything at this point . " So the white-bearded gaffer on a bad horse would be Baron Polotsk .... " " And the slovenly fellow next to him ? " Annya asked . " Dressed like a used dung salesman ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arrayed behind the leaders were their men , crusading knights bearing blood-red crosses , backed by sullen Estonian infantry dressed in animal skins , and carrying spears and axes . The Markovite militia looked little happier in rusty mail and wet leather , armed with long pikes , not the ideal weapon for forest fighting . Catholics and Markovites had been under mutual writs of excommunication since the Dark Ages , but could still take time out of their holy feud to abuse the forest folk . Christians did not scare Annya half so much as the boyar 's Kazak bodyguards , skilled horse archers , far deadlier than mounted monks or homesick militia . She hoped they would not be at their best in the woods . " Shall I give them your regards ? " Jakosz asked . She nodded , telling the Pole to do his worst . Captain Jakosz had spent his spare time sighting the counter-weighted catapult , which was set to land liquid-filled pots of uniform size just beyond the far drawbridge . He gave a wave and the catapult fired , sending a pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nobles at the end of the bridge . Princess Annya watched their reactions through the farseeing tube . Prince Nikolas of Pzkov saw the missile coming , shouting an alarm and spurring his mount . Baron Karaslava shied back in horror , running afoul of the militia spearmen behind him . Old Baron Polotsk sat in frozen terror , watching the pot fall toward them , while the Grand Master of the Sword did not speak Markovite and could not tell what was happening . The surprised German was still looking wildly about when the pot hit . Impact shattered the pot , splashing flaming liquid in all directions . Horses reared and riders went flying , arms flailing and surcoats on fire . Prince Nikolas escaped the worst of it , riding straight off the open drawbridge , plunging on horseback into the river . Baron Karaslava ended up in the water as well , thrown clear of the saddle and tumbling down the bank into the bog . Knights of the Sword leaped on their Grand Master , rolling his armored body in the dirt to put out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jakosz sent another firepot sailing after the first , followed by a third and a fourth . All of them landed within a few paces of each other , turning the far end of the causeway into an inferno and scattering the surviving attackers . Most made their way quickly to the mainland , except for Prince Nikolas , clinging to his foundering mount , while the current carried them toward the main channel . " Seize him , " Captain Jakosz shouted , forgetting he was not actually in command , carried away by the chance to grab a prince . " Get him when he hits the boom . " Men with nets were already on the log boom , not needing a Pole to tell them their business . How many fishermen got to snag a Markovite prince ? But at the last moment , Prince Nikolas managed to seize a passing snag , and pull his armored body to safety . seeing him get away , Princess Annya rose on her toes , shouting , " Save the horse ! " Prince Nikolas 's horse , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boom . Having missed the prince , the men redoubled their efforts and managed to catch the splashing stallion , hauling the terrified struggling horse up onto the log boom . Cheers erupted from the ramparts , and men set out in skin boats from the castle end of the causeway , hoping to catch the prince as well . But Prince Nikolas of Pzkov saw the skin boats coming . He stripped off his mail armor and leaped from the snag , swimming away before the boats arrived . Arrows from the skin boats hit the river around him . Through the spyglass , Annya saw him make the shore , proving Prince Nikolas was strong as well as agile , and no easy man to drown . It was unfortunate that he got away . Of all her enemies , Prince Nikolas was the one she would most like to get her hands on . At least she had his horse . She examined the wet , frightened charger in the main bailey , finding him a horse fit for a prince , with big powerful quarters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brabants were descended from the ancient forest horses of Europe ( Equus silvaticus , the massive mounts that impressed Caesar during his conquest of Gaul . She saw that the stallion was thoroughly dried , then calmed him down as best she could with warm praise and a bunch of carrots . Captain Jakosz helped her tame her new mount , immensely proud of his pyrotechnics which required exactly sighting the catapult and taking numerous practice shots . " Pity we missed the prince . That was bound to be our best shot at him . " Too true . No one was going to gather at the end of the causeway again just to gawk . Princess Annya used the privacy to get acquainted with her new stallion , which she named Tartar . Turning the inner ward into a maidan , she exercised her new mount , getting him used to her , and handfeeding him treats . Captain Jakosz thought it an extravagance . " Horses are not much good in a siege . We will just end up eating them . " " Then we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeding Tartar a sweet beet , pleased to have made a friend . Knights of the Sword soon cut the castle 's supply line , rowing barges up the Daugava , with wet hide barricades in the bow to keep off flaming naptha . Archers firing from behind the soaked hides cleared the log boom of defenders . Annya watched from the keep ramparts , wearing plate armor to protect her from stray arrows . Her suit came off a dead Pole , a young mercenary who died of gangrene . Despite being cut down to fit her , the armor was confining , and clearly not made for a woman . But Annya had to get used to it , since even the castle ramparts were no longer safe . Soon it would be wear armor , or live underground . With her visor up , she saw row barges grapple the boom , letting Knights of the Sword clamber onto the logs , covered by the archers . Catapults sighted on the boom , kept the knights away from the castle , but that was not their objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to storm the small outlying tower anchoring the far end of the boom . Cut off from the castle , the bowmen in the tiny tower flung fire pots at their attackers , but had no hope of holding off heavily armed knights , backed by archers in the barges . Annya held her breath , seeing the first ladder put against the tower , and watching the knights start climbing up . She told Captain Jakosz , " Signal the tower . " " With pleasure . " Lifting his steel-gauntleted hand , the Pole had one of his men wave a crimson flag , getting an answering wave from the tower . When the flags went down , men in the castle and tower released each end of the log boom . Ladders tumbled into the Daugava , taking men-at-arms with them , and two score Knights of the Sword found themselves floating downriver on the liberated boom . Banging into barges , and partly afire , the log barrier picked up speed while starting to unravel , losing logs to the current . Unable to swim , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Riga , with chaos in their wake . Amusing as this was , loss of the boom meant they could no longer stop the knights from rowing upstream , cutting the castle off from the forest that supplied it . seeing galleys and row barges go past the castle , Captain Jakosz concluded , " They will be raiding all the way up to Karaslava . " Within a day the Pole was proven right , as smoke rose from upriver hamlets . Now the siege would begin in earnest , with Zilvinas castle living off its stores , and the invaders subsisting on what they could loot and steal . Which meant Annya had to make hard decisions . Forest folk and villagers who had taken shelter in the castle were no longer safe , so skin boats ferried them across the Daugava , to seek shelter deeper in the woods . Horses and prisoners were another extravagance Zilvinas could not afford , so she called her Polish cavalry commander in for a private conference . For the first time , Captain Jakosz got a peek at her room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom , half aviary , filled with carved and painted birds , and real ones as well , not caged but living in little handpainted houses , and in tidy nests in the eaves . Doves cooed among the serpent-shaped rafters , and house wrens flitted about , pooping on the Persian carpets . Annya 's outfit matched the decor , a jade green silk robe embroidered with birds , snakes , and flowers . " Most amazing , " the Pole said . He was dressed in parti-colored hose and a silver-trimmed jacket . " It must be like living in a tree . " " Thank you . " That was the effect intended . Her maternal grandmother was actually born in a tree . " Forest folk never like being far from the woods . " Jakosz nodded as though he understood , and maybe he did . This Pole did not need to be here , since he had a villa and a wife outside Krakow . Her stepfather retained him to raise a troop of armored cavalry - but her stepfather was dead , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in squirrel skins . " And now we are cut off from the woods , " she reminded him . " We can not get fodder for the horses , or spare food for prisoners . " " What does m'lady suggest ? " Jakosz was leaving it up to her , not having lifted a finger to save Prince Nikolas 's ensign . She studied her Polish captain carefully . " We could solve two problems at once ; if you took the horses and prisoners to Prince Nikolas . " " What do you mean ? " Even crafty Captain Jakosz had not seen that coming . " You could change sides , " Annya suggested , " taking the Markovite prisoners to show your good intentions . " " Why in heaven would I do that ? " " Because Prince Nikolas would pay and feed you , much more easily than I could . " Annya hated to see her strong stalwart captain go , but she could no longer keep him . Her captain looked torn , saying , " It is not easy to serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled , and took his hand . " Do not even try . Serve the man who pays you - just think well of me when you do . " To make sure he did feel fondly toward her , she sealed the suggestion with a kiss . Captain Jakosz kissed back , and , being married , he knew how to do it , drawing out the first tender moment of contact . First kisses are to be savored , especially when they may be last ones as well . When he finished , he told her , " My greatest regret on leaving your employ is never getting to see m'lady naked . " " You should have come to the spring orgies . " She leaned lightly against him , letting him feel some of what he missed . " Or to solstice eve . " " M'lady forgets , I am Christian . " His hands slid inside her silk robe , starting to do ungodly things to her pagan body . " And a married one too . " Apparently Christian marriage was not as binding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dreary religion . " She pressed herself harder against him , feeling his fingertips descending her thigh . " Everything fun seems to be a sin . " He admitted it was so . " No human sacrifice . No fertility rites . Not even divorce . Hardly any sex . " " Until you get to heaven ? " So far as Annya could see , heaven was what kept Christianity going - an eternity of orgiastic bliss made up for the religion 's failures and shortcomings here on Earth . " No , that is the Muslims . Christians can not have sex in heaven . " His hand pushed between her thighs , fingers finding the perfect spot . " So we must do it here . " Annya was scandalized , closing her thighs on his hand , drawing the fingers in deeper . " That is what comes of praying to an impotent Pope . " " Celibate , " Captain Jakosz protested , " not impotent . " Whatever the word was , this Pole did not have that problem , feeling stiff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pray to him . " Jakosz added , correcting a common misconception among pagans and Markovites . " Maybe not , yet you still put far too much faith in the notions of a silly old man who has forgotten what a woman even feels like . " If he ever knew . " Undoubtedly true . " Her Christian captain was finding it devilish hard to heed the Pope 's opinions , with a half-naked pagan princess squirming in his arms . Marriage vows were a mere memory . Shrugging off the rest of her robe , she told him , " Tomorrow we will be enemies , so let us spend one last night as friends . " Her former employee pressed her down onto the bed , climbing eagerly atop her . Severance pay was seldom so sweet . Captain Jakosz was getting a free evening with a beautiful young princess , and no worries about the morrow , since Annya knew herself well enough to pick a night when she would not conceive . Her only child was a son who had died before he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make another yet . She just wanted to say good-bye to a brave and stalwart Pole , who would have eaten his own horses rather than give her to her foes . Her body was all she had left to reward him with . Plus she wanted her captain from Krakow to take fond memories of her into the enemy camp . On the morrow they awoke to bird song , and Captain Jakosz asked her lovingly , " Do you still want me to leave ? " " Absolutely . " Not awfully flattering , but the truth . If he stayed it would be a losing battle . She would not have him at her side just to see him eat horsemeat , then die defending her . " That way you at least can be safe . " He kissed the curve of her throat , reminding her , " It is not too late to come with me to Krakow . " " So your wife can serve us breakfast in the sheets ? " She would take her chances with the Knights of the Sword . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a caged pigeon , saying , " When you are safely accepted in Prince Nikolas 's camp , set her free and think of me . " Captain Jakosz laughed at the artless gift , just what you would expect from a forest witch . " What shall I tell Prince Nikolas about his missing ensign ? " " That is a woman 's secret . " Some things were not meant for Christian ears . Then he was gone , taking the captured Markovites with him , freeing two birds at one throw . Now her spearmen could hold out that much longer , eating the horses " oats and using the hay to fatten the castle 's cattle . Two days later , the pigeon returned , a good omen . Some men forget women once they have been intimate , eager to get on to the next one but clearly not Captain Jakosz . Witness his constant attempts to drag her home to his wife . Making love bound them closer , though right now Princess Annya felt more alone than ever . Since the day her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm , keeping his strong armored body between her and danger . Now she had to wear armor and face danger herself . Alas , naught else would do . That night she had a groom put an empty soup bowl over her head and cut her long blonde hair , shearing off every strand that showed . Then she loaded her big Brabant charger onto a makeshift raft , along with her suit of Polish armor . Fisher folk polled them across to the south bank of the Daugava , and in the darkness before dawn Princess Annya put on her plate armor , decorated with a red and white surcoat - Polish colors . Her favorite axe hung by a strap from her saddle . Fishermen offered to help her mount , but she waved them away , knowing she had to learn to get on and off the big charger , even encased in heavy armor . Every time she shifted her weight , the armor made a horrible racket , grating on ears bred to forest stillness . Yet she had to leave the safety of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not go armored , she would be prey to the first armed man that came along . To complete her disguise Princess Annya wore a crucifix around her neck , with the nailed-up Christ resting on her armored breast . Riding off under the trees , she felt free for the first time in weeks . Since she was a child , the forest had been her personal playground and domain , an endless green roofed hall all her own . No longer besieged and hemmed in , with a huge charger beneath her , and her body protected by steel , Princess Annya was finally freed to act . Surely she could find a way to save Zilvinas , and get her enemies headed for home . First she meant to go up the Daugava to Markovite territory , then cross over to the north bank , like any other Polish lance-for-hire . Before she even got to the first ford , she came on burnt-out hovels and abandoned farmsteads . Knights of the Sword had worked their way upriver , looting along the south bank , driving people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferry , forest folk were defenseless without the Zilvinas boom to shield them . And not just forest folk either , since this far east Markovites had moved in , coming downstream from Karaslava . At midmorning she came on the stands of stumps that bordered their settlements . Markovites themselves appeared , a party of woodcutters wearing shapeless smocks and leather serf collars , who eyed her suspiciously , men clutching their axes , women standing motionless with wood piled on their backs . Wearing a mail coif that covered her short hair and half her face . Annya counted on passing for a beardless lad in armor , so long as she acted the part . Asking in gruff Markovite how far to the ferry , she tried to sound like a lost and irritated Pole , who it was best to humor , if only to send on his way . Naturally suspicious of any foreigners , this family did not care if she was a girl or a gelding , saying , " Two leagues past the next ford . Germans have it now , m'lord . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which vastly irritated the Poles , and infuriated any French passing through . Princess Annya took it as a compliment to her disguise , and flipped the father a silver groat , which he went on his knees to get , groveling at her horse 's fetlocks . She could just as easily have given them nothing , or robbed them at sword point . Serfs were not allowed any weapons beyond a knife or axe , rendering them helpless before men-at-arms . Owning even a boar spear or hunting bow could cost a serf his hand . Shortly past noon she came on a hovel that was still smoldering , with its former owner hanging from a tree limb . At the next farmstead she found the knights themselves , a half-dozen lances , each knight having two mounted sergeants with him , making a score of mounted warriors wearing plate and mail , plus some Estonian scouts , forest archers from north of Riga . They had a pen full of prisoners , and were sorting through their catch , while the sergeants searched the huts , digging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bred , the Estonians saw her first . Luckily , all they could do was report her to their masters . If she had to fool forest folk , Annya would never have tried this deception - but Knights of the Sword were another matter . She tried to remember all she could about being a Christian . Annya knew some Polish , mostly picked up from her captain-cumlover , and that would be enough to fool these Germans , who knew even less . Latin was their common language , and she had to dredge up phrases drummed into her by a foreign tutor - but that just made her sound like some hayseed on horseback , fumbling in a foreign tongue . Every German 's image of the perfect Pole . And a pretty one at that . These were , after all , monks in armor . Leading the knights was an Undermaster in his thirties , clean shaven , with bright blue eyes and the broken nose of a veteran jouster . He greeted her pleasantly , " Good day , young sir . What brings you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear I have badly lost myself in the woods . " Annya knew she would do best by appealing to him as novice to priest . From what she knew of the knights " private lives , young initiates often attached themselves to senior members , who showed them the brotherhood 's most private secrets . " Would you know the way to the ferry ? " " Most certainly . " This Undermaster was plainly pleased with his pretty lost Pole . " My name is Brother Karlmagnus , but comrades call me Karl . " She nodded and smiled , like a compliant young Pole on the make , saying , " My name is Janik . " Adding softly , " From Krakow . " Totally taken in , Brother Karl asked , " Where are you headed ? " " North of the river . " She nodded toward the Daugava . " I came to convert the heathen . " He laughed at her high ambition , waved at his prisoner pen , " Here are your heathens - but you will want to wash them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen , along with what remained of the pigs . Most were forest folk , women and children caught up in the knight 's net , destined to be baptized , then sold on the Riga slave marts . With them were Markovites taken by mistake , or because Knights of the Sword saw no difference between Markovites and forest pagans . One Markovite was a man , bruised and naked , who had plainly resisted being snatched , but now stood in silence with his shivering hands cupped over his crotch . With him were a couple of serf families , still wearing their leather collars . So long as serfs went unarmed and collared , they were supposed to be left at peace , like eunuchs or priests . Certainly they could not be sold as slaves , since they already belonged to someone , but Brother Karl considered them the pick of the pigsty , calling a blond Markovite boy over , saying , " Look at this little angel here . " Running over and bowing low , the serf boy grinned up at them , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He has such natural grace , " the German rhapsodized , " to add to his musical voice . What is your name ? " " Peter , " replied the boy , adding musically , " May rats mate in m'lord 's skull . " " And a poetic soul , " Brother Karl pointed out . " He never answers without adding some foolish little soliloquy . " " Adorable , " Princess Annya agreed . Had the Undermaster known Markovite , he might have seen meaning in the poetry . Brother Karl waved the boy away . Peter did a bobbing , grinning bow , saying , " May His Assholyness rot headfirst in a privy . " Hiking up his smock , Peter went running off , while Brother Karl admired his bare legs and boundless energy . Having her own secrets to keep , not the least of which was knowing Markovite , Princess Annya saw no reason to betray Peter to the Undermaster . Besides , she too found the boy cute . When the looting was done , sergeants fired the huts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen , marched toward the ferry . Forest folk eyed the trees enviously , wanting to vanish into the greenery - but those who could run off were already gone . Those left were women with children , unlikely to outrun men on horseback . More accustomed to obedience , Markovites trudged head down , their gaze fixed on the road , except for Peter , who strutted happily along , basking in the Undermaster 's favor . At the stump field surrounding the Markovite Ferry , the prisoners were separated from their pigs , then herded into a slave pen just upstream from the river docks . Pigs squealed and children cried , rightly fearing what was coming . Once separated , the swine would be slaughtered , while the children were destined for the slave mart at Riga . Pleased with his catch , Brother Karl invited Princess Annya to enjoy pork dinner with him , saying , " This place is safe enough . We can take off our armor and relax , before crossing over to the north bank camps . " " Capital idea , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dodge the invitation . She was not about to disappoint Brother Karl by showing what hid behind her breastplate . " First I must water my horse , and see about the ferry . " " No need to be in a hurry . The ferry and camps will be there on the morrow . " Brother Karl plainly hated to see her go bounding off . " Foragers get the first pick . Here there is fresh fat pig to eat , all you will find in the besieging camps is thin soup and swamp fever . " Buoyed by that bit of happy news , Princess Annya promised to be back for her piece of fat pig . Then she went clanking down to the river , giving her horse a drink while she took a look at the ferry , finding it still in Markovite hands , with serfs working the poles for new masters . There were two big flat-bottomed barges , but one was laid up for repairs . Other than that there were just a couple of river skiffs tied up at the dock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted . Traffic on the upper river vanished once the Knights of the Sword broke through the Zilvinas boom . If she was going to cross , it must be here - but how ? Sergeants were watering the knights " horses , and she heard the squeal of a dying pig , echoed by children in the slave pen wailing for the family porker . Once the pig was swung over a blood bucket to drain , the sergeants tied up the horses and settled in to slaughter and cook the pig . Prayers were said , then wine skins went around the fire , and eventually the smell of roasted meat filled the air . When the first sizzling back ribs came off the fire , everyone relaxed , except for the Estonian scouts , sitting with bows strung , staring intently into the woods , knowing now was the time to attack . All they lacked was the direction . Princess Annya clanked back to where her charger was tied , and mounted up , ambling over to the slave pen . Undermaster Karl would be wondering where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Approaching the slave pen from upriver , she paused at the rear of the pen , speaking softly to a woman at the back , " Be ready to rush the gate . " Taken aback , the woman clearly did not know her princess , and wondered where this Pole learned to talk like a person ? Another compliment to her disguise . " Warn the others , " she whispered . " We are going back to the woods . " With a nod , the woman began to circulate , whispering her message . Princess Annya guided her mount around to the front of the pen and told the two sergeants on duty , " Meat is being cut , and the Undermaster says you may have as much as you can carry on a knife point . I am ordered to watch the pen . " Staring up at her , the guards hesitated , having seen this Pole flirting with their commander , but getting no formal orders . Annya added , " There is a wineskin waiting as well . Go send to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the saddle , she left the choice with them . Her sword was only for show , part of the costume ; she had never swung one except in play . An ax was something else . Shifting her reins to her left hand , she slid the ax strap off the saddle , slipping it around her right wrist . " Would not harm to ask , " the younger guard suggested . His companion agreed , sending the youngster running toward the fire . While the senior sergeant watched him go , Annya let her hand slide down inside the strap , grasping the ax handle . Silently backing her horse , she got the big Brabant between the guard and the gate . Then she rose in the saddle , swinging her ax in a huge arc , bringing it crashing down on gate latch . Bolt and latch shattered under the blow . By the time the surprised guard turned to see what happened , a tidal wave of forest folk was pouring out of the slave pen . Spurring her mount , she rode right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he could get up . " To the ferry , " Princess Annya told her people , then shouted the same message in Markovite . " Get to the dock ! Seize the ferry ! " Leading by example , she galloped downstream to the dock , with the freed slaves at her charger 's heels , taking the startled ferry crew by surprise . Some of the forest folk went straight into the skiffs and vanished downriver . The rest jammed aboard the ferry along with the terrified Markovites . Princess Annya kept her armored horse and body between them and the fire , covering them as best she could . Estonians instantly raised the alarm , but the knights were dismounted , disarmed , and deep in their cups , mouths full of roast pork , and flat on their asses - poorly positioned for any counter-attack . Before the crusaders could recover , the ferry was loaded and pulling away from the dock . Princess Annya went in last , still atop her charger , Estonian arrows clanging off her armor . Women heaved on the ferry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferry crew frantically worked the poles . Arrows fell among them , producing screams and curses . People poled harder , desperate to get out of arrow range . Children hid under her horse , and cute little Peter clung to her armored hip . Princess Annya drew her sword for the first time , slashing at the taut ferry rope . An arrow buried itself in her saddle . Sawing furiously , she severed the rope . Freed of the south bank , the ferry swung out into the broad strong current . Still tethered to the north bank , the ferry was carried away by the swift flowing river , finally striking the far bank well downriver and out of arrow range . Scrambling ashore , the Markovite crew managed to lash the barge to the bank . Forest folk disembarked in leaps and bounds , disappearing into the trees . Doing a rattling dismount , Princess Annya led her Brabant charger ashore , assisted by young Peter , who laughed uproariously , saying , " Hideously splendid . I knew you were too smart to be a Pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could tell by your eyes ! " Safe on the north bank of the Daugava , the boy held tight to her horse 's reins , smiling happily up at her . Had she told him she was a princess , Peter could not have been more impressed . MATING FLIGHT Annya hoped it would take at least a day for the Knights of the Sword to restore the ferry , since most of their boats and row barges were upriver , raiding along the south bank toward Karaslava . She asked Peter the distance to the besieging camps , and the boy replied , " Two days or so , your majesty , depending on if you are ahorsed , or afoot . Even longer if you are lame , or carrying a load . " " Can you show me ? " she asked , aiming to make the best time possible . Peter nodded eagerly , already acting as her squire . " Then do so , " she told him . " I mean to be there before nightfall tomorrow . " " Nightfall on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Peter led her down the forest road running along the north bank , headed back toward Zilvinas - but this time coming up behind the besiegers . Princess Annya asked , " How far have the Knights of the Sword been raiding on the south bank ? " " Halfway to Karaslava , " Peter told her . " They have a huge slave pen near Suba on the south fork . " " Why do your people allow it ? " Annya wondered aloud , not really expecting an answer . Peter looked up at her , like his new master really was some fool of a Pole , who knew nothing about forest life . " My people can not stop them . " Markovites hereabout were mostly freeholders , allowed to own spears , bows , and mail coats , but that did not make them any match for the Knights of the Sword . " Only the princes can do that . " And they were off besieging Zilvinas , oblivious to the pillaging on the south bank . Somehow she must drive a wedge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since the Time of Troubles , western Markovy had been a collection of petty princedoms and city states , owing loose allegiance to King Demi tri in distant Markov - while he was alive . Now that Demitri was dead , west Markovy must fend for herself against German crusaders , slave traders , and land-hungry Swedes . Western civilization at its worst . When Peter tired of walking , Annya had him ride pillion behind her , and they pressed on into the night , nodding in the saddle , letting the horse find the way back to his oat bag and stall in Prince Nikolas 's camp . When it got too dark and cold for the horse , they took shelter in a serf hovel , where the frightened family found themselves hosting not only armed strangers , but the big warhorse as well , nearly filling the log hut . Letting their hosts lie down with the pigs , Princess Annya took the place of honor by the hearth . Peter eagerly helped Annya strip off her armor , marveling at the strength and workmanship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came off Peter exclaimed , " Your majesty is a woman ? " " Afraid so . " Princess Annya smiled at his surprise , spreading out her bedroll . Still wearing her arming doublet , she made a place for Peter beside her , saying , " Come , at least you will not have to worry about being buggered in the night . " He crawled happily under the blankets , nestling in next to her . Markovite boys were tyrannical with girls their age , excluding them from their games , cuffing and abusing them when they could ; but they instinctively sought the comfort of women , seeing nothing shameful in the female body , that miraculous source of warmth , nourishment , and pleasure . Peter asked , " If you are neither a man , nor a Pole , who are you ? " " Someone who wishes you well . " Pulling her cloak over both of them , she asked , " Where is your family ? " " My father is dead , I think . " Peter sounded very matter-of-fact about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with few rights and scant hope for a future . " My mother and sisters were taken south , to the slave pens near Suba . " " I will do what I can for them , " Princess Annya promised , kissing him goodnight . " Go to sleep . We have much to do on the morrow . " " But why do you wear weapons and armor ? " Peter asked . " Because I am a Valkyrie , a chooser of the slain . Now go to sleep . " Confident she would not choose him , Peter cuddled closer . For a while Princess Annya lay listening to his slow breathing , suddenly feeling very maternal toward this young Markovite ; then she slept . At first light , Peter was still curled next to her , with one hand inside her arming doublet , cupping the breast closest to him . Since her little son died , Annya rarely ever got to be maternal with men . Girls and young women looked up to her , seeking her advice and blessing . Males she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on extreme occasions killed , but she hardly ever mothered them . Life among the Markovites presented opportunities as well as dangers . Disengaging herself from the sleeping boy , she rose to pray and see to her charger , telling her hosts to stoke up the hearth and put on water for her bath . As the hovel grew hot and steamy , she stripped off her arming doublet and washed herself , letting the assembled Markovites see a forest princess in the flesh . When she was done , Peter and the family used her soiled , lukewarm water on themselves . She paid the serfs with silver , which they had never seen before , owing their lord with labor services , and paying their taxes in squirrel skins . She left Peter with them as well , knowing the boy could never shut up about seeing his knight naked . Giving her charger his head , she ambled toward the camps , feeling her way . As they got closer , the horse himself picked up the pace , happily entering the home stretch . Men appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing they would get nothing off a heavily armed Pole . When pickets asked her business , she earnestly tapped her breastplate and replied , " Polsha , " then pointed ahead . They waved her through , seeing small danger in a single rider who barely spoke Markovite . At the camps , she let the horse lead her almost home , drawing rein when they reached the red-and-white banner marking the bivouac of Prince Nikolas 's Polish mercenaries . Captain Jakosz 's jaw dropped , seeing his former employer and paramour amble up aboard a stolen charger belonging to his current master . " Jesus Christ , " Jakosz swore , " what is m'lady doing here ? And on that horse ? " She grinned down at him . " Visiting old friends . " Jakosz rolled his eyes , and snapped an order to his squire . " Help this man down , then get his horse out of sight . " He hustled her into his quarters , a windowless log dug-out with a makeshift hearth and smoke hole . Here she doffed her helmet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have gotten her strenuously groped , were she not in full armor . When they were done , Captain Jakosz whispered , " We are at half-pay , living on bad water and horse flesh , so I hope you have not come to enlist . " She laughed and shook her blonde head . " This armor was just to get me past your pickets . " " Thank goodness . " Jakosz sighed . " We have enough trouble already from your forest folk sniping at our fires . The Minsk militia refused to eat dogs and rats , and deserted en masse - but I suppose that sounds good to you . " " Oh , no ! " Annya shook her head again . " I hate suffering , even among men and dumb beasts . " Then she added slyly , " Are you not happy to see me ? " " Always delighted , m'lady . " Jakosz kissed her again , even more passionately . " But having you here in camp is incredibly awkward . " He was not " having her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because your oath to Prince Nikolas demands you give me up to him at once ? " Jakosz nodded . " And I do not want to give you up at all . " Princess Annya grinned at the compliment . " Luckily , I very much want to meet Prince Nikolas . " " You do ? " fakosz looked instantly askance at the notion of his employers getting together . " For a peace parley . " She strove to make her intentions sound as innocent as possible . " I think he and I could come to an understanding . " " I imagine you could . " Jakosz smirked at the thought , adding , " Prince Nikolas is a married man . " " As are you , " Annya reminded him . " Will you help arrange a parley ? Then you might really see your wife again , instead of sitting here at halfpay , dodging arrows and fouling your drinking water . " " Put it that way , and a parley does not sound so bad . " Captain Jakosz took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money . " But I can not just slip you into his tent . " And if he did , she might never get out . " Does Prince Nikolas go hunting ? " Jakosz laughed . " Only if he wants fresh meat to eat . Every day or two , I would say . " : Prince Nikolas of Pzkov went hunting the morning after next , taking his boar spears , his huntsmen and dog pack , a score of beaters , and two dozen Kazak horse archers - just in case . Tall and dark-bearded , he had keen piercing eyes and a hard warrior 's body , dressed in a fur-trimmed hunting jacket , cloth-of-gold leggings , and tooled leather boots . He rode a hardy gray hunter , with a black mane and tail , leading his cavalcade deep into the forest , since the stump stands around the camps had been hunted down to the moles and wood mice . Princess Annya watched the hunt progress through her spyglass , seeing birds fleeing as the beaters attacked the boar thickets , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She waited until noon when the men were spread out and the horses tired , then she headed downhill through the trees and brash , working her way between the hunters and the beaters , keeping well clear of the Kazaks . Forest folk guided her to a clearing where Prince Nikolas had dismounted over the first kill , an unfortunate roebuck that had wandered into the boar hunt . Looking up , Prince Nikolas saw a Polish man-at-arms mounted on his handsome brick red stallion . He called out to her , " Halt , there . Where did you get that horse ? " Instead of stopping , she cantered into the clearing , letting Prince Nikolas get a good look at her mount . Then she turned to go , and huntsmen bent their bows , ready to shoot . As she galloped off , Annya heard the prince yelling , " Hold your fire . He 's in armor , you fools ! You 'll just hit my horse . " In an instant Prince Nikolas was aboard his gray hunter , crashing through the brush behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nimbly dodging tree trunks , the prince 's horse nearly caught the big Brabant , but even in plate armor , Annya weighed less than Nikolas , and her fresher mount had plenty of speed in hand . Whenever they came to a clear space where Prince Nikolas could hope to draw even , Annya would spur her mount and put distance between them , only letting his hunter catch up when they were crashing along a game trail , branches snapping in their faces , making her glad to be wearing steel . As the chase mounted , the hunt faded behind them . Horns grew fainter and the hounds could no longer be heard . Avoiding the net thrown out by the Kazaks , Annya led her pursuer away from the river , farther into the trackless forest . They splashed through a narrow ford between wood and water , a favorite spot for forest ambushes , where no Kazak or huntsman would voluntarily pass . In the next clearing she reined in , confident they would not be disturbed . Prince Nikolas came bursting out of the thicket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing a boar spear at her mount . " Is that my horse ? " She laughed at his out-of-breath earnestness . " Not anymore . " Aghast at her impudence , Prince Nikolas was not the least afraid to confront a felon in full armor , confident he could handle the situation with just a boar spear . " Who do you think you are ? " Up close , Prince Nikolas of Pzkov looked even more promising than at a distance . Here was a man she could work with , one who had the power to do what she wanted . He could ride , swim , and satisfy a woman , for he had one wife already and was not bad looking . And he was the most powerful Markovite prince west of Nordling , so all the local boyars would follow his lead . Deciding to drop pretenses and parley in earnest , she took off her helmet and hung it on her saddle bow , pushing back her mail cowl and saying , " Princess Annya , Lady of Zilvinas , at your service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had you besieged ? " " You did . " She gave him her most winning smile . " But now I have you . " " You do ? " He nudged his horse closer , grinning confidently , though she was in plate armor and he in leather and cloth-of-gold . " I think not . You forget that this is my horse . " As he said it he leaned forward and reached for the reins , drawing the charger to him . Her horse went willingly , obeying his master 's hand . Which was good . Princess Annya liked his sureness , and the way he kept coming , chasing her down , pulling her close , and declaring her his . Very flattering . Face to face , Prince Nikolas was stalwart and exciting , with none of Captain Jakosz 's hesitant Catholic guilt . Markovites thought women were sinful , promiscuous creatures with the morals of a mink in heat . Princes and boyars kept their wives , daughters , sisters , and mothers locked away from temptation , and were free to pad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his catch , Nikolas patted her mount affectionately , adding , " He goes where I say . " " Where is that ? " she asked archly . " To my camp , where you will order Zilvinas to open her gates . Our camps are pestilent , and our armies impatient , so the sooner you open up , the better things will be for everyone . " " Everyone but me , " Annya observed . Smiling at her defiant attitude , Prince Nikolas took her steel-clad arm , saying , " Come , it will not be so bad . I will see no harm comes to you . " " Really ? " She wished that were true . " Of course , " he replied , as if her safety were easily arranged . " Does your " protection " include being dragged back to your polluted camp , so I may see my fortress sacked and my people enslaved ? " Prince Nikolas grimaced . " Alas , there m'lady has no choice . " " Not so . " She shook her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . You do . " Lady Death had taught her that . Nikolas laughed at her insistence . " I may choose . You must do as I say . " " Say something pleasing , " she suggested , " then I might do it . " " Is this pleasing ? " He kissed her , and Princess Annya kissed back , determined to put everything into this parlay . When their tongues untwined , she told him , " It beats being dragged back to your diseased camp . " He shook his head at her hopeless resistance , kissing her again . As he did , archers in skins and leather stepped into the clearing , quietly taking charge of the horses , careful not to disturb their princess , who was parlaying in earnest with the Markovite . When the kiss ended , Prince Nikolas swore in astonished amazement , " What in hell ! Who are these forest gnomes ? " Annya smiled , so he would not feel so bad . " These are my people . Pray forgive their shabby appearance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satin . " Peeling his fingers from her steel sleeve , she told the astounded Prince Nikolas , " Now , my lord , you are coming with me . " " I most certainly am not . " Nikolas of Pzkov barely believed that his latest conquest had turned on him , aided by wild men in skins . He had an army camped nearby , and two score men a quick ride away , and when he began the kiss , Zilvinas was his as well .... " You are my prisoner , " she explained , " so come along , unless you prefer to be dragged . " Or worse . Grinning archers loosened their lariats , ready to tie the Markovite to the tail of his own horse . Prince Nikolas decided he preferred to ride , suffering an insolent footman to take the reins and lead him into the woods . Archers followed with smirks on their faces . Prince Nikolas warned , " Your people will pay for any insult to my person , and they can ill afford more troubles . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would hate to see you sacrificed . " " Sacrificed ? " He looked at her in surprised alarm . " What do you mean ? " " I am a Valkyrie . A chooser of the slain , just like Lady Death . All princesses of Zilvinas are . " Leaning over in the saddle to comfort him , Annya patted his mailed thigh . " Do not worry . I will be as kind to you as you would be to me . Kinder even , but you must behave . " " Behave ? " He looked askance at her . " How ? " " Like a man . " Annya left it at that - if Prince Nikolas needed to be told how to be a man , then he would indeed be better off head down in a lake . Winding their way farther into the forest , they crossed a line of hills by a hidden pass , then forded a long shallow lake on a secret bridge made from sunken stones . After negotiating another narrow pass , they entered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince Nikolas quit his complaining , sensing it would do him no good , and might get him killed . Marveling at the forest fastness instead , he asked , " Why do you need Zilvinas ? You would never be found here . " " Zilvinas is our gateway to the world . This is home . " She led him to the head of the valley where a huge pine thrust up through the canopy . Scarred by fire and lightning , and thicker than a house , the tree rose like a living wooden tower into the lush greenery overhead . Annya dismounted from her stolen warhorse and happily stripped off her armor , which had served its purpose ; first the leg armor , then the sleeves , gorget , and back-and-breast , leaving her in just her boots and the padded arming doublet , which had legs down to her knees . Not her favorite outfit , but Prince Nikolas clearly found it fetching . Light as a feather without her armor , Annya doffed her boots to stand barefoot on the dark forest floor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first ancestors had done . She said a silent prayer to the tree , which had sheltered her family for generations ; then she guided Prince Nikolas to a concealed doorway in the huge pine . Hidden behind the bark door were steps cut into the wood where an ancient fire had gotten past the bark armor , burning a deep cleft in the tree . Leaving the horses and men behind , she and Nikolas mounted the narrow curving stairs , which led up to a hole cut in the trunk above a broad branch in the lower canopy . Resting on the branch was a large woven basket , with a wicker door on one side . Ropes ran up from the basket , disappearing into the foliage . Princess Annya opened the wicker door , inviting Nikolas to join her . " Come , this will be fun . " " I very much hope so . " He got in with her , using the moment alone to be familiar , feeling for her figure through the padded doublet . " You know , I am missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled a crimson signal cord and the basket rose up the dark rough side of the giant pine , drawn by a winch farther up . " He did not come this way . " His fingers loosened the laces on the back of her doublet . " Which way did my ensign go ? " " That is a woman 's secret , " she declared primly , feeling his hand go down the back of her padded knee pants . " Like this ? " he asked , a rough fingertip tracing the downward crease in her buttocks . " Even more secret . " Men had been where Prince Nikolas was headed , and lived to tell - the same could not be said of the sacred lake . By now Prince Nikolas was more concerned with how far he could get than in the fate of his missing bannerman . His hand crept farther , raising shivers as it went . Suddenly they broke through the canopy into the sunlight , getting a dizzying view of the green-gold treetop sea , filling the narrow valley and spilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast shining landscape , Prince Nikolas stopped to stare . Annya reached behind her and grabbed his hand , shoving it farther into her pants . " Keep going , " she told him . " This is my favorite spot to make love . Where rocs and eagles mate . " Prince Nikolas eagerly obeyed , as they rose higher into the light , stopping at a balcony that ran all the way around the tree . Ladders led up and down to sturdy limbs topped by light catwalks . Women waiting at the rail to receive their princess applauded her amorous advent , opening the wicker gate and extracting her from the arms of Prince Nikolas , who hastened after her onto the balcony . Laughing women led them to a little thatched bedroom shaped like a birdhouse , hanging from a limb above , with a roc 's perch sticking out beneath the blue-painted door . Here the women propelled Prince Nikolas inside , while Annya stayed out on the railed balcony to change . " What do you think ? " she asked her women , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will he do ? " " Handsome for a Markovite , my lady . " " With those dark eyes and cruelly curved lips . " " No need to drown this one . " She nodded . " Not yet anyway . " Giggling at that , they stripped off her arming doublet , washed her limbs with warm rose water , then helped her into her flying outfit ; a padded embroidered jacket over blue silk pajamas , tucked into soft glove-leather boots . Then she went to the hanging birdhouse bedroom , to put her prince to the final test . Little birdhouses hung from the big one , and doves cooed in the eaves . Inside the room was filled by a feather bed , on which Prince Nikolas was sitting . He brightened as soon as he saw her appear in the painted doorway . " Now you look more like the Lady of Zilvinas . " Smiling at the compliment , she turned slowly to show off her flying suit . " Did you ever doubt me ? " " Doubt you ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely know what to make of you . " She arched an eyebrow . " Because I live in a birdhouse ? " " No . " Prince Nikolas laughed at that notion , taking hold of her blue-silk pajama pants and slowly pulling her closer . " This birdhouse bed is the sanest thing I have seen so far . " " You should see the tree at night , " she said , letting him pull her onto the bed , " when lamps and tapers burn on the balconies and birdhouses , becoming a shining string of lights climbing through the pine branches . " " Just like a giant Christmas tree ? " He slid his hands inside her padded coat , pushing up her pajama top . " A giant what ? " Annya had never heard of any tree like this one . " Another thing Catholics pray to . " Prince Nikolas grinned at his beautiful captor 's naivete . " You could not have found me a nicer prison . " Straddling his legs with hers , she sank down into her prisoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you as you would be to me . " " Kinder even . " Prince Nikolas 's smile widened . " This feathered nest certainly beats my stinking , pestilent camp . " " So why go back ? " Princess Annya honestly could not understand why men would choose to huddle in some dismal hole , dying in droves just to make war on each other . " Ally with me ; and live free . Can Baron Karaslava , or the Knights of the Sword offer you any better ? " To emphasize her point , she pressed her blue silk pajama bottoms into his cloth-of-gold crotch . " You make it awfully tempting , " he admitted , slipping his hands beneath her pajama top , stroking her breasts . " Yet you exaggerate what I can do . I am an elected prince , and could be recalled by the citizens of Pzkov if I go too far . Aside from the civic militia , I have only my Kazaks , and some Polish mercenaries of doubtful loyalty . " She knew just how doubtful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employers making up in bed . " And the citizens of Pzkov would disapprove of allying with me ? " " My , yes . " And his wife as well , but he would not let go of her breasts , running his thumbs over her stiff nipples . " You are a pagan forest witch , just about everything the Godfearing citizens are against . " " Worse than the Knights of the Sword ? " she asked , with a sultry pout . " Who are taking your people as slaves . " " We have only your word for that , " he reminded her , not anxious to cross the Knights of the Sword . " Though if it were true , it would sorely anger Pzkov . Any serfs being sold are some landlord 's property , and no one likes innocent defenseless children being raised as Catholics . " " Then let me show you , " she suggested , pushing his hands off her breasts and leaping out of his lap ; there would be no more feeling her up until they settled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can at least look for yourself ? Do you need permission for that ? " Prince Nikolas stared hard at her , wondering what in heaven he had gotten himself into , when all he meant was to go boar hunting . " I do not need permission . But we are well north of the river , and if the Knights are rampaging along the south bank , how will we even get across to see ? " " Do not worry , I will get you there today , " Annya promised , giving him a lingering thank-you kiss . When their lips parted , she whispered , " To me you are a real prince . " She took him up the basket elevator to the rookery , where rocs " nests made of mud and dead branches rested in the crooks of massive limbs . Here sat another basket , attached to lines above , and resting on a launch Tamp overlooking the trackless sea of treetops . Peter was waiting , having been brought here the day before by her personal huntsmen . Ecstatic to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms about her legs and happily burying his head in her blue silk crotch . Princess Annya managed to pry Peter off her , turned the boy about , and introduced him to her prince . " This is Prince Nikolas of Pzkov , and he has come to see the slave pens at Suba . " Peter thanked the prince profusely , saying , " My mother and sister are there . Will you be rescuing them soon ? " Prince Nikolas looked in alarm at the huge double-triplane box kite that the basket hung from , asking , " Must this be now ? " " Unless you are willing to take this boy 's word ? " Annya suggested . He was the one who wanted proof . " There is a steady north wind blowing , and we do not know how long that will last . " Prince Nikolas grimaced , but agreed to go . She would have been disappointed if he had given in without seeing for himself . She did not want to win just because Prince Nikolas was afraid of flying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small basket , and the ground crew released the anchor , slowly unreeling the long launch cable . Carried aloft by the giant box kite , the basket rose above the green canopy , accompanied by a trio of tame rocs wearing empty pack saddles . Lines ran from the rocs " saddle harnesses to the box kite 's support lines . When they reached the end of the launch cable , the towering pine looked like a twig , far below . She asked Prince Nikolas , " Are you ready to take a peek at Suba ? " Nikolas looked evenly back at her , saying , " I am even more curious to know what became of my missing ensign . Why not go looking for him ? " Observing a holy silence , Annya released the long launch cable , which swiftly fell away below them . At the same time the rocs took off , dragging them downwind , providing direction and lift , converting the huge double-triplane kite into a towed glider . Peter loved it , oohing and ahhing with a child 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Between bursts of excitement , he would shout questions . " What is that down there ? " " An eagle . " Or a young griffhawk , hard to say at a distance . " Why does it look so tiny ? " " Because we are very far up . " " I 'll say ! " Peter declared happily . Flashes of bright water showed amid the green canopy as they neared the Daugava , then the broad Mother River herself appeared . Princess Annya pointed out a galley bearing the Teutonic cross of the Knights of the Sword . " see , she is anchored by the south fork tributary that leads to Suba . " " Which proves nothing . " Prince Nikolas peered down at the long slim warship . " Except that the Knights are hereabouts . " " And busy . " She showed Prince Nikolas how to use the spyglass , pointing out thin columns of smoke upriver . " Those fires are far inside Markovite territory . " Prince Nikolas was more interested in the spyglass , which he swore had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people bathing by the river . " He was going to get an even better look , since the kite was nearing the end of its long glide . Treetops drew closer , and she directed the spyglass toward two cleared circles in the canopy , on either side of the Suba tributary . " There are the slave pens . " " They look nearly empty . " Prince Nikolas had been having better luck with bathers . " Watch when we go over . " There is nothing like a roc-drawn kite passing overhead to bring out folks with little to do . As they passed low over the nearer clearing , people poured out of log huts , looking up in anxious amazement . Staring down at the packed faces it was easy to pick out the stolid , drably dressed Markovites , amid the tattooed and skin-covered forest folk . " Look ! " Peter shouted , " There , that 's my sister . " He waved vigorously to his startled sibling , a blonde about five or so in a russet dress , yelling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister 's surprised face broke into a huge grin , as the little girl recognized her brother , waving wildly back at him . Peter shouted down , " Go get mother , you silly cow ! " His sister dashed off to obey , and moments later the boy was shrieking , " Mom ! Look , it is me ! " Princess Annya could not tell which woman was his mother , but it did not matter , since this was obviously the spot . She released the rocs and the kite drifted downward , headed toward the treetops beyond the cleared area . Seeing a good-sized oak below them , Annya dropped a grapple line , snagging the upper limbs . Instantly the basket jerked to a stop . Prince Nikolas looked aghast , asking , " What are you doing ? " " This is what we came to see . " They were tethered to the top of the giant oak , on a line held taut by the big box kite catching the north wind above . She showed him a crank in the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us down . " He turned the crank , working a winch that wound them down the grapple line , until the swaying basket came to rest on an upper limb , in plain view of the slave stockades . Peter scrambled out of the basket onto an oak limb , claiming he had never been so high in a tree before . Holding tight with one hand , he waved eagerly to the slaves in the nearest stockade . Knights of the Sword in full armor rode up to the pens , drawn by the slaves " excitement , and Princess Annya pointed the spyglass at them , asking , " Now do you believe the Knights have Markovites in those slave pens ? Or must we take a closer look ? " " I am convinced , " Prince Nikolas announced , already closer than he liked . " So will you do the right thing ? " Annya asked . " What is that ? " Peering down through the foliage , Prince Nikolas saw lance points below . Mounted Knights of the Sword had surrounded the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and ally with Zilvinas . " Annya had vowed to put her whole self into these negotiations , and it would be good for everyone if her next child had the Prince of Pzkov for a father . Her people dearly needed friendly relations with the Markovites , and what could be friendlier than making babies ? " And rescue my family ! " Peter pleaded , from his perch on a nearby limb . " I can not rescue anyone , " Prince Nikolas protested . Not even himself . Estonian spearmen had joined their German masters at the base of the tree . Mounted knights might not be much at climbing trees , but the Estonians were born in the woods . " Yes you can . " To prove it , Annya pulled out her bird whistle , and blew a long shrill blast . As the Estonians started up the tree , the three rocs that brought them settled down atop the oak , pack saddles still harnessed to their backs , ready to take on passengers . Annya asked , " Will you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Estonians , scrambling up the oak to get him . " Do I have a choice ? " You always have a choice , " Annya insisted , sliding her hands inside his hunting jacket , feeling taut muscled flesh through his silk undershirt . Captain Jakosz was every bit as strong , and just as married , but unlike the Pole , Prince Nikolas had the power to rescue her and her people . And Peter 's people too . Together , forest folk and Markovites could push the Knights back to Riga if they stopped fighting each other . " Marry me , and help save these slaves . Then your militia gets to go home heroes , while you get me for an ally . " " And the Knights of the Sword for my enemies , " Nikolas added ruefully . " They were your enemies already . " She kissed her prospective groom . " You just did not know it . " True enough . He had not even wanted to know it , but there was no stopping things now . He must " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monks in armor . Luckily , pagan marriage was not binding beyond the forest , totally unsanctioned by the Church . Or any church , for that matter . As she helped him buckle into the roc 's pack saddle , Prince Nikolas warned her , " This will not be a proper marriage . " Meaning he would not keep her locked away in his harem , with his wife , daughters , concubines , and inconvenient female relations ; having her when he wished , and whipping her when she warranted it . Princess Annya pouted coyly , pulling the hand-forged buckle tight . " You make that sound like a bad thing . "
