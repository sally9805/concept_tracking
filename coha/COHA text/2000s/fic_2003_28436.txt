" Ironic , is n't it ? " said Gib with a somewhat crooked grin , shifting his back against the ice wall and putting on his jacket . It had been hot work climbing the last pitch , but at this altitude you soon lost heat . " The boot 's usually on the other foot ! " Josh grimaced . " I 'm sorry to hear that , " he said slowly . " I always liked Mallory . You seemed really good together too . " " That 's what I thought , " said Gib wryly . " Mallory 's a very special lady . Smart as anything and beautiful and independent ... I really thought she was going to be different . " He tapped the side of his crampons with his ice pick to loosen the balled ice . " But then the old C word started cropping up and I knew that was the beginning of the end . " " The what word ? " asked Josh , diverted . " Commitment . " Gib stared morosely out at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frozen ledge , high up on the mountain . It was still some way to the summit , but you could look out at the hills stretching off to the hazy horizon . Gib loved the mountains . The air was clean and pure and the only sound was the wind cutting icily through the brilliant sunlight . He was glad that Josh had called him up and suggested a climb . It was good to beup here where everything was simple and there was not a tearful woman in sight . It certainly made a nice change . " Why are women so obsessed with commitment ? " he demanded . " They all start off pretending that they 're independent and just want a good time , but you 're lucky if you get to a third date without them planning their wedding dresses ! " " You and Mallory had been together a bit longer than three dates , " Josh pointed out reasonably . " It 's nearly a year now , is n't it ? " " Exactly ! " grumbled Gib . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did she have to go and spoil it ? " " What did she say ? " " Apparently I am completely unable to ' commit ' or to ' relate . ' " Gib hooked his fingers in the air to add sarcastic emphasis to the inverted commas . " According to Mallory , I just thought of her as part of some kind of smorgasbord of women ! " Josh looked blank . " A smorgasbord ? " " You know , one of those buffet affairs where all the dishes are set out along a big table and you go round to help yourself to whatever you fancy . " " Right , " said Josh , none the wiser . " Mallory 's theory is that I treat women like so many different dishes , so that even if I find one I really like , I wo n't be content to stick with one because I 'll always be wondering if there might not be one I might like even better further along the table . " Gib gave an exclamation of disgust . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Josh did n't answer directly . Behind the dark glasses that protected his eyes from the glare , his expression was unreadable as he studied the view and considered Mallory 's theory . " She 's right , though , is n't she ? " he said at last . " Listen , whose side are you on ? " demanded Gib . " You 're the one who said that she 's a smart lady . " " I just happen to like women , " said Gib defensively . " What 's wrong with that ? " " Nothing . " " And women like me . " He scowled . " I love women ! It 's ridiculous to say that I ca n't relate to them properly ! " " Is that what Mallory says ? " " She says I 've got no idea how to be friends with a woman . " Gib sounded outraged . " Can you believe that ? " " Yes . " " What do you mean ? " he asked , taken aback by the typically quiet , uncompromising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... sometimes ! Josh was checking the ropes . " Have you ever had a platonic relationship with a woman ? A good one ? " " Sure . " " When ? " " When ? Well , let 's see ... when ... when ... " Gib searched his mind frantically . " OK , I ca n't think of anyone right this moment , " he was forced to acknowledge , " but I 'm sure there must have been someone . I bet you ca n't think of anyone either , " he added , going on the offensive . It did n't faze Josh . " Yes I can , " he said calmly . " Bella is one of my best friends , probably the best friend I 've got , in fact . We were students together , and we 've been close ever since . " " And you 've never slept with her ? " " No . " " I bet you wanted to ! " Josh shook his head . " No , that would spoil our friendship . Bella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have girlfriends , but it 's different with her . I prefer what we 've got . I can talk to Bella in a way I ca n't talk to anyone else . We understand each other . " It 's nothing to do with sex , " he went on . " You could never be friends with a woman in the same way . " " Want a bet ? " said Gib , ruffled . " OK . " " OK ? " Josh tied off the end of the rope and sat back against the rock . " I 'll bet you ... let 's say ten thousand dollars ? ... to the charity of your choice that you ca n't be friends with a woman . " Gib laughed . " Ten thousand dollars ? You 're kidding , right ? " " You can afford it . " " Yeah , but can you ? " " I do n't think I will have to , " said Josh with annoying calm . Well , Gib was n't a man who could turn down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends is a bit subjective , is n't it ? How would we decide if I 'd succeeded or not ? " Josh unwrapped an energy bar and chewed meditatively for a while . " How would you feel about spending a few weeks in London ? " he asked at last . " It would n't be a problem , I guess , " said Gib , a bit thrown by the apparent non sequitur . " It 's easy enough to keep in touch with what 's happening here wherever I am . " Absently he took the bar Josh handed him out of his ruck-sack . " As a matter of fact , " he went on slowly , " it might suit me quite well . I 've been thinking about developing more European connections and with this whole Mallory thing , I would n't mind leaving the country for a while . I could do without all those scenes about who takes what ! " " OK . " Josh nodded briskly . " Here 's the deal . Bella shares a house in south London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting married soon , so they 're going to have a spare room . I reckon I could arrange it for you to live with them for a while . " He grinned . " I think it would be a real test for you ! If at the end of six weeks Bella and Kate and Phoebe all describe you to me as a real friend , you name the charity and I 'll send the cheque ! " " Hhmmnn . " Gib looked a bit dubious . " What are these girls like ? " " They 're just three very nice , very ordinary English girls . " " And that 's it ? I just live with them for six weeks and be their friend ? " " There 's one more condition , " said Josh . " You have to go incognito . You 've had too many attractive , successful women falling over themselves for you here . Mallory 's a psychologist and before that there was the TV presenter and that model ... what was her name ? The one with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's the one . " Josh allowed himself to remember her legs for a moment . They really had been spectacular . " Anyway , the point is , you 're spoilt ! " he went on . " It 'll be different in London . The girls wo n't know anything about you , so you wo n't be able to buy their affection or impress them the way you do here . You 'll just have to be yourself and if you ca n't be friends with them under those circumstances then you 'll just have to accept that Mallory is right ! " ( Continues ... )
