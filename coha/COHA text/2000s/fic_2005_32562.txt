Emily telephoned , his older daughter . " Can you come get us ? " she said . " It 's an emergency . " As usual , she did n't greet him , she did n't say hello at the start of the call . And also as usual , this bothered him , he felt a familiar pull of irritation at her voice , her tone . But even as he was listening to her , he was focused on steering the truck around the sharp curves in the narrow road , around several small heaps of rock that had slid down the steep hillside : he was feeling the pleasure he always took in the way the slanted afternoon light played on the yellowed grass and reddened leaves left in the vineyards , in the way the air smelled . He kept his voice neutral as he responded . " When ? Now ? " In the background , behind her , Mark could hear someone give a sudden whoop . Festivities , he thought . As ever . Eva 's face rose in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gathering at her house : to celebrate a birthday -- reasonable enough ; but also for a project completed , a team victory , a skill accomplished . You learned to ride a bike , you got a party thrown for you . " Duh . Yes , Dad , now , " Emily said . " That 's what I mean . " He was headed north on 128 to a small vineyard he thought his crew should harvest tomorrow . He needed to check the grapes . But he could probably get Angel to do it if he had to . His windows were open . The noise of the rushing air made his daughter 's voice on the car phone sound distant . " So ? " she said . " Can you ? " If his younger daughter , Daisy , had ever called him because of an emergency , it would have been a child 's crisis -- not making the basketball team , needing a ride somewhere that her mother or stepfather couldn'tprovide . But with Emily , this emergency was likely to be at least slightly serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even be sympathetic with . But she would be taking charge again , and this was something he and his ex-wife had agreed that she should be discouraged -- no , freed -- from doing so often . He cleared his throat . " Maybe I should talk to your mom , " he said . Yes . The approach to take . " Dad ! " she objected . He did n't answer for a long moment , and as if in response to this , her voice had changed when she spoke again . She sounded younger : " Mom ca n't talk right now . That 's why we need you . " And with those words , we need you , it was settled . To be needed . Well . Mark thought of Emily 's delicate oval face , her regular , pretty features , her curly dark hair , so like Eva's -- all the things that were lovely about her . All the things that did n't piss him off . " Okay , " he said . " Okay , as it happens , I can come . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be charmed . " Now ? " she said impatiently . " Now . Or , gim me ten or so . " He was slowing , and as he pulled into a turnaround by the roadside , the truck bounced and his tires crunched on the dusty gravel . " Okay . " She sighed , in relief it seemed . " Just honk , though , " she said . " We 'll come out . Oh , and Dad ? " " Yeah ? " " It 's for overnight . " It could not be for overnight . He had plans . He had a date . He was going to get laid . " Okay , sunshine , " he said . " We 'll work it all out . " She sighed again and hung up . Twenty minutes or so later , when he pulled up at the curb in front of his ex-wife 's large Victorian house , the door opened before he hit the horn and his younger daughter staggered out onto the wide porch , carrying her sleeping bag , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barefoot . Her long brown legs were exposed nearly to the crotch in cutoff jeans -- legs that were beginning to look less like sticks and more like a woman 's , he noted . Emily came out the door after her , turned backward as if to fuss with something behind her . Two pretty , dark , young women , one tall , one short : his daughters . He got out of the truck to go and help them . As he started up the walk , he saw Theo emerging from the house behind Emily . The little boy , not yet three , was carrying a brown paper grocery bag by its handles . Something stuck out of it -- a pillow ? a blanket ? He spotted Mark and smiled . Now Emily took Theo 's hand to help him down the wide porch stairs . He paused on each one , and the bag plopped slowly from step to step behind him as he descended . Mark met them on the walk . " Hey , " he said . He kissed each girl on her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shampoo . He took Daisy 's sleeping bag from her . " Theo ! " he said , and extended his hand down to him . " To what do we owe this pleasure ? " " I 'll explain it all to you , " Emily called back . She had moved ahead of them down the walk , between the orderly gray-green procession of rosemary plants . She was tossing her stuff into the open back of the truck . " So he 's supposed to spend the night too ? " Mark asked Daisy . Theo was not his son . Theo was his ex-wife 's son , by her second marriage . He liked Theo . He was , in fact , charmed by him -- he knew him well from various extended-family events -- but he had never before been asked to babysit for him . And actually , no one had even asked . Daisy shrugged . She looked , as she often did , sullen . Or evasive . Her face was narrower than Emily 's , her nose still slightly too big on it -- she was fourteen -- her eyebrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last two years , and now she was only a few inches shorter than Mark . She carried it badly , trying to hide it . Mark had worried when she was younger that she would be plain , which seemed to him an almost unbearably sad thing -- a plain woman . Within the last six months or so , though , her face had changed and strengthened , and he saw that that would n't be the case . That she might , in fact , be better-looking than Emily in the end , more striking . It had made him easier around her , he realized . They had caught up to Emily , who said again , " I 'll explain it later . " She sounded irritated , as though she were the adult and he a nagging child . She took Theo 's hand and led him to the door of the truck 's cab . Mark went around to the driver 's side . He opened his door and stood there looking across the cab 's wide seat , waiting for Emily to look back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First she was helping the little boy clamber into the truck ; now she climbed up herself and was busy buckling him in . When she finally raised her eyes and met her father 's , he was ready . He lifted his hands . " Hey , Em , " he said . " You will admit --  " " Daddy , it 's an emergency . A real emergency . " Her eyes , he noted now , were red-rimmed , their lids swollen . Theo looked over at him and nodded . " It 's a mergency , " he said , and inserted his thumb into his mouth with an air of finality . Daisy squeezed in next to Emily , and Mark got in and started the truck . He pulled into the street . After nearly a full minute had passed , he asked , " So , the nature of this emergency is . . . ? " He could feel Emily 's gaze on him , and he looked at her . She was frowning -- her dark eyebrows made fierce lines . She shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should n't . . . talk about it now . " She gestured at Theo , sitting between them , watching them soberly . Mark nodded . After another long moment he said , " But at some point it will be revealed . " " Yeah , " she said . She turned away , and when he looked over again , he saw that she and Daisy were holding hands . What the hell was going on ? Daisy 's mouth hung open stupidly , as though she 'd been sucker punched . They drove in near-total silence the whole way to his house . Everyone 's eyes stayed devoutly on the road , as though the familiar scenes rolling past -- the valley as it widened out and spread the fall colors of its vineyards before them , the deep green of the hills riding along above it all -- were some new and fascinating nature movie . Once Daisy said in a near-whisper , " Are those pills supposed to knock her out or something ? " and Emily shrugged . That was it . Knock who out ? Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-wife -- small , dark , quick moving , graceful . Her sudden sexy smile . Not Eva . Above Calistoga , he turned in at the unmarked dirt road to his house . There were sparse , newly planted vineyards on either side of it . He had to swerve and dance the truck to avoid the ruts . He could feel Theo 's weight swing against his side . After about a quarter of a mile , he pulled into his driveway and then up onto the cement pad where one day he planned to build a garage . As soon as he cut the engine , they could hear the dogs barking in the house . The children started to unbuckle their seat belts , and he swung himself out of the truck . He began to gather their possessions from the back . They came and stood behind him -- silent , oddly passive , waiting for their things to be put into their hands . He led the way . When he opened the back door , the dogs shot out and started jumping around , abruptly quieted by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Theo made a little noise of terror and delight and stepped between Mark 's legs , gripping his thighs . Mark put his hands on the boy 's narrow shoulders , and was instantly startled -- and then aware of being startled . Why ? Why did it feel so strange to touch the little boy ? Perhaps because he had anticipated the way the girls felt when they were Theo 's size , when he had loved to touch them , to hold them . Theo 's body was wiry and tense , utterly unlike theirs at the same age . It felt hot with energy . " It 's okay , big guy , " Mark said gently . " They like you . They like kids like you . " Theo looked up at Mark , wide-eyed and alarmed . " They would like to eat me ? " he asked . He was lighter-haired , lighter-skinned than the girls , and this difference somehow struck Mark as sad . " No , no , no , " Mark said . " They like to lick you , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice . " He squatted by Theo and held his own hand out to Fanny to be licked . When Theo imitated him after a moment , Fanny 's long , rough tongue came out and stroked the boy 's hand too . He snatched his arm back and jigged a little in fear and pleasure , a prancey running in place . He wore miniature red high-top sneakers . His striped socks had slid down almost entirely into them . One of his knees was thickly scabbed . Emily and Daisy had disappeared immediately into the house , to put their things away , Mark assumed . He stood up . Theo grabbed his hand , and walked right next to Mark , into the kitchen , through it , virtually riding his left leg and talking all the while to the dogs : " No bite me ! Bad dog ! Bad , bad dog ! No bite ! " Mark was feeling a rising , irritated frustration , which he did n't want to focus on the little boy . He gestured across the living room , toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out what everyone 's up to , shall we ? " Theo looked up at Mark . " Yah , " he answered . Theo shadowed him to the doorway of the back room . The girls ' beds nearly filled its narrow space . It was dark and underwatery in here -- the one window faced out into an overgrown evergreen shrub , which Mark kept meaning to prune , and had n't . The light that filtered through it was weak and greenish . Daisy was carefully spreading her unzipped bag out on her bed , as she always did . This was her strategy to avoid making it , a chore she hated . Emily was already lying down , one arm under her head , staring out the window at nothing . Ignoring him , Mark felt . " A word with you , Em ? " he said , his voice carefully neutral . Both girls looked at him . They seemed startled , like sleepers he 'd wakened . He turned to his younger daughter . " Daze , could you keep an eye on Theo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She nodded . " I not scared , " Theo was instantly shrilling . " I a big boy . I not scared . " As Mark and Emily stepped toward the doorway , Daisy , who had flopped down onto her bed , was starting a game : " How big are you , Theo ? Big as a . . . lion ? " " Yes ! " the boy cried . As soon as Mark shut the door to his room , Emily sat down heavily at the foot of his rumpled bed and said , " Oh , Daddy , it 's John . John 's dead . " Her face twisted , and tears immediately began sliding down it , as though she 'd been waiting until this moment to allow herself her full measure of grief . " What do you mean ? " John was Eva 's husband , the girls ' stepfather . Theo 's father . " He 's dead , Daddy . " Her hands came to her face now and covered her opened mouth . She inhaled sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He got hit . . . by a car . A car hit him . " Mark pictured it . He pictured it wrong , as it turned out , but he saw John then -- his large body , bloody , slumped behind the wheel of his ruined car . He saw him dead , though he did n't believe it . Mark sat down next to his daughter and held her , and she wept quietly and thoroughly , as he could n't remember her weeping since he had told her he was moving out -- long shuddering inhalations , and then a gentle high keening as her inheld breath came out . From the other bedroom he could hear Theo shrieking , " Bad ! Bad ! " and Daisy 's voice trying to distract him . " Sweetheart , it 's okay . Cry , cry , " he said . And then he said , " Shhh . " Though he was still thinking of John , still trying to take it in , he was also aware of thinking that it felt good , holding Emily . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Daisy . He could n't remember . When she had calmed down a little , he stretched away from her to grab the box of tissues from the stand by the bed . She blew loudly , using several , and wiped her face . His shirt was wet where she had leaned against him . " How did it happen ? " he asked at last , keeping his voice gentle . " When ? " She seemed stricken again at the question , her eyes swam and grew larger , but she held on and whispered back , " This afternoon . A car just . . . hit him . " Mark cleared his throat . " He was driving ? "
