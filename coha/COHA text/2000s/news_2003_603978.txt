Compiled by Chris Jenkins and Larry Marshak . <p> 0 jack Sprague <p> Age : 38 <p> Hometown : Spring Lake , Mich . <p> Notable : Three-time Craftsman Truck Series champion ( 1997 , ' 99 , 2001 ) . Holds three truck records : $ 4.7 million in winnings , 98 top-fives and 132 top-10s . The only driver to run the first 170 races in trucks .

Last victory : June 2002 at Nashville . <p> 2003 forecast : Will make races but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with newcomer Cup team , although engines and technical help from Hendrick wo n't hurt . <p> 1 Steve Park <p> Age : 35 . <p> Hometown : East Northport , N.Y . <p> Notable : Missed first four races of 2002 season recovering from severe head injury he suffered in a Busch race in 2001 . Finished 39th in his first race back at Darlington , the track where he was injured . <p> Team : Dale Earnhardt Inc . <p> Crew chief : Tony Gibson . <p> Sponsor/car : Pennzoil/Chevrolet . <p> Safety harness : HANS . <p> Winston Cup career : 146 starts , two wins , 11 top-fives , 32 top-10s , $ 9.79 million in winnings . <p> 2002 season : Finished 33rd in points , two top-10s , $ 2.68 million in winnings . <p> 2003 forecast : A few good runs and a top-20 points finish  --  not enough to hold on to his job . After a shaky return from serious injury in 2002 , DEI executives have put tremendous pressure on Park to perform this season by giving him only a one-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive aggressively enough to put the No. 1 car in victory lane at least once but carefully enough to avoid the wall ; no driver crashed and spun out more than Park last season . <p> 2 Rusty Wallace <p> Age : 46 . <p> Hometown : St. Louis . <p> Notable : The 1989 Winston Cup champion failed to win a race for first time in 16 years in 2002 . Team switched from Ford to Dodge in the offseason . <p> Team : Penske Racing South . <p> Crew chief : Bill Wilburn . <p> Sponsor/car : Miller Lite/Dodge . <p> Safety harness : Hutchens . <p> Winston Cup career : 598 starts , 54 wins , 189 top-fives , 309 top-10s , 36 poles , $ 34.44 million in winnings . Last victory : April 2001 at Fontana , Calif . <p> 2002 season : Seventh in points , seven top-fives , 17 top-10s , $ 4.78 million in winnings . <p> 2003 forecast : Two wins and a top-15 points finish . Wallace did n't win a race last season , the first time that has happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year  --  he has n't finished better than seventh in the points in four seasons  --  but it would be a surprise if he did n't return to victory lane . Switch to Dodge could be more of a short-term setback to the team than the Gibbs team 's switch to Chevys because Penske made the final decision to change cars late last season . Unlike Gibbs , the Penske team must develop new engines . <p> 4 Mike Skinner <p> Age : 45 . <p> Hometown : Susanville , Calif . <p> Notable : Second year with team and first year driving a Pontiac . Moved up nine spots in points but had only one top-10 finish . <p> Team : Morgan-McClure Motorsports . <p> Crew chief : Chris Carrier . <p> Sponsor/car : Kodak/Pontiac . <p> Safety harness : HANS . <p> Winston Cup career : 203 starts , 10 top fives , 39 top 10s , $ 11.24 million in winnings . Best finish : second in April 2000 at Talladega . <p> 2002 season : Finished 31st in points , one top 10 ( sixth ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Some OK runs but not enough of them to crack the top 25 in points . Team owner Larry McClure 's cars have visited victory lane 14 times since 1983 , but the one-car team is struggling to stay relevant . <p> 5 Terry Labonte <p> Age : 46 . <p> Hometown : Corpus Christi , Texas . <p> Notable : Two-time Winston Cup champion ( ' 84 , ' 96 ) has not won a race in three years . He and Bobby are the only brothers to win the championship . Last victory : March 1999 at Fort Worth . <p> Team : Hendrick Motorsports . <p> Crew chief : Jim Long . <p> Sponsor/car : Kellogg's/Chevrolet . <p> Safety harness : HANS . <p> Winston Cup career : 745 starts , 21 wins , 177 top-fives , 344-top 10s , 26 poles , $ 29.78 million in winnings . <p> 2002 season : Finished 24th in points , best finish of third , $ 3.2 million in winnings . <p> 2003 forecast : Four-year slide will continue , as Labonte will finish outside the top 25 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even realize Labonte used to be really good because he has n't finished in the top 10 in points in four seasons and has n't won a race since 1999 . At this point , is he just keeping the seat warm for Kyle Busch or another driver ? <p> 6 Mark Martin <p> Age : 44 . <p> Hometown : Batesville , Ark . <p> Notable : Bounced back from a winless 2001 with one victory ( Coca-Cola 600 ) and a second-place finish in the closest points race since 1996 . <p> Team : Roush Racing . <p> Crew chief : Ben Leslie . <p> Sponsor/car : Viagra/Ford . <p> Safety harness : HANS . <p> Winston Cup career : 530 starts , 33 wins , 200 top-fives , 315 top-10s , 41 poles , $ 36.17 million in winnings . Last victory : May 2002 at Concord , N.C. <p> 2002 season : Finished second in points , one win , 12 top-fives , 22 top-10s , $ 7 million in winnings . <p> 2003 forecast : Top-10 finish , possible championship contender . Martin came close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short ; he has been in that situation before and bounced back . Assuming the " young guns " do n't push veterans completely out of the picture this year , there 's no reason to think he wo n't contend again . Martin says he wo n't feel sorry for himself if he never wins the title , so you should n't either . Remember , he has won more than $ 36 million in prize money . <p> 7 Jimmy Spencer <p> Age : Turns 46 Saturday . <p> Hometown : Berwick , Pa . <p> Notable : Lost ride with Chip Ganassi Racing after a disappointing 2002 season . Got off to horrible start in failing to qualify for 2002 Daytona 500 . <p> Team : Ultra Motorsports . <p> Crew chief : Tommy Baldwin . <p> Sponsor/Car : Sirius Satellite Radio/Dodge . <p> Safety harness : Hutchens . <p> Winston Cup career : 404 starts , two wins , 27 top-fives , 76 top-10s , three poles , $ 14.88 million winnings . Last victory : October 1994 at Talladega . <p> 2002 season : Finished 27th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 2.1 million in earnings . <p> 2003 forecast : Will make races , but wo n't finish in the top 25 in points . Upset after an on-track incident , Kurt Busch called Spencer a " decrepit old has-been " last August . Spencer 's results from last season  --  six top-10s , seven DNFs  --  supported Busch . Out to prove he should n't be put out to pasture , but Ultra equipment might not be the right horse . <p> 8 Dale Earnhardt Jr . <p> Age : 28 . <p> Hometown : Kannapolis , N.C. <p> Notable : Swept pair of restrictor-plate races at Talladega , but after a hard crash at California Speedway in April fell out of title chase with consecutive finishes of 36th ( California ) , 36th ( Richmond ) and 35th ( Lowe 's Motor Speedway ) . <p> Team : DEI . <p> Crew chief : Tony Eury Jr . <p> Sponsor/car : Budweiser/Chevrolet . <p> Safety harness : Hutchens . <p> Winston Cup career : 111 starts , seven wins , 23 top-fives , 37 top-10s , six poles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2002 at Talladega . <p> 2002 season : Finished 11th in points , two wins , two poles , 11 top-fives , 16 top-10s , $ 4.97 million in winnings . <p> 2003 forecast : Championship contender . Here 's a bold preseason prediction from the semi-reluctant emperor of NASCAR Nation : " We are definitely a top-five or top-three team coming out of the box this season . " Signs point to improvement for Junior , but garage wisdom , such as it is , says he and the team still are not going to be consistent enough to win the title . Biggest reason for optimism is an offseason personnel shake-up to his crew that should improve pit stops ( about time , we humbly add ) . <p> 9 Bill Elliott <p> Age : 47 . <p> Hometown : Dawsonville , Ga . <p> Notable : Won back-to-back races ( Pocono and Indianapolis ) in 2002 , but late-season slump knocked him out of the top 10 in points . Holds the Daytona qualifying record ( 210.364 mph in 1994 ) . Snowboards in Vail , Colo. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Team director : Mike Ford . <p> Sponsor/car : Dodge Dealers/Dodge . <p> Safety harness : HANS . <p> Winston Cup career : 697 starts , 43 wins , 166 top-fives , 307 top-10s , 55 poles , $ 31.42 million in winnings . Last victory : August 2002 at Indianapolis . <p> 2002 season : Finished 13th in points , two wins , four poles , six top-fives , 13 top-10s , $ 4.1 million in winnings . <p> 2003 forecast : One win and a top-15 finish . Elliott is still surprisingly competitive as he closes in on the big five-oh , but maybe we should have expected more from a 47-year-old who snowboards . Wo n't be awesome enough to contend for the title , but another win or two and a top-10 finish in the points would be another pleasant surprise . <p> 10 Johnny Benson <p> Age : 39 . <p> Hometown : Grand Rapids , Mich . <p> Notable : Popular driver picked up his first Winston Cup victory in the fall race at Rockingham . Missed five starts because of rib injuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Crew chief : James Ince . <p> Sponsor/car : Valvoline/Pontiac . <p> Safety harness : HANS . <p> Winston Cup career : 228 starts , one win , 16 top-fives , 54 top-10s , two poles , $ 12.66 million in winnings . Last victory : November 2002 at Rockingham . <p> 2002 season : Finished 29th in points , one win , three top-fives , seven top-10s , $ 2.79 million in winnings . <p> 2003 forecast : A top-15 finish and maybe another victory . <p> 11 Brett Bodine <p> Age : 44 . <p> Hometown : Chemung , N.Y . <p> Notable : Only true owner/driver remaining in Winston Cup ; Kyle Petty still has The King . Has n't won a race since 1990 . Last top-five finish was in 1992 . Had no top-10 finishes last season . <p> Team : Brett Bodine Racing . <p> Crew chief : John Wolfe . <p> Sponsor/car : Hooters/Ford . <p> Safety harness : HANS . <p> Winston Cup career : 474 starts , one win , 16 top-fives , 61 top-10s , five poles , $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at North Wilkesboro , N.C. <p> 2002 season : Finished 36th in points , best finish of 13th at Talladega , $ 1.8 million in winnings . <p> 2003 forecast : Underfunded single-car team will struggle to make races . <p> 12 Ryan Newman <p> Age : 25 . <p> Hometown : South Bend , Ind . <p> Notable : Outdueled Jimmie Johnson to win rookie of the year in 2002 . Won only one race , but had 22 top-10 finishes and was on the pole six times . Also won the all-star race , the Winston . Considered a leading candidate for Winston Cup championship despite switching form Ford to Dodge . <p> Team : Penske Racing South . <p> Crew chief : Matt Borland . <p> Sponsor/car : Alltel/Dodge . <p> Safety harness : Hutchens . <p> Winston Cup career : 44 starts , one win , 16 top-fives , 24 top-10s , seven poles , $ 5.8 million in winnings . Last victory : September 2002 at New Hampshire Speedway . <p> 2002 season : Won one race , six poles , 14 top-fives , 22 top-10s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Championship contender . Despite a switch from Ford to Dodge that could prove to be a short-term setback for the Penske team , there is a heavy amount of preseason championship buzz for Newman . Why ? He 's a smart , focused guy surrounded by other smart , focused guys  --  and in terms of raw talent , he just might rank up there with Gordon and Stewart . He had a shaky start to his rookie season and tailed off slightly at the end , but almost no driver was hotter in between . Refinement is the key word . <p> 14 Larry Foyt <p> Age : 25 . <p> Hometown : Houston . <p> Notable : Moving up from the Busch Series to drive his father 's Winston Cup entry . Bringing sponsor Harrah 's along for the ride . Foyt is switching from Pontiac to Dodge . Stacy Compton started the 2002 season but was replaced by Mike Wallace at the Brickyard 400 . <p> Team : A.J. Foyt Racing . <p> Crew chief : Butch Lamoreux . <p> Sponsor/car : Harrah's/Dodge . <p> Safety harness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zero Winston Cup starts . Will be racing for 2003 rookie of the year . <p> 2002 season : Finished 20th in points in the Busch Series , two top-10s , $ 581,335 in winnings . Best finish of eighth ( April at Talladega ) . <p> 2003 forecast : Team will make races but wo n't do much else . The younger Foyt has n't shown that he is ready for Cup , and garage sages say A.J. does n't spend enough money to be competitive in NASCAR . <p> 15 Michael Waltrip <p> Age : 39 . <p> Hometown : Owenboro , Ky . <p> Notable : Picked up his second Winston Cup career win at Daytona in July , one of three restrictor-plate victories in four races for DEI . <p> Team : DEI . <p> Crew chief : Slugger Labbe . <p> Sponsor/car : NAPA Auto Parts/Chevrolet . <p> Safety harness : HANS . <p> Winston Cup career : 534 starts , two wins , 25 top-fives , 95 top-10s , $ 18.05 million in earnings . Last victory : July 2002 at Daytona . <p> 2002 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four top-fives , 10 top-10s , $ 3.2 million in winnings . <p> 2003 forecast : His place at DEI seems to be secure after a season of instability , and another year with Labbe should help . Expect a victory at a restrictor-plate track , a pleasant midseason hot streak and a top-15 finish in the points . <p> 16 Greg Biffle <p> Age : 33 . <p> Hometown : Vancouver , Wash . <p> Notable : Busch Series rookie of the year in 2001 and Craftsman Truck Series rookie of the year in 1998 . Won truck series title in 2000 . Going for rookie triple he as enters Winston Cup series . <p> Team : Roush Racing . <p> Crew chief : Randy Goss . <p> Sponsor/car : Grainger/Ford . <p> Safety harness : HANS . <p> Winston Cup career : Seven starts , $ 394,773 in winnings . Best finish : 13th at California Speedway in April 2002 . <p> 2002 season : Won the Busch Series championship , winning four races , $ 1.3 million in winnings . <p> 2003 forecast : A victory and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he 's getting his Johnson/Newman-type shot with Roush Racing . Jamie McMurray already has a victory , but Biffle 's refined talent might make him the favorite for rookie of the year . <p> 17 Matt Kenseth <p> Age : 30 . <p> Hometown : Cambridge , Wis . <p> Notable : Three DNFs hurt in points race last year , but series-high five wins and one pole eased the pain . <p> Team : Roush Racing . <p> Crew chief : Robbie Reiser . <p> Sponsor/car : DeWalt Power Tools/Ford . <p> Safety harness : HANS . <p> Winston Cup career : 112 starts , six wins , 20 top-fives , 41 top-10s , one pole , $ 9.67 million in winnings . Last victory : November 2002 at Phoenix . <p> 2002 season : Finished eighth in points , five wins , 11 top-fives , 19 top10s , one pole , $ 4.5 million in winnings . <p> 2003 forecast : Multiple wins and a top-10 finish . Kenseth just signed a contract extension , bringing stability to a team that lost a few members of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the best in the business ? With consistency , could contend . <p> 18 Bobby Labonte <p> Age : 38 . <p> Hometown : Corpus Christi , Texas . <p> Notable : Fell out of top 10 for the first time since 1996 . Won 2000 Winston Cup championship . <p> Team : Joe Gibbs Racing . <p> Crew chief : Michael McSwain . <p> Sponsor/car : Interstate Batteries/Chevrolet . <p> Safety harness : HANS . <p> Winston Cup career : 330 starts , 19 wins , 89 top-fives , 149 top-10s , 21 poles , $ 30.13 million in winnings . Last victory : April 2002 at Martinsville , Va . <p> 2002 season : Finished 16th in points , one victory , five top-fives , seven top-10s , $ 4.2 million in winnings . <p> 2003 forecast : Late-season surge puts them in the top 10 in points . Labonte got back into victory lane last season , but did n't exactly improve on what was considered a disappointing sixth-place finish in 2001 . Stewart 's success shows that the Gibbs equipment is n't at fault ; perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team around . <p> 19 Jeremy Mayfield <p> Age : 33 . <p> Hometown : Owensboro , Ky . <p> Notable : Fighting a three-year victory drought . Showed some spark with a pair of top finishes in first year driving for Ray Evernham . <p> Team : Ray Evernham Motorsports . <p> Team director : Kenny Francis . <p> Sponsor/car : Dodge Dealers/Dodge . <p> Safety harness : HANS . <p> Winston Cup career : 273 starts , three wins , 35 top-fives , 62 top-10s , six poles , $ 14.22 million in earnings . Last victory : June 2000 at Pocono . <p> 2002 season : Finished 26th in points , $ 2.5 million in winnings . Best finish : second in Las Vegas . <p> 2003 forecast : Incremental improvement , a few strong runs and a top-20 points finish . Mayfield has ability but had a disappointing 2002 as Evernham experimented with different team personnel combinations . Put the right people around him , and Mayfield could surprise . <p> 20 Tony Stewart <p> Age : 31 . <p> Hometown : Rushville , Ind . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first championship . Has finished in the top 10 in all four seasons and has multiple wins in three seasons . <p> Team : Joe Gibbs Racing . <p> Crew chief : Greg Zipadelli . <p> Sponsor/car : Home Depot/Chevrolet . <p> Safety harness : Hutchens . <p> Winston Cup career : 140 starts , 15 wins , 54 top-fives , 87 top-10s , eight poles , $ 20.93 million in winnings . Last victory : August 2002 at Watkins Glen , N.Y . <p> 2002 season : Finished first in points , three wins , 15 top-fives , 21 top-10s , $ 9.16 million in winnings . <p> 2003 forecast : Championship contender . Winning back-to-back championships is n't easy , and it is n't going to happen for Stewart if the team has another six DNFs this season . Also a likely Daytona 500 contender . The hope : Stewart matures  --  but not to the point where he gets boring . <p> 21 Ricky Rudd <p> Age : 46 . <p> Hometown : Chesapeake , Va . <p> Notable : Hoping for a less hectic season now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2002 's early " silly season , " and it affected his driving with Robert Yates Racing . <p> Team : Wood Brothers Racing . <p> Crew chief : Pat Tryson . <p> Sponsor/car : Motorcraft/Ford . <p> Safety harness : HANS . <p> Winston Cup career : 767 starts , 23 wins , 187 top-fives , 356 top-10s , 27 poles , $ 28.97 million in winnings . Last victory : June 2002 at Sonoma , Calif . <p> 2002 season : Finished 10th in points , one win , eight top-fives , 12 top-10s , $ 4.4 million in winnings . <p> 2003 forecast : A victory and top-15 finish . Lost in the drama between him , team owner Robert Yates and his crew last season was the fact that Rudd was n't out of the title hunt at midseason last year . Certainly will be happier at Wood Brothers , but will extra financial support from Ford and technical help from Roush make this one-car team a surprise title contender ? <p> 22 Ward Burton <p> Age : 41 . <p> Hometown : South Boston , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start in 2002 , winning the Daytona 500 , but a season average finish of 24th left him out of the top 10 for second consecutive season . <p> Team : Bill Davis Racing . <p> Crew chief : Frank Stoddard . <p> Sponsor/Car : Caterpillar/Dodge . <p> Safety harness : Hutchens . <p> Winston Cup career : 286 starts , five wins , 24 top-fives , 75 top-10s , seven poles , $ 17.97 million in winnings . Last victory : July 2002 at New Hampshire . <p> 2002 season : Finished 25th in points , two wins , three top-fives , eight top-10s , $ 4.9 million in winnings . <p> 2003 forecast : A victory and a top-20 finish . Underrated Davis team gives him winning equipment , but neither driver nor team has shown enough consistency to break into the top 10 since finishing ninth in 1999 . <p> 23 Kenny Wallace <p> Age : 39 . <p> Hometown : St. Louis . <p> Notable : Replaced Hut Stricklin at the Southern 500 and has a two-year deal to drive the No. 23 Dodge . Began the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full Busch Series campaign , finishing seventh in points . <p> Team : Bill Davis Racing . <p> Crew chief : Philippe Lopez . <p> Sponsor/car : Stacker2/Dodge . <p> Safety harness : HANS . <p> Winston Cup career : 264 starts , six top-fives , 28 top-10s , best finish of second ( three times ) , $ 9.3 million in winnings . <p> 2002 season : Finished 39th in points , one top-10 finish , $ 1.4 million in winnings . Best finish : 10th at Rockingham in February . <p> 2003 forecast : Cup series ' class clown will put together a few strong runs and a top-25 points finish . <p> 24 Jeff Gordon <p> Age : 31 . <p> Hometown : Vallejo , Calif . <p> Notable : Slipping from first to fourth in the championship race was big news for the four-time champion . But a streak of 31 races without a victory and news of his divorce were even bigger news in 2002 . <p> Team : Hendrick Motorsports . <p> Crew chief : Robbie Loomis . <p> Sponsor/car : Dupont/Chevrolet . <p> Safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts , 61 wins , 160 top-fives , 210 top-10s , 41 poles , $ 51.9 million in winnings . Last victory : September 2002 at Kansas City . <p> 2002 season : Finished fourth in points , three wins , 13 top-fives , 20 top-10s , three poles , $ 6.15 million in winnings . <p> 2003 forecast : Multiple wins , championship contender . Gordon admits that personal issues were something of a distraction last season ; the divorce is n't final , so it might be a while before he is able to put it completely behind him . All said , though , Gordon did n't fare too badly on the track last season . And in the conversion process from " Wonderboy " to " The Bachelor , " he seems to have loosened up . <p> 25 Joe Nemechek <p> Age : 39 . <p> Hometown : Lakeland , Fla . <p> Notable : Drove himself into a job with the No. 25 team . Finished second in season finale at Homestead . Started season with owner Travis Carter , but sponsor Kmart pulled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Crew chief : Peter Sospenzo . <p> Sponsor/car : UAW Delphi/Chevrolet . <p> Safety harness : HANS . <p> Winston Cup career : 285 starts , two wins , 11 top-fives , 35 top-10s , six poles , $ 12.3 million in winnings . Last victory : November 2001 at Rockingham . <p> 2002 season : Finished 34th in points , three top-fives , $ 2.4 million in winnings . <p> 2003 forecast : A pole position or two , a few strong runs and a top-25 finish . <p> 29 Kevin Harvick <p> Age : 27 . <p> Hometown : Bakersfield , Calif . <p> Notable : With the exception of a short hot streak that included a victory , Harvick probably would like to forget most of the 2002 season . Already on probation in ' 02 for an on-track Busch race incident in March , Harvick was " parked " for a Winston Cup race in April after on-track incident in a truck race . <p> Team : Richard Childress Racing . <p> Crew chief : Gil Martin . <p> Sponsor/car : GM Goodwrench/Chevrolet . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 starts , three wins , 11 top fives , 24 top 10s , $ 8.15 million in winnings . Last victory : July 2002 at Joliet , Ill . <p> 2002 season : Finished 21st in points , one win , one pole , five top fives , $ 3.8 million in winnings . <p> 2003 forecast : Harvick dropped off the radar screen with his disappointing year , but do n't forget about him . If 2002 was the year of the Roush resurgence , ' 03 could see the Childress comeback . If so , Harvick could easily win multiple races and a top-10 points finish . Had to drive conservatively for most of last season to avoid NASCAR officials ' scrutiny but is free to cut loose ( within reason ) . <p> 30 Jeff Green <p> Age : 40 . <p> Hometown : Owensboro , Ky . <p> Notable : Had a consistent 2002 Cup season . Sitting on pole for this year 's 500 . <p> Team : Richard Childress Racing . <p> Crew chief : Mike Beam . <p> Sponsor/car : America Online/Chevrolet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 94 starts , five top-fives , nine top-10s , one pole , $ 4.13 million in winnings . <p> 2002 season : Finished 17th in points , best finish of second at New Hampshire in September , $ 2.53 million in winnings . <p> 2003 forecast : Green and the No. 30 quietly were the best team in the RCR stable last season . Expect at least a few strong runs and a top-25 finish . Can win races with the right people and equipment . <p> 31 Robby Gordon <p> Age : 34 . <p> Hometown : Cerritos , Calif . <p> Notable : Only driver to run in the Indy 500/Coca Cola 600 double last season , finishing eighth at Indianapolis , then flying to Lowe 's Motor Speedway where he finished 16th . <p> Team : Richard Childress . <p> Crew chief : Gil Martin . <p> Sponsor/car : Cingular Wireless/Chevrolet . <p> Safety harness : HANS . <p> Winston Cup career : 98 races , one win , five top-fives , 11 top-10s , $ 6 million in winnings . Last victory : November 2001 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points , five top-10s , $ 3.3 million in winnings . Best finish : Third at Watkins Glen in August . <p> 2003 forecast : Childress likes his drivers a little edgy , which helps explain his fondness for Gordon .
