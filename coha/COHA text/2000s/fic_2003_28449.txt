Chapter One " Almost there , almost there , " Vicky Sutton chanted the words like a prayer . A prayer in which hope , fear and excitement were hopelessly entangled . Steering her small rental car around yet another of the narrow road 's hairpin curves , she finally saw a straight stretch ahead and pressed down on the accelerator . The car leaped forward , seemingly as eager as she was to get to her destination . She 'd come so far . And not just in distance , although the miles between suburban Philadelphia and rural England were considerable . But those miles dwindled to nothing when compared to the mental journey she 'd made in the past two weeks . Starting from a point of shocked disbelief at the incredible news the fertility clinic 's lawyer had so reluctantly given her , Vicky had worked her way through furious anger that anyone , particularly a trusted doctor , could have done such a despicable thing , to euphoric joy at the unintended results of his act . She 'd finally ended up deeply mired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to negotiate the ground rules for a situation that appeared to have no legal precedent . And now , after two interminable weeks , she was about to realize her heart 's desire . She was finally going to meet them . Her slender fingers tightened nervously on the steering wheel as she remembered she was also going to meet someone else . Someone who not only did n't want to meet her , but who had expressly forbidden her to come . Someone who had only grudgingly agreed to meet with her lawyer , Ms. Lascoe , after Vicky had threatened him with a lawsuit . Vicky shivered at the thought of how he was going to react when he found out that , at the last minute , Vicky had decided to come herself instead of sending Ms. Lascoe as they 'd agreed . It did n't matter , she told herself . James Edward Andrew William Thayer was n't going to get his own way this time - something she suspected had n't happened to him very often in his privileged life . Vicky 's breath caught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twelve-foot-high sandstone pillars that marked the entrance to her destination , Thayer House . Slowing almost to a stop , she carefully turned the car onto the neatly graveled driveway . In the distance she could see a sprawling , three-story mansion sitting atop a slight rise . It radiated a sense of age and power that she unexpectedly found intimidating . By the time Vicky actually reached Thayer House , her heart was thumping so hard she felt light-headed . All she could think about were her children . Behind that elegant facade were the children she 'd yearned for all her life . Children she 'd given up all hope of ever having . Until two weeks ago , when her prayers for motherhood had been so improbably answered . Abandoning the car in the driveway , Vicky hurried toward the house . She stumbled slightly on the first of the three broad , shallow steps in her haste to reach the gleaming black door . Grabbing the shiny brass knocker , Vicky gave it a sharp rap and , when the door was n't immediately answered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door swung open on well-oiled hinges to reveal a slightly overweight , middle-aged man in a black suit . " Good afternoon , madam , " he said . " May I help you ? " " Ye - " Vicky 's voice , stretched thin by her nerves , snapped on the word . Taking a deep breath , she tried again . " Yes , I 'm here to see Mr. Thayer . I 'm Ms. Lascoe . " " Certainly , he is expecting you , Ms. Lascoe . Welcome to Thayer House . " The man opened the door wider , and Vicky stepped inside , surreptitiously searching the vast entrance hall for her children , even though she knew it was highly unlikely that six-month-old twins would be passing their time there . " I am Beech , the butler , " the man said . He sounded like a character straight out of a P. G. Wodehouse novel , Vicky thought , swallowing the nervous giggle that bubbled up in her throat . " You may wait for Mr. Thayer in the green drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you arrived . " Paged ? Vicky examined the word . Somehow the modern reference seemed out of place in this old house . Although she could definitely see the advantages of a pager in a place this big . " This way , Ms. Lascoe . " Beech started toward the back of the hall . Vicky followed him on trembling legs , desperately trying to conceal her escalating nervousness . All that stood between her and her children now was James Thayer . Her lips firmed in grim determination . He did n't stand a chance . She 'd deal with the devil himself for her children 's sake . What was one overprivileged Englishman ? Beech pushed open the door to a large room filled with an eclectic collection of museum-quality Chippendale furniture and comfortably faded chintz . He gestured her inside . " If you 'll have a seat , Mr. Thayer will be with you shortly . " " Thank you . " Vicky 's voice came out on a squeak of suppressed emotion . Fortunately , Beech did n't seem to notice . He merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door quietly behind him . Too nervous to sit still , Vicky walked over to the French doors that opened onto a flagstoned terrace and peered out at the lush green perfection of the meticulously tended lawn stretching in all directions . To her right was an elaborate rose garden , and in the distance she could see a long glass greenhouse with an onionlike dome perched on one end . As Vicky watched , a man emerged from the greenhouse and started across the grass toward the house . She tensed as she took in the proud tilt of his head and the casual elegance of his clothes . He had to be the owner of all this magnificence . Intensely curious about this unknown man who had fathered her children , Vicky moved closer to the French doors in order to get a better look at him . And he was definitely worth a second look , she conceded . He moved with the coordinated grace of a seasoned athlete , and he looked ... Vicky frowned as an unexpected and totally unwelcome prickle of awareness danced over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trap the brilliant June sunlight , giving it a reddish gleam . She could n't quite make out the color of his eyes because of the distance , but they appeared dark . Dark and impenetrable . As if they were full of secrets he would n't easily give up . Vicky 's gaze slipped lower , studying the unyielding line of his tightly compressed lips . He looked annoyed about something . Probably her arrival , she admitted . He certainly had n't wanted her here . He had n't wanted her anywhere near the twins . But she did n't care what he wanted . She was n't going to be talked into disappearing from her children 's life . Not now . Not ever . The twins were the only children she would probably ever have , and she was determined to be part of their life . An important part . Vicky took a deep breath , trying to control her nervousness . She was not relishing the coming interview . Not only did she hate personal confrontations , but James Thayer 's bearing exuded a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd come herself instead of sending Ms. Lascoe , and he was not going to take the news well .
