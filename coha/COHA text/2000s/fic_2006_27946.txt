London , England , 1812 . . . " Do you feel sorry for me ? " " Dreadfully sorry , darling . " At the sound of voices , Ellen Drake halted in shuffling her deck of cards . She 'd been anxious for a quiet interlude and a chance to rest after a trying day , but apparently , no privacy was to be had . She was huddled in the shadows of the earl 's library , hiding and playing solitaire at a writing desk that was situated behind a large potted plant . She peeked around it . From her discreet location she could n't see who 'd entered , but it was a man and a woman . Considering that they 'd sneaked away from the crowded party -- as had she -- and that they were cooing and purring , it was obvious that a romantic tryst was commencing . When the man spun the key in the lock , Ellen 's suspicions were confirmed . He was bent on seduction , and his partner eager for it to happen . Of all the rotten luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which she could escape , but there was n't one . She was trapped , and the sole means of exit was her bumbling into the middle of the torrid scene , which she was loathe to attempt . Though she 'd been in London but a few hours , she was aware of how the members of the Quality were prone to amorous mischief , and she could n't bear to witness which wife was consorting with which husband . She had a firm moral constitution , had had a decent and respectable upbringing , and when she knew a person had a penchant for adultery it was difficult to be civil . Her host , Alex Marshall , Lord Stanton , was the prime illustration of how arduous it was to pretend nonchalance . A decade earlier , when she was a girl ofeighteen , Stanton had been in the country , merrymaking at a local estate . She 'd stumbled upon him in the woods , doing all sorts of things he ought n't with a neighbor 's daughter . Ellen had never forgotten a single detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any courtesy toward him ? For months , since the moment she 'd learned that she 'd be traveling to London and staying in Stanton 's home , she 'd been panicked . In light of her post as a lady 's companion , she could n't have refused to accompany her employers , Rebecca and Lydia Burton . Nor could Ellen voice her opinion as to why she was opposed to Rebecca 's betrothal to Stanton . As the disaster unfolded , she could only observe and stew . As she was a spinster who 'd been forced to make her own way in the world , Ellen 's reputation had to be beyond reproach . She could never mention Stanton 's base character , for then she 'd be compelled to recount how she 'd spied on him . Fortunately , during the brief period they 'd been in his house , Stanton had n't deigned to appear , so she 'd avoided meeting him , and she hoped to delay an introduction for as long as she was able . Rebecca was Stanton 's cousin , their marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her twenty-two years waiting for Stanton to decide he was ready to tie the knot , which he finally had , so at his behest they 'd scurried to the city to set the process in motion . She was thrilled and excited , but Ellen was convinced that Rebecca would be miserable with such a rampant libertine for her husband . " The nuptial noose is tightening , " the man was commenting . " I 'm about to have my wings clipped . " " Poor dear , " the woman soothed . " Matrimony can be so tedious . " " Ca n't it , though ? " An engaged man ! Ellen fumed . Who was about to be wed ! The cad ! There was a lengthy pause , a rustle of clothing , some giggling ; then the woman said , " You 're a beast to lure me away from the festivities . " " Why did you let me ? " " You 're so . . . tense . " " Oh , I 'm definitely tense , " the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relax . And soon ! " " I thought I should offer my assistance . " " Oh , you should ! " the man replied . " You absolutely should . " Each sentence was punctuated by intervals of silence , and though Ellen would have poked her eyes out rather than look , her curiosity was piqued . What -- precisely -- were they doing ? She leaned farther to the side , discovering that the ribald scene was every bit as tawdry as she 'd envisioned . The couple were wrapped around each other so completely that they might have been glued together . The woman was a short , buxom brunette , while the man was tall -- six feet at least -- with a fit , muscled physique . He had dark hair , and though Ellen could n't see his face , she was sure he 'd be handsome as the devil . He was cupping the woman 's buttocks , and as they writhed and wrestled , Ellen rippled with equal parts disgust and exhilaration . Do n't watch ! she scolded , declining to be drawn in to the squalid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior , she 'd viewed such licentious conduct -- as a girl in the forest when she 'd glimpsed Lord Stanton -- and evidently , naught had changed since that shameful day . Maturity had neither bestowed wisdom nor granted heightened judgment . She was as intrigued as ever by sexual endeavor . What was the matter with her ? At twenty-eight , she was resigned to her situation . Circumstances had guaranteed that she would never marry , so why was she enthralled ? Was she secretly pining for a beau ? Had she a lusty aspect to her personality to which she was oblivious ? How peculiar ! How terrifying ! She 'd often heard that a woman needed to wed , that -- after a certain age -- it was unhealthy to shun matrimony . She 'd always scoffed at the prospect , but what if the stories were correct ? What if she had a buried need for male companionship ? What if it became worse with time ? Could she grow crazed from unfulfilled desire ? " We really should n't be dallying , " the woman contended . " But I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This could be my last chance . You would n't ask me to pass it up , would you ? It 's like ordering a starving man to ignore a feast , a thirsty man to walk by an oasis . " Ellen rolled her eyes . She had n't had much experience with men , her deceased father and her tormented brother , James , being the two main examples , but she recognized the statement for the banal remark it was . What sane female would succumb on the basis of such drivel ? If Ellen were the one being seduced , she 'd insist on something a tad more romantic ! " So . . . my participation would be an act of kindness ? " the woman queried . " Think of it as your Christian duty to a deprived soul , " he advised . " As I said , it may be my only opportunity . " " Then we should n't waste it . " Instantly , the tryst was pitched to the next level . They were kissing with a mutual fervor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , a heel anchoring him as she stroked her foot up and down his calf . His crafty fingers were fondling her bosom and ultimately slithering under her clothes to caress and pet . With a smooth yank , he tugged at the bodice so that a breast was bared . He pinched and squeezed ; then , stunning Ellen to her very core , he dipped down and sucked at the nipple . The gesture was so surprising , and so unexpected , that Ellen clamped her hand over her mouth , lest she gasp aloud . Though she 'd previously seen Lord Stanton frolicking , and thus assumed herself an expert in libidinous affairs , that assignation had entailed a great deal of enthusiastic kissing and hugging , but nothing similar to this . She was so nave ! She 'd had no idea that a man would do such a thing to a woman , that a woman would enjoy it , and her body responded with an impatient zeal . Her breasts were inflamed , her nipples throbbing , and she suffered from the strongest urge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was so hot that she worried she might ignite , and she could scarcely keep from fanning herself . The lovers were next to a fancy sofa , and they lay down and stretched out , so they were shielded from sight . Ellen could n't see what was transpiring , but there was heavy breathing , sighs and murmurs , more rustling of fabric . What was occurring ? How frustrating to have her analysis stymied by a piece of furniture ! She was desperate to know all , her salacious tendencies raging , and she had to physically grip her chair so that she did n't sneak over for a closer look . " Oh . . . oh . . . " the woman panted . " Oh . . . Stanton , you 're so good at that ! " Stanton ! The annoying Romeo was Lord Stanton ? The swine ! As if she 'd been doused with icy water , Ellen jerked to reality . Fury replaced curiosity . How could she not have guessed it was he ? Over the years , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed them all . He was a wastrel and rou , who trifled with any willing female , but beyond his profligate habits , Ellen was positive he was a liar and perhaps a thief , as well . That fated summer , when he 'd been loafing in the country , a countess 's ring had been stolen . In Ellen 's opinion , everyone who 'd been staying at the manor was a suspect -- Stanton included -- but her sixteen-year-old brother , James , had been accused instead . He 'd been naught more than a boy , the estate agent 's son , and he 'd been sentenced to twenty years hard labor and transported to the penal colonies . The disgrace and shock had killed their widowed father , so Ellen had been left all alone in the world to fend for herself . Her cherished family had been ruined by the calamity , and she blamed Alex Marshall and his affluent friends . Plus , he was engaged to Rebecca ! Since he 'd been too lazy to arrive on time , she was down the hall , entertaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join them for supper . He was too busy dishonoring himself with every hussy in attendance ! Ellen was so angry that if she 'd been holding a pistol , she 'd have marched over , aimed , and shot him through the middle of his black heart . So far , she 'd remained hidden , but she was finished with wallowing in the corner . If Stanton presumed he could behave so despicably toward Rebecca , he was in for a surprise . He was n't going to philander ! Not if Ellen had anything to say about it . His wicked ways were about to end ! She reached for her cards , split them in half , then shuffled -- slowly and loudly -- each card falling with a determined snap . It was a new deck , the paper crisp and stiff , and it made a brittle noise that echoed off the high ceiling . Across the room , the woman hissed , " What was that ? Did you hear it ? " After a brief hesitation , Stanton replied , " No . " There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuffled again , and she started to hum , stridently and out of tune , but impossible to disregard . Lord Stanton 's head popped up over the edge of the couch . " What the devil ? " " Stanton ? Is that you ? " Ellen asked , acting as if they 'd been acquainted forever , which , in an odd way , they had been . " I had n't realized anyone was in here but me . " " Who are you , " he barked , " and what are you doing in my library ? " " I 'm playing solitaire , " she answered evenly , " but it 's so boring . Would you care to let me beat you at another game of gin ? It 's been an eternity since I 've taken any of your money . " She was fibbing -- they 'd never socialized in the past -- but it was amusing to pester him . " Gin ? " he sputtered . " You want to play . . . gin ? " " Unless you 'd like to suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scowled at Ellen , gazed down at his Jezebel , scowled at Ellen , then grumbled , " Bloody hell . " The woman pushed at him , tossing him on the floor in her frenzied effort to right herself . In seconds , they were both standing , their backs to Ellen , as they straightened clothing and tucked in bodily parts . Ellen rose and sauntered over , only to ascertain that she knew the woman -- the circles of the Quality were quite small -- and , she hoped , to shame her into better conduct . " Why , hello , Mrs. Farthingale , " Ellen greeted with a cold calculation . " Have we met ? " Farthingale inquired . " Have you forgotten me already ? " Ellen prodded . " I 'm Rebecca Burton 's companion . " " You are ? " Farthingale gulped with alarm as Stanton muttered , " Dammit ! " " We were introduced when you were visiting her last autumn . " " Oh yes , " Farthingale claimed , clearly not recollecting at all . She paled . " How marvelous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though ? " " Alex . . . that is , Lord Stanton . . . was helping me with my dress . It . . . ah . . . came loose . " " Dresses can be so tedious , ca n't they ? " Ellen commented . " Like matrimony . " " We slipped away to . . . ah . . . to . . . " Farthingale halted . There was nothing she could say to extricate herself from the mess with any aplomb . " I 'll just be going , " she finally mumbled . " If you 'll excuse me . . . " She slinked away , groped at the key in the lock , then bolted into the hall . As she went , Ellen and Stanton were frozen in place , watching her flee , but once the door shut , Stanton whipped around . He advanced until they were toe-to-toe , until his boots dipped under the hem of her skirt . He towered over her , every inch of his six-foot frame aching to wring her neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 'd seen him from a distance and had figured he was handsome , but she had n't grasped how attractive he would prove to be up close . She was disconcerted , by his height , by his demeanor , by his blatant masculinity . He appeared dark and dangerous , his black hair swept off his forehead to reveal high cheekbones , an aristocratic nose , a sensual mouth . His shoulders were wide , his chest broad , his waist narrow , and he had lanky legs that were braced with fury . He was studying her , his blue , blue eyes roaming across her face and torso , and she was uncomfortable with the intoxicating scrutiny . She felt too short , too old , too skinny , too . . . too . . . ordinary , when she suddenly did n't wish to be . She yearned to confront him in a stylish sapphire gown that would match the color of her eyes and set off the blond of her hair . She craved silk gloves , a lace shawl , tasteful jewelry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where had it sprung ? Why would she pine to be all that she was not ? And for him , of all people ? She loathed him and all he represented . " What is your name ? " he seethed . " Miss Ellen Drake . " " How long have you been in here ? " " The entire time . " " Gin indeed , " he ultimately griped . " I 've never seen you before in my life . " " No , you have n't , " she agreed , grinning , " but you 've definitely seen me now . And " she arched a brow --  " I have seen you . " He loomed until there was no space separating them . She 'd never been so near to an adult male , so she had n't understood that the experience could be so invigorating . She reeled with excitement -- but dismay , too . She found him intensely intriguing , when she did n't want him to be , and she pulled away , which he would n't allow . He moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prey . " Are you threatening me , Miss Drake ? " " Not at all , Lord Stanton . I 'm merely stating the facts . " " To what end , you aggravating tart ? " " Tart ! " He snorted with derision . " There are a few other terms I could call you , but I do n't think I ought . " " Minding your manners , are you ? " He ignored the taunt . " What is your relationship to Rebecca ? " " As I said , I 'm her companion . " " She has no companion . " " Oh yes , she has , " Ellen asserted , " and if you do n't reform your scandalous behavior , I 'll notify her of what I 've witnessed . " He evaluated her again , searching for her petty secrets and apparently locating them all . He chuckled . " No , you wo n't . You 'd never hurt her . " " I would n't consider myself to be hurting her . I 'd be doing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . " " But I 'm the catch of the kingdom , " he mocked , " and Rebecca has me on her hook . " " You are so vain ! " He stepped in , and she stepped away . They were like a pair of dancers , gliding across the floor . They continued on until she bumped into his desk and could go no farther . She was wedged against the polished oak , her bottom perched on the edge , and he leaned in so that she was tipping over , and his firm palm between her shoulder blades was all that kept her from being prone . " You do n't like me , do you ? " he asked . " Not a bit , and I wish Rebecca did n't like you , either . " " Why , you arrogant , uppity --  " " Uppity ! " " How dare you malign me ! If you are who you say you are -- and I admit that I have grave doubts as to your veracity -- you 're living under my roof , employed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates that you have more audacity than anyone I 've ever met . I ought to talk with Lydia and have you fired . " " If you try , I can promise that my farewell to Rebecca will involve a vivid description of Mrs. Farthingale 's bosom . " Ellen did n't know where she 'd garnered the courage to spar with him , or why she was bent on provocation . He brought out her worst traits , making her bold and rash . Their wrangling gave her an exhilarating sense of power . She felt as if she could do any wild thing without repercussion . " Listen , you cheeky little --  " He paused in mid-insult and reined in his temper . With an undignified scoff , he sidled away . As if his cravat had shrunk and was choking him , he tugged at it . " How much ? " She sat up . " How much . . . what ? " " Do n't play dumb -- which you 're obviously not . What will it take for you to be silent ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes . " He shrugged . " I do n't want to upset Rebecca . Neither do you . So name your price . Cash ? Baubles ? A few new gowns from Madame LaFarge ? " She let her own gaze wander down . He really was a fine masculine specimen . How sad that so much low character could be wrapped in such a pretty package . She smirked . " Celibacy . " As if she 'd struck him , he blanched . " Celibacy ! " She was n't certain what celibacy entailed , but the mysterious deed included some of what he 'd been doing with Farthingale . " Yes . I would have your word on it . " " Not bloody likely . " She nodded , latching on to the idea with a particular relish . " It shall be celibacy till the wedding , and your complete devotion to Rebecca . Or else ! " " Or else what ? " Struggling for calm , he pinched a finger and thumb to the bridge of his nose . " Miss Drake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realize you 're a spinster . " He uttered spinster as if it were a vile disease , and she was incensed by the denigration . " By choice , Lord Stanton . Absolutely by choice . " " You probably hate all men . " " Not all , " she assured him . " Just some . " " I only meant that you 're in no position to fully grasp the nature of the male beast . " She glared at the couch where he 'd enjoyed his torrid embracing . " Actually , I think I grasp it quite well . " " I sha n't be officially engaged for another month , and the wedding wo n't roll around till six months after that . You ca n't expect me to . . . to . . . " " Ca n't expect you to what ? " A muscle twitched in his cheek . Murder gleamed in his eye , and she was positive he 'd have throttled her if he could have figured out how to conceal the crime . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead and tell her . Lay bare the entire sordid episode . I dare you . " " I will , " Ellen insisted . " I swear it . I 'm not joking . " " I 'm betting you are . " He assessed her , taking her measure , and she had the strangest impression that he knew everything about her , that he could read her mind . There was no way to keep him from discovering that she would never hurt Rebecca by passing on such terrible news . " Good evening , Miss Drake , " he stated . " I wo n't say it 's been a pleasure to make your acquaintance , because it has n't been , and if I 'm very , very lucky , I sha n't suffer the misfortune of speaking with you ever again . " She 'd lost the upper hand -- and so quickly , too !  - -  but she was determined to get it back . He seemed to have a genuine fondness for Rebecca , so perhaps she could use it to stir his dormant conscience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information will wound her ? " " I have many feelings for Rebecca , but they are none of your concern . Just as my personal affairs are none of your business . I am a man , Miss Drake . Not a eunuch . Go blackmail someone ethat deftly hurled slur , he strutted out , leaving her to dawdle in the quiet , to fume and stew about how weak she was . She 'd never had any control . Not over her fate . Not over her circumstances . Not over her income or her reduced status . She was dependent , beholden , alone , and the tedium of her situation reared up as though it were a living , breathing creature that was suffocating her . What she would n't give to be free and self-sufficient . She was like a slave who yearned to break out of bondage , and the fierce burst of discontentment rattled her . When had she grown so dissatisfied ? So unhappy ? Long ago , she 'd accepted her dreary lot . Had n't she ? Stanton was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she 'd seen . But if he thought she 'd let the matter rest , that she 'd ignore him as he gamboled with every strumpet in London , he was in for a huge shock . Celibacy she 'd demanded , and celibacy it would be . Stanton 's life was about to change -- drastically !  - -  and she was the one who 'd make it happen .
