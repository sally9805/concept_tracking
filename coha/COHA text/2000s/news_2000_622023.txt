<p> The warm-up acts have retreated behind the curtain and cleared the stage for the main attraction . Finally , after a six-month regular season and two rounds of playoffs stretched out like limousines , the Los Angeles Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers take their turn under the spotlight in the Western Conference finals . <p> The best-of-seven series opens tomorrow afternoon at Staples Center in Los Angeles , but do n't be fooled by the early lunch-time start of 12:30 p.m . The Lakers and Trail Blazers figure to stay late , roll up their sleeves and parcel out healthy portions of intrigue for the next two weeks . <p> The plethora of story lines reflect the magnitude of a such a series : Will the Lakers ' indomitable duo of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant trump Portland 's superior depth ? ( " Does quantity beat quality ? " Lakers coach Phil Jackson asked , leaving the query unanswered ) . <p> Can the Trail Blazers break through at Staples Center , where the Lakers are 6-0 in the playoffs and 23-1 in their past 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pippen with Jackson , his coach for six championships in Chicago , as they discussed during the offseason ? <p> And will Portland coach Mike Dunleavy , who guided the Lakers to the 1991 NBA Finals , spoil the championship run of his former employer ? <p> In a series with more angles than the Lakers ' triangle offense , and with each team boasting prohibitive matchup advantages at certain positions , the combatants are bracing for the long haul . <p> " Two powerhouse teams in the West , and one of us is going to eliminate the other to get to that big dance , " Portland forward Rasheed Wallace said . " It 's going to be a good matchup . It 's going to be a good fight . " <p> Said Bryant : " It 's going to be a nail-biting game , every single game . This is the type of series that can go either way . We 're both explosive teams , both can catch fire . " <p> The teams split four games during the regular season , with each winning once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season while Bryant was missing from the lineup because of a broken hand . ) Both brought 11-game winning streaks into their last meeting , a 90-87 victory by Los Angeles at The Rose Garden on February 29 , which sent the Lakers barreling toward the conference crown and sent the Trail Blazers bumbling into a funk that spanned nearly six weeks . <p> Portland has perked up in the playoffs and rediscovered the form that produced 45 victories in its first 56 games . The Trail Blazers withstood a first-round challenge from pesky Minnesota , before prevailing in four games , and then dismissed Utah in five . <p> " We struggled at the end of the season , but I think we 've come together in the playoffs , " Portland forward Detlef Schrempf said . <p> Along the way , an assertive Pippen has engaged his teammates in a game of follow-the-leader , a healthy Grant has sparked the second unit with his relentless energy and Wallace , for the most part , has subdued his feud with league officials . <p> Each of those developments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Portland could not only push the Lakers the distance , but maybe outlast them . In fact the Lakers , who won 67 games in the regular season and ripped off three double-digit winning streaks , have cast themselves publicly as the upstarts . <p> Jackson , never one to seek refuge from psychological warfare , said the Trail Blazers " underachieved " during their 59-23 regular season and possess " almost every attribute a coach could want . " Bryant acknowledged that Portland 's roster is stocked with " better players , " conceding that perhaps the Trail Blazers should be considered the favorites despite the Lakers ' home-court advantage . <p> " We seem to be the underdogs right now , which is perfect for me , perfect for us , " Bryant said . <p> Postseason perfection has eluded the Lakers , who were pushed to five games by Sacramento in the first round and suffered a humiliating defeat to Phoenix in Game 4 in the second round before closing out the Suns on Tuesday . <p> Of course , the Kings never threatened the Lakers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolong a series it trailed 3-0 . The playoffs are more about the ends than the means , the conquest than the beauty contest , and Los Angeles remains on schedule for its first title since 1988 . <p> Also right on cue , Dunleavy is posturing as if he were a fashion model . He has revived an oft-repeated lament from opposing coaches this week , insisting that O'Neal plays an illegal zone on defense and bullies defenders on offense without being whistled for charges . Dunleavy went as far as to hitch his team 's chances to the way in which the officials maintain control of the games . <p> " If he is allowed to push guys out of the way and gain his position , it 's going to be tough for anybody to beat them , " Dunleavy said . <p> LAKERS-BLAZERS REGULAR-SEASON RESULTS <p> . <p> Date/Place : 11/06/99 - Portland <p> Winner : Blazers <p> Score : 97-82 <p> Points Leader(s) : Shaq 21 <p> FT : L.A. 17-34 , Prtd. 20-21 <p> Highlight : Arvydas Sabonis scores 11 straight Blazers points shortly after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I let ( Shaq ) him know how unhappy I was that he did not contain himself .

" <p>  --  Shaquille O'Neal <p> AND THE EDGE GOES TO . . . <p> GUARDS : Five-foot-10 Damon Stoudamire , a streaky scorer who averaged 17.5 points versus the Lakers , could present problems for Los Angeles ' big guards , although Portland will struggle more in its quest to contain Kobe Bryant . Ron Harper lends Los Angeles his playoff savvy , while Steve Smith does the same for Portland , with more offensive punch . <p> EDGE : Lakers <p> CENTER : The Lakers ' Shaquille O'Neal averaged 20.5 points per game  --  nine below his season average  --  against Portland , which can rotate 290-pound Arvydas Sabonis , Rasheed Wallace , Brian Grant and , if necessary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabonis , who is capable of dragging all 315 pounds of Shaq out of the lane with his perimeter shooting and often initiates the offense with his deft passing , must avoid the foul trouble that plagued him in three of the four regular-season meetings . <p> EDGE : Lakers <p> FORWARDS : Assuming Shaq dominates his matchup in the pivot , Portland can counter by exploiting its decided edge at power forward . Like Sacramento 's Chris Webber , who burned the Lakers in the first round , the versatile Wallace will be a handful for A.C. Green and Robert Horry . Scottie Pippen has emerged as the Trail Blazers ' unquestioned leader , setting the tone defensively and showing a willingness to take the big shot . The Lakers are waiting for Glen Rice to provide more consistent scoring and relieve some pressure from Shaq and Bryant . <p> EDGE : Trail Blazers <p> BENCH : Portland can go 10-deep , bringing in Jermaine O'Neal and Grant to bang with Shaq , Greg Anthony for perimeter defense , Detlef Schrempf for experience and second-year guard Bonzi Wells for instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much , but Horry , Rick Fox and Brian Shaw will be called on to defend and make open 3-pointers when Shaq passes out of double teams . <p> EDGE : Trail Blazers <p> COACHING : Los Angeles ' Phil Jackson , whose Chicago Bulls beat the Mike Dunleavy-led Lakers in the 1991 NBA Finals , has the best postseason winning percentage in league history . Dunleavy lacks the championship success , but he has steadied Portland after a late-season slump and handled a deep team in which minutes are at a premium . <p> EDGE : Lakers <p> INTANGIBLES : The Lakers are 1-3 on the road in the playoffs , but their dominance at Staples Center ( 6-0 ) allows for a greater margin of error . The home-court advantage would likely prove decisive if the series extends to a Game 7 . <p> EDGE : Lakers <p> PREDICTION : Lakers in seven . <p> CHART : <p> SLIM DIFFERENCE The teams ' stats over their four-game regular-season series PPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG TPG Lakers 89.0 .413 .281 .656 44.0 17.8 7.75 6.50 12.8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
