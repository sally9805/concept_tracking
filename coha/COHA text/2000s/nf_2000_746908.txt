Section : NEXUS Ethics , Law , and Management <p> For millennia physicians have been admonished to " comfort , always " and " first , do no harm , " or primum non nocere . Further , the Hippocratic oath severely constrained the physician 's actions regarding a patient 's death : " I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it , nor will I make a suggestion to this effect " ( Beauchamp and Walters 1999 ) . Thus , the Hippocratic ethic precluded physicians from actively euthanizing patients , with or without their consent , as well as assisting in a suicide . This meant that the historical role of physicians was to provide palliation for pain and the comfort care needed to make dying as peaceful as possible . It was always suspected that some physicians hastened dying at a patient 's request , or sometimes without it . This sub rosa aid in dying rarely reached the level of public debate . As I suggested in the last Nexus column , however , that has changed . Futility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of life . In a real sense futility theory returns physicians to their traditional role because it does not state that active euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide is condoned or acceptable . Physicians are expected to recognize the limits of medicine , to dissuade , and to withhold or withdraw interventions from patients who can not benefit from them . <p> Futility theory has quantitative and qualitative aspects that focus on the absence of probable benefit from continued treatment . As futile care is generally defined , physicians make a quantitative determination based on the probability of success if a treatment were attempted or continued . The patient or a surrogate makes the qualitative determination by assuming that treatment will be successful and asking the further question whether the resulting quality of life would be such that treatment ought to be undertaken . <p> As measured by the number of articles in the professional literature , the intense debate regarding medical futility began in 1987 , peaked in 1995 , and has declined since . The courts have not generally recognized the concept of futile care , likely because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles , such as defining futility or establishing an empirical basis for deciding when care is futile ( Helft , Siegler , and Lantos 2000 ) . Thus , the problem of decision making about treatments that have minimal benefit is unresolved . BACKGROUND <p> In many respects futility theory is old wine in new bottles . Its origins lie in the concepts of ordinary and extraordinary care , which are distinguished by " hope of benefit " and " excessive expense , pain , or other inconvenience . " These distinctions make it ethical to withhold or withdraw any medicine , treatment , or operation that offers no reasonable hope of benefit or that can not be obtained or used without excessive expense , pain , or inconvenience . <p> The issue of futile care arises when patients or their surrogates demand care that clinicians consider to be hopeless . Two examples involved decision making by surrogates . One was the case of Helga Wanglie , who was in a persistent vegetative state . Her husband demanded that all efforts be made to keep her alive , despite a prognosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baby K , a newborn with anencephaly ( major part of the brain missing ) whose mother refused to authorize a do-not-resuscitate order and insisted that all treatment continue . <p> Health services organizations and their physicians may also insist on futile care . The cases of Karen Ann Quinlan and Nancy Cruzan also involved surrogate decision making . In those cases , however , the surrogates sought to have life-sustaining care withdrawn , but hospital policy ( Quinlan ) and state law ( Cruzan ) prevented their wishes from being met . Thus , futility policies can be as important to health services organizations as they are to patients and families . DEFINITION <p> The futility concept has been narrowly described as a unilateral do-not-resuscitate ( DNR ) order  --  a decision made by the physician using a physiologic definition ( Waisel and Truog 1995 ) . Some futility policies are much broader . Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center has defined futile care as <p> Any clinical circumstance in which the doctor and his consultants , consistent with the available medical literature , conclude that further treatment ( except comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure , ameliorate , improve or restore a quality of life that would be satisfactory to the patient . ( Hudson 1994 , 28 ) <p> The first two-thirds of this policy is clinical and seeks to quantify the futility of continued care . The last third is patient focused and adds a subjective criterion  --  a value judgment : " a quality of life that would be satisfactory to the patient " ( emphasis added ) . The two portions conflict . If the quality of life is satisfactory to the patient , regardless of how poor others might consider it to be , clinical judgments that further treatment is futile are irrelevant . The two parts of the policy are reconcilable only if physicians act paternalistically and decide that a certain quality of life would be unsatisfactory to the patient . <p> The policy at Santa Monica is implemented in several steps : informing the competent patient and family about the illness , options , and prognosis , emphasizing that the patient will be given all other support ; providing names of consultants to give an independent opinion ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; involving the ethics committee , as appropriate ; and giving sufficient time for the patient and family to consider the information . If , after these steps , the family is unconvinced , " neither the doctor nor the hospital is required to provide care that is not medically indicated , and the family may be offered a substitute physician ... and another hospital ... " ( Hudson 1994 , 28 ) . Most significant is the final step : " If it is determined that the patient can no longer benefit from an acute hospital stay and the patient insists on staying , or the family insists that the patient should remain , the mechanism for personal payment can be invoked " ( Hudson 1994 , 28 ) . The policy concludes with examples of futile care : irreversible coma or persistent vegetative state ( PVS ) ; a terminal illness , where applying life-sustaining procedures would only artificially delay the moment of death ; and permanent dependence on care in an intensive care unit . <p> The policy 's last step is economic  --  the hospital can bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That harsh measure is likely to be used infrequently because third parties cover hospital services . That is especially true for Medicare , where most cases of futile care are likely to occur . In addition to legal implications , such a policy raises public relations and political issues . <p> A more limited approach is found in a model policy that only addresses use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) . It is argued that the focus on CPR is appropriate " because it is the only intervention that requires consent for an order to withhold it ; other futile interventions are typically not offered or discussed " ( Tomlinson and Czlonka 1995 , 28 ) . The model policy gives no attention to other types of treatment , which may be futile as well . Because judgments about quality of life are not included , the policy has the appearance of being less value-laden and subjective  --  thus , it is hoped , simplifying its application . The primary focus is medical judgment , which is supported by professional integrity  --  the need to follow the values of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the decision that CPR is futile does not diminish the patient 's autonomy because ( a ) since it is futile to apply CPR , the patient has no real choice about whether it should be attempted and ( b ) the patient 's right to autonomy is limited by the rights of others , which are infringed when CPR is futile . The model futility policy makes no attempt to define futility : " A workable futility policy , therefore , can not be a policy that imposes a definition on practice . It must instead be a policy that creates a process for negotiating and developing , case by case , a consensus on the rightful limits of patients ' demands for treatment " ( Tomlinson and Czlonka 1995 , 33 ) . IMPLICATIONS <p> Futility theory goes well beyond the contemporary concept of autonomy . Generally , patient autonomy has been defined as a negative right  --  the right to be free from unwanted treatment , to be able to say no . Futility theory limits what is argued to be a positive right : to demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit to receiving it . From a philosophical standpoint it is arguable that no such positive ethical right exists . To be realized , such claimed rights require that someone  --  often government  --  be made responsible for providing the needed resources . And , as noted above , because a futile application of medical treatment is not really a choice , patient autonomy is not diminished . <p> Depending on how it is applied , a futile care policy can be an aggressive approach to issues of extraordinary , disproportionate , and burdensome care . The Santa Monica policy states that there is a need to educate and inform the patient . The patient or surrogates need not concur in the decision . That is quite different from the ideal of shared decision making  --  a nonpaternalistic physician-patient relationship , which is reflected in Tomlinson and Czlonka 's model futility policy . As suggested above , the problem that futility theory purports to address may be only partly attributable to patient demands . <p> Research findings document many shortcomings in the care of seriously ill , dying patients , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUPPORT researchers are compelling : <p> ( The ) Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments patients were seriously ill , and their dying proved to be predictable , yet discussion and decisions substantially in advance of death were uncommon . Nearly half of all DNR orders were written in the last 2 days of life . The final hospitalization for half of patients included more than 8 days in generally undesirable states : in an ICU , receiving mechanical ventilation , or comatose . Families reported that half of the patients who were able to communicate in their last few days spent most of the time in moderate or severe pain . ( SUPPORT Principal Investigators 1995 ) <p> These results occurred in the intervention phase of the SUPPORT study , despite the presence of nurses whose task it was to improve communication and encourage the patient and family to engage in an informed and collaborative decision-making process with a well-informed physician . The authors concluded that more proactive and forceful measures to establish communication and encourage collaborative decision making may be needed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400,000 admissions per year in the United States . Such findings bolster the seemingly harsh approach used in the Santa Monica futility policy . There is reason for caution , however . <p> In a corollary to the first phase of SUPPORT , investigators examined the impact of prognosis-based futility guidelines on survival and hospital length of stay for a cohort of seriously ill adults . They calculated the hospital days that would not be used if , on the third day , life-sustaining treatment had been stopped or not initiated for patients with an estimated two-month survival of 1 percent or less . They found that only 10.8 percent of hospital days would have been forgone and concluded only modest savings would have resulted ( Teno et al . 1994 ) . <p> If large numbers of patients demand futile care , guidelines limiting or preventing delivery of futile care will have several important effects . Voluntary ( patient or surrogates have consented ) passive euthanasia will exist in theory but will rarely be needed . Second , involuntary ( patient or surrogates have not consented ) passive euthanasia could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a means by which physicians feel that they are relieved of the obligation to talk to their patients or surrogates . Finally , the current system that requires physicians to obtain consent before withdrawing life-sustaining treatment would have to be reconsidered . <p> The contradiction between medical science and quality of life in the Santa Monica definition of futile care suggests that a paternalistic quality-of-life decision may be masquerading as scientific , objective decision making . This may reflect an unrecognized return to the physician paternalism of Hippocrates , a change that needs to be considered independently . <p> Clinically , the most compelling ethical issue raised is that futile care policies may put health services organizations and physicians on a slippery slope . Will these policies become broader and more focused on the quality of life that clinicians ( and perhaps managers ) determine would be unacceptable to the patient ? Questions such as this can be answered only in retrospect , in itself not a cheery prospect . DEVELOPING FUTILE CARE POLICIES <p> Health services organizations should address several issues when developing a futile care policy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data showing that many patients or surrogates are demanding care that physicians consider futile , futility policies may be solving a nonproblem . This is especially true given the published cases of patients forced to accept care . To the extent that futility theory has an economic dimension , the SUPPORT investigators ' findings that " futile care " has a limited financial impact should be explored further . In addition , the psychic and emotional benefits and costs of continued care that clinicians have deemed futile can not be ignored . The current assumption about futile care is that it is only negative ; a broader calculus might , however , find countervailing positive aspects to care that is judged to be clinically futile . Concurrent with developing a futile care policy , initiatives such as making education on advance directives more effective and increasing the likelihood that they will be part of the medical record should be undertaken . <p> One solution in developing a policy is Santa Monica 's  --  patients or surrogates must agree to discontinue treatment that physicians have determined is futile . Complementing that alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and surrogates understand the prognosis . Objective predictions of survival or probability of good result , such as the APACHE ( Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation ) system , can assist decision makers ( patients and surrogates ) to understand the best course of action . APACHE predicts probable outcomes of treatment using physiological variables ; the data assist everyone in the decision-making process . <p> A second solution is identifying community values and applying them as a community standard  --  something health services organizations could do singly or as a group in a communitywide effort ( Sabatino 1992 ) . Here , the underlying concept is that of protecting the " commons " or the commonweal , the contemporary manifestation of which , communitarianism , means recognizing resource limits and cooperatively working within them . <p> A third , more long-range solution is to change the presumption about care in cases of PVS and terminal illness . Currently , it is presumed that care must be provided absent directives to the contrary . That presumption , reflecting Baconian theory about science conquering nature , has been reinforced by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Hippocratic tradition ( Jecker 1991 ) . The presumption should be that care will be provided if there is a probability it will benefit the patient , or in other words , the care contemplated is not futile . <p> Importantly , a futile care policy will provide guidelines and support for physicians , who will benefit from an organizational definition of futile care . In turn , the policy may help convince patients or surrogates that treatment without hope of benefit should be stopped . A consensus that seems to be developing , however , is that a judgment that further treatment would be futile " should initiate the difficult task of discussing the situation with the patient .... Talking to patients and their families should remain the focus of our efforts " ( Helft , Siegler , and Lantos 2000 , 295 ) . To that end the American Medical Association recommends a process-based approach to futility determinations , which begins with joint decision making using outcomes data and value judgments . The process includes at least four steps involving all parties in deliberations and efforts at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irreconcilable differences , and a final step to achieve closure when alternatives have been exhausted ( Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs 1999 ) . ROLE OF THE MANAGER <p> As with most ethical issues that have a significant clinical component , managers play a unique role in questions of futile treatment . Managers tend to be seen by external stakeholders as guardians of the organization 's economics . Although that is true for macroallocation decisions , it is the day in , day out microallocation decisions made by clinicians for individual patients that will determine the economic survival of organizations increasingly constrained by reimbursement systems . <p> First , managers must recognize that " futile " is inherently a value judgment . What is futile for one patient may be acceptable for another . Second , the health services organization must have a clearly developed and implemented statement of values on which a futility policy and subordinate processes are based . As indicated above , the presence of a policy and a process based on the policy gives a sense of purpose and direction that will be helpful in resolving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a theme that runs throughout policy formulation and process implementation , is that senior management must commit the resources necessary to have an effective ethics committee and the staff required to resolve the conflicts about futility that arise . CONCLUSION <p> Even though the ethics of futile treatment is no longer getting intense attention , the issue will continue to simmer beneath the surface . It is incumbent on all health services organizations to address the issues that futile treatment raises so that physicians and patients have a framework and resources that can aid decision making . The manager is the catalyst that can bring that about . <p>
