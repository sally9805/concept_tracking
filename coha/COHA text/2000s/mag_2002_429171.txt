COLLEGE FOOTBALL ROSE BOWL Headnote With unassuming coach Larry Coker at the controls , the Miami machine Is back on top and ready to stay there // Sheer terror , that 's what it should have been . But Larry Coker was n't walking from this precarious perch , this freezing jolt to his senses . This could n't be too tough . Shoot , he 'd seen just about everything in less than a year , anyway . He was n't the first choice as the new coach of the Miami Hurricanes , a prime job but one burdened by emotional baggage and BCS disappointment . It was his first head coaching job after more than 20 years as a college assistant , and he was handed a ready-made championship team with don't-screw-up instructions . He was , you might say , set up to fail . Yet this looming liquid hell was more intimidating . It was also a microcosm of Coker 's grand plan : the rebirth of a dynasty . A family , a bond , a quest So he jumped into a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arcticcold-water with a bunch of 300-pound linemen . It was their weekly post-practice ritual , a way to soothe and soak the pain and pressure of playing for it all . He laughed and joked while his heart pounded in his chest and his extremities lost all feeling-a 53-year-old coach who looks like he 's 63 , surrounded by blocks of ice , water and hulking , happy lugs . And you better believe it was worth every damn second . " He is one of us , " Bryant McKinnie , Miami 's mammoth offensive tackle , says of Coker . " You have no idea what that means . It 's beginning to come into focus . The Miami administration threw the keys to Coker last January and told him to keep the engine revving . After last week 's Rose Bowl , the Ferrari is purring on premium . Nearly 20 years after the first Miami dynasty strutted and sauntered into the college football limelight with a stunning victory over Nebraska in the 1984 Orange Bowl , the second coming debuted with a 37-14 cakewalk over Big Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sequel is n't as good as the original ? " These guys have something special here , something more than what we had , " says Cortez Kennedy , a former Miami All-American defensive tackle and a founding member of the first dynasty . " It 's only going to get better . " It 's better because the only similar characteristics with this group and the original dynasty that won four national titles from 1983-91 are talent on the field and the ability to wield the hammer in big games . The old " Canes had speed and playmakers and attitude . So do the new " Canes . But that 's where the similarities end . The first dynasty had vagabond coaches  --  Howard Schnellenberger , Jimmy Johnson and Dennis Erickson have had seven jobs between them since leaving Miami-always looking for greener pastures . Now the " Canes have a coach who drives a 1979 Mercedes with a patchy interior and a crackling AM radio , and who could n't even fathom leaving his dream job . The first dynasty had players firing weapons from dorm windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The second coming has players such as tailback Frank Gore , one of the nation 's most dynamic freshmen , who chose Miami because Coker promised him the university would institute the necessary programs to help Gore develop academically despite his learning disability . The first dynasty had a mentality of selfishness that trickled down from coaches to players . They were as bad as they were good , and they were n't afraid to show it . A prime example : It took Schnellenberger all of one offseason to realize he wanted out after winning the first national title following the ' ' 83 season . He bolted Coral Gables for the-ahem-USFL franchise in Miami ( it never materialized ) , and finally admitted this past offseason that leaving Miami was " a horse- decision . " Photograph Photograph Johnson , who led all receivers with 199 yards on seven catches in the Rose Bowl , is part of an up-and-coming group of Hurricanes wideouts. // The second coming has Coker , a bald , bland Oklahoman who looks more like your grandfather than the glue and gumption of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tulsa job twice . And when Butch Davis left Miami less than a week before national signing day last year , the administration did n't want any part of Coker , either , initially looking to Wisconsin 's Barry Alvarez and Miami Dolphins coach Dave Wannstedt , offering the latter a 10-year , $20 million deal . The " Canes eventually settled for Coker , the players ' choice , for a scant $500,000 . Coker has n't made a wrong decision since . " They 're at the point now where you know winning the whole thing means you 're going to have to beat them , just like it used to be , " says Florida State coach Bobby Bowden , whose team took over as college football 's kingpin when the first Miami dynasty ran dry because of NCAA problems in the early 1990s . " What Larry has accomplished in such a short time is very impressive . " Here 's a coach who made self-deprecating jokes all season about your grandmother having the ability to step into his job and not screw it up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine , when in reality he made it go . Coker began his tenure , and Miami 's drive to its first national title since 1991 , by making the most important decision of his coaching career . Instead of going outside the program to find coordinators , he hired 30-something newbies Rob Chudzinski ( offense ) and Randy Shannon ( defense ) to steer the ship . Neither had coordinator experience , which fit nicely with Coker , who had no head coaching experience . Somehow , it all fit and blossomed beyond even Miami 's high expectations . Photograph It was a precious win for Dorsey ( left ) , Portis and the " Canes , whose last title came in 191. // By the end of the season , the offense set the school record for points ( 475 ) , and the defense led the nation in interceptions and forced turnovers and gave up a measly 9.3 points per game . That was after both sides lost two first-round picks from the previous season . It all culminated at the Rose Bowl , where the " Canes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and played keep-away in the final 30 minutes before a wild and emotional postgame celebration . There were questions all week as to who should 've been playing Miami in Pasadena-Nebraska , Oregon , Colorado  --  but there was one clear answer on that chilly Southern California night . " You can talk about who should 've been here all you want , " Miami safety Ed Reed says . " It does n't matter . Whoever was here would 've gotten the same treatment . " Photograph Crouch ( above ) , a popular target of the Miami defense , accounted for 176 of Nebraska 's 197 offensive yards ; counterpart Dorsey ( right ) collected 362 yards passing . // Guess what ? It 's only going to get worse for the rest of the nation . The " Canes look primed for another run of championships . Miami has n't lost since September 2000 , and without the moronic meddling of the BCS computers , the Hurricanes would have played Oklahoma in last year 's title game . In short , the " Canes conceivably could be working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright as it has ever been . College football is as much about recruiting as it is gameday performance , and Miami has locked up South Florida-the prime area in the prime state in the nation for high school football-with Shannon and Chudzinski . Shannon and strength coach Andrew Swasey , both blacks and both Coker hires , have helped the " Canes recruit elite black student-athletes . Chudzinski is chalk white , but he 's as hip as hop and is one of the best recruiters in the game . The combination has Miami winning battles on and off the field . " You 've got a staff there with four black assistant coaches , and it 's a young staff overall , " says one Florida high school coach . " These guys relate to the kids ; they 're not much older . ( Coker ) has made a lot of good moves since he was hired . Not only are ( Shannon and Chudzinski ) two fantastic coaches , they 're fantastic recruiters . " That , more than anything else , is where the dynasty is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and early ' ' 90s because it was able to sustain its hold on the state of Florida and still pluck top recruits from around the nation . When the NCAA sanctions hit in the mid- ' ' 90s , the " Canes lost scholarships , the talent dwindled and the dynasty crumbled . It 's just that simple . Players , any coach will tell you , win games . Not coaches , not schemes , not tradition . That 's why Miami 's future looks so bright . The " Canes could lose as many as six players from their record-setting offense-including three offensive linemen , junior tight end Jeremy Shockey and junior tailback Clinton Portis-and still be as dangerous as ever . Quarterback Ken Dorsey , who cut up Nebraska in the title game and was a Heisman Trophy finalist , returns with a rising group of wideouts , including Andre Johnson , Kevin Beard and Ethenic Sands . Photograph // Even if Portis leaves , Gore is set to step in . In fact , many at Miami believe Gore could be the program 's best tailback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of only four freshmen to play this season for Miami . And as long as we 're looking down the road , consider this juicy nugget : Dorsey 's replacement after the 2002 season could be Brock Berlin , the 1999 high school player of the year who seems ready to transfer from Florida . The defense likely will lose the entire secondary ( including junior cornerback Phil Buchanon ) to the NFL , but it still will have the best front in the nation with ends Andrew Williams and Jerome McDougle and tackles Vince Wilfork and William Joseph . Linebackers Jonathan Vilma , D.J . Williams and Howard Clark also return , and projected starting corners James Scott and Al Marshall both have the size and speed to thrive in Shannon 's aggressive scheme . If that is n't enough , the special-teams duo of All-American kicker Todd Sievers and punter Freddie Capshaw returns . " A lot of good players , " Nebraska quarterback Eric Crouch said after the Rose Bowl . " They were running backups in and out and not losing anything . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2002 seems to be the schedule , which includes nonconference road games against Florida and Tennessee . Then again , when Miami was rolling through the first dynasty , it did n't matter who was in the way . Why should it now ? " Everyone wondered how long it would take to get back to this point after the sanctions , " Coker says . " We 've got it going in the right direction now . " The same direction the " Canes were pointing to all season after last year 's BCS snub . The players called it " the " Ship , " as in , we 're headed for the national championship . Minutes after the Rose Bowl victory and amid the hysteria of the postgame locker room , Coker led the team in an impromptu " Ship dance . This was unusual on two fronts : The players did n't know Coker knew anything about it , and they could n't believe what they soon saw . " He was shaking his booty , " says defensive tackle Matt Walters . " And to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It could n't have been any worse than the gyrations Coker made when he jumped into that barrel of ice water not so long ago . And you better believe it was worth every damn second . Photograph Nebraska could n't keep up with Miami , as safety James Lewis ( left ) proved on his interception return .
