Gene Wolfe says that when he finished his new novel , Knight ( due out next year ) , he found himself with time again to write some short fiction . Here we bring you one sample of his recent burst of storytelling . It appeared first in the online magazine The Infinite Matrix , but we could n't resist reprinting it . <p> IR BRADWEN , THAT FAMOUS paladin , had heard stories of the Hill of Glass in far-off Camelot . With Arthur 's leave , he had ridden far and sailed perilous seas . For seventy days thereafter it seemed the tale fled even as he approached it , for at every village men pointed to the place where rose the Sun , and swore it was but two days journey more - or three . Or a fortnight . And yet .... The tale gained substance at each new place . The size of the hill diminished . Likewise the difficulty of the lower slopes . It was not merely of glass , but of green glass of about the color of this leaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady from a remote country , gained a name : Apple Blossom . And when Sir Bradwen protested that neither he nor any other man in Christendom had heard of a lady so named , his informants merely shrugged , and declared that she ought to know - an argument he found difficult to refute . At length he encountered a merchant , a solid no-nonsense trader in wool and fleeces , who declared that he had seen the glass hill himself , and even conversed with the princess . " A smallish woman , " he continued , " with long black hair and big eyes . I prefer my women larger , and I like a bit more meat on them . But she 's very pretty if you care for the type . Delicate , you know . One of those oval faces . Young , I would say . Very young , and stolen from far Cathay . Daughter of their king and all the rest . Think you can climb a hill of glass , Sir Bradwen ? " " By Saint Joseph ! " Bradwen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oath . " I have not come this far to fail . " " Well said . " The merchant smiled as the point of his dagger carried half his chop to his mouth . " I like a young man of spirit . " " And he likes you , " Bradwen declared . And then , seeing that the merchant expected to be asked for a loan , " I have gold sufficient for my modest needs , you understand . I 've lands , and a castle that we wrenched from the Heathen Saxon . But in the matter of tidings I am poorer than any churl . May I ask how you came to speak with the princess ? " " With little difficulty , " the merchant replied , clearly relieved , " for I have been blessed with good ears and a good , loud voice . She was on the battlements , where she appears to spend a good deal of her time . The slope of the lower levels is easy , and there are crevices in the glass with bushes sprouting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels off at the top . " The merchant traced the outline of a bell with his hands . " So I was able to get pretty close , " he continued . " It 's not a large castle , and the walls are n't terribly high . I asked her name and so forth . She 's been enchanted , she says - a spell to replace her own tongue with ours . But anyone who rescues her can have her . The enchanter has promised her that . " Let 's see .... What else ? Well , the gates are open . I saw they were . She has food in there , she says , and springs of water and wine . Princess Apple Blossom 's her name , her father 's King of Cathay - " Sir Bradwen , who had heard these things before , nodded somewhat curtly . " And she wants to be rescued , " the merchant finished , not the least discomfited . " I told her I was n't a rescuer , that I was a married man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would try to find a rescuer and send him to her . " " You have succeeded , " Sir Bradwen declared . " I thought so . " A draught of ale washed down the rest of the chop . " Is there anything else I can tell you ? " " Yes , indeed . I assumed she was locked in her castle . You say the gates are open . Why does she not walk through them ? " The merchant shrugged . " I can but speculate , though speculation feeds me well enough . It may be that she hopes for rescue , and prefers that to death . You see , my bold and knightly friend , with each step beyond the gate the slope grows steeper . Perhaps she might take ten steps , perhaps two . I do n't know . But soon she would surely lose her footing , slip , and slide . The farther she slid the faster she would go . When she struck the stones and trees at the foot .... " He shrugged again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly full tilt into a wall of stone . For that matter , suppose that you were to ride at such a wall as you would a foe in the lists . " Sir Bradwen nodded thoughtfully . " Then one has only to reach the summit of the hill to enter the castle . " " So it appeared to me , " the merchant declared , " though I did not try it - or see anybody else try it either . Have you more questions ? " " One , certainly . How can I reach the hill ? " " Oh , there 's no difficulty about that . It 's hut a day 's ride . Go down the road tomorrow until you reach the ford of the Sart . Turn left . There 's a path along the river . " Sir Bradwen nodded . " Follow it . Keep your eyes to your left , away from the river . If the weather 's fair , you 'll have no difficulty at all . The glass flashes in the sunshine . if the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass-green hill with a small castle of gray stone at its top . " The merchant paused to clear his throat . " Tell Her Highness I sent you , will you ? I swore I 'd send somebody , and I 'd like her to know I kept my promise . " " I will , " quoth Sir Bradwen , " and I will rise next morning before the sky grows gray . " Which he did , waking both the sleepy grooms and his charger , saddling the latter and riding forth while the morning star still gleamed above the eastern horizon , his good sword at his side , his lance in his hand , and another morning star ( a weighty mace with a head of steel spikes ) dangling from his saddlebow . " For if I find Princess Apple Blossom half so easily as that merchant said I might , " he murmured to Saint Joseph , " I may climb her slippery hill and claim her by sunset . Assist me , and Joseph shall be our first-born son . " The sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ford of the Sart . To his left , narrow indeed but quite visible , stretched the path of which the merchant had spoken . Up it rode Sir Bradwen with a merry heart , and before tierce beheld a distant hill flashing in the sunshine . A little nearer , and he saw plainly that this dazzling hill was crowned with a small castle - scarcely more than diminutive keep - of gray stone . Nearer still , and his keen eyes made out a figure on the battlements , a maiden , he felt sure , with long dark hair . A maiden who tottered forward and back , wringing her hand at every step . Dismounting and dropping his reins on the ground , he took a certain wallet he had secured before leaving Albion from a saddlebag and applied the fine powder it contained to the soles of his boots . For a time it sufficed . He negotiated the lower slopes with little difficulty and was quickly seen by the maiden on the battlement , who waved a many-colored scarf so fine that sunlight freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger ! Greeting and welcome ! Should you be desirous of cushioned rest , delectable refreshment , cooling airs , and the attentions a humble maid overjoyed by the lightest smile from her courageous and ever-compassionate lord , be aware that all are to be found in this lowly dwelling which , should you wish it , will at once become your own . " He waved in return . " I am Sir Bradwen of the Forest Tower , Your Highness . Your friend the merchant sent me as your rescuer , as I had been seeking you earlier . I have ridden hard all the way from Camelot . I am a knight of Arthur 's table . Have you heard of us ? " He essayed another step , and finding it difficult indeed powdered his boot soles again . " Your glory , goodly , most generous lord , reaches to the stars , " replied the maiden on the battlement , " and now has attained even to my decayed dwelling , for I have seen you , radiant as the Sun and of clean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near to falling . " Your Highness , " he called , " I can climb no nearer . This slope is too steep , and grows even steeper farther up . Do not lose hope . I will return with some better means of ascent . " Although the face of the princess was still distant , he saw her joy fade . " This inconsiderable person sympathizes most deeply with your plight , " she called . " This bewildered and imprisoned maid had dared think it possible that her lord - that her I-lord ..... " " I will ! " he shouted , under his breath adding , " just not today . " There was a long silence between them , bridged only by desire . At last the princess called , " My lord , the wisest and most ingenious of men , has doubtless hit upon some sleight of noble simplicity by whose means this unexceptional person might regain her liberty ? " He shook his head . " As , for example , harnessing a hundred wild geese to a sedan chair ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass over banditinfested mountains . " " Unfortunately , " called Sir Bradwen , " I have no sedan chair , Your Highness . " " Conceivably one might befriend the Storm Dragon , who would in magnanimity lift one up , even as the daring Sho Mee was borne among clouds to behold the Earth ? " " Should I meet the Storm Dragon , " declared Sir Bradwen , " I will surely oblige him so long as the matter involves no virgins . I have never made his acquaintance , however . Nor have I the smallest notion where he might be found . " Silence reigned once again , until the princess ventured , " This least of all persons has the honor to claim membership in a family highly favored by the August Personage of Jade . She herself , a poor weak woman , has often laid her wretched petitions at the feet of the Queen of Heaven . Perhaps if you were to petition her exalted husband ... ? " " Of course ! " Sir Bradwen snapped his fingers . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . " With that brisk speed which optimism engenders , Sir Bradwen left the glass hill and returned to the village in which he had lodged the night before . There was no church there , but the villagers directed him to a chapel in the wood , not very distant . There he spent the afternoon and evening in prayer and retired , fasting , to the dubious shelter of a nearby bush . Of horse and sword , mail and helm , no trace remained . Clad in the single simple garment of the poor , he stood at the entrance to the workshop . Inside that shop a patient craftsman labored , drilling holes and pounding pegs into them at measured intervals . Leaving off his work , he straightened up . And their eyes met . In the village next day , he explained the contrivance he had been shown to an old peasant who knew some carpentry ; the old peasant made a model of it : a peeled sapling , with twigs pushed into little holes along both its sides . Later that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model to two young men he had selected . " Fell a tree , " Sir Bradwen explained , " a straight , slender one with a lot of boughs . Cut off most of those completely , but leave the stubs of a few . You would have something like this . " They scratched , and nodded slowly . " There ca n't be many trees with boughs all the way to the ground . I looked for some and could n't find any . But we can drill holes and pound cut-off branches into them where we need them . " There was a lengthy silence , after which one muttered , " Ya . " " Old Lenz here will take care of the drilling and pounding . Your tasks will be choosing the trees , felling them , and getting into place . " One ventured , " Oxen we will need ? It could be . " Sir Bradwen shook his head . " If you need an ox to move it , the tree 's too big . Cut slender trees . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it lies . The branches you trim . Then it you move . " Both muttered , " Ya .... " " Work hard , " Sir Bradwen said , " and I will pay you one lushberg per day , paid at the end of each day . " As he spoke he held up two lushbergen , and both young men exclaimed , " Ya ! " To which the one with the cast in his eye added , " We work hard ! " Days passed . The first pole had brought him nearer the princess indeed , but carried him only to a point at which the glass hill rose steeper still . A second pole , lashed to the first at the top , provided a base from which they raised a third . That third brought him so near that for the first time he was able to appreciate the beauty and the marvelous delicacy of her countenance . His whole being throbbed with longing for her - even as the longing in her own eyes , and the tears , broke his heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , " he told the old peasant . " We can mount another ladder-stick on that , tie it to the one we 've got up there already , and put a seventh on top of them . That should do it . " The old peasant nodded , his assistants mumbled , " Ya ..... in unison , and the great new work was begun . At two per night to the old peasant , and one each to his assistants , Sir Bradwen 's store of lushbergen had begun to run short . He took to the highroad to refresh it , and had the good fortune to encounter a merchant the very first day . " What ho , my bold knightly friend , " quoth the merchant . " Have you rescued the princess ? " " My campaign is well begun , " Sir Bradwen replied , " my troops advance even as we speak . We require , however , some small support from those well able to give it . May I count upon you for some trifling contribution ? " " Alas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression he had practiced and perfected . " My affairs go very ill . You spoke of a castle and lands when last we met . How I envied you , my bold knightly friend ! For I have neither . " " Your contribution need not be large , " Sir Bradwen explained . " A mere token of your support . What say you ? " The merchant sighed . " I can not . I must buy wool with the few pence I yet retain , and if I can not sell it at a profit I must starve . " " You appear remarkably well nourished at present , " Sir Bradwen remarked . " My difficulties , though very recent , are severe , " the merchant declared . " Will you let me pass ? " " Alas ! " Knowing that his own long face was wont to be interrupted by spasms of merriment , Sir Bradwen pulled down his visor instead . " Without a contribution , you may not pass this way . Doubtless there are other roads . There always are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . It is not as advantageous , however . It is longer , for one thing . For another , it has the ill luck to pass the castle of Gifflet le Fils de Do , lord of these lands . As a loyal freeman thereof , I should think myself obliged to report your obstruction of the more convenient route . " " I would enjoy the contest , " Sir Bradwen replied with perfect sincerity , " but before we engaged , honesty would oblige me to mention that I do not obstruct it , only seek to collect a trifling toll . Also that I am authorized to do so by a visiting princess , the daughter of the King of Cathay . Perhaps honesty would also oblige me to report that you were well appraised of these matters , and to ask whether you had communicated them in making your complaint . " " O my bold and knightly friend ! " the merchant replied . " We were truly friends only a fortnight ago . Is it not a shame that two Christians should thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sir Bradwen replied , taking his morning-star from his saddlebow and testing one of its points against his fingertip . " I rarely employ my dagger while on horseback , however , and I reserve my sword - a noble weapon with an attested relic of Saint Joseph in the pommel - for those well born . For the rest I employ this . " So saying , he rode hard at the merchant ; and when the latter raised his arm to block the expected blow , struck him with the lower edge of his shield , knocking him from his saddle . In a trice Sir Bradwen had dismounted as well , and seated himself upon the merchant 's belly . The merchant 's dagger he swiftly snatched from the merchant 's belt and flung into the bushes . The merchant 's large and weighty purse he then decanted onto the ground before him , an act accompanied by much chinking and chiming . When he had selected those coins he favored , he returned the remainder to the merchant 's purse ; and the merchant , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in chain mail , and had ridden a safe distance along the road , was surprised to find that his gold was intact only his brass lushbergen had been taken , with two Roman aeris , one denarius , and some other silver . The great day came at last . Four overlapping triangles supported similar poles forming two triangles of their own . These ( high up the glassy slope ) supported another two which with the addition of a bottom pole to brace them formed the final triangle that raised high the final pole - the one triumphantly climbed by Sir Bradwen , the one he stepped from where the slope was gentle enough . The one at the top of which Princess Apple Blossom met him , a perfect , dainty maiden a head and half shorter than he , perfumed and robed in magnificent brocade . The one at whose top they embraced and kissed , and kissed again and again . And yet again , until at last Sir Bradwen , fearing that he might be overwhelmed by his passion , suggested they go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hesitate to climb down for sweet modesty 's sake , I will carry you down . I can hold you with one arm , and we will stand upon honest clay in a trice . " At this the princess smiled . " If my exalted lord will consent , this beggarly person retains a few poor possessions , and my all-wise lord must surely know that we miserable ones who have nothing greatly value what little we have . There is my inconsiderable jade figure of the Queen of Heaven , to whom I have no joss to bum though she is dear to me . There is my second-best gown , a contemptible thing in the eyes of every beholder , yet precious to me . " " I understand , Your Highness , " quoth Sir Bradwen , " and shall have one of the men in my employ climb here and carry down these things . " The princess lowered her eyes in shame . " There is also my chop - my seal , perhaps ? Has this humble one committed some risible error , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And the ivory sticks with which I feed myself , the gift of my gently nurturing mother . Would my lord consent to view the debased quarters to which this wretched prisoner has been for three long years confined ? " " Eagerly , " Sir Bradwen replied , " if Your Highness will consent to show them to me . " " There is a magic box - " She smiled again , and he felt his love deepen . " Which may be opened only at certain times and behold ! it is filled with rice and fruits . if it can be opened now , is it possible that the most gracious lordly rescuer would consent to sample its poor contents ? " " I would , Your Highness . " Sir Bradwen bowed , for though he was eager to be gone he was far too well-bred to refuse the invitation of a princess . Together they went into the castle , she tottering and half-supported by his hand and arm ; and if their words were the stately ones of their time and their disparate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a woman and you - you are a man ! whispered the tiny hand ; and I am a man and you are a woman indeed ! replied the great one . Soon they stood before the box of which the princess had spoken , which was in fact a cabinet or locker set into one of the interior walls of her castle . She explained that the sun was now high - one of the times at which the box might be opened . She further described the food they might expect to find within it , and having received Sir Bradwen 's courteous consent , she touched the latch . At which the floor gave way beneath them , dropping nearly as fast as a falling stone . Together , she clutching him in terror , they descended into the hill of green glass . THEIR FALL SLOWED , and at length it halted altogether . Soft green light bathed them ; unguessable shapes surrounded them . " Welcome ! " a small voice cried ; and again , " Welcome ! " A very small man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached them riding in a silent and ugly little cart with invisible wheels . " The unconscionable and tricksy person you see before you , " whispered the princess , " is that very wicked magician who snatched me from the City of Peace . " Sir Bradwen bowed as he would have at Arthur 's court . " Perhaps we meet as antagonists , " he said politely , " yet I would much prefer to count among my friends a man so learned in all the ways of the Unseen World . You placed the lovely and royal lady at my side atop this mountain - " " To find us a man of the Dark Ages who showed a glimmer of intelligence , " the very small man in the cart replied . " She 's done it , too , as I knew she would . " He simpered , and seemed to be on the verge of laughter . " My name 's 12BFW-CY- , by the way , and I come from the remote future . " The knight bowed deeper still . " Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger sense of glorious Camelot . In a sense larger still , of Albion , the White Isle . " " This inconsiderable person , " the princess said , " is called by the unattractive name of Apple Blossom . She has been torn , as may be known , from the Land of the Black-haired People , Kingdom of Chin , a country well governed by the most illustrious person whose light dazzles these inferior eyes , her father , here styled King of Far-Off Cathay . " 12BFW-CY- 's smile broadened , becoming almost as wide as both the princess 's thumbs . " You wish to return home , I 'm sure . This knight has won you , though . He probably wo n't agree to it . " " On the contrary , " Sir Bradwen declared , " if this lovely lady can be returned to her parents in safety , I could wish for no happier outcome . I declare her - " His voice wavered , and he paused to clear his throat . " I declare her free to go at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At this , the princess clung more tightly than ever . " This wrwretched person , the m-m-most m-miserable of w-women , w-would w-w-would .... " She burst into tears . With his free hand , Sir Bradwen patted her shoulder . " There , there . Do not weep , Your Highness . You will be in the arms of your royal mother almost before you know it . Do you have sisters ? " " She has five hundred and twenty-six , " 12BFW-CY- put in somewhat dryly . " And six hundred and ten brothers . it was because she came of such an extensive family that we selected her - the removal of one very minor princess from so large a group is unlikely to result in historical - " " I w-want to st-st-stay here ! " wailed the unfortunate princess . " I ww-want to be in your arms ! " Sir Bradwen 's heart bounded like a stag . " Then you shall ! As long as my hand can grasp a sword , no one shall take you from me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holy Family ! By my honor and my mother 's grave ! " " Certainly not me , " 12BFW-CY- remarked dryly . " I do n't want her . As for your sword - " He tittered . " I am about to give you a more effectual weapon . " Sir Bradwen 's eyebrows went up . " Do you mean a magic bow ? An enchanted lance ? Something of that kind ? " 12BFW-CY- tittered again . " Precisely . It will enable you to overcome the most powerful opponent without fighting him at all . A little background must be filled in first , I think . If you 'll indulge me . " Hem , hem ! My companions - vile and selfish creatures with whom you would not wish to speak - and I represent a sizable fraction of humanity in the year thirty-two thousand three hundred and eleven . In another generation or two the human gene pool will be too small to support a viable race , even with all that genetic engineering can do for us , and humanity will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shredded , eh ? " " This fribbling person weeps , " declared the princess with feeling . To which Sir Bradwen added , " I 'm not sure I understood everything you said , the bit about the magic pool especially , but it sounded very bad . If my sword can be of service to you , you need but ask . " " Oh , we do n't mind . " 12BFW-CY- waved an airy hand . " We do n't mind at all . In a way we rather enjoy it . Our race has always been a filthy mess , you know , and we feel it 's high time we gave the daisies a turn at the hupcontroller . Now I 'll show you . Do n't be afraid . " Sir Bradwen was sorely tempted , but said nothing . " Here 's what we 've come up with , and very clever of us too , if I may say it . Of me , especially , which is why I get to talk to you two . " It was a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I wo n't point it at you , " 12BFW-CY- continued , " and if I did , I would n't turn it on . That would be too dangerous for you . But you may point it at other people , you see . It 's thought-controlled , of course , just like my car . Point it , think of it working , and you 'll see a crimson flash , very short . " Sir Bradwen nodded slowly . " Suppose an enemy knight comes into view . He does n't have to attack you . If you can see him , that 's plenty . You merely have to point my paciforcer at him , and think of him being paciforced . He will be incapable of any violence whatsoever , from that moment on . " Softly and involuntarily , the princess moaned . " Yes ! Yes , yes ! " 12BFW-CY- paused to clear his throat . But there 's hem , hem ! - more . The same holds true for his descendants . Or at least for any conceived after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't kill a chicken or bait a hook . And their own children will inherit the , er , tendency . If they have any . You appear troubled . " " I am , " Sir Bradwen conceded . " You see , Sir Magician , many of my foes are Arthur 's rebellious subjects . It is my task to return them to their loyalty , whether by killing them or by other means . With this ... ? " " Paciforcer . " " With this paciforcer they will be of no use to Arthur even if they renounce their rebellion . Knights and nobles who will not smite the heathen have no value . " " Why worry ? " 12BFW-CY- smiled . " In such cases you need not use it . But against the - ah ? " " Heathen . " " Heathen themselves .... Eh ? Eh ? " " I hesitate - " Sir Bradwen began . " Do not . " 12BFW-CY- held out the paciforcer , and edging his cart nearer , actually forced it into Sir Bradwen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline , this toothsome lady-will be restored to her family . I shall be compelled to use the paciforcer myself . On both of you . " Sir Bradwen bowed . " In that case , I accept . No price is too great . " " Good . Good ! " Sir Bradwen 's hand closed about the paciforcer . And 12BFW-CY- released it with a sigh . " An infinity of pain and suffering is thus wiped away . Human history will be infinitely more peaceful . Shorter , of course . Much shorter . But delightfully peaceful . My own generation will never have been . " For a moment he appeared radiantly happy . " We will have the oblivion we crave . Guard my paciforcer well . If it is not subjected to abuse , it will endure and continue to function for a thousand years . " " You may trust me , " Sir Bradwen declared , " to do the right thing . " " Then go . " 12BFW-CY- pointed down a long aisle between towering devices of sorcery , and suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the opening . " Blessings are without meaning , " 12BPW-CY- murmured , " and yet , and yet .... " " Farewell ! " Sir Bradwen told him , and flourished the paciforcer . The princess bowed until her hair swept the floor . " This submissive person makes haste to remove her loathsome self from your august presence . Ten thousand blessings ! " NO SOONER HAD SHE and Sir Bradwen left the glass hill than its opening shut behind them . A pleasant walk of a quarter mile ( over much of which he carried her ) brought them to the old peasant and his helpers . Sir Bradwen gave each of them a full day 's pay , though they had labored for less than half that . That done , he lifted the princess into his great war-saddle and mounted behind her ; and together they rode away until they reached the path beside the River Sart . There he took the paciforcer from his belt and flung it into the water . And the two of them rode on , upon a great white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing and Sir Bradwen whistling .
