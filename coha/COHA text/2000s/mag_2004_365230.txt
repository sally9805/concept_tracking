Chef Edgar Leal split his childhood between New York City and his hometown of El Tigre in rural Venezuela . That mix of Manhattan sophistication and Latin American tradition produced Cacao , which has quickly become one of Miami 's most popular restaurants . Owner Leal and wife Mariana Montero take the timeless dishes your abuela ( grandmother ) cooked , like seviche , tamales and bobo de camarao ( shrimp in cassava and coconut-milk sauce ) , and " deconstruct them , " as Leal says , into haute cuisine with a presentation that can be as much fun as Carnaval . They have coaxed surprisingly velvety textures and piquant tastes out of soups like black bean or fish sancocho . Dishes include duck escabeche with white-chocolate carrot mousse , right , and grouper braised with aji , a sweet Venezuelan pepper . Desserts are made from Venezuelan chocolate or fresh fruits , left . The result : a refreshingly classical approach to the often hypertrendy world of pan-Latin dining .  --  By Tim Padgett             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
