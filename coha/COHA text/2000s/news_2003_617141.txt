<p> Hyped on Marlboros and the supercaffeinated drink AMP , Louis Rush begins the day prowling EarthLink 's network for signs of the Alabama Gang , a furtive throng of spammers who spin millions of junk messages on accounts paid with stolen credit card numbers . <p> Rush is one of 13 investigators that Atlanta-based EarthLink employs to ferret out spammers and send their messages to the " bit bucket in the sky . " <p> " We are the original terminators , " says the 30-year-old . " We do not eat . We do not sleep . " <p> In an office building directly across from EarthLink 's headquarters on Peachtree Street , Pete Wellborn , a Georgia Tech football player-turned-hotshot lawyer , is working on a lawsuit against the Alabama Gang on EarthLink 's behalf . <p> Wellborn , known in legal circles as the " Spammer Slayer , " has built a national reputation for bringing high-tech spammers to their knees using one of the oldest laws in existence , trespass . He has taken the work personally since a spammer threatened to hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very nonlawyerlike manner what would happen to him if anything , anything happened to my dogs , " says Wellborn , 39 , an imposing figure in a buzz cut . <p> In Midtown Atlanta and other hot spots across the country , the war against spam is at full tilt . Lawmakers , prosecutors and consumer advocates are getting in on the action . None is throwing more resources at it than major Internet service providers , who have been snowed under by a phenomenal growth in junk e-mail in the past 24 months . <p> Collectively , they are spending hundreds of millions of dollars a year expanding their pipelines to the Internet and employing the best technological minds to develop software to block spam . <p> Amid all the talk of high-tech weaponry , Internet companies say that human beings with a passion for restoring e-mail to its junk-free days , such as Rush and Wellborn , are at the heart of their spam-fighting efforts . They have their work cut out for them . <p> * America Online , the country 's largest Internet provider , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.4 billion spam messages a day . AOL estimates that 80 percent of the e-mail flowing into its data center is spam , up from 50 percent in January . <p> * On its worst days , Atlanta 's BellSouth says 80 percent of its incoming mail is spam . It blocks most of that , but more than one or two spams a day is too much for most customers , says Dale Malik , a director with BellSouth 's Internet group , and the company 's point man on spam . " My customers do n't think of spam in percentages , " Malik says . <p> * EarthLink estimates half of the 3 billion messages it receives each month are spam . In May , the company introduced a software program that delivers the e-mail only from senders who respond to questions , proving they are human beings , not automated spam programs . The program supposedly blocks almost 100 percent of spam for users , but handling all of that rejected mail still costs the company money . " We have to spend the money to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful place , " says EarthLink CEO Garry Betty . " Otherwise , we do n't have a raison d'etre . " <p> * On a given day , Microsoft blocks 2.4 billion spam messages into its free e-mail service Hotmail . The company characterizes spam as the top subscriber issue and has pooled two dozen technologists and policy experts into a spam-fighting team . <p> Internet providers are far less concerned about the dollars spam is costing them , they say , than the prospect of losing angry customers . A recent study found that more than half of American e-mail users trust it less because of spam , while one in four uses it less . <p> " From our perspective , that is really frightening , " says George Webb , a business manager of Microsoft 's spam-fighting team . " In the longer term , if people stop using e-mail , that could be the really big cost we 're all going to have to face . " <p> For now , Internet providers have people like Rush , a big guy with a long ponytail who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hates it . " It kills innocent little electrons that could be used for other things , " Rush says . <p> He and his fellow investigators , based in Atlanta and Pasadena , Calif. , monitor EarthLink 's network virtually around the clock for hackers , virus spreaders and , of course , spammers . All major providers have similar teams , including BellSouth , which employs 14 investigators . <p> High-tech sleuthing <p> These guardians of the Internet do n't battle spammers , Rush says , so much as they tango with them . Sometimes the spammer leads , sometimes Rush does . " The tactics spammers use become more and more sophisticated , " Rush says . " We have to become more and more sophisticated . " <p> Rush begins his daily search for " Larry , Curly and Moe , " his moniker for the Alabama Gang , the most sophisticated spammers EarthLink has faced . Over six months , the gang blasted 250 million junk e-mails , employing computer tricks designed to baffle Rush and his colleagues . The company sued the spammers , naming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culprits . <p> Rush peruses outgoing e-mail that its filtering system flags as possible spam . The company also filters incoming spam from other networks . Rush 's blue eyes light up when he recognizes an alias used by one of the gang members in the " from " field . He examines the electronic path the message has traveled to narrow in on its point of origin . <p> Portions of e-mail are easily faked , including the " from " line . A forged identity is the telltale sign of a spammer , Rush says , akin to wearing a ski mask into a bank . <p> Spammers have all kinds of tricks . They know how to commandeer computers to send spam . Some junk e-mails spread viruses that turn unwitting home computers into spam churners . <p> A fellow investigator once traced the source of millions of spams to a personal computer serving as a restaurant 's cash register . The owner had no idea his computer had been possessed by a spammer . " He 's ringing up the Caesar salad and all the while spitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spam <p> Generally , Rush says , spammers , like crooks , have MOs . " Even with automated processes , people fall into a pattern  --  how they log in , how often , how long their connections are , " he says . <p> The major providers are exploring technical changes to e-mail that would make spamming harder . They also are wrangling over how to serve subscribers with diverse interests and varying ideas about what spam is . <p> Undermining their efforts is the lack of a universally accepted definition of spam . The most common is this : unsolicited commercial bulk e-mail . <p> To subscribers , that 's anything they did n't ask for , including pitches from their Internet providers hawking new software . A universal definition , Internet providers and lawmakers say , must be one that does n't undermine the growth of e-commerce . <p> The industry is looking for that balance . <p> Yahoo recently introduced a service that lets its paying subscribers train their computers to block spam based on their individual definitions . <p> Microsoft , which also is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its subscribers to identify e-mails they consider to be spam . So far , 5 million legitimate and spam messages have been fed into a database . " Using machine-learning technologies , our filter trains itself based on what users are telling it , " Webb says . <p> Often , Rush is arbiter . He examines the next e-mail caught in the filter : a pitch for dates with hot Hispanic women that is headed to 5,000 in boxes . Surely spam . Not so fast , Rush says . The sender is n't hiding his identity and gives recipients a legitimate way to stop future communication . " Might be a newsletter , " he says . Rush taps a few keys , quotes the line " fly and be free " from an episode of the ' 70s sitcom " Mork &; Mindy , " and sends the ladies on their way . <p> The next message  --  an offer for a porn site  --  suffers an altogether different fate . The pornographic content does n't doom it  --  EarthLink respects the right of its subscribers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been forged . " You 're going nowhere , " Rush says . <p> Typically , first-time spammers get warnings , Rush says . If they persist , they 'll discover that Internet companies cooperate with each other to cut their connections . <p> " Some people never get the message , " Rush says . " We will sue you for millions of dollars . " <p> That 's not just bravado . <p> Junk e-mail might have been just another avenue for Pete Wellborn to make a buck had a spammer left his dogs out of the fight . The Macon native shrugged off the insults , even the death threats . <p> But when a Dunwoody spammer Wellborn was suing called his home and threatened to harm his beloved mutts  --  Bandit , Jenni , Sadie and Bo  --  the Spammer Slayer got mad . <p> " I think he heard them barking in the background , " Wellborn says . Then the spammer said , " You really do need to drop the case . I know you would really hate it if anything were to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sued 200 spammers on behalf of Internet providers and has never lost a case . He hates spammers , but he also believes they pose a real threat to the Internet . " Left unchecked , spam would kill e-mail , " he says . " They are all Internet criminals . " <p> Fight goes to courts <p> Increasingly , Internet companies are taking their battle against spam to the courtroom . In June , Microsoft filed 15 lawsuits claiming spammers flooded its systems and customers with more than 2 billion deceptive messages . AOL has won more than 25 cases against spammers . <p> The effectiveness of the litigation is debatable . There are so many spammers , it is impossible for the industry to sue more than a few of them . Also , when they sue , Internet providers often worry about protecting only their own subscribers . <p> In 2001 , Verizon sued one of the most prolific spammers  --  a Michigan man who blasts more than a billion e-mails a year . To settle the case , the spammer agreed to leave Verizon subscribers alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spam others . <p> By contrast , EarthLink 's lawsuits seek to prohibit spammers from sending e-mail altogether . <p> Wellborn relies on laws prohibiting computer fraud and trespass . Courts repeatedly have agreed that the transmission of unsolicited commercial e-mail  --  even pitches from real companies with real products  --  is tantamount to trespassing on the networks of Internet providers . " The courts have been real clear that a ' no spamming ' rule represents a virtual ' no trespassing ' sign to the world , " Wellborn says . <p> That point often is lost on the public and lawmakers , Wellborn says , because Internet providers typically pursue cases where fraud has occurred . <p> " I would like to see more cases not only against the spammers who are committing identity theft or credit card fraud , but against the ' legitimate ' spammers , " Wellborn says . <p> Like a collect call <p> Wellborn 's version of spammer hell  --  yes , he has one  --  has three rings : the red-hot bottom for the outright crooks , the scorching middle for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is still plenty hot for everyone else . <p> He scoffs at spammers ' argument that they have a free speech right to pitch their products on the Internet . " I do n't think anyone believes the Constitution gives an unfettered right to send penis enlargement ads , Viagra ads and bestiality ads at the cost of the recipient , " he says . " Spam is like getting a collect call that you have to accept . " <p> With Wellborn at their table , EarthLink has racked up more than $40 million in judgments against spammers . In May , the company was awarded $16.4 million against Howard Carmack , aka the Buffalo Spammer , who sent 825 million spam messages on e-mail accounts opened with 343 allegedly stolen identities . <p> With EarthLink 's help , New York 's attorney general has indicted Carmack on criminal charges . " I am always extremely pleased , enthusiastic , about sharing information , " Wellborn says . <p> Hefty civil judgments often do n't amount to much , because most spammers do n't have assets , legal experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . EarthLink says it has not collected a dime from its judgments . <p> But , for Internet companies , the lawsuits are n't about recovering money , Wellborn says . They are about setting examples for all spammers and forcing some to stop . " When someone like Carmack is taken out , that is 825 million fewer e-mails Internet service providers have to pay for , " he says . <p> For Wellborn , as for Rush , fighting spam is a mission . <p> " I could make a whole , whole lot more money focusing on other aspects of the law , " Wellborn says . " When I am working on a case against a spammer , I am wearing a white hat . . . . That is how I will leave my mark on this world .
