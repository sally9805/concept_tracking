Headnote Years of experience as an illustrator helped Pennsylvania artist Denny Bond develop a range of techniques for using liquid watercolors . Those procedures allow him to build layers of clean , transparent color as he balances the composition of shapes , edges , and values . by M. Stephen Doherty Although commercial illustrators are familiar with the various types of liquid watercolor sold in bottles with caps that dispense the intense colors in drops , most fine artists have little experience with the products . That 's not surprising since the watery paints are marketed specifically for airbrushing , tinting photographs , and painting illustrations ; and artists were once cautioned against using them because they used to be made with fugitive dyes that quickly faded . All that has changed , and Denny Bond is one of many artists taking advantage of the brilliant , lightfast colors now available . It 's in the nature of illustration that assignments have to be done quickly and in a way that makes it easy for artists to adjust their paintings when clients want something changed . Traditional watercolor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint will crack when it dries on the palette , it has to be heavily diluted to use with an airbrush , and the colors are generally not brilliant enough to quickly render the appearance of metal , fabric , and wood surfaces . On the other hand , liquid watercolor can always be reactivated from a dry to a wet state , it tends to remain transparent and intense , and it is ready to be used with an airbrush when a uniform , photographic , or stenciled look is needed in a painting . Bond developed his skills of building up layers of liquid watercolors when he first established a career creating industrial , advertising , and editorial illustrations for various companies ; and he continues to use the same techniques to create fine-art paintings as well as illustrations . " I think there are two qualities in my fine-art paintings that are influenced by my illustrations , " he explains . " One is that I am inclined to tell some kind of story in my watercolors , no matter how personal and indecipherable that story might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paintings in which I incorporate my own image . In one I hold a mask away from my face ( this painting is actually one 1 did of my son ) ; and in three others I am either nude covering my face with my hands or I am lying back with my hands behind my neck . " The other aspect that seems to unify my paintings is that I work hard at composing images so they engage the viewer , " Bond continues . " The center of interest is never in the dead center of the paper , the shapes and values clearly identify that center of interest , and the repetition of colors and shapes brings attention to all areas of the painting . " My process usually begins with rinsing both sides of a sheet of Arches i4O-lb or 3oo-lb cold-pressed watercolor paper and stapling it to a gray board , " Bond explains . " Once the paper is dry , I apply ' ' ' of clear tape to guarantee adhesion and provide a clean border of white around the painted image . 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my photographs , and I mask out the central image so I can paint the background first . I am not sure how or why I got in the habit of painting the background first , but it works well for me . The painting shown in the demonstration was one of the few wherein I actually completed the background before working on the face . I knew that in this particular painting I needed to complete the background to assure the central subject . I start most of my paintings with the main subject matter . " All my watercolors are layered , layered some more , and then layered again , " says Bond . " There is a vast difference between layering and overworking . I use this technique to achieve subtle color changes or to develop large areas of a solid background . With Dr. Ph . Martin 's Hydrus Fine Art watercolors , I can brush lighter colors over darker ones without color movement , as I do n't scrub the surface of the paper . I move fast so the layers going on top do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors underneath . It 's not a technique for the faint of heart . " Despite the fact that I use masking fluid , I prefer not to have sharp edges in my paintings , so I usually paint the darker areas and then soften the transitions to the middle-and light-value areas by applying a wet brush to the edges so they bleed and soften , " Bond explains . " I can also soften an edge by applying a slightly wet brush to it and feathering the transition between the two values , or by reapplying a color on top of the same dried color and dragging a damp brush over the edges . Another technique is to lightly scrub the transitions with a stiff brush after dipping it in water . " Like most painters , I struggle to get past the midpoint of the painting process when everything seems doomed to fail , " Bond confesses . " Most artists know what it 's like to reach a point when you want to tear up a painting , but you remind yourself you 've been able to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick it out a little longer . Fortunately , when you come back to a painting after tossing it aside , the path to completion becomes more obvious . " Bond points out that he faced just such a turning point when working on Equilibrium , a portrait of his wife . " The dark cast shadows looked great in the photograph I was using as a reference , but halfway through completing the painting those dark shapes looked terrible , and I considered whether or not I should start over , " the artist remembers . " I held off making any drastic changes until I had painted in the blue wall , balanced that color against the blue in my wife 's blouse , and added the dark frame around the picture on the wall . I then softened the edges of the cast shadow , and the composition seemed to come together more effectively than I imagined during my moment of panic . In fact , all the dark tones helped bring a glow to the face and hair in the portrait . " Bond says he usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three days after completing it . " Sometimes I decide to add another layer of paint , as I did in the portrait of my wife , " he says . " With the watercolor paper still adhered to the board , it was easy to make the adjustments without the extra water causing the paper to buckle .

For example , I have done a series of paintings in which I incorporate my own image .
