Chapter One : TRACY Tracy Barnett glanced at her watch . The jailbird was already a half hour late . Big surprise . His first day on the job , his chance to get started right , and he did n't bother to show up on time . She set her hand inside a wire cage , and a huge Norway rat waddled up her arm and onto her shoulder . She shivered when his cold nose nuzzled her neck . Then she felt his teeth scrape against her skin . " Cut it out , Jose , " she said . He was after the gold clasp on her necklace again . She eased her fingers under his fat body and lifted him into the air . Reaching up with her other hand , she scratched the rat 's cheeks until his mouth opened and the necklace came free . She set him back in his cage , then unfastened her necklace and stuck it in the pocket of her jeans . Jose . What kind of name was that for a Norway rat ? But at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( that is , if you put up the money for the animal 's food ) , you could name it anything you wanted . Well , almost anything . Millie , the Center director , had refused to let a boy name a guinea pig Snothead . But they had a Dribblepuss . And a hamster named Sir Wetzalot . And a rat , Mr. Vinson , named after the middle school principal . Tracy decided that they should name an animal Kevinafter the jailbird . But they did n't have a skunk or a weasel . And all the snakes were too nice . Luke , Tracy 's older brother , rapped on the door of the Animal Room . He put his face up to the glass and shouted , " Is Mort loose ? " Rain was beating down on the roof , but Tracy had forgotten how loud it was until Luke had to yell over it . Tracy pointed toward the corner . " Up there . " Mort was a screech owl they had rescued from the roadside the summer before . His broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could n't be released into the wild . When things were quiet , Tracy let him fly around the roomalthough he really did n't fly . He fluttered and hopped from one perch to another . Luke pushed the door open a few inches and eased into the room . Tall and thin , always smiling , he got along with everybodyexcept Tracy . He grinned at her and asked , " You still mad ? " Tracy picked up Jose and set him on her shoulder . " Me ? Mad ? Just because my clod of a brother called me a whiny old bag ? " " I did not . I said you better watch out or you 'll grow up to be a whiny old bag . " Tracy stepped back and held up her hands . " Oh , that makes me feel so much better . " " I need a feather for the microscope exhibit , " Luke said . " That 's not all you need . " Tracy began sweeping wood shavings into a cardboard box . " Get one out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . " " You 're not supposed to clean those cages . " " Funny thing , " Tracy said , dipping a rag into the bucket of bleach solution . " These cages do n't clean themselves . And we 're having a little trouble getting the animals potty trained . " " You know what I mean , " Luke said . " Kevin 's supposed to do those . " " Yeah . And Kevin was supposed to be here a half hour ago too . " " He 'll be here . It 's part of the contract he signed . " " Yeah , yeah , I know the drill . If he does n't show up , he gets put back in juvie hall . So he 'll drag in about noon with some lame excuse . He knows how to work the system . " Luke reached into the owl 's cage and picked up two tiny feathers . " He may have had trouble getting a ride . " " What 's the problem ? " Tracy said . " He can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Save him some work to do . He needs to learn how to do things . " He held the feathers up to the light . " These 'll work . " Tracy snorted . " Operation Start Overthat has to be the dumbest idea I ever heard of . " " What 's the problem ? You 've been whining for months about needing help . So now you have some . " " Yeah , just what we needa dumb jailbird who does n't even like animals . " " He 's not dumb , " Luke said . " And you do n't have to be a rocket scientist to clean cages . " " Watch it , " Tracy said . Luke reached for the doorknob . " I know it 's never happened in your whole life , but you might turn out to be wrong about him . " " Right , " Tracy said . " But do n't leave your car keys sitting around , okay ? " Luke smiled and shook his head . " You heard what Millie saidthink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right . And we 'll change his whole life . And when he gets to be President of the United States , he 'll say , ' I owe everything to Operation Start Over and those wonderful people at the Jefferson Science Center . ' " Luke looked up at the owl , then pulled open the door . " Great attitude , Sis . " Then he was gone . Tracy sighed . Luke was rightin a way . The Science Center , part of the town 's museum group , was always short of money and help . Student volunteers like Luke and Tracy kept the place going , but most volunteers did n't last long . After a few sessions of cleaning cages , they drifted away . The Center especially needed help during the winter months . Having somebody like Kevin show up every Saturday would have been greatif he had n't been a jailbird with a rotten attitude . After Tracy cleaned four cages , she slipped a leather glove on her right hand and reached out to Mort . She nudged the owl 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His talons tightened on her finger . She carried him to the side window and leaned against the sill while she stroked his head . The rain was coming down in sheets . It had been doing that for the past ten days . Just a few miles north of there , the river was out of its banks and people 's houses were underwater . And even in this town , which was built on high ground , lots of streets were flooded . The Center 's parking lot was under several inches of water . With this weather , there would n't be many visitors today . That was fine with Tracy . She liked the Center better when it was closed . Luke loved to set up new displays and put on shows . Tracy just liked the animals . And the quiet . Things were simple here . The animals did n't ask for much . Food , warmth , a little attention . They did n't care what you looked like or whether you wore the right clothes or said the right things . And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your back . Up until now , whenever she was sick of her school and all the stupid things there , she could escape here to the Center . Just her and the animals . But now things had changed . Kevin Marsh , as part of Operation Start Over , would be doing his public service work here . When he came by last Saturday , she thought he might be all right . He was n't bad-looking , and he had a great smilewhen he smiled . Best of all , unlike ninety-eight percent of the boys in the freshman class , he was taller than she was . Not by much . But he was taller . He was friendly at first , especially after he found out she was Luke 's sister . But when she tried to show him around , he acted like she was from some other planet : " Hey , give me a break . I do n't care about that stuffwho started the place and all that . I 'm slave labor . Just tell me what I 'm supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you want to look around ? " she asked him . He shook his head . " I 've seen enough . This is better than juvie hall , and that 's my other choice . " He looked at her and laughed . " So lucky youyou get me for a helper . " " I must be living right , " she said . " Do n't blame me , " he told her . " This is the judge 's bright idea . " And Luke thought Tracy had an attitude problem . At school on Monday , Kevin had come up to her in the main hallway and put his arm around her and said , " Hey , Tracy , how 's every little thing ? " He was n't being friendly . He was trying to embarrass her . And he 'd done a good job of it . Fifty people around , and the way he yelled , all fifty ended up looking right at her . She 'd stepped back to get away , and he 'd laughed and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier question next time . " Then he 'd laughed again and yelled out , " See you Saturday . We 'll have some wild , crazy times down at the Jefferson Center . " Tracy shook her head . That 's the way things went for her . Her friend Melissa was always talking about the perfect start for the dayto have a good-looking guy come up , put his arm around you , and whisper something gooshy in your ear . So when it finally happened to Tracy , she got a loudmouthed jailbird making fun of her . Well , maybe he would n't show up . That was second best . The best was for him to get caught stealing another car and end up in jail and out of her life . Tracy heard car doors slam . She looked out to see Mrs. Wisecarver and her brats coming up the sidewalk , wearing yellow slickers and carrying umbrellas . The Center was n't open yet , but Millie would let them in . Mrs. Wisecarver was always good for a donation , and Millie did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the time Tracy put Mort back in his cage , the Wisecarver kids were banging on the Animal Room Door and yelling , " Little pig , little pig , let me come in . " It was almost ten when Tracy spotted Kevin stomping through the puddles in the driveway . His wet hair was hanging in his face , and water was pouring off the denim jacket he always woreprobably the first time it had ever been washed . " Here comes the jailbird , " Tracy called to Luke . " I told you he 'd come , " Luke said . " An hour and a half late , and I 'll bet he does n't even say he 's sorry . " " Lighten up , " Luke said . " Give the poor guy a chance . " " You work with him then . If you can think of something simple enough for him to do . I 've already done most of his work . " " I told you to leave it . " " We 'll start getting visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Kevin pulled open the front door and walked through . His shoes made a squishing sound with each step . " Hi , Kevin , " Luke called out . Kevin raised his hand a few inches and headed for the rest room , leaving a trail of water on the floor . " Nice of you to stop by , " Tracy said . " If there 's anything we can do to make your visit more pleasant , be sure and let us know . " " Shut up , " Luke whispered . " He can hear you . " " Oh , that 'd be too bad . We would n't want to hurt his feelings . " Luke shook his head . " You 're practicing to be an old bag again . " " Oh , fine . Mr. Humanity . As long as you 're all full of love and understanding , why do n't you go mop the floor where he slopped it up ? "                @ @ @ @ @
