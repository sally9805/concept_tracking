Over the past four years no team has played baseball 's back nine better than the New York Yankees , the only club to play .600 ball or better after the All-Star break in each of those seasons . Their captain , shortstop Derek Jeter , did not hesitate to reveal the formula for such second-half success . " You have to have good pitching , " he said last Friday before the Yankees , playing to form , opened another second act by sweeping a three-game series from the Chicago White Sox . " If you rely on offense , it 's going to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find a way to win even when you do n't hit . " As Jeter spoke in the New York clubhouse , the Yankees ' latest hope for second-half pitching reinforcement was on his way there from the airport : an overweight , recovering alcoholic righthander who had been dumped by two clubs in the last 10 months and owned a 5.88 ERA since the start of the 2004 season . Sidney Ponson , formerly of the Baltimore Orioles and most recently the St. Louis Cardinals , declared himself happy to be back in the American League , in part because " pitchers do n't have to run the bases . " // Fitness aside , Ponson 's glorified tryout in the New York rotation -- he replaced last July 's potluck pickup , righthander Shawn Chacon -- stood as a prime example of the strange , even desperate days of this second half . Thanks to the wild-card format and revenue sharing , pennant races are no longer exclusively for the elite . A record-tying 19 teams stood within five games of a playoff spot at the All-Star break , matching the total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the same thing , " says Toronto Blue Jays general manger J.P . Ricciardi , referring to a picked-over pitching market , " and there 's nothing out there . " // Only the New York Mets , with a 12-game lead in the NL East at week 's end , and the AL Central -- leading Detroit Tigers , the 12th team ever to start a 162-game schedule 62 -- 30 or better , looked like locks to be playing in October . So muddled was the rest of the playoff picture that two teams with losing records entering the first weekend of the second half , the Los Angeles Angels and the Colorado Rockies , still bore the look of second-half success stories waiting to happen . In addition to playing in forgiving divisions , the Angels and the Rockies were fortified by solid pitching , productive farm systems ( which enable them to explore what limited trade possibilities do exist ) and every-day lineups stocked with players in or entering their prime -- all essential elements for second-half success . Says one AL executive , " The Angels are the one team that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces for a huge second half . Their pitching is scary good , and if they add one bat , look out . " // Meanwhile , San Francisco Giants G.M. Brian Sabean identified last-place Colorado , which has been to the playoffs only once in its 14-year history , in 1995 , as the most formidable challenger in the tightly packed NL West . And even as a bullpen collapse contributed to a seven-game losing streak last week , Rockies G.M. Dan O'Dowd was n't inclined to disagree . " I think we 're the team in the division that has the best chance to get better , " he said . " We have n't come near our ceiling yet . The only thing we do n't have is experience . We 're still learning how to win at this level . " // If the first half of a season offers hope to the mediocre , the second half demands excellence . From 2001 through last season 30 teams played .600 ball or better after the All-Star break , including seven of the past eight World Series teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher winning percentage in the second half ( .070 higher on average ) . Here , starting with Jeter 's prerequisite , is what it will take for such a second-half surge . // Pitching , Pitching , Pitching // Of those 30 teams that were hot after the All-Star break , 21 finished among the top four in ERA in their respective leagues . That means the Milwaukee Brewers ( 16th in the NL through Sunday ) , Philadelphia Phillies ( 12th ) , Cincinnati Reds ( 11th ) , Blue Jays ( 10th in the AL ) and Texas Rangers ( eighth ) appeared to be underfortified for a .600 run in the second half , despite their relative proximity to a playoff spot at the break . On the other hand , the Angels ( second in the AL ) and the Rockies ( third in the NL ) were contenders on more solid footing . Los Angeles boasted the league 's best rotation this side of the scorching Tigers , with Bartolo Colon pitching well since returning from the disabled list , John Lackey ranking second in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a .194 batting average , Ervin Santana ( 11 -- 3 ) flourishing in his first full season in a big league rotation and Jered Weaver becoming the first rookie to win his first six starts since the Dodgers ' Kaz Ishii in 2002. // " Toronto will be better in the second half if A.J. Burnett makes all his starts , " Yankees G.M. Brian Cashman says of the righthander who recently came off a two-month stay on the DL . " But if the Angels play like they 're supposed to -- and they will if they keep getting that kind of pitching -- I 'm sure they 'll be there in the end . " // For the first time in his seven years as Colorado G.M. , O'Dowd was not searching for starting pitching . His rotation 's 4.32 ERA was nearly a full run better than the franchise record ( 5.19 , in 1995 ) , and the quartet of Jason Jennings , Aaron Cook , Jeff Francis and Josh Fogg had yet to miss a start . O'Dowd , however , was looking for an experienced relief pitcher to revive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orioles , Roberto Hernandez of the Pittsburgh Pirates and Elmer Dessens of the Kansas City Royals . // Those pedestrian arms are n't likely to create a ripple throughout the division . So scarce is available pitching , however , that Cincinnati last week traded two productive every-day players , outfielder Austin Kearns and shortstop Felipe Lopez , to Washington to essentially obtain two setup men , Gary Majewski and Bill Bray . Unless the Phillies put Tom Gordon on the market , relievers traded this July may be as underwhelming as the batch moved a year ago , when Kyle Farnsworth , Ron Villone , Kevin Gryboski , Jay Witasick and Chad Bradford were dealt . // Impact Trades // San Francisco manager Felipe Alou says the NL West " is going to be determined by trades . Some team that comes up with a big one might turn the tide . " The big ones , though , have become increasingly rare . The biggest names to change teams last July , for instance , were B-listers Chacon ( from Colorado to the Yankees ) , Farnsworth ( Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco ) and Preston Wilson ( Colorado to Washington ) . // Any club that thinks it can bolster its playoff rotation through a trade can just about forget it . Over the last three seasons only two pitchers were traded in July and made a postseason start that year : Chacon last season and Ponson for the 2003 Giants . That track record should not encourage the Mets , who have looked at Dontrelle Willis of Florida , Barry Zito of Oakland and Javier Vazquez and Freddy Garcia of the White Sox , all of whom were deemed off-limits . Chicago manager Ozzie Guillen quashed rumors of talks between the White Sox and the Mets by saying that his team is not trading a starting pitcher to get bullpen help . The best starter traded this year may turn out to be Livan Hernandez of Washington or Rodrigo Lopez of Baltimore , who had ERAs of 5.87 and 6.44 , respectively . // Second-half races are more likely to swing on the return of injured starters such as Brandon Backe of the Houston Astros ( expected back this month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Mark Mulder of the Cardinals ( perhaps mid-August ) and Rich Harden of the Oakland A 's ( late August ) . // Teams searching for a bat , such as the Angels , figure to have a more satisfying shopping experience . Bobby Abreu , Pat Burrell and David Dellucci of Philadelphia and Alfonso Soriano and Jose Guillen of Washington were among the best hitters who could be moved . Though Baltimore shortstop Miguel Tejada would seem to be the hitter prospect-rich L.A. covets , a source familiar with Orioles trade talks says Baltimore owner Peter Angelos has insisted since last winter on getting proven major league talent in return for Tejada -- and even then he killed off-season talks with the Chicago Cubs ( involving starter Mark Prior ) , the Astros ( closer Brad Lidge ) and the Minnesota Twins ( centerfielder Torii Hunter ) . // Houston , which struck midseason gold in deals for lefty Randy Johnson in 1998 and outfielder Carlos Beltran in 2004 , made its move during the All-Star break by trading two prospects to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for infielder-outfielder Aubrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player in the second half ( box , above ) . Huff responded with a game-breaking three-run homer in his first game for the Astros . " I ca n't imagine that playing in Tampa Bay , you can get too fired up , " Houston first baseman Lance Berkman says . " Not being in contention can wear on a guy mentally , and I think having a change of scenery , where he feels he can contribute , will give him something to play for . He may turn out to be the steal of the trading season . " // Position Players in Their Primes // The White Sox , Boston Red Sox and Florida Marlins won the past three World Series without a single RBI from a player older than 34 . Those teams , as well as the 2002 champion Angels , relied almost entirely on position players between 24 and 32 years old . Of the five best career second-half hitters among active players ( minimum 1,000 at bats through Sunday ) , according to Stats Inc. , all were 32 or younger : Todd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Cardinals ( .340 ) , Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners ( .326 ) , Jeter ( .322 ) and Vladimir Guerrero of the Angels ( .321 ) . // The premium on young legs may be even higher this second half , when the dog days will be played for the first time under a ban on amphetamines and harsher penalties for using performance-enhancing drugs . " Have I seen guys dragging at times this year and wondered , Hmmm , is that because of the ban ? Yes , " Yankees righthander Mike Mussina says . " But I have n't seen a real noticeable difference on the field . You would think it would show up in the second half , but who knows ? There 's no way to measure it . " // Says one NL G.M. , " You 'll notice the difference in August and September , when guys really start to drag and their bats get slow . " // Particularly vulnerable to a slowdown could be the Padres and the Reds ( both of whom have four position players 34 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lineup includes four players 39 and older : shortstop Omar Vizquel and outfielders Barry Bonds , Steve Finley and Moises Alou . San Francisco 's old-timers figure to be tested by a grueling end-of-season schedule . Of their final 31 games , the Giants play 19 on the road , all but three in the Eastern or Central time zones . The Angels ' roster , by contrast , includes only five players older than 32 , one of whom ( 34-year-old Garret Anderson ) is a regular . All of the Rockies are 32 and younger except relievers Jose Mesa , 40 , and Tom Martin , 36. // The Rockies ? NL West favorites ? The idea seems as implausible as Jamey Carroll , a 32-year-old utilityman purchased from the Nationals in February , having a breakout season ( .322 ) and becoming Colorado 's catalyst . The Rockies have n't finished fewer than 15 games out of first place since 1997. // " I 'm blessed to be here because I know I could have been fired three or four times , " says O'Dowd . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right direction . And we have a group in Double A that is going to merge with this one and hopefully become an outstanding team down the road . Right now we 're going to have fun and see what happens . If we can stay within five or six games , it 's going to get real interesting .
