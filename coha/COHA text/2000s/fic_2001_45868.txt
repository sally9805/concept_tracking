Mr. Shockley traveled to Romania in 1999 , where he was able to view the total eclipse from the roof top of the Continental Hotel in Timisoara . He says he passed this tale as a passage a car ride through Rumania during a rainstorm . We hope it 's not autobiographical . <p> THERE HAD BEEN A LOT OF traffic at first , but now our car was the only one on the road . We 'd left Timisoara in the late morning , after a viewing of the last total eclipse of 1999 . Unfortunately , a cloud had obscured the sun at the key moment . Silviu claimed he 'd seen a glimpse of the diamond ring , as the flaring feature on the eclipsed sun is called . I had not noticed it myself , but had been impressed by the dramatic darkening of the sky , the sudden clamor of bewildered birds , and the coolness that for a few minutes replaced the stifling heat of the last days . Now , several hours later , we were most of the way across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I were on our way back to Venice , where we would return to our small villa on the Lido . Our friends would go on to their apartment in Milan , and Silviu would return to the university . For days , the heat had been relentless , and the sky a clear blue up to the day of the eclipse . But today , a weather system had moved in and the sky was white . The traffic , which had clogged the narrow two-lane roads and slowed our progress , had diminished with the oncoming rain , light at first , then heavy and relentless . Now we were the only car on what passed for the main road to Budapest . We had entered the region of Transylvania . Dark , gray-white mists clung to the mountains and crept down toward the road in thick tendrils , like the tentacles of an enormous ectoplasmic octopus . Silviu , who was driving , was growing alarmed at the conditions . He was muttering to himself , peering through the windshield through the rivulets of water that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt with gestures that I took to be surreptitious signs of the cross . I knew Silviu as a modem man , a scientist , a member of the Romanian Academy of Sciences . Yet something in him seemed to be moved , atavistically , perhaps , by our lonely journey through these mountains of evil omen . My wife Helene , sitting beside Silviu and me in the front seat , seemed abstracted and was nervously chewing on her lower lip . Our Italian friends , Giulio and Gina , in the back , had been laughing and chatting , and munching biscuits which they had purchased at the last AGIP station . But presently , as the rain increased and the sky darkened with the approach of evening , even these light-hearted creatures fell silent . Torrents of water cascaded down , forming small lakes on the road which our car passed over and through with a hiss . Here and there , the low stone retaining walls on the mountainside had given way , and our car passed over an ever-increasing accumulation of twigs , pebbles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A deserted car park had become a lake , empty except for one white plastic chair floating in it . Thunder came down with a crack . The skies lighted momentarily with lightning . And then the catastrophe we had all been expecting happened . We rounded a bend and Silviu brought the car to a quick stop . Ahead of us , a pile of rocks and tree limbs had come down the mountainside , blocking the road completely . Rocks were still falling , tumbling down the steep slope in a steady stream . There would be no getting to Budapest by tonight . " What now ? " I asked . Silviu said , " There was a turnoff a hundred yards or so back . Do you remember seeing it ? " I nodded . " It slanted up the mountain , as I recall . " " Yes , I think so . But it was macadamized . I think it might go in parallel with this road . " " Worth a try , " I said . " If it looks bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all in agreement . We backed up cautiously to the turnoff . It seemed safe enough , so we turned up the mountain at not too steep an angle . THE ROAD WAS good for a while , but in half a mile the macadam ended and we were on a dirt track . The surface was beginning to wash out . Any time now we were likely to get trapped . The car was sliding from one side to the other . There was some danger of going over the edge , down a steep hillside to our destruction . Silviu kept the car barely at a crawl , his hands tense on the wheel . Conversation had stopped . The Italians in the back seat were silent , Giulio , the young engineer , and Gina , his fashionable wife , gripping each other 's hands , their faces tight and concerned . Beside me in the front seat , Helene 's face , lighted by flashes of lightning , was pale and drawn . It looked as though we would have to stop and spend the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of - half a liter of mineral water , and a few not very good Rumanian cookies we had picked up at the last gas stop . There was n't enough room in the car for all of us to lie down . We would have to spend the night sitting up . Not the worst of disasters , but something to be avoided all the same . I was remembering tales I had heard of these Transylvanian mountains . Giulio , in the back seat , as though echoing my thoughts , wondered aloud how far we were from the castle of Vlad the Impaler . Gina laughed , a little shakily . " That 's no more than a tourist attraction nowadays . " We all laughed . But it became obvious that Silviu did n't find this sort of talk amusing . He said , " It is true that Vlad is only a legend now . But strange things still go on in this region . They do n't come to the attention of the world outside Rumania . They 're barely noted in Bucharest , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common wisdom is , inexplicable things still happen around here . It is a region best avoided . Especially on nights like this . " It was full dark now , the blackness of the mountainside contrasting eerily with the white mist . We were just deciding to stop . The going was simply too treacherous , with a precipice on the right and the steep , heavily wooded mountain on the left . But there was no place to turn out . We wondered , should we continue , looking for a place to pull off the road ? Or just stop where we were ? It was unlikely any other vehicle would be traveling this road on a night like this . Still , it called for a decision , and meanwhile Silviu kept the car barely creeping along , trying to make out the edges of the road through the streams of water pouring down the windshield . Suddenly I saw a flashing light up ahead . Silviu saw it at the same time , and slowed the car still more , until it began to buck in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , while the others crowded forward to see . " I have no idea , " Silviu said . " But we might as well find out . " He slowed slightly again , because the car was now slipping and sliding badly on the dirt track . " Gear up , " Giulio advised , and Silviu shifted up to second , getting slightly better traction . At last we came up to the light.and saw that it was a man , dressed in a long rain slicker and waving a flashlight . We stopped and Silviu wound the window down . There followed a brief conversation in what I took to be Rumanian . At the end of it , Silviu groaned and pounded the steering wheel with his fist . The man said , in English , " I was telling your friend that this road leads nowhere . It comes to an end in another two miles . And it is unsafe even in good weather . Did n't you see the warning sign ? " " It must have washed out , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead another twenty yards , " the man said . " There is a road to the left up into the mountain . Dirt , but passable . I have my lodge there . I suggest you spend the night with me . " " A lodge ? Here at the end of nowhere ? " " Only a few rooms are completed , " the man said . " When it is all done , and the road hardened , my hotel will have the finest view in these mountains . Not that you can see much of it now . " " Your lodge is a hotel ? " " It will be . The finest in the region . But in the meantime , even in its present state , it is a better place for you than out here in the weather . If you agree , I will lead you to my drive . " It seemed the best option . Silviu followed the man , crawling along in low gear to a turnoff twenty yards ahead . Then we climbed again up a high  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrestling with the wheel to keep us out of the runoff ditches on either side . At last the road leveled out into a broad clearing , and at the end of it was a partially finished structure . Flashes of lightning revealed a small hotel constructed in what I took to be an old Rumanian style with elaborate carvings . The lower floor was lighted , and our host stood in front of the doorway , waving us in with his flashlight . We came inside , soaked by even that short an exposure to the rain . Our host had towels at hand to dry ourselves off . He was of average height , broad but not portly , balding , and with a round , cheerful face . He introduced himself . " I am loan Florin . Welcome to my hotel . It is still incomplete , as I told you , but I can offer you beds for the night , and dinner , if you are not too choosy . " We thanked Florin . I asked him , " How did you know we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , " Florin said . " But I was looking out over the landscape from one of the upper windows and saw your headlights coming up from the road below . Since I know this road leads nowhere except to here , and I am not yet officially opened for business , I deduced you were travelers in need of assistance , and acted accordingly . " Florin prepared a dinner for us - a tasty goulash soup that reminded us we were not far from the Hungarian border . This , with chunks of bread and a local white wine , and finishing with a dish resembling apple strudel , satisfied our hunger , which had grown intense during the hours on the road . Afterward , before retiring , Florin invited us into his parlor , a large , cheerful room that took up most of the finished portion of the downstairs . Here , with small glasses of the local plum brandy , we settled back and unwound from our ordeal . Florin proved to be a good conversationalist as well as an excellent host . Born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked for some years in Budapest in an uncle 's hotel business . He spoke Hungarian and German as well as Rumanian and English , and was a treasure trove of local folklore . Our talk turned inevitably to stories of old Transylvania - of the horrifying Vlad the Impaler , whose castle was not far from here , of Elizabeth Bathory and her penchant for taking rejuvenating baths in the blood of young servant maids , and others , less well known but equally unsavory . From there we moved on to vampires , succubi , and other unclean creatures of the night . Silviu did n't like this line of talk . " These legends , " he said , " are part of the old folklore of this area . And the world is entranced with them still . But their main use is to entertain adults and frighten children . Nowadays we know that there is no such thing as supernatural phenomena , and that one part of this Earth is , psychically speaking , very like another . " " I agree with our friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no doubt correct , and to believe otherwise is worse than superstition - it is indefensible self-indulgence . Yet some in Calinesti - the village nearest to us - believe that nature herself , in her blind construction , is guided by spirits who take a hand from time to time in the affairs of men - and then we have brief upheavals of what appears to be the supernatural , the unnatural , the uncanny . " " You appear to be an educated man , " Silviu said . " Surely you do n't believe this peasant nonsense ? " Florin shrugged . " I believe situations come about as if there were a supernatural . You are familiar with Vaihinger 's thesis ? " Silviu shrugged . " German philosophers can also be guilty of superstition under the guise of scientific discourse . " " Perhaps . But however it comes about , it is common knowledge that certain places have a shape , a contour , a positioning of elements that is not merely suggestive of evil , but is evil itself . Such a notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chesterton , if I am not mistaken . " " As a literary conceit , " Silviu said . " But an interesting one . It is the idea that the shapes and arrangemeens of things can carry a meaning . Like an artist 's grouping of elements in a landscape . Nature herself is arguably the greatest of artists . Who is to say that her creations do n't sometimes have a purpose , an intention , a meaning greater than chance arrangement ? " " The notion has a certain charm , " Silviu admitted . " But scientifically , it is complete nonsense . " Florin smiled and shook his head . " It is only a supposition , of course . But might we take it as correct , just for the sake of argument ? " " I suppose you can take anything as correct , " Silviu said somewhat grumpily , but raised no further objection . " Excellent . And would you object if we add the concept that , though physical beings , we live in the midst of an invisible spiritual world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " Silviu said . " I only mean that all our influences are not apparent to our unaided senses . I cite the unease most people get just before an earthquake . This can not be measured by science yet , or even truly ascertained . But it undoubtedly has a physical basis . In the sense I 'm using the word , atoms are spiritual . We know of their existence only through rather sophisticated inference . " " Put that way , I suppose I can accept your supposition , " Silviu said . " My point is that things exist which , though impalpable , unsusceptible to the testimony of our senses , are nevertheless capable of exerting an influence over us . " " What you 're stating is mere common sense , " Silviu said . " Yes . Thank you . So we have a world of influences which we do not know about directly . This I call spiritual . From this , we can conjecture that what happens in a man 's life at any given time will depend to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual world he passes through , an invisible world through which he swims like a fish in water . " Silviu pursed his lips and looked grave , but could find no objection to the statement . Florin went on . " It is this world that gives our physical world its nature and tone . What happens here in our world of everyday reality is influenced to a great extent by what is happening there in that world of unseen spiritual entities . An atom , I maintain , is one such entity . A ghost or an evil influence could be another . " Helene spoke up for the first time . " Is it so certain that anything is happening there ? Might n't this spiritual world , if it exists at all , be all of a piece , like an ocean or a fog bank ? " Florin smiled and shrugged . " It could be any way we please to imagine it . But in my view , the spiritual world is larger and more various than our world , and more mysterious . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their existence , but there is no reason to think we have come to the end of what is there to discover . " Silviu nodded . He was uncomfortable with this line of reasoning , but he was n't going to argue that all discoveries had been made . " In my view , " Florin said , " this spiritual realm is a complete world in its own right , a realm with a psychic climate that has its equivalents of storms and sunny days , and much else besides . If you 'll grant me this , perhaps you 'll also grant that this realm can produce freak weather conditions from time to time . " " A novel notion , " Silviu said , " but it seems to follow from your premise . " " Therefore it follows that what we do n't see , but is there nonetheless , influences us though we are n't aware of it . Now we come to the shapes of things and their influence on our lives . " " About time we got to the spooky stuff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A certain landscape , thrown up perhaps by chance elements , could provide a nexus , a focus , for certain spiritual beings - creatures that probably have an objective existence in their own realm , but are as ghosts or spirits in ours . The configuration of a countryside , the shape of a castle , and the momentary spiritual climate that forms up around them might have been instrumental in bringing forth a Vlad the Impaler , or , at another time , an Elizabeth Bathory . " " If that were the case , " Silviu said , " why are n't we drowned in the horrors of the invisible world like the Dark Ages thought we were ? " " I think the Dark Ages exaggerated the situation . In my formulation , these eruptions of the so-called supernatural are both exceptional and transitory . They are elements thrown up for a brief time by the chance combination of landscape and spiritual entity . They persevere for a few days or years , then dissolve again into the matter-of-factness of our daily lives . In one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen miles away , in another spiritual microclimate , there might be nothing exceptional . Afew miles further on , in yet another spiritual microclimate , we might find a spate of evil sprites in the form of bats , living only for a day , perhaps , but doing damage to whoever was so unfortunate as to encounter them . " " It 's a lovely idea , " Giulio said . I noticed he was a little drunk . " If we could figure this stuff out , we could run guided tours of haunted places . Come to Vlad 's castle and meet Dracula ! Appearing for three days only due to favorable weather conditions . " It could be a scheduled event , like our recent eclipse ! " " I do n't think it 's a funny idea at all , " Gina said . " My grandmother was from Salerno and she had similar notions . I was always afraid of that old woman . " " Your mother must have inherited it from her , " Giulio said . " I wonder what chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . " " Do n't you dare say anything against my mother ! " Gina said , laughing and throwing a cushion at him . The talk broke up at that point by mutual consent . Silviu had had enough of the argument . He seemed to feel that science had been turned into superstition , though he could n't quite figure out how it had come about . But he was tired and perhaps not thinking too well . We all were tired . Our host , noticing the slackening of our interest , showed us to our rooms . Helene and I went up to the little room that had been assigned to us , and while unpacking we fell into one of those quarrels that seem to arise for no reason , and to continue despite the best efforts of both parties to bring them to an end . At last we fell into an uneasy silence . Helene was sitting in front of the little dresser brushing her hair , looking back at me in the mirror , when she said , " You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do what ? " " Rub the side of your mouth in that way . You 've only just begun it , and I 'm sure it 's meant to tease , but I find it quite sinister . " " I was n't aware that I was doing anything . " She stared at me for a moment , then turned back to the mirror , continuing to brush her hair with long , even strokes . MY MOOD , which had been equable all evening despite our situation , took a downward turn . I hung up my clothes and paced aimlessly around the room for a while . I was wondering what had possessed me to undertake this trip in the first place . What had seemed a light-hearted lark only a day ago now felt like the stupidest thing in the world , and a source of deep irritation . I wondered why I had ever agreed to travel with Giulio and Gina , newlyweds who could n't stop touching each other , and Silviu , precise , didactic , humorless . Even Helene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unapproachable . Now , just to make matters worse , she spoke up again . " Charles , I 've asked you this before , please do n't creep up on me like that . " I choked back a harsh reply , turned on my heel and walked through the little gallery down to the adjoining bathroom . Despite it being almost midnight , I decided to shave , and thus steal a march on the next day . It was an old-fashioned bathroom , with a basin with two taps , a bathtub on clawed feet , and a shower attachment running from the faucet with a valve to direct the flow . The room itself was of plain pine , with a layer of white paint that covered it none too well . At the base of the tub , almost at the adjoining wall , the final wooden board had been cut too short , and there was a kind of gap in the wall , an opening less than a foot square . Reaching in and fumbling around , I found a space , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so it seemed to me , to hold something . I found myself staring at it , and then I straightened and looked at my straight razor , which I had removed from its small leather case . I was turning the razor so that the light of the hanging kerosene lamp played across its edge , and all the time I was thinking to myself , " I know a trick worth two of that , " though I had no idea where I had heard it or what I meant by it . I looked out the small window . The darkness was almost complete , but the dirty white mist floated on it in long streamers , as though it were reaching out and trying to grasp something . I watched for a while , then sighed and returned to my shaving . When I was done , I put my razor back in its case and returned to our room . Helene had finished brushing her hair and was now removing her makeup with cold cream . She looked pale and not very attractive , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found myself looking at her and thinking , " A face like that could kill a man in his sleep and think nothing of it . But I know a trick worth two of that . " It seemed to me the punch line of some story , but to save my life I could n't remember where it came from . Perhaps it would come to me later . I had a dream that night . In it , a horrid presentiment gripped me , and I ran down the hall to Giulio 's and Gina 's room . They were both dead . Someone had severed their heads . Or perhaps they had done it themselves . But how , in that case , had the heads changed position , his lying near her body and hers paired with his ? In my dream I put the question to Giulio , and his head smiled at me and said , " Listen , it 's not what you think . " " Perhaps not , " I replied , " but in any event I know a trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day we were on our way again . The sky had cleared and the rain had stopped . The sun was up and it promised to be another hot day . We came down to the main road without difficulty . When we reached the blockage that had stopped us last night , we found that a team of peasants were clearing the landslide , and a policeman was directing traffic around the remaining debris . We were on our way to Budapest , and Italy after that . Our moods had lifted considerably . We did n't even talk about last night . Except for Silviu , who said , " That innkeeper , Florin , was a strange fellow with his far-fetched theories . But harmless , I think . Probably just trying to keep us amused . " I nodded , but I was thinking along quite different lines . Florin the innkeeper with his talk of Vaihinger and Chesterton and his theory of the ever-changing invisible world of spirits - what fools he must have taken us for ! How he must have enjoyed the malice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his warm sitting room , drinking plum brandy , warming to its glow as he thought about how his vile insinuations would fester in us , releasing their poisons , spreading their insidious rot , like spores growing and festering in the dark places of our minds , until , months or years later , when we had forgotten their source , they would bear fruit and burst , and one day I would senselessly strangle Helene in her sleep , or , if the suggestion worked in her first , she would poison me during an apparently eventless evening over dinner , between the soup and the appetizer . Helene was not going to get me , however . Back in our villa on the Lido , before the spiritual poison had a chance to make her dangerous , action could be taken that would make her death seem natural . As for Silviu , Giulio and Gina , they would have to take their chances . I would make it a point never to see them again . Just to be on the safe side . But as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contagion - I had my own plans for him . Oh yes , my friend , I thought . Enjoy yourself in your snug sitting room , chucking over the catastrophes that will befall those who come your way . But soon I 'll return - to retrieve my shaving case , and my straight razor , which I so carefully hid in the little space between the bath tub and the wall - and then I 'll show you I know a trick worth two of that .
