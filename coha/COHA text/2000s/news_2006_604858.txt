<p> LONDON  --  When an international furor erupted over cartoons depicting Islam 's holiest figure , no one was more surprised than Mohamed Farah . <p> Born in Somalia , raised in Denmark and now living in London , the 21-year-old student was one of many Muslims outraged by cartoons that mocked the prophet Mohammed . And he was shocked to learn the cartoons were first published by a Danish newspaper  --  the one he delivered as a boy . <p> " The Scandinavians are a peaceful people , " says a mystified Farah , who wears a New York Yankees jacket even when he visits the London Central Mosque . " Freedom to speak is good , " he adds . " But to insult Mohammed is bad . " <p> Over the past two weeks the cartoons have sparked scores of protests from Morocco to the Philippines . At least 10 people have been killed . <p> In several countries , crowds have attacked the embassies of Denmark and other European nations . The Danish government has withdrawn diplomats from Indonesia , Iran and Syria . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Middle East . Danish cheese has been burned in protest . <p> This week , as the furor continues , people around the world share Mohamed Farah 's bewilderment : over the decision to publish the cartoons , or the response they evoked , or both . <p> Although billed by some as a " clash between civilizations "  --  a sort of cold war between fundamentalist Muslims and the secular , democratic West  --  the cartoon controversy was really about the clashes within two civilizations : Western Europe and global Islam . <p> The cartoons ' publication was not merely an academic exercise in freedom of speech , but something that reflects underlying tensions racking Europe . Those include Muslim immigration and assimilation , and fear of terrorism  --  especially after the bombings in Madrid in 2004 and London last year . <p> " It 's not a conflict of civilizations , " says John Esposito , a Georgetown University professor who wrote What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam . " It 's a conflict within Europe . " <p> And within the Muslim world , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spontaneous cry from the heart , but one manipulated by various Muslim political and religious leaders to advance their agendas by targeting Israel , democracy and rival strains of Islam . <p> Esposito says the cartoons allow autocrats in Muslim nations such as Syria and Iran to say to their genuinely outraged people , " See what democracy means ? " ' Muslims , both secular and devout , have enormous love for the prophet ' <p> Even today , few of the world 's 1.5 billion Muslims  --  including protesters  --  have seen the images at the center of the controversy . <p> The affair began last year , when a Danish author working on a children 's book on the Quran and the life of Mohammed was unable to find an illustrator . Artists said they feared the wrath of Muslims if they drew images of Mohammed . <p> Upon learning this , the culture editor of Jyllands-Posten , Denmark 's largest circulation daily , invited cartoonists to submit entries . The editor , Carsten Juste , published 12 drawings on Sept. 30 , saying he wanted to challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a turban shaped like a bomb . <p> Another had him telling suicide bombers arriving in heaven that he 'd run out of virgins with which to reward them . <p> The cartoons aroused Muslim protests  --  5,000 demonstrated in Copenhagen  --  but little international reaction . <p> Triggered by three events <p> Then , three things happened : <p> *On Oct. 21 , the Danish prime minister refused to meet with ambassadors from Muslim nations to discuss the issue , saying the government had no control over , or responsibility for , the newspaper . <p> *In December , Danish Muslims visited several Middle Eastern nations , including Egypt , Syria and Lebanon , to ask for Muslim support . They showed not only the 12 cartoons , but other images allegedly demeaning to Muslims that were not published . The word spread via satellite TV , the Internet and text messaging . <p> *On Jan. 10 , a Christian newspaper in Norway reprinted the cartoons in what it described as a show of support for press freedom . <p> By the end of the month , protests had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jyllands-Posten apologized Jan. 30 for causing any offense . <p> Meanwhile , news media outlets in more than a dozen other European countries reprinted some or all of the cartoons . Few U.S. media outlets ran any of the cartoons ; a notable exception , The Philadelphia Inquirer , said it was important for readers to understand both sides of the story . <p> The incident followed similar clashes in recent years over a French policy of banning Muslim girls from wearing traditional head coverings in school ; the murder by Muslim radicals of a Dutch filmmaker who had criticized Muslim treatment of women ; and reports , never verified , that U.S. military interrogators at Guantanamo threw a copy of the Quran , the Muslim holy book , in a toilet . <p> Whatever caused the controversy , most students of Islam and Muslim society agree that more friction is likely . <p> " You have the Western tradition of freedom of expression and you have Muslim religious sensitivities , " says Akbar Ahmed , professor of international relations at American University in Washington . " It 's the irresistible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosion ? Experts identified existing conditions that contributed : <p> Muslim immigrants in Europe <p> John Keiger , director of the European Studies Research Institute at the University of Salford in Manchester , England , says many Europeans feel confronted at home by " a Muslim culture that not only is foreign , but which does not want to be integrated . " <p> He says right-wing political parties trade on that worry , at a time when nations in the European Union are struggling with their own identities and values . <p> Muslims also are afraid , Keiger adds : " They are increasingly being portrayed as violent , as ones who only have violent solutions . " <p> Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen 's center-right government has remained in power partly because of a popular crackdown on immigration . <p> At the same time , immigration opponents have accused a leading Danish imam , Ahmed Abu Laban , of stoking outrage over the cartoons by spreading anti-Danish propaganda when he went to the Middle East . <p> Some Muslims accused Europeans of a double standard on freedom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish Holocaust ? " asks Mushtaq Yossef , 29 , a Baghdad mobile-phone salesman . " Of course not . " <p> Marco Incerti , a research fellow at the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels , argues that some European newspapers printed the cartoons to show they wo n't succumb to Muslim intimidation  --  saying , in effect , " We like to do things a certain way , and we 're going to blow it in your face . " <p> Politicians had their own goals <p> The protests served different ends in different places , according to Ahmed , the American University professor . <p> In Afghanistan and Pakistan , they were organized by opponents of U.S.-backed governments . In Syria and Iran , they could not have happened without government approval , as Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Sunday on the ABC television program This Week . " Iran and Syria bring protesters into the streets when they wish , to make a point , " she said . <p> Mohsen Rezaie , a top official in Iran 's hard-line government , was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though none was published there . <p> " Do you know of any place that does n't have Zionists ? " Rezaie asked in an interview in Tehran with USA TODAY . " We think this confrontation between Muslims and Christians is a premeditated attack by Zionists . " He said the aim was to turn the Christian world against Muslims and build European support against Iran and its nuclear program . <p> Struggle over Islam 's future <p> The cartoons clearly struck at something sacred . " Muslims , both secular and devout , have enormous love for the prophet , " Ahmed says . " They go berserk when he 's attacked . " <p> Even so , one of the protesters ' central contentions  --  that the image of the prophet should never be depicted  --  is challenged by many scholars of Islam , including John Woods , a University of Chicago historian . They say such a strict interpretation is not mandated by the Quran or by Mohammed 's sayings . Instead , it is a prohibition asserted by modern-day fundamentalists favoring a rigid Islamic doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LibForAll Foundation , a non-profit advocacy group based in Winston-Salem , N.C. , that supports moderate Islam , especially in Indonesia . He says controversies like the one over the cartoons are opportunities for radicals to try to hijack the religion . <p> " Something we 're doing will always offend ( fundamentalist Muslims ' ) sensibilities , " he says . " Islamic radicals will always find something that causes an emotional charge . And they will jump on it . " Can anything be done to resolve and to limit future culture clashes ? <p> If many Muslims are outraged by what many Westerners consider free speech , what can be done to resolve and limit these disputes when they arise ? <p> Ahmed says leaders must act quickly when they see a crisis developing to cross the cultural and linguistic chasm . The United States " can score points simply by saying to Muslims , ' We understand your feelings . We do n't approve , either . ' " <p> However shocking the images and rhetoric unleashed by the controversy , violent protest was the exception , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consider Jakarta , capital of Indonesia , the world 's most populous Muslim country . Residents said that they were offended by the caricatures , but opposed to violence . <p> Only 14 demonstrators showed up for a protest organized by a student group outside the presidential palace Wednesday . " Most of our members could n't come because they did n't want to miss classes , " explains organizer Muhammad , 22 , who like many Indonesians uses one name . <p> The next day another protest drew less than 50 people . <p> Asked about the cartoons , Rizan Chandra , 46 , a marketing director in Jakarta , says , " I do n't give a damn . The caricature wo n't be able to discredit the prophet . ... Actually , the violence done by Muslims around the world is also quite stupid and will only worsen the perception of Islam . " <p> On the other side of the world , Shazad Shah , a 28-year-old Pakistani studying highway engineering in London , says he was n't that mad , because the prophet Mohammed " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take that away . ... " <p> Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi bemoans the " huge chasm that has emerged between the West and Islam . " It is , he says , largely because of Muslim frustrations at Western policies on Iraq , Afghanistan and the Palestinians . <p> Westerners " think Osama bin Laden speaks for the religion and its followers . Islam and Muslims are linked to all that is negative and backward , " he adds . <p> The impact of the blowup is unclear . Ahmed , of American University , and Zahid Bukhari , director of Georgetown 's American-Muslim Studies program , outline two scenarios that could emerge from the crisis . <p> Westerners could become more aware of what angers Muslims , and thus less provocative ; Muslims could become more aware that freedom of speech is a praiseworthy Western tradition , not a weapon against Islam . <p> But it 's also possible , they say , that Westerners  --  outraged by having seen their flags shredded , embassies burned and leaders hung in effigy  --  will become more determined to confront @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could become even more sensitive . <p> Joseph Braude , a Middle Eastern analyst and magazine columnist , says he feared a third possibility : " Legitimate expression ( in the West ) will be stifled for fear of provoking another response like this . " <p> Nearly every Muslim outside the United States interviewed by USA TODAY favored some controls on speech , especially when the subject is religion . As Shah , the Pakistani studying in London , puts it : " Freedom is good . But not too much freedom ... " <p> Stinson reported from London , Hampson from New York .
