<p> On February 1 , Rome was treated to a brilliant spectacle when the Colosseum  --  a place where ancient Romans came to watch condemned men fight to the death  --  was bathed in golden light . The United Nations , the city of Rome and the Vatican have converted the Colosseum into a symbol for a worldwide campaign to abolish the death penalty . Now it is illuminated for 48 hours whenever someone  --  anywhere in the world  --  is spared from execution . On this occasion , the Colosseum was lit to celebrate Illinois Gov . George Ryan 's moratorium on the death penalty . <p> While the Illinois moratorium is indeed a bright spot in the recent U.S. history with the death penalty , the Colosseum lights were extinguished throughout most of January as 12 executions were carried out in the United States . The darkest hours of all occurred during the executions of three young men who committed their crimes when they were younger than 18 . <p> America 's continued practice of executing juvenile offenders has alarming implications for our society 's visions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law and indeed childhood itself . When we execute juvenile offenders , we ignore what we know  --  and what science continues to teach us  --  about the many ways in which children and adolescents are different from adults . We ignore long-established principles of law holding that punishment should be commensurate not simply with the criminal act , but with the intent , culpability and mitigating factors pertaining to the individual offender . We ignore what the American Society for Adolescent Psychiatry tells us : Adolescents who " commit capital crimes very often suffer from serious psychological and family disturbances which exacerbate their already existing vulnerabilities . " <p> Moreover , executing juvenile offenders is a barbaric and atavistic practice that makes the United States  --  long a champion of human rights  --  a pariah nation in the eyes of the world . It exposes us as hypocrites with respect to both our foreign and domestic policy . How , for example , can we impose economic sanctions against human rights violators abroad when we are violating international law and the human rights of children at home ? How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legally preventing them  --  because of their immaturity  --  from entering contracts , making medical decisions , joining the military , voting , smoking , drinking alcohol or even gaining admission to an " R " rated movie ? <p> JUVENILE OFFENDERS ON DEATH ROW <p> The Commonwealth of Virginia rang in the new millennium by executing Douglas Christopher Thomas on January 10 and Steven Roach just three days later . Texas , which has executed eight juvenile offenders since 1973 and currently has 28 youthful offenders on death row , executed Glenn McGinnis on January 25 . These executions were carried out notwithstanding appeals from numerous organizations , including the European Union and the American Bar Association . Even Pope John Paul II sent a plea to Gov . George W. Bush asking that he commute McGinnis ' sentence to life in prison . <p> About 73 other juvenile offenders are awaiting execution on death rows throughout the United States . More than two-thirds of them are minorities . Fifty-one percent are black , 18 percent are Latino and 31 percent are white . All are male . <p> Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows . Out of the 38 death penalty states , 19 execute 16- and 17-year-olds and four execute those 17 and older . In 1988 , the U.S. Supreme Court held that executing children under the age of 16 violated the Eighth Amendment 's ban against " cruel and unusual punishment " because it is contrary to " evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society . " <p> If not for this decision , some states would be executing even younger offenders . Former Gov . Pete Wilson , the architect of California 's recently passed Proposition 21 , has floated the idea that the age for the death penalty should be lowered to 14 . In the wake of the Jonesboro , Ark. , school shooting two years ago , Texas legislator Jim Pitts proposed lowering the age to 11 . <p> CHILDREN ARE DIFFERENT <p> America 's unforgiving attitude toward youth in the justice system is a stunning indication of just how far our country has tumbled from its leadership role in treating troubled children . More than a century ago , America led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in trouble with the law by creating the world 's first juvenile court . <p> Outraged by the treatment of children in adult prisons and jails and following the lessons of the nascent human sciences , reformers created a system and laws that recognized that children and adolescents were different than adults . Policymakers recognized that childhood , especially adolescence , was a transitional period of life where cognitive abilities , judgment , impulse control , identity and emotions are still being developed . They recognized that the malleability of youth makes juvenile offenders inherently capable of rehabilitation . <p> In creating juvenile courts , Americans also understood the basic truth that adolescents are simply less culpable than adults for their misdeeds . Adults are presumed to be fully formed moral actors capable of understanding right from wrong , of choosing between the two and conforming their actions to the requirements of the law . However , because children and adolescents are still maturing and do not possess the same capacities , judgment and controls , and because they are often traumatized and abused , we have not generally punished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed the same act . <p> The last two decades , however , have witnessed enormous changes in the way our justice system treats offenders , first in the adult system and more recently , in the juvenile justice system . As a result of punitive measures such as " three strikes " laws , " sexual predator " laws , the abolishment of parole and mandatory prison sentences , currently more than 2 million Americans are behind bars . The adult system is now focused on punishing and incapacitating offenders and has all but given up on trying to rehabilitate them . <p> In the last decade , these " get tough " measures have also come to drive juvenile justice policy , destroying much of the historical differences between the two systems and placing the juvenile court 's rehabilitative ethos in jeopardy . Between 1992 and 1997 , 47 states passed laws making it easier to try children as adults . <p> SUPERPREDATOR MYTH <p> What spurred these changes ? The late 1980s and early 1990s did see an alarming increase in the number of juveniles charged with murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban areas , adult gang leaders and drug dealers recruited and armed youngsters in their battle to control the lucrative drug trade . This spike in homicide arrests was almost exclusively confined to the inner cities and virtually all of the increase was gun-related . <p> This increased violence among urban teens was cause for concern but did not justify the wholesale demonization of America 's youth that soon followed . Beginning in late 1995 , Princeton professor John DiIulio coined the word " superpredator " to describe a new breed of " remorseless and morally impoverished " juveniles who would soon flood America 's streets as projected increases in the youth population came to pass . Politicians seized on this rhetoric , inflamed the public 's fear and exploited the gap between public perception and the reality of juvenile crime . Increased press coverage of juvenile violence , making it seem like the norm rather than an aberration , also fanned public hysteria . <p> The truth is that less than one-half of 1 percent of America 's kids were arrested for a violent crime last year . And even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime during a time when the overall population of youth has grown  --  trends that completely discredit the superpredator myth  --  juvenile crime remains a hot-button political issue today . California 's Proposition 21 is the most recent example of this trend and signals that there may be no end in sight . <p> The effect of these changes has altered the landscape of juvenile justice . Twenty-three states now have no bottom age limit for kids to be tried as adults . Last year , Nathaniel Abraham , a Michigan boy who was only 11 at the time he was charged with murder , became the youngest boy in modern American history to be prosecuted as an adult . According to Amnesty International , Nathaniel was just one of more than 200,000 youngsters under the age of 18 who were prosecuted in our adult courts last year . <p> Perhaps the most disturbing result of these changes , however , is the increase in the number of children housed in adult prisons . Just this month , the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that the number of youths under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than doubled , rising from 3,400 in 1985 to 7,400 in 1997 . More than a quarter of these youths in adult prisons are between the ages of 13 and 16 . <p> The dismantling of the juvenile justice system demonstrates that attention and focus have shifted away from the individual child 's needs , problems , strengths , developmental stage , potential and culpability . Now the focus simply is on the seriousness of the crime and meting out punishment . We no longer care who or how old the offender is , what his intent was , why he is in trouble , who he may yet become , or what extenuating factors may have contributed to the act . <p> This singular obsession for retribution is also what drives the decision to execute juvenile offenders . Thus , notwithstanding the fact that Chris Thomas was an extremely troubled adolescent who suffered from depression and abused substances , Virginia Gov . Jim Gilmore focused only on the need to " demand complete accountability " when denying Thomas ' final plea for clemency . Similarly , the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 9 and was later beaten with a baseball bat and burned with hot grease by his mother and stepfather fell on Gov . Bush 's deaf ears . Rather , Bush insisted on sending " a strong message that the consequences of violent criminal behavior will be swift and sure . . . " The fact that Thomas and McGinnis were only 17 at the time of their crimes has become irrelevant . <p> U.S. SHUNS INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS <p> America 's changing visions of punishment and childhood  --  most dramatically illustrated by this practice of executing juvenile offenders  --  are increasingly out of step with international standards of decency and established international law . All but the United States and the collapsed state of Somalia have ratified the 10-year-old U.N . Convention on the Rights of the Child , which forbids the death penalty against youths under 18 . Similarly , the International Cove-nant on Civil and Political Rights , which has more than 144 signatory countries , also bans the execution of those who commit crimes under the age of 18 . Deferring to the rights of its individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore the covenant 's ban on executing juveniles . <p> Over the last decade , only six other countries are known to have executed juvenile offenders  --  Yemen , China , Iran , Nigeria , Pakistan and Saudi Arabia . China and Yemen have recently outlawed the practice . In the 1990s , Amnesty International documented 19 cases of child offenders who were executed . Ten were executed in the United States alone  --  more than all the remaining countries combined . In this fundamental area of human rights , the United States has gone from a leader to an outlaw . <p> What will it take to get the 23 remaining states to stop executing minors ? Appealing to the hearts and minds of legislators and governors does n't seem to work in an age where playing upon fears and getting " tough on crime " have big political payoffs and mercy is seen as a sign of weakness rather than a strength . Such efforts failed to stop the executions of children and the mentally retarded in the past and likely will not prevail in the future . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change is to borrow a page from the U.S. playbook when it comes to human rights violators  --  exert economic pressure and sanctions . Domestic and international corporations might want to reconsider relocating to or investing in states that execute youthful offenders . Investors and consumers might add this factor into their decisionmaking . Indeed , an organized economic boycott in South Carolina is forcing that state to seriously reconsider flying the Confederate flag at its state capitol . Similar boycotts by the National Football League and other businesses helped move the Arizona citizenry into recognizing Martin Luther King Jr . ' s birthday as a holiday . <p> Already the 15 countries of the European Union , all of whom have abolished the death penalty under all circumstances , have begun to exert both diplomatic and economic pressure . In July 1998 , in a letter to Gov . Bush of Texas , the chairman of the European Parliament 's Delegation for Relations warned that many European companies , under pressure from their shareholders , were considering restricting their investments in states that have the death penalty . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has final authority over the European Union 's budget , controls billions of dollars in foreign investment . European investment in Texas , for example , supports 184,500 jobs , 39 percent of which are high-paying manufacturing jobs . Of the $67.5 billion invested in the Texas economy from around the world , 56 percent  --  or $38.1 billion  --  comes from Europe . Europe is also Texas ' No. 2 export market , with $8.8 billion worth of goods bought in 1996 . <p> The Europeans mean business . If anything , they are likely to increase the pressure through both diplomatic and economic channels . Just last month , French President Jacques Chirac , French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and former French Minister of Culture Jack Lang became actively involved in trying to halt the execution of Odel Barnes , an adult offender in Texas . Lang visited Barnes and took his case to the world press while Chirac reportedly took the unusual step of calling former President Bush , urging him to assert his influence on his son . Although these efforts to save Barnes ' life failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause and suggest that they are n't going to go away quietly . <p> In the new global economy , where economic interdependence is critical , the United States and its individual states will need to compete more aggressively for investment and trade from both domestic and international sources . This reliance could give consumers , investors , corporations and foreign governments greater leverage in influencing human rights policies within the United States . We can think of no better place to start exercising this economic muscle than in persuading the states to cease executing juvenile offenders . <p> The great Russian novelist and philosopher , Fyodor Dostoevsky , once wrote that a society should be " judged not by how it treats its outstanding citizens but by how it treats its criminals . " We believe that an even better barometer of a nation 's soul is how it treats its most troubled children . In executing juvenile offenders , America has fallen from grace . <p> By stopping this shameful practice , America can take a significant stride toward once again establishing itself as a beacon for the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Until that happens , we 'll have to look to the Colosseum for our hope and inspiration . <p> DEATH PENALTY WEB SITES <p> For more information on the death penalty , go to : <p>  --  ABA Juvenile Justice System at **48;98;TOOLONG <p>  --  Victor L.
