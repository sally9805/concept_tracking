Chapter One The four-year-old wrapped an arm around his father 's leg . " Daddy , " he said , tugging at the pocket of his father 's sports coat , " why do people come to the simmy-terry ? " The day was as gray as Max Sheridan 's mood , and Nate 's questions did nothing to improve it . He looked into the innocent , brown eyes and smiled despite himself . Oh , but he loved this kid ! " To visit loved ones , Nate . To pay our respects to people who have died . " Nate knelt in the damp grass . One by one , he placed the white roses he 'd chosen at the flower mart at the feet of the marble angel guarding his mother 's grave . " Mommy is n't in there . " He spoke with conviction . " Only her bones . Her soul is in heaven with God . " He stood and pressed close to his father . " Right , Dad ? " Max inhaled deeply . " Yes , Nate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy to sleep ; how different was this white lie ? He 'd tried believing in God , in miracles . Well , if God truly existed and He could perform miracles , he and Nate would n't be here at Melissa 's grave , now would they ? For a long time , Nate merely stared at the tombstone . " She is n't cold , you know .... " Nate had been too young when Melissa died to have any real memory of her . He seemed to have no recollection of those bleak days in the funeral parlor , when friends and relatives speculated about why a beautiful woman with so much to live for would take her own life . If there had been a God to thank for that , Max would have prayed himself hoarse . Max had only brought Nate to Peaceful Gardens twice , and each visit inspired new curiosities - and childlike observations about death , dying and the afterlife - in his son . " ... because the tempa-chure in heaven is always a pleasant seventy-five degrees . " Nate 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered that tidbit of information . Max chuckled . He was something else , this kid of his . " Where 'd you hear that ? " " Gramma Georgia tol ' me so , on the phone yesterday when I tol ' her we were coming here to say goodbye to Mommy . She said Mommy will always be warm and happy , ' cause everything is perfect up in heaven . " If God did n't exist , then neither did heaven . But Max smiled . He saw no point in tarnishing the boy 's image of ... things . Even Max did n't understand why , when in all other areas he 'd been a no-nonsense , tell-it-like-it-is parent . Fairy tales were stories , nothing more . Santa and the Easter Bunny were invented to put money into the pockets of the greeting card manufacturers . The tooth fairy ? The lazy parents ' way of coaxing their kids to brush and floss . Far better to extinguish his son 's belief in fantasies like that than to let him grow up and find out how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , he was less rigid when it came to matters of religion , spirituality and faith . If Nate wanted to attend Sunday school with his school chums , fine . If he wanted to tag along when the neighbors attended services , so be it . Nate got so much out of the whole " church thing " that Max could n't bring himself to put an end to it . Something , though , told him that the longer he waited to teach the boy the truth as he saw it , the more difficult it would be . " Is Gramma full of beans ? " Laughing , Max took Nate 's hand . Where did the kid come up with this stuff ? " ' Course not , son . " Nate 's face crinkled with confusion . " But , Dad , you said so yourself , just last night , ' member ? " Yes , he remembered , only too well . He 'd been on the phone with his mother , discussing the trip to Amarillo , when she started with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " nonsense . Max 's day had been bad enough to that point ; being forced to listen to her spiritual malarkey was the proverbial straw on the camel 's already overloaded back . " If your precious Lord is so merciful , " he 'd demanded , " why 'd He allow Melissa to take her own life ? Why 'd He let you - a woman who devoted her whole life to Him - break your leg ? " " I did n't raise you to talk like that ! " Georgia had scolded . And when she started praying for his salvation , he 'd put a hand over the phone and closed his eyes . " Mom , " he 'd muttered , " you 're full of beans . " And that 's when he 'd noticed Nate , standing in the doorway . " I was only teasing , " Max had whispered past the phone 's mouthpiece . " Besides , Gramma did n't hear me . " But Nate 's doubting expression said he believed otherwise . Now , Nate stood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeans . " You gon na say goodbye to Mommy , Dad ? " Closing his eyes , Max held his breath and summoned the strength to go through the motions ... for Nate . He 'd tried to say goodbye to Melissa , for even as the EMTs struggled to save her , they 'd known she was dying . Instead , he 'd struggled to keep a lid on his temper . Max could n't remember being more angry with her . He had n't understood why she left Nate then , and he did n't understand it now ... nearly three years later . The very people who , when he was a boy , taught him that suicide was one of the most grievous sins a human could commit , also believed that God in His heaven had total control over things on earth , that He loved every last person . If that was true , why did some of His " children " die of starvation , while others became victims of genocide and war ? Why did good people get cancer , while bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their simple faith seemed to bring them such joy , such solace . Nate - more than any of them , Max believed - deserved to grow up feeling that way . At least until life stepped in and taught him otherwise in its usual fist-to-jaw way . " You gon na say a prayer for Mommy ? " Prayer . Of all the - Groaning inwardly , Max shaded his eyes . " Tell you what , " he said from behind his hand , " why do n't you say the prayer this time . " " Me ? " Nate 's brown eyes widened . " Thanks , Dad ! I 'll do a good job . I promise . " He got down on his knees and bowed his head , then he closed his eyes and pressed both palms together , fingers pointing skyward . " God ? It 's me , Nathan Maxwell Sheridan . Um , me an ' my dad wo n't be comin ' to visit my mom here at the simmy-terry for a while , on accounta my gramma busted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Max corrected gently . He did n't see much sense in correcting the " for a while " part . " ... on accounta Gramma broke her leg , an ' we 're going to Texas to take care of her ' til she can walk again . So , God ? Could You do me a favor ? I know my mom 's soul is up there in heaven with You , so maybe You could tell her not to worry ' bout her bones an ' her wedding ring an ' stuff while we 're gone , ' cause the men who work here take real good care of the place . Thanks . " ( Continues ... )
