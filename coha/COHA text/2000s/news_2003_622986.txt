<p> From the Saudi Arabian mainland , a four-lane causeway snakes out across the shimmering waters of the Persian Gulf , on and on into a hazy horizon . <p> Sixteen miles later , you are in another world  --  the island kingdom of Bahrain . <p> The harsh conservatism that marks Saudi society is palpably absent here . Instead , there are women driving cars and striding confidently down the street in Western clothes . There are bars , movies , outdoor advertising . There 's a certain nip of freedom in the air  --  and the expectation of more to come . <p> Bahrain is a tiny laboratory of liberalization in the Persian Gulf region . Since 1999 , when King Hamad Al Khalifa took the throne after his father died , he has repealed many of his country 's most repressive laws and allowed a moderate dose of democracy . Bahrain 's people , the majority of whom are long-suppressed and previously riotous Shiites , are relatively calm despite the presence of the huge U.S. Navy base that is a cornerstone of the Iraq war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the country can be called fully democratic , but the results offer hope that Bahrain 's neighbors can undergo rapid change without violent upheaval . <p> BELLWETHER FOR THE REGION <p> For the Bush administration , the tentative steps toward greater freedom being taken here and in the neighboring states of Qatar and Oman are a sign that democracy could be brought to a postwar Iraq without chaos . <p> And for reformers in Saudi Arabia  --  including , perhaps , the monarchy itself  --  Bahrain is a test case indicating that Saudi reform should be allowed to proceed unhindered . <p> " King Hamad 's process of reforms have taken Bahrain a long way in only three years , " said Sheikh Ali Al-Salman , a Shiite religious leader who is chairman of the Al-Wefaq National Islamic Society , the largest opposition party . " We support them , although we believe them to be incomplete . " <p> In municipal elections last year , Al-Wefaq won control of 22 of the nation 's 50 cities . The party mainly represents Bahrain 's Shiite Muslims , who make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is Sunni Muslim , an imbalance that for many years caused protests by the Shiites . The monarchy ran the country with an iron fist through the 1980s and into the ' 90s , imprisoning hundreds of people and killing about 40 dissidents . <p> In the 1980s , many of Bahrain 's Shiites  --  and many of the Shiite minority in eastern Saudi Arabia  --  sympathized with the hard-line ayatollahs of neighboring Iran . A spate of civil disturbances and bombings of banks continued through the mid-1990s . <p> The atmosphere changed markedly after King Hamad took over in 1999 , following the death of his father , Emir Isa Al Khalifa . Hamad loosened restrictions , freed all political prisoners and allowed exiles to return . Elections were allowed for municipal posts and the Chamber of Deputies , Parliament 's lower house . However , the members of the Upper House are appointed by the king , and the king and his ministers are the final authority . <p> OPPOSITION RELAXES <p> Sensing the trend toward accommodation , the Shiites have moderated their political and social views . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no clash between our view of Islam and democracy , elections and the woman 's right to share in politics , " Al-Salman said . <p> Bahrain 's capital , Manama , is home to about two-thirds of the nation 's population . It is a compact city of high-rises and pleasant , well-landscaped boulevards , with an orderly atmosphere left over from the days of British colonial rule , which ended in 1971 . <p> The population is mostly non-Bahraini  --  including Westerners who run the large banks that serve the entire gulf region , plus a polyglot of Pakistanis , Bangladeshis , Filipinos and other Asians who do just about everything else except government work . <p> The strategic importance of Bahrain lies in the sprawling naval base that is home to the U.S. Navy 's Fifth Fleet , which patrols the Persian Gulf and will be the backbone of any American-led invasion of Iraq . <p> In recent months , there have been some street demonstrations against the U.S. presence that drew several thousand people each time . But the protests were strictly Bahraini style : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out of hand . <p> But in a sign that a tiny radical minority does exist , authorities last week arrested five Bahraini men on charges of plotting terrorist acts . Officials said that the target was local Americans and that two of those arrested were from the Bahraini military . <p> These were the first terrorism-related arrests made in Bahrain since the Sept. 11 attacks . <p> There are a handful of Bahrainis among the hundreds of suspected al Qaeda fighters at the U.S. base in Guantanamo , Cuba , who were captured during the U.S.-led military campaign in Afghanistan . <p> " These problems are very rare , and really do n't represent the changes that are happening in Bahrain , " said Ebrahim Bashmi , editor in chief of the Bahrain Tribune and Al-Ayam , jointly owned newspapers published in English and Arabic , respectively . <p> OLD AND NEW <p> In fact , many Bahrainis mix the traditional and the new with surprising verve . <p> Take , for example , the scene one night earlier this month in the desert 20 miles south of Manama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded by tents  --  an age-old Bahraini tradition , especially during holidays . But it also could have been a Berkeley backyard barbecue . <p> Eighteen-year-old Amne Bisan was holding forth by the fireside . " Of course I 'm a feminist . Like , here you have to be , " she said in a lightly accented English that she said she had learned from watching satellite television . <p> " I mean , who wants that Ninja turtle look ? " she said , referring to the hijab , or black cloak that covers all but a woman 's eyes . It used to be the norm in Bahrain and still is mandatory in Saudi Arabia . <p> Bisan and her friends in a huddle around her were indistinguishable from any Bay Area high school seniors , with jeans and jacket , and speaking with jerky , forceful hand gestures that were halfway between geeky and sophisticated . <p> The girls were completely conversant with U.S. culture , comparing recent demonstrations by Americans against the war in Iraq with the Bahrainis ' more modest efforts . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and because we were women , I had to convince the guys in the march just to let us be there , " Bisan said , her hands flapping exasperatedly . " You know , this is still Bahrain . " <p> DEMOCRATIC MONARCHY <p> Men and women of all ages entered the fireside debate , including Bisan 's father , Jaffer Hassan , a high school teacher and newspaper columnist . He wore the half-embarrassed , half-proud expression typical of any father with a precocious daughter . He corrected her only once , when she suggested that a monarchy might be a fundamentally anti-democratic system of government  --  still a taboo idea in Bahrain . <p> " We all hope the king never wakes up in a bad mood one day and decides he does n't like reform anymore , " said another member of the crowd , Rahman Al-Noaimi . <p> All Bahrainis remember the island 's first experiment with democracy two decades ago  --  Bahrain elected its first parliament in 1973 , but just two years later , the emir disbanded it after lawmakers attempted to abolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Al-Noaimi is chairman of the National Democratic Action Society , a left-of-center secular party that has much influence among Bahrain 's professional class . " The king was and still is more liberal than many of his subjects , " he said , noting that in November 's elections for the 40-member Chamber of Deputies , none of the four female candidates had won seats . <p> Around the gulf region and internationally , many observers say the Bahrain experiment is a bellwether for the region . " Bahrain is what Iraq could look like five years from now , " said one Western diplomat in the region . <p> Saudi Arabia , which has long had problems controlling its restless Shiite minority , has heavy economic and diplomatic influence over the Bahraini government . Some observers say they see a hidden hand behind the Bahraini reforms . <p> " The Saudis allowed the Bahrain changes to take place as an experiment , " said Fareed Mohamedi , a Bahraini who is chief economist of Petroleum Finance Co. , a Washington consulting firm . " It 's a laboratory for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform Saudi Arabia . He 'll adapt what is happening here , because it 's a very different country . <p> " But the result will be a trade-off to mollify his people  --  in exchange for economic reforms that could be painful , he 'll give them political reforms .
