WHITJOHNSON , 28 : " OUR DRUG IS MOUNTAIN BIKING . WE GO ON A RIDE . RELEASE ALL OUR STRESS , SMILE THEN COME BACK AND DO IT AGAIN THE NEXT DAY . " // STRENGTH-AND FOLLY . THAT 'S YOUR 205 . It was in his 20s that Lance Armstrong became the second-youngest world road champion ever ... and also ignored pain in his right testicle-pain that was the cancer that nearly killed him . We are invincible . And clueless . For most of us , our 20s are a decade of squandered potential . Our sheer ability to perform athletic-ally peaks in our mid 20s  --  potential muscular strength is highest ( where it stays until about our mid 30s ) , as is our VOsub 2 max ( how much oxygen we can pull in and use ) . After about age 25 , VOsub 2 max begins to decline about 1% per year . The erosion is slow and nearly unnoticeable . By the time we 're 70 , when we ride we can raise our V02 max only 3-4 times what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20s , we can summon a mighty 12% leap . Anaerobic ability peaks , too . Great sprinters and pursuiters , unlike stage racers or endurance riders , mature in their 20s . But few of us take advantage of the awesome potential that lies in this pause between youth and adulthood ; we become distracted by ambition and the simple logistics of living . For the rest of our working lives , riding must vie for just a share of our time . Some of us also become disenchanted because the 20s are when we discover our limitations ; when we 're children , we can all be Tour de France winners or downhill world champs . Even when faced with reality ; our bodies are temporary marvels . The resilience and recovery of youth is still with us-ride all day , party all night , do it again ( faster , this time ) . Late in our 20s , we begin to feel the keen edge of impending age , and those of us who lost cycling when we became licensed drivers often rediscover the greatest sport in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding in your mid to late 20s and you offset later extreme losses in bone density ( which also peaks in our 20s ) and lean muscle mass . Bone and muscle fade for all of us as we age-and some of the loss can be regained if you start exercising at any age-the higher your peak , the lower your final resting point . In this magic decade our bodies are more receptive to building muscle , strength and flexibility than they ever will be again-from here on out , we work much harder for smaller gains . That 's not just true of our bodies . At this age a wonderful combination of time , freedom and strength grants us our best chance to enjoy the view from a remote singletrack above the treeline-and shred the downhill and meet friends for a road spin later . But it 's a rare one of us who remembers in this decade to enjoy the feeling of the wind on our faces . Whit Johnson , 28 , does . He 's one of those riders who never lost the sport in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his neighborhood into the hills north of San Francisco , becoming a diehard mountain biker . " We just kind of rode , " he says . " We rode in short pants and tighty-whities and whatever we had . We just went out to explore and ride fast . My friend Tim Kaylor would always be in front on the downhills , but he 'd always crash . The rest of us would laugh as we rode by We never asked , Oh my God , are you okay ? ' It 'd be like , Ha ha , you were going 40 , dude , and you flipped over the bars . " ' Then Johnson went to Boulder for college and discovered mountain bike racing . He was good-rising a category a year until he took ou a pro license in ' 97 . But the pressure of racing pro pushed something out of Johnson 's life . " You can get so much tunnel vision with a goal that you forget that the means are supposed to be fun , " he says . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose , rather than the purpose being riding . " And so back to roots it was-pic rides and the occasional race among the stress of full-time graduate school in field biology . " That 's when I realized how much I need mountain biking , " he says . " How much more I need it than I ever did when racing . I 'll ride until I ca n't anymore-and you can ride your whole life . " His strategy : Stick to the basics . " Have fun . It 's as simple as that . Friends , fitness-those things come if all you want to do is have fun with a bike . Some people relieve stress with drugs , some with alcohol . Our drug is mountain biking . We go on a ride , release all our stress , smile . Then come back and do it again the next day .

We wuz wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe erectile dysfunction ( ED ) as swimmers-but it 's 45% to 2% , a statistical tie . And that 4% ? Far below the risk for the general population : A 1992 survey found that 30 million American men-30% by U.S. census figures for that year-suffer from ED . Here 's the real deal-men who participate in aerobic exercise that burns as little as 200 calories a day show the lowest risk for ED . ( This from an 8-year study of 600 men . ) Ride , boys .
