Chapter One Fate and the Modern Woman After waiting ten minutes outside the restaurant , I finally approach the hostess . I 'm cold , a bit hungry and feel like a dork standing there by myself , especially when happy couples and groups of friends suddenly become silent , part cleanly in half to go around me , leaving me there and obviously waiting for someone . " Hi , I 'm meeting someone here . Rick ? I think he made a reservation . " I step back from the podium and smile . The waiting area is crowded and people are listening intently for their names to be called . They look at me suspiciously , as if I 'm trying to exert some sort of influence and cut ahead of them . The food here ca n't be that good , can it ? " Let me check our list ... Nope , no Rick here . Do you want to put your name down for a table ? " the perky hostess asks , uncapping her Sharpie . " For a table ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's for a big party . " She smiles , still holding her pen point up . Now I see why she 's so perky-she 's high on Sharpie fumes . " Oh , OK . Natalya . " I stare down at the list , maybe he 's already here ? Maybe she 's just too high to recognize that the letters R-I-C-K spell Rick . Then again , maybe he 's stood me up . " Cool , it'llbe about fifteen minutes , maybe ten . Let me know when your boyfriend shows up ! " She puts the cap back on her pen , only to take it off as soon as the next person steps in front of her . " Oh , he 's not ... " I trail off , and sheepishly make my way to an empty sliver of wall next to the bar and stare straight ahead to give the impression that I 'm not worried about being stood up . I 'm not sure how this is supposed to work . We spoke on the phone , hit it off enough and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . I 'm here . Where is he ? " Can I get you something to drink while you 're waiting ? " This from a short , stocky guy carrying a round plastic tray . " A glass of white wine , please . " I almost add " quickly " but do n't want to come off as desperate or bitchy . Both of which wo n't serve me if my date ever gets here and definitely wo n't endear me to the wait staff , who either are stressed out or stoned-looking . " Excuse me , are you here for Lauren 's shower ? " asks a woman holding a basket of baby gifts . Panic starts to build up in the pit of my stomach . She looks nice , maybe she 'll save me . " I have no idea why I 'm here . " " Oh ... OK . " She hurries away . I do n't blame her . Lately , I 've been a tad on edge . I 've always trusted fate when it comes to my love life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life when I least expected them , like finding money in a back pocket on laundry day when you 're short of cash or a parking space opening up right in front of the dry cleaners just as you pull up . My family and friends always teased me about my knack for finding nice boyfriends , no matter where I was or the unlikelihood of the circumstances . I , of course , never bothered to question it , worry about it or even spare it much thought . I figured it was fate 's job to take care of the boyfriend part of my life so I could concentrate on other , more important things . So , OK , I admit it : It 's been four months since my last boyfriend and I called it quits and people are starting to whisper that I 've lost my magic touch , and I wonder what the hell is up with fate . " Miss ? Your wine ? " " Thank you . " I take the glass and hold on to it like a life raft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you here for Lauren 's baby shower ? " I ask her . " There 's someone else waiting over by the door . " " Thanks ! " " No problem . " I wave her on , careful not to spill wine on my new dress . A dress I went shopping for especially for this date . My first blind date and maybe my last-I obviously do n't have the nerves for this . Every family has either a spinster or a slut and I 'm on the verge of combining both-the family 's designated spinster slut . Unfair , yes , but I agree it 's time for me to be more proactive about my love life and settle down now that I 've found my professional path in life . I met my first real boyfriend when I was still in my chubby teenage years . We were together until I lost the weight and it turned out he had a thing for fat chicks . I was n't too upset because I was thin and he had needs I could n't and did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sandwich shop in the student union . I finally realized he had a thing for me when a friend pointed out my sandwich was so much better-looking than hers . I went over to thank him and we ended up going together for my freshman year . I got my whole wheat , turkey , sprouts and tomato sandwiches for free until we broke up for some silly reason or another , but that was OK . By then I was hanging out with some computer tech who worked alongside me in the campus career center and we went from friends to a couple . We lasted until the end of my sophomore year when he went for his year abroad in Greece . When I kissed him good-bye at the airport we both knew it was good-bye , good-bye , not see you when you get back . Then it was on to my boyfriend from senior year/first year out of college . We met after my car broke down and he and a friend were nice enough to give me a push to the closest gas station . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My friends loved him . He was polite , considerate , gainfully employed and good-looking , but the longer we stayed together the more it did n't feel right for me . Men were dropping like flies in front of me and I seriously entertained the thought of cheating on him just because I had the opportunities to do so . The more everyone fawned over him , the harder I looked to see what the big deal was . Eventually I figured out fate was telling me to get moving . He was " the one " for my friends and family , but not for me . Even fate is wrong sometimes . He was upset when we broke up , but we managed to stay friends and I even introduced him to the woman who he 's been with since we broke up . I wo n't be surprised if I get a wedding invitation soon , they seem like the perfect couple and she 's really nice , just like him . I 'll go and bring a nice gift with no hard feelings . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with no more than six weeks in between meeting someone and plenty of casual dates in between . Men ask me out when I least expect it , and if it feels right , I accept and things go from there . All my relationships are fun while they last and my next boyfriend could be right around the corner , sitting next to me at the DMV or in line behind me to sign in for jury duty . My last boyfriend was an accountant who helped me file my newly complicated tax forms . He said he was attracted to the fact that I made an appointment for the first Monday after New Year 's and I kept it . Little did I know this was the extent of his passion for me and life in general . He was such a bore I actually yawned during our breakup . Not to be mean , but he made me itemize the reasons why it was n't working out for me . Boredom was number three on my list . I was tactful and said it was a lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended on good terms and he 'll be doing my taxes next year , unless he raises his rates . And since then-nothing . A bunny rabbit can have four litters in as many months . A person could walk from one end of the U.S. to the other in four months . Easy . I have n't been flirted with , hit on , asked out or even checked out in all that time . These past few months have led me to the only reasonable conclusion : It 's time I took charge of my love life instead of letting fate , which is AWOL , take care of things for me . For once I 'm not waiting around until some guy has the good sense to ask me out . It 's my turn to take the initiative . Which is why I 'm now waiting for a guy in a crowded restaurant and freaking out on the inside because he 's late . Or has stood me up . I drain my glass of wine in a couple of loud gulps . Panic rising higher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Natalya , party of two ! Natalya ? " A woman wearing an ill-fitting white shirt and black pants that are shiny in all the wrong places steps out from behind the podium , looking down at a clipboard . I quickly make my way toward her to shut her up before she gives me a heart attack . " Natalya , party of- " " Hi . That 's me . " I have so much adrenaline coursing through my body I could do handsprings out the door , through the parking lot and into my car without breaking a sweat . I think I might need another glass of wine . " Where 's your other party ? It says here party of two , " she asks suspiciously , her eyes darting between me and her clipboard . " That 's right . Party of two . " Christ , she takes her job seriously . Have some Sharpie and be happy . " We can only seat complete parties . It 's Friday night . People usually do n't come here to eat alone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ podium , her hand reaching out to drop the menus on the table beside it . " He 'll be right here , " I lie and force myself not to show any hint of doubt . It 's bad enough to be waiting for someone , but I 'm not going to let some bitchy hostess spell it out for everyone in the restaurant . The strangers around me already know way too much about my personal life as it is ( not even my mom knows I 'm here ) and I do n't want them to get the idea that I 've been stood up . Why ? I do n't know . I 'm already slightly drunk and having an anxiety attack and it 's the only solid thing I can grasp on to . " He 's in the bathroom . " Who knows ? He might be . None of us can be sure he did n't have bad fish for lunch and is running behind . I let out a giggle . " Get it ? Bad fish ? Running behind ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and holds the menus protectively as if she expects me to make a lunge for them . " Sorry . He 's in the bathroom . " I give her a wide smile . Too wide , but I ca n't stop myself . People are watching , you bitch , do n't make me cry . " Fine ... this way . " She trots off without looking back at me . " Thanks , " I say as I set my butt down on the deep , very roomy chair . It 's on casters . " How convenient . " " Your server will be with you in a second . " She stomps off , avoiding eye contact with the older man waving a credit card at her . " Thanks , " I call after her . I quickly feel like a dork again , but this time a dork sitting alone in a crowded restaurant . At least outside I could hide in the shadows . Here I 'm on display for all to see : A single woman out for dinner on a Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No pictures , please ! I pretend to arrange the menu on the other side of the table , the very empty side of the table , but I know I 'm not fooling anyone . I 'm here alone . Stood up but I have too much dignity to slink out . I have as much right to this table as anyone . Even if I did have to lie to get it . I pull out my journal/day planner/organizer and finish my list of the differences between men and guys . List making , organizing , categorizing and generally putting the world into some sort of discernable order are things I do compulsively . Some people drink , other 's eat Pringles while watching Hawaii Five-O reruns , I make lists . And cook . " Hi , I 'm Wendy . Can I get you another glass of wine ? " Wendy seems nice . A little chubby but what else can you expect with the really heavy food they probably serve here ? She slides a basket of breadsticks to the middle of the table . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breadstick that 's more like warmed-up Wonder Bread rolled into stick form . I take a nibble and then a bite . Wendy starts to clear away the other place setting . " My date is on his way . " " Sorry ! " She puts it back . " Is he parking the car ? " " It 's a blind date , " I admit for no reason , and then add unnecessarily , " I got here a little early . " " Blind dates are the worst ! " Everything for Wendy seems to end in an exclamation point . " But how else are you going to meet a guy in San Francisco ? " " Tell me about it . There are plenty of gay guys to go shoe shopping with , but sometimes a girl wants a guy to do her silly in the shoes she just got on sale . " I clap my hand over my mouth . Drinking wine , cheap wine , on an empty stomach before a blind date is highly unadvisable . " I 'm so sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out loud . " " Good luck ! " Wendy leaves before I can embarrass either of us any further . " I 'll be right back with your wine ! " " Thanks ! " I look around me and smile at my fellow diners and when I do n't get any takers , I begin to refine my list , hoping to give the impression that I 'm a traveling executive on a very important project whose flight to Paris has been cancelled and this is why I 'm sitting at a coveted table in a new dress , wearing heels and a full face of makeup ... alone . May 10 , 1996 Man vs . Guy with Potential : The Definitive List Guys are good for two things : 1 ) help when you need to move something heavy , and 2 ) fast-food sex where you always know what 's on the menu and , with a little work , you can supersize it to make it worth the guilty splurge . Men , especially good ones , are few and far between and seem almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're still good for moving furniture and sex , but it 'll be your joint furniture you 're moving , and instead of just sex it 's making love . When trying to separate the men from the guys , there are four distinct markers to watch out for : 1 . The Wallet A man owns a leather wallet , in good condition and quality or old and beat-up but inherited from his grandfather . Only children and guys carry nylon Velcro " ripper " wallets in their back pockets . 2 . The Shoes Men understand the value of high-quality and stylish shoes . He 'll own at least a pair for work , a pair for going out , a weekend pair and a pair for sports . A guy who thinks a dark pair of sneakers is perfect for any occasion is a guy who thinks a special night out is a round of strip miniature golf and a blow job at the end of the night . 3 . The Watch A man understands a watch is an investment , like a car or real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good watch after a big promotion or raise , so it 's a sign his career is going somewhere . Plastic wristbands and fast-food promo watches are dead giveaways of terminal guyness . And that he 's cheap . 4 . The Clothes Sadly , you ca n't really go by clothes . Most guys and lots of men just ca n't seem to get it together in this department and if they do have it together , they 're highly suspect ( read : gay ) . Clothes are where other women or pushy sales clerks usually come into the picture . Remember , dating a stylishly dressed guy can mean that his mommy buys him everything , right down to his chones and socks . Chapter Two Dating Blind and Blind Drunk " Are you Natalya ? " " Hi ! Oh , hi ! " I dribble wine on my chin and put down my glass on the table with a thump right on my list . That 's going to leave a ring . Oh , well , I was planning on typing up my pointers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cecelia , as a joke . " I am Natalya . You must be Rick ? " " Yeah , sorry I 'm late . Transit issues . " He shrugs his shoulders and smiles at me . Very cute . Late , but very cute . " Really , I 'm sorry . It 's crazy out there . " Rick is tall , lean and clean-cut , and generally yummy with blondish hair and hazel eyes . This should be interesting . Usually I do n't go for blonds , but for him I 'll make an exception . This is , after all , my first date in months . Blind or otherwise . It 's not a big deal that he 's white . I never asked or even wondered if he was Latino , black , Asian or white . He was just Rick , my first blind date . It 's not like I have n't dated white boys before , I 've been through most of the rainbow , in fact , and do n't prefer one shade to the other . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates from team la raza . Not because she 's racist or bigoted , she just thinks it will make life easier , culture wise . " It 's pretty crazy in here !
