Chapter Two A Way to Do It // Paul O'Neill arrived at 6:15 A.M. on his first morning in office . // The President , he understood , was also an early riser - in his office by 7 A.M. - and O'Neill mused that maybe this would be part of what defined this administration : people of fortitude and clarity , always first to work . At the very least , this was one thing the President and he had in common . // His secretary , Annabella Mejia , was already there . " You 're late , " she chided . " Mr. Secretary , it 's practically afternoon . " // " Thanks , I 'll get my own coffee , " he said with a chuckle . " Can I get you anything , Annabella ? " // Before almost anyone else had arrived , O'Neill had drafted a strategic memo to the President . By midmorning , it was ready . He had his secret pact with Greenspan . But the goal of pushing forward the President 's plan was central to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could be a team player and still feel like himself . Good policy could make good politics - at least , it was possible . With a surplus number of $5 trillion - a number O'Neill understood from a friend at the Congressional Budget Office would soon rise to $5.6 trillion - he needed to help the President set the right priorities . // Memorandum to the President From : Paul H. O'Neill Subject : Tax Reform Date : January 22 , 2001 // I believe there is an opportunity to get quick action on your tax proposal if we move now . // You have won the general argument on the desirability of a tax cut and the opposition has been cornered into arguing how large the cut should be , and , their numbers are moving toward your numbers and scope .... // O'Neill knew that special interests , with their congressional advocates , were already lined up at the White House door , pushing for midsize proposals - abolishing inheritance taxes or offering a tax credit for each legitimate child - along with perennials like tax incentives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite items would create " a working majority " and " a way to get a quick victory in the tax arena , " O'Neill wrote , aware that this was something that the President 's political team found attractive . Considering the election results , any show of strength , or weakness , would be read as a trend . A quick victory was crucial . The problem , he wrote the President , was that his proposed across-the-board reductions in marginal tax rates might be left behind . // O'Neill had made his own decision about priorities . The bundle of many targeted credits and exemptions , with their myriad schedules and provisions , would be difficult to rein in with a trigger . A broad tax rate reduction would have a kind of simple , manageable clarity . It would progress , year by year , on a schedule , depending on whether there was a surplus . If the excess were to be used up , the rate reductions would halt . // Now , he had to help the President see that this was also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Growing agreement , even alarm in some quarters , with regard to the slowing economy , " O'Neill wrote , could justify swift action on this one defining issue , provided they could get a proposal to Congress in a few weeks and push through marginal rate cuts - most likely through a tweak of withholding - retroactive to January 1 . // The only congressional argument to counter this " insurance policy against the slowing economy , " he noted , would be that " it does n't fit their process . " Failure to act , moreover , would expose members to blame if the economy slipped into recession . // Embrace reality , he suggested . This plan would take us out of the " morass about the theology of economics " - a shot at anyone who might be whispering about supply-side concepts - and stress that " we care about taking practical action right now . " Meanwhile , it would leverage the current economic uncertainties . " We know the real economy has slowed and the official statistics will reflect the slowing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowness starts moving toward re-acceleration late in the second quarter , it would weaken the argument for quick action . " // After a few paragraphs about the need to stress how this rate reduction would benefit low- and middle-income Americans and " stop the drumbeat about a tax cut for the rich , " O'Neill unsheathed the blade . // In order to stay within your total tax reduction numbers and provide early implementation for marginal rates we will have to stretch out implementation of some of the other initiatives . We should argue that we will revisit implementation dates for other features , if the economy permits us to do so . // He read it , satisfied - the meat of fiscal reality , with a dash of conditionality , between two slices of political strategy - and typed in , " cc : Vice President Cheney , Larry Lindsey . " Of course , the current proposal - even if it were retroactive to January - would n't provide much actual stimulus . But if they hitched their wagon to the need for stimulus , they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... at some point . // * * * // " Pablo ? " // " Mr. President . " // " Let 's get comfortable , " George Bush said as O'Neill entered the Oval Office . // The President moved toward the wing chair near the fireplace , tucked between one of two sofa-and-chair clusters in the **30;634;TOOLONG oval . Bush sat in the wing chair facing the clock , where presidents always sit - and O'Neill sat on the near end of the small adjacent mustard-colored couch , where someone sits if he or she is the only visitor . As O'Neill navigated all this - he 'd been here many times and knew the complex seating rules - his mind raced back to a conversation with George W. Bush just before the mid-December press conference in Austin , where the President-elect had announced his nomination ... yes , there may have been a " Pablo " thrown in among the " Paul " s . O'Neill did n't think anything of it . He did n't know , back then , about Bush 's odd enthusiasm for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... and his new identity : a sixty-five-year-old man named Pablo. // " So , whatta ya got ? " the President barked , all business . // It was the afternoon of Wednesday , January 24 , the third day of the Bush administration . The President calls the meetings . It is traditional protocol . One might suggest the need for a meeting to an Andy Card or Cheney , who would then pass it along , but the President issues the summons . // Bush had O'Neill 's memo - Paul figured they 'd talk about that - and then they 'd discuss whatever came up . Cheney had said to him at one point that it might be valuable for Bush at the start of his presidency to have these meetings . To range around a bit . // O'Neill , as Treasury Secretary , institutionally designated to be the President 's leading voice on the economy , offered a fifteen-minute overview on what he considered the informed opinion ( that is , his and Greenspan 's ) and said that they were in the early stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correction . The key was to remain sober . To watch the numbers . If we look concerned and talk up recession too much , he said , it will depress spending and encourage a downturn . O'Neill explained that the major problem was not the " encumbrances on capital " - there was plenty of low-cost capital out there , unable to find a profitable home . The problem was on the consumption side . The real numbers , he assured the President , did not support the bleakness of some " economic theorists . " // O'Neill referred to items of his memo . Marginal rate cuts , if they were affordable , should be the priority . He said the tax cut plan , under almost any permutation thus far proposed , would n't provide measurable stimulus in the short term ; what would create positive economic effects is " a sense that fiscal discipline has been preserved " - something that should boost equities markets and keep long-term bond rates in check . All that left the economy well suited to respond to a rate cut from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Neill had expected Bush to ask . He was ready with the answers . How large did O'Neill consider the surplus , and how real ? How might the tax cut be structured ? What about reforming Social Security and Medicare , the budget busters ? How will we know if the economy has turned ? // Bush did n't ask anything . He looked at O'Neill , not changing his expression , not letting on that he had any reactions - either positive or negative . // O'Neill decided therefore to move from the economy to a related matter . Steel tariffs . It was a simmering issue - the U.S. steel industry was hurting and pushing for protections . He said to the President , " You were admirably clear during the campaign about your stance in support of free trade - it 's the only stance to take - and there 's no way it can be squared with tariffs . " He suggested that , as Treasury Secretary , he round up all the world 's major producers and create a structure of shared incentives and sacrifices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of this to good effect with the aluminum industry in 1993. // The President said nothing . No change in expression . Next subject . // Certainly , each president 's style is different . But O'Neill had a basis for comparison . Nixon , Ford , Bush 41 , and Clinton , with whom he had visited four or five times during the nineties for long sessions on policy matters . In each case , he 'd arrived prepared to mix it up , ready for engagement . You 'd hash it out . That was what he was known for . It was the reason you got called to the office . You met with the President to answer questions . // " I wondered , from the first , if the President did n't know the questions to ask , " O'Neill recalled , " or did he know and just not want to know the answers ? Or did his strategy somehow involve never showing what he thought ? But you can ask questions , gather information , and not necessarily show your hand . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , O'Neill shrugged - if this was to be a monologue , he 'd better make it sing . // They 'd both been at that education conference five years before , so he went with that . " No Child Left Behind , I like that , " O'Neill said , " but the idea that really moves us forward - a real action plan - is One Child at a Time . " // It was an idea he 'd road-tested with educators for years - that we need " an individualized mandate , where children would be constantly be assessed , one child at a time , in order to help create a little strategic plan for each student , " a personalized learning strategy to fill gaps and develop latent potential . " It 's a rethinking of what 's possible , Mr. President . There 's nothing more important than nurturing our human potential as a nation - our future depends on it . " // Bush shifted in the wing-back chair . " Right , that 's the concept of disaggregation " - a term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have that covered . " // O'Neill wondered if he should point out that the President might be misusing that term but thought again . Instead , he spoke of the need to rigorously assess how federal money is spent in key areas and how to get more value for each dollar and apply it " to the trillions we 've spent in foreign aid over the years ... what were the goals underlying those expenditures and what were the outcomes . " Once that evidence is gathered , O'Neill said , it would be appropriate to examine whether institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund needed restructuring . // The President seemed to nod in affirmation . O'Neill could n't be sure . // Using the same model , O'Neill proffered a structure to assess the value of America 's role in international economic crises - such as Mexico in 1995 or Indonesia in 1997 . O'Neill was no longer expecting a response . He discussed ways to apply " value analysis " to the reform of health care and shrink federal expenditures , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country 's most original thinkers . Then he offered a similar analytical framework to approach Japan 's economic woes and craft an appropriate role for the United States . // O'Neill took a breath . The Oval Office 's eighteenth-century grandfather clock - eight feet ten inches of mahogany with satinwood inlays - was to his back . He glanced at his watch . He 'd been talking for just over fifty minutes . The meeting was scheduled for an hour . // " All right , Mr. President , maybe to finish up we could talk about global climate change ... " Along with his memo on the tax cut strategy , O'Neill had sent over a booklet Alcoa had produced in 1998 with the text of an extensive speech he had given - a thorough analysis of the issue , what was known and as yet unknown , and principles to guide future actions . Bush seemed to indicate with a tilt of his head that he 'd read it . But , again , O'Neill was n't certain . // He pushed forward , adding his current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a flash point for environmental policy . He assessed the flaws of the Kyoto treaty and offered thoughts about how they might be remedied . // Both men are precise . And the hour was up . They stood at the same moment to shake hands . // " Get me a plan on global warming . " // O'Neill nodded , a bit surprised . // Bush said it again . " Get me a plan on it . " // Yes , fine , he 'd create a plan , O'Neill said . Then he slipped out of the Oval Office , wondering whether that meant he was supposed to call EPA administrator Christie Whitman - the person designated to handle that area - or to not call her . //
