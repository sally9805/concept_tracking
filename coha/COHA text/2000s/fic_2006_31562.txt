Chapter One Jack Davidson had become a stalker . Retired from Wall Street at age twenty-nine , stalker at age thirty . That was attractive . He followed Jamie Peters down into the subway , keeping an eye on her ginger hair as she paused in the crowd . She dug in her purse , cell phone to her ear , lips moving rapidly . He felt like a complete and total idiot following her , the music to Mission Impossible tripping across his brain . Spying was n't exactly his area of expertise , given that he was an exstockbroker and day trader . Numbers he could follow , but people were a whole different skill set , and he was pretty sure he looked ridiculous and obvious . Not to mention he did n't normally even breathe without planning it in a spreadsheet first . But staying out of Jamie 's business was n't an option . Not if she was caught up in something illegal without her knowledge . Or with her knowledge , which would be worse . Even though he 'd never actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , roommate , forthcoming bridesmaid . He was concerned for her safety . It was the right thing to do . Motive good and pure . That did n't make him feel any less of a jackass , though . And it was starting to occur to him that maybe he had too much time on his hands since retiring , if discoveringillegal day trading activity in a social services agency got him this excited . Deciding to switch it up a bit , he got on the train first , so maybe she would think it was a coincidence that he 'd been following her for three blocks . The bag of food in his hand was a decent alibi , too . Hell , he 'd needed some kind of reason to be hanging around outside her office for two hours . His cousin Steve had warned him this was a stupid idea , and Jack was inclined to agree with him now as he held on to a pole with one hand and turned to face out . The doors were about to close , and Jamie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still digging in her suitcase of a purse . Christ , she was going to miss it altogether . Maybe he should get back off . Or maybe he should go home and rearrange his DVDs alphabetically , which was probably a smarter use of his time . But after depositing her phone back in her purse , Jamie suddenly realized the doors were closing , and she went into action , skidding through sideways , bracelets jangling and hair bouncing . She was about to collide with a rather hard looking ex-hippie type in dirty jeans , tattoos up and down his arms . Jack quickly shifted in between them and took the impact of Jamie slamming into his chest . His pasta box burst inside the brown bag , leaking oil . Oh , yeah . This had been a stupid idea . Because when she looked up at him , horror stamped on her face , Jack felt like someone had grabbed his nuts and given them a good twist . Surprise , surprise . Jamie Peters was gorgeous . Jamie shifted her large duffel bag that served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waited for the train as she tried to decipher what Beckwith was saying . He had called her on her cell , sounding frantic , and in three minutes solid the only thing she 'd managed to understand was that it was n't a life-threatening emergency . " Why do I need to check my make-up , Beck ? " It was the end of the workday in July . The little make-up she 'd started the day with had probably slid off hours ago . " Because it 's now ! Or like really soon , anyway . I was at the handbag sale at Saks-got the cutest little Kate Spade-anyway , it just hit me , right there , at the counter . You 're going to meet him today . " " Him ? " Jamie repeated , this call finally starting to make sense . She had a pretty good idea of where Beckwith was going with this . The tarot card prediction . Intrigued-no , make that freaked out-she stopped trying to shove her subway swipe card in her bag . " It 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . " Thank goodness . The problem with believing in Beckwith 's psychic ability was now that he had predicted something she 'd really rather he had n't , she was stuck waiting for it to happen . Why could n't she be a total skeptic like Allison ? At first Jamie had been seriously on the lookout for Mr. Right , the dishonest dream man . She had walked cautiously past the melons in the grocery store and had scrutinized the deliveryman carefully when she 'd ordered a veggie pizza twice . She 'd even taken to using the stairs at work instead of the elevator like she normally did since movement had been integral in Beckwith 's prediction . Nothing . No scary accidents with men fated to make her happy . But Jamie was optimistic by nature . It served her well in social work . She had figured the man Beckwith had described would show up eventually , which did not thrill her in the least . Not only was it a little unnerving to imagine accidents around every corner , but she was absolutely certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal assets added up to more than his T-shirt collection and a carton of Marlboro Reds . Since the thought of both breaking her leg and meeting a man who wore a suit or something crazy like that gave her cold sweats , she had pushed the prediction to a back corner of her mind . It was going to happen sooner or later , she was convinced , but if that time was now , why could n't she be looking cuter ? As it was , she probably resembled a Brillo pad with eyes . " There 's no time frame on destiny , " Beckwith said with great dignity . Nor was destiny something she sat around and thought about on a regular basis . It certainly had n't been in her thoughts that day at all . And at the moment she just wanted to get home and pull a pint of ice cream out of the freezer and inhale it . Then she could meet the man of her dreams . After she 'd gained five pounds from the mint chocolate chip . Shoot , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul mate saw her and ran screaming , she would be humiliated on top of everything else . Maybe she should skip the ice cream and have a salad with low-cal dressing . " I 'm on my way home , you know . And I was n't planning to do anything tonight but paint my toenails , so I do n't see how I could meet anyone . Maybe the handbags interfered with your radar . Maybe I see him tomorrow . " That would be better anyway . Digging through her purse to put her swipe card away , she sensed movement and realized everyone around her was surging forward . Dang it . The train was here , and she would be last one on . There was nothing worse than folding yourself into a full subway car and sharing your personal space with approximately thirty people of various age and odor . " Got ta go , Beckwith ! I 'll call you later , sweetie . " Running as fast as wedge sandals would allow her , she launched herself through the doors as they began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold on to . Not fast enough . The car moved again with a frantic lurch , and Jamie went stumbling forward , her handbag clipping the woman in the seat to her right . " Watch it , " the woman said . But Jamie could n't apologize . She could n't speak . Because the man she had collided with in her forward motion was him . Him of the tarot cards . Him of the light brown hair , the minor accident ... She looked at his chest . And the food . Now crushed against him in a brown bag that was leaking some kind of oily sauce from multiple directions . " Oh , " she said . Beckwith had been so completely right . It was disarming , unsettling , weird , not as bad as she 'd thought . It even felt a little ... wonderful . His hand was on her arm , gripping it firmly to keep her steady . It was a strong hand . A warm hand . Oh , my . Jamie stared up at him and smiled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ventured , not exactly sure what she should say to the man of her destiny . He smiled back , showing white teeth in a somewhat crooked grin . " I 'll be alright , but I do n't think my shirt will ever recover . " When he shifted the bag of food , she saw that he was now wearing a red sauce on his white T-shirt . Her hand came up without thought to brush it , but he shook his head . " It 's without hope . Do n't bother . " " Aaaah . I 'm such a klutz . I 'll pay you for the shirt . " The train came to a stop , and Jamie was pushed and jostled as four or five people moved around her to get off . She was pressed up against him , a blush starting to creep up her face . They were close enough that if she were to tilt her head up , they could kiss . He had a strong jaw and smelled like soap and tomatoes . The need to fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fritz , or she was experiencing an explosive burst of lustful heat . Chances were it was the latter . He shrugged , the movement drawing her attention to his broad shoulder . She fought the urge to squeeze his biceps . Beckwith had n't warned her about the sexy factor . This guy was built like a race horse . No , that did n't sound right . He was ... was ... lickable . Before Beckwith had spouted off about marriage , her original thought had been that she was destined for a rather fun affair , her first strictly steamy relationship . Looking at super sexy in front of her , she thought he was probably capable of fun with a capital F. Hopefully unaware of her lecherous thoughts , he said , " Do n't worry about it . I mourn my ruined dinner more than my ruined shirt . " " Italian ? " she guessed , thinking of the tomato scent . A stale , hot pocket of air fluttered over her as he nodded . " Spaghetti and meatballs . With garlic bread . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this guy . He probably did n't even own a suit , given how comfortable he looked in his jeans . And his eyes were blue , swimming with amusement and perhaps hunger . For his pasta . " I 'm so sorry about your dinner . I 'd offer to take you out to replace it , but you could be weird or something . " Weird ? Oh , geez , why had she said that ? Jamie wanted to groan . Followed by a mental kick in her sundress-covered behind . It was intelligent and important for a single woman to be cautious , but heck , she could have phrased that differently . But he only grinned . " No weirder than anyone else in New York . " Staring up at that cute grin , Jamie knew she could n't let this moment pass . He had to be the man in Beckwith 's prediction , and she could n't let him get off this subway without making plans to see him again , in a safe , public place . Even if she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was not going to let this guy get off this train and turn her life into a romantic tragedy . This was n't about marriage . Beckwith had said soul mate , and that phrase had the word mate in it , which was really a polite way to say sex . Maybe that 's what this really was . They would date . Sleep together . Then he would move on like all the other guys , and she would whistle as she walked away , heart intact and body happy for a while . Not that she 'd ever engaged in a wild , steamy affair before . Men did n't see her that way , and she was more inclined to pack a man 's lunch than to grope him . She was modest to a fault when it came to her body , and maybe this was what fate had in mind for her . Sensual liberation . Just looking at him made her feel pretty darn liberated . Dang , that sounded like a good plan . For once , to just let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a man look at her and want , want , want . " That 's true , there are plenty of weirdos running around . And I do feel just terrible . " Then she added in a breathless rush before she lost her nerve , " So how about dinner , then ? " He studied her for a second , his blue eyes darting down to her chest and back up again . She wished she had worn one of those body-clinging dresses that Allison favored , but instead she was covered in one of her standard loose-fitting , draping , no-waist dresses . When the silence drew out , a sudden horrifying thought popped into her head . " Unless you 're married , or dating someone or something . That 's fine . I just thought that I could , you know , make it up to you , because of what happened when I tripped . I was n't implying anything ... " Shut up , shut up , shut up , she told herself . Babbling was never a good thing . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arm , only it loosened and relaxed , until he was stroking her skin . A shiver ran through her . " Jamie . Jamie The Klutz . " He grinned again , little lines forming in the corners of his very close , very moist , very kissable lips . " Well , Jamie The Klutz , I 'm Jack . Jack the unmarried and unattached . " Stroke , stroke on her arm . She struggled to control herself . It would be very embarrassing if she fainted on the subway . Her dress would probably slide up , and everyone would see her underwear , which was unbleached cotton . Environmentally responsible , but majorly unsexy . " And I would like to go out to dinner with you , Jamie The Klutz . Tomorrow ? Neutral territory ? " " Sure . But what 's neutral ? " " Times Square . If I 'm weirder than you thought , then you can ditch me in the crowd of tourists . " She laughed . As if . He would probably need a fire hose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Seven ? Mama Luigi 's on Forty-fourth ? They have a patio , so if you need to escape you can leap over the fence to get away from me . " " Okay . " He looked around her . " This is my stop . " " Okay . " Nothing brilliant , witty , or original came to mind to say , so she smiled again as he let go of her and stepped off the train . " See you tomorrow . " He waved , clutching his leaky pasta bag and grinning at her . Jamie gulped as the doors closed , then turned in search of a seat to sink into . She needed it before she collapsed in a heap of tangled legs to rival Jack 's spaghetti . She had met him . The One . Chapter Two Jack watched the door close in fascinated silence . What the hell had just happened ? He sucked at this spy thing . The point of following someone was to stay incognito , which he had n't exactly done . Garlic was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted her to crash into Free Love , the aging hippie . He had thought to save her discomfort and embarrassment . Now he was standing on the platform with a giant red stain on his shirt , staring at Jamie The Klutz as she smiled shyly at him . It was a smile that went straight to his groin . Damn , she was hot . She glowed . It was true . There was a rosy , peach color to her everywhere , from the rich auburn of her curly hair to the blush of her cheeks , to the riotous flowers on her dress . She was just ... peachy . Which made him hungry . And made him want to see what she looked like naked . See where else she might be peaches and cream . He came close to groaning out loud at the thought . The door had long since closed , the train pulled away , and he was still standing there , like the horny idiot that he was . He checked his watch . Only twenty-five and a half hours until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As long as he did n't think about her chest , hiding behind that loose floral dress , but glorious nonetheless . It brought to mind all sorts of metaphors about flowers and fruit , with words like ripe , budding , and juicy rising up and tormenting him . He took the stairs to the street two at a time and ordered his hormones to lie down and play dead . It did n't work . His sister owed him an explanation . Never once when talking about her roommate had she mentioned Jamie was a sexual goddess with breasts that could stop traffic , war , and obliterate the need for Jack to hang on to the Victoria 's Secret catalog that had been accidentally delivered to his apartment . Ten lust-filled minutes later he stepped into his grandfather 's room at the nursing home and found him sitting in his recliner , watching a game show . " Hey , Pops , how are you ? " " Stuck in this hell hole , but other than that , no complaints . " " Come on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Living in a nursing home must be an anticlimactic ending to life . It was a rehabilitative facility , but Jack got the impression Pops felt this was the beginning of the end . One stay led to another until you never went home . " It 's nice here . It does n't smell or anything . " " Hah . You have n't been here on taco day . " Pops turned and studied him . " What 's all over your shirt ? " " Your dinner . " He 'd bought it for his grandfather in the first place , being more of a pesto sauce , lean chicken kind of guy . But he was n't sure how appealing it was going to be now that it had bounced around the inside of the bag . " Spaghetti . It got shoved against me by this woman on the subway . " Pops narrowed his eyes as his gaze dropped . " You 've got a hard-on , Jack . " ( Continues ...
