Recovering human remains and removing the mountain of debris in lower Manhattan will be an enormous , grim and time-consuming job , but at least there is no doubt about what needs to be done . Once the area has been cleared , the next step is far less certain . Should the World Trade Center be rebuilt , as Mayor Giuliani seemed to promise last week ? Or should the 16-acre site be turned into a memorial for the thousands who perished there ? <P> At this point , no one at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , which owned the buildings , is prepared to make any such decisions  --  and even the mayor has admitted that " rebuild " does n't necessarily mean rebuild in their original form . <P> There is , of course , no technical obstacle to reconstructing the Twin Towers , and some terrorism experts think there are good reasons for doing so . " You want to send the message that we wo n't allow this to permanently change our society , " says Ric Stoll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be one way to get that message across . <P> After World War II , reconstruction of iconic buildings was a major civic project in some bombed-out European cities , a way of affirming continuity and triumph over death . Vienna , for example , spent decades rebuilding the medieval Cathedral of St. Stephen . <P> But restoring the Twin Towers is a different proposition . The cost would run into billions of dollars , and it 's hard to imagine tenants lining up for space in buildings that would be targets for terrorists even before they went up . On the other hand , this field of rubble occupies one of the world 's most valuable pieces of real estate in an area where tens of thousands of people need a place to work . Another possibility , therefore , would be to rebuild but in a different form that would allow the new structures to serve as a memorial to those who died . <P> Whatever is built may be seen as a de facto memorial . Says Carol Ross Barney , who designed the new federal building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 bombing : " I do n't know if you can build anything that 's not a symbol . Every building tells you what people were thinking when they built it . " But Oklahoma City erected a separate memorial nearby , and aside from its symbolic presence , says Barney , " there 's nothing about the building that specifically commemorates the bombing . " <P> Perhaps New York City will eventually adopt a similar solution : new structures quite unlike the old as well as a separate memorial . Whatever happens , says Hans Butzer , who co-designed Oklahoma City 's memorial , it should n't happen in a hurry : " One of the things that proved to be so useful for Oklahoma City was the process by which the community tried to make sense of the tragedy . It was open and participatory . While it may be prudent for politicians to make bold statements or shows of courage and strength , it may not be wise in the long run to be deciding right now how we should react .
