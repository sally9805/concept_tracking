Thousands of misbehaving kids are sent to " boot camps " by their stressed-out parents every year . Some-like 12-year-old Mikey Wiltsie - never make it home alive . // MICHAEL WILTSIE HAD ALWAYS BEEN A HANDFUL , perpetually restless , even in his mother 's womb . " I used to tell the doctor , " He never sleeps , ' ' " Linda Ibarra , 33 , fondly recalls . He would zoom through their house in Anthony , Florida , dismantling clocks , the radio , the TV , just to see how they worked . Consequences rarely scared him . When he was 5 , he got his hands on a kitchen knife , and his mother ended up with a superficial cut from trying to wrest it away . Day-care workers complained that he was aggressive . When Ibarra turned to her pediatrician for advice , his rather unhelpful response was " Boys will be boys . " Yet Mickey was n't like most other boys . When he was 8 and shoplifted a water gun , his mother tried the time-honored tactic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the perils of stealing . The lesson did n't stick , and soon he was being arrested for more shoplifting , for vandalizing an empty trailer , and for puncturing the tires on a neighbor 's bike . Mickey was almost always genuinely contrite , but even his penitence could be self  --  destructive . Once , tired of constantly being in trouble , he locked his family out of the house , then set a newspaper on fire . " He told me he did n't want to live anymore , " says Ibarra , who immediately had her son undergo a psychological evaluation . Mikey was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and oppositional defiant disorder ( meaning he was chronically disobedient ) . Placed on Ritalin , Mikey made a remarkable turnaround . Able to focus on his schoolwork , he began getting As and even tutored other kids in math . Photograph Photograph Photograph Linda Ibarra weeps as she holds a photo of her son , Mikey , after a grand jury refused to indict a camp counselor in Mikey 's death . // Despite improving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friends and family describe him as sweet ( every day after school in fifth grade , he told his teacher " I love you " ) , but he continued to be arrested for crimes such as vandalism and burglary . When Mikey violated the curfew that was a condition of his probation , a juvenile-court judge overruled mental-health specialists who recommended intensive psychiatric treatment , and the 12-yearold ended up being sentenced to a stay in a military-style wilderness boot camp . Mikey 's mom was counting on its tough discipline to straighten her son out . She did n't count on it killing him . THE PROMISE Boot camps have become increasingly popular over the past decade . Thousands of children with behavior problems are sent to them every year by exasperated parents or by the courts . The promise of the programs is compelling : that basically good , but troubled , kids can be diverted from lives of crime by being made to spend a few months with strict disciplinarians in the outdoors . The experience is intended to build a child 's confidence and character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time or another , many parents feel like throwing up their hands and sending their kids away to be fixed , " says Barry Krisberg , president of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency in Oakland . " Parents get tired and desperate , " agrees child psychiatrist Bruce Perry , M.D. , Ph.D. , medical director for provincial programs in children 's mental health in Alberta , Canada . " They seek someone who will tell them it 's all going to be OK . And when the disruptive child is out of the house , they feel relief . They want to believe that their children are being taken care of . " When Ibarra took her son to visit Camp E-Kel-Etu , a private Florida facility surrounded by a lush 380,000-acre wilderness preserve , Mikey seemed eager to go fishing and to learn survival skills . " I 'll be roughing it , " he told his mother proudly . The program director was impressed with Mikey 's selfawareness ; the boy admitted he needed help with " impulse control " and " getting along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mikey was a good candidate , " says Ibarra . " He was so excited ; I thought it was perfect . " Things started out well . In a letter Mikey wrote to his mother on his second day away , he assured her he would be fine . But after he 'd been at the camp about a week , his impressions changed . " Mama , I 'm so scared , " he told her over the phone . " I 'll never get in trouble again . " Ibarra was told that Mikey had been physically restrained by his counselor for throwing soap at the other boys , but she later learned that he had been thrown facedown on the ground . " Had I known , I would have done everything in my power to get him out of there , " she says . Thirteen days after the soap incident , Mikey got into an argument with the boys in his group . According to witnesses , counselor Joe Cooley tried to defuse the situation verbally . When Mikey would n't back down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy to the ground , pinned him down , and straddled him . Witnesses later told investigators that Mikey , whose nose was congested that day , complained that he could n't breathe . When he stopped moving , the counselor stayed put , believing Mikey was " playing possum . " When Cooley got off Mikey and told him to get up , the boy still was n't moving . Cooley tried to find a pulse but could n't . He began CPR while another staffer administered epinephrine . Mikey never regained consciousness . Ibarra is still haunted by the vision of her son in the hospital , a breathing tube down his throat , dirt and mud stuck to his eyes , ears , and teeth . " Why is he so filthy ? " she remembers asking . A nurse finally explained that the dirt was evidence . Mikey 's death was being treated as a crime . AN " EPIDEMIC OF ABUSE " Michael Wiltsie 's is one of at least three dozen deaths that have occurred at wilderness camps in the past decade . On September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrate what would have been his thirteenth birthday , 15-year-old William " Eddie " Lee died in almost identical circumstances at a camp called Obsidian Trails in Oregon . Last July the Maricopa County sheriff 's office shut down a camp 40 miles west of Phoenix and launched a criminal investigation after the death of 14-year-old Anthony Haynes . A preliminary autopsy showed that the boy , dehydrated and disoriented after being forced to stand in the desert sun , died after being left unattended in a shower . His apparent infraction : He 'd said he wanted to go home . Krisberg describes these deaths as part of an " epidemic of abuse " at residential camps for chronically disobedient kids . The programs-some public , some private-are regulated poorly if at all . Most do n't provide professional psychiatric care , and counselors are n't required by law to receive any special education . When programs do offer training ( Mikey 's counselor , Cooley , attended a 28-day course and was certified in CPR ) , it 's rarely as rigorous as experts recommend . At many camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that some counselors , such as Charles Long , who ran the camp Anthony Haynes went to , even have criminal records . Long has been in trouble with the law at least twice : he was arrested for trying to break into a former girlfriend 's house with a sledgehammer , and fined and put on probation for punching her . " It 's a major problem , " says Jerry Wells , executive director of the Koch Crime Institute of Topeka , Kansas , who studies boot camps . " Without training , staff members may fail to understand the damage that can be done by employing overzealous punishment . " Paul DeMuro , a national juvenile  --  justice consultant , says he 's seen kids running in the hot sun with tires around their waists , mopping floors with their T-shirts and then being forced to put the shirts back on , and exercising so much they end up vomiting . Mark Soler , president of the Washington , D.C.-based Youth Law Center , helped investigate a juvenile facility in Plankinton , South Dakota , after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he saw : a barbed-wire maximum-security detention center where some kids were shackled and locked in isolation 23 hours a day for 30 days in a row . Mental-health care was grossly inadequate and the staff was poorly trained , he says . The Youth Law Center filed suit on behalf of the 120 children who were living in the facility . The state has since settled , promising to improve staff training and to allow inspections by outside monitors . " There is not a lot of very serious juvenile crime in South Dakota , " says Soler . " These kids were locked up for things like truancy and curfew violations . Yet there was this extremely punitive attitude which was not geared toward helping them . " TALK-SHOW THERAPY Some states have begun to crack down on the camps . The death of Score-who was sentenced to boot camp after stealing Beanie Babies from a store and money from a school locker-created such a furor that South Dakota vowed to take a closer look at its entire residential program for juveniles . There were so many complaints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Maryland followed suit after the Baltimore Sun , in a 1999 expose , ran pictures of counselors physically abusing children . Yet experts estimate that 50 to 100 such camps are still in business nationwide , fueled in part by daytime TV shows that continue to feature sullen teenagers who go away for brief stints , then return beatifically transformed . Just two months after Haynes 's death and the shuttering of the camp he attended , Charles Long began to operate a new , similar program . " The families who are featured on our shows have contacted us , often desperate , asking for help , " says Amy Rosenblum , executive producer of the Maury show , explaining why it continues to run boot-camp segments . But while individual parents swear that boot camps have changed their children 's lives , there is no evidence the approach reliably turns troubled kids into responsible citizens . " They boot camps were developed by men who had positive experiences in the military , " says DeMuro , " but no one bothered to study them first . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the more alarming parts are the failures , " says Wells , who found that recidivism rates for graduates of juvenile boot camps range from 64 to 75 percent-no better than those in ordinary juvenile-correction programs . " The problem is the basic concept : that you must tear people down before building them back up . The data just do n't support it . " In fact , studies show that sending kids away from home is usually not the best solution . Most kids with behavior problems-up to 80 percent-eventually grow out of them , according to Lynn Ponton , M.D. , a professor of child psychiatry at the University of California , San Francisco . The programs that have proved most effective over time are those that are structured but that provide empathetic treatment and support for the entire family and allow troubled children to stay at home . Says Krisberg , " We 've become afraid of our children . So when they get into trouble , we respond with tough love . My response to that is , tough love kills . " FACING THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family was n't sure how their daughter had died until they heard the first details on a news report a few weeks later . Gina , who weighed 226 pounds , collapsed from heat exhaustion during a forced three-mile run in hot , humid weather . Her pleas for help were ignored : As she hyperventilated , eyewitnesses later said , counselors taunted her , accusing her ( as happened with the others who died ) of faking her weakness . Gina struggled to stand , then collapsed again and was left lying in the sun for three hours . By the time she arrived at the hospital , her temperature registered 108-as high as the thermometer would go . " How , " David Score asks bitterly , " could anyone treat another human being that way ? " Linda Ibarra , Michael Wiltsie 's mother , has been asking the same question . After a Marion County , Florida , grand jury failed to indict her son 's counselor , concluding that Cooley had properly followed the restraint procedure he had been taught , she filed a wrongfuldeath suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kel-Etu , and a federal suit for violation of Mikey 's civil rights . Ibarra insists that she is not looking for money . She just wants someone to accept responsibility for what happened to her son . " This man crushed my child , " she says . " Just as Michael had to face the consequences of his behavior , someone will face the consequences of causing his death . " Sidebar What really works Sidebar Every kid can be difficult at times . But what do you do when your child is always in trouble at home and at school , when his behavior is dangerous , when he is disobeying the law ? Here 's what juvenile-justice experts advise : * Seek treatment , but try to keep your kid at home . Experts agree that the most effective programs focus on helping kids get along better with their families and keep them connected to caring people in their neighborhoods and schools . * Discuss the problem with a pediatrician , who should be able to tell you about children 's mentalhealth services in your area . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessment . Many kids with behavior problems are clinically depressed or have a learning disorder or other medical problem that can be successfully treated if it 's properly diagnosed . * Consider attending family therapy or a parenting-skills class . Often a child acts out in response to problems at home . Also , these sessions can teach you techniques for modifying your child 's negative behavior. * If your child is arrested , hire the very best lawyer you can afford : someone who will get him out of the criminal justice system . This allows you-not a judge or probation officer- to make decisions about treatment . It can also protect your Sidebar child from the long-term stigma of incarceration in the criminal justice system . * Do n't enroll your child in a residential program that is not licensed or accredited by the state . * Do n't jump at the first residential program you see or be impressed by its beautiful website or by the director 's stories of miracles . Do your own investigation : Ask about discipline policies , complaint procedures ( can your child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , counseling methods , and staff-specifically the number of licensed , experienced medical and mental-health professionals . Talk with parents of children who 've graduated from the program , Sidebar but ask if they are paid by the program to refer others , and avoid it if they are . Search the Internet for news articles about possible problems with each institution you consider . * Do n't enroll your child in a residential program that provides no follow-up service . Experts say a lack of aftercare is say a major reason so many residential treatment programs fail . * Do n't send your child to program outside the U.S. or to one that sets excessive limits on parent-child contact . * Do n't despair . Even the most troubled children , including those who get in trouble repeatedly or who do n't get any treatment at all , usually settle down eventually . // <p>
