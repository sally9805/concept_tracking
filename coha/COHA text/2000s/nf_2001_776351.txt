Deep ( RS/6000 SP ) Blue // " I 'm a human being . When I see something that is well beyond my understanding , I 'm afraid . " // Gary Kasparov was n't just another great chess player , the master of all grandmasters . By universal agreement , he was the greatest chess player in history . In the spring of 1997 , at the age of thirty-four , at the peak of the long boom , he had held his world championship for twelve years . Never once had he lost a multigame match against an individual opponent . Never once had he displayed anything but absolute assurance in his chess genius . His attitude toward any rival bordered on the contemptuous , a trait he displayed again after winning , as expected , the first of six games in his heralded rematch that May in New York against an opponent he had soundly defeated just a year before . // As the match resumed , chess experts who gathered to watch the great champion crush his foe witnessed something so unexpected they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observers intently following the contest over the Internet and via worldwide television hookups were astonished to see Kasparov show uncharacteristic signs of confusion . First , he displayed growing doubt , followed by dismay , despair , and loss of control . Finally , he seemed to be having an emotional breakdown . He appeared to be terror stricken . // The first sign that the champion was on the verge of a crackup came during the second game . It was then that Kasparov encountered something unique in his experience . In the past , he was always able to exploit an opponent 's weaknesses by understanding the pattern of thought being employed against him . This time he could not . // That second game ended in a draw . Another draw followed . Then his opponent won a game . When the contestants resumed play on a Saturday , the match was dead even . Kasparov began aggressively , brilliantly ; he knew he was winning . His opponent fought back with a series of inspired , indeed brutal , moves that left Kasparov visibly shaken . Grandmasters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , seem pitiful . He was forced to accept another draw . After a day 's break in the match , the denouement came on Monday . // Worldwide attention intensified . Television networks assigned correspondents to cover the event for their lead prime-time broadcasts . Newspapers dispatched top writers , not just their chess analysts , and prepared to open their front pages to report the final results . They and millions more watching on TV and the Internet saw the great Garry Kasparov , the consummate champion whose supreme confidence was matched only by his arrogance , replaced by a nervous , hollowed-out player , his eyes darkened , his manner brooding . He appeared beaten before making his first move . // Kasparov grew even more dispirited as his opponent 's swift , ruthless moves drove him into a corner . In a riveting moment captured on television screens , and later on newspaper front pages , after having lost his queen and with his king dangerously exposed to checkmate , the champion leaned forward over the chessboard . He placed his hands over his face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enduring portrait of human despair . // Moments later Kasparov suddenly stood up . He was resigning the game and match , he announced . Only nineteen moves had been played . // Grandmasters were amazed at the way the champion abruptly crumbled . " It had the impact of a Greek tragedy , " said the chairman of the chess committee responsible for officiating the match . Kasparov reacted more simply . " I lost my fighting spirit , " he said . " I was not in the mood of playing at all . " // Asked to explain why , at a tumultuous news conference minutes later , he replied , " I 'm a human being . When I see something that is well beyond my understanding , I 'm afraid . " // * * * // Kasparov 's opponent had no reaction , maintaining the same state as when the battle began : motionless , positioned inside a bare windowless air-conditioned closet , high over the city in a midtown Manhattan skyscraper , its immense size and weight all but unattended by any human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supercomputer , christened by its creators " Deep Blue . " This behemoth , whose twin metallic structures were described by one New York Times writer as resembling nothing so much as amplifiers at a rock concert , stood six feet five inches tall . Each of its towers weighed twenty-eight hundred pounds , for a combined weight of over 2 3/4 tons . Internally , its 516 chess microprocessors were capable of examining 200 million chess positions a second , or 50 billion every three minutes , all while operating at a speed 250 times faster than desktop computers . // In the year since Kasparov had first bested Deep Blue , IBM technicians had doubled its capacity . They also conducted near-daily brainstorming sessions with programmers , researchers , and outside chess experts . Their efforts were rewarded by a spectacular success . In the glow of their triumph , Deep Blue 's project manager , C.J. Tan , was magnanimous in victory and praised the dejected Kasparov . " Garry has a brilliant mind , and he 's a very brave man , " Tan said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understands where technology can take us . " When asked by reporters why there had been such global interest in the match , Tan replied : " Because it shows what technology can do for man and how far we can take it . " // * * * // As a news story , the match was a natural : Man versus Machine . Machine wins . As a modern fable , it was fulfillment of an age-old dream . For centuries , scientists and charlatans alike had envisioned the day when machines would beat humans at the intellectually demanding game of chess . After countless failures , that day had come . // Though die-hard chess purists disparaged Deep Blue 's victory as nothing more than a highly hyped gimmick , a mechanical game without real significance , it represented something far more important . It was a symbol of the times , a herald of the future . // Long before the match , IBM 's supercomputer already had proved its immense value by becoming essential to the successful functioning of the end-of-the-century world . The same type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabled millions to watch the chess match around the globe . These computers were also used for a wide variety of other purposes : to enable the newly designed Internet to link people everywhere in ways never before possible ; to design new drugs for pharmaceutical companies ; to process enormous amounts of data , allowing for computations critical for success in such diverse areas as molecular fluid dynamics , market analysis , and even the functioning of world financial markets ; to allow genetic engineers to map genomes of various species , promising to bring revolutionary changes in the very structure and function of life ; to simulate nuclear explosions ; to coordinate airline reservation and air traffic control systems ; to guide rockets as they plunge deep into the universe , exploring other planets and perhaps discovering conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life . // All these and far more were now part of the rapidly expanding province of the computer . Suddenly human technology was transforming life in the most mundane and the most unimaginable ways , directly affecting individuals , businesses , and nations everywhere . Now computers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to discover previously unnoted trends : a convenience store found that premium beers sold better on Friday nights if located next to diapers and Victoria 's Secret realized that women 's breast sizes vary in different parts of the country and adjusted their inventories in individual stores accordingly . Welcome to Technotimes . It was a brave new world , and the computer was king . Without it , the long boom could not have happened . The computer provided the catalyst that ignited the enormous burst of economic energy in the Nineties . Fueled by expanding technologies , including the acceleration of the computer industry itself , new businesses and new fortunes were created at an unprecedented pace . // In the pop-culture aftermath of the match between Kasparov and the supercomputer , journalists scrambled to publish features tracing Deep Blue 's antecedents to show how they led to a crowning moment of the computer age . In so doing , they perpetuated one of the great myths of how Technotimes , with all its promise and potential problems , came to be . // * * * // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise of new entrepreneurs , bold risk-taking venture capitalists who became the richest of the very rich . The fable comes in two parts . The first , an Eighties tale , tells of youthful geniuses tinkering in garages and emerging with new discoveries that created new technologies that formed new businesses that produced new fortunes . The second , a Nineties tale , tells of young computer " geeks " and " nerds " enjoying the most luxuriant lifestyles after capitalizing beyond wildest dreams from overnight start-up ventures and IPOs that left them , still in their twenties , richer than any Americans before them , richer than their Gatsbyesque counterparts in the Roaring Twenties , richer than those favored few of the Gilded Age in the 1880s. // There 's truth in the tales , but as always with tales of heroes , their exploits are colored as much by myth as by reality . // The myth , formed in part by arrogant self-promotion and in part by lack of historical perspective , is that it all began with them . Out of their own singular talents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the universe . The reality tells a different story . Long before Bill Gates and other icons of the dazzling new Technotimes were born , long before popular accounts of their fabulous fortunes fired the public imagination , many of the great developments that ignited the boom were already solidly in place . Interactive computing , software engineering , the Internet , e-mail  --  all these and much more were waiting to be seized and used , thanks to decades-long creative efforts and strong financial support of others . Not least was the indispensable backing of the American people and their government , which together had mobilized all the resources of the society  --  economic , physical , and intellectual  --  in a common partnership that made possible the wonders of the age to come and the great boom that transformed it . // That 's the story those historical accounts missed when chronicling Deep Blue 's triumph over the great chess master . Focusing on the powers of the new machines without examining how they achieved such power or questioning what problems they might be creating , as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crashing on shore without explaining the seismic activities and midoceanic undercurrents that caused them to crash with such force . //
