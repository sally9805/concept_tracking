GAS STATION : Chasing The Hidden Penny // Regular Unleaded $1.61 9/10 // Twin Peaks Petroleum sits at a welcoming angle to a busy San Francisco intersection . On this morning in the summer of 2003 , a thick fog has crawled over the station , folding each of the eight drivers standing at the pumps in an envelope of cold mist . At the back of the lot sits a garage where a small convenience store glows . On the storefront is a poster of an ebullient snowman clutching a cola , while icicle letters drip the words COLD POP over his head . Inside the convenience store , among the security cameras and parabolic mirrors , the Doritos , cigarettes , and Snapples , jammed into a space no larger than a postal truck , a tall man with dark circles under his eyes appears to doze . His eyelids hang low , twitching ; he mumbles ; he moves with excruciating deliberation as he counts change . // I am leaning against a shelf holding several grades of motor oil , individually wrapped strawberry cheesecake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , regular , nacho cheese , and ranch . I am no more lively than B. J. , the droopy manager . And I am recording the flavors of corn nuts in my notebook to stay awake . " Corn Gone Wrong " say the packages . I record that too . I ? ve come to the gas station to watch Americans buy gasoline , as a way of understanding how we fit into the trillion-dollar world oil economy . But now that I ? m here , I realize I ? ve been here before , bought gas so many times myself I feel there ? s nothing to see . The fumble , the stuporous swipe of the card , the far-off look : I know them well . Gas stations are everywhere , but when you ? re in one , you ? re nowhere in particular . Icicle letters are taking shape in my head : WHAT DID YOU EXPECT ? // I keep writing : Trojan spermicidally lubricated snugger fit , two Sominex and a folded paper cup , phone cards , batteries , air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeting card with a picture of a pansy and the words " You ? re too nice to be sick . " The customers standing out at the pumps have a preoccupied , anxious look  --  could they be distracted enough to buy a card that says " You ? re too nice to be sick " ? // Gas stations are collections of incidental items , impulses , and routines that seem in themselves to be inconsequential but aggregate into a goliath economy when multiplied by the hungers of 194 million licensed American drivers . Corn nuts , for example , are part of $4.4 billion in salty snacks sold at gas station convenience stores yearly , nearly all impulse buys . The hopeful purchase $25 billion in lottery tickets . People with the sniffles spent $323 million on cold medicine at gas stations in 2001 . And the faint smell of gasoline near the pumps ? In California alone , the amount of gasoline vapor wafting out of stations , as we fill our cars , totals 15,811 gallons a day  --  roughly the equivalent of two full tanker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ? ve collaborated to create a culture of speed , convenience , low prices , and 64-ounce cup holders , which allow us to express what the industry calls our " passion for fountain drinks . " Japanese auto executives have hired American anthropologists to explain the mystery of why the purchase of a $40,000 car hangs on the super-sizing of the cup holder . // And then there is the gasoline : 1,143 gallons per household per year , purchased in two-and-a-half-minute dashes . We make 16 billion stops at gas stations yearly , taking final delivery on 140 billion gallons of gasoline that has traveled around the world in tanker ships , pipelines , and shiny silver trucks . And then we peel out , get on with our real lives , get back on the highway , or go find a restroom that ? s open , for Pete ? s sake . // With a wave of our powerful credit cards , American drivers buy one-ninth of the world ? s crude oil production per day . That makes us elephants in the global oil economy-our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villages in Africa , the Amazon , and the Arctic , to the highest towers in Vienna , Riyadh , and New York . When we lick our lips , they open their taps . When we are in a funk , their governments fall . Here in front of the pump , surrounded by buntings in the joyful colors of children ? s birthday party balloons , we have the opportunity to be our truest selves in the great , over-the-top drama/business that is the world oil supply chain . // But as you know , buying gas can be done by the living dead . Swipe card , insert nozzle , punch the button with the greasy sheen : Gasoline flows into the tank while money flows out of the bank account . Filling a car seems less like making a purchase than a ritual , a formality that isn ? t quite real . // It ? s not even clear what we ? re buying  --  gasoline ? s fantastic uniformity means one is as good as another . Water doesn ? t mix with gas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t even have to worry about buying substandard gasoline . And all traces of where the fuel came from are completely erased by the time it gets to a gas pump . Texaco gasoline is no longer from Texas , and gas from Unocal is not from " Cal . " Both companies have been purchased by Chevron , anyway . If gasoline were coffee , we might believe the Baku blend offered a fast but mellow ride . // As if acknowledging the futility of trying to stand out from the pack when 168,987 gas stations are selling essentially an identical chemical mix , stations have adopted a clannish ugliness . Whether they ? re in Fairbanks , Alaska , or Pine Island , Florida , they all subscribe to the familiar topography of canopied islands , cheerful plate glass , struggling hedges , and " Smile . You ? re being watched by a surveillance camera " signs . Predictable they are , to the very last 9/10ths of a cent , which is permanently printed on every last gas price sign in the land . // The gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its windows , pumps , and hedges are clues to the true nature of the American bargain with gasoline and the enigma of its role in the world . // On the counter in front of B. J. stands a line of purple plastic wizards , stomachs filled with green candy pebbles . Their shiny eyes stare at me expectantly . // At the periphery of my vision , a van enters Twin Peaks yard and parks near the fence . In the time it takes the door to slam , B. J. grows a foot taller , loses his paunch , and becomes a man of action . He snaps the countertop open , bounces into the yard , and lands in front of the van driver in one tigerlike swoop . Words are exchanged . The driver sulkily returns to his van and B. J. returns to the store , shaking his head . People try to ditch their cars in the station and take the bus , he explains , taking his position behind the wizards . " The customer is always right , " says B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Like vapors , bad people always seem to be wafting through the gas station . Last week B. J. ran out to stop a truck that was barreling toward the station ? s lighted canopy . The truck driver ignored him and crunched the canopy . Cars have driven willy nilly through the hedges as he watched . Nightly , people break through the chains on the four entrances . Once he found a gun in the hedge , stashed by a kid on the way to juvenile court . His response ? Shave the hedges . Every morning he cleans up garbage , cans , and bottles filled with things we won ? t discuss . Daily , and constantly , people try to steal : window squeegees , sodas , condoms , money , and phone calls . Behind B. J. ? s head are the counterfeit $20 bills the station has intercepted . // People use elaborate schemes to steal gas , he explains . Sometimes they ? ll pay for $5 and shut the pump off when it reaches $4.75 . Then they return to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knowing that the pumps don ? t turn off after dispensing amounts less than a dollar . Then they fill their tank and drive off . Others play on the sympathies of the attendant or accuse him of trying to cheat them . In stations where people pump before they pay , they often just drive off . The average gas station loses more than $2,141 a year to gasoline theft . Some lose much more . // Think of a gas station as a crime scene before the fact , and you ? ll start to appreciate it as a maze engineered for belligerent rats . Hedges , which I ? d interpreted as a pathetic attempt at dignity and baronial pretensions , actually eliminate escape routes for would-be robbers , limiting holdups . Many convenience stores buy " target hardening " kits , which include decals imprinted with rulers so that clerks can tell the police how tall the robbers were , two stickers that say " No 20s , no 50s , " two " Thank You " decals , and one " Smile . You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , crime is always evolving . " After we did target hardening in stores in the 1980s , the crime moved to the pumps  --  carjackings and abductions , " says Dr. Rosemary Erickson , a sociologist who ? s studied gas station crime for thirty years . " Now it ? s public nuisance crimes in the parking lots . Gas stations are considered a magnet . " ( 2 ) Nearly nine percent of U.S. robberies happen in gas stations and convenience stores , and the average gas station lost $1,749 to robbery in 2004. // Some of the crimes are not about money at all ; they ? re about freefloating anger . When gas prices are high , more people get " pump rage " and try to drive off without paying for gas . The Indian and Pakistani immigrants who own and staff many stations bear the brunt . After 9/11 , people who were angry at some vague combination of OPEC and Osama bin Laden attacked a hundred clerks at 7-Eleven gas stations and convenience stores in a month . Five men were killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bin Laden in a 7-Eleven uniform circulated on the Internet . The National Association of Convenience Stores issued a list of tips to discourage customers from attacking employees  --  including posting flags near the cash register . // In this harsh microclimate , B. J. maintains an impartial vigilance . When a woman enters and asks to use the phone , he activates the indifferent stupor , gesturing vaguely in the direction of a pay phone . // In a less charitable person , working in a gas station would have long ago brought on moral exhaustion and cynicism , but B. J. has created a worldview that embraces the station . " Everything is in the gas station , " he says . " Good people and bad people are here . Not many honest people . " Spending mornings with B. J. gives me time to reconsider the extreme disinterest I ? ve noticed in convenience store clerks over the years . B. J. is clearly operating the selective stupor on a very high level  --  perhaps as a watchful hibernation , or a trancelike sensitivity to the station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art of being aware of the bad people going round without letting on that he ? s awake . // A man comes in carrying a tiny dog and asking for M&amp;M ? s ; B. J. gives him a big grin . // A woman asks for the restroom . B. J. waves noncommitally at the sign , " No Restroom , " and the woman pixillates back into the fog . When a gnarled old man with a froth of white hair and huge yellow shooting glasses hands him a $10 bill , B. J. says gently , " Hello , my friend , how are you ? " // However harsh the gas station microclimate is , it ? s also a neighborhood for anyone who wants one . One industry focus group was surprised to find that customers had " deep feelings " for clerks . " Convenience store clerks are at the bottom of the retail ladder , " says Jay Gordon of industry publication C-Store Decisions , " but that ? s not how people perceive them . One woman described her local clerk as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions , napkins , and keeping things moving . Superhuman . " // One morning B. J. talks about how he left his family ? s farm in India in 1984 . His family feared he ? d be persecuted because he was Sikh , and the family ? s oldest son , so he left the country . He went first to Singapore , then Malaysia , Australia , New Zealand , Canada , and finally New Jersey , where he worked in a relative ? s gas station . His English is haphazard . " New Jersey . My skin no like cold . Look ugly . My ears turn black . " He grins at his ghoulishness . " I pack up me money and I come here . " California . His family has joined him here . His daughter is a nurse , his son an X-ray technician , and his son-in-law an engineer who ? s getting his MBA . Back in India , his younger brother runs the farm . B. J. has a theory about gas stations and life in general : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am bad all people look bad . I am nice and I have nice kids . If I am bad they will steal ? " He explains this to me a few times until it takes on the attributes of a philosophy . // The customers keep coming . They buy energy drinks and power bars and candy and Visine : Everyone spends time in front of the coolers , which are called " the vault . " The name properly recognizes both their position in the store  --  always opposite the door  --  and their role in bringing in a high percentage of the store ? s profits . // Snapple is advertising a drink involving bananas . The decal on the cooler says " Release Your Inner Chimp . " I look at the stream of distracted people coming into the store and wonder how many of them are attracted by the faux naughtiness implied by " Corn Gone Wrong " and " Release Your Inner Chimp . " Why is it that the coolly rational customers who shop ruthlessly for the cheapest gas turn into formless emotional mush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  when they enter the convenience store ? // " I make more money selling water than gas , " says owner Michael Gharib . " And the gas gets shipped around the world and goes through a refinery and still my customers want it cheap . " Wearing a pressed pinkstriped Ralph Lauren shirt , Gharib arrives at the station ready to spread his sense of order , compulsively arranging the mints as he talks about the twenty years he ? s owned the place . When he started he made his money selling gas with a profit margin of 10 cents a gallon , but as gas margins have fallen , he uses the store ? s 25 percent margin to boost the overall business . He moves on to dust the Daffy Duck Pez dispensers , straightens the STP carb cleaner , and leaves the dusty Fritos in a cup alone on the bottom shelf . Onward to the Skittles ! Gharib has the shoulders of a weight lifter , and big , liquid brown eyes . When he ? s in the store it seems suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straightens them . As I watch him , it dawns on me that the thing I ? ve thought of as a gas station for the past twenty years is actually more of a Skittles emporium that sells gasoline . // The candy wizards , for example , contain about 50 cents profit . To make that 50 cents selling gasoline , the store would have to sell 10 gallons of gas . ( And presumably the wizards are not combustible . ) Nationally , sunglasses have a 100 percent markup , ice is 60 percent , candy is 43 , and cigarettes are 19 . Gasoline ? s profitability has been falling over the past few years , reaching just 7 percent in 2004 , the lowest in twenty years . It seems that the more ruthlessly we shop for the cheapest gasoline , the more vulnerable we are to the likes of Corn Gone Wrong : Impulse buys make up three-quarters of the $132 billion spent in convenience stores . The gigantic economy of oil marketing comes to one ironic point : Selling gasoline in America requires the assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough business : One in six gas stations has closed in the last ten years . Gharib has a competitive edge , an attention to the details and balance sheets that has stood him well . // In the early 1980s Mobil owned the station . Gharib , a mechanic , leased it from the company . He had to sell Mobil brand gas but he got a guaranteed profit of 10 cents a gallon , and he ran the garage as a business . He never had to worry about gas prices , maintaining the pumps , or whether the tanks under the station met the latest code . A phone call to Mobil took care of virtually everything . In return , Mobil , like other brands , depended on men like Gharib , who had relationships with their customers , and their cars , to draw in business and sell more gas . Gharib , who was born in Iran and is fluent in American culture , was probably a good draw  --  he ? s friendly , warm , and shrewd . Let me put it this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the business of selling gas changed . Mobil stopped spending money to keep up the site and then sold it to another brand , which also didn ? t put much money in . In the early 1990s the station had just two old pumps . " The brand didn ? t see the money in this location , " says Gharib , " but being here ten years I knew the potential  --  it ? s convenient , and half the customers have been coming here for years and years . Firemen , police . Middle class . " // Gharib swung a deal to buy the station , remodeled it , and named it Twin Peaks to make it part of the neighborhood . ( He and his wife designed the logo on their honeymoon in Fiji . " There was nothing to do but sit on the beach and scuba dive , " he says . And think about gas stations . ) He reopened it as an independent , selling unbranded gasoline at discount rates . As the market got tougher , he added the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanic . //
