// When the alarm rang at six a.m. , Cassie leaped out of bed and ran to the bench outside the downstairs bathroom . Unfortunately , her sister Laura had already beaten her to it . " First dibs , " Laura told Cassie . Cassie sighed . " I know . " When you 're one of seven kids , it 's impossible to talk to Mom in private . That was what the bench was for . Whoever got there first had first dibs on talking to Mom  --  through the bathroom door-while she had her morning bath . The trick was getting to the bench before anyone else . On the way back to her room , Cassie was nearly run over by her brother Anthony . " Somebody 's on the bench already ? " he asked . " Yeah . Laura . " " Aw , man ! She 's always there , " Anthony groaned . Laura was fifteen and always had some dumb boyfriend crisis . Cassie , on the other hand , had a real problem . Her problem was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked on her . Sometimes Cassie fought back . Other times she ignored him . But it did n't seem to matter what she did . He kept bothering her . Mom would know what to do about Erik ... if Cassie ever got a chance to talk to her . The next morning Marc was on the bench . Marc was seventeen . He was the oldest . He had dated the same girl for three years  --  unlike Laura , who changed boyfriends as often as she changed clothes . Cassie could n't imagine what problem Marc could have . And she certainly would n't find out , because Marc threatened to tie her legs like a pretzel if she did n't get lost . On Thursday morning , five-year-old Liz was on the bench . She complained about how unfair it was that she had to share her room with baby Andrew . " He makes my room smell bad , and he chews on Barbie , " she whined . Cassie listened impatiently from around the corner . She could have told Liz what to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your nose whenever he has a diaper change , she would have said . Cassie sighed . By the time I get to the bench first , I 'll be in college and wo n't have to worry about Erik , she thought . By Friday , Cassie was tired from getting up extra-early all week . When she saw somebody on the bench-again-she almost turned around without even looking . But out of the corner of her eye she saw who it was . Mom ! " What are you doing on the bench ? " Cassie cried . // Her mother smiled . " Is n't this the place to sit when you 've got a problem ? " Cassie laughed . " Not for you . This is our bench . " Mom 's smile disappeared . " Sometimes mothers have problems , too , " she said . Mothers are supposed to solve problems , Cassie thought . They are n't supposed to have problems . Cassie ran back up the stairs to her room . She shook her sister Amy awake . " Guess who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amy rolled over and pulled the pillow over her head . " Who cares ? " she mumbled . " Mom is on the bench ! " Amy poked her head out from under the pillow . " She is ? " " Come see , " Cassie said . The girls tiptoed down the first flight of stairs and peered around the corner . Mom was still on the bench , sitting like a lady in church , with her hands folded in her lap . " What should we do ? " Amy whispered . " I think we should get everybody together and go find out what 's going on , " Cassie said . Cassie woke Laura , Marc , and Dad . Amy woke Anthony and Liz . They left the baby sleeping , and trooped slowly down the stairs . " What 's going on , Jackie ? " Dad asked Mom . " I 'm sitting here because I have a problem that I 'm hoping you can all help me with , " Mom said . " I 'm so busy cooking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting up with hungry babies that I do n't have any time for myself . The only time I get for myself is when I have my morning bath . But lately there 's been somebody sitting on this bench every single morning shouting another problem to me . " " Well , it 's the only time anybody can talk to you when your mind is n't on something else , " Laura said . " And it 's private because everybody else is either sleeping or getting ready for school , " Amy added . // " And everybody knows that the first person on the bench gets first dibs , " Anthony put in . " The only problem is , somebody else always gets there first , " Cassie grumbled . " No , that 's not the only problem , " Mom said . " The other problem is that I need a few minutes to myself to start the day . Can anybody think of a solution ? " Everybody started talking at once . " If Laura would just get rid of all her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your girlfriend ? " Laura asked . " Why do n't you get rid of her ? " " Now there 's an idea , " Anthony said . " I say we get rid of all girls . Who needs " em ? Yesterday I shot a spitball at this girl in my class and she told on me ! Can you believe it ? " " What do you expect ? " Cassie asked , with her hands on her hips . " This boy in my class does the same thing to me . It 's obnoxious ! " " Why ? " Anthony asked . " He 's just letting you know he likes you . " " By getting my hair all full of spitballs ? " Cassie shrieked . She was about to tell her brother a few things about girls when his words sunk in-Erik liked her ? Now she really had to talk to Mom . But Mom was gone . The bathroom door was closed and Cassie could hear water running . " Hey ! Mom 's having her bath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounded on the door . " I thought you wanted to talk , Jackie ! " he shouted . " All I want is a quiet bath ! " Mom shouted back . " It 's the rest of you who want to talk . So go ahead . You 're not bothering me . " Marc and Laura continued their conversation as they trudged up the stairs . Dad , Amy , and Liz went into the kitchen to start breakfast . Anthony sat down on the bench and motioned to Cassie to join him . " A guy ca n't just come right out and tell a girl he likes her , " Anthony said . " Why not ? " Cassie asked . " Because ! " " Well , if you want the girl to like you back , you 'd better learn to tell her , " Cassie said . " No girl likes to get covered with spitballs . " " And no guy likes to get yelled at or laughed at just because he likes a girl , " Anthony replied . That actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being nice to Erik , just to see what happened . She looked at her brother with new respect . Who 'd have thought he 'd know so much about boys ? // <p>
