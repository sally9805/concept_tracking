With " Maze of Trees " ( Aug. 2005 ) and this new story , Claudia O'Keefe makes us wonder if her years of living in West Virginia were all just research . This new tale is a timely and harrowing vision that has some of the same frightening power to it that Ward Moore 's " Lot " probably had in 1953 : this could well be how it goes down . Ms. O'Keefe lives in New Mexico these days , where she works with the Institute for Space and Nuclear Power at the University of New Mexico . <p> FELICE COULD NEVER REMEMBER who the man was five minutes after he left . She could neither tell you his name nor describe his face . Was he tall or short ? Fat or thin ? Muscular or soft ? What type of clothes did he wear ? What were his politics ? Or could he not care less what they did in Washington these days ? They talked . That much she knew . Each time he visited her crappy little log cabin outside Cherry Lick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked for hours . He also preferred to visit her outside . He was adamant about it , always refusing her invitation to come indoors , one of the few memories it seemed she could keep . In the late spring , they sat on limestone boulders that ruined the pasture behind the cabin as a potential gardening space , misaligned gray rocks that erupted through the March violets and wild onions like impacted wisdom teeth . When summers came , she hauled out her pair of five-dollar camp chairs and they anchored them side by side in swells of waving grass , all the while trying to ignore the flies and stench of cow dung that wafted over her landlord 's property . They stood sheltered under the bare , wet-black branches of her sugar maple in the fall , her boot toe trying unsuccessfully to push aside layer upon layer of sodden leaves to find bare ground where she could scratch a note to herself about him , just one word . Even in winter he made her stand out on her ice-slimed back porch while they conversed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that when she found herself inside at last , with no recollection of coming in to warm her hands over her stove 's only working coil , her fingers were white and bloodless from the tips down to the palms . Each time she witnessed his arrival on the sloping gravel drive , she told herself that this time she would remember . She would save his name somewhere in her head , some place safe he could n't pilfer . She 'd paint the shape of his hands on the insides of her eyelids , sketch his eyes on her palm with one of her daughter 's felt markers , like a student trying to crib a test . Twice she found her clues , within minutes of his departure , but they were useless , as if she 'd scribbled them while asleep and dreaming in that language that makes no sense upon waking . Her depiction of his eyes was equally baffling and disturbing . She 'd drawn a pair of whirlpools , violent , watery tornadoes flying across her life and heart lines . Felice had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One , he was kind sometimes . Two , a vein of cruelty ran through him darker and thicker than in the richest Appalachian coal mine . " Are you in trouble , Mom ? " her daughter Risa asked one afternoon when Felice picked her up after school . " What ? " Felice said . Looking at her daughter in the rearview mirror , she was unable to conceal her startled reaction . Risa sat in the back seat next to her friend , Sheila , to whom they were giving a ride home . Light filtered out of the dull September sky like sun through old sheet plastic . It cast yellow reflections at the port wine stain on Risa 's otherwise delicate left cheek , turning the birthmark orange . A little more than three months remained until Risa 's thirteenth birthday . Though shades of gray emotion often eluded her daughter , as was to be expected with someone her age , she was highly intuitive about moods both black and deliriously bright coloring the world around her . She picked up on them immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of strangers . " No , honey . " Felice laughed . " I 'm fine . " She had no intention of telling Risa she sat behind the wheel in total dread because she 'd run over a wooly-bear caterpillar on the drive here . Not just one caterpillar , but hundreds . Thousands of them . All crossing Hwy 382 going in the same direction , from west to east . For some reason it had made her think of her odd visitor and want to scream mindlessly . Now , pulling out of the school parking lot and turning north again , she realized she 'd have to drive over the bizarre phenomenon all over again . Laboring up the road , the car crested the hill that marked the edge of the town where Risa went to junior high and the beginning of their fifty-minute drive back to Cherry Lick . Felice 's foot hesitated on the gas pedal when confronted by the stain along the asphalt below , spreading clear to the first bend in the highway , black and inky red and creamy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frowned . " What is that ? " " Woolies , " Felice said . Unable to avoid them , her tires crushed the first wave of worms , fat as a little girl 's pinky , but covered in fur as dense and appealing as a teddy bear 's . " Oh , God , yuck ! " Sheila said , her face and hands pressed up against the window on her side of the car . Sheila had refused to wear her seat belt and now Felice worried about the girl , who was her responsibility , somehow opening the door and falling out . She heard Risa unbuckle herself . Her daughter grabbed the front passenger 's side seat and pulled her upper body over it to better see through the windshield . " Sit back , " Felice warned them both . " Both of you buckle your seat belts . That 's the last time I 'm going to ask , Sheila . " Both girls ignored her . Her fingers clutched the wheel so hard her knuckles ached . " Go around them , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dead , covered the road from one side to the other . A pickup truck skidded around the first curve , sliding on the remains of previously smashed caterpillars , while its tires threw up a spray of the newly crushed behind them , splattering their car 's passenger window . Sheila jumped back reflexively , giggling in delighted fright . " Stop , Mom . " Felice , wishing she could , did not apply the brake . " Stop killing them , Mom ! " Risa was frantic , her lips twisted and blotchy from biting down on them as she watched . " I 'm sorry , Risa . " This was their only route home , over miles and miles of the gentle creatures , whom Risa liked to pick up and cuddle in her hand each time she found one . " I 'm sorry . " An hour and a half later , drained and still upset , Felice dropped down on her daughter 's bed and hugged the girl tightly . Risa resisted at first , but then finally relaxed in her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all black ? " Risa asked . " Yes . " " Do you know what that means ? " Wooly-bear caterpillars normally had black at both ends and a red-dish-brown striped midsection . Folklore dictated that the narrower the brown stripe , the harsher the winter . Not one of the woolies whose lives she 'd just extinguished had even had a brown stripe . Her fingers pushed Risa 's tousled hair out of her face , gently untangling the knots in it without feeling herself doing so . Her eyes grew unfocused . For a split second it felt as if her body was elsewhere . Felice rocked in a bitter spring breeze , arms around her knees , drawn up on one of the boulders in the back pasture . She saw a man 's hands . Strong , long-fingered , cleanly kept . Hands that blurred just a little as they moved , deft and never to be questioned . Hands of warning . " Winter 's finally coming , " Felice said . " It comes from west to east , taking as many as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes , " the girl agreed softly , not even questioning the ridiculous thing her mother had just said . Felice and Risa shared their dingy nineteenth-century cabin with Felice 's mother , Karena . Both Felice and Karena had fallen on hard times financially during the late 1990s , so it was agreed that they would join together as a semi-extended family . They 'd moved to the Virginia-West Virginia border from the Tucson area four years earlier , pushed out by the real estate boom that took everything beyond Section 8 housing out of their reach . Very few places in the U.S. remained unaffected by double-digit gains in housing prices at that time . Cherry Lick was one of them . Karena hated the place . She hated that the nearest city with a bookstore was almost three hours away . She could n't stand the winters , which she claimed lasted fourteen months of the year . In cold weather she complained loudly and often about the missing chinking between the cabin 's heavy log walls , fallen out years ago and never replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit left him in a permanent fugue state . She told Felice that she missed her turquoise skies and tacky billboards with long-legged cowboys in neon cowboy hats selling " authentic Indian souvenirs " made in Pakistan . Of all the things that drove her mother nuts , however , Felice knew she resented the Fundies here the most . Born and raised a firm believer in religious exploration vs. religious dogma , Karena felt herself drowning in a population who interpreted the Bible literally and supported what she saw as Washington 's desire to conquer the Middle East in the name of Christ . " Is this the twelfth century ? " she 'd ask . " Are we living through the Crusades ? " Felice could n't say what made her decide on Cherry Lick . It was n't their sort of town . Outsiders were always outsiders here , each of the families who surrounded their rented home having been on this land since before the two Virginias were separate states . She had to admit that the fervent pursuit of a Christian life dominated her neighbors " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sex , though it happened as readily here as any place else , was given a crust of sin too difficult to discard . She could go months without hearing someone make a joke that did n't begin or end with the words , " time to come to Jesus . " Curiously , she could n't remember what her own religious leanings were , be they one of the many flavors of Christianity , anti-Christian , or outside that debate entirely . She felt fairly confident that she was n't into Judaism , Hinduism , or the Muslim tradition , simply because she had n't been raised as such . She knew she had once had very definite opinions about the order of the universe , but somewhere along the line a hole had appeared in her mind and into it those opinions plunged , never to be resurrected . Instead of trying to remember what her beliefs were , she fought to remember when and where she 'd lost them . She thought it may have occurred slightly before she had packed her family into the car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fled him . Not that it had done any good . He 'd found her immediately , been waiting the day they moved in . Rather than dwell on the downsides of her current home , Felice preferred the positives . Spring was glorious here , mostly because it followed winter . She did n't mind using a flashlight to navigate the living room , which sucked all the light out of the house even on the sunniest of days . Nor did the hundreds of thousands of spiders thriving in the cabin 's crumbling timbers frighten her . She could flick them away when they crawled over her in the night . Cherry Lick 's social isolation did n't bother Felice . She knew she had sought it out . She definitely did n't belong here , but then she 'd never really belonged anywhere , even in her home town of Los Pios . Rather than feeling straitjacketed by this area 's religious proclivities , she felt comforted living amongst people who let someone else tell them what was what when it came to spiritual matters . Rules were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued into October , with its harvest festivals and corn mazes , Day-Glo green plastic pumpkins giving way at the megacenter to an avalanche of resin Christmas trinkets before Halloween , while Risa underwent daily tweenie emergencies , discovering Sheila doing the dirty behind the FFA pig barn with the twelve-year-old hunk over whom she herself mooned , and Karena hid in her bedroom with a 2.5 liter bottle of Carlo Rossi Mountain Red , watching late night reruns of Hardball , Meet the Press , and The Capital Gang , Felice paced . She walked . She dreaded . She knew . She slogged through lakes of cow pies out back day after day , knowing her family had only a little while to go now . Just days until life changed and could n't change back . In the early morning hours of November 11th , Felice lay in a hypnagogic state , at the far threshold of sleep , the night 's dreaming done . Or so she thought . Though she 'd recently taken to sleeping with the three-way light bulb in her bedside lamp turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its mastery over her part of the world still unchallenged . Cobwebby frost lay over the pasture outside , paralyzing every growing thing , from the bent and rotted stems of summer 's thistles to the copperheads that shut their eyes and felt themselves harden into knots , stored beneath the icy ground like so much frozen chicken . She dreamt the type of dream that feels like real life , and in it her three-way bulb glowed darkroom red . Her sheets , damp with sweat , pooled around her , a slurry of blood pouring over bare legs . Above her dresser , the tiny , frameless mirror she 'd found at a yard sale blinked crimson , reflecting an ambulance 's revolving lights as they shone in through the window . " What is it ? What 's happened ? " she sat up and demanded . Her mother stood at the foot of her bed . She was transparent . She looked happy and young , dressed in a suede mini-skirt and fringed leather vest from the early seventies , her hair an amber beehive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Felice thought . She 's dead . Her ghost was here to say good-bye . " Mom ? " " I loved Arizona , " Karena said . " I loved where I grew up . T-bird convertibles and sunburn . The red rocks of Sedona . Why did we have to leave ? " Felice did n't know what to say to this . " Something awful has happened , " Karena announced , then disappeared . Felice opened her eyes , now truly awake . Her pulse coursed through the blood vessels in her ears , sounding like floodwaters trashing through a cave . Her lungs expanded painfully as she gasped in surprise . Her mother was n't dead . She sat watching Felice from the little chair by the window , looking every one of her sixty-six years . Her shoulders drooped , her cheeks were flush with an unhealthy excitement , her eyes completely resigned . " God , you scared me , " Felice said . She told herself to calm down , breathe more slowly . She figured it must be close to three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mom ? Ca n't you sleep ? " " I think .... " Karena was uncertain . " You should come see CNN . " THE PLAGUE HAD BEGUN . World Health Organization experts figured the virus entered the U.S. in Seattle , on a jet from Indonesia carrying 435 of the first 500 to die . Only a small percentage of the passengers lived in the Puget Sound area or terminated their travel there . Of the 362 travelers who switched planes at SeaTac , the majority continued on to Chicago , Denver , and Tampa , but a single couple , whose final destination was Dayton , Ohio , proved potent enough as carriers of the disease to fell the passenger lists of three additional flights , each full to capacity . Seventy-two percent of those infected died within a week . Dubbed the Tsunami Flu because it appeared to originate on a small , remote island flattened by the 2004 disaster , the pandemic confounded epidemiologists who decided early on that they were dealing with a brand new cousin to A(H5N1) , better known as the avian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world was not dealing with bird flu , theories multiplied , among them that the waves devastating the island nation had set in motion a series of events that took years to unfold . Some said the Tsunami Flu had been around for nearly a century , but isolated until the waters made the tiny speck of rock in the Indian Ocean where it lay dormant unlivable , thus forcing survivors to migrate to larger population centers and carry the virus with them . Others contended that a certain animal species , perhaps wild pigs , weakened by the disaster and the destruction of their natural habitat , were transported on floating wreckage to unsuitable ecosystems where a previously low-grade strain of flu was encouraged to mutate into something fatal , then spread to humans . Felice did n't care . She cared only that the virus came on fast and hard , the mortality rate highest among those younger than eight and over sixty years of age . It incubated and was infectious for far longer than the average flu , but severe symptoms did n't appear until the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and killed patients within hours . Officials had kept news of the virus under wraps for nine days , badly underestimating how quickly and completely it was able to mushroom . When CNN first broke the story , the media had no idea what was going on , only that hundreds of people had succumbed overnight to a mystery ailment that appeared without warning in several major metropolitan areas . People collapsed in dressing rooms at the mall , while hailing taxis , repairing downed power lines , or cruising up to the take-out window for a triple-decker combo . Karena hugged her parka around her shoulders as she and Felice sat on the edge of Karena 's bed , three feet from the TV . Outside , the temperature dropped into the teens . They did n't have enough blankets in the house . Felice noticed her mother shivering under the parka , but did n't feel the cold herself . Hypnotized by LIVE shots of ambulances backed up at emergency rooms , she watched frustrated EMTs waiting to unload their cargo , like limos mobbing the Kodak Theatre on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry her comatose teenage daughter into a trauma ward unaided played over and over in a continuous loop . Felice and her mother glanced up nervously at the ceiling . Risa slept in the room above . " We 're safe here , " Felice said , more to convince herself than her mother . " You think ? " Karena asked sarcastically . " I do n't believe that for a second . " " Mom , there 's a reason this place is the butt of every late night comedian 's jokes . Cherry Lick did n't even have electricity until the sixties . We 're lucky our telephone is n't on a party line . Risa told me her friends " kindergarten memories are of picking up the phone and listening in on their neighbors " conversations . We 're forgotten back here , isolated . " " We have an interstate and a Wal-Mart . That 's all this thing needs . " " The store ! " Felice jumped to her feet , reached for her boots . " I should take what we have left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And get yourself killed by terrified mobs ? " Karena reached out and gripped Felice 's wrist , fingernails biting into it . " There are n't going to be any terrified mobs , " Felice said . " Not yet . If anyone 's awake right now they 're either watching wrestling reruns or the Weather Channel . No one is calling this a plague yet . I doubt the locals are bright enough to look at people dying five states away and think they could be next . " Her mother let go of Felice 's arm and sighed deeply . " You know what 's right . Go ahead if you think you have to . " " Would you rather starve two weeks from now ? " Karena 's features hardened with suppressed anger and familiar fear , the fear that something would happen to Felice , leaving her alone . " You do n't talk with the old farts at the post office like I do . If they are n't trying to drag you to a tent revival , they 're retelling their family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The Spanish Flu . " Karena saw her daughter 's blank look and snorted in frustration . " Killed fifty million worldwide , more than the bubonic plague ? How many people in the city know about the pandemic of 1918 ? Hardly any . So little happens of consequence around here that what memories people do have become concentrated . Thousands died in these mountains . They remember it like it was yesterday . " " Which is why I should go now . While I still can . " " Fine . Go . " " Mom ? Grandma ? " Arms hugged to her chest from the chill , Risa stood in the doorway . Her slippers scuffed the old pine floor with each step as she headed toward the bed . " What are you fighting about ? " " I 'm sorry we woke you , sweetie , " Felice said . " We 're not arguing , sweet pea , " Karena assured her . " We have some breaking information , " said a voice from the television set . All three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top anchor . Disheveled after twelve hours on camera without a break , he looked little better than the unfortunates being hauled out of Denver 's ambulances . " This just in . The CDC has confirmed the itinerary of Val and Judy Piets , the couple whose domestic flight from Seattle to their home in Dayton , Ohio , included connecting flights in Chicago and two other cities . CNN is being told that their two other stops were at Louisville , Kentucky , and Charleston , West Virginia . No word yet on whether the couple disembarked for any length of time at either of those airports . As soon as we have that information .... " Felice sat down on the bed again , pulled Risa into her lap and crushed her protectively to her . " We may already have it , " Karena said . Felice 's stomach soured . " I do n't think so . Not yet . I 've got to go get us what we 're going to need . " She sent Risa back up to bed . She rose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood waiting for her by the car . An hour after sunrise the phone rang . Fighting a mental fog that left her uncertain what she 'd been doing moments before , Felice drifted into the kitchen to catch the call before the answering machine picked up . Risa sat calmly with one of their whitewashed flea market chairs faced away from the center of the room , staring through the multi-paned glass door to the back porch and watching something disappear into the woods . Her morning bowl of mini-wheats rested and wobbled on her legs , milk dripping unnoticed onto her pajamas . Felice grabbed the receiver , while at the same time trying to see what mesmerized her daughter . Herds of deer were an everyday occurrence , flocks of wild turkeys less common . Rarely , they glimpsed the flame-red tail of a fox shooting by , or the monstrous , glorious form of a pileated woodpecker . A black smudge , taller than it was wide , blighted the pasture , shrinking in size by the second as it traveled farther away . It bobbed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Felice could n't make out a head , arms , or legs . It was a shadow , walking like a human . Her breath sped up frantically as she prayed for the forest to hurry and swallow up the dark , smutty thing . " Hello ? " Felice said into the phone . " Is this Risa 's mom ? " asked an unfamiliar voice . Risa turned to look at Felice . Tears ran unhindered down her daughter 's cheeks , the sides of her nose , around her mouth . Wetted by them , her birthmark darkened , the color grew more vivid , as if varnished . " Mom ? " Not vacillating for a second , Felice dropped the phone . " Just a minute , " she said absently to the caller , but the receiver had already banged to the floor . " Risa , what is it ? Did you see it ? What was that ? Did it scare you ? " Risa , clinging to her mother , refused to speak . Frowning , Felice gently pried herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she apologized . " Who is this ? " " This Risa 's mom ? " " Yes . " " I 'm Darla Heiney . Sheila Heiney 's mom . " " Yes , of course . " " I 'm guessin " you know by now about the plague . " The woman was terse , matter of fact . " They have n't labeled it - " Darla Heiney rolled right over that . " We are n't waiting for them to close the schools . We 're sending our children to safety . " " We ? Sending them where ? " " The parents here , Cherry Lick . Jerry the bus driver 's calling in sick and taking a load up to the old schoolhouse on Muddy Stump Mountain while they 're still healthy . Peg ' 11 look after them . " " Peg who ? " " Old school nurse , she and her boys has a camp next to the schoolhouse . " " How do we know they are n't infected ? " Darla 's dull laugh sounded like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know much about us , do you ? Peg ai n't been off that mountain in years . Clyde and Hubert only come down to ride the Rattler at the state fair , and that was back in August . They do n't got it . " Felice 's heart convulsed at the thought of sending Risa away with these hicks . Could strangers be trusted to keep her warm enough ? Would they feed her anything remotely edible ? What happened if Risa became ill ? Felice wished she did n't have to go out into the world to make a living . She could simply keep her daughter home until the danger passed . Darla interrupted the silence between them as if guessing her thoughts . " Hon , " she said , " I do n't really care what you decide . It 's Sheila made me call . She 's worried about her friend . " Risa 's tears had evaporated , whatever she 'd seen through the back door thrust aside once she intuited adults were talking about her . " Mom - " she began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours old and already fading wormed their way back to the surface . Her car keys dangling from slack fingers , the emergency run into town now a non-issue . Not a whisper of light fell from the night sky , the new moon not yet exited her womb , clouds obscuring every star . Yet she saw him clearly , the back of his head as he walked away from her . Hair black as clotted blood , each glassy strand sharp enough to cut naked flesh . " Felice . " His voice crawled inside her ear on ticklish insect feet . She shuddered . " I want her , " he said . " Jerry will stop at the end of your drive an hour later than usual , " Darla said , bringing her back to the present . " He 'll wait two minutes . " " Yes , " Felice said . " We 'll be there . " WISPY , GOOSE-DOWN SNOW swirled about mother and daughter as they stood just the other side of the icy cattle guard separating their drive from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opening to their drive hidden by fir trees and wild hedgerows of leafless greenbrier . Anxious that the bus driver might not see them and opt not to stop , Felice felt a soothing touch and looked down to find Risa 's hand on her arm . " Jerry can see me from here . " " Okay , " Felice said . Pickup after pickup truck passed by , drivers nodding to them sadly . How many similar scenes had they witnessed along this road ? " God bless you , " an elderly farmer called to them as he cruised by , window rolled down despite the frigid temperature . Felice stroked her daughter 's hair . " You know I love you - " " - a whole big bunch , " Risa finished the habitual phrase for her . " I love you , too , Mom . " " I 'll come get you soon . I promise . We 'll get your favorite quadruple fudge brownie at the mall in Roanoke . We 'll get two of them , smash them together and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't laugh . Even as a baby , Risa had been gifted with a beautiful laugh , never a giggle , but melodious , uninhibited laughter that made the air shiver and clear . Felice remembered the last time she 'd heard it . When they still lived in Los Pinos . Unlike a toddler 's fierce attachment to her favorite blankey or a five-year-old 's innocent belief in Santa Claus , something in Felice told her those joyous sounds should not have been allowed to lapse . Her daughter 's beautiful laughter had been a language in itself . Her bilingual nature should not have been suppressed , even when the adults around her forced her to use only the tongue with which they felt comfortable . Felice would give her life to hear her daughter laugh like that right now . Jerry roared up the hill and around the sharp bend , his bus already overloaded with children . They sat dangerously high in seats piled with luggage . Backpacks and crates of food and an avalanche of sleeping bags filled the aisle . Spotting Risa and Felice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perches to the floor . " Sorry " bout that , " Jerry said , when he opened the door . His hand trembled on the wheel . He wore a sterile paper face mask . Perceiving Felice 's alarm , he pulled down the mask in order to speak more clearly . " Do n't worry . I ai n't got it . It 's made some of the parents feel more easy sending their kids off with me is all . " Felice nodded . She kissed Risa 's forehead and held her close . Jerry would have to pry her away if he expected Risa to get on the bus . " Ma'am , " he said . Felice gazed up at him . " Lots of kids to pick up . Lots more worried-sick parents . We 've got a long way to go . " Felice nodded again and released her child , righted the heavy , adultsized camping pack on Risa 's shoulders , and gave her a gentle nudge toward the bus . " Mom , guess what ! " Risa pivoted suddenly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character for this somber good-bye . " He spoke to me . " " What ? Who spoke to you , honey ? " Felice asked urgently . " What 's his name ? " Risa started to answer , but Jerry pushed the lever to close the bus 's hinged doors , putting glass and metal between them , and Felice could n't read lips . The bus rumbled away in an explosion of grinding gears , diesel smoke , and burning oil , leaving Felice standing precariously on the cattle guard , the life drained out of her the farther Risa rode from their drive . She felt fragile , old , less of a person . She wanted to scream , knew she could because no one lived close enough to hear her . Instead , she turned and headed back down the drive , quiet , eyes growing hot with held back tears , not knowing what came next . Sixteen hundred dead that evening . Twenty-three hundred by the next morning . Thirty-four thousand within two days . Two hundred and seventy-eight thousand by the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media began calling the married , ill-fated disease carriers from Ohio , had disembarked in Charleston . As Karena predicted , a WalMart trucker stopping at the Covington store in Virginia brought it to those living on the border . Though nothing happened for more than twelve days , on the thirteenth day , the first cases of the flu cropped up along the Alleghenies , reaching into every hollow within an hour of the Interstate . Nor was the trucker the only source of transmission , just the first of hundreds infected to bring death to the Mid-Atlantic . Rather than being safer , the Appalachian hills turned out to be one of the places with the highest per capita ratio of fatalities . Though those in high population centers had a greater chance of contracting the disease , after more than a million deaths in the U.S. it was thought the better , more readily available medical care in the cities gave victims an edge . Emergency production of medicines and an eventual vaccine would lead to a tapering off of deaths in the cities , the talking heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most rural areas , however , that same help would be slow arriving and more difficult to distribute . Events were cancelled and most public buildings closed . Felice 's boss called her and told her not to come in ; the office would be shut down until further notice . Days , then weeks went by without a single opportunity for Felice to speak with Risa . No phones , not even party lines , were installed atop Muddy Stump Mountain . Cell phone coverage was nonexistent more than a few miles from the Interstate . Who communicated with the old schoolhouse and how ? Felice wanted to know . Her sole link to her child was the surly Darla Heiney , hardly a font of information . " They 's not hacking or coughing or wheezing or anything like that , " Darla told her over the phone . " But have you heard anything about Risa ? " Felice asked . " Has your daughter said anything to you about her ? Is Risa scared ? Is she homesick ? Is she eating ? " " Hon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , how Felice had come to hate Darla 's " hon 's . " " They 's not talking to us at all right now with the Tsunami spreading so much . " " Can you send a message ? Can you get a message to her ? " " No ! " Darla bawled into the phone , drawing out the word in that peculiar mountain way that mimicked a heifer giving birth at the bottom of a sink hole . " I done told you that before . " " But I do n't even know where Muddy Stump Mountain is . No one will tell me and there are n't any maps of this area for sale . I 've never lived any place where you could n't buy a damn map ! " " You 're not thinking of trying to get up there , are you ? " Darla asked , " " cause the way things are right now , Clyde and Hubert will shoot you on sight if you get anywhere close , no questions asked . " " Are you telling me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? " Felice said . " That 's exactly what I 'm tellin " you . " " You ca n't stop me . " " Maybe not me , but Hubert 's twenty-gauge Mossberg sure can , " Darla said . " Felice , you 're just going to have to put your trust in the Lord till this thing 's over . Be strong in knowing that Jesus is looking out for her as we speak . " Apparently the savior was n't looking out for Darla Heiney . She died the next morning . Cut off from even this feeble source of news about Risa , Felice moved into full-panic mode . She called the school again , hoping someone might have been left behind to field questions after it closed its doors . Now not even the answering machine in the front office picked up . She found the bus driver listed in the phone book with his address and raced to his house next to a rarely visited Civil War battlefield . His front door stood open , the place deserted . A litter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tripped her up as she made her search of the home for clues to Risa 's whereabouts . Nothing . Nor had a crumb been left in the house for the dogs . After filling an old enamel roaster with fresh water for the animals , the best she could do , she moved on , pounding on door after neighbor 's door . No one answered . Cars sat in many of the drives , but she detected no movement in any of the houses . If the residents were home , they remained in hiding . She drove to the junior high . It proved a useless trip . A thick chain and industrial-sized lock put the place off limits . Officials had n't even left information at the gate . Her Chevette wound for hours along one-lane country roads , passing yard after yard of brown ice and toys forgotten in mid-play , but she saw no children . Her concern was n't that she 'd miss spotting the mountain schoolhouse amongst the leafless trees and hills so convoluted and covered in mud they were like dirty blankets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near madness was the unhelpful , unconcerned behavior of the people she did find to question . Judging by their accents they 'd lived here for years , if not their entire lives , yet none confessed to having heard of the old school . They listened to her frantic , gradually more strident story , and shrugged . Her gas gauge rode below " E " for more than twenty miles before she found a service station . Though it was only a little after three in the afternoon , dusk overpowered the winter-short day and blackened every hollow . Pulling up to the pump , she sighed in relief to see a light on inside . Digging into her purse for her wallet , she looked up , reached for the door handle , and found a shotgun barrel aimed at the spot between her eyes . " Do n't , ma'am , " said the station owner through the rolled-up car window . " I just want some gas and a cup of coffee , " she said . " No coffee . No food , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got new rules for the duration . " " All right . " " I 'm going back into the store . I 'm going to trust in the Lord that you is an honest person and will pay me for what gas you take . Leave the money inside that there tire over there . " He pointed at an old tire lying in the dirt next to the pump , filled with soil and the desiccated remains of last year 's hollyhocks . His gaze never left her as he backed into the store as if she were the one with gun about to pull the trigger . " Wait ! " she called after him . " Do you know where - " He shut his door quietly , yet firmly . Felice followed instructions , filled her tank , paid , and drove home . She did n't sleep that night , could n't stop twisting and turning various scenarios over and over again in her mind , each involving Risa sick or in trouble and calling out for Mommy , who would n't answer , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just let her go like that ! " Karena said to Felice 's back , as her daughter paced anxiously in the cave-like living room at dawn . Felice turned to see Karena enter from the kitchen . With the morning sun at her back , her hair half-wild from sleep , and resentment she 'd suppressed for days carving a look of fury into her features , her mother resembled a ship 's figurehead cutting through the gloom . Felice felt that anger plowing toward her and cringed with guilt . " How could you let them take her without knowing where they were going ? " she asked . " They did tell me where they were going . Muddy .... " Fear made it hard to focus . What am I going to dol How do I get her back ? I do n't have anyone to help me . I 'm alone . " Muddy Hump - " " Muddy Stump Mountain , " her mother said . " For God 's sake , you do n't even remember the name of the place , let alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother are you ? " " A terrified one . Okay ? I admit it , " Felice shouted . " I 'm absolutely terrified we 're never going to see Risa again . It was Jerry , the bus driver . It was the school bus that came to pick them up . Should n't you be able to trust a God-damned school bus ? How was I supposed to know these frickin " people were totally disorganized ? It was all happening so fast , the deaths , the thousands of deaths , the train wreck spread of this thing , the inevitability that it would come looking for us here . I figured everyone else was just as terrified as me . Jerry would rush our children off to safety and then be in touch with us immediately to let us know they were safe and what was happening to them . I do n't understand the people in this place . I 've tried to figure them out , what goes through their heads , but I do n't get it . It 's like they care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children , but they do n't care . They 're like Darla Heiney , shrugging it off their backs and then dropping dead . " Felice felt as if she were physically coming apart . A thousand horrible emotions flooded through her , tumbling her about inside herself , dragging her under like an invisible riptide . " I was afraid for her when I sent her off , " she said . " That 's why I did it . I was afraid he 'd get her . " " He ? Who are you talking about ? " " The man , the person who 's always visiting us . " " What man ? Felice .... " Her mother reached out to her . " Do you have a fever ? " Felice pushed her mother 's hand aside before she could lay it against her forehead . " Do n't touch me . " " Why , are you sick ? " " Yes . " Did she imagine it , or did her mother hesitate , retreat a step in selfpreservation ? A moment later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely human reaction . Saw and forgave . " Sick with worry , " Felice said . " I 'm sorry , " Karena said , softening her attitude . " I know you were just trying to protect Risa . I 'm worried , too . " " Mom , I do n't know what to do . " " We go look for her , is what . " " What do you think I did all of yesterday ? " " But you did n't have my connections . " Felice frowned . Had her mother been out where she could catch the flu ? " What connections ? " " There 's this old geezer at the post office . He hovers inside the door almost all day long . Now that they 've discontinued counter service and the postmaster is no longer there , he does n't have anyone to talk to . His mind is half-gone , but there 's enough left that he recognizes me every day and keeps hitting on me . I 'll ask him where they 've taken Risa . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say - " " He 's still got fingers , " Karena said . " He can point . " Hope , a small sliver of it , pushed through Felice 's monologue of inner dread . " I do n't want you getting too close to him . Even yesterday . I did my best to stand a few feet away from people . " She thought of the gas station owner . " Not that they would let me come near . " " Do n't worry about me . Our biggest problem is what to do once we find the schoolhouse . " " What do you mean ? " Felice asked . " They 're armed , are n't they ? " Felice thought for a minute , pacing again . " I wish I had a bullhorn . " " Signs , " her mother said . " Big signs ! " Felice agreed . " We wo n't drive up directly to the schoolhouse . We 'll get just close enough for them to read our signs . " " Does n't Risa have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother . " I 'll get busy making them . You drive down to the post office and talk to this guy . " Karena grabbed the car keys . " Remember , do n't get too close , " Felice said . She went to work , thankful her mother forgot to question her about the visitor . She regretted having blurted out what she did . It was as if by telling another person about him , it made him more than figment , gave him a life she dared not let him have . Half an hour later , she capped the ultra-fat permanent marker , finished with the signs asking for her daughter 's release , and suddenly realized her mother had n't returned . Their post office was less than a mile away . It should n't have taken Karena this long to ask someone a simple question . Felice went to the front window and glanced uneasily up the drive . She gasped . The top of their driveway was gone . Her mind tried to understand what she saw in its place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality it perceived , the hole in the world it saw just two hundred yards away . Whatever was there was literally beyond her comprehension . Unable to identify it , her brain filled in the gap with something more reasonable , the way human vision colors in the natural blind spot every person possesses by copying and pasting what surrounds it . A black stain . A floating miasma that erased ground and gravel and cattle guard . Everything in Felice tensed , came to a stop , her heart , her breath , her thoughts . The sight paralyzed her completely . Intelligent , the thing reacted the moment Felice came to the window , as if it could see her , roiling swiftly down the drive toward the house . " Stop . " Felice knew she had spoken , though she did n't feel her lips move , could n't hear her heart beating or see her chest rise and fall . The phenomenon slowed its progress and halted in place , consuming the empty parking spot in front of the house and the volunteer sumac shading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set in . What was that thing ? What did it want ? Had it hurt her mother ? She knew in her soul that Karena needed her right now . Something horrid had or was about to happen . She had no car . Her mother had taken it , which meant she 'd have to rush the mile to the post office on foot . Past that . " Go away , " she said . It did n't move . " Please just go away . " It came closer , past the four-story fir tree where owls hooted at night , past sleeping forsythia bushes , over the ring of stones marking the bed where peonies and poison ivy flourished in late spring , around the front porch , halting only when it was in arm 's reach of the window where Felice stood . The wrongness of it swallowed everything . Incredulity struck Felice blind seconds before the stain formed fingers to touch the window glass inches from her face . When her world finally came back to her , she discovered herself racing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gotten here ? Had It put her here ? Had she managed to get around it , through it ? Her throat burned , her body unaccustomed to exertion in the raw air , as she sprinted through a church parking lot and arrived at the post office . Parked in front , the Chevette 's engine was still running , but no Karena . Instead , an elderly man dressed in a puffy silver jacket that belonged on someone sixty years his junior attempted to flag down a rusted-out minivan speeding by on the highway . It would n't stop and the man , drained by the effort , crumpled to the asphalt parking lot like a discarded ball of aluminum foil . As he fell , his arms wrapped around something at his feet . " Mom ! " Felice cried . " This your Ma ? " asked the man , who had only three teeth and smelled of moldy carpeting . She nodded . He released his protective hold on Karena and crawled aside . " She fell down , " he said . " Felice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body shuddered . Her skin was tinged a cross between vein blue and shocky white . She labored to sit up and failed . " I ca n't breathe . " NINE-ONE-ONE put her on hold with an estimated wait time of thirty-one minutes . Cherry Lick 's local volunteer fire and rescue did n't answer their direct line . Karena tried but was already too weak to stand , let alone walk as her daughter assisted her to the car 's passenger seat . Sweet , very sweet , though he knew the risks , the old man did his best to help , but mostly got in the way . " You should stand back , " Felice told him . " I do n't want you to get it . " " My son is dead , " he began , shaking his head . " I 'm tired of winter . " Felice nodded her understanding and laid her hand lightly on his shoulder . It sagged beneath her palm . Though uncomfortable saying it because his sense of the divine was not her own , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She smiled at him . " God is standing right beside you , " she said . " I see him . His hand is on your other shoulder . He will be there when he brings your son to welcome you home . " The old man 's lips trembled . " Thank you , " he said . She climbed in behind the wheel , backed up and tore out of the parking lot as fast as the ancient hatchback would take mother and daughter toward the nearest hospital . A National Guard roadblock barred her way half a mile from White Sulphur Springs . " I 'm sorry , ma'am , " the female soldier with bleach-fried hair and an M-16 rifle told her , after instructing her to roll down her window no more than a crack . Most of her face hid behind a mask that Felice guessed must have dated to the first Gulf War . " I ca n't let you pass . White Sulphur Springs , Lewisburg , and Ronceverte are under quarantine . " " Quarantine ! " Felice cried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ma'am . " " But I have to get my mother to the hospital . " " The hospital 's full . " " The clinics ? " " Those resources have been deployed elsewhere . " Felice made a choking sound . " Deployed ? Where ? How do you deploy a building ? This is an emergency ! My mother needs immediate care . " " I understand , ma'am , but I ca n't let you pass . " Felice gazed beyond the military Hummers and barricades , attempting to see what went on farther down the road at the edge of White Sulphur . " Do n't even think about it , " the soldier said . " Think about what ? " Felice asked innocently , but knew her thoughts were transparent . " We have all the roads , all of them . You ca n't get into town . " " My mother is .... " She did n't want to say dying , not when Karena could hear her and give up before they could find help . " My mother is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time since their encounter , the soldier bent down and looked into the car at Karena slumped in the passenger 's seat , laboring to breathe . " I can see that , ma'am , " she said finally . " Here . " Latex clad fingers pushed a slip of paper through the crack between window glass and door frame . It fluttered into Felice 's lap . The phone number for a rural aide worker . " They usually have Tamiflu and some of the other drugs . That 's all I can do , " the woman said . " Now , please , if you 'll turn around over there . " Felice turned and drove all of fifty feet to a pay phone . She dialed . The line picked up . " Give me your address , " said a sour-sounding man on the other end of the line . Felice hesitated , not knowing if she 'd heard right . " You 're calling from the pay phone next to the Hardee 's , are n't you ? " " Yes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you ? " " No . " " My mother , it was so sudden . She was n't showing any signs , but I 'm scared . I think it 's really bad . " " She 's not alone , " the man said . His cold , impersonal tone caught Felice by surprise . " No , you 're not hearing me , " she said . " No , you 're not hearing me . Give me your address and go home . My wife will be there when she can . " A cold drizzle slicked the highway as Felice rushed toward Cherry Lick . It turned to hard rain once the barricade was out of sight and the wind picked up . As she passed Risa 's school with its construction paper Thanksgiving turkeys still in the windows and the forlorn look of someplace that would never reopen , hail peppered the windshield . Icy rain came next , slashing at the trees , streaking by the side window like globs of frozen spit . Her tires shimmied on the curves . The road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spit became wet snow . The roads were eerie , untraveled by anyone except for a car heading the opposite way with an urgency Felice recognized . Karena complained every moment of the way home , growing less lucid by the mile . Felice worried the freezing temperatures in the car exacerbated her rapidly deteriorating condition . Their heater was broken , but she cranked it on high anyway in hopes it would miraculously revive . Her mother coughed uncontrollably . Now that professional medical care proved to be out of reach , Felice cursed herself for making the decision to drive rather than go straight home and continue to call for help from there . Alarm settled in her chest and permanently altered the tempo of her heart . She could n't get home quick enough , could n't turn the wheel and slide and fishtail through this white crap mounting up on the roads fast enough . Get Mom to warmth , she thought over and over again , concerned the aide worker would arrive at their cabin , find no one there , and pass them by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to be something in there I can give her . As she turned onto their road , it occurred to her that she had n't seen their home since the stain had come . What would she find when she rounded that final bend ? Would the top of the drive still be a black hole ? Would there be a drop-off into nothingness where she normally parked the car ? Would It be waiting for them ? What had she been thinking to give the aide worker 's husband this address ? She could have lied and taken Karena to any number of empty houses she 'd visited yesterday , the bus driver 's place , for instance . Five-inch drifts as coarse and sloppy as ice rink shavings covered the drive . No holes , no dark , boiling fog . Just snow and - she lifted her foot off the gas momentarily when she spotted them - tracks . Not knowing what to expect , she veered down their steep drive , obliterating the signs of human visitation leading to their porch . A slight figure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , taking shelter under the overhang . Hearing the car rattle over the cattle guard , the obviously miserable refugee looked up . " Risa ? " Felice whispered . She forgot to be careful in the snow and slammed on the brakes , barely able to keep the car from sliding sideways into the pasture . " What ? " Karena blinked . " Did you say Risa ? Is she back ? " " Yes , Mom . Risa 's back . " Yesterday she would have endured any torture , any loss to get her daughter back , see her running toward the car , made clumsy by the snow . Would have stomped on the parking brake , thrown open the door and gathered Risa in her arms in delirious reunion , swearing never to let her daughter go again . Today , she honked the horn , beat on it several times until Risa got the message and stopped twenty feet from the car . Its headlights spotlighted her confused face through the heavy flakes falling between them , her nose and birthmark reddened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was soaking wet from her sneakers up to her knees from hiking through drifts . The thin , unfamiliar coat could not have kept her warm on her journey . Felice opened her window . " Stay away ! " she shouted . " Grandma 's not feeling well . " " But , Mom - " " No , Risa , stay back ! " " I could n't find the spare key under the snow . " " Risa , listen to me . I 'm going to turn off the engine and throw my keys to you . " Felice did n't know if she was already contagious , did n't know if objects could pass this disease to others , but did n't want to take the chance . " I want you to take off one of your socks and put it over your hand . " " What ? " Risa , expecting her mother to comfort her , not bark orders at her , began to cry in exhaustion and fear . " It 'll be okay , sweetie . Just do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , listen to me ! " she said . " Open the house , leave the keys in the lock , and go to the kitchen . I want you to make yourself some hot chocolate in the microwave and take it up the back stairs to your room . Change out of your wet clothes and get under every blanket you have . Do not come downstairs , no matter what you hear . As soon as I have Grandma settled in her room , I 'll be up to see you . " Risa , ignoring everything she 'd just said , started toward the car again . Felice laid on the horn and , eventually , her daughter grasped the seriousness of the situation . " I love you , Risa , " Felice said . " I do n't know how you got here , but I 'm so glad . " She lobbed the keys into the snow . " Now , go ! " YOU 'RE lucky , " said Trina , the home aide worker , a fortyish woman with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mask tied so tightly around her head it creased her cheeks . " You 're the last house I 'll be able to visit tonight . If I do n't start now , I do n't think I 'll make it home . " " Yes , " Felice said , " come in , please . " Felice gave the woman points for achieving the near impossible , finding their half-hidden drive in white-out conditions and having the guts to navigate down the driveway . " Oh . " Trina grunted thoughtlessly when she saw Karena . The look she gave Felice offered no hope whatsoever . " She has it . " After all she 'd been through already , and the undignified struggle dragging her mom through the snow , scraping and bruising them both because she was n't strong enough to carry her , tearing the medicine chest apart and throwing every last useless thing on the floor in her frantic search for something that could make Karena feel better , sitting by her bed and holding her hand and reassuring her again and again and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here any second - to have this stranger come in and dismiss her chances so casually made Felice want to rip the woman 's throat out . " Please . " Felice gestured for them to step into the next room . She spoke in a low voice . " You 're going to tell me there 's no chance for her and I do n't want her to hear that . " " I can give you some OTC flu medications , Sudafed , Benadryl - " " What ? " Felice was stunned . " I thought you were going to bring us real help . The woman at the barricade said you carry Tamiflu . " " I 'm not a doctor , " Trina said . " I 'm not even a nurse . The rules do n't allow aide workers here to dispense prescription medications . " " Rules ! What do the rules matter now ? " " I 'm sorry . " Trina dug into the bulging carry-all hanging from her shoulder and retrieved a package of non-prescription flu tablets . Felice begged for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , forgetting to whisper , her voice steadily rising . " My mother is the only family my daughter and I have . We 're all each other has . Please , you must have something else in that bag . My mother should be in a hospital right now . " Trina set the package of flu tablets on a table and stared at Felice for several seconds , undecided . Finally , she reached into the bag again and brought out a small , black book . " A Bible ? " Felice said . " Our savior is the hope you 're seeking right now , " Trina said . From the other room , Karena burst into the conversation . " Does everyone here have to be a turd for Jesus ? " Felice 's eyes widened and she felt herself blush . " What ? " Trina asked , as she ventured into Karena 's room again . Karena , hysterical at the onset of chronic pneumonia , fought the confines of her blankets . Every word she spoke came out like the moan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , does everyone here have to be a turd for Jesus ? " " Turd ? " Felice forced her voice to be light . She did n't want her mom to drive this woman away before she could convince her to help . " You have n't been hanging out with Risa 's friends , have you ? " Her mother would n't be jollied out of her anger . " Felice , what on Earth made you decide to bring us here ? The moment we moved into this house , I knew it would be the last one I 'd ever live in . I knew I 'd die in Cherry Lick . I love you , Felice , but I 'll always resent you for this . I just do n't get it . Why here ? This is n't your home . Christ , these people live , eat , breath Him . They 're so obsessed with the Bible they fart and belch in scripture . " Clearly offended , but retaining her professionalism , the aide worker backed out of the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Felice looked over her shoulder at Trina . The woman appeared ready to bolt for home , but Felice put everything she could into communicating their need using her eyes alone . She had the feeling that behind her mask , the aide worker 's lips pursed in a stern frown . . At last Trina nodded and the corners of her eyes softened in a smile , one Felice felt certain was pity . " God bless your family , " she said . A moment later , the front door clicked shut . Felice rose to turn the lock and saw it , a small , brown paper sack next to the package of OTC flu remedy . She opened it and peered inside at two sample packs of prescription medicine , the type doctors often gave to their patients as free trials . She dosed Karena immediately , then sat in the chair next to her mother 's bed , with the phone to her ear , on hold with 911 for another hour before she gave up . Upstairs , Risa would be lying frightened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received her medicine . Felice knew she should go up and reassure her daughter , yet when she started to leave , she noticed her mother 's gaze searching timidly about the room . " Mom ? " Karena did n't answer , showed no signs that she heard Felice . Her eyes grew weepy and red around the rims . Gone was the confident , outspoken woman . " Mom ? What is it ? What can I get for you ? " Felice did n't really need to ask . She could see it in Karena 's eyes . Only one look had that type of desperation . Her mom wanted her own mother , long dead . " I want to go home , " Karena stated . " I know , " Felice said , softly stroking her mother 's damp brow . " Back to Los Pinos . " " Home , " Felice nodded and said . " I miss it so much . " " Get well ! " Felice said , her own eyes hot , ready to spill over . " Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will . " " Mom ? " Risa called to her from her bedroom . " I 'll be up there in a minute , " Felice told her . " Did you do what I said ? Are you warm ? " " Yes , Mom , but there 's something I have to - " Felice could n't handle things a moment longer . She needed escape . " In a minute , sweetie . " She rushed out the back door , not even stopping to put on a coat . Snow blew under the porch eaves . It frosted the old slatted swing , which gyrated wildly in the wind , suspended by twin lengths of chain . Felice paced up and down the narrow portion of decking free of drifts . Flakes landed in her eyes and melted in her tears . She 'd never felt guilt this heavy . What possessed her to bring her family here ? Her mother was among the seventy-two percent . She would die tonight without seeing home ever again . More than anything , she wished she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though she 'd told Risa she 'd be only a minute , she paced until her energy ran out and her feet stumbled . Uncaring that the wind and snow plastered her back , she brushed off the porch swing 's painted slats and collapsed into it . Her weight calmed its fierce movements and she stared out into the back pasture . Snow made the wind visible . Its currents and whirlpools , tossing and thrashing , a stormy sea not normally seen , hypnotized her . Her emotionally exhausted mind groped for understanding , the reason for all of this , the reason for everything . What was the black stain and why did it come here ? Why could n't she remember her mysterious visitor the moment he left ? Who was he ? " Felice , " he 'd said . " I want her . " Finally , the cold and wet penetrated her overexcited , overheated body . Dusk encroached , turning the storm midnight blue . She realized she had to go in . Half-blinded by the snow , she almost missed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curious , she shielded her eyes and descended the steps , then punched through the drifts toward the shelter of the tree , where the snow was only a couple of inches deep . At first she thought they were plastic , blown here across the miles from the cemetery in town , where wreaths of fake flowers adorned nearly every grave . Then she crouched down and touched the poppy-like petals . Each blossom had a black spot at the center in the shape of a three-pointed star . She dug snow away from the slender olive-green stems and discovered that they were firmly rooted in the earth . Her mind would n't accept what she 'd found . How ? she asked herself . " How ? " she said aloud . The small cluster of desert wildflowers did n't belong here . Native to Western Arizona , they did not grow in winter , Felice knew , nor east of New Mexico . In fact , there was only one place she 'd ever seen this particular strain . Blast after blast of wind flattened the blossoms to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In wonder , Felice picked them , protected them in her arms , ran up the steps , through the back door , and into her mother 's bedroom . Two startled heads popped up , when she rushed into the room . " Risa ! " Felice said . Chair pulled up to the bed , her daughter sat with her upper body lying across her grandmother 's bedcovers , gently hugging her . She jerked upright at Felice 's entrance . Alarm Felice imagined would assault her system only during the last moments of her own life , crushed the breath from her lungs . Adrenaline lit her nerve endings painfully on fire . " Oh , Risa ! " " Mom , you do n't have to worry . " " Risa , leave . " " No , Mom . " Felice approached the bed , still clutching her haphazard bouquet of wildflowers . " Please , for me , honey . It may not be too late . " Karena 's glassy eyes fixed instantly on the flowers in her daughter 's hands and lit up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . A feeble hand reached for the gift her daughter brought her . " Is it spring already ? " Felice cupped her mother 's hands around the bunch of lilies and assisted her in lifting them toward her face . Her mother attempted to gather their warm , dusty perfume into her nose . Though Felice knew she could n't possibly smell anything in her condition , Karena pretended the fragrance was magnificent . She sighed and her fingers petted the blossom 's large , soft petals as she smiled up at her daughter . " Thank you for keeping your promise , Felice . Thank you for taking me home . " " Los Pinos , " Felice whispered to her and touched her hand . " Los Pinos . " Her mother sighed again , closing her eyes . " Why , Risa ? " Felice asked when the two stood in the living room together , allowing Karena some fitful sleep . " You 're exposed now . " " Mom , I 've already got it . " " No ! " Felice denied it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been trying to tell you , but you wo n't listen . " " How did you even get here ? " " Mom , listen to me ! " Risa almost shouted . Felice steered her daughter into the kitchen so she would n't agitate Karena . " They all have it up on Muddy Stump . " " What ? How ? They were n't supposed to let anyone near the schoolhouse . They would n't let me near it . Would n't even tell me where it was . I drove around for hours looking for you . " " Sheila snuck out to see her brother , " Risa said . Felice thought about her last conversation with Sheila 's mom , Darla Heiney , the news the following morning . " Sheila 's mom is dead , " Felice said . " So is Sheila . So are half the kids at the school . Sheila gave it to all of us . When that old lady and her two sons who were guarding us died , a bunch of us got in their trucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do n't be so shocked , Mom . The girl who drove me home was about to go for her learner 's permit when Sue hit . " " Sue ? " " Duh . Short for Tsunami . " " Risa , this thing does n't infect everyone automatically . You should n't have gone into your grandmother 's room . You should n't be near me without protection . Go get one of those painter 's masks from the tool box in the furnace closet and put it on . " Risa shrugged . " But , Mom - " " Do it ! " Felice waited until Risa headed toward the storage room at the back of the house , then returned to her mother 's room . She halted one step inside the door . He stood at Karena 's side . His lips were beautiful . His hands , exquisitely carved in flesh and bone and skin flawless as alabaster , spoke of a will no one on Earth could resist . His cruel posture dismissed everything and everyone because whatever anyone wanted truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as prison wire and the icy hue of a meteor shower in mid-winter , but his lips could n't hide what he thought sometimes . Sorrow , genuine and final . " I 'm sorry , " they whispered . Why is he in my house ? Felice wondered dully . He 's always refused to come indoors . " You said you wanted her , " she said . " Why did you want my mother ? " This is n't memory . This is now . I 'm seeing him now . " I can see you changing , Felice , " he said . " You are n't quite forgetting , but you are n't remembering . Time is short . " She tried to force herself to look into his eyes , but she could n't move her gaze above those terrifying , seductive lips . " Whatever you have left to do to prepare , you must hurry . " If she looked into his eyes she would know everything and everything would be lost . She had to forget again . During the precious seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karena 's heart . One moment her mother was there , living in agony . The next , an empty husk grew still and sank deeper into the mattress . Felice saw nothing , no light , no mist , no ghostly apparition . She sobbed at the lack of what her expectations told her she should experience when her mother left her . She 'd had no time . She had n't had the chance to prepare . Though he did n't actually touch her as he passed her , his aura , the black stain , brushed her cheek and she glimpsed a thousand happy memories , a thousand ugly ones , her entire life compressed into a single sensation , one sound , a mixture of rushing water and sun shining on dreaming eyelids , and the half-life of the human body decaying one cell at a time , day by day . Ten minutes , twenty minutes , an hour later , she still had n't forgotten his visit . SHE CLOSED her mother 's door quietly , as if any noise , however slight , might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed to heavy sleet . Icy pellets , identical in size to coarse sand , poured from sky to roof as if from a dump truck loaded with twenty tons of the stuff . They scoured the shingles , hissed down the drainpipes , and overflowed the gutters , cascaded from eaves and overhangs into great piles . Atop the eight-inch drifts already on the ground , even an additional two inches of sleet would make shoveling by hand difficult , if not impossible . Whenever this had happened in the past it always froze rock-hard afterwards , trapping them for days . No one else would be coming tonight , nor tomorrow . No one to comfort or assist them , no one to take Karena away . Felice knew she had to protect her daughter from the smell now seeping through the house . Even if she could have managed the dead weight , Felice could n't bear to put Karena out into the storm . Opening the bedroom window , then closing the door on her mother was the only option she had . Risa waited nervously in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked . Felice smiled a smile that was n't one . " She 's peaceful now . " " She 's dead ? " " Yes . " Felice was n't certain what reaction she should expect from Risa tears , anger , accusations , disbelief . Instead , her daughter bobbed her head numbly in acceptance , turned and climbed the stairs to her room . " Risa ? " " I 'm okay . " Felice knew for a fact that she was n't , Risa 's fatalistic attitude upsetting her more than the blame for which she had braced . It 's okay . I 'm going to die . You 're going to die . We 're all going to die , her daughter 's eyes said . She had to do something . She had to turn this around immediately . She scrubbed herself raw in a hot shower , put on fresh clothes , then found a second mask in the furnace closet . Food for Risa came next . Scrounging in the refrigerator , she considered making her daughter 's favorite soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet nondescript vegetable instead . If Risa ate French onion now , she would hate it forever , always reminded of her grandmother 's death when it crossed her lips . She baked biscuits to go with the soup , slathered them in butter and jam and placed everything on a tray . Risa 's room was terrifyingly neat . She 'd picked up everything off of her floor and thrown away the trash , changed her bed linens , arranged stuffed animals , slipped papers and odds and ends into drawers , stacked and sorted books into two piles , those belonging to the public library and her school . Most frightening of all was the clothes basket on the floor next to her dresser . Not only had she swept every piece of dirty clothing into the basket , she 'd lined it with a thirty-gallon trash bag . Felice 's throat tightened . That a twelve-year-old would think of this , prepare like this , undid her . " Are you okay , Mom ? " Risa asked from the bed where she sat stiffly upright . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tray across her daughter 's lap . " I brought you some soup . " " I do n't want to eat . " " I think you should . Scoot over . I 'll sit next to you and we 'll watch some TV . " Risa gave her control of the remote . She flipped through the channels , finding more than half had gone off the air . With the exception of a few news networks , snowy static replaced any channel or program requiring live or recently recorded content . Eventually she found a cheesy romance flick on a station that appeared to be computer automated rather than manned by living persons , and made no mention of the plague . " I 'm scared for you , Mom , " Risa surprised her by saying forty minutes into the movie . " I do n't want you to be all alone . " " Honey , you 're not going to die . You 're not even showing symptoms . Even if you got it , I know you 'd survive . " " How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandma was older . This flu strikes older people the hardest . Older people and the very young . Now , I know you 're not eligible for social security , are you ? " Risa giggled . " And you 're not a little girl anymore . You 're almost thirteen . " " Tomorrow , " Risa said with evident pride . Oh , God . Her birthday 's tomorrow . The special birthday . " That 's right . Tomorrow . And I have something special planned . " She had no such thing . With all that had happened , she 'd forgotten . It seemed ghoulish to even think of celebrating , but kids had a different reality from adults . Risa choked softly and suddenly rubbed her neck . " What is it ? Did you swallow something the wrong way ? " " My throat hurts , " Risa said . She vomited the soup and biscuits within the hour . By midnight she had a fever . Karena had n't lived long enough to use much of the prescription meds , so Felice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start , gave Risa a double dose . She got on the phone with 911 again , which this time did n't even answer , let alone put her on hold . Children 's grape-flavored expectorant initially quieted the cough Risa developed around two-thirty in the morning , but less than thirty minutes later it was back , and Felice heard it working its way down into her bronchial tubes and finally her lungs . I will not lose her . I wo n't , Felice promised herself over and over through the night , while she phoned Trina , the health department , ambulance companies , the pharmacy at the megacenter , every doctor in their meager rural phone book , seeking help or even advice . Yes , it was the middle of the night , but given the times , she expected at least one phone to be answered by a live person . At dawn , the sun rose shrouded behind weather dark as a funeral veil . Fifteen hours and still the sleet continued , entombing them in a foot-and-a-half of solid ice . Piles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doors . Almost no light reached the ground . Instinctively , Felice glanced toward the drive , but could n't see it through the gloom , anticipating , steeling herself for the fight she knew lay ahead . She had no hope . Karena had struggled to breathe , Risa did n't . Karena 's soul , her person had wrestled with the confines of a body that sought to smother her , wanting out , wanting freedom . Risa 's did not . Her figure lay limp beneath the covers , hair slick with perspiration , lips blue from lack of oxygen . She choked on every breath , no longer having the energy to cough . The only movement came when she clawed ineffectually at her chest . A bloody , wadded tissue fell from her fingers . " Happy Birthday , sleepyhead , " Felice said . Risa 's eyelids , pained slits , worked to open all the way . " Hi . " Felice carried a zippered plastic bag , printed with mod pink and orange flowers . Risa saw the pouch . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all grown up . " Makeup was all Risa had talked about this last year , when she would be allowed to wear it . Since the age of ten , she 'd requested foundation to cover her birthmark , plus the mascara and lip gloss she swore - with a straight face - that the other girls wore . Felice unzipped the pouch , removed astringent towelettes , a bottle of moisturizer , and another of foundation . All were hers , but they 'd work well enough to make her daughter happy now , when time was so precious . " Shall I give you a makeover ? " " Yes , please . " Felice hated putting anything on those pale yet perfect cheeks . Her daughter 's cryptic beauty needed no enhancement . Like most girls her age , however , she equated artifice with sophistication , and the drive for sophistication was every thirteen-year-old 's secret aspiration . Covertly wiping away blood and spittle from the corners of her daughter 's mouth , Felice dotted beige liquid on forehead , chin , nose , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sure ? " At that moment a bead of sweat rolled into Felice 's right eye from her browline . Something that felt like a lead butterfly contorted , then drowned in her lungs . Dizziness rocked her from side to side . She could n't suppress a hacking cough that labored to clear her throat of mucus that quivered and unexpectedly blocked her airway . " I 'm sure , " Risa said . " He has to know I love it . " " He ? " If Risa answered , Felice did n't hear it . She put a hand to her temple , instinctively trying to squelch the throbbing that began there . No . Please not yet . I have to help my baby . She fumbled through the rest of the makeover , worried that the weakness infecting her so suddenly would result in a heavy-handed job too close to makeup on a corpse . When she held the mirror up to her child 's face , however , something glorious happened . Her daughter 's color came back , her eyes brightened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Risa . For just a moment , Felice glimpsed the joyful adult her daughter was meant to be . " It 's been so long since I heard you laugh like that , " Felice said . " Thanks , Mom . I 'm gorgeous . " " Yes , you are , " she said , and passed out . He was bent over her daughter when Felice woke . The ends of his long , black hair tickled Risa 's throat . His fingers lovingly caressed the side of her chin , still baby soft . " No , " Felice cried . " You ca n't have her . She 's mine . She belongs in this world . " " In my world , now , " he said . " She 's thirteen . That was our agreement . " He lowered those exquisite lips to Risa 's cheek , the one with the mark laid on her since birth . Odd , why had she never noticed it before ? Her birthmark took the shape of a partial kiss . The instant lips met cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face . She opened her eyes . " Daddy ! " she whispered . " I 'm here , little dove . " " I 'm afraid . I ca n't breathe anymore . " " I know , " he said . " Time to come home with me . " " No , please , " Felice said . " I love her so much . I need her . " For the first time she found the strength of will to look up into his eyes . At once she knew everything , and everything was lost . " Wake up , Felice . It 's time to stop dreaming your human dreams . " " You took her , " Felice accused , unable to fight the weight of eyelids that no longer responded . " I did n't make you choose the place where sickness would be the worst . " " You 're Death , " she said . " And you are The Moment of Joy Before , " he told her . " It 's time to stop pretending . To see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer each day you forget . " But had n't she suffered , too ? " I 've missed you , my love . I need you . Our daughter needs you . " No . No one needed her . She was all alone now in the cabin in Cherry Lick . " Wake ! " he ordered . Felice got up . She sat up through her cooling skin , through her face and those dead eyelids , shrugging off hideously rigid muscle and disgusting , congealing flesh . He laid the fingers of one hand against her face and moved her so she was forced to meet his eyes . They were kind . They hungered . She knew the man who lived within them . " I am Eternity . I am Love . I am your Last Dream , " he said , " Come to me . " On the other side of the door , the sun broke free of its black veil , just in time to set . Sleet became snow once again . Slanted , late daylight transmuted snowflakes from ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fevered cheeks . She took his hand . <p>
