Rainbow Randolph ( Robin Williams ) , the beloved kid-show host , is ruined and then fired when he 's caught taking bribes . His re-placement is the title character , a fuchsia-coated rhino under whose skin lurks the politically correct , morally perfect but terminally nerdy Sheldon Mopes ( Edward Norton ) . Naturally , the axed ex-host wants to off his sweet-souled successor . There 's probably a tight , funny comedy lurking in that premise . But DeVito has turned the film into an expressionistic epic in murderously bad taste , all frenzy and feckless subplots , mostly involving ghastly gangland figures . A lot of good actors ( among them the divine Catherine Keener ) are wasted  --  in both senses of the word  --  in this spectacularly miscalculated movie . <P>  --  By Richard Schickel
