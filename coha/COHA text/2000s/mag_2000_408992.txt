FROM AQUA SEAS AND SECLUDED SANDS TO NEARLY ANY SPORT UNDER THE SUN , THESE FIVE ROMANTIC GETAWAYS PROVIDE EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO FEEL LIKE A NATURAL ( OR AU NATUREL ) WOMAN . // The first time I went skinny-dipping I was 10 . I had been playing in our backyard pool when my 13-year-old neighbor , Adam , came over and joined me . When our usual game of " Marco Polo " got old , my adventurous playmate suggested it might be great fun to ditch our suits and backstroke in the buff . I said we 'd probably get in trouble . Turns out we were both right . A good scolding notwithstanding , I had discoverd the bliss of exposing virgin flesh to air , to water , to sunshine - and I was hooked . My innumerable nerve endings and I were new best friends , and we remain markedly close to this day . This is not an exhibitionist thing , I assure you . I 'm the girl at the gym who changes in the toilet stall , the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hot dog stand . I 'm looking for an experience - not an audience . In fact , the fear of actually being busted in the buff is almost enough to make me keep my birthday suit under permanent public wraps . ( And the fear of melanoma has me slathering on healthy amounts of sunblock when I do disrobe in the great outdoors . ) But now and then , when the time is right and the urge strikes , I ca n't help but toss caution to the wind - and my top right along with it . Valentine 's Day ... Catalina Island ... Romantic getaway ... It started the second we boarded the Catalina Express , a massive speedboat that whips you from Long Beach ( also San Pedro and Dana Point ) , Calif , to Avalon , the island 's principal harbor town . With the sun searing my skin and the wind whipping my hair into what I hoped was an irresistibly sexy frenzy , I turned to my very-significant other . " I want to get naked , " I whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , checking out the other passengers and looking more than a little guilty . " No , silly , " I answered . " All weekend . Whenever we can . Wherever we can . " Joe , who generally respects and appreciates my sensual side , broke out into the mother of all smug grins . " Twist my arm , " he replied with a mock shrug , although I knew that was n't going to be necessary . The minute we checked into the Hotel Metropole it was apparent that the clothing-optional theme was not going to be a problem here . Boasting eclectic , drop-dead furnishings that would leave the folks at Shabby Chic weak with lust , the Metropole is not like being at home - it 's like being in your dream home . You know , the one with an oversized jacuzzi tub and a breathtaking Mediterranean-like view off the balcony and so many down-filled pillows that you begin to wonder if there are any birds-of-a-feather left on earth . Pants be damned ! To a symphony of wooden shutters being modestly rearranged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Note to self Declare living room garment-fee zone at least once a week . ) A relatively big island - 21 miles long - Catalina is nearly entirely owned and protected by the local Conservancy . Once you get outside the very-cozy town limits of Avalon - whether by land or by sea - you@re surrounded by endless rolling hills and deserted beaches . When your goal is to become the quintessential bare-naked lady , it 's good to know you can go for miles in any direction and not run into another biped ( although if four-legged friends concern you , do note that buffalo , sheep and pig run wild on the island ) . For our first foray , Joe and I walked the six minutes from our midtown digs to Descanso Beach , the local launching pad for kayaks . To combat the morning 's chill , the kind folks at Descanso Beach Ocean Sports , Avalon 's top outfitter , furnished us with all manner of dry gear before sending us off . We started with a two-hour guided tour , then bid our guide " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aforementioned deserted shores . About which , let me say this : Until you 've stretched out on smooth , sun-baked rocks while a nippy breeze nibbles on your exposed flesh , you have not lived . For obvious reasons ( comfort and hygiene , mainly ) , we agreed to take a break from our nude-fest during our horseback ride . But back at the Metropole , a post-Jacuzzi snooze in the buff on our secluded balcony felt as decadent and delicious as the full-fat ice cream sundaes we treated ourselves to when we woke up . What can I say ? Sensuality is addictive . Besides , we 'd earned it . ( And none of your business how ! ) Since cars are terribly unwelcome on the island ( residents wait 15-20 years for vehicular privileges ) , renting one for exploratory purposes was n't an option . When feet or hooves just wo n't do , you can whip around in one of the many golf carts for hire ( and act out your secret Wilma Flintstone fantasies in the process ) . After a brief stint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road and found ourselves in a quaint residential neighborhood . After a few similar exit attempts , we hit pay dirt - literally : a narrow dusty road leading to the very tip of the ridge , featuring awesome views of Wrigley ( as in the chewing-gum giant ) Gardens and the entire cove below . Feeling like the only two souls in existence , we exchanged a now-or-never look and began untying our sneakers . Unfortunately , my sensible side chose that minute to make a guest appearance . " You realize this is costing us 30 bucks an hour , " I remarked , Nike in hand . " Plus we have that great balcony at the hotel , " my equally practical boyfriend agreed . Little-known fact : If you lean forward going downhill , golf carts can hit some extremely impressive speeds . On our hike the next day , I worried Joe might be getting apathetic about this exposure business . As it happens , my anxiety was completely unjustified . It also happens that hiking is extremely popular on Catalina . The lesson here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even when you think you 're all alone in the world , you 're not . Oh yeah , and whenever possible , take the road less traveled . Thinking it silly to have lugged half of our collective wardrobes over to the island for nothing , we did get decked out for a few nice dinners ( options abound , but my favorite meal was a nicely spicy blackened halibut at The Blue Parrot ) . Dinner conversation included whether or not rewriting our resumes to include " avid skinny-dipper " and " fullfrontal hiker " would be wise . Ultimately we rejected the idea , agreeing that stiff-suited corporate types might not share our liberated sense of humor . ( continued on page 121 ) Before you could say " The Full Monty , " it was time to pack up our gear - much of it unworn . Giving new meaning to the quick getaway , we chose Island Express Helicopters for our return to the mainland , which cut the crossing time down to a mere 14 minutes . An obvious graduate of the " leave " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor after takeoff so we could get a parting fly-by shot of Avalon . I missed it already . Photograph From the harbor town of Avalon to deserted beaches and rolling hills , Catalina Island offers plenty of opportunities to show your adventurous side . // Maybe it was the exhilaration of being in the air . Perhaps it had something to do with the spectacular views . But as we sped over the Pacific , my heart danced in and out of its aerobic zone and I swear I could feel the adrenaline pumping through my veins . My inner stripper was pretty tempted ( Take it off ! Take it all off ! ) , but sandwiched as I was between my boyfriend and the unsuspecting pilot , I decided that at least for the time being , it was probably best to keep my clothes on .
