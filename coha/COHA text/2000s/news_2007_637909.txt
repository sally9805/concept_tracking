<p> Since 1982 , Americans have witnessed some significant medical advances and trends , but also <p> a fair number of setbacks and challenges . USA TODAY 's medical reporters look back at the top 25 medical developments ; share your choices at Top25.usatoday.com . <p> 1 AIDS <p> In 1982 , the government selects AIDS , or acquired immunoe deficiency . syndrome , as the formal name for the deadly disease then known as gay-related immune deficiency , or GRID . That same year , the first cases were reported in Africa , and an alarmed Congress held its first hearings on the new disease . AIDS now afflicts 40 million people worldwide , about 900,000 of them in the USA . <p> 2 Quitting the habit <p> Fewer Americans are lighting up , which means more lives saved . A report from the American Cancer Society in 2006 said that men 's death rates from cancer dropped 16% from 1991 to 2003 ; women have n't experienced that dramatic drop-off because smoking rates in women have dropped more recently than those among men . <p> 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them are hitting the buffet lines . Roughly 32% of adults over 20 are obese , or 30 or more pounds over a healthy weight . Research has shown that the extra pounds increase the risk of some types of cancer , diabetes , heart disease and other ills . <p> 4 Cancer screening <p> More Americans are opting to try to find cancer early . In 1987 , only 39% of women over 40 had had a mammogram which can save lives from breast cancer , in the past two years . By 2005 , 66% had been screened in the past two years . Although experts say they do n't yet have evidence that the PSA test saves lives from prostate cancer , 58% of men over 50 had gotten the screening by 2003 , up from 41% in 2000 . Doctors agree that screening has led to an increases in diagnoses : the breast cancer incidence rate rose 17% from 1982 to 2004 , while the rate for prostate cancer ballooned 48% . <p> 5 Prozac anyone ? <p> Eli Lilly and Co. , ' s Prozac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first of a new class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) that were touted as safer than older antidepressants . Primary-care doctors began prescribing the pills , and use quickly soared . The Food and Drug Administration hasrecently ordered the makers of all antidepressants to update their labels , warning of a suicide risk an increased risk of suicide in children and young adults taking the drugs . Still , Now there are five more SSRIs  --  Zoloft , Paxil , Celexa , Luvox and Lexapro  --  plus several newer types of antidepressants . The Food and Drug Administration in 2004 ordered " black box " safety labels on antidepressants , warning that the pillsall , not just ssri 's could increase suicidal behaviornot suicide in children and teenagers ; in May2007 the warning was extended for adults up to age 25 . Still , doctors wrote 227 million . ims healthprescriptions for antidepressants in 2006 , making them the most popular medication . <p> U.S. medicine . <p> 6 Declining infant mortality <p> The infant mortality rate fell by nearly half from 1980 to 2004 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advances in treatment of the sickest and smallest babies , as well as the falling rate of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome , or SIDS . The SIDS death rate dropped 62%. from 1982 to 2004 , to 2,246 babies a year , according to the CDC . While part of the decline in SIDS stems from changes in the way that officials classify infant deaths , Experts credit much of the progress with public health campaigns encouraging parents to put infants to sleep on their backs , remove soft bedding from cribs and not smoke in the home . <p> Yet doctors note that the nation 's infant mortality rate has n't changed much since 2000 , partly because the death rate among minorities is so much higher than among whites . And the USA , in spite of its wealth , ranks 26th in the world  --  tied with Hungary  --  for the percent of infants who survive , according to Save the Children . <p> 7 Statins <p> In 1982 , Merck &; Co. began begins human trials of the first successful cholesterol-lowering drug , lovastatin , and learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , companies have developed a whole class of so-called statins , which are among the world 's top-selling drugs . Merck scientists drew their inspiration from the work of Akria Endo and Masao Kuroda of Tokyo , who theorized that some microbes probably produce cholesterol-blockers to use as weapons against rival microbes that need cholesterol to survive . Merck found lovastatin in a fungus . It was approved for sale as Mevacor in 1987 . <p> 8 Cancer vaccine <p> The Food and Drug Administration in June 2006 approved the first vaccine specifically designed to prevent cancer . The Merck vaccine , Gardasil , blocks infection by two types of the human papillomavirus ( HPV ) that account for about 70% of cervical cancer cases . and two other HPV types responsible for about 90% of cases of genital warts . The debate about whether the vaccine should be mandatory for preteen girls continues . <p> 9 The rise of the AED <p> Hundreds and perhaps thousands of cardiac arrest victims are saved each year by folks using an AED , which delivers a . The device changed the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock to a dying heart . - put by putting the life-saving technology into the hands of anybody willing to perform the heroic act . The first models were sold for home use in 1986 , but it was in the early 1990s when the device became so simplified with voice prompts that even children could use one to save a life . The FDA approved the more simplified technology in 1996 and American Airlines quickly put one on every plane , saving 76 lives in the first 10 years . Now they are required equipment on large airliners and increasingly found in public places like schools , hotels and gyms . <p> 10 Are you having trouble ... <p> TV ads Television commercials for prescription drugs have long been legal , but , until the FDA issued guidelines in 1997 , makers manufacturers were uncertain about how to meet the agency 's requirements for including information about side effects , contraindications and effectiveness . After the guidelines came out , new TV stars , likesuch as purple pills , talking stomachs and a chess-playing beaver , were born . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motherhood was strictly for the premenopausal . But In 1983 , doctors in at Monash University in Melbourne , Australia took an egg from one woman and fertilized it with sperm from the husband of a 25-year-old woman who 'd gone through premature menopause . The resulting embryo was placed in the 25-year-old woman 's uterus , resulting in the world 's first baby conceived with a donor egg . Many recipients of this technology are now Tabloids periodically trumpet the story of a 60-something woman who 's delivered a baby or two with the help of donor eggs , but many recipients are younger women whose ovaries failed prematurely or who carry a genetic disorder they do n't want to pass on . <p> 12 Human blueprint <p> The first draft of the human genome , our genetic blueprint , was published on Feb. 11 , 2000 . The scientific undertaking raises hope of finding causes for many diseases as well as potential cures . <p> 13 Nasty bugs emerge <p> First it was West Nile virus , which made it 's U.S. debut in 1999 . Then came the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emergence of new strains of drug-resistant bacteria . that shrug off antibiotics.such as MRSA , a drug-resistant staphylococcus , and multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis . Partly fueled by globalization and misuse of antibiotics , nasty bugs areincreasingly on the rise . <p> making their presence felt . <p> 14 Medical technology <p> Spectacular innovations in technology have changed the world of medical diagnosis and research . For instance , Magnetic resonance imaging , MRI , which gives a precise inside view of the body , allows doctors to see diseased tissues and organs without surgery.PCR , or polymerase chain reaction , rapidly makes millions of copies of DNA from the tiniest samples , enhancing crime detection and forensics , allowing DNA fingerprinting and ushering in a new era of genetic research . <p> 15 Minimally invasive operations <p> Wider use of laparoscopic surgery has drastically reduced the recovery time for patients undergoing a number of surgical procedures . <p> 16 Hormones begone <p> Hormone therapy was once thought to be a veritable fountain of youth for postmenopausal women , but a landmark government study in 2002 found that Prempro , the topselling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer , heart attacks , stroke and blood clots . Women stopped taking the hormones in droves , and today , they 're prescribed only for relief of hot flashes and other symptoms. , but some scientists still wonder if hormones might protect women 's hearts and brains if taken right after menopause . <p> 17 <p> Johnny 's little helper <p> Children considered hyperactive or unfocused began to take prescription pills . Ritalin , the first drug for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder , became widely used in the last 20 years . Now there are more additional drugs for ADHD , such as Strattera and Concerta . A growing number of adults use the medicines . ADHD drugs are a $4.1 billion business , with 35 million USA prescriptions written in 2006. ims health <p> 18 <p> Targeted cancer therapies <p> Doctors are slowly replacing traditional chemotherapy - which kills all growing cells , both good and bad - with " targeted " cancer drugs designed to block the deadly effects of specific genetic mutations . Herceptin , approved in 1998 for certain breast tumors , and Gleevec , approved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope to develop even more " personalized " medicines , allowing patients to receive drugs tailor-made for their disease . <p> 19 C-section rates <p> The U.S. C-section rate hit an all-time high of 30.2% in 2005 - a 46% increase over 1996 . Growing numbers of older mothers , multiple births and labor inductions are thought to be some of the reasons . but critics also fault doctors who fear they 're more likely to be sued over a vaginal delivery and prefer the convenience of scheduled C-sections . In many parts of the country , liability and staffing concerns have spurred hospitals to ban vaginal deliveries by women who 've previously had a C-section . <p> 20 Drug safety <p> Arthritis drug Vioxx was taken off the market in 2004 because of increased heart attack risk . That would led to concern over the safety of a number of other drugs in the medicine cabinet . <p> 21 Bicycle helmets Child safety <p> Science has led to many changes in parenting . The prevalence of a birth defect called spina bifida declined 31%. from January 1998 to December 1999 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be fortified with folic acid , a vitamin that 's crucial in the early days and weeks of pregnancy , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . <p> Lawmakers have gotten serious about protecting kids on the roads . Since 1993 , 21 states and Washington , D.C. , along with 149 local communities , have passed laws requiring kids to wear bike helmets , which reduce the risk of serious brain injury by 85% , according to the National Highway Safety Administration . And all states now require car seats for children , which cut their risk of the risk of infants and toddlers dying in an accident by more than half . ( first law was in 1979 , other states follow ) <p> Although about half of kids ages 5 to 14 own a helmet , only 25% always wear them while riding , according to the CDC . More than 700 Americans die and more than 500,000 go the hospital each year because of cycling injuries . Nearly 1,500 kids under 14 are killed in car accidents and 200,000 are injured . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid ' 90s . Since 1990 , roughly 8 million Americans and appears to remain strong . Millions of Americans have ditched their eyeglasses or contact lenses for this high-tech laser surgery to correct their eyesight . The first laser was approved for LASIK by the FDA in 1998 , so there is no long-term safety and effectiveness data about the popular eye surgery . <p> 23 <p> Shunning the sun Sunscreen <p> Americans , who once slathered on slicked with baby oil and used reflective shields to enhance their tans , have learned that it 's safer to cover up . Many beachgoers now coat themselves with sunscreens - and even clothing lines - that offer sun protection factors of 55 or more . People seeking darker skin also now have the option of higher-quality tinted lotions and spray-on tans , instead of tanning booths . And while sunglasses were once simply chic , consumers are now wearing them to prevent cataracts . <p> 24 Viagra <p> The little baby-blue pill came onto the U.S. market in 1998 , and erectile dysfunction , or ED , became a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as impotence ) out of the bedroom and onto the television screen . Sen. Bob Dole became the country 's most visible ED sufferer when he became a Viagra pitchman . Viagra was the first pill for ED , but it now faces competition from Cialis and Levitra. and it seems like ED treatments are hawked about as frequently as laundry detergent on TV these days . <p> 25 Botox <p> Even before the FDA approved Botox for cosmetic use in 2002 , Americans were shelling out hundreds of dollars for injections of the stuff , aka botulinum toxin . The shots temporarily paralyze muscles that cause expression lines , which , fans say , creates a more youthful appearance . Shortly after Botox got the nod for cosmetic use , the FDA approved " fillers " to smoothe out wrinkles and folds without surgery . The line between spas and doctors ' offices blurred . <p> Reported by USA TODAY staff . Designed by Lori Sloan . Photo research by Mark E. Miller . Photos : 1 .
