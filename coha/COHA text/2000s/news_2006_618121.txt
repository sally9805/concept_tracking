<p> Washington  --  When Clyde Bryant left a meeting with officials of Caterpillar Inc. in January 2000 , he was optimistic that the heavy equipment giant would pay lucrative royalties for the clean-burning engine he invented . <p> The company had been accused of cheating on the Clean Air Act and was under a court order to stop manufacturing diesel engines that pumped out millions of tons of air pollution . <p> Bryant , a retired Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chemist , had applied for a patent on his engine on May 23 , 1997 . He claimed that it not only would meet Environmental Protection Agency air pollution standards , it would produce greater power while doing so . <p> But after examining Bryant 's pending patent , Caterpillar told the Georgia inventor it was not interested . <p> Since then , Bryant has seen Caterpillar obtain patents for engine innovations similar to his own and reap billions of dollars in sales in only a few years . Company engineers shared a prestigious Inventor of the Year award for one of the patents . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trademark office to declare that the award-winning patent and another one should not have been issued because Bryant had patented the technology himself in 2001 . <p> Now Bryant , who is 79 years old and lives in Alpharetta , has found himself in an escalating international patent war with Caterpillar , a corporation that every hour collects more revenue than his government pension would bring him in 140 years . <p> Advocates for small businesses and individual inventors say Bryant 's predicament symbolizes a contentious struggle that is developing over control of intellectual property in America . <p> Congress and the courts are being pressed to change key patent system rules and legal precedents that for 25 years have given patent holders a legal leg up when they accuse big corporations of infringing on their inventions . <p> Supporters of these changes say the patent system is becoming an increasingly burdensome drag on progress , rather than a way to encourage innovation , as the framers of the U.S. Constitution intended . <p> They say companies operating in a high-technology world have to negotiate a treacherous landscape of poorly drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by bringing new products and services to market . <p> Mark Lemley , a Stanford University law professor whose extensive studies of the system are often cited in scholarly articles , agrees with these views . <p> Lemley testified recently before a House subcommittee chaired by Rep. Lamar Smith ( R-Texas ) , author of a bill that would make some of the changes big companies are asking for . <p> " It is particularly important that Congress act to prevent abuses of the patent system by those who use the patent system not to develop and make products , but to squeeze money out of those who do , " Lemley testified . <p> But others , such as conservative political economist Pat Choate , say the changes sought by big business would cut to the heart of America 's innovative spirit . <p> " The United States does not have a patent litigation crisis , " Choate said in testimony before the Smith subcommittee . <p> " The real litigation threat is to a handful of large corporations , whose business models rely on the aggressive , unapproved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Choate , who was independent presidential candidate Ross Perot 's running mate in 1996 . <p> Lincoln an example <p> Individual inventors and their patents are " a big part of the reason America is America , " said Bob Shaver , a Boise , Idaho , patent lawyer who hosts a blog on invention . <p> " Many of the big ideas in this country came from small inventors , " he said . " They have been at the cutting edge of technology , and the patent system has allowed many of them to have the American dream . " <p> Examples on his blog site include New England machinist Daniel Halliday , who in 1854 patented a windmill with a tail fin that kept it pointed into the wind , and a country lawyer named Abraham Lincoln , who in 1849 invented a way to free stranded riverboats from sandbars . Lincoln is the only patent holder ever to become president of the United States . <p> Caterpillar spokesman Jim Dugan declined to answer most questions submitted for this article . <p> However , he objected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an individual , aging inventor . <p> " Your questions seem to paint this as a Caterpillar-vs. - Clyde Bryant issue , and that simply is not the case , " Dugan said in an e-mail . " This dispute involves Caterpillar Inc. and Entec Engine Corp . Bryant 's company , one publicly held and one privately held company . " <p> Caterpillar , which has sold about 400,000 of the ACERT engines , reported revenue of $36 billion last year . Bryant says he lives on Social Security and a government pension of slightly over $2,000 a month he earned during his 20 years at the CDC . <p> " I have no money at all , to speak of , " he replied when asked if he has hundreds of thousands of dollars some patent experts believe it will cost to defend his invention against attacks by Caterpillar in U.S. , British and German courts , as well as at the patent office . He added later that his answer applied to Entec , the company he created to market his engine , as well as to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caterpillar officials got their first look at Bryant 's new engine in January 2000 , the company and five other diesel manufacturers finally settled an EPA lawsuit that accused them of installing " defeat devices " to sidestep emission tests . The companies agreed to about $1 billion in fines and spending for new pollution control technologies . <p> The EPA said that when the engines were being subjected to emission tests , the defeat devices kept them from reaching temperatures of 2,500 degrees , the point at which nitrogen and oxygen combine to form " NOx , " a principal component of urban smog . <p> The EPA said the devices , which sapped performance and fuel economy , were set aside as soon as the tests were over . <p> Government documents show the strategy was discovered by engineers at Mercedes-Benz , which informed the EPA . Later , Deere and Co. , manufacturer of John Deere tractors and high-end riding lawn mowers , made similar allegations to the agency . <p> Bryant 's invention involves injecting a " charge " of cooled , compressed air into an engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural gas  --  at the instant prior to ignition . This procedure keeps temperatures below the NOx-forming level and improves engine performance , he said . <p> A Caterpillar official called this approach " a quantum leap forward in engine technology , " according to an account of the Peoria , Ill. , meeting written by one of Bryant 's lawyers . Caterpillar spokesman Dugan declined to comment on that account of the meeting . <p> Records at the EPA , the patent office and several courts outline the following sequence of events : <p> * A few weeks after the meeting , Caterpillar informed Entec that it was not interested " at this time " in having a relationship with the smaller company . <p> * Throughout the remainder of 2000 , Caterpillar continued to tell EPA officials that it intended to use a different technology called " cooled exhaust gas recirculation " to reduce NOx emissions . <p> * In March 2001 , the company abruptly announced that it was developing a new kind of engine technology , which would be called " advanced combustion emissions reduction technology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ACERT engines burn more cleanly and involve an injection of cooled , compressed air into the cylinders an instant prior to ignition . <p> * On Aug. 28 , 2001 , Bryant was awarded a patent for his invention . <p> * In 2002 , Caterpillar engineers filed several patent applications for various parts of the ACERT system , and the patents were approved . <p> * On June 16 , 2003 , Bryant 's lawyers wrote to Caterpillar , accusing the company of infringing on his patent with the ACERT engine . Caterpillar rejected the claim . <p> * On Feb. 10 , 2004 , two Caterpillar engineers received an Inventor of the Year award from the Intellectual Property Owners Association for one of the ACERT patents . The organization 's board of directors includes representatives from Coca-Cola , IBM , BellSouth , Caterpillar and other large companies . <p> * On Sept. 17 , 2004 , Atlanta lawyer Louis Isaf , who represents Entec and Bryant , requested that Caterpillar 's award-winning patent and one other be re-examined by the patent office . <p> * On Sept. 22 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patents were for technology Bryant had already invented . The Caterpillar patents should not have been issued , the examiner said . <p> * On Oct. 4 , patent office examiner Sheldon Richter issued a notice declaring that he intended to approve a " continuation " patent to Bryant , refining and expanding some of the claims in the original 2001 patent . Continuation patents have the same effective date as the patents on which they are based . <p> * On Dec. 1 , officials of Caterpillar and Entec met in Isaf 's office in Atlanta discuss terms for Caterpillar licensing the Entec engine . The two sides met again on Dec. 14 in Orlando but could not agree . <p> * On Dec. 21 , Caterpillar filed a lawsuit against Bryant and Entec in Peoria , Ill. , declaring that it feared an infringement suit and asking for a judicial determination that it had not infringed on his patent . <p> * On Jan. 22 of this year , Caterpillar reversed itself and requested re-examination of its own award-winning ACERT patent because of what the patent office described as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On March 13 , Caterpillar requested that the patent office re-examine Bryant 's 2001 patent , as well as a 2003 continuation patent that updated the original patent and refined its claims . <p> * On March 30 , Caterpillar sued in the British High Court of Justice to invalidate Bryant 's British patent . <p> * On May 11 , Caterpillar sued in German Patent Court to have Bryant 's German patent invalidated . <p> Successfully defending his patents could cost Bryant and Entec " a million dollars or more , " said Ronald J. Riley , president of the Professional Inventors Alliance . The organization supports individual inventors and opposes the patent system changes for which large companies are lobbying . <p> " Caterpillar tried first to hijack his patent and , now that that has failed , they are trying to force it into the public domain so they can get his technology for nothing , " Riley said . <p> Bryant abandoned the two European patents rather than try to defend them . To halt the litigation in Peoria , he and Entec filed a " covenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against either of his two existing patents . <p> Bryant 's strategy relies heavily on the " notice of allowance " issued last October by Richter , who said he would approve Bryant 's most recent continuation patent as soon as the appropriate fees were paid . <p> However , records show that on Dec. 20 , Isaf asked that this pending patent approval be held up . The lawyer said he needed time to turn over documents sent to him by Caterpillar lawyers purporting to show that previous patents and articles written about diesel engines predated Bryant 's invention and made it unpatentable . <p> Patent law requires inventors to make this kind of information available to examiners , even if the inventors do not believe it is relevant . Subsequently , Isaf sent Richter several thousand pages of material sent to him by Caterpillar . <p> The patent office immediately removed Richter from the application and appointed a new examiner , Thai-Ba Trieu . <p> Records show that Trieu approved 90 patents last year , most of them related to internal combustion engines . <p> In May , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notified him that she intended to reject most of it , including all of the portions dealing with diesel engines .
