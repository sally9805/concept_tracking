Billy Crudup plays a Coast Guard officer bound for Vietnam ; Jennifer Connelly , a peacenik . Naturally they fall in love . Hey , its the ' 60s . When she 's killed in a car bombing , he goes on to a conventional political career . Years later Connelly starts haunting Crudup : phone calls , glimpses on the street . Is he hallucinating ? Or was the bombing a pretext , letting her slip deeper into the radical underground ? We never really know  --  or care . That 's partly because of the inept production design ( Montreal is visibly not New York City or Chicago ) , partly because of the flat direction and writing ( also Gordon 's ) . It 's time to let these socio-political ghosts die . <P>  --  By Richard Schickel
