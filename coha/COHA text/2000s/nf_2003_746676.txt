Although tolerance for ambiguity has been highlighted as important in the development of creative , integrative thinking in the college setting , few studies have examined ambiguity tolerance and anxiety in response to uncertainties introduced in the classroom . In the current study 101 students completed the McClain 's ( 1993 ) Multiple Stimulus Type Tolerance for Ambiguity Test and rated the importance of eight elements of course structure and anxiety when those elements are absent . Results indicated significant , negative correlations between tolerance for ambiguity scores and anxiety and ratings of importance of course structure in a number of areas . Results suggest that tolerance for ambiguity may be an important variable to assess and train so that students are better prepared for unstructured elements of a course that promote critical thinking and parallel the complexities of the applied world . <p> The ability to tolerate uncertainty or ambiguity was first identified as a stable tendency or personality variable by Budner ( 1962 ) , who defined it as an individual 's propensity to view ambiguous situations as either threatening or desirable . Since this hallmark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markers of success , including objective and subjective supervisory ratings in selection of employees for hiring ( Bauer &; Truxillo , 2000 ) and positive attitudes toward risk ( Johanson , 2000 ; Lauriola &; Levin , 2001 ) . Tolerance has also been found to have an association with relationship skills and performance skills of individuals in training for medical professions ( Morton et al. , 2000 ) . Likewise , intolerance for ambiguity has been associated with a number of anxiety-related problems , including worry , obsessions/compulsions , and panic sensations ( Dugas , Gosselin , &; Ladouceur , 2001 ) . <p> Siegel ( 1980 ) recommended that attributes that predispose an individual to engage in creative or critical thinking be identified and fostered . A significant and positive relationship has been found between creativity and tolerance for ambiguity ( Tegano , 1990 ) . Furnham ( 1995 ) noted that open-mindedness , which has been equated with tolerance for ambiguity , may be a predisposition to critical thinking ( Facione , Facione , &; Sanchez , 1994 ) . Although many other researchers have theorized that tolerance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support the relationship between tolerance for ambiguity and critical thinking is lacking ( Murphy , 1999 ) . Johnson , Court , Roersma &; Kinnaman ( 1995 ) have suggested that instructors of undergraduate programs actively examine tolerance for ambiguity as an important element in development of flexible , integrative , and independent thinking . <p> Recent recommendations for effective instruction ( e.g. , cooperative learning , process-oriented learning , challenges to think creatively ) have decreased structure in many classroom environments , spurring the need to examine influences of student affinity to different elements of course structure ( Johnson et al. , 1995 ; Dougherty et al. , 1995 ; Potthast , 1999 ) . Furnham ( 1994 ) noted that preference for certainty or unambiguous situations may increase the likelihood of affinity to structured elements in learning contexts , such as arriving at one solution ( versus consideration of many ) , rigid dichotomization , and desire for premature closure . Assessment of the relationship between comfort with ambiguity and affinity to structured elements of classroom teaching and evaluation seem important to address given the changing nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills in populations taking coursework in the field of psychology is particularly important given the ambivalent nature of the tasks in this field . Budner ( 1962 ) defined ambiguous situations as those that involved novelty , complexity , or insolubility . In the role of therapist , one would expect to confront each of these elements in addressing client change . In fact , uncertainty is a necessary element of effective clinical work in that re-conceptualization involves dialoguing about client doubts about core beliefs and the development of new repertoires of behavior involves uncertainty about outcome ( Karon , 1998 ; Mooney &; Padesky , 2000 ) . Low tolerance for ambiguity in mental health practitioners has also been associated with perfectionism and low levels of enjoyment of psychotherapy ( Wittenberg &; Norcross , 2001 ) . Yurtsever ( 2001 ) noted that individuals with low tolerance were more likely to distort information . Distortion of information would certainly compromise therapeutic objectivity and effective use of client frame of reference . Further , findings indicating a relationship between intolerance for ambiguity and low endorsement for diversity interventions in business students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field of psychology , where diversity practices are valued as necessary for ethical and competent practice . Collectively , these findings suggest that tolerance for ambiguity is a dimension particularly worthy of examination in individuals in training or practice for the mental health field . <p> This study was designed to assess tolerance for ambiguity in a general undergraduate population and graduate students in the field of psychology . Two hypotheses were proposed : 1 ) there is a positive , significant correlation between tolerance for ambiguity scores and importance ratings for the eight specific elements of course structure assessed in both undergraduate and graduate samples , and 2 ) there is a significant , positive relationship between tolerance for ambiguity scores and anxiety related to the absence of the eight specific elements of course structure assessed for both undergraduate and graduate samples . Method <p> Sample <p> A total of 101 participants were recruited from undergraduate ( 52 ; 45 male , 7 female ) and graduate ( 49 ; 17 male , 32 female ) psychology classes at a small , southeastern military college . The undergraduate sample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majors ( 14% ) , and criminal justice majors ( 9% ) . The remaining 52% reported 17 other majors with percentages ranging from 1% - 7% for each . The undergraduates had completed an average of 50 ( range 0 - 145 ) hours of their major ; mean number of hours currently enrolled was 14 ( range 3 - 23 ) . The majority of the undergraduates identified themselves as Caucasian ( 64% ) , with 12% identified as Hispanic , 8% as Asian , 8% as African-American and 8% , as other . <p> The graduate sample was recruited from master 's level psychology courses . Graduate students had completed an average of 20 hours ( range = 0 - 52 ) ; the mean number of hours enrolled was 7 ( range 3 - 12 ) . The majority of the graduate students identified themselves as Caucasian ( 87% ) , with 10% as African-American , 2% identified as Hispanic , and 2% as Asian . <p> Measures <p> Tolerance for ambiguity was assessed using McLain 's ( 1993 ) Multiple Stimulus Type Tolerance for Ambiguity Test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .86 and convergent validity has been demonstrated with Budner 's ( 1962 ) and MacDonald 's ( 1970 ) scales , with significant correlations of .37 and .58 , respectively . Significant correlations with dogmatism ( r = - .35 ) , receptivity to change ( r = .58 ) , and sensation seeking ( r = .38 ) have also been reported ( McLain , 1993 ) . <p> A course structure questionnaire assessed students ' ratings of eight critical areas of course structure . The eight critical areas included : ( 1 ) presence of course syllabus ; ( 2 ) presence of clear schedule of assigned readings ; ( 3 ) dates for testing scheduled in advance ; ( 4 ) clear outline for lecture topics ; ( 5 ) adherence to lecture topic for a particular lecture ; ( 6 ) specific grading criteria outlined in advance ; ( 7 ) exams emphasizing mastery of knowledge ; and ( 8 ) exams/exercises involving objective versus subjective reporting . Each of the areas was presented as an item for which subjects rated the degree to which they valued this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel anxious if it was not present in courses . Degree to which the student valued each area of structure was assessed using a 10-point likert scale ( 1 = not at all important ; 10 = extremely important ) . Degree of anxiety experienced when the specific structure was not present was also solicited using a 10-point likert scale ( 1=not at all anxious ; 10=extremely anxious ) . <p> Procedures <p> Undergraduate and graduate participants were able to earn class activity points through participation . Undergraduate and graduate students were solicited from psychology courses during class hours in spring and summer semester courses . Participants completed a brief demographic questionnaire assessing gender , age , ethnicity , hours of study in the current semester , hours completed in studies , and degrees received . Following an explanation of procedures and introduction of consent form , students willing to participate completed the questionnaire on course structure and the MSTAT . All measures were completed in approximately ten minutes . Results <p> One-tailed correlation analyses were conducted to determine if higher levels of ambiguity tolerance were associated with lower levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of high structure in areas noted . An alpha level of .05 significance was set for all analyses . For the undergraduate sample , significant correlations were noted between tolerance for ambiguity scores and importance ratings for having a clear schedule of assigned readings ( r = - 3.27 , p &lt; .05 ) and anxiety related to either having no test dates or test dates provided rescheduled ( r = - 2.43 , p &lt; .05 ) . <p> For the graduate sample , a significant correlation was noted for the tolerance for ambiguity score and importance ratings for exams having a single , correct answer ( r = - .511 , p &lt; .01 ) . Significant correlations were also noted between the tolerance for ambiguity scores and several anxiety scores , including : not having a test date initially given or a test data being rescheduled ( r = - .259 , p &lt; .05 ) , grading criteria not specifically outlined ( r = - .250 , p &lt; .05 ) , exams that require applied knowledge , and testing situations in which there is no single , correct answer ( r @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both hypotheses were partially supported , as results indicated an inverse relationship between tolerance for ambiguity and the importance of course structures in specific areas only . Although levels of ambiguity tolerance were expected to influence orientation to and preference for certainty introduced through class structure , significant associations with specific elements of course structure for each sample are of interest . <p> For the undergraduates only , low ambiguity tolerance appears to be most strongly related to valuing those elements of course structure that involve scheduling or time management ( i.e. they value having a clear schedule of assigned readings and experience anxiety in response to modifications of test schedules ) . Given that the demands on college students to manage their time are greater than they may have experienced in the high school setting , it is understandable that they may be less comfortable with changes that stretch their time management skills . <p> At the graduate level low tolerance was associated , not only with valuing structure around test dates , but also with discomfort around grading criteria not being specifically outlined , testing that involved applied knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single answer . For graduate students , the general element most likely to produce anxiety appears to be when evaluation extends beyond mastery of rote material . Interestingly , these are likely to be the very same demands faced in a graduate career field in psychology . That is , a career in psychology necessarily involves consideration of events that do not involve a single correct answer ( e.g. , multiple etiologies , multiple controlling variables ) . <p> In both the undergraduate and graduate populations , low tolerance for ambiguity was associated with valuing course structure and with anxiety when the valued elements of structure were missing . These findings may be useful for instructors as they plan their courses . Instructors who are more flexible oz ' unstructured in their approach to assigned readings or testing might want to construct profiles of class tolerance . In classes with high numbers of students with low ambiguity tolerance , instructors might reexamine the utility of employing a more structured approach . Future research is needed to identify the settings ( e.g. , specific career program fields ) likely to have high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These results are important given that attitudes toward course organization have been noted to eventually impact a student 's motivation to learn or perform well in the course ( Gotham &; Christophel , 1992 ) . Given that career fields in psychology necessarily require some level of ambiguity tolerance instructors may also need to consider shaping higher tolerance levels . Students with a low tolerance might be supported in developing a more flexible coping style to help them adapt to a more unstructured classroom environment . To this end , instructors at both the undergraduate and graduate levels may need to provide a rationale highlighting the benefits of raising tolerance , levels with respect to issues that closely parallel those faced in one 's career , such as adapting to necessary adjustments tot organizational or client driven deadlines . <p> Johnson et al . ( 1995 ) have highlighted the importance of addressing and modeling ambiguity-tolerance in the classroom to teach students how to better interface with unavoidable ambiguities in everyday life . They recommended that instructors strive to foster problem solving by modeling an affinity toward ambiguity and outlining how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploration of uncertainties and risk taking . Despite student anxiety , educators should construct evaluations that emphasize explorative , rather than restrictive , exam responses and creativity over mastery of learned content . Training should allow students to practice these skills and become desensitized to anxiety associated with explorative thinking . <p> The most surprising finding in this study was that there was no significant relationship between tolerance for ambiguity and degree of importance/comfort with class discussions in lieu of didactic lectures . Learning style , which was not assessed , may account for a portion of variance in affinity to discussions or lectures ( Seidel &; England , 1999 ) . Nonetheless , it is encouraging that preference for discussions is not impacted by ambiguity tolerance . Class discussions have been noted as superior in promoting long term memory for information when compared to lecture and are a primary medium for fostering the creative , critical thinking recognized recently as a priority in the development of academic curriculums ( Murphy , 2000 ; Gadzella &; Masten , 1998 , Garside , 1996 ) . Future research should continue to examine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in academic settings . Future research might also be directed toward assessment of tolerance for ambiguity as a mediator of particular learning styles . <p> Diminishing uncertainty in one 's environment ( i.e. , low tolerance for ambiguity ) has understandable adaptive functions in certain situations , including avoidance of danger and increasing probability of rewarding outcomes ( Fiske , 1993 ) . However adaptive avoidance of ambiguity might have been in one 's past , however , this intolerance for ambiguity or uncertainty becomes maladaptive when there is overgeneralization and inflexibility in its use ( Elovainio &; Kivimaki , 1999 ) . An inability to tolerate uncertainty across situations has negative implications in that ambiguity might be avoided even when there is a high probability of gain associated with tolerance ( Keren &; Gerritsen , 1999 ) . The gains associated with tolerance in a psychology learning context involve development of open-minded , creative , and flexible thought processes that might enhance future functioning as a counselor . <p> This study represents a preliminary investigation of attributes associated with valuing of course structure . Generalizability of findings in the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample and the unique population of undergraduate students that The Citadel attracts . Future studies should increase the sample size and address the extent to which the relationships found in this study generalize to students from larger , non-military training universities . Collaboration and communication between instructor and student on the important attribute of ambiguity tolerance may , at a minimum , promote student insight into predisposition toward stress and discomfort in particular classroom teaching or evaluation situations . If students can be introduced to and accept the notion that a flexible approach to structure is optimal , they may be more motivated to perform in a setting characterized by varying levels of classroom structure . <p> Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to Virginia M.
