Section : PRODUCT UPDATES tests &; trends <p> The latest generation of dishwashers continues to boast about better washing , but the biggest improvement in washing may actually have come from outside the machine  --  namely , from the dishwashing detergent . In tests for this report we used , for the first time , a new type of detergent with enzymes . When we tried the enzyme detergent in the dishwashers we 've used as controls in past projects  --  a model that has rated excellent and a model that has rated fair  --  both cleaned dishes better than they had when tested with a regular product . As a result , we 've adjusted scores for dishwashers carried over from previous reports to put them on an even keel with currently tested models . Now , nearly all the machines in the Ratings earned very good or excellent washing scores . We 'll have a full report on dishwasher detergents this spring . Which Wash Best ? <p> More dishwashers than ever are supposedly " smart "  --  they have a sensor that tailors the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different ways . Some sensors measure the amount of light that passes through the wash water . Less light is supposed to mean more dirt , requiring more water . But sometimes even small amounts of dirt can cloud the water and fool the sensor into calling for extra , unneeded water . Other sensors measure the actual soil removed from the dishes and collected by the filter . The more soil , the more water sent in . <p> Most machines with a sensor can send in various amounts of water , but those amounts are triggered by different levels of dirt . When we loaded the GE Profile Performance GSD5930F with dishes of which only 10 percent were dirty , it nevertheless sent its largest amount of water to the rescue . The Frigidaire Gallery GPDB998J , on the other hand , adjusted the water more appropriately as we increased the level of dirt . <p> What 's more , the yellow energy-efficiency sticker on washers is largely meaningless on sensor models . The figures are based on a clean wash load . That 's fine for models that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of water no matter how dirty the dishes . But the sensor models come out looking very efficient simply because using clean dishes means the figures are derived when they 're using their lowest water level . Our ennergy-and water-usage scores reflect the dishwashers ' performance with our very dirty load of dishes . <p> As in past tests , we found that the best machines are n't necessarily the most expensive . Pricey machines have their pluses and minuses . They tend to be fairly quiet ; some are especially frugal with energy and water ; and some offer unusual setups , like a top tray for flatware ( the Mieles ) or two drawers that can wash dishes separately ( the Fisher &; Paykel ) . On the minus side , you 'll probably have to take out their filter and clean it periodically  --  perhaps once a month , in typical use ( check the manufacturer 's instructions ) . Overall , most members of the over-$1,000 crowd fell in the middle to bottom half of the Ratings . <p> Although most machines washed very well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are mostly hype . <p> Energy and water use . As we 've said , a few expensive models have the edge here . With the Viking , the tested machine that requires the least energy to operate , you 'll spend $38 per year in electricity using the normal cycle and with an electric hot-water heater . However , with the Maytag MDB9100A and KitchernAid KUDS25SH , you 'll spend $83 per year . ( Costs use the U.S. Department of Energy 's annual figures , as of last February . ) Water use during the normal cycle ranged from 5.1 gallons in the Asko to 11.7 gallons in the GE Profile Performance GSD5930F . <p> Noise . Quiet functioning is a big selling point . The quietest models we tested , the two Mieles , can hardly be heard ; the loudest produce a very noticeable sloshing-water sound , along with motor noise . <p> Special loading . A handful of models were unusually adept at fitting in oversize and odd-size dishes . The Fisher &; Paykel 's two virtually identical drawers hold slightly more than the ten place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neither drawer can hold large plates or platters , as the other machines can . <p> Cycle time . Typically , dishwashers take about 11U2 hours to complete a normal cycle . The fastest , the Viking , took 74 minutes ; the slowest , the Maytag MDB9100A and MDB9150AW and the Jenn-Air JDB9910 , took more than 2 hours . <p> Wash levels . The least-expensive models have two wash levels , but most brands offer machines with three , or even four , levels . More levels can mean better cleaning  --  but not always . The washing scores in the Ratings are a better indicator of washing ability . Recommendations <p> Almost all the dishwashers cleaned very well . Look among the top dozen or so for those with attributes that matter to you . Good values include the Maytag MDB9100A , $560 , and the Maytag MDB3100A , $300 . Both have slight drawbacks : The MDB9100A uses a lot of energy , and the MDB3100A is fairly noisy . If you 're willing to spend more , consider the Maytag MDB9150AW , $750 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repair records : Frigidaire and Asko have been among the less-reliable brands in recent years , according to our reader survey . <p> Design trends : In the Asko 1805 ( above ) and Miele G643SCVi , the controls are on the top edge of the door , allowing the machine to blend with kitchen cabinetry . Both the Mieles we tested have a bare front ; you 'll need to buy a panel to cover it . Also newly popular : an off-white exterior color ( called bisque , biscuit , or linen ) . In the future , leading manufacturers claim , dishwashers will be so smart and self-adjusting they 'll need just one button . <p> STANDOUTS : Two Maytags , the MDB9150AW earned excellent scores in washing , loading , and ease of use . <p> HOW THEY COMPARE <p> Faced with a lineup of washers that all clean pretty well , you may look to features to break a tie . Some of the more prevalent are listed below , along with our assessment of their worth . The chart includes models closely related to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarly . <p> Sensor . This should make the machine use water more efficiently , but that was n't always true . Moreover , a sensor can add about $50 to $100 to a washer 's price . <p> Self-cleaning filter . A filter that cleans itself is convenient . Oddly enough , it 's often the expensive machines that make you empty the filter yourself . <p> Sanitize option . Some machines claim to sanitize by heating water beyond the usual 140 degrees F. Other machines may heat water just as hot without making the claim . In any case , as soon as you remove a dish from the dishwasher , your hands will likely redeposit germs on its surface . <p> Displays time left . It can be nice to know when to expect clean dishes . <p> Stainless-steel tub . Stainless steel should not discolor over time , as plastic might . Features at a glance : Dishwashers TABLE <p> RATINGS Dishwashers Shop Smart <p> The biggest brands are Frigidaire , GE , Kenmore , Maytag , and Whirlpool . Some firms make more than one brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jenn-Air . We have not rated Kenmore ( Sears ) models because Kenmore is updating its lines . We 'll include Kenmores , and new KitchenAids , in our next tests . Asko , Bosch , Fisher &; Paykel , and GE Monogram machines are sold only at independent appliance stores . Other models are at Best Buy , Circuit City , Lowes , Sears , or Wards . The tests behind the Ratings <p> Under brand and model , " new " indicates models tested for this report .
