As the commission looking into the intelligence failures preceding 9/11 resumes its hearings this week , there will be a new exhibit A under public scrutiny : the supersecret CIA report on al-Qaeda that was given to George W. Bush as part of the President 's Daily Brief ( PDB ) on Aug. 6 , 2001 , just weeks before the attacks on the U.S. At the hearings last week , the PDB had been an elephant in the room . Although the commissioners had read the 1 1/4 page text or a summary , and its title  --  " Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US "  --  had been in the public domain since then White House press secretary Ari Fleischer mentioned it in May 2002 to indicate that Bush was aware of the al-Qaeda threat , the White House had refused to declassify the contents .

Citing clandestine and foreign-government sources , it asserts that the terrorist network had set up shop in the U.S. , was carrying out suspicious activity , hoped to strike Washington , might even be planning to hijack airliners and was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains two new pieces of specific information that are likely to prompt more questions . One was a mention of " recent surveillance of federal buildings in New York . " The Administration said last week it had followed up on that report and found that the suspicious characters turned out to be Yemeni tourists . Another item described a threat phoned in to the U.S. embassy in the United Arab Emirates in May 2001 in which the caller said a group of bin Laden supporters was in the U.S. planning attacks with explosives . The caller gave no more specifics , and federal investigators never found a link between the tip and 9/11 , the White House said .
