Writers , like the rest of us , are entitled to slow down when they approach retirement age . What Philip Roth did , as he began anticipating the popularly euphemistic Golden Years , was to gun his engine and rev out in rapid succession three of the strongest , most vibrant novels of his long career . <P> American Pastoral ( 1997 ) examines the fallout from the radical ' 60s on one New Jersey family , specifically on the suffering father of an unrepentant terrorist daughter . I Married a Communist ( 1998 ) , set during the witch hunts of the late ' 40s and early ' 50s , traces that era 's devastating effects on a naive radio actor . The Human Stain ( 2000 ) takes place in 1998 , the year that launched Monica Lewinsky and the Clinton impeachment proceedings , and casts a cold eye on the political correctness that unjustly destroys a college professor 's career . <P> Solely on the basis of his output over the past 10 or so years  --  which also includes the uproarious Operation Shylock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theater ( 1995 ) ; and the terse , erotic The Dying Animal , published in May  --  Roth , 68 , would win much support as America 's best working novelist . Who else during the same period published so much of such consistently high quality ? Even more remarkably , Roth has maintained this elevated standard for more than 40 years , a creative marathon that totals 20 books of fiction . Not all of these are masterpieces , but all are unfailingly ambitious , the products of a mature , demanding artistic conscience . <P> And when he is good , he is spectacular . Roth 's 1959 debut , Goodbye , Columbus , a collection of five stories and the title novella , won a National Book Award . Having leaped from promising to prizewinning in a single bound , Roth could have set about repeating the formula that had brought him such instant recognition . But one of his more intriguing aspects has been his refusal to tailor his work to anyone else 's expectations . Within a decade of the delicate Jamesian fiction in Goodbye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbaric yawp of masturbatory misadventures and comic rage . <P> Younger readers might have a hard chore imagining the impact the best-selling Portnoy 's had on popular culture in 1969 . TV comics and gossip columnists talked incessantly about Roth and his scandalous book , often speculating about the author 's personal life . Surely , so the wisdom ran , Portnoy 's was really autobiographical ; how could Roth have created such a vividly persuasive portrait of a man in hilarious turmoil except by actually being that man ? <P> Such a narrow conception of fiction and its imaginative resources annoyed and exasperated Roth . He could have deflected these misreadings by following Portnoy 's with a novel whose central character bore no surface resemblances to himself . With characteristic contrariness , Roth did the exact opposite . Peter Tarnapol , the narrator of My Life as a Man ( 1974 ) , is , unlike Portnoy but like Roth , a writer and one who has enjoyed early acclaim , hailed as " ' the golden boy of American literature ' ( New York Times Book Review , September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his disastrous first marriage ; that Roth had lived through such an experience was by then fairly common knowledge among his readers . By giving Tarnapol so many of his own biographical details , Roth seemed to be setting a trap for misinterpreters.
