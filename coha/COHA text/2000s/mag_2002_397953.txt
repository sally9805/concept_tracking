Dear Dr. Cory : I have a problem that 's been bothering me for a while . I 'm ten years old and have n't had chickenpox yet . I have n't been vaccinated yet , either ; at least that 's what my mom says.What should I do ? Kendra L. Ypsilanti , Michigan Dear Kendra : Ask your parents about getting the chickenpox vaccine . Parents are encouraged to have their children vaccinated against chickenpox because of the very serious complications that can occur with this disease . Chickenpox is the leading cause of group A , or " flesh eating , " strep , a serious and potentially life-threatening skin infection . In recent years , strep has become a much more dangerous , invasive bacteria . Children can receive the vaccine at any visit to their doctor on or after their first birthday . Any child thirteen years of age or older who has not had chickenpox or has not been immunized should receive two doses of the vaccine at least four weeks apart . Dear Dr. Cory : Every time my sister and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that ? Do you know ? Caitlin sent via e-mail Dear Caitlin : Infected ear lobes can be caused by a dirty earring or earrings that are worn too tight.These infections also can happen when unclean instruments are used to pierce the ears and when the ear lobe is handled by unclean hands . Some earring posts , particularly some of the inexpensive ones , are made from nickel . Nickel can sometimes cause an allergic skin reaction and lead to infection . Signs of infection include tenderness , swelling , or redness around the ear lobe or ear.Yellowish or bloody discharge and any unexplained fever may also mean the ear lobe is infected . Photograph // If you see signs of infection , remove your earrings . Keep the ear lobes clean with soap and water or hydrogen peroxide and apply a little antibiotic ointment , such as Neosporin , twice a day . The redness should go away within 48 hours . If the redness does not go away , if you notice any swelling or redness beyond the pierced area or have any fever , see your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if the infection clears on its own because it could spread . If that happens , you would need to be treated with an antibiotic . You can help to prevent infection in the ear lobe by washing your hands before handling the earrings , by wiping the earring posts with rubbing alcohol before placing them in the ear , and by keeping the ear lobe area clean.You should also wear earrings made of pure silver or gold . Allergic reactions to nickel can lead to infection . Remove earrings before going to sleep to allow the air to circulate around the pierced area . Dear Dr. Cory : Help ! Hair is everywhere ... under my arms and more on my legs . Please answer and tell me why my hair is elsewhere than on my head ! Totally Freaked via e-mail Dear Totally Freaked : We 're all actually covered in very fine hair . The only parts of the body that do n't grow hair are the lips , the palms of the hands , and the soles of the feet . As you enter puberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , begin to cause changes in your body . Both guys and gals begin to grow thicker hair under the arms , on the legs , and around the genital area . Guys also begin to grow noticeable hair on their faces and on their chests . These changes are normal and part of the natural process of becoming an adult . Hair growth is just one of the many changes in your body that you will notice . Dear Dr. Cory : I was wondering what the difference is between the alcohol in rubbing alcohol and the alcohol in alcoholic beverages . Cammi E. North Metro , Georgia Dear Cammi : Ethanol , or ethyl alcohol , is found in alcoholic beverages . Also known as grain alcohol , it is made by fermenting sugar from grains , fruit , or vegetables . Rubbing alcohol , or isopropyl ( i-soPRO-pil ) , is made from the reaction of the gas propylene with water in the presence of an acid or metal . It is used in cosmetics and lotions . It has cleansing and infection-fighting abilities . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Send your health questions to : " Ask Doctor Cory , " Child Life , PO .
