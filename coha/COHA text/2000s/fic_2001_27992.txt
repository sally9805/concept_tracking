it can be a treacherous road , State Route 30 , especially rain-slick in the twilight of late winter , but I know it well . I sped along its badly banked curves faster than legal and faster than necessary . I was heading for Antonelli 's ; I had plenty of time . I drove that way just for the charge , pushing the road , feeling its rhythm in my fingers , its speed in the current in my spine . Water hissed under my tires and my headlights reflected off the fat raindrops that splattered the blacktop in front of me . Years ago , 30 carried a fair amount of tourist traffic , but even then it was people on their way to somewhere else . Now that the state highway slices through the northern part of the county and the Thruway wraps around it , no one passes through Schoharie anymore unless they mean to stop , and not many have a reason to do that . The tourist brochures call this countryside picturesque . If you look closely , though , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junked cars and closed roadside diners with their faded billboards . These rocky hills were never good for much except hunting and dairy farming . Farming 's a hard way to make a living , getting harder ; and hunters are men like me , who come and go . The hiss of water became the crunch of gravel in the lot in front of Antonelli 's . I swung in , parked at the edge . I had Mozart in the CD player , Mitsuko Uchida playing the B-flat Sonata , and I lit a cigarette , opened the window , listened as the music ended in triumph and the exhilaration of promises fulfilled . Then I left the car and strolled over to look acrossthe valley . I was early . City habits die hard . Hands in my pockets , I let my eyes wander the far hills , asked myself what I was doing . Work was n't what this place was about , for me . But on the phone , when Eve Colgate had called , I 'd heard something : not her words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under them . Raindrops tapped my jacket ; a tiny stream ran through the gravel at my feet , searching for the valley . Unexpectedly , I thought of Lydia , her voice on the phone when I 'd called to tell her I was coming up here , would be away awhile . There was music in Lydia 's voice , too ; there always was , though I 'd never told her that . She was n't surprised or bothered that I was leaving . Over the four years we 've known each other she 's come to expect this , my sudden irregular disappearances and returns . In the beginning , of course , I never told her when I was going , did n't call when I got back . Then , we just worked together sometimes ; if she needed someone while I was gone , there were other PIs to call . But at some point , and I could n't say just when , I 'd started calling , to let her know . The rain was ending . Wind rolled the high black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue . The air was full of the smell of earth and promise , everything ready , tense with waiting . Soon spring would explode through the valley and race up the hills , color and noise engulfing the sharp silence . I stood for a while , watched tiny lights wink on in the windows of distant homes . When the sky was dark I turned and went inside . The crowd in Antonelli 's was small and subdued . A golf tournament , all emerald grass and blue sky and palm trees , flickered soundlessly from the TV over the bar . A couple of guys who probably thought golf was a sport were watching it . A few other people were scattered around , at the bar , at the small round tables . None of them was the woman I had come to meet . I slid onto a bar stool . Behind the bar , Tony Antonelli , a compact , craggy man whose muscles moved like small boulders under his flannel shirt , was ringing up someone 's tab . He looked over at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , clinking ice into a squat glass . He splashed in a shot of Jim Beam and handed it to me . " Saw smoke from your place yesterday . " " Big help you are , " I said . " Whole place could burn down , you 'd just watch . " " Happens I drove down to make sure your car was there , wise ass . I ought a charge you for the gas . " " Put it on my tab . " I drank . " How 's Jimmy ? " I asked casually . Tony turned , busied himself with glasses and bottles . " Still outta jail . " I said nothing . He turned back to me . " Well , that 's what you wan na know , ai n't it ? Make sure all your hard work ai n't been wasted ? " " No , " I said . " I knew that . How is he ? " " How the hell do I know ? He do n't live with me no more ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll tell him you 're askin ' . " I nodded and worked on my bourbon . Tony opened Rolling Rocks for two guys down the other end of the bar . He racked some glasses , filled a couple of bowls with pretzels . Then he turned , reached the bourbon bottle off the shelf . He put it on the bar in front of me . " Sorry , " he said . " It ai n't you . I ought a be thankin ' you , I guess . But that no-good punk pisses the hell outta me . He never shoulda came to you . He gets his ass in trouble , he ought a get it out . " " Uh-huh , " I said . " How come you never gave him a break , Tony ? " Tony snorted . " I was too busy feedin ' him ! What the hell you see to like in that kid , Smith ? " I grinned . " Reminds me of me . " " You musta been one godless bastard . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother like you , Tony . I was worse . " " Yeah , well , he should'n'a came to you . And do n't think you 're gon na pay that candy-ass lawyer you brought here . I told you to send me his goddamn bill . " " Forget it . He owed me . " " That 's between you and him . I been bailin ' Jimmy 's ass outta trouble for years ; I got no reason to stop now . I do n't like the kid , Smith , but I 'm family . You ai n't . " I looked at Tony , at the sharp line of his jaw , his brows bristling over his deep-set eyes . " No , " I said slowly . " No , I 'm not . " I poured myself another drink , took the drink and the bottle to a table in the corner , and sat down to wait for Eve Colgate . Another bourbon and a cigarette later , the door opened and a tall , gray-haired woman stepped into the smoky room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked around her , reviewing and dismissing each face until she came to mine . She stayed still for a moment , with no change of expression ; then she came toward me , contained , controlled . She wore a down vest over a black sweater , old , stained jeans , muddy boots . I stood . " Mr. Smith ? " She offered her hand . Her grip was sure , her hand rough . " Thank you for coming . " " Sit down . " I held a chair for her . " Thank you . " She smiled slightly . " Men do n't do this much anymorehelp ladies into their seats . " " I was born in Kentucky . What are you drinking ? " " Tony keeps a bottle of Gran Capitan under the bar for me . " The skin of her face was lined like paper that someone had crumpled and then , in a moment of regret , tried to smooth out again . Her blunt , shoulder-length hair was a dozen shades of gray , from almost-black to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gestured across the room with his eyes as he poured Eve Colgate 's brandy . " You know her ? " " Just met . Why ? " " I meant to tell you she was askin ' about you , coupla days ago . Wondered about it , at the time . She do n't usually talk to nobody . Comes in alone , has a shot , leaves alone . Maybe sometimes she talks cows or apples with somebody . She ain'tI do n't know . " He shook his head over what he did n't know . " But she 's got money . " " My type , Tony . " I picked up her brandy from the bar . " Hey ! " Tony said as I turned . I turned back . " You ai n't workin ' for her ? " " Nah . She just thinks I 'm cute . " " With a puss like you got ? " Tony muttered as I walked away . Eve Colgate 's mouth smiled as I put her drink on the scarred tabletop . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the palest eyes I 'd ever seen , nearly colorless . They probed my face , my hands , swept over the room around us , followed my movements as I drank or lit a cigarette . When they met my eyes they paused , for a moment . They widened slightly , almost imperceptibly , and I thought for no reason of the way a dark room is revealed by a lightning flash , and how much darker it is , after that . I smoked and let Eve Colgate 's eyes play . I did n't meet them again . She took a breath , finally , and spoke , with the cautious manner of a carpenter using a distrusted tool . " I 'm not sure how to begin . " She sipped her brandy . If I had a dollar for every client who started that way I could have had a box at Yankee Stadium , but there was a difference . They usually said it apologetically , as if they expected me to expect them to know how to begin . Eve Colgate was stating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I called you on a matter difficult for me to speak about . I do n't know you , and I do n't know that I want you closely involved in myin my personal affairs . However , I do n't seem to have many options , and all of them are poor . You may be the best of them . " " That 's flattering . " She looked at me steadily . " Do n't be silly . I ca n't pretend to welcome the intrusion you represent . I 'm too old to play games for the sake of your pride , Mr. Smith . I may need you , but I ca n't see any reason to be pleased about it . " I could n't either , so I let it go . She went on , her words clipped . " However , things are as they are . At this point , Mr. Smith , I 'd like to know something more about you . All I have up to now are other people 's opinions , and that 's not enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what you want to know . " " I 'll tell you what I do know . I know you bought Tony 's father 's cabin ten years ago . You come up here irregularly , sometimes for long periods . Tony says you 're moody and you drink . Other than that he speaks very highly of you . I understand you helped get his brother out of serious trouble recentlyand went to considerable trouble to do it . " " The kid deserved a chance . He was in over his head in something he did n't understand . I bought that cabin twelve years ago . I sleep in the nude . " She looked at me sharply over her brandy . Her movements were small and economical . In contrast to her eyes , her body was composed and still . " And are you always rude to your clients ? " she asked . " More often than I 'd like to be . " I refilled my glass from Tony 's bottle . " I 've been a private investigator for sixteen years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpenter . I 've been to college and in the Navy . I drink , I smoke , I eat red meat . That 's it . " " I doubt it , " said Eve Colgate . " Have you a family , Mr. Smith ? " I took a drink . " I had . " " But no longer ? " " I 'm hard to live with . " " Was your wife also hard to live with ? " " Her second husband does n't think so . " " And children ? " That was territory where no one went . I drank , put my cigarette out . " Look , Miss Colgate , you called me . I can use the work , but not the inquisition . I gave you references ; call them if you want , ask about me . " " I have . " She did n't continue . " Well , that 's all you get . " We drank in silence for a while . Eve Colgate 's eyes never rested . They swept the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shelves . They inspected the cobwebs at the raftered ceiling . Every now and then , unpredictably , they returned to me , settling on my face , my hands , taking off again . " Yes , " she said suddenly , draining her glass . " You 'll do . I 'll expect you tomorrow morning . Do you know where I live ? " " You 'll expect me to do what ? " " Somethings were stolen from me . They 're worth a good deal of money ; and yet they 're not as valuable to the thief as they are to me . I want them back . " " The police are good at that sort of thing . " Her eyes flashed . " I 'm not a stupid woman , Mr. Smith . If I 'd wanted the police involved I would have called them . " " Why have n't you ? " She stood . So did I. " I do n't want to discuss it here . If , after I tell you what I need done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay you for your time and your trip . Thank you for the drink , Mr. Smith . " She walked from the room , her back straight , her steps measured . When the door shut behind her the bar was the same as it had been before , as it had always been . Men and women who 'd been stopping in at Antonelli 's after work since Tony 's father had run the place bought each other drinks , talked quietly about sports , the weather , their cars , and their kids . In the back , laughing , smoking , drinking beer from the bottle , was a tableful of young kids who 'd been children when I first started coming here . Now that rear table was clearly theirs , Antonelli 's as much their place as their parents ' . Room had been made for them , and Antonelli 's continued . I swirled the bourbon around in my glass , then signaled to Marie , Tony 's waitress , who was leaning on the bar chewing gum and trading wisecracks with the Rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bouncing over to my table . " Can I get you something ? " Her shaggy hair was bleached to a very pale blond , fine and soft . " Hi . " I pointed to my glass . " I need more ice , and I 'm starving . What do you have ? " " Lasagna . " She nibbled on a maroon fingernail that must have been an inch long . " And bean soup . And the usual stuff . " She giggled . I ordered the lasagna . Marie bounced off chomping open-mouthed on her gum . I glanced up at the TV . The golf was over , the news was on . That meant there 'd be NCAA basketball soon . I had a client , a bellyful of bourbon , and Tony 's lasagna coming . I stretched my legs and idly watched an elderly couple a few tables over . They were eating dinner in a silence punctuated only by quiet remarks and small gestures that dovetailed so perfectly they might have been choreographed . I 'd told Lydia I was coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I had n't said I 'd be meeting a client , that I might be working . I got up , bought a Mountain Eagle from the pile by the bar . Sipping my bourbon , I caught up on what had been happening since I 'd last come up . There was federal DOT money coming along and with it the state was planning to replace or rebuild three county roads . That was bad . Seven years ago they 'd replaced this stretch of 30 with a faster , straighter road on the other side of the valley . Now this was strictly a local road and most of the establishments along it had died slow , lonely deaths . Antonelli 's was one of the few still open . I glanced at the other lead stories . Appleseed Baby Foods was expanding . That was good . Appleseed was the only major employer in the county . Appleseed CEO Mark Sanderson smiled from a front-page photo . I sipped my bourbon , considered the photo . In the old days , pictures of the state senator 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included a shot of Mark Sanderson with his arm around the usually bare shoulders of his stunning wife , Lena . Then four years ago she 'd left him , just walked away . Consensus among the women in the county seemed to be that anyone married to Mark Sanderson would have considered that option , maybe much earlier than Lena Sanderson did , but Sanderson reported her to the county Sheriff and to the State Troopers as a missing person , made anguished televised pleas for her to come home , and waited . My professional opinion at the time was that the cops would come up empty and we 'd seen the last of her , and I was right . Looking at Sanderson 's round , smiling face now , it seemed to me he 'd come through the whole thing pretty well . I drank more bourbon , read on . New York State Electric and Gas had run an open meeting to get local comment on a natural gas pipeline they wanted to pull through the county . It would be heading down from Canada , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it was needed . Local comment pro had to do with promised jobs . Local comment con was about tearing up fields , fencing off pastureland , polluted water , damaged crops , and the chance of major explosions . Pro won , hands down . I lit a cigarette , turned the page . The Consolidated East girls ' basketball team had won the tri-county championship in a squeaker last Friday . There was a photo with this one too , sweaty , long-legged girls grinning at the camera , arms around each other 's shoulders . I imagined that picture fixed with magnets to refrigerator doors all around the county . I was onto the Police Blottera lot of DWIs , one marijuana arrestwhen Marie sashayed over , bringing silverware and a tall glass of ice . As she put them on my table the door swung open , letting a chill breeze push into the room . I looked over . Three men stepped inside , chuckling as though they 'd just exchanged a joke . They headed for the big table at the front . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocked a finger at Marie , winking . The features on the left side of his faceear , eye , eyebrowwere set a little higher than the ones on the right , and his nose was crooked . The other two men dropped themselves into chairs on either side of him . The big one was dark , with a thick , droopy mustache , wide shoulders , and an easy , friendly manner . The other was small and bony with bad skin and dead-brown hair . Marie , paling , looked unsurely to Tony . Tony shook his head , lifted the gate , stepped around the bar . " Who 's that ? " I asked Marie quietly . " Frank Grice , " she whispered , her eyes on Tony . " No kidding . " I knew that name : The trouble Jimmy Antonelli had been in last fall , the hole I 'd dug him out of , was because he 'd been dumping stolen cars for Frank Grice , cars Grice used to run dope from Miami to Albany . But Grice denied knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grice left the state when the sheriff picked Jimmy up and came back after my lawyer had gotten him out . I knew the name ; but this was the first time I 'd laid eyes on him . I ground out my cigarette and leaned forward in my chair as Tony walked to where the three men sat . " You ai n't welcome here , Frank . " He spoke low to Grice , ignoring the others . The line of his jaw was white . " Get out . " " What kind of a way is that to talk , Tony ? " Frank Grice smiled widely , spread his hands innocently , palms up . " We just came by for a drink . " " Drink somewhere else . " Grice did n't answer . He took a pack of cigarettes out of his overcoat , pulled one loose . The big guy flicked a gold lighter for him . Grice looked at the flame as if it were something new and interesting . Lighting the cigarette , he looked up at Tony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly , so softly I could n't hear it . Tony went a deep red ; I could n't hear his answer , either . Grice stood suddenly . The other two exchanged looks , then followed suit . Grice sauntered to the door , opened it , and held it open , smiling the whole time , his cigarette dangling from his cockeyed lips . Tony half turned , searching for Marie . " Keep an eye on things , " he growled . " I 'll be right back . " He slammed forward , past Grice , through the open door . Grice followed , his boys followed him , and the door swung shut behind them . Before the door closed I was out of my chair , moving swiftly past the bar and through the vinyl-padded doors that swung into the kitchen . Buzzing fluorescent lights , too bright , reflected off the stainless-steel counters . The room smelled of garlic and ammonia . A skinny kid up to his elbows in greasy water stared as I slipped out the kitchen door into the winter darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of the building , a cold wind pushing its way through my shirt . Three figuresTony , Grice , and the big , friendly manleaned close together in the middle of the parking lot ; a fourth , the little guy , stood by the bar 's front door . I worked my way in the shadows of parked cars . I could n't see Tony 's face , but his voice came to me , tight and gravelly . " You do n't get it , Frank . I want you outta here , damn fast . " " No , you do n't get it , Tony . " Grice 's voice still held a smile . " If I 'm thirsty , you pour me a drink . If I 'm hungry , you grill me a steak . That 's how it is now . " " Hell it is , " Tony spat . A nod from Grice , just a small movement of his misshapen head , and the big man slipped behind Tony like a shadow , pinned his arms as Grice smashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , groaning . The big man pulled him up . Grice laughed , rubbed his fist into the palm of his other hand . He stopped laughing suddenly as I slammed into him like a freight train , spreading him backwards across the rusted trunk of an old red Chevy . I backhanded him once across the mouth , just to slow him down ; then I sprang back , left him there . He was Tony 's . Tony tore himself out of the big man 's surprised grip and reached both hands for Grice , hauled him off the car while I grabbed the big man 's shoulder , spun him around . I threw my best punch into the middle of his mustache . He was n't any bigger than I was , and my best was n't bad , but it did n't faze him . He staggered back ; then , spreading his lips in a hungry smile , he launched himself at me . I sidestepped , drove a kick into his ribs . He stumbled ; I watched . Then something crashed into me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bony hands tightened around my throat , squeezing , shaking . A knee dug into my back . Gravel scraped the side of my face as I twisted , digging with my right foot , trying to shake off the little guy as my lungs began to strain for air . I groped at his hands pressing into my windpipe . My heart pounded , raced ; yellow and red explosions started behind my eyes . His breath rasped loudly in my ear . I had no breath at all . The world got smaller , darker . Closing on one finger of each choking hand I forced them back , my muscles only half obeying , beginning to tremble . I put everything into bending those two fingers ; at the last minute the hands loosened and I clawed them away from my throat . I sucked air loudly and twisted left , yanking on his right arm . He slipped from my back ; I drove my right elbow hard beside me into whatever was there . It landed solidly enough to send bolts of pain ricocheting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was n't the only one who noticed . I pulled away and got up on one knee and then the big man was back , with a fist the size of a bowling ball slamming into my chin . My head snapped back and I landed in a cold muddy puddle . I lay motionless , breathing hard . The big man leaned over me , relaxed and smiling , for a good look . When he was near enough that I could smell the stale coffee on his breath , I shot my arms out and grabbed his jacket , pulled my knee to my chest , shoved my foot into his gut . I straightened my leg and threw him away from me , and this time when he stumbled I was right there , three fast mean punches pounding his face and another sharp kick up under his ribs . He moaned and started to sag . I clenched my hands together and swung them like a hatchet down on the place where his neck joined his shoulder . At : first nothing happened ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , panting , and looked around . The little bony guy was standing now but he was a lot smaller than I was and he would n't try to take me again , not from the front where I could see him coming . I grinned so he 'd know I knew that . A loud , wordless sound came from behind me . I whipped around and saw Tony sitting on Frank Grice 's chest , his knees pinning Grice 's arms , his square fist thumping repeatedly into Grice 's already bloody face . " Tony ! " I yelled hoarsely . " Hey , Tony , that 's enough ! Come on , man , you 're going to kill him . " I pulled Tony back and off Grice , who groaned , rolled , and worked his way slowly to his feet . Tony struggled in my grip and I held him , not relaxing until he did . " All right ? " I asked , as his rocky muscles loosened under my hands . He nodded and I let him go . Grice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He lifted a hand to his face , cupping his nose , then moved the hand away . " You 'll pay for this , Tony , " he hissed . " This was stupid . And you " he turned his bloody face to me " whoever the hell you are , stay the fuck out of my way from now on . " " Aw , Frank , " I said , my voice still hoarse . " Why should Tony have all the fun ? " Something flared in Grice 's eyes . I suddenly noticed how cold I was , soaked with sweat and muddy water out here in the winter night . " Go on , Tony , " Grice said , still looking at me . " You bring in all the smartass muscle you want . It wo n't help you , Tony . " He coughed . " I do n't need no help , you son of a bitch , " Tony snarled , taking two fast steps toward Grice . From off to my right a voice like gears grinding said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . Ten feet away , the little bony guy was planted , legs spread apart , holding an automatic pointed at the center of Tony 's chest . Grice and Tony saw the gun the same time I did . Everyone froze , and for a long moment no one moved in the graveled lot under the blue-black sky , scattered now with more stars than a man could count , even in a long lifetime . My gun was pressed to my ribs under my flannel shirt , as out of reach as the stars . Then Grice laughed , a short , guttural sound , as of something being ripped in two . " Oh , Christ , Wally . What the hell is that for ? Put it away . Come on , let 's go . " He looked at me , then at Tony . " Next time , " he said . He turned sharply and walked to a big blue Ford , got in the front passenger door . The little guy hesitated , swore , then tucked the gun into his belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he was n't sure what day it was . Steering him to the car , he shoved him through the rear door , got behind the wheel , and sprayed gravel tearing out of the lot . Tony and I watched the red glow of their taillights vanish down 30 . " I do n't like your friends , " I told him . " You got Frank pissed off at you now , " he said . I fingered my left cheek carefully . It felt hot and sore . " You owe him , Tony ? " Tony turned to me . A lead curtain fell behind his eyes . " I do n't owe nobody , Smith . " He wiped his hand down his sweaty face . " You shoulda stayed out of it . " " Yeah . " I shrugged . " But I was hungry . Grice beats the shit out of you , I do n't get my lasagna . " We turned together , headed back toward the door . The ancient , pitted tin sign that read " Antonelli 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it swung in the wind . A smile cracked Tony 's face . " Sucker , " he said . " I 'm outta lasagna . " Two hours later , full of food , warmer , I turned my six-year-old Acura onto the dirt road that leads from 30 down to my cabin . The single lane was rutted and slippery , ruts that fit my tires exactly because almost no one drove that road but me . I parked in the flat field next to my place and spent a long time leaning on the car , looking at the stars through the black cross-hatching of tree branches . Inside , I turned on the lamp in the front room . The cedar-paneled walls soaked up most of the light , except where the glass frame of a photograph or drawing caught it , threw it back . When I bought the cabin it was n't winterized , so I 'd done that , insulating , finishing with cedar because it stood up well to damp and I liked the smell . I 'd reroofed , too , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weather was warm enough , I was going to replace the chimney . I shed my jacket , threw it over the broken-in reading chair by the window . As I turned , lamplight glinted on the child 's silver-framed photograph in the middle of the bookshelves . Days , weeks could go by without my looking at that picture , knowing it was there but feeling it only as a source of warmth , a hand on my shoulder . At those times I felt almost at peace ; sometimes I even thought I wanted to talk about it , although I did n't know with whom and I never tried . And then other times , like now , I 'd walk by too close , too close , and slice my heart on the sharp edges of Annie 's smile . Then the old pain would well up from where it lived in the hollows of my bones , and my eyes would grow hot . Ambushed by this aching , I would stare , as I did now , into this picture that never changed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so dangerous . Seven years ago I 'd packed away the pictures I 'd had in New York , and all her things . Her things were gone from here , too ; this was all that I had left , all I 'd kept , and I wondered why . But I knew . Because although the fresh prettiness of her face , the round cheeks and soft brown eyes and the wave in her hair , had all been her mother 's , that sharp , slanted smile was mine . And because , in all her nine years , I had never seen Annie afraid . I turned away from the picture . I poured myself some Maker 's Mark , left the bottle out . I drank , then flexed my hands , palms up , palms down ; they seemed all right , so I carried the bourbon to the piano bench and raised the cover off the keyboard of the old , battered Baldwin . I ran through a series of scales , the keys cold and smooth and hard under my fingers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaths , I started on the Mozart B Minor Adagio , trying out the phrasing that had been running around my head since morning . It did n't really work , but I played through the piece anyway , twice , and then went on to more Mozart , the Sonata in A Minor , which I 'd been playing a lot longer and played better . As I moved into it , the power and the tension in me grew until my whole body rang with them , with the exhilaration of balancing on a very narrow beam , barely controlling the lines of the music as they wove toward and away from each other , building , fading , stopping and not stopping , only my hands preventing chaos , creating just enough order for just enough time that the immense beauty of the music could exist here , now , in this dark , small place halfway down a wooded winter hillside , under a million stars .
