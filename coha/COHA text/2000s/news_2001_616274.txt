<p> With the steamy Gold Club trial swirling around him , U.S. District Judge Willis Hunt leans back in his chair , rests his chin on his hand and watches it all with a bemused expression . <p> Hunt , who possesses a wry wit and a good sense of humor , clearly is enjoying himself . <p> At least , some of the time . <p> There also are times when Hunt must lean on bickering lawyers , field a barrage of objections and try to keep control of a complicated racketeering trial with seven defendants and no end in sight . <p> Already , he has seen a lawyer jump onto a table and begin an impromptu strip tease . ( " Keep your feet on the floor , if you do n't mind , " Hunt told table-dancing attorney Bruce Harvey during opening statements . ) He conducted an in-chambers hearing with John A. " Junior " Gotti , ruling the jailed mob boss did not have to testify . And he has overseen testimony alleging sexual favors provided to sports stars such as Andruw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look forward to having a night out with him when this is all over , " chuckled Hunt 's former law partner , Sam Nunn . In 1994 , while a U.S. senator , Nunn recommended Hunt for the federal bench . <p> Hunt , 68 , is engaging without being dominating , in control without being on stage . The bow-tied judge walks a slow gait through the federal courthouse , his hands plunged deep into his pockets , a chortling fellow judge usually at his side . With a steady stream of one-liners , Hunt has brought levity to the Gold Club proceedings , bringing smiles to the faces of jurors and defendants alike . <p> Hunt has not consented to an interview during the ongoing sensational trial . When Hunt speaks from the bench the lawyers in the case hang on his every word , well aware that his decisions have the potential of crippling one side or the other . <p> Even though he has expressed skepticism with some aspects of the government 's case , Hunt has handed the prosecution some important victories . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion to prohibit testimony of sexual activities at the Buckhead nude dance bar that did not constitute allegations of prostitution . <p> And federal prosecutors in the case were grinning last month when Hunt issued a critical ruling in their favor . <p> He allowed " hearsay " testimony and surveillance tape evidence against club owner Steve Kaplan and co-defendant Michael DiLeonardo , both charged in an extortion scheme in the mid-1990s . <p> If Hunt had ruled the other way , the case against DiLeonardo , an alleged Gambino crime family captain , would have been gutted . Hunt may be confronted with yet another crucial decision if jailed mobster Craig Carlino continues his refusal to testify . <p> Federal prosecutors say Carlino can provide the necessary direct evidence to link DiLeonardo to the alleged extortion scheme . Without it , the defense is certain to ask Hunt to dismiss the charges against DiLeonardo at the end of the prosecution 's case . <p> Reining in hotshot lawyers <p> Throughout the proceedings , Hunt has tried to keep a tight leash on the dozen lawyers in the case , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He has lashed out at some for showing disrespect to the court , for needlessly prolonging the trial and for not trying to resolve disagreements among themselves before bringing the disputes to him . <p> When yet another argument broke out last month between prosecutors and defense attorneys , Hunt shut it down immediately . " I 'm so tired of lawyers making assumptions and accusations about other lawyers , it 's just nauseating , " Hunt said in exasperation , bringing sudden silence to the courtroom . <p> At the conclusion of opening statements , during which Harvey conducted his table dance and other defense lawyers lodged unusually pointed , personal attacks at prosecutors and federal agents , Hunt said he would tolerate no more of it . Such conduct , the judge told the attorneys , " had the purpose of subjecting the court to ridicule ( and ) could be characterized as disrespectful , as disruptive . " <p> Hunt has also expressed frustration with Assistant U.S. Attorney Art Leach for putting up evidence alleging wrongdoings that are not in the 129-page indictment . <p> Hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony by defendant Norbert Calder 's ex-girlfriend , who said Calder threatened to have her " whacked " if she ever testified against the club manager . <p> Even when he sided with the prosecution , Hunt turned to Leach and said , " I want as best we can to concentrate on the evidence the government has that relates directly to the charges . " <p> As appears to be his custom , Hunt does not like to make hasty decisions on complex objections and legal motions if he does n't have to . He often prefers to wait until the next court break  --  even the next day  --  so he has time to study the issue . <p> ' Unusually objective ' <p> Colleagues and the lawyers who practice before him say Hunt is hard to pigeonhole in terms of judicial ideology . In fact , both prosecutors and criminal defense attorneys privately gripe that Hunt too often rules for the other side . <p> " He is unusually objective and does not bring with him all sorts of preconceived baggage and philosophical positions , " said Nunn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the conclusions . " <p> Hunt , whose father grew up in Forsyth in Middle Georgia , did not decide to become a judge until the General Assembly created a new judicial district in Houston County . Then-Gov . Jimmy Carter called Hunt to the Capitol and encouraged him to accept the position . <p> Fifteen years later , Hunt was named to the state Supreme Court by Gov . Joe Frank Harris . Speaking recently at the swearing in of former colleague Norman Fletcher as chief justice , Hunt noted he , Fletcher and other judges were members of " the Joe Frank Harris gang " on the appellate court bench . <p> " I could say mob , but that would remind me of other work , " Hunt said , sparking laughter throughout a packed House chamber . <p> On the Supreme Court , Hunt participated in a number of landmark rulings . In 1989 , he authored the decision invalidating the city of Atlanta 's affirmative action business program . <p> That same year , Hunt joined in a decision that ruled in favor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nude dance clubs from selling alcohol . The ruling was handed down four years before Kaplan took control of the Buckhead strip club . <p> As a state court trial judge , Hunt " was scrupulously fair and , on a close ruling , would give the benefit of the doubt to the defendant , " said Atlanta lawyer Stephen Bright , director of the Southern Center for Human Rights . " As a justice of the Georgia Supreme Court , he was still very concerned about fairness but he took a more conservative approach to interpreting the law . " <p> Said Harold Clarke , a former state Supreme Court chief justice and colleague of Hunt 's , " He has a fine understanding of what the law is all about . He has a real concern for justice . " <p> Not long after Hunt was named the state Supreme Court 's chief justice , a federal judgeship vacancy opened and he accepted the nomination . <p> " I was really kind of surprised , " said Nunn , whose recommendation was endorsed by then-President Bill Clinton . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be around people . He likes the courtroom . " <p> As for the Gold Club case , Hunt seems to have developed a love-hate relationship with the trial , which has wrecked his court docket and kept him working at the courthouse for long hours on end . <p> He seems to relish being in the thick of the city 's most sensational trial and at times appears fascinated by some of the eye-popping testimony . <p> Joining in the laughs <p> Even when Harvey , the ponytailed attorney who has felt some of the brunt of Hunt 's frustrations , led government witness Amanda Pappas through a memorable cross-examination with a series of incredulous , rapid-fire questions that had jurors howling in laughter , Hunt snickered along with them , appearing to enjoy the show . <p> " This is the kind of trial that suits him well , even if it 's going to last so long , " said Hunt 's former law partner , Marvin Shoob , now a federal judge whose chambers are just down the hall from Hunt 's .
