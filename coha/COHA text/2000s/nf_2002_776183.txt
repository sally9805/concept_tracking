THE TRIAD OF // ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE // Two women and a child in a glade beside a spring . Beyond them , the varnished wilderness wherein bright birds cry . The child is chalk , Europe 's daughter . Her dusky attendants , a green Indian and a maroon slave . // The scene , from Democracy in America , is discovered by that most famous European traveler to the New World , Alexis de Tocqueville , aristocratic son of the Enlightenment , liberal , sickly , gray , violet , lacking the vigor of the experiment he has set himself to observe . // " I remember ... I was traveling through the forests which still cover the state of Alabama .... " // In a clearing , at some distance , an Indian woman appears first to Monsieur , followed by a " Negress , " holding by the hand " a little white girl of five or six years . " // The Indian : " A sort of barbarous luxury " set off her costume ; " rings of metal were hanging from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adorned with glass beads , fell loosely upon her shoulders .... " The Negress wore " squalid European garments . " // Such garments are motifs of de Tocqueville 's pathos . His description intends to show the African and the Indian doomed by history in corresponding but opposing ways . ( History is a coat cut only to the European. ) // " The young Indian , taking the child in her arms , lavished upon her such fond caresses as mothers give , while the Negress endeavored , by various little artifices , to attract the child 's attention .... " // The white child " displayed in her slightest gestures a consciousness of superiority that formed a strange contrast with her infantine weakness ; as if she received the attentions of her companions with a sort of condescension. " // Thus composed : The Indian . The Negress . The white child . // " ... In the picture that I have just been describing there was something peculiarly touching ; a bond of affection here united the oppressors with the oppressed , and the effort of Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance placed between them by prejudice and the laws . " // At Monsieur 's approach , this natural colloquy is broken . He becomes the agent of history . Seeing him , the Indian suddenly rises , " pushes the child roughly away and , giving Monsieur an angry look , plunges into the thicket . " // The Negress rests ; awaits de Tocqueville 's approach . // Neither response satisfies the European . The African , de Tocqueville writes , has lost the memory of ancestors , of custom and tongue ; the African has experienced degradation to his very soul , has become a true slave . " Violence made him a slave , and the habit of servitude gives him the thoughts and desires of a slave ; he admires his tyrants more than he hates them , and finds his joy and his pride in the servile imitation of those who oppress him . " // The bejeweled Indian , alternately , is " condemned ... to a wandering life , full of inexpressible sufferings , " because European interlopers have unbalanced the provender of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fondness for fable ) , whereas the Negro 's response to mistreatment is canine , the Indian 's is feline . " The Negro makes a thousand fruitless efforts to insinuate himself among men who repulse him .... " The Indian is filled with diffidence toward the white , " has his imagination inflated with the pretended nobility of his origin , and lives and dies in the midst of these dreams of pride . " The Indian refuses civilization ; the African slave is rendered unfit for it . // But cher Monsieur : You saw the Indian sitting beside the African on a drape of baize . They were easy together . The sight of them together does not lead you to wonder about a history in which you are not the narrator ? // These women are but parables of your interest in yourself . Rather than consider the nature of their intimacy , you are preoccupied alone with the meaning of your intrusion . You in your dusty leather boots , cobbled on the rue du Faubourg St.-Honor ? . Your tarnished silver snuffbox , your saddlebag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your soiled cambric . Vous-m ? me. // * * * // A boy named Buddy came up beside me in the schoolyard . I do n't remember what passed as prologue , but I do not forget what Buddy divulged to me : // If you 're white , you 're all right ; // If you 're brown , stick around ; // If you 're black , stand back . // It was as though Buddy had taken me to a mountaintop and shown me the way things lay in the city below . // In Sacramento , my brown was not halfway between black and white . On the leafy streets , on the east side of town , where my family lived , where Asians did not live , where Negroes did not live , my family 's Mexican shades passed as various . We did not pass " for " white ; my family passed among white , as in one of those old cartoons where Clarabelle the Cow goes shopping downtown and the mercantile class of dogs does not remark her exception . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a parallel universe of no possible admixture . And as I easily pass in these pages between being an American and regarding America from a distance . // As opposed , also , to the famous photograph of a girl in Little Rock in the pages of Life magazine . A black girl , no older than Alice , must pass alone through the looking glass . I remember wondering what my brown would have meant to Little Rock , how my brown would have withstood Little Rock . // In the Sacramento of the 1950s , it was as though White simply had n't had time enough to figure Brown out . It was a busy white time . Brown was like the skinny or fat kids left over after the team captains chose sides . " You take the rest "  --  my cue to wander away to the sidelines , to wander away . // In those years , I recall seeing a movie called The Defiant Ones . Two convicts  --  Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis  --  were shackled to each other . The movie did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's obvious question concerned privacy . By comparison , the pairing of the Lone Ranger and Tonto on television did occur to me racially . They were twin scourges , upholders of the law of the West . They were of compatible mind and they were of complementary skill  --  one sneaky , one full-charge . I noticed Tonto had no vocabulary but gravitas . Of more immediate interest to me was that each wore the symbol of his reserved emotion  --  the mask ; the hair in a bun . I did n't identify with Tonto any more than with Lone , or less . I identified with their pairing . // My parents had come from Mexico , a short road in my imagination . I felt myself as coming from a caramelized planet , an upside-down planet , pineapple-cratered . Though I was born here , I came from the other side of the looking glass , as did Alice , though not alone like Alice . Downtown I saw lots of brown people . Old men on benches . Winks from Filipinos . Sikhs who worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads wrapped in turbans . They were the rose men . They looked like roses . And the Palestinian communist bookie  --  entirely hearsay  --  who ran a tobacco store of pungent brownness ( the smell of rum-soaked cigars and cheap , cherry-scented pipe tobacco ) was himself as brown as a rolled cigar , but the more mysterious for having been born in Bethlehem . // And as we passed , we passed very close to the young man , close enough for me to smell him , something anointing his hair . He was the most beautiful man ( my first consciousness of the necessity for oxymoron ) I remember seeing as a boy . He wore a suit-vest over his naked torso . He wore a woman 's gold locket , with a dark red stone . He was petting a dog in the street . His pant knees were dirty . He smelled of coconut . He smiled brilliantly as we passed . // The missing tooth . // Heepsie , my mother whispered , taking me firmly by the hand , refusing his blazing notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gypsy 's mother  --  she must be his mother  --  dozens of times , sitting on a lawn chair outside her " office " on H Street , near my father 's work . There was a sign in the window beneath which she sat , a blank hand outlined in neon . She never sought or met my gaze . She looked Mexican to me . Not Mexican , my parents assured me . My brother said , Watch out , Ricky , she 's sitting there reading your tombstone . // A boy with a face as dark as mine , but several years older , stepped out of the crowd at the state fair to press a warm dime into my hand . Said nothing ; wanted nothing , apparently ; disappeared . His curious solemnity . But I interpreted  --  because I remember  --  the transaction as one of brown eyes . // A friend of mine , born and raised in Hong Kong , remembers attending British schools in Hong Kong ; remembers being constrained to learn about India . My friend learned nothing about China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curzon , Mother Ganga , mulligatawny , Mahatma Gandhi . The British obsession with India  --  as its existential opposite  --  seemed to my friend an affront to China . But surely there was also a kind of freedom in growing up without the Briton 's attention ? // My uncle from India was several times called " nigger " by strangers downtown in Sacramento . His daughter , Delia , forbade the rhyme I learned at school . Eenie , meenie , mynie , moe .... But her eyes softened as she corrected me and her mouth softened . // Brown is a bit of a cave in my memory . Like Delia 's eyes . // Lights up , then , on " Theme from a Summer Place , " on blue and gold and electric guitar strings . A decade on . I am staying for a month of summer in Laguna Beach with the family of my best friend , Larry Faherty . I am covered with a cool film of Sea &amp; Ski , as is Larry , though I suspect the insistence on this precaution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry 's mother is sitting on the deck with a neighbor , a red-faced woman with protuberant pale blue eyes , penciled eyebrows . The bug-eyed woman burbles into her tomato juice cocktail , " some niggers ... " ( ah , ah , ah , I can feel the hairs lift on the back of my neck ) " ... some niggers came onto the beach over the weekend ... " ( she glances at me while she is saying this ; her eyes are needles ; I am the camel ) " ... we let them know they were n't welcome . " It is not clear where I fit into her use of the first-person plural . Finally , however , my presence does not disturb her narrative . // Years later , the same story , a different summer  --  Columbia , South Carolina . A different storyteller  --  a lawyer in New York rehearses his famous anecdote , " The Hawaiian Stranger , " in three passages ; two tumblers of scotch . // 1 .

Of course a complement of young ladies has been invited as well , Sallys and Dorothys , women from town and from the college . // 2 . The day dawns golden . Syrup and mosquitoes . The hired help arrive first , disinterested capable hands . By and by , the young men arrive . Smiles , sweat rings , aftershave . The young women arrive also , in summer dresses . There will be games to put the gentlemen at ease . The women arrange themselves in wicker chairs , sip cool drinks and appraise the gentlemen from the shade of the porch . // Volleyball . // But , " South Carolina in summer ... , " the lawyer sighs , five decades later , rattling the ice in his glass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruits is a tall brown man with short-cropped hair .

"  --  and the sweat streaming down Mr. Cooke 's rib cage ; his flared nostrils . // ( Poor Mama. ) // Poor Narrator . Nevertheless , Mama keeps her stride , marching her fruit-bobbling sandals into the house and back out to the yard . More potato salad ? Key lime pie . Lemonade .

He is n't either a nigger , you mind yourself , he 's Hawaiian. ? " // Stories darken with time , some of them . // * * * // The first book by an African American I read was Carl T. Rowan 's memoir , Go South to Sorrow . I found it on the bookshelf at the back of my fifth-grade classroom , an adult book . I can remember the quality of the morning on which I read . It was a sunlit morning in January , a Saturday morning , cold , high , empty . I sat in a rectangle of sunlight , near the grate of the floor heater in the yellow bedroom . And as I read , I became aware of warmth and comfort and optimism . I was made aware of my comfort by the knowledge that others were not , are not , comforted . Carl Rowan at my age was not comforted . The sensation was pleasurable . // Only a few weeks ago , in the year in which I write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt the sadness one feels when a writer dies , a writer one claims as one 's own  --  as potent a sense of implication as for the loss of a body one has known . Over the years , I had seen Rowan on TV . He was not , of course he was not , the young man who had been with me by the heater  --  the photograph on the book jacket , the voice that spoke through my eyes . The muscles of my body must form the words and the chemicals of my comprehension must form the words , the windows , the doors , the Saturdays , the turning pages of another life , a life simultaneous with mine . // It is a kind of possession , reading . Willing the Other to abide in your present . His voice , mixed with sunlight , mixed with Saturday , mixed with my going to bed and then getting up , with the pattern and texture of the blanket , with the envelope from a telephone bill I used as a bookmark . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With my mother in the kitchen , with whatever happened that day and the next ; with clouds forming over the Central Valley , with the flannel shirt I wore , with what I liked for dinner , with what was playing at the Alhambra Theater . I remember Carl T. Rowan , in other words , as myself , as I was . Perhaps that is what one mourns. // * * * // In the Clunie Public Library in Sacramento , in those last years of a legally segregated America , there was no segregated shelf for Negro writers . Frederick Douglass on the same casement with Alexis de Tocqueville , Benjamin Franklin . Today , when our habit is willfully to confuse literature with sociology , with sorting , with trading in skins , we imagine the point of a " life " is to address some sort of numerical average , common obstacle or persecution . Here is a book " about " teenaged Chinese-American girls . So it is shelved . // I found this advice , the other day , in an essay by Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London journal , Thursday , March 1 , 1711 . " I have observed , that a reader seldom puruses a Book with Pleasure , ' til he knows the writer of it be a black or a fair Man , of a mild or cholerick Disposition , Married or a Bachelor , with other particulars of the like nature , that conduce very much to the right understanding of an Author . To gratifie this Curiosity , which is so natural to a Reader .... " // It is one thing to know your author  --  man or woman or gay or black or paraplegic or president . It is another thing to choose only man or woman or et cetera , as the only quality of voice empowered to address you , as the only class of sensibility or experience able to understand you , or that you are able to understand . // How a society orders its bookshelves is as telling as the books a society writes and reads .

The professor of Romance languages at Dresden , a convert to Protestantism , was tortured by the Nazis as a Jew  --  only that  --  a Jew . His book , published sixty years after the events it recounts , is shelved in my neighborhood bookstore as " Judaica . " There is no shelf for irony . // ( Continues ... ) //
