Chapter One The nurse was twenty-three years old , blonde , and nervous . This was only her second week at St. Dominic 's , one of London 's most exclusive private hospitals . Rock stars and television celebrities came here , she had been told . There were also VIPs from abroad . VIPs here meant very important patients . Even famous people get sick , and the ones who wanted to recover in five-star comfort chose St. Dominic 's . The surgeons and therapists were world-class . The hospital food was so good that some patients had been known to pretend they were ill so that they could enjoy it for a while longer . That evening , the nurse was making her way down a wide , brightly lit corridor , carrying a tray of medicines . She was wearing a freshly laundered white dress . Her name-d , meacher-was printed on a badge pinned to her uniform . Several of the junior doctors had already placed bets on which of them would persuade her to go out with them first . She stopped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello , " she said . " I 'm Diana Meacher . " " I 'm looking forward to meeting you too , " the boy in room nine replied . Alex Rider was sitting up in bed , reading a French textbook that he should have been studying at school . He was wearing pajamas that had fallen open at the neck and the nurse could just make out the bandages crisscrossing his chest . He was a very handsome boy , she thought . He had fair hair and serious brown eyes that looked as though they had seen too much . She knew that he was only fourteen , but he looked older . Pain had done that to him . Nurse Meacher had read his medical file and understood what he had been through . In truth , he should have been dead . Alex Rider had been hit by a bullet fired from a .22 rifle from a distance of almost 250 feet . The sniper had been aiming for his heart-and if the bullet had found its target , Alex would have had no chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A tiny movement had saved his life . As he had come out of MI6 's headquarters on Liverpool Street , he had stepped off the sidewalk , his right foot carrying his body down toward the level of the road . It was at that exact moment that the bullet had hit him , and instead of powering into his heart , it had entered his body half an inch higher , ricocheting off a rib and exiting horizontally under his left arm . The bullet had missed his vital heart structures , but even so , it had done plenty of damage , tearing through the subclavian artery , which carries blood over the top of the lung and into the arm . This was what Alex had felt when he was hit . As blood had poured out of the severed artery , filling the space between the lung and the thoracic cage , he had found himself unable to breathe . Alex could easily have died from shock or loss of blood . If he had been a man , he almost certainly would have . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adult . A young person 's artery will automatically shut itself down if cut-doctors ca n't explain how or why-and this will limit the amount of blood lost . Alex was unconscious , but he was still breathing , four minutes later , when the first ambulance arrived . There was n't much the paramedics could do : IV fluids , oxygen , and some gentle compression around the bullet 's point of entry . But that was enough . Alex had been rushed to St. Dominic 's , where surgeons had removed the bone fragments and put a graft on the artery . He had been in the operating room two and a half hours . And now he was looking almost as if nothing had happened . As the nurse came into the room , he closed the book and settled back into his pillows . Diana Meacher knew that this was his last night in the hospital . He had been here for ten days and tomorrow he was going home . She also knew that she was n't allowed to ask too many questions . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9/75958 RIDER/ALEX : SPECIAL STATUS ( MISO ) . NO UNAUTHORIZED VISITORS . NO PRESS . REFER ALL INQUIRIES TO DR . HAYWARD . It was all very strange . She had been told she would meet some interesting people at St. Dominic 's , and she had been required to sign a confidentiality clause before she began work . But she 'd never expected anything like this . MISO stood for Military Intelligence : Special Operations . But what was the secret service doing with a teenage boy ? How had Alex managed to get himself shot ? And why had there been two armed policemen sitting outside his room for the first four days of his stay ? Diana tried to push these thoughts out of her mind as she put the tray down . Maybe she should have stuck with the NHS . " How are you feeling ? " she asked . " I 'm fine , thanks . " " Looking forward to going home ? " " Yes . " Diana realized she was staring at Alex and turned her attention to the medicines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Can I get you something to help you sleep ? " " No , I 'm all right . " Alex shook his head and for a moment something flickered in his eyes . The pain in his chest had slowly faded , but he knew it would never leave him completely . He could feel it now , vague and distant , like a bad memory . " Would you like me to come back later ? " " No , it 's all right , thanks . " He smiled . " I do n't need anyone to tuck me in . " Diana blushed . " That 's not what I meant , " she said . " But if you need me , I 'll be just down the hall . You can call me anytime . " " I might do that . " The nurse picked up her tray and walked out of the room . She left behind the scent of her perfume-heather and spring flowers-in the air . Alex sniffed . It seemed to him that since his injury , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French book , then changed his mind . To hell with it , he thought . Irregular verbs could wait . It was his own future that concerned him more . He looked around at the neat , softly lit room that tried hard to pretend it belonged to an expensive hotel rather than a hospital . There was a TV on a table in the corner , operated by a remote control beside the bed . A window looked out over a wide north London street lined with trees . His room was on the second floor , one of about a dozen arranged in a ring around a bright and modern reception area . In the early days after his operation , there had been flowers everywhere , but Alex had asked for them to be taken away . They 'd reminded him of a funeral parlor and he had decided he preferred being alive . But there were still cards . He had received more than twenty and he 'd been surprised how many people had heard that he 'd been hurt-and how many had sent a card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the head ; one from Miss Bedfordshire , the school secretary ; and several from his friends . Tom Harris had sent him some photos taken on their trip to Venice and a note : They told us it 's appendercitis but I bet it is n't . Get well soon anyway . Tom was the only person at Brookland who knew the truth about Alex . Sabina Pleasure had somehow discovered he was in the hospital and had sent him a card from San Francisco . She was enjoying life in America but missed England , she said . She was hoping to come over for Christmas . Jack Starbright had sent him the biggest card in the room and had followed it up with chocolates , magazines , and energy drinks , visiting him twice a day . There was even a card from the prime minister 's office-although it seemed the prime minister had been too busy to sign it . And there had been cards from MI6 . One from Mrs. Jones , another from Alan Blunt ( a printed message with a single word-blunt-signed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a get-well card ) . Alex had been surprised and pleased to receive a card from Wolf , the soldier he had met while training with the SAS . The postmark showed it had been mailed in Baghdad . But his favorite had been sent by Smithers . On the front was a teddy bear . There was no message inside , but when Alex opened the card , the teddy bear 's eyes blinked and it began to talk . " Alex-very sorry to hear you 've been hurt . " The bear was speaking with Smithers ' voice . " Hope you get better soon , old chap . Just take it easy-I 'm sure you deserve a rest . Oh , and by the way , this card will self-destruct in five seconds . " Sure enough , to the horror of the nurses , the card had immediately burst into flames . As well as cards , there had been visitors . Mrs. Jones had been the first . Alex had only just come around after surgery when she appeared . He had never seen the deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was wearing a charcoal-gray raincoat , which hung open to reveal a dark suit underneath . Her hair was wet and raindrops glistened on her shoulders . " I do n't quite know what to say to you , Alex , " she began . She had n't asked him how he was . She would have already gotten that from the doctors . " What happened to you on Liverpool Street was an unforgivable lapse of security . Too many people know the location of our headquarters . We 're going to stop using the main entrance . It 's too dangerous . " Alex shifted uncomfortably in the bed but said nothing . " Your condition is stable . I ca n't tell you how relieved I am personally . When I heard you 'd been shot , I ... " She stopped herself . Her black eyes looked down , taking in the tubes and wires attached to the boy lying in front of her , feeding into his arm , nose , mouth , and stomach . " I know you ca n't talk now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brief . " You are safe here . We 've used St. Dominic 's before , and certain procedures are being followed . There are guards outside your room . Someone will be there twenty-four hours a day as long as necessary . " The shooting on Liverpool Street was reported in the press , but your name was kept out of it . Your age too . The sniper who fired at you had taken a position on the roof opposite . We 're still investigating how he managed to get up there without being detected-and I 'm afraid we 've been unable to find him . But right now , your safety is our primary concern . We can talk to Scorpia . As you know , we 've had dealings with them in the past . I 'm sure I can persuade them to leave you alone . You destroyed their operation , Alex , and they punished you . But enough is enough . " She stopped . Alex 's heart monitor pulsed softly in the dim light . " Please try not to think too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything you 've been through-Scorpia , your father ... I will never forgive myself for what happened . I sometimes think it was wrong of us ever to get you involved in the first place . But we can talk about that another time . " Alex was too weak to reply . He watched as Mrs. Jones got up and left , and he guessed that Scorpia must have decided to leave him alone , because a few days later the armed guards outside his room quietly disappeared . And now , in just over twelve hours , he would be out of here too . Jack had already been planning the weeks ahead . She wanted to take him on vacation to Florida or perhaps the Caribbean . It was October and the summer was definitely over , leaves falling and cold breezes coming in with the night . Jack wanted Alex to rest and regain his strength in the sun-but secretly he was n't so sure . He picked up the textbook again . He never thought he 'd hear himself say this , but the truth was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to be ordinary again . Scorpia had sent him a simple , unforgettable message . Being a spy could get him killed . Irregular verbs were less dangerous . There was a movement at the door and a boy looked in . " Hi , Alex . " The boy had a strange accent-Eastern European , possibly Russian . He was fourteen , with short blond hair and light blue eyes . His face was thin , his skin pale . He was wearing pajamas and a large dressing gown , which made him seem smaller than he was . He was staying in the room next door to Alex and really had been treated for appendicitis , with complications . His name was Paul Drevin-the surname was somehow familiar-but Alex did n't know anything more about him . The two of them had spoken briefly a few times . They were nearly the same age , and the only teenagers on the corridor . Alex raised a hand in greeting . " Hi . " " I hear you 're getting out of here tomorrow , " Paul said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another day , worst luck . " He hovered in the doorway . He seemed to want to come in , but at the same time something held him back . " I 'll be glad to leave , " he admitted . " I want to go home . " " Where is home ? " Alex asked . " I 'm not sure . " Paul was completely serious . " We live in London a lot of the time . But my father 's always moving . Moscow , New York , the South of France ... he 's been too busy even to come in and see me . And we have so many houses , I sometimes wonder which is my home . " " Where do you go to school ? " Alex had picked up on the mention of Moscow and assumed that Paul must be Russian . " I do n't go to school ; I have tutors . " Paul shrugged . " It 's difficult . My life 's sort of weird , because of my father . Because of everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before me . Good luck . " " Thanks . " Paul hesitated a fraction longer , then left . Alex gazed thoughtfully at the empty doorway . Perhaps his father was some sort of politician or banker . On the few occasions they had spoken , he 'd gotten the impression that the other boy was friendless . He wondered how many kids were admitted into this hospital who had fathers willing to spend thousands to make them better , but who had no time to visit them while they were there . It was nine o'clock . Alex flicked through the television channels , but there was nothing on . He wished now that he had accepted the sleeping pill from the nurse . A little sip of water and he would have been out for the night . And out of the hospital the next day . Alex was looking forward to that more than anything . He needed to start his life again . He watched half an hour of a comedy that did n't make him laugh . Then he switched off the television , turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one last time . He rather wished Diana Meacher had come back to see him . Briefly he remembered the scent of her perfume . And then he was asleep . But not for long . The next thing Alex knew , it was half past twelve . There was a clock beside the bed , its numerals glowing in the dark . He woke up reluctantly , trying to climb back down into the pit from which he had come . The truth was , it was difficult to sleep when he had done nothing to make him tired . All day he 'd been lying there , breathing in the clean , conditioned atmosphere that at St. Dominic 's passed for air . He lay in the semidarkness , wondering what to do . Then he got up and slipped into his dressing gown . This was the worst thing about being in the hospital . There was no way out , nowhere to go . Alex could n't get used to it . Every night for a week , he 'd woken up at about the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and escape from the sterile box that was his room . He wanted to be outside . He needed the smell of London , the noise of the traffic , the feeling that he still belonged to the real world . He put on a pair of slippers and went out . The lights had been dimmed , casting no more than a discreet glow outside his room . There was a computer screen gleaming behind the nurses ' station but no sign of Diana Meacher or anyone else . Alex took a step forward . There are few places more silent than a hospital in the middle of the night and he felt almost afraid to move , as though he were breaking some sort of unwritten law between the healthy and the sick . But he knew he would just lie awake for hours if he stayed in bed . He had nothing to worry about . Mrs. Jones was certain that Scorpia was no longer a threat . He was almost tempted to leave the hospital and catch the night bus home . Of course , that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far . But he was still determined to reach the main reception with its sliding glass doors and-just beyond-a real street with people and cars and noise and dirt . By day , three receptionists answered the phones and dealt with inquiries . After eight o'clock there was just one . Alex had already met him-a cheerful Irishman named Conor Hackett . The two of them had quickly become friends . Conor was sixty-five and had spent most of his life in Dublin . He 'd taken this job to help support his nine grandchildren . After they 'd talked awhile , Alex had persuaded Conor to let him go outside , and he had spent a happy fifteen minutes on the sidewalk in front of the main entrance , watching the passing traffic and breathing in the night air . He would do the same again now . Maybe he could stretch it to half an hour . Conor would complain ; he would threaten to call the nurse . But Alex was sure he would let him have his way .
