Flchette Follies When the accident occurred , George Wissone was returning from an errand . Among the things he 'd bought was a plastic container of paper clips that flew open when he slammed on the brake . Paper clips fell from his hair as he opened the door to see what damage he 'd done to the car he 'd rear-ended . He winced and avoided looking at the front fender of his own rental car . Most of all , he wished no one to be hurt . He was surprised to see blood between his thumb and first finger , though he had felt the key 's serrated edge as he 'd pulled it clumsily from the ignition . Unlike him to do things clumsily , but there would be plenty of time to introspect later . The woman did , indeed , seem to be hurt . Being hit from behind at a red light was the last thing she needed , so she had dropped her head to her hands , which tightly clutched the top of the wheel . She was late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called from England to say that he would not be coming home for Christmas . So much for her excuse not to work both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day at the nursing home . She finally met his eyes , but only for a second , after deciding he was not really injured . She was a round-faced woman with broad shoulders and a nervous-seeming overbite . Cars were swerving around them . Soon  --  when he got to know Charlottesville ( to the extent that he got to know any place )  --  he would curse the unmannerly drivers of rush hour like everyone else . He should not have taken a double dose of Contac and then operated " heavy machinery "  --  such as a Geo Metro could be dignified as representing " heavy machinery . " She sat there , jaw set , not opening the door tostep out . He looked back at his car and saw that he had left the door ajar . It was in danger of being sideswiped by irritated motorists , one of whom had the nerve to hit the horn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Would n't you know it , " the woman muttered . " Are you hurt ? " " I 'm awfully sorry , " he said . " I was n't thinking . " " Beer for lunch ? " she said . " Did you think about domestic , or no : you 'd go for imported , right ? " " What ? " The next car that swerved toward them was a police car . He saw a German shepherd in the back . A dog he 'd never liked , along with Dobermans . Of course , he did n't like pit bulls , either . He had been driving west . The sun , which gave no heat , burned his eyes . He tried to wince it away , fixing his gaze on the police car 's blue light as it pulled in behind his car . Did German shepherds have blue eyes ? As a boy he 'd had a mutt that was part shepherd : a dog with one blue-flecked eye , the other brown . He had not had beer at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort for more than four years . Another car with a dog inside passed . The dog eyed the scene , moving in the backseat . " My job . " The woman had finally left her car to talk to the policeman . Apparently she had the habit of loudly articulating the last words of sentences . " Does n't he have a business card , so we can talk about this later ? " she said , as if he could n't answer for himself . " He plowed into me when I was stopped for the light . " She was holding her business card between two fingers , as if it were usually clipped there . The cop reached out and took it . She said , " I think this man has been drinking . " " That hand okay ? " the cop said , looking at the smear of blood on his jacket pocket . He had said something to the woman , first , but George had n't heard it . Even she might not have understood , the wind had come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung wind chimes . Metal tinkled like toy swords . " People overreact to blood , " the woman said . " Blood , and tears . If it 's a new mother , she overreacts to shit . " The cop turned his full attention to the woman , taking one step forward with a quizzical expression . The cop was holding both of their licenses . He seemed to take George 's word for the fact that he was driving a rental car , that the registration was in the glove compartment . George supposed you could tell a car was a rental from the license , though it had been so long since he 'd rented a car , he was n't sure about that . In any case , the cop obviously had no intention of seeing whether he could walk a straight line . " I do n't want to make more of this than necessary , " the cop said to the woman . " No need to waste time we do n't got . " He watched silently as the cop returned the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his insurance company . Surely he had an insurance company , though that would be a bit of trivia he 'd never know . There were many things it was pleasant not to have to think about . On the other hand , it would have been nice to have some input about what rental car had been reserved for him . The cop unwrapped some gum and folded it over , placing it in his mouth . He looked at both of them . It was obvious he knew neither would like a stick . The driver of the other car was Nancy Gregerson  --  Gregerson having been her married name . Her maiden name , not resumed after the divorce , was Shifflett . The town was full of Shiffletts , so why add to their ranks ? She had been divorced for twenty years , and her last name no longer reminded her of Edward Gregerson . A couple of Beatles songs did , and the way the corners of her son 's mouth tightened sometimes brought his face to mind , but his last name ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Late to work , " and she realized she was being obnoxious , but could n't help herself . She put in a full shift at Dolly Madison House without taking a break ( Jenny , the nurses ' aide , was six months pregnant ; she let her have the time ) . By the time an hour had passed , she felt slightly chagrined that she 'd been so unkind to the man who 'd hit her . Her instincts about who 'd been drinking and who had n't were n't always right ; she tended to overestimate how many people were alcohol dependent . They made the staff watch so many films about drunks and smokers  --  how could she think otherwise ? One recent film had been a very unfunny cartoon , and an equally humorless visiting cardiologist had pointed a laser pen at a drunken elephant on the screen as if he were making rounds with his interns and an elephant just happened to be sprawled in the bed , like any other patient . She punched out , sorry that her son would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who expected too much from his ability to draw recognizable figures . He had been painting in London for almost two years . For a while he had lived with two other would-be painters , but as often happened in his life , they decamped and went elsewhere . One had moved to a room in someone 's house . The other moved in with his girlfriend . Was that it ? In any case , Nicky was there , stuck with the rent . When he 'd flown in to Dulles the year before , he 'd stayed only three days , and he 'd spent the entire time brooding about his former girlfriend , who 'd moved to Lexington . Should he visit her ? Should he not ? Sitting in Nancy 's favorite chair , his big feet in his Doc Martens dirtying her little needlepoint footstool as he mentally plucked the anxiety daisy . Though she alternated among several routes home , this evening she decided to take the same road on which she 'd been involved in the accident earlier . There was a spritz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass for a second before it melted . The road curved , and she realized she 'd been following a van too closely . Icy road , tailgating ... she might plow into somebody herself , and would n't that be ironic . An SUV sat at the curb , and just past it a tree , lit by a floodlight above it . She turned in to a driveway and walked back to where she 'd been . She saw something glinting in the street , but since she 'd inspected her own car carefully , she did n't much care what had broken on his . She remembered it as a crummy little car , and thought that was about right : that was what he 'd be driving . She bent to see what sparkled on the asphalt , and saw paper clips scattered there . She picked up one but left the others ; they would not be a clue for her insurance company . In fact , they seemed so ordinary that she felt even sorrier that she had been so unkind to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a little something was out of place , all the time . Like one of the old ladies on floor three : you 'd find a glove pulled onto one of their feet , their shoe somewhere across the room . The poinsettia 's red leaves on the floor , as if a cat had attacked a cardinal . At lunch , you might see a lipstick tube dropped on their plate , shiny among the vegetables , relinquished , at last , from their fist , or even a snapshot , disguised in the folds of a skirt , pulled out and placed on the food like a trump card . She stopped at a convenience store for Taster 's Choice and milk . A young man in front of her reminded her of her son : slouched into his own body , big black motorcycle boots , ugly tattoo of some bird that could n't become extinct soon enough etched on his forearm . He looked through her as he pocketed his change and walked past . He was someone 's son  --  one who either would or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
