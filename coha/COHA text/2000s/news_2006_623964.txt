<p> The problem with showhouses tends to be right there in the name : They 're houses , not homes , that are just for show . Even those that ignite bidding wars leave many visitors mystified as to who would want to clutter that kitchen and trample that carpet . <p> Then last week at the International Builders ' Show in Orlando , Fla. , Reality House 2006 opened its ample and storm-proof front door to a house built for success , not excess , and pulled the rug right out from under the ritzy New American Home across town . <p> The New American Home was all done up in the latest finery from the building industry to provide a second or third address for a couple of wealthy Baby Boomers . The Reality House came dressed in research to meet the everyday needs of the American family . <p> Market Scape Research went into the homes of eight families in each of three markets to videotape the way they were living in the new houses they 'd bought within the past year . <p> Into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researcher 's conclusions , and to the drawing board went the architects . Issa Homes managed to navigate the jungle of contributing sponsors and build a house Francis Issa said is like no other ; designer Michelle Reich decorated with a light touch , and Builder and Home magazines documented the project . <p> Here 's how the experts met the demands of modern family life : <p> The reality is that we 're messy , said the research , and we 've got stuff everywhere : The firm , partnering with Timberlake cabinetry , built in storage galore , so much that the residents might need a database to track where they 've put all their stuff . Often the cabinets , most of them in glazed maple , create reading nooks or window seats . <p> The reality is that we drop our keys , our cell phones , our mail on the kitchen island when we walk in the house , the research said : The firm created Carson Looney 's pride and joy , a " drop-off area " that 's a built-in bench and storage nook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that we do n't want to put Grandma out in some little backyard hut , said the research , because she 's part of the household ( even though she needs to get away from us sometimes ) : Answer , a first-floor second master suite ( " second-generation suite , " Looney calls it ) complete with a fridge and microwave that will ensconce Grandma or the nanny or guests in proximate privacy . <p> The reality is , our garages are loaded with stuff , said the research , and we 're especially worried about stuff exploding in there : The architects put a potting shed/art studio/stuff-stashing site out back . <p> The reality is that we have pets , said the research , that are part of the family , except when anti-pet guests come over : A Dutch door in the laundry room can confine Fido while still letting him in on the action , and we can wash him in the shower that 's just inside the door to his doggie-doo part of the backyard . <p> The reality is that one or more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research said : An office with floor-to-ceiling cabinets and counter space for two has places for computers , printers , wrapping paper , bells and whistles . <p> The reality is that our great rooms , with their 22-foot vaulted ceilings , amplify noise and waste energy , the research said : The architects brought the ceilings down to a still-lofty 10 feet and designated various spaces in the great room with coves and columns . <p> And the reality is that as much as we like being together , the research said , we all want our space : Looney and co-pencils answered with his-and-hers , not double , vanities in the master bath , two entrances to the master suite , and activity spaces in the two bedrooms designed and decorated for children . <p> The house also addressed the raging trend toward living outdoors with a massive pool terrace in Boral Bricks red clay pavers that has an outdoor kitchen and fireplace and is accessible from most of the rooms on the first floor of the house . There 's another sizable terrace off the master-master bedroom upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of a small lake . <p> All of this behind a 1920s Arts &; Crafts-era facade that would blend as tastefully into the Oakland Hills as it does in Celebration , the Neo-Traditional and New Urbanist city built 11 years ago by Disney . Reality House covers 6,000 square feet ( 5,400 before a late decision to turn the attic over the garage into a bonus room ) and carries an asking price of $2.5 million , but the priceless concepts carry value for builders in any market . <p> " These attitudes cut across all price points , " said Builder editorial director Boyce Thompson . <p> Which is n't to say that the Reality House meets every fantasy . A few things about the house seemed excessive , such as the three kitchens . Though the one off the formal dining room made perfect sense as a place to store and then wash the good china and chill and serve the wine , there would seem to be little use for the galley kitchen that connected it to the main kitchen . <p> The master bath had four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , like the New American Home , this house had three laundry stations . How many windows it had , only Pella knows for sure . <p> Some things need serious reconsideration  --  for instance , the extra activity nooks in the designated children 's bedrooms . Of course , the research showed that kids want more privacy ; there 's plenty of other research that shows kids need more supervision . The nook in the boy 's bedroom was so tucked away yet so inviting , one can imagine Junior whiling away the hours here unnoticed , at the expense of chores and family time . <p> Other things seem just a little off . For instance , in the master of masters , a large flat-screen TV rises out of the foot of the bed , obliterating the expansive lake view from the sheets : Imagine the discord that might also arise with the TV . And opposite the foot of the bed in both masters , the architects created a nook just about wide enough for a sofa . Unfortunately , it is also only about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to face into the room instead of out at that lovely lake view . <p> " It 's tough to nail it all perfectly , " observed Mark Jones , one of the architects . <p> True enough , so the experts behind the New American Home probably deserve to be cut some slack . WCI Architecture teamed with Hannigan Homes and scores of product partners  --  always a challenge for showhouse builders , coordinating the latest this with the futuristic that in a cohesive design  --  on a second home for the Baby Boomer retiree under 10,023 square feet of roof . ( WCI , which does 30 percent of its business in second homes , calls this category of buyer " splitters , " and says they are the reason new construction is booming in Truckee . ) <p> The place is easy on the eyes , with a Caribbean-style exterior and an outdoor-oriented setting between two lakes , but , perhaps inevitably , feels ostentatious and overscale , with a two-story-high entrance hall and two-story-high office . It has a billiard room , a home theater and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because walking the length of the house is exercise enough . <p> But the house has been Energy-Star rated , a rare honor for a place this size , and uses 61 percent less energy for heating and cooling and 50 percent less to heat water than similar-size homes in the Lake Burden climate , the builders say . <p> At least the New American Home , on the market for $5.3 million , says " green can be grand , " which is perhaps a more potent statement than the " you can live here " message from the Reality House . But chalk up the greatest accomplishment to Reality House : It listened . <p> Resources <p> For floor plans and more information , including product and sponsor credits , about the two showhouses , visit www.realityhouse2006.com and www.tnah.com.  --  S.F.
