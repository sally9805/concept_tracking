Section : WHO 'S NEXT <p> MOWAFFAK AL-RUBAIE : Soft-spoken , bespectacled and courtly , this member of the Iraqi Governing Council once served as the international spokesman for a feared terrorist group . Now he 's a key player in the New Iraq . <p> He was there , one of only four Iraqi dignitaries present , when President George W. Bush dropped in at Baghdad airport for Thanksgiving turkey with the troops . He was there again , a few weeks later , when Saddam Hussein , freshly dragged from a " spider hole " near Tikrit , was forced to confront a few men who 'd fought against him for decades . If you look closely , in fact , he seems to be just about everywhere in the New Iraq . Yet Mowaffak al-Rubaie is often overlooked , like a Mr. Cellophane , on press rosters of Iraq 's rising stars . <p> His problem : he 's hard to categorize . He 's not a Kurdish nationalist leader with guerrilla followers in colorful clothes . Or a longtime CIA asset . Or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swindler who talked his way to the hearts of American neoconservatives . So from the outside , al-Rubaie tends to blend in with the other mostly faceless characters in the 25-member Iraqi Governing Council that was appointed last summer by the United States . Yet al-Rubaie epitomizes , in fact , the subtle complexities of Iraq 's emerging politics . He 's a critical link to key members of Iraq 's powerful Shiite clergy : Grand Ayatollah Hussein al-Sadr in Baghdad and Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani in Najaf , the holiest city in Iraq . Without the tacit support of the Shiites , who make up a 60 percent majority of the population and look to these ayatollahs for guidance , the American occupation of Iraq would be unsustainable . <p> Soft-spoken , bearded , bespectacled and courtly , al-Rubaie , 55 , was the international spokesman for one of the most feared terrorist organizations in the Middle East during the 1980s , the Iraqi Dawa Party . But he 's also a prosperous British-educated physician . He practiced medicine in London for the better part of three decades . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by his Anglicized name , Mow Baker . ) While pious , he is also perfectly comfortable in secular Western society . " Shall we dine and not wine ? " he used to joke with guests when inviting them to dinner at his house . And while Western policies toward Iraq went through many changes , al-Rubaie 's goal was always consistent : the overthrow of Saddam Hussein . <p> American officials in Iraq are well aware of al-Rubaie 's ability to navigate in both worlds ; when President Bush landed in Baghdad for Thanksgiving dinner , clearly he 'd been briefed . As al-Rubaie remembers their encounter , the president pointed at him and said , " Dr. al-Rubaie , I want you to convey this message to Mr. Sistani . Tell him that I pray to the same god he prays to ... Tell Sistani I have nothing but praise for your religion . I have many millions of Muslims in my country back home . " <p> Ayatollah Sistani in Najaf , it should be noted , tolerates the American presence in Iraq , but does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to the Americans , but as one political operative at the Coalition Provisional Authority explained , the ayatollah in Baghdad " let it be known that Mowaffak is the dearest of all to his heart . " <p> " Access is power , " says the same official , " and if you have access at the Oval Office and in Najaf , that 's not bad . " <p> When al-Rubaie met the captured Saddam this month , his first question was why the dictator murdered two revered ayatollahs from the al-Sadr family . Saddam responded with a coarse joke . Al-Rubaie has since led the call to put Saddam on trial in a matter of weeks . While it 's unlikely the Americans will bend to that particular demand , many others will surely follow , probably growing more contentious as occupied Iraq tries to become , truly , liberated Iraq . And al-Rubaie is likely to be at the forefront of political developments . <p> But what kind of Iraq does he envision ? Would it be a sort of postmodern version of Khomeini 's Iran ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come full circle . In Algeria and Sudan , for example , " we saw a tyranny in the name of Islam , " he says . " This is very dangerous  --  politicizing religion or religicizing politics . " In purely practical terms , al-Rubaie explains , Iraq is " like a bunch of flowers . There are Sunnis here , Christians , Muslims , Turkomans and Orthodox , Kurds , Assyrian . So what religion do you impose ? The diversity of Iraqi society should dictate democracy and decentralization . That 's the alternative vision to Saddam 's tyranny of fear . " <p> In the meantime , like most Iraqis , he wants to see his countrymen taking a greater role in bringing order to their homeland , while the Coalition forces step to the rear , ready to back up the regime , but interacting as little as possible with the people . " The Americans do n't understand the culture , the different religions , the psychology , " al-Rubaie says as he sits in his sparsely furnished office in the building that houses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , he was given a full body search by American soldiers as he tried to enter the building  --  searched right down to the soles of his shoes . " This is humiliation in the eyes of our people , " he says in frustration . Yet even while lobbying for greater Iraqi involvement in security matters , he warns that Washington should n't rush Iraqis into accepting full sovereignty : " People are not ready . People have not voted here for more than 50 years . " Al-Rubaie speaks of the " Baathist virus " implanted by Saddam Hussein " in the software upstairs . " " We need to rewrite the software , " he says . " We need to rehabilitate the Iraqi people . This will take a long time . " <p> And meanwhile al-Rubaie continues building his own personal constituency . Last summer the holy city of Karbala was draped with banners extolling his virtues . His clan , the al-Rubaie , is large and powerful , and he 's worked hard to make sure he keeps its support . But politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Council has been shot dead ; the driver of another member was killed when American soldiers opened fire on his car . And then there was the October attack on the Baghdad Hotel , when al-Rubaie himself was injured . Does he feel endangered ? " I 'm not afraid to die , " he says , smiling . " Thank goodness I believe in the hereafter . So I am ready to go . " If he survives  --  and that 's a big if for any Iraqi politician  --  he could also be ready to rule . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Al-Rubaie on the job , Nov. 30 , 2003 <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : ' Convey This Message ' : Bush visits the troops , the ubiquitous al-Rubaie last August in Baghdad <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Christian Caryl and Christopher Dickey <p>
