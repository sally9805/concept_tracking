They still do n't believe her , and why should they , but it 's always the <br> same , it is  --  this same dream , darkness , heat , and the song , the same <br> song , same deafening beat . <br> Driving . Midnight . Still driving ; their beacon through the desert , <br> flashing lights , pink and green neon from the roadhouse roof . Eddie <br> cruises the parking lot . He parks on the farthest side , in shadows . <br> Tired and hungry , she slips after him into the reek of beery dust . It <br> coats the bar top , the windows , the dimly lit jukebox blasting that song <br> " Gim me Some Lovin ' " over and over and over again . Their luck 's <br> about to change , Eddie says . He feeds quarters into the jukebox , the <br> last of their money  --  hers , mostly . <br> Sitting behind them , the only other customer , a skinny man , grimy <br> shirt , loosened tie , jacket bunched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bobs over the table . Her own face floats in the murky bar mirror , outlined <br> in blinking red Christmas bulbs . This inferno of caged heat <br> pulsates between the sagging ceiling and gritty plank floor . A dream , <br> nothing 's real . The blur of overhead fan blades dizzies her . <br> Elbows sticking to the bar , she sips a rum and Coke ; only seventeen , <br> but as long as she keeps sliding the drink back in front of Eddie , <br> the skinny bartender could care . He ignores her , acts like she 's not <br> even here . She grabs another cherry , and Eddie winks in the mirror . <br> Their last meal , hamburgers  --  this morning ; " poor man 's brunch , " <br> Eddie said . Every time the bartender looks away , she grabs more , cherries , <br> olives , slimy little cocktail onions , shoves them into her mouth , <br> swiveling on the stool to hide her ravenous chewing . They have <br> devoured the bowl of pretzels . After warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rum Eddie wants . The more he drinks the sharper he grows , pale eyes <br> glinting , voice roughening , snagging on her soft parts , moving deep <br> inside , his hard running feet , tingling through her legs and thighs , <br> belly and heart , pounding with the music . She covers her grin . Drinking <br> makes her tired and silly , the least little thing , she 's laughing so <br> hard she ca n't stop . Or crying . Today , mostly crying . <br> Another quarter , that song again . <br> Eddie pauses by the table . The man 's head jerks up . Laughing , <br> Eddie leans close , back muscles rippling through his damp T-shirt . <br> Blond , tanned , blue eyes , dimples , oh God . Her eyes burn . Eddie 's <br> gesturing . The man glances back , and she looks away . Now Eddie 's <br> hand is soft on her thigh , one finger stroking flesh high , high between <br> her legs . Her eyes close as his mouth brushes her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear . <br> She 's known him forever , it seems through the haze of longing . But <br> only a summer month before she was a chambermaid at the Clayborne <br> Hotel in Lake George that drizzly day when he drove up in the yellow <br> Mustang , top down , his arm over the back of the seat . " Hey , pretty <br> girl , " he called as she dragged along the gravel path in her baggy green <br> uniform , arms loaded with buckets , scrub brushes , and mop . " I 've <br> come to rescue you . " <br> It was her last summer of high school . Six years older , he knew so <br> much about life . After Yale , he 'd invested the ten-thousand-dollar <br> graduation gift from his wealthy grandfather in an international grain <br> brokerage company . In just three months ' time he made a quarter of a <br> million dollars . Then came the sharks who , with a taste of his blood , <br> wanted more . " Bad deals and blind faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <br> There was a great job in L.A. , a friend of his grandfather 's . He <br> just had to get there . <br> Tall with boyish hips , still almost flat-chested , but she drove him <br> crazy , Eddie said . " You 're the first one , " he whispered in his bleak <br> room , rented by the night . Too busy studying , he 'd never had a social <br> life . He liked to turn all the lights on while undressing her . <br> Eyes closed , her arm over her face , trembling , craving the stasis of <br> sleep while he stroked her feet , traced each bone in her rib cage , murmuring , <br> " There , pretty girl , there , there . " <br> Eleven when her father died . Her mother , by necessity , stern , a <br> schoolteacher who , after having raised her older daughter Carol to a <br> college-educated , newly wed nurse , was bewildered by this younger <br> child 's moody volatility . <br> One day after work Eddie came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't hold the job much longer . Did she want to come ? Yes or no . <br> Time was running out . He had another one of his terrible headaches . <br> She called from the road , cringing as her mother demanded to <br> speak with this Eddie she 'd never even heard of , much less met . Smiling , <br> he took the phone and apologized for their abrupt departure , but <br> she could rest assured her daughter was in safe hands . <br> " I love her , Mrs. Trimble . And I 'm going to take care of her . Always . <br> I promise . All we want is your blessing . " <br> " My blessing ! " her mother shrieked across the line . " My blessing ! <br> All you 'll get from me is a warrant for your arrest ! " <br> Watching a baseball game at the end of the bar , the bartender <br> hunches close to the snowy black-and-white TV screen . Another quarter . <br> That song again . Eddie 's song . Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oniony bile searing her throat . Her sweaty thighs <br> stick to the brittle plastic . Eddie 's arm falls , heavy on her shoulders . <br> His tongue drags over her ear . She ca n't believe what he wants . <br> Turning from the table , the man watches with a wet , imploring grin . <br> " Like a joke . You 'll see . C'mere . Feel . Feel , can you feel that ? " <br> Eddie asks , pressing against her leg . " You know where that belongs . <br> You know . You know . . . " His moan burns her ear . " Just a little , that 's <br> all , to get us outta here . " <br> " No . . . no , " she whispers , curling her neck away from his face . It <br> takes all her effort . <br> " Look at him . " With Eddie 's contemptuous gesture , the leering <br> man waves . " Flashing that roll , just begging for it , and us hungry . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> " No . " <br> " Just get him outside , that 's all I ask . " <br> " No . No , Eddie ! " <br> They 'll be doing the drunk a favor , Eddie says , smiling . The man <br> tries to wink back , instead both eyes close . " His money 's gon na be a <br> whole lot better spent feeding us than on that . " <br> " I ca n't . I ca n't . I ca n't . I ca n't . " She is crying again . <br> Eddie shades his eyes . " Jesus Christ ! Will you cut that out ! " <br> Clenched jaw . Squinting . It 's the flashing lights . His headaches <br> scare her . <br> " I ca n't help it . " She blows her nose in a stiff cocktail napkin . " I 'm <br> sorry ! " <br> " Just get him outside . " <br> She shakes her head . <br> " In my car . Front seat . " <br> " No ! " <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you what then , I 'm <br> walking out that door , and you either come out with the asshole and <br> we 're on our way in two minutes , or stay here . " He leans close . " For all <br> the fuck I care ! " He storms out . <br> " Eddie ! " <br> The closing door , her flesh ripping from the stool , the grinning <br> man , clutching his suit jacket , staggering her way . " You pretty . . . <br> pretty . . . , " he stammers , reaching for her . " You pretty thing , you . . . " <br> " No . Do n't . " Ashamed , she does n't want the bartender to hear . She <br> gets the door open . " I 'm leaving . I have to go . You stay here . Do n't <br> come out . " She ca n't pull free . His fingers dig into her arm . " He 's out <br> here ! Do n't . " She pushes him . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echo through the desert stillness . She shoves him away . <br> " Go back in ! Please ! " <br> " No ! " His voice thickens with anger . " I ca n't wait ! I 'm gon na fall <br> asleep . We hafta do it now ! " As if for inspection he straightens , lifts his <br> chin , stares at her . " I come fast , " he promises with the pathetic , earnest <br> dignity born of a lifetime justifying inadequacies . " And I do n't slobber <br> around after . " <br> The Mustang 's shadowy hump rises from the side of the building . <br> From here the man ca n't see Eddie crouched in back . <br> " See , you do n't know . . . you do n't understand . . . this is n't what <br> you think , " she whispers . " This is n't  --  " <br> " I know what this is ! " the man shouts , his narrow face hatefully <br> contorted . " It 's a quick fuck before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty bucks . " <br> " No ! Please ! Listen ! " With the press of sweat , his , hers , unwashed , <br> vile , her knees sway . " I have to get out of here ! " <br> " C'mere . " He 's trying to kiss her mouth . " You sweet . . . sweet . . . " <br> " Where 's your car ? " <br> " He said his car . . . " Gesturing , he teeters . <br> " No ! He 's in there . In the back , waiting ! C'm on ! " She grabs <br> his arm . <br> " Pervert . . . goddamn pervert . " The man staggers against her . <br> " ' Magine . . . " <br> It seems the longest walk through the heat , jagged and spitting <br> light from the gigantic pink and lime green flower , flashing overhead , <br> obscene against the stars and the high white peel of moon . Nearing the <br> Mustang she senses Eddie 's dark coil about to spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling him with her . <br> " Hurry ! " she hisses as he fumbles in his pocket . <br> " Oh , Jesus . " He peers at the loose keys in his palm . " She ca n't <br> wait . . . here . . . here , she goes , " he mutters , finally unlocking the door . <br> She scrambles inside , pushes down the lock on her side . <br> " Lock it ! " she cries through the trapped heat . <br> Instead , he is rolling down his window , entreating her thickly to be <br> patient . The Mustang door flies open and Eddie jumps out . <br> " Close it ! " She leans , reaching across him to do it herself . <br> " Oh , you , " the man moans , forcing her head into his lap . <br> " No ! " she groans , hitting him . She sits back . Blood trickles down <br> her chin . His ring , nails , something has cut her lip . " Start the car ! Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window darkens . Eddie 's hand darts in , opens the door . <br> One knee braced on the seat , he jams the heel of his hand into the <br> man 's nose , shoves him against her . " Grab him ! Hold him ! " Eddie <br> yells , face taut in the dim overhead light as he pins the man down . His <br> struggling , oily head grinds against her chest . His whimpering pleas <br> sicken her . <br> Through the distant night comes a probing yellow eye , the train 's <br> steel and wooden clatter , the hard-beating ruckus of the song : <br> So glad we made it , <br> So glad we made it , <br> You got ta gim me some lovin ' , <br> Gim me some lovin ' . . . <br> Breaking free , the man lurches forward , reaches under the seat . A <br> lead pipe . He swings and Eddie knocks it from his hand . <br> " Asshole ! Stupid asshole ! " Eddie 's eyes widen , his nostrils flare <br> with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's face in two . <br> The man jerks forward , arms cradling his head . " What 'd you do that <br> for ? " Eddie keeps demanding in a high , gasping voice , of her , of her , of <br> her as the pipe smashes the man 's head until he sags against the steering <br> wheel . <br> Opening the door , she half falls , half slides , crawling , then running , <br> across the road toward the looming yellow light . Crossing the tracks , <br> she waves her arms and screams into the deafening commotion . " Help <br> me ! Help me ! " Freight and tank cars roar by , parallel with the roadbed . <br> " Help me ! Help me ! Help me ! " she pants , running with the clattering <br> train . In the gaps between cars , come flashes of headlights , going in the <br> same direction as the train . " Oh , Eddie , " she cries , head back , arms <br> pumping as she runs faster than she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , <br> teary phlegm leaking into her bloody mouth . <br> The caboose hurtles past , distant , fading , Eddie 's taillights with it . <br> She stumbles onto the road , back the way she came , the sudden quiet <br> bearing only the platplatplat of her sandals on the macadam , her gasping , <br> wheezy breath , as behind her swells the anxious whine of a car . <br> She dives into the shallow ditch beside the tracks . Eyes closed , she lies <br> curled in cinders . With her cheek to the hard rise of the gully , scrubby <br> brambles snag her arms and legs . The oncoming wheels pulsate in her <br> skull . He slows down , speeds past . She scrambles onto the road , stomach <br> churning with every step . All at once she bends over , vomits , legs <br> splayed , chest heaving , still gagging as headlamps flare high from be- <br> hind , illuminating the emptiness ahead . The truck slows in a squeal of <br> air and brakes . The driver peers down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hollers . <br> " I need a ride ! " <br> " Get in ! " <br> " Oh , Jesus , " she cries as the door closes and the big rig rumbles <br> ahead . <br> " What happened ? " the barrel-chested man asks , dead cigar stub <br> clenched between his teeth . " You in trouble ? " <br> " I do n't know ! " <br> " What happened ? " He taps his chin , the blood . <br> " There was a fight . . . and my boyfriend . . . oh , God , I 'm so scared . <br> Something terrible happened . Oh , God , God , help me , please help <br> me , " she sobs . <br> " He in a convertible ? Yellow Mustang ? Then slide down , just slide <br> down , " the driver says . " Okay , " he says when the car whizzes by . <br> A few miles ahead a cruiser passes , dome light spinning red . The <br> truck driver flips on his radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's staticky voice : " Ambulance ! Up to the club . Fast , Buddy <br> says . " <br> " Oh , God , " she moans into her sticky hands . <br> " Somebody 's hurt . " The driver looks at her . <br> " My boyfriend . Eddie , " she sobs . " This guy tried to hit him . With a <br> pipe . And then , oh , God , " she gags , retching again . <br> " Hey , hey , c'm on now , " the driver says . " You 're all right now . Hey , I <br> got kids myself . How old are you anyways ? " <br> " Seventeen , " she bawls at the horror , the shame of it . Her careful <br> upbringing , her hardworking , principled mother . <br> " What 's your name ? " <br> " Nora . " She hesitates . " Trimble . " <br> " Where you from , Nora ? " <br> " Massachusetts . " <br> " You run away from home or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <br> " Wan na go back ? " <br> " I do n't know . I do n't know what to do . Maybe I should go back , go <br> back and help . Oh , God , he 's back there . In the car . He 's hurt . " <br> " Who ? Eddie ? " <br> " Oh my God , " she moans , covers her face . <br> " How old 's Eddie ? " <br> " Twenty-three . " <br> " Eddie 's a big boy . He 'll take care of it . He do n't need you . " <br> A whoosh now , like the unsealing of a vault , as the truck slows for <br> the ramp onto the interstate . <br> Continues ...
