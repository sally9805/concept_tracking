Section : NATION &; WORLD Family members share the painful calls from the passengers who fought back <p> That Tuesday morning , Todd Beamer 's alarm rang at 5:45 a.m . His wife , Lisa , pulled a pillow over her head . The Oracle account manager had to fly to San Francisco for a meeting at the software company . Normally , he would have left the night before , but on Monday , the couple had returned to their New Jersey home from a weeklong company trip to Italy , and Beamer wanted some time with 3-year-old David and 1-year-old Andrew . So he decided to take United Flight 93 the next day  --  September 11 . <p> In all , 37 passengers boarded the plane at Newark International Airport 's Gate 17 that bright , beautiful morning . Thirty-three were headed to the West Coast for business meetings or vacations  --  or simply returning home . Four had a different agenda . Carrying knives , a quartet of hijackers took control of the plane in midair and began steering it toward another destination  --  authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targets . Exactly what happened on Flight 93 may never be known . Tapes from the cockpit voice recorder are still being examined . As of now , the best account of the heroes onboard comes from phone calls passengers made to family members , who shared their memories with U.S. News . <p> Timing is everything , they say , and timing was part of what foiled the hijackers . The Boeing 757 was to depart Newark International at 8 a.m . It pulled away from the gate at 8:01 , then sat on the tarmac for more than 40 minutes because of heavy traffic . It finally took off at 8:43 a.m . Because of the delay , passengers learned of the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks in the midst of their own crisis  --  and then made their own fateful decisions . <p> Play to win . In the world of airplane travel , passengers who start a flight as strangers usually end up that way , too . But the extraordinary circumstances of Flight 93 changed that . Passengers and crew members joined together and fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men as key players . They were big men , strong men , men who loved sports . Beamer , 32 , 6 feet tall and 200 pounds , was a basketball and softball enthusiast . " He was humble , " his wife says . " But he was very competitive . Winning was important to him . " <p> In seat 4D was Mark Bingham , 31 , 6-foot-5 and 220 pounds , a public-relations executive who played on his college rugby team , ran with the bulls in Pamplona this summer ( and got gored ) , and once wrested a gun from a mugger . He was fiercely competitive , even in a game of Scrabble . " He had no fear , " says Paul Holm , his former domestic partner of six years and a friend . " And he had to win . " <p> Next to him was Tom Burnett , 38 , chief operating officer of medical-device maker Thoratec . The father of three small girls , Burnett was a hockey player and onetime high school quarterback . A friend describes him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Jeremy Glick , 31 , a salesman for a San Francisco Internet firm , sat in coach . Six-foot-1 and 220 pounds , he skied and golfed , wrestled and practiced judo . " He was very competitive , but he channeled his aggressiveness into sports and business , " says his father-in-law , Richard Makely . " Once he was home , he was a very gentle person . " <p> Behind him was Lou Nacke , 42 , manager of a toy-store distribution center . The shortest of the five at 5-foot-9 , the 200-pound weightlifter had a Superman logo tattooed on his left arm . " He was n't one to talk about how super he was , he just showed you , " says Jeff Trichon , his brother-in-law . " He was a man of strength and steel . " <p> For 45 minutes or so , the plane flew west across Pennsylvania toward Cleveland . At 9:35 a.m. , the 757 abruptly made a U-turn and began heading toward Washington . Passengers grabbed for cellphones and in-seat phones . Between 9:31 a.m. to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airfones . <p> Shortly before 9:45 , Jeremy Glick called his wife of five years , Lyzbeth . In high school , she was prom queen to his king . He told her he loved her . Then he told her about " these bad terrorists . " Another passenger , he said , had heard about other terrorist attacks during a call . Was it true ? Lyzbeth told him about the World Trade Center . The hijackers had said they would get to their target or blow up the plane . Glick wanted advice : Should they rush the hijackers or not ? <p> At 9:45 , Todd Beamer told GTE supervisor Lisa Jefferson that 27 passengers had been herded to seats in the rear , while some remained in first class . Two hijackers were in the cockpit ; a third was guarding passengers . The five flight attendants were scattered . One attendant told Beamer two people were on the floor in first class , possibly the pilot and copilot . She was n't sure if they were dead . <p> In shock . Women fought back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 38 , called her home in Greensboro , N.C. " She said her flight had been hijacked by guys with knives , " says her husband , Phil , a pilot . " She said , We are here in the back trying to get hot water to throw on them . Do you have any other ideas ? ' I said , Go with that . ' I was in shock . She sounded calm , but like her adrenaline was really going . " She promised if she survived she would quit and stay home with 1-year-old Nathan , Alexandria , almost 3 , and Shenan , 16 . <p> At 9:45 , Mark Bingham called his mother , Alice Hoglan . It struck her as odd that he said : " This is Mark Bingham . " He told her : " In case I do n't see you again , I love you all . It does n't look good . " <p> Tom Burnett called his wife , Deena , saying they were getting ready to do something . " I said , Who ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I pleaded with him to please sit down and not draw any attention to himself , " she has told reporters . His last words to her : " No , if they were going to run this into the ground , we are going to do something . " <p> Halfway through his 15-minute call to GTE supervisor Jefferson , Todd Beamer said the plane was flying erratically . He made Lisa Jefferson promise to call his family to tell them how much he loved them . He asked her to say the Lord 's Prayer with him . He said several men were going to take on the hijackers . " Are you sure that 's what you want to do ? " Jefferson asked . " Yes , " he replied . <p> At 9:56 a.m. , Flight 93 asked the Federal Aviation Administration to change its destination to Reagan National Airport in Washington . A minute later , the FAA approved , according to Flight Explorer , a firm that tracks such communications . <p> During his 15-minute call , Jeremy Glick told his wife that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrorists . He told her he loved her . " Hold the phone , and I 'll be back , " he said . She could n't bear it and handed the phone to her father . " I heard two sets of screams , " Richard Makely recalls . " I presumed the first set was taking place when they attacked the people . They were rushing the cockpit . It was a chorus of screams and yells . And then , there was a second set a minute or so later . It was a little after 10 . " <p> Lisa Jefferson heard Todd Beamer say , " Are you guys ready ? Let 's roll . " He put the phone down . She heard commotion . No one returned to the phone . She stayed on until the line went dead . <p> Minutes before the crash , Eric Peterson of Lambertsville , Pa. , saw the 757 flying extremely low , maybe 300 feet from the ground . It suddenly careened downward . " We could see more of the top side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's unclear who was at the controls . At 10:10 a.m. , the plane went down in the green grass of an inactive strip mine in Shanksville , Pa. , leaving a vast black crater . <p> Thirteen days after the crash , President Bush invited the Flight 93 families to the White House . The event was n't heavily publicized . In the East Room , Bush said the plane could have been gunning for the White House . He and his wife spent time with each family . " He hugged me and shook hands , " says Robert Weisberg , Lou Nacke 's father-in-law . " He was very emotional . " About 100 staffers lined a hallway . They thanked the families for their lives . <p> Lisa Beamer has received many calls and letters from people who feel indebted to the Flight 93 heroes . A woman whose eighth-grade son was on a field trip to the White House told her " she owed Todd and the other passengers because her son was still alive . " That 's a comfort . " Even if my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " someone else 's life is n't because of what Todd and the other passengers did . They acted courageously and showed they were people of character even under the most difficult circumstances . It is something for us all to look to and strive for , not just in times of trial , but all the time . " <p> Nor will Beamer herself give in to fear . Pregnant with a third child , she flew United 's Newark-to-San Francisco flight last week  --  now called Flight 81  --  for a meeting to set up a foundation in Todd 's name . Heroes in the sky <p> Because United Flight 93 's takeoff was delayed , the passengers had time to learn of the terrorist attacks in New York . That extra time enabled them to plan and launch their own attack to thwart the hijackers . TABLE <p> MAP : Pennsylvania <p> DIAGRAM : United Flight 93 <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Capt .
