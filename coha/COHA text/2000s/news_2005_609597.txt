<p> The Judith Miller-Valerie Plame-Scooter Libby imbroglio is being reduced to a simple narrative about the origins of the Iraq war . Miller , the story goes , was an anti-Saddam Hussein , **35;2211;TOOLONG zealot and was either an eager participant or an unwitting dupe in a campaign by Bush administration officials and Iraqi exiles to justify the invasion . The New York Times now characterizes the affair as " just one skirmish in the continuing battle over the Bush administration 's justification for the war in Iraq . " Miller may be " best known for her role in a series of Times articles in 2002 and 2003 that strongly suggested Saddam Hussein already had or was acquiring an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction . " According to the Times 's critique , she credulously reported information passed on by " a circle of Iraqi informants , defectors and exiles bent on ' regime change ' in Iraq , " which was then " eagerly confirmed by United States officials convinced of the need to intervene in Iraq . " Many critics outside the Times suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line was the primary reason Americans went to war . The Times itself is edging closer to this version of events . <p> There is a big problem with this simple narrative . It is that the Times , along with The Post and other news organizations , ran many alarming stories about Iraq 's weapons programs before the election of George W. Bush . A quick search through the Times archives before 2001 produces such headlines as " Iraq Has Network of Outside Help on Arms , Experts Say " ( November 1998 ) , " U.S. Says Iraq Aided Production of Chemical Weapons in Sudan " ( August 1998 ) , " Iraq Suspected of Secret Germ War Effort " ( February 2000 ) , " Signs of Iraqi Arms Buildup Bedevil U.S. Administration " ( February 2000 ) , " Flight Tests Show Iraq Has Resumed a Missile Program " ( July 2000 ) . ( A somewhat shorter list can be compiled from The Post 's archives , including a September 1998 headline : " Iraqi Work Toward A-Bomb Reported . " ) The Times stories were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myers ; Miller shared a byline on one . <p> Many such stories appeared before and after the Clinton administration bombed Iraq for four days in late 1998 in what it insisted was an effort to degrade Iraqi weapons programs . Philip Shenon reported official concerns that Iraq would be " capable within months  --  and possibly just weeks or days  --  of threatening its neighbors with an arsenal of chemical , biological and even nuclear weapons . " He reported that Iraq was thought to be " still hiding tons of nerve gas " and was " seeking to obtain uranium from a rogue nation or terrorist groups to complete as many as four nuclear warheads . " Tim Weiner and Steven Erlanger reported that Hussein was closer than ever " to what he wants most : keeping a secret cache of biological and chemical weapons . " " To maintain his chemical and biological weapons  --  and the ability to build more , " they reported , Hussein had sacrificed over $120 billion in oil revenue and " devoted his intelligence service to an endless game of cat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspections . " <p> In 1999 Weiner reported that " Iraq 's chances of rebuilding a secret arsenal look good . " Hussein was " scouring the world for tools to build new weapons . " He might " be as close to building a nuclear weapon  --  perhaps closer  --  than he was in 1991 . " In 2000 Myers reported that Iraq had rebuilt 12 " missile factories or industrial sites " thought to be " involved in Iraq 's efforts to produce weapons of mass destruction " and had " continued its pursuit of biological and chemical weapons . " <p> The Times 's sources were " administration officials , " " intelligence officials , " " U.N . weapons inspectors " and " international analysts . " The " administration officials " were , of course , Clinton officials . A number of stories were based not on off-the-record conversations but on public statements and documentation by U.N . inspectors . <p> From 1998 through 2000 , the Times editorial page warned that " without further outside intervention , Iraq should be able to rebuild weapons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military attacks may be required to diminish the arsenal again . " Otherwise , Iraq could " restore its ability to deliver biological and chemical weapons against potential targets in the Middle East . " " The world , " it said , " can not leave Mr. Hussein free to manufacture horrific germs and nerve gases and use them to terrorize neighboring countries . " <p> Times editorials insisted the danger from Iraq was imminent . When the Clinton administration attempted to negotiate , they warned against letting " diplomacy drift into dangerous delay . Even a few more weeks free of inspections might allow Mr. Hussein to revive construction of a biological , chemical or nuclear weapon . " They also argued that it was " hard to negotiate with a tyrant who has no intention of honoring his commitments and who sees nuclear , chemical and biological weapons as his country 's salvation . " " As Washington contemplates an extended war against terrorism , " a Times editorial insisted , " it can not give in to a man who specializes in the unthinkable . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Security Council is wobbly , with Russia and France eager to ease inspections and sanctions . " Any approach " that depends on Security Council unity is destined to be weak . " " Mr. Kofi Annan 's resolve seems in doubt . " When Hans Blix was appointed to head the U.N . inspectors , the editors criticized him for " a decade-long failure to detect Iraq 's secret nuclear weapons program before the gulf war " and for a " tendency to credit official assurances from rulers like Mr. Hussein . " His selection was " a disturbing sign that the international community lacks the determination to rebuild an effective arms inspection system . " The " further the world gets from the gulf war , the more it seems willing to let Mr. Hussein revive his deadly weapons projects . " Even " many Americans question the need to maintain pressure on Baghdad and would oppose the use of force . But the threat is too great to give ground to Mr. Hussein . The cost to the world and to the United States of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be far greater than the cost of preventing Baghdad from rearming . " <p> The Times was not alone , of course . On Jan. 29 , 2001 , The Post editorialized that " of all the booby traps left behind by the Clinton administration , none is more dangerous  --  or more urgent  --  than the situation in Iraq . Over the last year , Mr. Clinton and his team quietly avoided dealing with , or calling attention to , the almost complete unraveling of a decade 's efforts to isolate the regime of Saddam Hussein and prevent it from rebuilding its weapons of mass destruction . That leaves President Bush to confront a dismaying panorama in the Persian Gulf , " including " intelligence photos that show the reconstruction of factories long suspected of producing chemical and biological weapons . " <p> This was the consensus before Bush took office , before Scooter Libby assumed his post and before Judith Miller did most of the reporting for which she is now , uniquely , criticized . It was based on reporting by a large of number of journalists who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence analysts , Clinton officials and weapons inspectors . As we wage what the Times now calls " the continuing battle over the Bush administration 's justification for the war in Iraq , " we will have to grapple with the stubborn fact that the underlying rationale for the war was already in place when this administration arrived . <p> Robert Kagan , a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and Transatlantic Fellow at the German Marshall Fund , writes a monthly column for The Post .
