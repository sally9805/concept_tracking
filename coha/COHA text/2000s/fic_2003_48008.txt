" HAS ANYONE HERE SEEN my mom ? " <p> The boy holding the photograph could n't have been more than sixteen , seventeen , although the rows of silver hoops along his eyebrows and the Frankenstein studs on his cheeks and lower lip were clearly meant to deter you from looking too close . Skinny and pale as a fish belly , he wore a black leather jacket with the sleeves ripped off , frayed cutoff jeans and knee-high combat boots . His various tattoos included notched swords , double-headed axes , your usual cartoon superhero stuff . <p> There were about half a dozen customers in the Silver Oracle at the time and they all looked up , some of them in horror . It 's a funny thing about people working on their karma . They 'll spend a fortune on books written by weirdos with goofy names and scary hairdos . They 'll spend thousands on package tours to drink spit-beer with naked shamans in malaria-infested jungles , but drop someone slightly counterculture into their midst and they scatter like old maids in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hasty departures of at least three of them . <p> I came out from around the counter where I 'd rung through yet another copy of Breathing Techniques to Make You a Billionaire . " Hello , son . May I take a look ? " <p> First he backed off . I can have that effect on people . But once he realized I was n't going to toss him out , he handed me the picture . <p> It was a basic four-by-six-inch Kodak of a forty-something woman sitting on a sofa with a young teenaged boy - my newest acquaintance minus a few years and the metal . She had chin-length blond hair from a bottle , wide-set brown eyes just like her son , and a nice smile . " Fine looking woman , " I said . <p> " Have you seen her ? " <p> " Not that I recall . When was she here last ? " <p> " About three years ago . " <p> " Hell , " I said , handing the photo back . " I have trouble remembering three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I should n't have joked . The kid 's shoulders slumped , the light left his eyes . What skin and bone there was of him seemed to shrink even smaller . <p> " Thanks anyway , " he said , turning . <p> " Hold on a minute . " <p> He stopped , not bothering to raise his head . <p> " Would you mind showing me her picture again ? " <p> " What for ? " he said . I did n't blame him . He was protecting his mom , or what remained of her for him , from the gorilla with the smart-ass tongue . <p> " We have a few regulars in here . Thought I 'd ask around . " <p> " Ca n't let you have it , " he said . <p> " I just meant right now , with the folks who are in the store . " I was humoring him , we both knew it . But my guess was , this kid was reaching the end of his trail , and there 's a certain luxury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He handed me the photo . <p> I looked around at my three remaining customers and knew once again that I 'd blown it . Ernestine Satchell was president of the local Spiritual Snobs Association . That was n't the group 's real name , of course , but it gives you an idea . She and her wealthy cronies met every week to do past life regressions , channel ETs , and gossip about other people 's auras . <p> " Ernestine , can you help us out here ? " <p> She had been rummaging through the healing stones , cursing herself , I knew , for not ducking out when she had the chance . Her sterling silver dreamcatcher earrings tinkled when she looked up . " Why , certainly , White Cloud . " <p> Ernestine came over and looked at the photo without actually touching it . I counted off the seconds . One , two .... <p> When enough time had passed , she said to me , not the boy , " I 'm sorry , I 've never seen her before . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , White Cloud , I really must be going . " <p> I turned away , gave her my frostiest shoulder . Ernestine , I knew , would write off my behavior as a cultural thing . Native Americans , especially the men , do n't waste words , she would say at her next group meeting , and they do n't like eye contact . <p> " What about that guy ? " the boy asked , pointing to an empty spot where Sam had once stood . <p> " I do n't think .... " <p> " Is he a regular ? " <p> " Oh , yeah . " <p> " You said you 'd ask around . " <p> " That is what I said . " I peered around the shelves . " Sam ... you there ? " <p> He did n't answer , did n't expect he would . Sam , whose last name I 'd never learned , had a full-blown terror of psychic attack . Over the years , he 'd probably emptied my store two times over buying crystals , rattles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to man . Sometimes when I was doing ceremony , I would envision Sam and blow sacred smoke through his aura . ( It looked like gray Swiss cheese . ) Then I would n't see him for three , four days . So I quit doing that . Call me a greedy bugger , but you ca n't pay the rent if you heal your best customers . <p> " Why is he hiding ? " the boy whispered . <p> " He wants you to think he 's not here , " I whispered back . <p> " Yeah , but why ? " <p> " He thinks you 're a government agent . " <p> The boy 's hardy laugh scared even me . I glared at him , put a finger to my mouth . But I could n't contain his glee and did n't really want to . <p> " May I see the picture ? " <p> We turned at the same time to find a pretty young woman looking at us . I 'd noticed her earlier , of course . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'd never seen her before today . She was slender and blonde ( not from a bottle ) and wore a floor-length black sun dress with a fiery gold Oriental dragon snaking up the front . She was holding a book on White Magic . <p> I turned to the boy . It was his call . I thought he looked a bit stunned , the way you look when a Frisbee has just hit you on the forehead . His hand moved slowly across the space between them . <p> The girl studied the photo with great care . She turned it around , as if maybe there was some kind of clue written there , only no one had thought of looking . Then she examined the picture again . Finally she smiled and handed it back to him . " Thank you , " she said . <p> " No problem , " he replied . <p> I did n't know quite what to do next . The boy and I had exhausted our possibilities , but it did n't seem right just to send him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already effected his escape , and a glance at the clock told me it was twenty minutes to closing . Twenty very long minutes if the three of us were just going to keep gawking at each other . " How about some tea ? " I suggested . <p> " Umm ... no , thanks , " the boy said . <p> " It 's on the house . " <p> " I 'd love some tea , " the girl said . <p> " Me too , " he piped . <p> Great , I thought , the kid 's not here five minutes , and Cupid has already shot his arrow . <p> The small L-shaped alcove at the back of the store was a nice private spot for spiritual seekers and a place for me to snooze when my upstairs apartment got too hot . There were two wicker chairs , a coffee table and an overstuffed sofa with a handmade Navajo blanket . In the corner was a card table with a stainless steel urn . A wooden sign hanging from the urn read , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regulars at the Silver Oracle knew that Today 's Feature Flavor was always Sage . Newcomers thought , is n't that sweet , free tea , and a new kind every day . <p> I 'd been drinking sage tea ever since I quit the hard stuff , two years , four months and thirteen days ago . Health books will tell you that sage is good for the heart , the circulation , damned near everything , but I drink it because the smell brings me back to my days on the rez . Riding Old Paint at a full gallop , my hair blowing , the tingle of wild sage and pinon against a brisk west wind . Life just does n't get better than that , but at ten , I was too young to know it . <p> I found three mugs with no cracks and hardly any chips and filled them with hot green brew . I handed the angel mug to the girl who was sitting at one end of the sofa . I gave the plain black one to the boy who sat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for myself and took the wicker chair . " By the way , " I said , " my name 's White Cloud . " <p> " I 'm Brian , " the boy said , reaching over to shake my hand . <p> " Pleasure to meet you . " <p> We both turned to the young woman . " My name , " she said , with a toss of her straight blonde locks , " is Antigone . " <p> Brian snorted . " What kind of name is that ? Did you just make it up ? " <p> Incredible , I thought , the kid 's got the same way with women as me . <p> " I 'll have you know , " she said , " Antigone was the heroine of a famous Greek tragedy . " <p> " Yeah , but that does n't make you her . " <p> She glared at him in a very pretty , pouty way , and then , to my surprise , she caved . " My real name is Jane , okay ? But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called me by my new name . " <p> " Sure , " he said , as if he 'd only been looking for honesty all along . <p> " How old are you ? " Antigone asked Brian . <p> " Seventeen , nearly . How old are you ? " <p> " I 'll be twenty next month . " They both slurped their tea in unison . <p> Well , now that we got that straightened out . " Do you live around here ? " I asked him . <p> " I 'm from Detroit . " <p> " You 've come a long ways . " <p> " Been to six states , so far . " <p> " How long you been looking ? " <p> " I 've been on the road a year and a half . Mom 's been missing for three . " <p> " Three years ago , that 's when she was here , " Antigone said , clearing up any doubts as to whether she 'd been eavesdropping earlier . <p> " Yeah , we came down here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , we drove back home . I woke up the next morning , she was gone . " <p> " Did n't the police look for her ? " <p> " Sure , at first , but then they figured she ran off with her boyfriend . She would never do that . Mom would never leave without telling me . " Brian was staring into his tea , clutching the mug so tight his fingernails were blue . " Anyway , her boyfriend was a bastard . He 's the reason we came down here , to get away from him . " <p> Antigone and I both stopped asking questions . A person 's walking through his pain , best thing to do is wait off to the side . I got up , rummaged in the milk crate underneath the card table and found a box of ancient grain crackers that some health food salesman had given me as samples . I poured some onto a plate ( they landed like flagstones ) and brought them to my guests . The air seemed to have cleared a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , offering the crackers , " not to give up on someone , but what made you decide to come here , to the Oracle ? " <p> Brian took a handful . " Mom loved this place . We were staying at the campground down the road , and we used to come here almost every day . That 's why I thought you 'd remember . " <p> " Hmm . " I nodded , dropped my gaze . <p> " We hiked all the trails together . She used to talk to the trees , pick up stones and shit for her medicine bag - oh , sorry , I did n't mean no disrespect . " <p> " Do n't worry about it . " I was racking my brain , trying to remember a blonde woman with a thirteen-year-old boy , and coming up empty . The canyons of my brain ran deep where the Five Star brandy used to flow , and I knew there was lots I would never get back . " Was I working then ? " I asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Yeah , you were here , but you were different . " <p> " Different how ? " <p> " I du n no . " <p> But Brian did know , he was just being kind . I was louder then and happier , in that sad , drunk kind of way . I could talk New Age bullshit till your ears fell off . I could tell you who you were in another life , I could channel your guides and jumpstart your chakras , snookered to the eyeballs the whole time . And in case you 're wondering about the smell , Altoids and incense can go a long way . <p> I looked at my watch . " Time to close the store . " <p> " Wait . " Antigone leaped from the sofa . " There 's some stuff I want to buy . " <p> " Sure . " I got up and went to the cash register , suddenly all business . I did n't want to deal with Brian and his missing mother , and I especially did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the man I still was . I was a twenty-first-century snake oil salesman , and if I planned to stay sober between now and bedtime , it would be good for me to remember that . <p> Antigone took almost no time gathering what she wanted . She got the book on white magic , a copy of Wicca for Beginners , and a pile of tools for grounding and spell casting . Normally , I would have " confirmed her purchases " as the retail gurus like to put it , maybe worked in an upsell or two , but this time , I rang them through without comment . <p> I was swiping Antigone 's bank card when she leaned across the counter and whispered , " You have to help him , you know . " <p> I punched a couple of buttons , handed her the pinpad . " No , I do n't . " <p> " But he 's come all this way . " <p> " Yeah ? " I growled , hoping she 'd catch the unspoken , " So ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you call yourself a - oh , never mind ! " <p> " I do n't call myself anything . " That much at least was true . I could n't help what my customers said . <p> Antigone had perfect pink lips to go with everything else that was perfect about her , and they were pursed now in disgust while she punched in her numbers . I had a fleeting glimpse of what a formidable witch she would turn out to be , but for the time being at least , she was harmless . <p> Purchase approved . Tear off transaction receipt , staple to sales bill , insert with purchases into appropriate-sized bag . " Thank you for shopping at the Silver Oracle . " I offered my finest customer service smile . " Hope to see you again soon . " <p> As soon as the door slammed , in the very instant that the first two bamboo stalks collided in chime , I returned to normal . Normal , for me , that is . <p> I thanked whatever gods might be hovering that Brian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't wandered over and heard what an unutterable asshole I can be when I 'm reminded of the fact that I ca n't have a drink . Ever . <p> " Look , " I said , sinking into the chair beside him . " I do n't know if I can be of any help . But I got a couple of venison steaks in the freezer and a sofa bed upstairs that 's halfways comfortable . If you need a place to bunk down while you 're looking for your mom , you got one . " <p> If I 'd a been his age , going through what he must have gone through , I 'd have probably bawled like a baby . His eyes filled up and his facial muscles went through a few contortions , but other than that , he held it all together . " Thanks , " he said , " I appreciate it . " <p> THE NEXT DAY was my day off , and it dawned a fine one , sunny and cool . October , this part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get . There were no bugs , no tourists , just the clean scent of pine and an endless blue sky . <p> I brewed a fresh pot of Ethiopian Gold , poured myself a cup . Then I tiptoed past the sleeping bulge on the sofa bed to the back door . My luxury view from the top of the fire escape included a small gravel parking lot and the neighbor 's back yard , bordered with weeds and derelict chicken wire . <p> Today was laundry day , or to be more precise , it was the day that I argued with myself against doing laundry . There were few things I hated more than hauling my lazy butt down Main Street to the local Wash ' n ' Dry . I always ran into people who recognized me , and they always had things they wanted to say . " Hey , White Cloud , I had this dream last night , " or , " Remember when you told me I 'd be meeting someone ? " It did n't matter if I was carrying eight bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear . Time was getting close , maybe , to move to some old mountaintop . <p> " Hi . " <p> I looked up , saw a face I hardly recognized . It was Brian with sticky up morning hair and no Frankenstein studs . I understood now why he wore them . In his natural state , he looked all of twelve . " Hi , " I said . " Hungry ? " <p> He shrugged . He was famished , was what he was saying . <p> I told him to help himself to the shower while I cooked us some breakfast . <p> Somewhere between flipping eggs and buttering toast , I got the notion of checking out the woods . Brian had said that he and his mom hiked all the trails when they were here , and I thought maybe , if we retraced them together . . . . <p> That was as far as my thought went , but it was enough . At least I 'd be spared the ignominy of Main Street and whatever voodoo curse Antigone might have put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brian while we ate . <p> " I was thinking the woods was where I 'd begin , " he said . <p> " I do n't want you getting your hopes up , " I warned him , like an idiot . <p> " That 's my business , " he growled . <p> Brian insisted on doing the dishes , which impressed the hell out of me , after which we locked up and descended the fire escape stairs . Coming around the front of the store , we nearly crashed into Antigone whose nose was pressed up against the display window . <p> " We 're closed Mondays , " I said . <p> She let out a shriek , slapped a hand to her chest . " My God , you scared me half to death ! " <p> " Sorry , did n't mean to . " <p> I might have been treated to a further tongue lashing , but then she noticed I was n't alone and her features softened . " Good morning , Brian . " <p> " Morning . " <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that brief instant , I knew I 'd been redeemed . " What are you guys up to ? " <p> " Nothing much , " I said . <p> " Hiking , " Brian said . " Wan na join us ? " <p> " I ca n't . I 've got classes . " Hearing the crash of his poor young heart , she added , " But I 'm free later , for coffee , or whatever . " <p> " That 's cool , " he said . <p> They were exchanging twinkly smiles when I noticed something brush past Antigone . A shadow , a movement , I could n't be sure . Whatever it was , I did n't like the look of it . <p> " Was there something you wanted this morning ? " I asked her , careful to give nothing away in my voice . <p> " What ? Oh , yeah , I almost forgot . " She fumbled through a crammed purse , whipped out a leather sheath and from that , a double-edged knife . I ducked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My athame does n't work , " she said . <p> I noticed after I got my breath back that she had pronounced it " athayme , " to rhyme with Auntie Mame . " Ah-thah-meh , " I corrected . " How do you know it does n't work ? " <p> She was wearing a dragon again today , this time on a black wrap skirt . Its scales were varying shades of teal green , its outstretched claws ferocious . Everything else about Antigone , her pastel tank top , soft golden tan , exuded gentle femininity . <p> " I was using it last night , " she said , slicing back and forth through the air like a maniac , " to disconnect from my boyfriend . He phoned me this morning , and we had a horrible fight . " <p> " How long you had the athame ? " Brian asked . <p> " I just bought it yesterday . " <p> " Did you bless it ? " <p> " No . Was I supposed to ? " <p> He gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you 're under eighteen . <p> " Oh , " she said , examining the tool with renewed interest . " Will you show me how ? " <p> " Sure . " <p> " I thought you were n't into that stuff , " I said to Brian . <p> " Does n't mean I was n't paying attention . " <p> " So I 'll see you later then , " Antigone said . <p> " Yeah , " Brian said . <p> She scribbled something on a scrap of paper . " Here 's my cell number . Give me a call when you want to get together . " <p> " Thanks . " <p> There it was again , that darting movement around Antigone . If it were visible , it would look like a curtain snapping in the wind or a dark , mottled linen being yanked off a table . It had a taunting now-you-see-me , now-you-do n't quality . And I 'd seen the bugger twice . <p> " Let 's go , " I said to Brian , giving him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover . " <p> I was a kid the first time I noticed things that could n't be seen , and I might not have noticed them if they had n't gotten in the way of serious playtime . Most of them were harmless , annoying , really - initiated by my parents , endured by me . I remember trying to explain them to my friends , and getting laughed at . For one thing , I could n't find the right words , which made my tongue knot up and my chest tighten . I would gasp and stutter , turn red in the face . My childhood asthma probably started around then . For another thing , my buddies did n't care about what they called pissy-sissy stuff . Our heroes in those days were John Wayne and John Glenn , larger-than-life white guys . Sure , we pretended sometimes to be Crazy Horse or Geronimo , but we knew only of their warrior exploits . No one ever told us of their wise and impenetrable quiet sides . <p> Now , nearly fifty years later , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . It was n't walking side by side like Brian and I were doing when we entered the North Trail . It was more like being one inside the other , the young White Cloud within the elder , moving in synchrony , a drumbeat . <p> I had instructed Brian at the edge of the woods to remember his mother as she was when they were hiking . " Be who you were then , " I said . " If you were annoyed with her , feel it . If you were having fun , feel that too . Be a thirteen-year-old kid on vacation with his mom . I 'm just going to walk alongside . Where the trail narrows , I 'll follow you . " <p> He seemed to have no trouble understanding my instructions , but acting on them was something else . For the first quarter mile , he battled with fear , scattering and shattering everything around him . Gradually , his emotions calmed , and then he sank into sadness . <p> " Do n't miss your mom , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you now . " <p> With sputtering uncertainty , he started to bring his mother into focus . Bound by the trail and rhythm of the walk , I could feel his mind quieting . I urged Brian to quicken his pace . If I could keep us both on the edge of windedness , where thoughts ca n't so easily intrude , we 'd have a better chance of succeeding . <p> The trails were circular , great looping things that wound and climbed through the foothills of the northwestern mountains . The forests were old growth with some birch and maple , but mostly they were jack pine , juniper , and spruce . There was something primeval about an evergreen forest , the way it held you in , cushioning the ground and screening out the sunlight . Senses were awakened and reconfigured . You could feel the towering pride of an old spruce on your skin , taste electric silver-blue around a juniper . And as my people have known for millennia , an evergreen forest can smoke you . You can walk for hours and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not realize that you 're lost and swear as you 're drawing your last breath that you 've covered no distance at all . <p> I saw the outline of her first . A tall woman , long-limbed , loose in the shoulders , arms swinging freely as she walked . There was no tension in her , not here , in this current memory . The echoes of her laughter spiraled upward through the treetops , wove happily through birds ' nests and burst through the berries of creeping vines . As the trail rose , I could feel the surge of her powerful heartbeat . She was in good shape when she passed through these woods , no clogged arteries , no tar or nicotine gumming up her lungs . I wondered for a brief , pointless moment if people would change once science could prove that every footfall , every breath we take on Mother Earth is recorded . Probably not , we 're such idiots . But the fact remained , the woman who 'd gone missing in the visible world had left her full story in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boy who walked before me . <p> It took me seven or eight miles of hard hiking before I felt confident of keeping her trail . A good bloodhound can sniff a piece of clothing once and remember the scent for days . Sure , it 's a different kind of scent - or maybe it 's not , what do I know ? Anyways , what I 'm saying is , I 'd make a lousy bloodhound . <p> Brian was exhausted , and so was I. We never let up our pace , not once , and when I finally told him he could take it easy , we both realized we were flat-out whacked . We collapsed at the edge of a rocky mountain stream . The water was cold , clean , tasted like heaven . We took off our shoes and soaked our blistered feet , then fell onto our backs in silence and gratitude . <p> I was n't going to ask anything more of Brian that day . He 'd accomplished wonders , though he probably did n't know it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trust than he 'd used up today . " You know something , do n't you ? " was the only thing he said on our slow plod homeward . <p> I gave a nondistinctive twitch of the shoulders . Maybe . <p> " There were two places in the world where my mom was happiest in her studio and outside with nature , " Brian said that night to Antigone , who had joined us for pizza and root beer . <p> " Was n't she happy when she was with you ? " <p> Brian gave a lopsided grin . " Well , yeah , but who would n't be ? " <p> The two of them had spent the twilight hour on the fire escape with a bowl of water and sea salt to cleanse Antigone 's athame . This was no somber affair of witchery . I could hear them laughing , flicking water at each other through the open window . When they came inside , I noticed a thin layer of protection around Antigone . The equivalent of mosquito net ; it would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was a start . <p> " What kind of studio did your mom have ? " I asked , my throbbing feet in clean socks propped on the coffee table . <p> " She was a glass maker . Not just flasks and vases , she could make anything - sculptures , landscapes . Once , she made a whole ceiling for some European gazillionaire that looked like an ocean floor . There were corals , fish , sea anemones that looked like they were actually in water it was amazing . " <p> A loud shattering noise made me sit up , slam both feet on the floor . <p> " What 's the matter ? " Brian asked . <p> I looked around , saw that all my priceless clutter was still in place . I noticed too that Antigone had startled at the same instant , though not as intensely . She probably would have passed it off as a nervous shudder if Brian had n't spoken . <p> " What was that ? " she asked . " Did something break downstairs ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I did n't hear anything . " Brian helped himself to another piece of pizza . <p> " Shh , " I said , closing my eyes for a better look . It took me a while to get past the two young people staring at me , and the digestive burbles of my stomach . I had a brief , inappropriate longing for something alcoholic , and then my thoughts settled . Deeper and deeper , I could feel myself sinking , the way you do when you 're falling asleep . I might even have dozed off and snored for a few minutes , which would account for Brian and Antigone 's expressions when I sat bolt upright , wide-eyed . " Do you remember , " I said , " when you got home from vacation , three years ago ? " <p> " Uh . . . yeah . " <p> Brian was looking freaked , and I realized that I was staring at him like some kind of bogey man . I rubbed my eyes , tried to bring back my usual charming expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ? " <p> " She was always working on something . " <p> " The day she went missing , you said you woke up and she was gone . What time was that ? " <p> " I do n't know , probably around noon . It was summer vaca - " He stopped suddenly . " Something was broken in the studio when I got up . I remember seeing glass everywhere . The police even asked me about it later . " <p> " What was the piece , do you know ? " <p> " I ca n't remember , it was part of something huge . . . for a hotel lobby , I think . " <p> " A natural scene ? " <p> " Uh-huh . " Brian set down the pizza and covered his eyes with both hands . " Lemme think now , there was lots of glass . It was white . . . pale blue . . . some of it was clear . " <p> " Water , " Antigone suggested . <p> " Yeah . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what it was . Something must have gone wrong in the kiln , and the glass did n't set properly . " <p> " Where was the waterfall in real life ? " I asked . <p> " Shit , I do n't know . No , wait . . . there was this nature center , not far from Detroit . We used to go there a lot . It has this humongous gorge with rapids , and at the end of the rapids , you come to a . . . . " His face , normally pale , drained to a translucent gray . " That 's where she is , is n't she ? " <p> I nodded . " I 'm pretty sure . " <p> " Did someone . . . ? " <p> " No , it was her heart . An infarction , I think they call it . People who seem perfectly healthy can - " <p> " Wait a minute , White Cloud , " Antigone protested .

" <p> " So what are you going to tell the police , that you talked with a couple of nuts at a New Age store and you suddenly know where your mother is ? " <p> Brian picked up Antigone 's athame with the mother-of-pearl handle and the double-edged blade . Normally , I tell new witches they should n't let other people touch their tools , but in this case , I had no problem . He turned the blade slowly , staring into the mirrored surfaces . With his fingertip , he touched the point gently and laid the tool down . " I 'm gon na tell them , " he said , " to look at Mom 's sketches , and then bring them to the waterfalls .
