Hear No Evil LP Chapter One " My husband was murdered . " Lindsey Hart spoke in the detached voice of a young widow still grieving . It was as if she still could n't believe that the words were coming from her mouth , that something so horrible had actually happened . " Shot once in the head . " " I 'm very sorry . " Jack wished he could say more , but he 'd been in this situation before , and he knew there really was n't anything he could say . It was God 's will ? Time heals all wounds ? None of that would do her any good , certainly not from his lips . People sometimes turned to strangers for that kind of comfort , but rarely when the stranger was a criminal defense lawyer billing by the hour . Jack Swyteck was among the best Miami 's criminal trial bar had to offer , having defended death row inmates for four years before switching sides to become a federal prosecutor . He was in his third year of private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that he 'd yet to land the kind of high-charged , high-profile jury trial that had vaulted plenty of lesser lawyers into stardom . But he was doing just fine for a guy who 'd withstood an indictment for murder , a divorce from a fruitcake , and the unexplained appearance of the naked , dead body of his ex-girlfriend in his bathtub . " Do the police know who did it ? " asked Jack . " They think they do . " " Who ? " " Me . " The natural follow-up question caught in Jack 's throat , and before he could even broach the subject , Lindsey said , " I did n't do it . " " Are there any witnesses who say you did ? " " Not that I know of . Which is to be expected , since I 'm innocent . " " Was the murder weapon recovered ? " " Yes . It was on the bedroom floor . Oscar was shot with his own sidearm . " " Where did it happen ? " " In our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you home ? " " No . " " Then how do you know he was sleeping ? " She hesitated , as if the question had caught her off guard . " The investigators told me he was in bed , no sign of any struggle , so it 's only logical that he was either taken completely by surprise or was asleep . " Jack took a moment , not so much to collect his thoughts as to gather his impression of Lindsey Hart . She was a few years younger than he was , he guessed , articulate and composed . Her business suit was charcoal gray , a conservative step beyond the traditional black of mourning , though she allowed herself a little color in the silk blouse and scarf . She was prettyprobably even more attractive than what presently met the eye , as Jack suspected that in her grief she 'd lost a little too much weight and paid not enough attention to her appearance . He said , " I know this is painful for you . But has anyone considered the possibility that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't commit suicide . He had too much to live for . " " Most people who take their own life do . They just lose perspective . " " His gun was found with the safety on . Not very likely that he shot himself in the head and then put on the safety . " " Ca n't argue with that . Though it also strikes me as curious that someone would shoot your husband and then take the time to put on the safety . " " There are many curious things about my husband 's death . That 's why I need you . " " Fair enough . Let 's get back to what you were doing the day of his death . What time did you leave the house ? " " Five-thirty . Same as every day . I work at the hospital . My shift begins at six . " " I assume you 're having trouble convincing people that he was alive when you left . " " The medical examiner put the time of death sometime before five . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , just recently . " " How long ago was your husband killed ? " " Ten weeks yesterday . " " Have you spoken to the police ? " " Of course . I wanted to do everything possible to help catch the killer . Until it started to come clear that I was a suspect . That 's when I decided I needed a lawyer . " Jack scratched his head and said , " None of this is ringing a bell for me , and I 'm usually something of a newshound when it comes to homicides . Was it City of Miami or Miami-Dade homicide you talked to ? " " Neither . It was NCIS agents . Naval Criminal Investigative Services . This all happened at the naval base . " " Which one ? " " Guantnamo . " " Guantnamo , Cuba ? " " Yes . My husband was career military . We 've lived there for almost six years now . Or at least until his death . " " I did n't realize that families even lived there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Castro . " " Oh , no . It 's a huge living and working community , thousands of people . We have schools , our own newspaper . We even have a McDonald 's . " Jack considered it , then said , " I want to be up front about this : I have absolutely no experience in dealing with military matters . " " This is n't strictly military . I 'm a civilian , so I would have to be charged as a civilian , even though my husband was a military officer . " " I understand that . But the crime scene is on a naval base ...
