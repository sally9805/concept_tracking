In Which We Learn How an Ebreo Travels Best in Tuscany <br> <br> Nonno looked east across the roll of his farm at that particular moment in a late  --  summer dawn when the soon  --  to  --  be  --  risen sun threw an expectant hue of orange and purple across the horizon . It was a beautiful sight , indeed , but the day  --  breaking spectrum held a bit too much uncertainty for Nonno 's comfort . The old man scrunched his eyes for better focus and continued his gaze outward , searching the horizon for some small harbinger affirming that their travels today would go safely and that he was doing what was best for his grandson . Then , in the distance , it lumbered into view . <br> It was the obstinate old stud , the one inherited along with the farm and the one Nonno loved the most . The donkey paused along the eastern border of the land , atop a slight knoll and between a pair of ancient fig trees . This alone was a sublime image , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the horizon , careened its head upward and let go with an impassioned bray , Nonno knew the God of Abraham would be with him and his grandson as they traveled to Florence . <br> The mournful cry erupted from the donkey 's mouth and filled Nonno 's ears as profoundly as the sounding of a shofar on Rosh Hashanah . Against the still morning it was a sound of such magnitude that it rose from the horizon like a gust of wind billowing a ship 's sails and drawing all hands to deck . Songbirds quieted and competing roosters halted in mid  --  crow as the lonely bellow ballooned to a mass , teetered on its own enormity and began to roll across the land . The sound , robust , anxious , a touch melancholy , tumbled across the farm , hurdling row upon row of tomato plants before leaping the old farm 's wall . It rambled down valley and over hill . It combed through grape vineyards and rustled about olive orchards . It rumbled up the road and breached the village walls . It echoed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine barrels and whistled through empty oil jugs , moving every like creature to concur until the entire countryside rang with the chorus of a thousand lonely donkeys . <br> Allied with the crisp dawn air and amethyst horizon , the bray had a supernatural quality that affected and connected all of our tale 's characters . To begin with , it put a smile on the face of the Good Padre as he tended the church 's vegetable garden . It eased the anguish of Cosimo di Pucci de ' Meducci the Third , Grand Duke of Tuscany , after an awful week in Rome . It disturbed the stomach of Chef Luigi Campoverde as he stuffed ground pork and veal into sausage casings with fennel , sage , salt and yellow raisins . It startled and annoyed Giuseppe , as did anything that seemed to emanate from a power greater than himself , while it thrilled both Benito and Bobo the Fool for the very reason it unnerved their boss . With amorous serendipity it caused our heroine , Mari , to pause while stirring a batch of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davido , paused as he loaded a basket with tomatoes . <br> But for Nonno , the sound of an obstinate and misunderstood beast of burden wailing against an uncaring world was a physical and aural incarnation of what it meant to be an Ebreo in a gentile world , and a tear of both sadness and joy streaked the old man 's face . By ways unexpected and through loss unimaginable , Nonno had managed to relocate his family and closest of kin from the ghetto of Florence , with its vicious plagues and politics , to a safer home and farm in the country . A place , he wished , where his extended family could peaceably prosper . <br> Though all the children who lived on the farm called him Nonno , his one true grandchild , Davido , was soon to be married , which meant Nonno would have something real to leave him  --  land and a wife . Nonno hoped that under Davido 's leadership the farm would blossom into a place where Ebrei from Florence , Siena , Pitigliano , even as far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghettos and create a new life . Nonno understood that this late  --  coming dream would not reach fruition in his lifetime . He could feel his power waning . His body was still fairly limber and his mind still somewhat sharp , but he knew it was Davido 's time to come to the fore and prayed daily for the strength of his grandson . <br> He was an odd boy , his Davido , odd in ways Nonno admired and also feared . Goodness knows , Nonno was pleased by the seriousness with which his grandson took to farming . The boy was coming into his own . A year of hard country life had toughened up his grandchild and put a bit of muscle on his skinny frame , but Nonno found the boy 's devotion to the tomato a bit obsessive . He had no problem with his grandson 's newfound love of the earth , but he did n't want the boy turning into one of those half  --  crazed farmers he knew from the markets of Florence . The kind of folk who mumble and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sweetly when talking to the vegetables upon their stand . Truth be told , the way Davido would talk to the tomato plants  --  his nose pressed closely against the leaves as if to inhale their entirety into the depth of his brain-Nonno was concerned some of this countrified madness had already beset the boy . Nothing a good wife and some children would n't cure , thought Nonno . God willing , their trip today would help see to that . <br> Il Raglio Sacro , the Holy Bray , echoed into oblivion and returned Davido 's thoughts to the day at hand . Woefully , he lowered his gaze from the horizon so to look into the basket held in his hands . His eyes could not help but mist with tears  --  the tomatoes were that beautiful . His first true crop : lush , round , slightly ribbed , a shade of red unmatched in all of nature , with a melding of yellow as the fruit bent and crinkled toward its green stem . What a shame , he thought to himself with an earnestness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they 're sent off to die in a pointless war . He would rather be doing anything than traveling to Florence today to visit with the girl and the family who in sixteen short days would respectively become his wife and in  --  laws . Davido brought his thought full circle . He had already met the girl once and the notion that fruits so glorious were bound to waste their goodness and vitality upon an ignominious cause pained his heart exquisitely . <br> Davido took a few steps forward and set the basket of tomatoes onto the rear of the wagon , sliding it forward so to brace it against another basket . The wagon was nearly full with a dozen similar baskets : presents for old friends and a wife  --  to  --  be in Florence . She was n't at all like Davido 's late sister  --  shrewd , strong  --  willed , adventurous , beautiful  --  and she was nothing near what Davido had hoped for in a spouse . On the contrary , she was shy and skinny and she reminded Davido of himself when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florence holed up in the lightless Seminario di Ebrei for hours on end  --  and for this he could not stand being in her presence . She was a child , just fifteen or so , a good five years Davido 's junior and the youngest daughter of a successful merchant more than pleased to pawn off the last of his progeny to the grandchild of a legendary Ebreo like Nonno . <br> Though Nonno had explained to Davido a hundred times that this was the way things were done  --  that family knew best , tradition dictated the way  --  Davido was not convinced . He was repulsed by the girl , and the fact that their Chituba1 stipulated that they would spend the first year of marriage living together in the home of her parents , in Florence , was a thought so horrible it brought bile to his throat every time he thought it , and he thought it often . <br> Davido turned and walked to the rear of the barn . He knelt down and took a handful of hay and set it in the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to the large burlap cloth stacked with ripe tomatoes-close enough so that he could catch one more whiff of their beloved fragrance  --  and then , one by one , he began to gently set them into the hay  --  lined basket . A layer of hay , a layer of tomatoes , a layer of hay , a layer of tomatoes , two deep and well cushioned for the bumpy three  --  hour ride ahead . It would be a hot journey too , and though the sun had just begun to rise , Davido found himself sweating uncomfortably beneath the heavy robe he wore . With a curt sniff , he caught an anxious undertone in his sweat that always reminded him of rotting onions . Of course , a heavy wool robe worn in summer made him perspire , but it was the girl who caused his sweat to stink . <br> The monk 's robe was a necessary burden that Nonno had thought up many years ago while hiding about the cities of Tuscany . Nonno realized then that nothing protected a traveling Ebreo like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross dangling about the chest and a few well  --  said phrases in Latin . Hence , whenever Davido or Nonno or any of the extended family members living on the farm traveled to Florence , Pitigliano , Livorno or any other city , they did so draped in the hefty robes of Franciscan monks and pulled along by humble donkeys . <br> " By and by ! " Davido shouted to his grandfather to let him know the wagon was just about set . Davido spread a large burlap cloth over the back of the wagon . The tomatoes would be fine exposed to the sun , but it would be imprudent for a pair of false monks to openly travel with a cart full of Love Apples . It was unlikely that anyone they happened to cross paths with would know what a tomato was , but nonetheless , as Nonno often repeated , it was always best to keep suspicions at bay . Davido then walked into the barn to load a basket with some provisions : a loaf of bread ; a hunk of cheese ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a handful of figs and a half dozen peaches . He and Nonno would have tonight 's Sabbath meal with the family of his betrothed , spend the night with friends in the ghetto and then leave early Sunday morning for the return home , but they would need food and drink for the journey there . <br> Nonno heard a touch of anger in his grandson 's voice and it bent his lips into a wry smile . As of yet , the boy expressed no excitement for his pending nuptial . The day would be trying , Nonno was certain of that , and he took one more solid gaze upon his donkey for inspiration , when something about the absurd sight triggered his memory . " Mio Dio , " Nonno whispered as the bizarre and often heartbreaking life adventure that brought him from Toledo to Tuscany flashed suddenly before his mind 's eye : the three  --  month  --  long voyage aboard Cristoforo Colombo 's ship in search of a new route to the Orient , and the stroke of pure dumb luck ( Colombo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened upon an entirely new world instead . Nonno 's ten desperate years after being abandoned by Colombo on the island of Guanahani . His life , his wife , among the island 's natives . The return trip with Colombo back to Europe and his escape to Tuscany . The decade spent in semi  --  hiding while Spanish operatives searched tirelessly to discover the former finance minister who had so brazenly robbed Colombo of nearly half his treasure . The plague that ravaged Florence some fifteen years past  --  a horrendous scourge that took the life of his second wife , only son and daughter  --  in  --  law , and left him to raise a grandson of seven and a granddaughter of thirteen . But most raw upon Nonno 's memory was the life sacrifice his granddaughter had made , dead now nearly two years . Nonno closed his eyes and let his past wash over him with the first breeze of the day . <br> It was time , time to head to Florence , and Nonno inhaled deeply to inoculate himself against the ghetto 's summer stench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the strangest notion crossed his mind . It was a thought so visceral that his hand almost mimicked the gesture he had witnessed ten thousand times , and he contemplated how , if he 'd been born a Cristiano , this would be a perfect time to cross himself . Alas , Ebrei have no gesture like that , and as Nonno stepped to the wagon , he looked toward the heavens and sighed a slight " Oy "  --  perhaps an Ebreo 's equivalent to signing the cross . <br> " Hurry up ! " Nonno barked to his grandson in a tone more playful than serious . " Your wife awaits . " Nonno was sitting on the wagon seat with the reins to the pair of donkeys ready in his hands . <br> Davido did not smile back . He set the basket of food between them and took his seat . <br> Nonno laughed nonetheless as he snapped the reins , and the pair of donkeys began to trot down the carriageway . " Come , now , " said Nonno , " bad enough we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one too ? " <br> Davido looked away . He did n't want to give Nonno the satisfaction that his foul mood could be so easily cracked . " You 're jingling , " he said after the urge to smile finally passed . <br> " What ? " said Nonno . <br> " Your money vest . " Davido pointed to Nonno 's midsection . " I doubt a marauder 's sense of charity would extend to monks who forgo poverty , " he mumbled . <br> " Oh , dear God , " said Nonno as he simultaneously re-arranged his robe to quell the noise and shot his grandson a disapproving glance . " Do n't start that nonsense . " <br> " What ? " said Davido defensively , though he knew he was guilty . <br> " You very well know what . " <br> " I have no idea , " Davido lied as convincingly as he could . <br> Nonno frowned . " The rhyming . " <br> " Oh . " Davido smiled guiltily . " That . Sorry . " <br> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local village 's nasty old padre had prohibited Nonno and his kin from setting foot in his town , but they were nevertheless living among rhymers now and Davido felt he should do his best to master the odd local dialect . The funny thing about rimatori , Davido recalled from the country farmers who would set up their fruit and vegetable stands at the weekend markets in Florence , was how they clearly felt their way of speaking made them smarter than the city folk . To the citizens of Florence , however , Nonno included , the rhyming , antiquated Italo  --  Etruscan they spoke made them appear like bumpkins . As far as Davido understood it , all public and formal speech was meant to rhyme , and all intimate conversation  --  well , Davido had never had one so he could n't say and did n't much care . The truth was , Davido liked rhyming ; it was just one more thing about country living that set it apart from life in the ghetto . <br> " How much is it these days to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nonno . " Her father charged a hefty prezzo della sposa . " <br> Davido frowned as he turned his head to gaze over the land . The idea of having to buy something he did not want in the first place was beyond absurd to him . <br> " Tsst , " Nonno clucked , " the problem with youth is that you think of love and marriage like a lucky fool who goes for a stroll and happens upon a delicious fruit hanging ripe on a vine and prime for the plucking . All the sweetness with none of the sacrifice . " <br> Davido opened his mouth to speak , but no words came out . What difference would it make ? The die was cast , the bride 's price to be paid this weekend and the Chituba already drawn up . Nonno would never understand his aversion to marrying that skinny  --  ankled little girl . <br> " Good God , " said Nonno , breaking the silence , " do you think I am so old that I can not hear what the young think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But what of love ? " he blurted . <br> " Love ? " Nonno raised an eyebrow sardonically . " Look at me , I have had two wives in my life and I could n't stand either one . " <br> This time Davido could not help but laugh . <br> " Davido , " said Nonno , adopting a more thoughtful tone , " one does not love a seed , one plants a seed and tends to it . A plant grows , the plant bears fruit and we come to depend on the fruit for sustenance . God willing , after much effort and sacrifice you will at least come to acquire a taste for the fruit . And if you are truly blessed , like I was twice , the fruit will taste sweet and you will come to love it . " <br> Davido sat in silence as they trotted along the road that led to Florence . He had met this girl already and the only taste he could ever imagine was bland  --  bland with a bitter aftertaste . <br> Continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
