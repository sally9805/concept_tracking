Michael Corrigan sat in a windowless room at the Evergreen Foundation 's Research Center , north of New York City . He was watching a young Frenchwoman as she wandered through the Printemps Department Store in Paris . The surveillance cameras in the store reduced everything to black and white and shades of gray , but he could see that she was a brunette , fairly tall , and quite attractive . He liked her short skirt , black leather jacket , and her shoes-high heels with thin straps tied around her ankles . The scanner room resembled a private facility for showing movies . It had a large flat-panel video screen and speakers built into the walls . But there was only one place to sit-a butternut-brown leather lounge chair with a computer monitor and keyboard on a pivoting steel arm . Whoever was using the room could type directions into the system or slip on a phone headset and talk to the staff at the new computer center in Berlin . The first time Michael sat in the chair , he had to be guided through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveillance systems . Now he could do simple tracking operations on his own . The young brunette was walking through the beauty-care section . Michael had checked out the store a few days earlier and was hoping that his target would take the escalator upstairs to the Printemps de laMode section . Although surveillance cameras were n't allowed in the individual changing rooms , there was a hidden camera in the public area at the end of the hallway . Occasionally the Frenchwomen would come out wearing lingerie so they could study themselves in a full-length mirror . * * * Michael 's presence in the scanner room was just another indication of his growing influence among the Brethren . He was a Traveler like his father , Matthew , and younger brother , Gabriel . In the past , Travelers had been seen as prophets or mystics , madmen or liberators . They had the power to break free of their bodies and send their conscious energy-their " Light " - to other realities . When they returned , they had visions and insights that transformed the world . Travelers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern era a group of men called the Brethren began to identify Travelers and kill them before they could challenge the established order . Inspired by the ideas of Jeremy Bentham , an eighteenth-century British philosopher , the Brethren wanted to establish a Virtual Panopticon , an invisible prison that would contain everyone in the industrial world . The Brethren believed that once the population assumed they were being watched at all times , they would automatically follow the rules . The true symbol of the age was a closed-circuit surveillance camera . Computerized information systems had formed a Vast Machine that could link images and information to monitor large populations . For thousands of years , those in power had tried to ensure the permanency of their particular system . Finally , this dream of social control had become a real possibility . The Brethren had entered Michael 's and Gabriel 's lives when they were growing up on a farm in South Dakota . A team of mercenaries looking for their father had attacked their home and set fire to the buildings . The two Corrigan brothers had survived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after being raised by their mother off the Grid , the Corrigans ended up in Los Angeles . Nathan Boone and his men first captured Michael , and then Gabriel . They transported both brothers to the Evergreen Foundation 's Research Center . The Brethren 's scientists had built a powerful quantum computer , and the subatomic particles at the heart of the machine had enabled communication with the other realms that only Travelers had been able to explore . The new quantum computer was supposed to track a Traveler 's passage across the four barriers to other worlds , but a young Harlequin named Maya had destroyed it when she rescued Gabriel . Whenever Michael evaluated his new change in status , he had to admit that Maya 's attack on the Research Center was the crucial step in his personal transformation . He had shown his loyalty-not to his brother-but to the Brethren . Once the wreckage was cleaned up and a new security perimeter was established , Michael had returned to the center . He was still a prisoner , but eventually everyone in the world was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real distinction was your level of awareness . There was going to be a new alignment of power in the world , and he planned to be on the winning side . * * * It had taken only a few sessions in the room for Michael to be seduced by the power of the Vast Machine . There was something about sitting in the chair that made you feel like God looking down from heaven . Right now , the young woman wearing the leather jacket had just stopped at a makeup counter and was chatting with the salesclerk . Michael slipped on the headset and pressed a switch . Immediately , he was talking to the Brethren 's new computer center in Berlin . " This is Michael . I want to speak to Lars . " " Just a minute , please , " said a woman with a German accent . A few seconds later , Lars came on the line . He was always helpful , and never asked impertinent questions . " Okay . I 'm at Printemps in Paris , " Michael said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how do I get her personal information ? " " Let me take a look , " Lars said . A small red light appeared on the lower right corner of the screen . That meant Lars had access to the same image . Often several technicians were watching the same surveillance system or you attached yourself to the activities of a bored security guard sitting in a monitoring room somewhere . The guards-who were supposedly the first line of defense against terrorists and criminals-spent a great deal of their time stalking women through malls and then out into the parking lot . If you switched on the audio , you could hear them chatting to one another and laughing when a woman wearing a tight skirt was about to get into a sports car . " We can reduce her face to an algorithm and compare it to the photographs in the French passport database , " Lars explained . " But it 's much easier if we just pick up her credit card number . Look at your personal monitor and click the dedicated telecommunications option . Type in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , date , time-which is right now , of course . The Carnivore program will skim her number the moment it 's transmitted . " The store clerk slid the young woman 's card through a scanner and numbers flashed onto the screen . " And there it is , " Lars said as if he were a magician who had taught his apprentice a new trick . " Now double-click . " " I know what to do . " Michael moved the cursor to the cross-reference button and , almost instantly , additional information began to appear . The woman 's name was Clarisse Marie du Portail . Twenty-three years old . No credit problems . This is her phone number . This is her home address . The program translated from French into English a list of items she had bought with her credit card during the last three months . " Watch this , " Lars said . A box on the top right-hand corner of the screen displayed a grainy image from a street surveillance camera . " See that building ? That 's where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can handle the rest . " " If you scroll down the credit card bill , you 'll see that she paid for a visit to a women 's health clinic . Do you want to see if she got birth control pills or had an abortion ? " " Thank you , but that 's not necessary , " Michael said . The little red light disappeared from the screen , and once again he was alone with Clarisse . Carrying a little plastic bag with the makeup , the young woman continued through the store and stepped onto the escalator . Michael typed in a few directions and switched over to a new camera . A lock of brown hair rested on Clarisse 's forehead and almost touched her eyes . She brushed it back with one hand , and then gazed around at a new display of merchandise . Michael wondered if she was looking for a dress to wear to a special event . With a little more help from Lars , he could access her e-mail . The electronically activated door glided open and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army general and national security adviser who was currently the head of the Brethren 's executive board . There was something about his stocky build and brusque manner that reminded Michael of a football coach . Michael switched to another surveillance camera-goodbye , Clarisse-but the general had already seen the young woman . He smiled like an uncle who had just found his nephew perusing a men 's magazine . " What location ? " he asked . " Paris . " " Is she cute ? " " Definitely . " As Nash approached Michael , his tone became more serious . " I 've got some news that might interest you . Mr. Boone and his associates just concluded a successful field assessment of the New Harmony community in Arizona . Apparently your brother and the Harlequin visited this place a few months ago . " " So where are they now ? " " We do n't know exactly , but we 're getting closer . An analysis of e-mail messages stored on a laptop computer indicates that Gabriel is probably a few miles away from here-in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to search the entire world , but now we can focus on this particular location . " Becoming a Traveler had given Michael certain abilities that helped him survive . If he relaxed in a certain way-did n't think , just observed-he could slow his perceptions so that he could see split-second changes in someone 's facial expressions . Michael could tell when someone was lying , could detect the thoughts and emotions that everyone concealed in their day-to-day lives . " How long will it take to find my brother ? " he asked . " I ca n't say . But this is a very positive step . Up until now , we 've been searching for them in Canada and Mexico . I never thought they 'd go to New York . " Nash chuckled softly . " This young Harlequin is crazy . " And now the world began to slow within Michael 's mind . He could see a hesitation in Nash 's smile . A quick look to the left . And then a split-second twisting of the lips into a sneer . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding some fact that made him feel superior . " Let someone else finish the work in Arizona , " Michael said . " I think Boone should fly to New York immediately . " Once again , Nash smiled as if he had the high cards in a poker game . " Mr. Boone will stay there for one more day evaluating some additional information . His team found a letter during a search of the compound . " General Nash paused and let the statement linger in the air . Michael watched Nash 's eyes . " And why is that important ? " " The letter is from your father . He 's been hiding from us for quite a long time , but it appears that he 's still alive . " " What ? Are you sure ? " Michael jumped out of the chair and almost ran across the room . Was Nash telling him the truth , or was this just another test of loyalty ? He examined the general 's face and the movements of his eyes . Nash looked superior and proud-as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So where is he ? How can we find him ? " " I ca n't tell you at this time . We do n't know when the letter was written . Boone could n't find an envelope with a postmark or a return address . " " But what did the letter say ? " " Your father inspired the formation of New Harmony . He wanted to encourage his friends and warn them about the Brethren . " Nash watched Michael pace around the room . " You do n't look very happy about this news . " " After your men burned down our house , Gabe and I kept this fantasy going . We convinced each other that our father had survived and was looking for us as we drove around the country . When I got older , I realized that my father was n't going to help me at all . I was on my own . " " So you decided he was dead ? " " Wherever my father went , he was never coming back . He might as well have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrange a family reunion . " Michael wanted to slam Nash against the wall and slap the smile off his face . But he turned away from the older man and regained his composure . He was still a prisoner , but there were ways around that . He had to assert himself and guide the Brethren in a certain direction . " You killed everyone at New Harmony . Correct ? " Nash seemed annoyed by Michael 's blunt language . " Boone 's team achieved its objectives . " " Do the police know what happened ? Has it become news ? " " Why should you be concerned with that ? " " I 'm telling you how to find Gabriel . If the media does n't know about this , then Boone should make sure they find out . " Nash nodded . " That 's definitely part of the plan . " " I know my brother . Gabriel visited New Harmony and met the people who lived there . This event is really going to affect him . He 'll have to react , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 2 Gabriel and his friends were living in New York City . A minister from Vicki 's church named Oscar Hernandez had arranged for them to stay in an empty industrial loft in Chinatown . The grocery store on the ground floor took sports bets , so the store had five phone lines-all registered in different names-plus a fax machine , a scanner , and a high-speed Internet connection . For a small payment , the grocer allowed them to use these electronic resources to substantiate their new identities . Chinatown was a good place for these transactions because all the shopkeepers preferred cash to the credit cards and ATM cards that were monitored by the Vast Machine . The rest of the building was occupied by different businesses that used undocumented immigrants as workers . A garment sweatshop was on the first floor , and the man on the second floor manufactured pirated DVDs . Strangers walked in and out of the building during the daytime , but at night everyone was gone . The fourth-floor loft was a long , narrow room with a polished wood floor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a factory for fake designer handbags , and an industrial sewing machine was still bolted to the floor near the bathroom . A few days after they arrived , Vicki hung painter 's tarps on clotheslines , creating a men 's bedroom for Gabriel and Hollis , and a women 's bedroom for herself and Maya . Maya had been wounded during the attack on the Evergreen Research Center , and her recovery was a series of small victories . Gabriel could still remember the first night she was able to sit up in a chair to eat dinner , and the first morning she took a shower without Vicki 's help . Two months after they arrived , Maya was able to leave the building with the others , limping up Mosco Street to the Hong Kong Cake Company . She waited outside the street stall-wobbly , but determined to stand on her own-while an elderly Chinese woman made cookies like crepes on a black iron griddle.
