THE HILLS MTV , WEDNESDAYS , 10 P.M. E.T . Oh , to be young , beautiful and videotaped ! This sequel to rich-kids reality soap Laguna Beach follows LB 's Lauren Conrad to fashion school in L.A. She moves into a fabulous West Hollywood apartment , then interviews for and just happens to land an internship at Teen Vogue  --  you keep waiting for the scene in which a 10-carat diamond falls from the sky into her lap . With My Super Sweet 16 and Tiara Girls , The Hills completes a kind of MTV trilogy of princesshood . Yet it 's hard not to like Conrad , if only because compared with her idle , spoiled friends , she 's practically Horatio Alger . ( " I have a full-time job ! " says one guy pal . " I go out every night ! " ) Deadpan and gorgeously shot , The Hills is an addictively watchable visit to the cool kids ' table . <P> RESCUE ME FX , TUESDAYS , 10 P.M. E.T . Tommy Gavin ( Denis Leary , below ) is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul of his son , killed by a drunken driver last season . " He 's here , " Gavin fumbles , pointing to his head and chest , " and here . " She giggles : " That was really lame , Dad . " The scene is moving  --  Gavin so badly wants to make her , and himself , believe  --  yet hilarious . This firefighter drama , in its third season , is a black-humored study of why men lie  --  to themselves , each other , God , their families and women ( this season , including guest star Susan Sarandon ) . Leary is one of the few leads who could handle the whiplashing tones , and he has made the brave and selfish Gavin empathetic without excusing him . Rescue Me makes you laugh until and because it hurts . <P> DEADWOOD HBO , SUNDAYS , 9 P.M. E.T. ; STARTS JUNE 11 Law is coming to the mining settlement of Deadwood . But order is not . Seth Bullock ( Timothy Olyphant ) is running for sheriff in the town 's first election while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving in on the mining operations . Saloonkeeper Al Swearengen ( Ian McShane ) sees Hearst 's thugs as a threat to his crime-and-vice monopoly . " Bloodletting on my premises  --  that I ai n't approved  --  I take as a fing affront , " he says . HBO seems ready , foolishly , to let Season 3 be the western 's last . It 's worth hopping on this poetic , profane story of frontier money lust before it rides into the sunset . <P> LOVESPRING INTERNATIONAL LIFETIME , MONDAYS , 11 P.M. E.T . Work and love are two classic subjects for sitcoms , so it only makes sense to combine them . This improv comedy is set at an " lite Beverly Hills dating service "  --  actually located in Tarzana , Calif.  --  that is staffed by a neurotic crew of " relationship consultants . " Cast with versatile veterans of improv shows like Reno 911 ! , Lovespring also features a daffy string of customers both demanding ( a woman offers $10,000 to have her dog deflowered ) and satisfied ( " He learned some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The concept has been tried unsuccessfully before ( e.g. , UPN 's Love Inc. last season ) , but this loose , wry sitcom makes a crackling love connection .
