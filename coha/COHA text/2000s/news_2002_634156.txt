<p> In America , business ownership carries almost unlimited privileges . <p> What is outlawed is criminal mismanagement , in which executives and accountants conspire to defraud workers and shareholders , causing economic ruin . <p> But sheer mismanagement is legal . No law in America says an owner must run his business in a responsible , efficient and profitable manner  --  it 's no crime to be a lousy businessman who wastes millions of dollars because that business is just a toy to him . <p> Take Charlotte Hornets owner George Shinn . He figuratively has written a book on how to kill an NBA franchise , and fellow owners must decide in April whether to allow him to move his team to New Orleans , where the Jazz failed 23 years ago before moving to Salt Lake City . <p> Shinn 's is a chilling drama of mismanagement , hypocrisy and insensitivity . If you want to know how to destroy public trust , alienate your market and ruin a good business , call Shinn . Or read old newspaper clippings chronicling , among other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of basketball talent . <p> Former All-Stars Alonzo Mourning , Eddie Jones , Glen Rice , Larry Johnson , Anthony Mason , Hersey Hawkins , Otis Thorpe , Dale Ellis , Tom Chambers , Robert Parish and B.J. Armstrong once played for the Hornets . Most left unhappily . The Hornets drafted Kobe Bryant and traded his rights to the Los Angeles Lakers for center Vlade Divac . Two years later , they let Divac sign with the Sacramento Kings as a free agent . So they basically gave Bryant away . <p> For the first 10 years after the NBA sold Shinn the franchise rights for $32.5 million in 1987 , the Hornets averaged league-leading capacity crowds ranging from 23,172 to 24,042 . They were the NBA 's premier franchise in terms of fan support and the Coliseum was a snake pit for road teams . <p> Now , we no longer have any home-court advantage , " Hornets All-Star Baron Davis said . The fan support is so poor it feels better playing on the road . " <p> The Hornets are the only NBA team with a worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's losing about $25 million a year . When the city government refused to approve his request last year for a new arena  --  complete with the luxury suites owners swear they need to survive  --  he struck a deal with investors in New Orleans . Pending league approval , he plans to move the team to New Orleans next season just as Chicago billionaire Michael Heisley relocated the Grizzlies from Vancouver to Memphis . <p> Monday , Charlotte 's city council voted 8-3 to invest $231 million to construct a new arena to keep the team in Charlotte . Former Hornets player and Charlotte resident Muggsy Bogues , the NBA 's shortest player ever at 5-3 and a fan favorite whom Shinn eventually shunned , now stands tall leading the Save Our Team " campaign . But Mayor Pat McCrory says the council 's plan stipulates that the team no longer be owned by Shinn and partner Ray Wooldridge , whom Shinn chose over Michael Jordan . The city council said Saturday it is willing to amend that stipulation because it upset some NBA officials . <p> The e-mails I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a displeasure with the owners , " said Nelson Schwab , a leader of the city 's business community supporting retaining the team . Not the team . It 's not a displeasure with basketball . The owners are the issue . " <p> If the NBA allows Shinn to relocate to New Orleans , it might as well allow the Orlando Magic , Golden State Warriors and any other team wanting a new arena to leave and punish a market for a team 's mismanagement . Insiders say Shinn has brought so much dishonor to the NBA that other owners are inclined to support commissioner David Stern 's desire to keep the team in Charlotte . <p> I hope they do . <p> KNICKS IN NEED : Now that the NBA is thriving again in Los Angeles with its defending champion Lakers and surging Clippers , the league dearly desires the revival of the New York Knicks to strengthen its premier market . <p> With the Denver Nuggets going nowhere and star point guard Nick Van Exel still wanting to go anywhere , the Knicks , who need a talented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kurt Thomas ( or Clarence Weatherspoon ) , Charlie Ward and Shandon Anderson for Van Exel , Raef LaFrentz and Scott Williams or Tariq Abdul-Wahad . <p> The Knicks also would accept LaFrentz , Abdul-Wahad and Avery Johnson for Camby , Weatherspoon and Ward . <p> This would be the Knicks ' last chance to avoid missing the playoffs for the first time in 14 years . <p> LAKERS LIKE HARPER : Not surprisingly , the Lakers are inviting 38-year-old Ron Harper to join them for their stretch run . Still a tough defender and expert on the triple-post offense , Harper has been spared the grind of the regular season and would be primed for postseason play . He helped coach Phil Jackson win the Bulls ' last three championships and the Lakers ' last two . Jackson has always had a penchant for veteran defenders in the playoffs . <p> It 's appealing because that sixth ring would put me up there with Michael Jordan , and there are n't many people in that club , " said Harper , who would earn the minimum of $13,414 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much today 's young players do n't know about the game . He 's killing them with his knowledge . He makes fools out of them . Too many of these young kids get too much too fast and do n't really know how to play . " <p> ODOM UNDER WATCH : With forward Lamar Odom sidelined again , this time for four to six weeks with a sprained right ankle , there will be increased monitoring of his activities to make sure he does n't experiment " again with drugs . He has already been suspended twice in the last year for violation of the league 's substance abuse rules . <p> MAVS DENY RUMORS : Owner Mark Cuban and coach Don Nelson say any trade rumor involving the Dallas Mavericks is news to them . They 'd love to have a Karl Malone , Brad Miller or Marc Jackson if its does n't disrupt their core alignment of Michael Finley , Dirk Nowitzki and Steve Nash . <p> RUMOR MILL : Warriors reserve center Jackson is a tremendous distraction general manager Garry St. Jean wants to unload . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the Pacers , Magic , Suns and Grizzlies . They would deal him and a throw-in to the Knicks for Thomas or Weatherspoon and Ward or Anderson . <p> Elsewhere , players that teams want to move but are reportedly attracting little interest are reserve Grizzlies center Ike Austin , reserve Jazz center Greg Ostertag and Knicks reserve guard Howard Eisley . <p> INDISPENSABLE I <p> Allen Iverson , 76ers : Thank goodness Iverson , last year 's MVP and the league leader in scoring and steals for the second straight season , has missed only seven games this season with injuries . But the 76ers are 0-7 in those games . With him , they could win the East again . <p> INDISPENSABLE II <p> Steve Francis , Rockets : Everybody knew he was valuable to the team as their go-to guy and franchise player replacing Hakeem Olajuwon , who was traded . But few knew how valuable until the Rockets went 2-19 , with 15 straight losses , when he was out injured . <p> INDISPENSABLE III <p> Antonio McDyess , Nuggets : As their leading scorer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nuggets to a 40-42 record . But with surgery on his left knee sidelining him so far this season , the Nuggets are 15-32 without him on the court . <p> Kings at Mavericks ( Saturday , 7:30 p.m. , Ch. 5 ) : Two of the winningest teams in the Western Conference duel for another step toward homecourt advantage if they should meet in the playoffs . They are tied 1-1 in their regular-season series , each winning on the other 's home court . But Kings star Chris Webber missed both games with injuries . <p> STAT PACK <p> 15 <p> The career-high number of assists All-Star MVP Kobe Bryant had Tuesday night to go along with his 11 rebounds and 23 points in rallying his Los Angeles Lakers from a 20-point , third-quarter deficit to beat the Washington Wizards 103-94 . <p> 39 <p> Happy birthday Michael Jordan . He is the third-oldest player in the league . Utah 's John Stockton turns 40 on March 26 , and Houston 's Kevin Willis turns 40 on Sept. 6.
