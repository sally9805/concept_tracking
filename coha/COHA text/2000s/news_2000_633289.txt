<p> a new king , Elvis Presley , dethroned him from the top of the pop charts , Nat " King " Cole did n't become bitter or try to turn himself into something he was n't . <p> In a nod to the changing fashions , he simply added the satirical " Mr. Cole Wo n't Rock ' n ' Roll " to his nightclub act in the late 1950s . <p> That 's why Carole Cole admits she was surprised when she heard her father would be among the inductees last Monday to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . <p> " My initial reaction was that I was somewhat shocked , but that was before I understood that he was being inducted as an early influence , and then it made a lot of sense , " said Cole , who administers her father 's estate . " It obviously relates to his trio days . " <p> The Hall of Fame is not inducting the Nat " King " Cole most people remember : Not the suave crooner whose recordings of such ballads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endure 35 years after his death from lung cancer . Not daughter Natalie 's posthumous singing partner in 1991 's Grammy-winning " Unforgettable " and last year 's " The Christmas Song . " Not the man whose songs are heard in dozens of films ( " Sleepless in Seattle , " " As Good as It Gets " ) , TV shows ( " Ally McBeal " and " Star Trek : Deep Space Nine " ) and ad campaigns ( Acura , BMW and MCI ) from the 1990s . <p> Instead , the Hall of Fame is honoring the Nat " King " Cole who until recently was largely forgotten : the hip pianist and singer whose drummerless trio with bass and guitar was one of the most popular and innovative small jazz combos of the 1940s , an influence on future generations of jazz and rhythm and blues artists . <p> " I think that Nat ' King ' Cole should have been inducted a long time ago , but I 'm glad we finally got around to it , " said Seymour Stein , president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sire Records . <p> " I would say that his career in rhythm and blues was as strong if not stronger than his later career in pop , " Stein said . " Without question , the main component of rock ' n ' roll was rhythm and blues . . . and Nat Cole was one of the top R &; B artists of all time . " <p> After Cole stood up from the piano bench to sing and abandoned his trio in the early 1950s , its memory gradually faded . Jazz purists felt betrayed when Cole turned to pop , and he received only passing mention in jazz reference books . For decades , his trio recordings were practically unavailable . <p> But Carole Cole said the trio remained at " the core of everything my father did even after he crossed over " to become a pop superstar in front of large orchestras . <p> " I always believed that 's where his heart remained , which is n't to say he did n't enjoy and excel in being a pop singer , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment in the show when he would say , ' And now for you music lovers , ' and then he 'd sit down at the piano and jam with primarily a trio . " <p> In the past decade , the Cole trio has enjoyed a renaissance . There has been a steady outpouring of recordings , from the Grammy-winning 18-CD " The Complete Capitol Recordings of the Nat ' King ' Cole Trio " ( Mosaic ) in 1991 to the recently released " Live at the Circle Room " ( Capitol Jazz ) , a rare document of a live club date from 1946 . <p> Carole Cole says more releases are planned as the Capitol vaults yield up more treasures . <p> Some of the brightest stars on the contemporary jazz scene , including Diana Krall and John Pizzarelli , have acknowledged their debt with recordings that re-create the Cole trio 's instrumentation and reinterpret its repertoire . <p> And a new biography , Nat King Cole , by Daniel Mark Epstein , published last fall by Farrar , Straus &; Giroux , is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's formative years and contribution to jazz . <p> " The fact is that Nat 's pop music was so huge that it eclipsed the jazz music , " Epstein said in an interview . " There was a certain amount of snobbism in the world of criticism . . . that if a man or woman is popular then they could n't possibly be great . " <p> In looking closely at Cole 's pre-pop jazz career  --  as a triple-threat pianist , singer and small combo leader  --  Epstein concluded that he deserves to be ranked among the first tier of jazz greats , alongside Louis Armstrong or John Coltrane . <p> The biography describes how Cole 's father , a Baptist minister , brought his family from Alabama to Chicago during in the 1920s . Cole 's mother taught him gospel on the piano so he could play in his father 's church . But the precocious boy was soon sneaking out at night to stand outside clubs and listen to Armstrong , Earl " Fatha " Hines and other legends . <p> The biography re-creates one night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then known as " Schoolboy " Cole , more than held his own against Hines in a battle of the bands . Hines , who Epstein says " brought into jazz piano playing the complexity of the European musical tradition , " was Cole 's first major influence . <p> " Nat becomes the pianist who in the late ' 30s and early ' 40s creates the link between the Golden Age of Jazz and the bebop era  --  mainly by knowing what to leave out in his playing , " Epstein said . " Bud Powell , Thelonious Monk and Oscar Peterson were all very much influenced by Nat . He was a key figure  --  one of the five greatest jazz pianists . " <p> Perhaps Cole 's greatest contribution to jazz  --  creating the modern trio format  --  came about through a combination of luck and economic necessity when the 18-year-old pianist found himself stranded in Los Angeles in 1937 after a touring show fell apart . <p> A nightclub owner offered him a gig for a small group  --  with a bassist , guitarist and drummer  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny . Cole hired guitarist Oscar Moore and bassist Wesley Prince . <p> He shaped a new ensemble sound using what had been thought of in jazz orchestras as three rhythm instruments . Cole found the perfect musical companion in Moore , an early innovator on the electric guitar . When bassist Johnny Miller joined the trio in 1942 , Cole had the classic group that would help establish the fledgling Capitol label . They had a string of hits , starting with " Straighten Up and Fly Right " in 1943 , in which Cole 's singing became ever more prominent . <p> The trio 's legacy is more than a collection of reissued archival recordings . Its influence can be heard in the music played by a new jazz generation . <p> Pianist-singer Krall , whose newest recording , " When I Look in Your Eyes , " is the first jazz CD to receive a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year since 1988 , made her breakthrough with her 1996 album " All for You , " a dedication to the Cole trio of the 1940s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 12 years old , sometimes on a daily basis , " Krall said . " His trio influenced all of the people I 've admired and learned from , like Oscar Peterson , Bill Evans and Ahmad Jamal . Nat Cole is all over pretty much everything I do . " <p> Guitarist-singer Pizzarelli got introduced to Cole through his father , veteran jazz guitarist Bucky Pizzarelli , who led his own trio with piano , bass and guitar . The younger Pizzarelli has put his stamp on the Cole trio repertoire with two tribute albums , 1994 's " Dear Mr. Cole " and " P.S. Mr. Cole , " released last September . <p> " There 's no me without Nat ' King ' Cole , " Pizzarelli said . " There 's nothing dated about the trio 's music . The songs sound just as if he had made them yesterday afternoon in the studio . "
