WHEN THE CHURCH GATHERS ON THE NIGHT of Holy Thursday , its business is to leave the 40 days of Lent and enter the Triduum , the three days at the heart of the Catholic community 's life . So whether Lent has been strenuous or a disaster , we leave it behind on this Thursday evening . Ready or not , we begin the Triduum . What gets us in ? The gathered church does something this night it does n't do all the rest of the year . Perhaps that tells us : Pay attention . Here is the way we enter . We 're going into our three holiest days by taking off shoes and stockings and using soap and water and towels . We 're getting ready to proclaim the victory of life over death , getting ready to take the catechumens to the font and plunge them in , by touching each other 's feet . Sounds weird . SOMETIMES IT IS VERY WEIRD , IN my experience , the washing of feet on Holy Thursday has usually failed completely to do its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gospel . What did Jesus do before he died ? Take bread and wine and say words about body and blood ? Not the way John tells it . In John 's gospel Jesus washed everybody 's feet that night , and he talked a lot . One of the things he said : " For I have set you an example , that you also should do as I have done to you " ( 13:15 ) . Here was this very practical and lovely thing to do for a guest , this expression of service and care and just plain com fort and hygiene . Jesus denied none of that , but he added : " Whether you get all the parables and beatitudes and so on or not , here 's what it all comes down to . I 'm going to wash your feet . You do likewise . " BUT WHAT I HAVE SEEN SO OFTEN is n't this at all . It is a little play-acting of the gospel story , often with great care to keep the actual bare feet ( sometimes just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sight , easily done as the washees sit facing the assembly and the washers ( the priest and his helpers ) make a little moving cluster going from one washee to the next as fast as possible . The priest is Jesus , the others are disciples . The rest of us are an audience , spectators . From this mentality ( and maybe from a few notions of ritual purity ) comes the vigilance of some to keep any female feet fully shoed and socked-and all of them in the audience . But I have seen far more from Holy Thursday 's washing of the feet , and it has shaped me . I have been part of assemblies where it took an hour or more . At half a dozen places scattered around the whole room , people came barefoot and someone would wash their feet . Then each whose feet had been washed could choose to kneel down and wash the feet of another . Here is an old woman washing the feet of a child ( the old woman really knows how ! ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here is the teenager washing the feet of another teenager who is always there and always in a wheelchair . Here is a man in a suit whose feet are being washed by a man in a suit . Why not ? EVERYTHING WE BRING WITH US of the world , what we think of as " ourselves , " breaks down here . There is a different order taking root in us . And it is sealed with a kiss , but not the kiss of peace only . South African author Alan Paton captures it well when he describes in his novel Cry , the Beloved Country ( Scribner ) a white South African judge washing the feet of an African woman who has served his family : " Then he took both her feet in his hands with gentleness , for they were no doubt tired with much serving , and he kissed both of them . " That is how I have been helped to enter the Triduum . Now we are ready to fast and to vigil , to walk the way of the cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to wait until the dark of Saturday night , to gather around the fire and hear the scriptures , and finally to approach the font and go together to the table .
