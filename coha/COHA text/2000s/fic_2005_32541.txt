i Unbuttoning Lady X Delhi is a city where things happen undercover . A city where the horizon is blanketed with particulate pollution and the days are hot . A city with no romance but a lot of passion . You ask how passion without romance is possible ? The same way sex without a nightlife is possible . Delhi churns slowly , secretively . What emerges is urgency . In the Delhi I grew up in , everything happened . Married women fell in love with pubescent girls , boys climbed up sewage pipes to consort with their neighbors ' wives , and students went down on their science teachers in the lab . But no one ever talked about it . I used to be innocent , driven solely by the ambition to do something great for my country , something that involved physics . My knowledge of the facts of life was based entirely on books , and clean ones at that . I read nineteenth-century classics by George Eliot and Emily Bront . These books never went into any details . To remedy this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do this while standing in the scooter garage , which had been converted into a storeroom . I would sneak out with a flashlight after my parents had gone to sleep . The Kamasutra that I force-fed myself seemed completely of another world , alien and absurd . After I read it , however , magical things started to happen . In particular , I met a woman . We first met in my school . She had come to attend the parent-teacher meeting . I was the Head Prefect . " Where are the teachers for Class I ? " she asked . " In the Pushkin Block , ma'am , " I replied . I was susceptible at that age . I had been reading The Citadel by A. J. Cronin , in which themain female character was described as particularly handsome . I fancied for a moment that she was that handsome woman . " I 'll take you there , ma'am , " I offered . " What 's your name ? " " Anamika , " I replied . " I like your tie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fiddled with my polyester number while we walked , suddenly conscious of the ridiculous figure I must cut in my school uniform of red socks and shirtsleeves . Like most schools , mine had a strict dress code . The girls wore gray box-pleated skirts . Boys up to the age of fourteen wore knickers . Everyone wore a striped red and silver tie except for the Prefects . We wore a silver and blue one . I hated the ageism of Delhi and its antediluvian norms , which required you to address anyone older as Uncleji or Auntyji and anyone younger with diminutives . It precluded serious bonding with people older than you . I did not have the courage to ask this woman her name . She was of another generation ; that sort of thing was just not done . After I left her in front of the Pushkin Block , I felt my heart overflow with some kind of knowledge I could not immediately identify . I had imagined so many times how Newton must have felt when the apple dropped on his head and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt that way , that a great discovery had just been made and all I had to do was write down its formula . I wished a simple object like an apple had been involved , something tangible that I could contemplate and hold , smell and bite . I felt the urge to call her something . Something that no one else was called . A word that was not a name and that was still proportional to the immensity of the revelation unfolding within me . " India " was the first thing that slipped silently from my lips . I hung around that part of campus so I could catch her on the way out . Eventually she emerged from the same doors that had earlier swallowed her . I pretended to look elsewhere . She came up behind me and tapped my shoulder . " Do you like this school ? I am thinking of putting my son in it , " she said . " Yes . Extracurricular activities are encouraged . We have horse riding . " " Do you know how to ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Class II . " " I 've always wanted to ride horses . But with so many extracurriculars , will you still do well on the board exams ? " she asked . " I probably will . I love to study . " " You 'll do well no matter . You are obviously exceptional . " She looked at the Head Prefect badge on my left breast pocket and smiled . I shrugged . I was embarrassed but did n't want to show it . " I have to go now . Drop by if you want to chat . Ride your bike over . " " How do you know I have a bike ? " " I 've seen you bike around . I live in B-63 . Come for a cold coffee on Saturday morning . " " All right . " " That 's tomorrow , " she said , squeezing my hand , and left . I could n't place her . Indians , myself included , must immediately place everyone we meet . We are a nation of taxonomists . It must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are categories for everythingeducated or not , foreign car or not , brahmin or banya or what , English-speaking or not , meat-eating or not , if vegetarian then whether an eggitarian or strict , if strict then too strict to eat Western desserts with egg or not . All this in the case of women helps predict whether they might be led astray . In the case of men , whether they will misbehave with women given half a chance , take bribes , support their parents in old age , and on and on . The system works . It is a science , thousands of years old , that has been taken to the level of a fine art . I often scorned it , but if I had to put my hand on my heart I 'd have to admit that I operated by it . It was natural for me to classify people at first sight without even being aware of it . Love happens on the edges . It happens when one ca n't place someone ; so does hate . India was an enigma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanings and bountiful . That evening was like most other Friday evenings . I went with my parents to a dinner party . The ladies all sat in one section of the living room and the gents in the other . Thanks to my age I could mill around both groups . No other kids were present . My parents often took me with them to social occasions . Over the years I 'd gotten used to the company of people much older than myself . " Do you know a good servant ? Mine is going on leave for a month , " lady A said . " Mine is giving trouble , " lady B chimed in . " Servants these days , I tell you , " added lady C. I walked over to the other side where the men were discussing the India and Pakistan cricket match . I have nothing against sports , but men with thickening waists and a couple of artificial valves in their hearts discussing a five-day test match are not the most spectacular company . I went back to the women and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their ample midriffs gathering around the folds of their waists , the shapelessness of their backs clearly visible . I visualized them minus their small , tight blouses . One of the reasons for the accuracy of the classification system is that its criteria are always spur of the moment and can be tailored to fit the occasion . Each situation generates its own classification . For example , the most obvious question to ask when you unbutton an Indian woman 's blouse is whether she waxes her underarms . There are other less interesting ones , like what sort of bra she is wearing . This second question is not intrinsically uninteresting , but at that time there was just one company that made quality undergarments for women , and it made only five designs . I was able to classify most of the women at first glance . One woman , let 's call her lady X , was difficult to place . I unbuttoned her blouse several times in my head and tried imagining the two scenarioswaxed or not . Each seemed equally likely . I observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wax her underarms , it 's either because she 's terribly old-fashioned , or terribly postmodern . I could n't tell if lady X was a radical feminist . I was certain she was n't old-fashioned . If a woman does wax her underarms she might be very hip or just middle-class in her mentality . If I could get her type down I 'd know which parts of her body she depilated . Or if I knew which parts she depilated I could get her type down . The hostess announced dinner while I was busy unbuttoning lady X. I took the general movement around the room as an opportunity to strike up a conversation with her . In a minute I discovered that she read no books , went to the beauty parlor for pedicures , and did n't work . I lost interest in her . The inquiry was complete . She did indeed wax and was predictably bourgeois . I wondered about India , but the idea of unbuttoning her blouse filled me with such turmoil that I abandoned the half thought to the samosas on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India 's house the next morning , I agonized about what to wear . A lot of my clothes were still young and girlie . I chose my red striped boys ' shirt and jeans . I wore black boys ' shoes , slapped some Old Spice on my neck from my father 's toilette , and rode my bicycle over . I went at ten since she had n't told me when to come . Nine seemed too early for a Saturday . My stomach was knotted , and my back felt very tight . India was beautiful , and she was waiting for me . My tongue was jammed in my throat . This made polite conversation somewhat inconvenient . When she offered to make me a frothy coffee shake , I followed her into the kitchen and got ice cubes from the fridge on her orders . We took our tall glasses of cold coffee and went to the veranda in the rear of her house . I sat on the cemented ground at her feet , my shoulders leaning against the legs of her cane garden chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze . I was embarrassed by the thoughts I had had about her the previous night . It did n't matter that I had unbuttoned all the other women 's blouses ; only with India was there something indecent about it . We talked about my school and her son for a while . I had not discussed anything in this fashion with a grown-up before . My parents , their friends , and my teachers treated me like a kid , albeit a mature one . India was talking to me like I was an adult . " Where is your son ? " I asked . " Till I can arrange for him to change schools , he 's going to be with his dad . " She was divorced , and we were alone . Both facts made me unreasonably excited . " How long can you stay ? " she asked . " About an hour , " I said . I routinely went cycling for an hour on Saturday . If I stayed longer my mother would definitely ask me where I had been . India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know any women who smoked . I had seen women from the jhuggis smoke bidis , and once at a very snobbish party that one of my father 's work contacts had invited us to , a few women had been smoking . We sat quietly while India smoked . When she was finished she threw the cigarette stub by her foot and crushed it . " You have such thick hair , " she said , running her hand through it . My hair was out of control and , according to Sheela , a girl in my class , Jimi Hendrix-like . I had to wash it every day so it would n't get knotted . As soon as it grew down to my shoulders , the curls would take on a life of their own , and I would have to trim it . " Want me to put oil in your hair ? " she asked . I personally could not stand the idea of scented coconut oil dribbling down my scalp . The advertisements on TV for Parachute coconut oil were aimed at the likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no to India . Not ever and not for anything . " We 're having problems with our water supply , and I wo n't be able to wash it off , " I said . Then without thinking I said , " But I could put oil in your hair . " " That would be lovely , " she said . I realized I had made a smooth move . We went into her bedroom . She put oil in a small steel bowl and lay down on the bed with a towel under her head . As I massaged the oil into her black tresses , she let out little ooh-aahs of pleasure . I got absorbed in her glistening skin and in the way my fingers slid easily because of the oil . After her hair had soaked up the fluid I massaged the base of her neck . " An hour is up . I do n't want you to be late . Your mother will worry , " she said . I brushed my forefinger on her neck one last time and got up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an uncomfortable silence . I wanted to hug her , but my heart was making embarrassing noises , and if I moved closer I was sure that she would hear them . " I hope you 'll come again , " she said . I was taken aback by her formality . I mounted my bike and put my foot on the pedal . " Next Saturday , come early , " she said , patting the steel carrier behind the seat of my bike . Without turning around I made an affirmative noise in my throat . Then I pedaled away furiously . After I turned the corner I slowed down . I was not ready to go home . Between India 's house and mine there was a vacant plot of land where a building was under construction . The workers had built jhuggis on one end of the site . They lived there with their children . I decided to take a shortcut and ride my bike through this stretch to avoid the main road . One section of the plot was empty . I thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A good three-fourths of the way through I noticed a woman squatting behind a bush , no doubt taking a pee . I got off my bike and stood still . I did n't want to ride behind her and scare her . I tried to look away but could n't . I watched her peeing from the corner of my eye . Her sari was hitched up , and her ankles were visible . After a few seconds the woman got up , turned around , and saw me . Her skin was dark from being exposed to the sun all day . A fiery red line of sindhoor adorned the parting of her hair , indicating that she was married . She stared at me , and then in an exaggerated gesture she turned , lifted her sari all the way up to her bare ass , and jiggled her backside . I thought she was trying to spite me for having stared at her , but then she turned back around , looked me in the eye , and walked away .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
