The Ways of Learning // The mosquito is an automaton . It can afford to be nothing else . There are only about one hundred thousand nerve cells in its tiny head , and each one has to pull its weight . The only way to run accurately and successfully through a life cycle in a matter of days is by instinct , a series of rigid behaviors programmed by the genes .... The channels of human mental development , in contrast , are circuitous and variable . Edward O. Wilson , On Human Nature // Fritz wore very thick lenses in his wire-rimmed spectacles . He was an awkward kid who mostly liked being by himself . At age eight he was becoming an insatiable glutton for the printed word , devouring all manner of written nourishment wherever he found it . At first , his parents were vexed by his marathon stays locked in the bathroom , until they found out that that was where their eccentric Fritz felt most comfortable savoring his reading . Fritz came to see me because of some motor problems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his memory . // On several occasions , his mom and dad mentioned that Fritz was fascinated with gadgets of any kind . He relished getting his hands on whatever seductive apparatus was within reach . In the car he would studiously detach or disassemble ashtrays , loudspeakers , and door handles . His extraordinarily tolerant father observed that Fritz was much more talented and enthusiastic when it came to taking things apart than when putting them together ! But Mr. Powell did admit that his son was nothing short of remarkable at fixing objects around the house . // I was able to confirm this finding when one day I was doing a physical examination on Fritz in my office . He saw that one of the lights I use for examining ears ( my otoscope ) was not working . I told him it was broken and that I had changed the batteries and the bulb to no avail . I had also used a well-established , arguably primitive , Mel Levine technique ; in vain , I had shaken it repeatedly and briskly . Anyway , Fritz pounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix it for you . " Of course , I consented to the proposed surgery . Fritz then inspected the instrument , and thought out loud , " Let me see now , how is this supposed to work ? " I never would have asked myself that question . Fritz then used his fingers and his voice to trace and talk through the way an otoscope is supposed to work . Only then did he go back and determine where the breakdown was occurring . In doing so , he encountered a loose connection in the switch , which he remedied with leverage from one of his handy talonlike fingernails . What struck me and what I never forgot after that was that Fritz was unwilling to repair my light without first determining how such lights were supposed to work . I have since applied the " Fritz Principle " in my career . That is to say , I should never try to understand and deal with differences in learning until I know how learning works when it 's working . So I ca n't figure out why a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it ordinarily takes to master algebra - in other words , how that kind of learning works . // How Learning Works // The most basic instrument for learning is something called a neurodevelopmental function . Our own minds and those of our children are like tool chests . They are filled with these delicate instruments , neurodevelopmental functions , the various implements for learning and for applying what 's learned . Just as a carpenter might deploy different groups of tools to complete various projects or a dentist might use different sets of tools for different tooth tasks , our minds make use of different clusters of neurodevelopmental functions to learn specific skills and to create particular products . One committee of neurodevelopmental functions enables a student to master subtraction ; another squad participates in the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance , yet another neurodevelopmental task force makes possible riding a scooter. // A neurodevelopmental function may be one component of memory , such as the ability to recall things that have been seen in the past ( i.e. , visual memory ) , or it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pencil is located during each instant while you form that letter . The capacity to store and retrieve chains of information , such as the alphabet or the events leading up to World War I , is another example of a neurodevelopmental function . As you can surmise , the brain 's toolbox is vast , the total number of neurodevelopmental functions inestimable . On top of that , the range of different combinations of functions called upon to accomplish academic tasks is mind-boggling . In view of all these moving parts , it should not surprise us that breakdowns or specific weaknesses are commonplace . We call these deficiencies neurodevelopmental dysfunctions . We as well as our kids all live with our share of these flaws . Often the dysfunctions do not seriously obstruct roads to success . But sometimes they do . // Here are some examples of neurodevelopmental dysfunctions . Some children have difficulty writing , even though they have lots to say . They just ca n't seem to form letters quickly and accurately enough to keep up with their flow of ideas and words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their thinking or speaking . When kids write , their brains assign specific muscles to specific aspects of letter formation ; certain muscles are supposed to handle vertical movement , others create rotary movement , others assume responsibility for horizontal movement , while still others operate to stabilize the pencil so it wo n't fall on the floor while they write . Some kids endure agonizing difficulty with such motor implementation ; they simply ca n't assign the proper muscles consistently . Therefore , writing looms as a tormenting problem for them . This inability to assign specific muscles to operate in the right way at the right time during letter formation is a perfect example of a neurodevelopmental dysfunction . Other kids have trouble finding the exact words they need when they talk , difficulty remembering the associations between sounds and symbols when they read , or trouble understanding complex sentences and thereby following directions quickly and precisely enough in the classroom . Each of these deficiencies is a specific neurodevelopmental dysfunction and in each instance the dysfunction is likely to interfere with learning . // All too often a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As was the case with Carson , the assumption may prevail that somehow a floundering student is not really trying , that he is lazy , unmotivated , or , perhaps , even worse , that he 's " just not too bright . " A child like Nana may be discovered to be daydreaming and fidgeting in class , dreadfully out of focus . She is told she needs to start paying attention in class or she 'll get detention . She comes to believe she is somehow bad . No one seems to realize that her fragile concentration is a kind of mental fatigue or burnout ; she has neurodevelopmental dysfunctions interfering with her mind 's ability to turn on and keep up the flow of mental energy that she needs to concentrate in class . Her neurodevelopmental dysfunction is misread as a behavior problem when she has to combat serious mental fatigue . She 's an innocent victim of her own wiring . // Eight Systems // Approximately 30 trillion synapses or nerve linkages exist within the human brain . That crowded network allows for plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a nearly endless combination of neurodevelopmental possibilities . As we have seen , designated teams of neurodevelopmental functions join together to enable kids to acquire specific abilities . When one or more members of a team fail to show up or fail to do their share , performance suffers . Such negative results can bring on a backlash of emotional and motivational complications . Fortunately , we have the wherewithal and the knowledge to mend these problems before they get out of hand . // Schools and parents share the job of ensuring the healthy growth of vital neurodevelopmental functions . How then do we keep track of a mind 's growth processes over the course of a child 's school career ? The answer is that caring adults need to know how these functions are supposed to be operating year by year - just as they might be tuned in to a child 's ongoing nutritional needs or rate of growth . At first glance , staying on top of the many facets of a child 's mind development might appear to be a daunting , unrealistic undertaking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But do n't despair ; to aid us in our surveillance mission , all of the different neurodevelopmental functions can be sorted into eight manageable categories , or neurodevelopmental systems . In my work with schools and clinicians I have called these " the neurodevelopmental constructs , " but they are perhaps more helpfully thought of as the systems of a mind . // In medicine we are accustomed to thinking about overall health as the sum total of the health of various systems , such as the cardiovascular system , the nervous system , and the gastrointestinal system . Similarly , we can think about your child 's learning health in terms of the well-being of the eight learning systems I am about to describe . As with the systems that operate in our bodies , the neurodevelopmental systems are dependent on one another . They have to work together if learning is to occur , just as the cardiovascular system has to team up with the pulmonary system to promote the delivery of oxygen to various parts of our bodies . // These systems are like the major characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow and develop over their school years , we need to focus on the progress of the eight systems . At any point , the strength of functions within each system directly influences performance in and out of school . Systems change in their capacities . The functions can grow in their effectiveness . They can level off . They can deteriorate . Therefore , it is important that caring adults keep an eye on the progress in each system , promptly detecting and dealing with any important impairments or signs of delayed development . // The eight neurodevelopmental systems are depicted in Figure 2-1 . Individual chapters in this book focus on each system . But first , I will provide a brief description of each . // The Attention Control System // Jesse gets a traffic ticket for speeding ; he 's all riled up over it and defends ( pardons ) himself by proclaiming to his parents , " I just was n't paying attention to the speedometer . I had other things on my mind . " But Jesse often experiences such mind lapses , and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once pointed out , " That 's my Jesse . It 's absolutely incredible how he can be doing one thing and thinking about three other things at the same time ! He 's concentrating on everything but what he 's doing . " // Attention is the administrative bureau of the brain , the headquarters for mental regulators that patrol and control learning and behavior . The attention controls direct the distribution of mental energy within our brains , so that we have the wherewithal to finish what we start and stay alert throughout the day . Other controls of attention slow down our thinking so we can plan and complete tasks competently and efficiently . An example of attention control is a child 's ability to resist the temptation to think about the party she 's invited to tonight so she can concentrate on the word problem her math teacher is explaining . Attention keeps your child focused while filtering out distractions . Children vary widely in how often their attention controls function effectively . // The Memory System // Elsa keeps " bombing out " on tests or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have only one correct response . She recently flunked a quiz on plant structure despite studying like a devout monk . " I thought I knew all that stuff , but it must have just leaked out of my brain while I was sleeping . " Our school years involve more strenuous exercising of memory than at any other time in our lives . In fact , much more memory is needed for school success than is required in virtually any career . To varying extents , every course in school is a memory workout . And memory is downright complicated with countless little facets to go with the many different kinds of things we try to remember . Every student has memory compartments that serve him well , while other parts of memory bring on varying degrees of frustration . There are countless intellectually competent kids who unravel in school because they understand far better than they remember . Ironically , there are many students with superb rote memory who succeed with flying colors through their school years simply by regurgitating factual data . They may be far less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a starring role . // The Language System // Riley just received an A+ on a highly original short story ; he 's always gotten As in English and he loves to read and write . This guy makes most schoolwork look like the proverbial piece of cake . That 's because school is a perfect fit for born linguists like Riley . The language ingredients of learning include , among other things , the ease with which a brain detects differences between the forty-four or so different English language sounds ( an indispensable ingredient of reading skill ) , the ability to understand , remember , and start using new vocabulary , the capacity to express thoughts while speaking and on paper , and the speed of comprehension needed to keep pace with a seemingly supersonic flow of verbal explanations and instructions . Learning a second language is another example of an academic demand that calls for strong verbal capacity . Not surprisingly , kids who are good with language are more likely to succeed throughout school . On the other hand , those poor souls with even the mildest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agonizing pain trying to make it in our schools . // The Spatial Ordering System Marcus 's parents fret over his inability to distinguish left from right ; more often than not , he puts his shoe on the wrong foot . Marcus 's father once commented to me , " It 's as if this kid is completely lost in space . He never remembers where he 's left anything and he puts his shirt on backward more often than not - even when he thinks about it . " Also , his confused drawings in school are a source of shame to Marcus . These shortcomings reveal his weak spatial ordering . The spatial ordering system is designed to enable us to deal with or create information arranged in a gestalt , a visual pattern , or a configuration . Through spatial ordering we perceive how parts of things fit together . We are able to study and later recognize familiar shapes , their relative positions , and what goes with what to make a pattern , such as the letter " h " or an octagon or your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various material necessities of the day , such as pencils , notebooks , desks , locker contents , and other props needed for academic efficiency and proficiency . Spatial ordering calls for the use of closed circuits between our eyes and our brains , wiring designed to discern patterns and discriminate between them . People with strong spatial ordering are not likely to waste much time searching for lost objects ; they know where things are . On a more complex level , spatial ordering enables us to think with pictures , so a child hearing a story about Robin Hood can visualize the dramatic events , while a student in art class can picture the steps needed to undertake a ceramics project . //
