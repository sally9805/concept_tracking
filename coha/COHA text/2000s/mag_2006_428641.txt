The Astounding Taste of Fresh Food What happened to me yesterday - awakening to find myself in a kitchen that smelied like my grandma 's was n't something I 'd counted on when I decided to subsidize our grocery bill with a garden . Before I knew it , I 'd re-entered my childhood . I walked the lane to my garden day after day , planted , waited and replanted . Finally my harvest began . I got a canner and began making tomato sauce , pickles and relish . I froze corn , peas and beans , and shelled lima beans for the first time since I was about 10 . My kitchen smelied of strawberries , pickle brine , tomatoes , onions , peppers and cabbage . In all of this activity , I found a kind of peace and wholeness that eluded me when I was making hurried dashes through the grocery store and reaching for clean , attractive produce that got " rained " on periodically from the sprinklers above the displays . In the busyness of driving to and from work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . At first , my own garden produce was much less attractive than the kind I bought in town . It was amazing how much time I spent picking , scrubbing , peeling and otherwise preparing food . But I was completely astounded by the taste of fresh food , available day in and day out . Often I 'd sit down to a meal and remark , " Everything we 're having tonight is from the garden . " JOANNE LEHMAN Apple Creek , Ohio My Secret Weapon My four children are involved in a myriad of activities that keep us busy yearround . We have an extensive organic fruit and vegetable garden - a rarity in our situation where fast food is the norm . Why do we do it ? Initially , it started as " Mom 's hobby , " but over the years , I have realized something important : It gives my kids an edge . Feeding my family healthy , organically grown food , while others rely on convenience foods , makes my children healthier , smarter and stronger . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records , grades and medical records to prove it . Combined , my four children have missed fewer than 10 days of school . Their grades are stellar . I grudgingly reveal my secret to the readers of MOTHER EARTH NEWS ... I believe it has a lot to do with our organic garden . The thing I dread to reveal is the ongoing state of my garden . In this hectic lifestyle , there is minimal time to keep my precious garden weed-free , pest-free or immaculate . Our garden typically is a mess ! Thankfully the veggies still tend to grow . Our garden is not very pleasing to the eye , but we do n't let it stop us ! JACQUI COMING Double Oak , Texas Photograph Photograph // Companionship and Memories Aunt Lou is my companion , recounting witty stories as I tend my plot . Soft meringue hair and moonstone eyes ; artist and poet . I see her weathered red Formica counter and the " compost holder " that rested on it : a small cup that constantly spilled all manner of vegetable scraps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to her small garden and bury the day 's offerings with a broken shovel . This Depression kid did n't throw away anything useful . Her tomatoes testified to their good upbringing . Memories of Gram are all about food and hugs . As a child , we were coconspirators at the table , cackling and snorting at secret jokes . I would keep her company as she 'd bake with my mother , watching her gnarled old fingers working the paring knife around an apple , producing one continuous , exquisite peel . Laughter filled the room as we constructed pies . Later , Mom is with me as I tuck the seeds into their welcoming beds . We plot and plan what will be frozen and what will be canned , licking our chops . I see her facial expressions : concentration as she pushes the tomatoes into their jars , satisfaction as she inspects the finished product . Now , I grin happily at every " ping " that emanates from my cooling jars . My labs , Maggie ( yellow ) and Sally ( chocolate ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gardening goofballs , chasing frogs and stealing tomatoes . Performers , not farmers . I appreciate their show , basking in the warmth of both the sun and the presence of those who came before . CARA PROEHL Columbia Station , Ohio Staying Connected For me , gardening is somewhat of a guerrilla affair , as I employ methods that the people around me have never heard of . We had some compost and topsoil trucked in from a local garden center , and I spread it around the perimeter of our back yard . I did n't dig into the existing soil at all . We placed some landscaping material over the ground and then shoveled the imported soil over it . Another step I did n't take was to box the bed in with lumber slats or any other kind of constraint . No one believed that the soil would stay where it was meant to . I knew it would . The soil I use is very rich with organic material such as horse manure , straw and other unidentifiable humus . I planted a variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal rows but more like clumps . I mulched the plantings with dried grass clippings to help them retain moisture , then fertilized with blood meal and fish liquid . My garden is abounding with life - not only plant life but ladybugs , spiders and the like . By employing organic gardening methods and enjoying success with them , I 'm encouraging my neighbors and friends to do the same . I believe it is a small effort I can make in the struggle against rampant fossil fuel misuse , as well as creating a haven for the wildlife that urban sprawl displaces . It is a way for me to stay connected to the natural world . LEAH PATTERSON Calgary , Alberta A Wholesome and Rewarding Pursuit When we think of " gardening , " we think of earlier years when America was sustained by the family farm . Each family member was important and shared a common goal of providing for the survival of the family . Although nutrition is of vital importance to us , the training of our children is probably the most important reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best growing medium , nurtured along the whole process of growth and tended carefully as individual plants , soil is with children . Photograph // As we garden together as a family , we continually see the parallels between cultivating plants and raising children to be healthy , confident and productive members of society . Gardening together gives each of us , from the littlest to the oldest , a sense of belonging and purpose . As we share this common endeavor , we are tied together , each contributing as able to the overall goal : the productivity of the garden . Character is instilled with the challenges of hard work and planning and researching individual plant needs . As we sit around our table enjoying the tasty , nutritious fruit of our labor , we think of a time soon to come , when we shall also rejoice in the fruit that has been developed in each of our children . When we see the end product , we will know that all the hard work will have been worth it . Gardening is one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DAN and KELLEY SIEFKA Hillsdale , Michigan Gardening is Paradise Blue morning skies , ohia trees bursting with red blooms , afternoon clouds bringing showers and rainbows , a full-moon whale watch from the cliffs of South Point toward the vast Pacific Ocean - what more could one ask of paradise ? For me , the answer is gardening ! No matter where my wanderings have taken me on this lovely planet , life is never complete without a food garden . To observe paradise is incomplete . I must dig , plant , tend and harvest to truly touch the soul and life of any land . This is what I love most about growing my own food - the mysterious essence of life itself passing through my hands , entering my thoughts and heart as I watch each miraculous leaf unfold , each flower bloom , each fruit form . How can I put into words the taste of a ripe avocado from our orchard ? The pleasure of a bucketful of oranges every morning in May ? The brimming buckets of lima and green beans all summer ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The partnership that has evolved over the last 11 years has sustained me through trials and hard times . Depressed ? Go sit with the chickens in the free-range field and watch their antics . ( Chickens love to eat bananas and papayas , and nab live mice running from a mower ! ) Overwhelmed ? Spend time with the sheep in the macadamia nut field and adopt their stress-free pace . Grieving ? Do some watering in the tropical early morning light . Farming challenges abound - voracious insects , root rot , unbelievable weeds , unpredictable weather patterns and " regulars " ( zucchini , tomatoes ) you can not grow outside a greenhouse . But when all your successes finally grace your family 's table - well now , that is true paradise . PEARL MAXNER Naalehu , Hawaii Rare Native Seeds My gardening experience started with a small box of seed being placed in my hands by Momfeather Erickson . Short in stature but big on dreams , this Cherokee elder chose our family to put out the first heirloom garden for Mantle Rock Education and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cherokee community . The rare seeds came from archaeologists and tribal members . Photograph // Our Amish neighbor broke the virgin clay soil with his two horses . To enrich the soil , we added composted yard clippings , vegetable scraps and manure . Gardening organically called for learning how to furnish the plants with proper nutrients while keeping weeds down and bugs under control . We anxiously awaited the first sprout and carefully recorded the day it emerged , comparing each type of bean , squash , pumpkin and corn . Eventually , my husband and I had the wonderful opportunity to share rare vegetables from our garden with our community - ' Miami ' butter beans , Trail of Tears ' runner beans , ' Banana ' muskmelons , ' Omaha ' pumpkins . ' Black Aztec ' corn and ' Pawnee ' popcorn . Momfeather Erickson will use the ' Black Pawnee ' beans we strung ( left ) to make a feast with traditional " leather britches " soup this fall .

I now have a true understanding of why people dig gardening . MARILYN KONSTANTY Marion , Kentucky Blissful Connections Inexplicable joy ... This is the feeling I get when I garden . As a child growing up in the city , my parents afforded us the experience of having a small vegetable garden and even a few chickens and ducks . I dug the dirt and planted in the family garden but had little appreciation for the activity until my own garden healed me in a way I can not truly describe . I started this vegetable garden to grow some of my favorite vegetables . Then the need for ornamental flowers and shrubs began to call , and the garden chores began to swell . It was work and not very pleasurable at all . Then , in the summer of 2004 , my precious young nephew passed away after heart surgery . My family was devastated . I was lost . My 23-year-old nephew had been a chef and loved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was something that we shared and enjoyed . After he died , I expanded the garden and included a new section in memory of him . When I work in the garden now it is not a chore ; it is my time to connect with loved ones that passed on to me a love of gardening and of family . It is my time to heal and nurture . It is bliss . TRACY CARTER Nashville , Tennessee Giant Pumpkin Pride I remember with horror being awakened as a child on Saturday mornings at 6:30 to weed the garden . I could never understand my father 's pride in his garden . My father and I lost track of each other for several years . But we were reunited when I purchased my great-grandfather 's 1920s farmhouse from my dad . Soon I was planting my own small garden . My interest sparked Dad 's interest in me . He and I worked together to reclaim a three-acre parcel of the land in order to open a vegetable stand . These were awesome gardens ! Photograph // My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life 's ambition - to grow the world 's largest pumpkin . Even after being diagnosed with cancer , he maintained those pumpkins . My dad was in the hospital when he heard the news that he had broken the world record with a whopping 1,337-pound pumpkin ( shown at left , with Charles Sr. ) . Scott Cully , a professional pumpkin sculptor , contacted us about carving the great beast . That monster was carved and ready for the Guinness World Record cameras before Halloween in 2002 . ( It appeared in the 2004 book on page 46 . ) Dad was so proud as he sat with his great carved pumpkin for the news crew . He died in August 2003 , having been a great father , husband , grandfather and friend . As for me , I continue to grow my garden every year and try to inspire interest in my son and daughter . Sometimes when my family and I are gathered around the food that I have grown , I have a sense that my father is present . I hope that my children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , love for them . CHARLES HOUGHTON JR . Weare , New Hampshire No Better Feeling There is a kind of spirituality I find only by gardening . A special peace and solitude , a feeling of being one with the universe . The sun , warm on my back . The feel of soil , sifting through my gloveless fingers . The scent of earth and water . Tiny seeds carefully placed in pockets of moist compost , to emerge days later as wee green leaves . A rebirth each spring . Optimism is indispensable to having a garden . There must be trust that insects and critters will take no more than their share and confidence that there will , indeed , be a harvest . Each seed and every transplant is a gesture of faith . The birds and worms frequently get more peas than we do . Even so , I will plant them again next year . I can think of no better feeling than serving a meal made with my own fresh produce . I await the first radish each year with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked before frost always makes me a bit sad . I 've spent many winter evenings engrossed in seed catalogs . My husband says I seem happiest with dirt under my fingernails . I must say , I think he 's right . MARY CIBULKA BROWN Eastsound , Washington Photograph // Rare Foods and Relaxation After a busy day , the first thing that welcomes me home is the fresh smell of my garden . Full of joy , I pick up my shovel , till the soil , plant new seeds and pick some vegetables for dinner . All my stress melts away It seems like a miracle - green buds sprouting up from the ground . As an immigrant from Korea , I plant vegetables and fruits that are rarely found in the United States . It is a good way to introduce Korean foods to my children . The vegetable we are holding in the photo is ' Hobark , ' or Korean Winter Squash , ' which can be made into sweet soup and rice cakes all winter . Our backyard garden is my favorite place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its promise by presenting fresh green buds . Plowing the garden has given me not only a peaceful time to think and dream , but also great health . And that is why I shovel and sweat every single day .
