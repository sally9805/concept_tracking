Section : TECHNOLOGY CAR AUDIO Blazing new car stereo equipment is heating up road trips everywhere . <p> It 's not easy being a car audio engineer these days . You have to balance a fundamental commitment ot sonic quality with consumers ' ever-growing appetite for punishing sound . Add to that a shrinking amount of automative real estate and the challenges multiply . Here 's how some of today 's top companies are responding . <p> Alpine 's CDA-9815 CD head unit ( $500 ) bundles a CD player that can spin conventional audio CDs as well as M and WMA ( Windows Media Audio ) discs . To compensate for the loss of harmonics that occurs when music is compressed into M or WMA files , Alpine adds a Media-Xpander circuit that boosts harmonci levels across all frequencies to make music sound live . The unit also has an AM/FM tuner and can accept the feed from an XM Satellite Radio add-on tuner . <p> The CDA-9815 's 60 watts by four channels is considered high power for a head unit , although Todd Van Zandt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take all car-stereo amp ratings with a grain of salt since power can be measured and expressed in a number of ways . The CDA-9815 can reach 60 watts per channel at peak intervals , but its continuous power with low distortion is actually 27 watts per channel , compared with about 16 watts per channel for most amps . The 9815 also has three preamp outputs for add-on power . <p> Vehicle types and listeners ' sound preferences vary widely so Alpine has added its iPersonalize feature to the 9815 . You can boost or cut sound frequencies in the car to reduce unwanted resonances or to tailor sound to your taste . Another feature , digital time correction , allows you to control the arrival time of sound from the speakers so , for example , music from the passenger-side speaker can hit your ear at the same time as the sound from the driver side . You also can set the delay to make bass signals from a rear-mounted subwoofer arrive at the same time as the higher frequencies . The end result is a more cohesive sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process and allows them to store settings on a CD for uploading to the 9815 . <p> The subwoofer plays a major role in today 's car stereo . Driving bass lines in rap and rock music demand a big woofer that can reproduce frequencies well below the 100-Hz cutoff of most conventional car speakers . It 's not just punchy pop music that benefits from low bass . Orchestral music and jazz are more satisfying when the full frequency range can be played back with ease . <p> Ironically , while vehicles have become bigger on the outside , the amount of interior space has shrunk . Until now , if you wanted a subwoofer box in an SUV or minivan , you either had to relinquish storage space or mount a 6-in. - deep speaker into a 2-in. - deep door panel . Blaupunkt 's OverDrive ODw1200 Saucer subwoofer ( $299 ) solves that problem . The Saucer is half as deep as conventional 12-in. woofers and can tuck into spots where other subs ca n't go . <p> Tom Breithaupt , Engineer and Product Manager at Blaupunkt , calls the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combining a large cone with a shallow cone . As a result of the shallow depth , the woofer can easily fit into a side door , kick panel or center console . Blaupunkt recommends using the Saucer with a 200-watt amplifier and doubling the subs and amps to achieve the deepest lows down to 20 Hz to 30 Hz . <p> Amplifier makers also face space constraints - thus , multichannel amps are a good fit in most vehicles . JL Audio 's model 500/5 5-channel amplifier ( $900 ) shoots 100 watts to the left and right front speakers , 25 watts a side for " fill " to the rear speakers , and a beefy 250 watts to the subwoofer channel . <p> The JL 500/5 features the company 's Regulated Intelligent Power Supply ( R.I.P.S. ) system , which delivers the same power regardless of the impedance , or resistance , of the speaker it 's matched with . " That gives consumers all the power they paid for , " says JL Audio President Andy Oxenhorn . <p> The amp is a hybrid design . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance but gives off a ton of heat , for the front and rear speakers and a Class D amp , which is more efficient by nature for the sub channel . The hybrid approach brings audio fidelity to the sonically critical mid and high frequencies . At the bass level , where sonic performance is less critical , the Class D amplifier runs cooler , requires a smaller heat sink and can fit into a smaller space . <p> Many head units tout high power , but typically those specs measure peak levels and do n't include distortion measurements . JL 's power specs represent low-distortion power at continuous levels . If you try to push a typical head unit to its maximum power level , you hear a flapping or warbling sound because its amplifier ca n't sustain that level for extended periods . An add-on amplifier like the 500/5 gives you space to crank up the volume without producing the distortion of an overtaxed system . <p> Consumer demand for volume puts pressure on speaker companies too . " The biggest thing the consumer wants to do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Director of Car Audio Brand Marketing for JBL . " Engineering speakers that will play loud yet maintain sonic decorum is one of the big challenges we face . " <p> JBL 's P652 loudspeaker ( $230 a pair ) uses its Plus One cone technology , which has enabled engineers to increase the size of a cone while fitting it into a standard-size enclosure . A cone on a typical 6-in. speaker is actually about 5 in. in diameter , says Dragon , but JBL retooled the cone 's housing to fit a 5.75-in. cone in the same amount of space . " More cone area means more bass output , higher efficiency and less power required to drive them , " he says . <p> Like many of today 's speakers , the JBL P652 features a pivoting tweeter , allowing installers to control the direction of the high frequencies for better stereo imaging of the left and right speakers . JBL 's ratchet design holds the tweeter in place during bumpy rides . <p> If CD head units , amps and speakers are the foundation of car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . Rockford Fosgate 's OmniFi offers a glimpse of the custom entertainment options to come . OmniFi lets you download music and other audio programming from your PC and bring it into your car . You 'll still use your head unit for control and CD playback , but the OmniFi 20GB hard-disk recorder gives you a daily refresh of music and Internet audio . <p> Tom O'Mara , Managing Director of OmniFi , sees this product as the great liberator of consumers ' music collections . " People have these great libraries of music on PC but that 's not where they listen to music , " he says . " We used to be limited to a 10-disc changer and awkward navigation in the car , " he says . " Now you can get text information about the music , and you have access to thousands of tracks . " <p> For ' burb dwellers , the OmniFi never has to leave the car if the receiver is within 150 ft. of the home PC , because the unit packs an 802.11b wireless receiver that can network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its car dock and connect via USB to a PC . With the OmniFi service , you schedule a sync to occur each morning , and music you 've stored in a queue - along with news or sports updates - is downloaded to the unit . <p> The OmniFi system - including the player , housing , cables and a dash-mountable controller with 3-line LCD readout - is priced at $599 . A subscription for news feeds is $5 per month , or $50 a year . <p> Tired of the same old factory radio ? It 's time to pump up the volume and take your tunes on the road . <p> " The biggest thing the consumer wants to do is to play his system louder .
