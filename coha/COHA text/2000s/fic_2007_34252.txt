Chapter One Maggie recognized menace as it slid over DC 's face right before the female tank , shielded by her groupies , slammed her against the chain-link fence . " Too late to run , Miss Prissy White Girl . I been waitin ' for you . " Trying to swallow with the woman 's forearm pressing against her throat , Maggie clutched at the woman 's arm . Someone , guard , please . Already spots floated before her eyes . Air , I need air . " That 's enough . " Maggie heard the words from a distance , and air , blessed air returned to her lungs as DC lurched backward , propelled by a black hand sunk into her shoulder . " Beat it . " Kool Kat hissed as she slid in front of Maggie . Both women smiled and kept their voices low so as not to attract the attention of the correctional officers , who were safe in their bulletproof shelter by the fence . She turned to Maggie . " Keep walkin ' like nothin ' wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear flailing her shoulders like a crazed jockey . After the big black woman sauntered back to the exercise yard population , Maggie rubbed her throat . Four months until her review by the parole board and she 'd almost not lived to see it . She tried to breathe evenly to calm the deep trembles . Sevenyears of keeping her head down , three of them here at Los Lomas and she 'd only this once had any trouble . She 'd been afraid at her sentencing , afraid of being alone with her memories , afraid with the terror of a normal woman-as she used to see herself-in an abnormal environment . But now , with DC having marked her , she knew real fear . " Roberts , I 've got something for you . " Ms. Donelli , head of the occupational programs , beckoned from The Bubble where the correctional officers stayed , watching the prisoners in the concrete exercise yard . DC had made sure none of the COs had seen her little activity . There was always a way not to be seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of them . She trotted over to the gate , managing a wave at the correctional officer who checked her name off the roster as she passed through the gate . " What 's up ? " Maggie asked , voice still raspy from the attack . At five-five she felt like a dachshund next to a Great Dane . Elegant was the word for Ms. Donelli , a word and concept Maggie had left behind with her entry into the penal system . They entered the three-story , cut-stone building that housed A wing and climbed two flights of concrete stairs . Even with freshly painted green walls , the bars on the windows screamed prison . " A new program . You 're a fit . Parole in four months instead of release in a year and a half . " Ms. Donelli smiled down at Maggie and nodded at another inmate they met . Smiles were a precious commodity in Maggie 's life so she horded this one , just like she had done since the accident that sent her here . " Your record 's good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day sat at the front desk and greeted them both as they turned down the hall to the offices . Which meant she 'd stayed out of trouble with both inmates and staff . Until today . How fast would the grapevine travel and this carrot be removed ? " And I heard you like horses . " " I did ... as a kid . " Donelli ushered Maggie into her private office and motioned to sit beside her on a love seat that , like the other furnishings in the room , had seen better days . Donelli lived by the rule she touted . The budget was better spent on helping inmates than decorating offices . " An organization called The Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation has contracted with us to rehabilitate horses that can no longer race for one reason or another . The program pioneered in New York , but we will be the first one in a women 's prison . If you agree to do this , you will care for the horses along with taking classes in stable management . " " So are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the beef ranch ? " " Yes , they 'll actually be appropriating the unused barns at the beef ranch . Are you interested ? " Pictures of the horses she 'd cared for at the riding stable in her teens flashed through her mind . Dusty with the loose lower lip who loved lemon drops ; Jefferson who nosed her pockets for carrots ; old Silver who acted like he was going to kick the daylights out of you but once you laid a hand on his rump , nickered a soft hello . Did she want to work with horses again-did dogs bark ? A tiny sliver of-what ? excitement ? - shivered down her spine . " Yes , please . " She brushed a straw-like hank of hair from her eyes . It needed trimming with her nail scissors again . She 'd realized that anyone who had known her as the wife of a rising executive and stay-at-home mom would n't recognize her now . Back then , she 'd known she was attractive with sun streaked brown hair and laughing blue eyes . Her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirror said mousy , nondescript-a perfect cover for safety 's sake . " Good . We 'll be starting with ten inmates and ten horses . Our occupational trainer is a man named Trenton James . He 's managed horse farms for years . Comes highly recommended as both a teacher and a trainer . " " When do we start ? " " Tomorrow . " Tomorrow she would be safer-far away at the barns-safe from DC . Even though she knew no one was ever really safe on the inside of prison fences . " Thank you . " " You 're welcome . Do you have any suggestions for others who might be interested ? " The immense bulk of Kool Kat plucking DC 's arm off Maggie 's throat skittered across her mind . She owed a debt . " Kool Kat . " Donelli seemed surprised by the suggestion . Everyone knew Kool Kat was regarded as one of the tougher prisoners and had been called many uncomplimentary names by more than a few . Starting in her teens , she 'd been incarcerated enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of her own . " She 's inner-city LA , probably never seen a horse in real life , " Donelli said dismissively . " I know , but she told me once when we were working in the kitchen that she likes animals . She 's a hard worker . " And strong as a sumo wrestler , fortunately for me . " I 'll consider it . " Maggie knew that possibly doing someone a favor was stepping out of character and might cost her . She 'd lived her life in prison by the words an old woman told her when she first came in : " Just get through . " Staying to herself all these years had gotten her through . But Kool Kat had saved her life . It was n't the same as conferring favors with contraband perfume . This was different . Besides , she had read that change started in the mind . No matter if she was in prison or not . The next morning Maggie joined the small group waiting for the van to take them to the beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm . Kool Kat , her black hair braided and looped in intricate swirls , stopped beside Maggie . She lowered her voice . " What you be wantin ' ? " Keeping her eyes directed toward the floor , Maggie whispered back . " We 're even . " The snort from the woman who dominated the prison yard made her wonder if she 'd done the right thing . She 'd seen firsthand what happened when someone crossed Kool Kat ; that woman 's face bore a scar for life . A broad shouldered man with the standard issue clipboard strode through the door . Square jawed with a golden tan that matched his short-cropped hair and eyes that crinkled , he wore assurance and contentment like a longtime favorite shirt . He stopped by the desk and waited for the conversations to cease . " I 'm Mr. James and I 'm the occupational trainer with this new program . Please answer when I call your name , and we 'll get on the road . " He was dressed in jeans and a blue plaid western shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and timber of his voice set Maggie at ease . Maggie 's name was fifth . " Here . " She raised her right hand . At his nod , she followed the others out the door to the waiting bus . While she 'd been so careful not to get involved , Maggie knew all the women who 'd agreed to the program . Blonde Sim was in for bank robbery ; she 'd driven the getaway car and missed her two kids so badly she 'd do anything to keep out of trouble . Like Maggie , parole was a possibility in the near future . Petite JJ with the charming smile and dubious methods of anger management ; Brandy , the youngest of them all , in for possession and dealing , wore cockiness like armor and had gotten on the bad side of the COs ' more than once . Were n't there supposed to be ten women ? Maggie 'd only counted nine . As she turned around to sit down in the middle seat next to the window , she heard Mr. James talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus . Maggie 's stomach leaped to her mouth , and it was all she could do not to hurl the cold cereal she 'd eaten at breakfast . DC swaggered in , her gaze riveted on Maggie . For the veriest of seconds , she slowed by the bench seat where JJ sat next to Maggie . DC was up for possession and armed robbery , along with other violent crimes , but like many others she said she 'd been framed . Her record in prison according to the COs sounded like she sang in the church choir , but the inmates knew better . Her infrequent smile sported two gold front teeth . The door shut and another man took the driver 's seat while Mr. James stood in the well by the door . " First of all , our driver is my assistant , Mr. Creston . Besides driving , he 'll be in charge if for any reason I have to be absent . Next I have some announcements to make . We 'll be going by the prisoner 's handbook , which I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few additions . Number one : there is no second chance . If you mistreat either animals or humans , you are out of here and back to the yard . I 'll teach you all that I can , but like the saying goes : you can lead a horse to water , but you ca n't make him drink . You can lead a man-or a woman in this case-to knowledge , but you ca n't make her think . " He paused and looked them each in the eye . " I hope you ... well , learn all you can . It 's the first time this program has been offered to women . Women have a reputation for good intuition with horses as well as compassion . Horses are honest , what you see is what you get , not like humans who play games . If you have trouble with a horse , you might want to look inside yourself and see if you can figure what he sees and is reacting to . " Maggie let his words sink into her mind . Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy , but look inside herself ? She shuddered . She 'd spent the last seven years avoiding herself , along with all the groups ' and counselors ' probing-just getting through . The bus stopped in front of a long , low shed . " You 'll be helping some men who have volunteered to build stalls and fencing . Horses have a knack for tangling up in wire so we 're installing all wooden fences here . We have ten days to get ready . I 'll be checking out the tools , and at the end of our session , you need to check them back in . Can I see a show of hands if you 've ever used a hammer ? " He counted and nodded . " And a saw ? " Noting something on his clipboard he led the way down the stairs . As they filed down the three steps he said their name and pointed either to the left or the right . " Ms. Jackson . " " Kool Kat , " she replied , meeting his eyes . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . " " Mr. James . " " Yeah , Mr. James , that 's what I said . " At his smile , a spate of chuckles blew through the group . He nodded toward the left . " Ms. Roberts . " " Maggie . " " Maggie it is . " He nodded for her to follow Kool Kat . The driver of the vehicle handed them each a hammer . " You 'll find nails at the building site . Follow the instructions of Mr. Hansen , he 's the foreman . " Maggie nodded and sucked in a deep breath of real air . Air not tainted by chain-link fences topped with concertina wire and the hot concrete of the yard , nor by the misery and hostility of those inhaling and exhaling . Free air that had passed over pastures and lingered in the trees . She inhaled again and raised her face to the sun . Soon she would be breathing free air 24/7-if they granted her parole and DC did n't kill her first . She 'd always loved being outdoors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camping and hiking , they 'd loved the mountains , especially the Sierras . She blinked in the dimness of the building before her eyes adjusted from the sun . A stack of rough-sawn lumber filled the aisle in front of timbers that were already concreted into the dirt floor . Sawhorses topped with sheets of thick plywood held a chop saw where two men were cutting the boards to the proper lengths . " If you 'll come on over here , " another man called , beckoning them to one of the stalls . " We 're nailing the walls up ; the nails are in the bucket . Put three nails in each end , like the one you see here . The sooner you learn to hit the nails square , the faster they 'll go in . I take it you 've all used hammers before ? " Maggie nodded as she looked at the stack of boards . From the size of it , she 'd be nailing until she got paroled . Tapping nails to hang pictures with her husband did n't look to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An hour later , with repeated help from the foreman , Kool Kat and Maggie began to make progress , although their fingers and thumbs bore witness to their inexperience . By the time they had to return to the correctional facility for head count and lunch , her back ached , her thumb throbbed , and they had nailed one wall up to six feet . " We ahead of the others . " Kool Kat returned from looking at the other stalls . Maggie stared at her partner . " We 're not in a race here . " Kool Kat leaned into Maggie 's face , her voice taking on a hiss . " I play , I win . " The threat made Maggie take a step backward . And they were supposed to be partners ? She headed for the bus , keeping a watch out for both Kool Kat and DC . " Good work , ladies , " Mr. James said as they filed off the bus . " See you in a few . " " Not if I see you first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going back ? " Maggie asked , hope flaring . " Course I 'm goin ' back . " A fierce look accompanied her reply . " But I never worked so hard in my entire life . Feels like my arm 's about to fall off . " " I wish mine would . " Maggie flexed her right arm and stretched her neck from side to side . When she looked at her palm , the blisters were no surprise . Kool Kat raised hers , and even though she had dark skin , the seeping showed . " I 'll get us bandages and leather gloves . " Kool Kat said matter-of-factly . Maggie knew Kool Kat had ways of getting things . " Us ? Why would you do that ? " " Simple . I do n't quit . " She paused , her eyes narrowed . " And these partners are gon na win . " She tapped Maggie on the shoulder . Maggie heard the unspoken words , " at any cost . " Nine more days until the horses , four months until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that . Ten days later the remaining nine women-one had backed out-were lined up as a horse van pulled into the driveway . Ten stalls , all with doors that swung on hinges , with sliding latches waited for the guests . Maggie and Kool Kat had put up more boards than all the others put together , and they both had the muscles and calluses to prove it . Maggie often felt like she was being towed along by a freight train . DC brushed by Maggie , bumping her with her hip . Maggie went sprawling . Mr. James turned . " Sorry , clumsy , " Maggie lied , getting to her feet , not looking at DC . As the first Thoroughbred limped down the ramp , Kool Kat backed up . " What they bring us , giants ? " Maggie rolled her eyes and shook her head . What was that feeling in her face ? Her lips even twitched . " This is Dancer 's Delight , eight years old and won $750,000 in his years on the track . If you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow in his tendon . Maggie , since you 've worked with horses before , you take him to stall ten . " Blinking back something in her eyes , Maggie walked forward and stopped in front of the horse , allowing him to sniff her hand and up her arm . She reached slowly for the lead shank . " Easy fella , you 're safe now . " Shank in hand , she led him around the van to the stalls , half listening to Mr. James ' voice as he used her as an example on how to handle the horses .
