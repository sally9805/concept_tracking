The Urdu phrase is Shadeed Garmi , extreme heat . It was 120degreesF last week in Delhi , 110degrees in Islamabad and well over 100degrees in Kashmir . For the Indian grenadiers of the J.K. Light Infantry regiment and the Pakistani troopers of the 15th Northern Division entrenched on opposite sides of Kashmir 's Line of Control , the torrid weather made for itchy trigger fingers and an eagerness to join the battle  --  anything would be better than pointlessly sweltering in full battle gear . For Calcutta day laborers and Lahore rickshaw drivers , the unseasonably warm weather meant abandoning the bricklaying or cruising for fares and squatting in the shade of wilting bodhi or neem trees to chat and stoke their suspicion and hatred of their neighboring nation . And for the nations ' leaders , India 's Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in his New Delhi bungalow and Pakistan 's President Pervez Musharraf in his Rawalpindi villa , central air conditioning may have alleviated the high temperatures , but both men were scorched in the searing glare of the showdown , the Pakistani especially . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political future , his countrymen take his measure , his handling of this latest Kashmir crisis could be a defining moment . Pakistan 's general turned dictator now finds himself on the hottest seat of all . <P> The issue this time , as it was in January and in two wars since the departing British partitioned the subcontinent in 1947 , is Kashmir . On the Indian side , Jammu and Kashmir have a Muslim majority , which fuels Pakistan 's claim over the territory . Hindu India , anxious to prove its secular credentials , refuses to let go , clinging on with a mix of high-handed vote rigging and indifference to public opinion .

The cause is seen by some in Pakistan as a jihad , a holy war ; it is viewed with clarity and single-mindedness of purpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be argued , have failed their people over the years  --  literacy is only around 40% , and infant-mortality rates are among the world 's highest  --  is now tied dangerously to this holy war , or this terrorism , depending on who is doing the talking . " This is the red line of Pakistani politics , " says retired Pakistani army lieutenant general Talat Masood , " the one issue on which we can never back down . " <P> The standoff is causing concern inside the Bush Administration too . A skirmish over Kashmir could easily accelerate into a broader war . The remote but frighteningly thinkable worst-case scenario would see the two sides escalate in stages to an exchange of nuclear weapons . But even short of that unlikely cataclysm , the seriousness of the dispute requires American diplomatic attention and threatens to affect Washington 's war on terror , particularly as Pakistan moves troops away from its western border with Afghanistan to the Kashmir front . U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage is scheduled to visit India and Pakistan this week to lean on both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donald Rumsfeld 's turn to journey to the region and remind both parties that mutually assured destruction means just that .
