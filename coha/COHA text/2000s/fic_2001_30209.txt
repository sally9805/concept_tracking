Ashes of Aries By Martha C. Lawrence Minotaur Books The hot Santa Ana swept across the open desert , hissing through the bone-dry cheatgrass and shaking the stiff sagebrush . I did my best to ignore it . There was a red and white bull's-eye target tacked to a hay bale ten yards away . I was trying to keep my attention focused there . Willpower , girl . Mind overmatter . You can do it . I locked an unblinking stare onto the target , drew back the bow string , and let the arrow fly . The slim , feathered spear shot forward but caught the breeze and veered left , missing the hay bale entirely . I sighed in exasperation . " Great . What am I now , zero for six ? " The wind whipped a shank of hair across my eyes and I called it the F word . As if to mock me , the gust grew in strength , sending up a flurry of straws around the hay bale . Sequoia stood motionless beside me , his long , black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name suits him well . Sequoia is broad and tall , with skin the deep color of redwood . Like the ancient tree , something about him inspires reverence . " This is n't about keeping score , Elizabeth . This is about using the power around you . " Spoken like the twenty-first-century medicine man that he is . A distant cousin of my best friend , Thomasina , Sequoia has lived most of his life on the Temecu Reservation east of San Diego . He claims to have learned his shamanic powers in Mexico from a mysterious woman he calls Aunt Christina . I believe he used those powers to save my life a few months ago . It 's rare that I meet someone more versed in the unseen realm than I , which is why I 'd signed on as his unofficial student . I still was n't clear what archery had to do with shamanism , but had a feeling I was going to find out . " What power would that be ? " I asked . " The wind . Do n't fight it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrow from the leather pouch strapped to his thigh and handed it to me . I gave him a dubious look as I placed the notched end of the arrow onto the string and drew back the bow . The wind blew steadily , rustling the cheatgrass . I aimed at the target , corrected for the breeze , and concentrated . Harness the power around you . The gust picked that moment to die and my arrow sailed right past the hay bale , missing by an embarrassing distance . Something inside of me snapped . I pulled my Glock out of my waistband , set my sights on the target , and blew three hollow-points into dead center . The gunshots reverberated in the open air and left my ears ringing . I confess the release felt wonderful . " There , " I said . " How 's that for using the power around me ? " Sequoia lifted his Wayfarers off the bridge of his nose and squinted at the hay bale . " Nice shooting , but you did n't harness the power of the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You got frustrated and pulled your gun . That " he nodded toward the bullet-riddled target " was the power of your anger . " " So ? " " So your anger used you , instead of the other way around . " Sometimes he sounded more like a psychologist than a shaman . Having once worked as a psychologist myself this annoyed me , perhaps proving the point that doctors make the worst patients . " Who cares ? I nailed the target , did n't I ? " The heat was getting to me . As if reading my mind , Sequoia pulled a flask from a large pocket in his cargo pants , unscrewed the cap , and offered me a drink of water . Even lukewarm , it tasted sweet and wonderful . I controlled my urge to guzzle the whole thing and handed the flask back . Sequoia took a sip and screwed the cap back on , a thoughtful look on his face . " When you act out of anger you might win the battle , but you 're gon na lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's the kind of power that does n't last . " " But my anger got the job done , " I argued . " I hit the damn target . " He walked toward the hay bale , collecting stray arrows along the way . " What are you mad about ? " he called over his shoulder . " Let 's deal with that first . " I went with the easy answer . " Tom 's death . " It had been just a few months since my fiance had been killed in an investigation gone bad . The emotional fallout lingered , and probably would for sometime . " Besides that , " Sequoia said . I tuned into myself . First thing I noticed was the aforementioned heat . On an October day when much of the country would be putting logs on the fire , southern California was baking . It was only nine in the morning and the temperature was climbing toward ninety . Plus , the wind was making me miserable . Blowing down from the high desert , the scorching Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ran my tongue over my lower lip , which had become a ridge of flaky skin . It felt like a wound . " What 's really bugging me is this weather , " I called , raising my voice to be heard over the wind . " This Santa Ana makes me nervous , like something bad 's going to happen . " Sequoia returned to my side , the fistful of feathered arrows a bouquet in his hand . " Sounds like a premonition . Maybe you 're afraid of what you know is going to happen , and your anger is covering up your fear . " A crow cawed in the distance . As I turned toward the sound , the Santa Ana blew another shank of hair across my face . The ends slapped my cheek so hard it stung . " No , " I said irritably , " it 's just this damn wind . It 's getting to me . Make it stop . " I brushed the flyaway strands out of my eyes and bent at the waist , gathering my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knot at the top of my head and stood upright . Sequoia had turned away from me and was facing east , into the wind . He 'd once told me that if I ever had a problem I had no answer for , I could face east and the answer would come to me . I looked at his stoic profile and wondered if he was seeking an answer now . At that moment the wind simply died . It had been blowing hard , but suddenly it was gone , as if someone had pulled the plug on a giant fan beyond the foothills . A hush came over the land and I found myself standing in complete stillness . After a morning of nonstop gusting , the change was as dramatic as a full eclipse . At first I figured it was a temporary ebb , but the calm stretched for over a minute . " Sequoia ? " He stood silently , still facing east , where the sun had risen halfway into the sky . I tried to read his face , but could n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a sense he was communing with someoneor something I could n't see . Without the cooling effect of the wind , the heat from the blazing sun intensified . Despite the broil , I felt goose bumps rising along my neck . " Sequoia , did you make the wind stop ? " He did n't move . My question sat on the breezeless air , unanswered . Even the crows were quiet . A high-pitched electronic beeping erupted from the pager clipped to my waistband , killing the moment . Sequoia turned to me and nodded toward the pager on my hip . " Better answer that one . " I pushed the button and glanced at the display . I did n't recognize the phone number but did recognize the three digits tacked on the end911 . Whoever was paging considered it an emergency . I reached for the backpack that served as my combination purse , briefcase , and tool chest . I searched and came up empty . " Shit . I think I left my cell phone in the car . " " You can use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cargo pants and handed over a phone . I dialed the number on my pager display and waited . After the first ring a somber male voice answered . " Loebman . " " Hi . This is Elizabeth Chase , responding to your page . " " You the psychic PI ? " " That 's correct . " A breeze had begun to riffle through the cheatgrass again . I got a funny feeling in my gutwhether it was from the wind or something else , I was n't sure . " Thanks for calling back . You know Detective McKenna ? " The name was fresh in my mind . McKenna worked SDPD homicide . We 'd met on a case I 'd worked recently and had stayed in casual touch . " Yeah , I know Karl . " " He 's the one who gave me your number . Said you were the real McCoy . " " And you are ? " " Ohsorry . Bruce Loebman . I 'm an area detective with the San Diego Sheriff , working the Fielding case . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed . " Sorry , I 'm not familiar with that one . " " The telecommunications mogul out in Rancho Santa Fe ? His son 's been missing for five days . It 's all over TV . Crime Stoppers has been running public-service announcements on it every night . Surprised you have n't seen them . " Now I put it together . Frank Fielding was the CEO of a wireless communications firm headquartered in north San Diego County . In the past few years the company 's stock had rocketed in value . Fielding became a multimillionaire and moved to Rancho Santa Fe , the community my parents had settled into long before the place became synonymous with obscene wealth . I remembered seeing the story about the kidnapping on the news and thinking that a family like the Fieldings was the perfect target . There was no need to ask how Loebman 's case was going . If he had any solid leads , he would n't be calling me . I heard a sigh on the end of the line . " Anyway , Karl said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , uh , I 'd like to do that . " The hesitancy in his voice told me he was n't sure about working with a psychic . I could have reassured him with my credentialsmy double Ph.D . from Stanford , my state-certified PI license , my VIP commendationsbut I hate self-promotion . " Sure , " I said . " Missing persons cases are my strong suit . " " Great . " Hope was edging out his skepticism . " What do you pick up about the Fielding boy ? " I smiled to myself and forgave Loebman 's naivete . " I do n't know what McKenna told you , but this does n't exactly work like a psychic hot line . I 'll need to meet with you first and get briefed on the case . If I take it on , my standard retainer is five hundred dollars , plus expenses . " " Oh . " Loebman took a minute to let that sink in . " Okay , that 's doable . I 'm at the Fielding place now . You got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not available right this minute . I 'm way out in " Sequoia 's hand on my arm stopped me short . " Just a minute . " I turned and looked into a face so solemn it took me aback . " Go now , " Sequoia said .
