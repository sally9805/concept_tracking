<p> Perhaps the success of the 2003 Florida Marlins has helped bring the stolen base back to baseball . <p> Entering Friday , Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Dave Roberts was 12-for-12 in stolen bases , Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Scott Podsednik was 11-for-11 and St. Louis Cardinals infielder Tony Womack was 7-for-7 . That 's a combined 30-for-30 for the National League 's top three stolen-base leaders . <p> Roberts and Podsednik were on pace to surpass 100 steals , a milestone that has n't been reached since Vince Coleman swiped 109 in 1987 . <p> ' Obviously , this is the day and age of the home run , ' Roberts said . ' But it 's still easier to drive in a run with a base hit than it is to hit a home run , so any time you can get in scoring position , it 's a positive . ' <p> Meanwhile , Juan Pierre has started to run again . The Marlins ' leadoff hitter and defending stolen base champion did n't get his first steal until his 12th game , but then went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange , but Pierre 's steal sprints were slowed by a dislocated pinky finger he suffered late in spring training . Other than when he 's trying to break up a double play , Pierre never has been able to slide with his feet first . And it was n't until a few days ago that his injured finger was cleared for the pounding of the head-first slide . <p> A-Rod foundering in Big Apple <p> It was late in spring training and New York Yankees general manager Brian Cashman was asked if there were any concerns , besides injuries , as his $ 184 million team was getting ready to start the season . <p> With astute foresight , Cashman focused on the Nos. 4 and 5 rotation spots . <p> ' And then how our new guys will play in New York , ' he said . ' Some people do n't react as well to it as they do in other cities . ' <p> Among the stars the Yankees added in the offseason were Kevin Brown , Javier Vazquez , Alex Rodriguez , Gary Sheffield and Kenny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much fear of A-Rod not relishing baseball 's greatest stage ? <p> ' You have the fear of everybody until you see them do it , ' Cashman said . ' But you still have to take your chances and make your move . ' <p> To date , Rodriguez has been maligned with a serious bout of stage fright . He was dreadful during the hyped , four-game series against the rival Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park last weekend , getting nothing more than a harmless single in 17 at-bats . In the field , Rodriguez 's nerves showed on one costly play when he double-clutched before making an errant throw into center field . <p> Through 16 games , Rodriguez was batting .209 with four RBIs while hitting in the No. 3 hole of what was supposed to be baseball 's most vaunted lineup since the 1927 Yankees . <p> It 's not that Rodriguez ca n't play in a pressure-packed environment . In 2000 , he led the Seattle Mariners to the American League Championship Series where he batted .409 with two homers in a six-game series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having little to play for but personal statistics the past three seasons with the lowly Texas Rangers , Rodriguez needs time adjusting to a win-or-else atmosphere . <p> It took Roger Clemens a year to get comfortable in pinstripes . Clemens won back- <p> to-back Cy Young Awards while pitching for the also-ran Toronto Blue Jays in 1997-98 , then went a mediocre 14-10 with a 4.60 ERA in his first season with the Yankees in 1999 . It was n't until the postseason of 2000 that Clemens reached the level of Yankee excellence . <p> The expectation here is Rodriguez will hit fewer than 40 homers for the first time in seven years , but then revive conversation as the game 's best player next season . <p> A new lease on expansion <p> Remember the Doug Danforth-led expansion committee that picked Denver and Miami to become the newest members of Major League Baseball in 1991 ? Back then , all baseball cared about was how much money prospective owners had in their bank accounts . Miami received a MLB franchise solely because Wayne Huizenga was wealthier than any prospective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Denver was the second choice because its then-limited partnership group of Coors Brewing , Oren Benton , Jerry McMorris and Charlie Monfort promised more money than the third choice , Tampa-St . Petersburg . Baseball is doing it differently this time as it tries to relocate the Montreal Expos , probably to either Washington , D.C. , or Las Vegas , in time for the 2005 season . Commissioner Bud Selig knows Huizenga failed as owner of the Marlins while the Rockies flourished in their early years despite an ownership group so shaky it nearly collapsed before playing its first game . <p> Why were the Rockies so superior to the Marlins on the balance sheets , if not the standings ? The Rockies were one of the first professional sports franchises to get taxpayers to fund their baseball-only stadium while collecting virtually 100 percent of the stadium-generated revenues . The Marlins , meanwhile , continue paying rent for the right to play at the home of the NFL Miami Dolphins . <p> This time , baseball has been bargaining more with the Federico Peas than Wayne Huizengas of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure-all , baseball hopes to assure long-term viability by asking prospective city officials to pay for a venue and surrender the profits . Such a sweetheart arrangement would help enhance the franchise 's value , which in turn should entice competitive bids from prospective ownership groups . Baseball will announce the new city for the Expos , probably at the all-star break , but that will only begin the process of selecting the team 's new owner . <p> At the moment , a shrewd billionaire may not pay a $ 300,000 minimum salary for the mess that is the Expos ' franchise . But given a fresh start in a new city , a new stadium and a favorable lease , baseball 's asking price for the Expos is expected to be set at $ 300 million . <p> Although a Washington , D.C. , group recently announced plans to totally fund a new ballpark , MLB officials remain skeptical because they have yet to see the proposal . <p> Footnotes <p> It 's easy to understand why Barry Bonds is leading the majors with 20 walks going into Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bellhorn , who was batting .167 with one homer , entered the weekend leading the American League with 17 RBIs ? a <p> This is stupid . Major-league officials are including the two Tokyo games that drew sellout crowds of 55,000 each in Tampa Bay 's overall attendance . This explains why the Devil Rays rank 20th in attendance with an average crowd of 25,839 . Remove Tokyo from the equation and Tampa Bay would rank 28th at 18,548. a <p> Reports this winter that Andy Pettitte turned down more money from the Yankees to sign a three-year , $ 31.5 million deal with the Houston Astros were not entirely accurate . The guaranteed portion of the Yankees ' offer was for two years and $ 26 million . A third year and another $ 13 million was dependent on Pettitte avoiding multiple trips to the disabled list . There was a red flag in the Yankees ' proposal : Pettitte was unable to start as hoped this weekend at Coors Field because of a strained elbow sustained in his season debut .  --  <p> WHAT YOU MIGHT <p> HAVE MISSED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1999 , Jim Wolf , brother of Phillies starting pitcher Randy Wolf , was hired full time this year . <p> What it means : The only restriction on Jim Wolf is he can not work behind the plate in a game in which his brother is pitching . But to completely arrest the perceived conflict , Jim Wolf should not be allowed to work Phillies games , period . Integrity is about all the umpires have and , fair or not , there would be a perception this virtue would be compromised if Wolf ever had to rule on a close play at first base in a Phillies game . <p> WHAT TO WATCH <p> Cubs and the Cards <p> When : Friday , Saturday and Sunday <p> Where : Busch Stadium , St. Louis <p> Why : This is baseball 's third-best rivalry , behind the Yankees-Red Sox and Giants-Dodgers . The allegiance line with the Cubs and Cards is drawn at Springfield , Ill. , otherwise known as the home of Abraham Lincoln . The series became heated last year and both teams are offensive juggernauts this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League in hitting ( .299 ) , runs ( 6.9 per game ) and home runs ( 34 ) while the Cubs were second in hitting ( .297 ) , runs ( 6.5 ) and home runs ( 30 ) . The Cubs are likely to start Greg Maddux , Matt Clement and Carlos Zambrano against Woody Williams , Jeff Suppan and Matt Morris .
