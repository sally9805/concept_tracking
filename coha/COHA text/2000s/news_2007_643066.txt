<p> This picture-postcard city of shimmering lagoons is plastered with red-and-green posters that read " Think With the Senses  --  Feel with the Mind . Art in the Present Tense , " the theme of the 52nd Venice Biennale . Since Wednesday collectors and curators , artists and dealers have flocked here to look at and to gauge the state of new art . <p> But amid the glamorous parties and the people watching ( Elton John and the actress Kim Cattrall were among the celebrity sightings ) are chilling images of an apocalyptic world . <p> The works on view at the national pavilions in the Giardini , the shaded gardens that have been home to the Biennale for more than 110 years , and at the Arsenale , the former shipyards and warehouses where Venetian fleets were once built , pose many questions but provide few answers . The Tokyo-born artist Hiroharu Mori , for example , presented visitors with " A Camouflaged Question in the Air , " a giant white balloon with a big question mark in a camouflage pattern in the center . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , but this year reminders of death and war and forces beyond our control are everywhere . " There is a sense of fragility , and war is only one of the destructive forces , " said Robert Storr , the curator of the Biennale 's central exhibition . A former curator at the Museum of Modern Art who is currently the dean of the Yale Art School , Mr. Storr is the first American to organize this event . <p> " I was n't trying to deliver a message , but like Bruce Nauman , I wanted to say , ' Please Pay Attention Please , ' " he said , referring to Mr. Nauman 's writings of that title . <p> It was hard not to pay attention . The paintings , installations and videos in the exhibition organized by Mr. Storr in the Italian Pavilion variously deal with the sublime , the spiritual , the terrifying and the unknown . Some of the works seem quite innocent , like a video of a giant hand arranging a doll 's house , by a Japanese artist known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into place , a giant squid bubbles out of a caldron , destroying the idyllic scene . <p> New silk-screen paintings by the American artist Jenny Holzer , best known for her neon signs of social commentary , are based on classified military documents and the Guantanamo Bay detainment center , including a medical examiner 's autopsy report for an Iraqi national . He had suffered " fractures of the ribs and a contusion of the left lung " suggesting " significant blunt force injuries of the thorax , " the report says . <p> But at the core of the show are more enigmatic works by older contemporary masters like Ellsworth Kelly , Robert Ryman and Sigmar Polke . Mr. Polke 's skylit room of magical paintings  --  dark abstract , translucent canvases  --  had viewers returning at different times of day to witness how they changed as the weather did , from bright sunlight to rain . <p> As is true at every Biennale , art and commerce are inextricably intertwined . Francois Pinault , the luxury goods magnate who owns the Palazzo Grassi and recently won a bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ della Dogana , into a contemporary art space , edged out a score of museums who competed to buy the entire room of Mr. Polke 's paintings . He is planning to show the seven works  --  a triptych and six individual paintings  --  in a special room in the Dogana that the Japanese architect Tadao Ando and Mr. Polke are to design together . <p> " The artist wanted them to remain in the city where they were conceived , " said Philippe Segalot , the Manhattan dealer who brokered the transaction . <p> Near Mr. Polke 's paintings in the Italian Pavilion is a show-stopping installation by the French artist Sophie Calle . In one of two stark rooms viewers are presented with a wall text explaining that Ms. Calle learned her mother had a month left to live the same day she received a call inviting her to exhibit at the Biennale . In the next room is a video of her mother resting peacefully in her final hours with medical attendants hovering over her ; her favorite music , Mozart 's Clarinet Concerto , plays in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms. Calle also represents France in its national pavilion . Again she transformed the space into an autobiographical installation , here of paintings and videos , asking 107 women to interpret a breakup letter from a man she had been involved with . Actresses acted the letter , a singer sang it , a criminologist analyzed it , an editor annotated it , a photographer shot it , and a crossword puzzle specialist created a crossword puzzle of it . There was even a parrot who ate the letter . <p> Elsewhere the theme of loss is less personal . In the Nordic Pavilion the Baghdad-born artist Adel Abidin , who lives in Finland , presents his black-humored " Abidin Travels  --  Welcome to Baghdad , " a spoof travel agency complete with leaflets and interactive computer screens on which visitors witness the horrors of Baghdad , win " fantastic prizes , " rent " cars " ( tanks and Humvees ) and take out insurance ( $150,000 a day ) . His slogan : " Much more than a holiday . " <p> In the Canadian Pavilion David Altmejd has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 300 stuffed birds ( some purchased on eBay ) , mushrooms , giant resin werewolves and male mannequins with bird 's heads . <p> Normally the installation at the Arsenale has a hodepodge effect , but under Mr. Storr , it is more coherent , looking like a carefully conceived museum exhibition rather than a random assemblage of works . Among the standouts are a pair of tapestrylike hangings fashioned from discarded soda cans by the artist El Anatsui , who was born in Ghana and lives in Nigeria ; though steeped in African culture , their shimmering patina evoked the luster of a painting by Gustav Klimt . <p> For the first time the Biennale is also including comics . The North African artists Eyoum Ngangue and Faustin Titi have created original drawings for a comic book about displacement , depicting a young African boy 's failed crossing from Tangiers to Europe in search of a brighter future . <p> Many Biennale visitors have been struck by a powerful wall of pencil portraits by the American artist Emily Prince based on photographs of American soldiers who died in Iraq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relying on photographs posted at a military Web site by family members . Nearby is a video by the Italian artist Paolo Canevari that shows a teenage boy kicking around a skull as though it were a football in a bombed-out former Serbian Army headquarters in Belgrade . <p> Among the countries represented for the first time , those grouped in the African Pavilion at the far end of the Arsenale have been among the most talked about . Titled " Check List-Luanda Pop , " the sprawling exhibition , which seems to explore what it means to be African , is filled with everything from paintings by Andy Warhol , Jean-Michel Basquiat and Marlene Dumas to works by little-known African artists . <p> The works are from the collection of Sindika Dokolo , a Congolese businessman . The exhibition was chosen by a jury from among several alternatives , and some who were not selected objected that one person 's collection could not be representative of African culture . They also contend that it was selected partly because Mr. Dokolo was able to pay for the exhibition , estimated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curator of the exhibition , said it was " difficult to represent an entire continent " and called the accusations " cynical . " <p> With each Biennale , more and more art can be found in unexpected places . Nestled in a 14th-century palazzo near the Fenice theater , is a Zen-like installation by the Korean-born artist Lee Ufan , 71 , founder of the Mono Ha , a movement that emerged in Tokyo in the late 1960s and is translated as " School of Things . " He has created a sequence of pristine rooms with natural rocks juxtaposed with rectangular or steel plates , some of them gracefully bent . There are also rooms of white canvases and screens decorated with single gray single brush strokes in varying gradations . <p> It is the first time this artist has exhibited in Venice . Asked the inevitable question of how his work relates to American Minimalism , he said his installation was rooted in what he called the art of yohaku , or the resonance of emptiness . <p> " American minimalism is just ' It is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not .
