When I married Jay I was sure he 'd never leave me . I was certain that he loved me more and that he loved the life we 'd made together . If anyone was going to do the leaving it was going to be me . I 'm convinced I thought about it more than he did  --  looking at my softening face in the mirror as I sat in the beauty salon ; sitting in the car wash tempted to open the window and let in that nasty soapy water inside the white Range Rover he 'd insisted on buying ; strolling down the aisle of Grant 's mindlessly putting butter , eggs , cereal , and ground turkey in the cart . I 'd imagine myself going home , setting the groceries on the kitchen floor and leaving . The idea rolled around my head like a pebble in my shoe . Too big to ignore , but eventually I did and the feeling went away , or I should tell you I made it go away . I deaden those feelings with my will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The pill also rid me of those knavish thoughts that took up residence in my mind for as long as I can remember . The pill let me let go . Jay had wanted , and he literally said this , a real family that would look good in the Christmas card . Why had n't I just packed up when he said that ? He had actually considered the vision of red plaid-donned children on a damn Christmas card important . Jay was a good father , but I was the one in charge of the reality of three kids  --  the daily doling out of hugs , support , information , monitoring homework , scheduling doctor appointments , play dates , lessons , teacher conferences and on and on and on . But now he has left me and I hate feeling like a damn cliche , but I am , we are . He left me , I'dlater learned , for a younger , thinner , better-credentialed woman who he 'd met at a traffic light . I 'd become the aging suburban housewife who wore jeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demands of a carpool . But I was n't frumpy or unattractive , although like most I 'd gained an extra few pounds with each kid , which now amounted to ten to fifteen that I could stand to lose . I dressed the way that was appropriate for the kind of life I lived  --  shuttling kids , taking care of a baby and a house and cooking and organizing all of our lives . That 's what I did . I did n't start out wanting the kind of life we ended up having . I had wanted to own my life , but that concept was amorphous , and then I got hurt and scared and there was Jay who knew exactly what he wanted and said he wanted me to be with him , so I figured why not . I knew he knew what he wanted to do and maybe along the way I 'd figure out how to live the life I wanted . My instinct had told me that I needed to marry myself first , cleave to a clearly defined self first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome enough , good enough in bed , my friends liked him enough and I remember thinking , during the rehearsal dinner , This is enough . There was some wow to have found this person who is right for me , even if I did n't quite know what that was . He 's good enough . I did n't listen to myself back then  --  I was twenty-six and self-knowledge was still more than a decade away . What I did know about myself scared me . I knew I did n't want to be like the women who came before me  --  my mother and grandmother and aunts  --  wild , untamable women who at one time were fierce and lively but seemed to practice a kind of antilove . They were vivid , hard and often joyless . They scared the shit out of me . What I convinced myself of was that I wanted to be sedate and reserved , which I 'd decided was normal , and to let someone else worry about personhood . Jay 's work , or I should say success , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to volunteer on the PTA , work out , see my friends for lunch and shop . I shopped when I was happy and when I was not . I shopped for me , for my kids , their friends , the house , my friends ' houses . I had been happy enough . Happier than I 'd been in my own birth family  --  where my mother was never home and when she was , she was only happy in our garage , which was her studio , covered in paint and working on a canvas . She had had a passion that did n't have anything to do with my father or me . She was frustrated by a lack of creative opportunity and had never settled in her work as a high school art teacher , but still labored in that garage long after she stopped showing or being represented . She had artist and writer and musician friends who we did n't know well , who she seemed to need to breathe . She 'd leave for days at a time , leaving Daddy in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Girl Scout projects , all the things mothers and daughters were suppose to do . Daddy loved my mother with a childlike devotion . He used to say he had three things in his life that mattered : running  --  he 'd been a sprinter in college who became a high school gym teacher , my mother and me . I believed the running was a distant second to Mother and I came in , maybe , third . It did n't really matter , though , because I wanted my mother to help me with my homework and my Girl Scout projects and to do my hair . When I was pregnant with Malcolm , it was my dad who called up some friends and hosted a shower for me . When I had Malcolm I thanked God that I 'd had a boy and would n't have to deal with a daughter who 'd force me to deal with all the anger and lack I 'd had with my own mother . Then I had another boy and I took that as a sign of God 's grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect dinner parties and me having too much wine , which was the only way I got through them , Jay and I came home , fell into bed without my diaphragm . We made Ivy and I seriously considered getting rid of it . If RU486 had been available I 'm sure I would have . Then I found out that it was a girl and spent the rest of my pregnancy petrified , although some part of me knew I needed to deal with my mother issues . I named her Ivy because it is strong , constantly growing and resilient , my hope for her . Ivy was five months old , I was feeding her rice cereal mixed with breast milk when Jay said he was leaving me . Cereal was on her fingers and face and in both of our hair . She was in her high chair laughing and I felt unrestrained happiness only a baby 's laughter can provide . Even with breast milk running down my T-shirt and onto my overalls , and cereal on the red bandanna that was supposed to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , in my jeans or overalls or khakis , like I was one of those cool stay-at-home moms you see in computer ads . I did n't understand feeling unattractive , like I overheard other women at my kids ' school complain about . My body and hair were in good enough shape and my makeup was in some evidence . I had to keep reminding myself that I would be forty on my next birthday . Of course , I did n't look like the women , I should say girls , in fashion magazines , or the ones who Jay worked with , those real estate women who drove Mercedes wagons , wore gold Rolexes with diamonds , got their hair blown out twice a week and were acquainted with Botox . But I did n't want to look like maintaining my looks was my job . Jay walks in , through the back door that was always unlocked . It was too early for him to be home for lunch , but not unusual for him to drop by the house during the day if he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'd set up an office in Harlem , and in this hot market his workload had doubled . He checked the mail , which sat as it always did in a basket on the granite kitchen counter , grunted something about his shirts having been delivered , went and got them from the hall closet and then , as if he 'd asked " what 's for dinner ? " said , " I 'm leaving you . " Just like that . No " we 've got to talk " or " I 've been thinking " or even " you know I 'm not really happy . " Nothing . Just I 'm leaving you . I sat there for a moment , still feeding Ivy , thinking , I think he just said I 'm leaving you , but telling myself , No , you 're wrong , he could n't have said that , what are you , crazy ? He ca n't leave you ; you have kids , three kids , a mortgage , an SUV and a station wagon and a swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to one of the two sections of the peach-colored plastic bowl and turned around to look at Jay 's face . It was clinched and stern and I could n't tell whether he was trying to hold back tears or if he was furious and trying not to show it . " What did you say ? " He looked down and started babbling about life being a one-shot deal and having to make the most of it and being back in the city ... and ... lonely ... and then my ears stopped working and I thought , well , I 'll stand up  --  maybe if he sees me , he 'll snap out of this lunacy . He 'll see me and Ivy and he 'll snap out of it . " Jay , Jay , Jay . Wait . What ? What 're you trying to say ? What 's this ? What are you talking about ? " I touched his forearm and he stepped away from me . He rubbed his eye with one hand , exhaled in what seemed to be frustration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't been for a long time and it 's just , I think better , it 'll be better like this . I ca n't , I just ca n't keep this going . " " Keep what going ? " He blew out again , this time seeming less certain of his position . " This , " he said and looked up , his hands up , waving toward the ceiling . " All this . I just do n't want this anymore . " " Okay , so all what ? What 's wrong ? " He practically whispered , " I do n't know you anymore . " He looked at me and quickly looked away . " You 're not who I married . " He opened the door and walked out . Just like that , just like he had every morning for the past thirteen years . He just walked out . Now Ivy was chanting " Da-Da ... Da-Da ... Da-Da . " The only word she says . They all say it first , Mama , Mommy comes way later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression , I guess , takes more time to master . Once they do , of course , you wish they did n't because they must say it six-hundred times a day . My head felt like someone was standing on it . I wanted to go upstairs and get into my big , feathered bed , feel the smooth 380-thread count sheets against my body , the goose down on top of me and under my head . I needed a nap ; I needed to sleep like Aurora , only longer , like Rip Van Winkle . I need to sleep so long that when I wake up all the pain , all the explaining , the messes , the fights , the bouts of self-loathing that will come , would be over . I called my neighbor Paige to watch Ivy and maybe even the boys when they got home from school . She had four kids , her three younger ones around the same ages as mine . She had an au pair and a live-in housekeeper . It was never a problem having three more kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of her high chair , wiped cereal from her hair , face and hands with a wet paper towel , put her socks back on , pulled on a knit hat and sweater and carried her next door . My neighbor was in her kitchen watching the Food Network on her wide-screen TV that was built into a wall ; she was cooking along with the TV and talking on the phone . She waved a wooden spoon at me and Ingracia appeared , as if summoned by spoon , and took Ivy from my arms . " Gracias , " I said to her and smiled . She smiled back and immediately began removing Ivy 's hat and sweater while cooing to her . My neighbor got off the phone and said , in her usual sarcastic way , " You look great ! Big party tonight ? " I just breathed in and out deeply and thanked her for rescuing me , again . " I 'm exhausted . I 've got ta lay down . " " Go , get some rest . You know we love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after school ? " " Malcolm and Marcus 'll be home around five , after soccer practice ... " " Fine , I 'll look out for them . They like meatloaf ? That 's what the kids are having . " " Yeah , that 'll be fine . I need to lie down . My head is ... " " Go , go , and rest . If you do n't feel any better later , they can just sleep over . We love having them , do n't even think about it , go ... " My look hugged her and I hoped she could feel how totally , truly grateful I was . " The back door 'll be opened if they wan na come home , " I said wearily as I left . I let the screen door close behind me , scribbled on a Post-it and stuck it to the door , instructing the boys to go next door for dinner . I breathed in the silence of my house . I could n't recall the last time it had been this quiet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I used to love to be alone with my thoughts , daydreaming for hours as a child and then sharing some of it with my cousin Zackie , who would remain my confidant into adulthood , who 'd listen to my dreams with his eyes closed , as if visualizing pictures of what I said . It was fall and chillier inside than it was out . We had n't turned the heat up yet . I went to the thermostat  --  it was at fifty-six degrees . I moved it to sixty-nine and looked around my family room . Every detail of this house I 'd put my soul into making sure was just right . The khaki duck fabric on the sectional for family viewing of our large-screen TV , for which I had an armoire built ; the perfect coral-colored chenille throw over Jay 's brown leather arm chair ; the ficus I 'd nurtured since it was a baby bush . Our black-and-white family photos in gallery frames , shot and framed and hung by me just so , chronicling all the children through gummy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women who complained about getting lost in taking care of everyone but themselves , but I did n't feel that way . It was the common lament of the women who made up the mommy 's group I 'd been in when we lived in Brooklyn , when Malcolm was a baby . All the women were powerful used-to-bes : a banker , several lawyers , a journalist , but I 'd never really had a career to miss . My photographer 's assistant days had been short-lived . Of course , I would come to see I did give up something , but that 'd come later . Was n't my book club , my volunteer work , shopping , something ? I had things to do ; I had a life , did n't I ?
