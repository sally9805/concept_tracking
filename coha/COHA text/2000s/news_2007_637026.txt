<p> Henry County did n't survive its region tournament in good enough condition to reach the state tournament last season , when it was in Class AAAA . The Warhawks are hoping a change of scenery will work wonders in Class AAA . <p> They got off to a good start in their Region 4-AAA tournament , routing Ola 68-46 as Destin Kelley led the way with 21 points . The Warhawks will play Perry in the next round Wednesday at 4 p.m. at Spalding . <p> Pike 's strikes <p> Walker 's Taylor Pike seemed like a one-man wrecking crew Monday in a Region 6-AA tournament game against Avondale . <p> Pike scored 35 points , leading the Wolverines to a 78-46 rout of the Blue Devils and into the next round of the tournament , where they will square off against Decatur on Wednesday at 4 p.m. at Holy Innocents ' . <p> The game 's next two high scorers had 12 apiece  --  Walker 's Matt Skesavage and Avondale 's Lee Jackson . <p> Single-digit period <p> For one quarter it looked like the scoreboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total of nine points were scored in the first quarter of Grayson 's Region 8-AAAAA tournament game against Brookwood . <p> But , led by Quanterus Smith 's game-high 14 points , Grayson picked up the pace and earned a 48-37 victory that propels the Rams into the next round against Shiloh . <p> No. 3 skates by ... <p> Southside is Class AAA 's No. 3-ranked team , but it faced the possibility of missing the state tournament when it tipped off Monday in the Region 5-AAA tournament against North Atlanta . <p> Southside avoided the upset with C.J. Davis ' 16 points leading the way to a 54-49 victory . That gives the Lasers , the tournament hosts , the right to play Chamblee on Thursday . A victory in that game would ensure the Lasers of a berth in the state tournament . <p> ... while No. 9 rolls <p> Wesleyan had little problem locking up its 20th victory of the season in the Region 6-AA tournament . <p> The Wolves did n't need any one dominant performance to complete a 56-30 rout of Creekview , playing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led the way with 10 points for the winners , who will meet Pace Academy on Wednesday at 7 p.m. at Holy Innocents ' . <p> On the fringe <p> Blessed Trinity is n't one of the top 10 teams in Class AAA  --  at least not yet . The Titans are among the " others receiving votes " in the rankings . <p> But the Titans looked like a team trying to make their case for advancement  --  at least in the Region 5-AAA tournament . Led by Tyler Cerone 's 21 points , Blessed Trinity romped to its 21st win in 26 tries , an 82-52 pummeling of Therrell . The Titans will move on to a Thursday game against either Riverwood or South Atlanta . <p> They have a shot <p> Commerce will take on a state-tournament team in Region 8-A ( Athens Academy ) today after defeating Athens Christian 44-35 . <p> SCORES , SCHEDULES <p> BOYS <p> REGION 2-AAAAA <p> Newton vs .
