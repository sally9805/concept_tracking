A girth for pack or saddle ; a tight grip ; a thing done with ease ; a certainty to happen . <p> - Webster 's for cinch <p> Two years had slipped by since Cinch moved into the interior to be closer to the projects where he did most of his work , but mostly Cinch was here because this was where he wanted to be . While cracking two eggs into the pan over a low propane flame , he counted the number of deliveries he was scheduled to make this morning , five or six . Would there be enough amoxicillin much needed by the children this time of year , with or without bubblegum flavoring ? He scrunched his eyes , and wondered if such foreign invasion of their immune system was fair trade for the destruction of their traditional diet . Would he be back in time for the meeting with the Minister of Natural Resources and Environment ? <p> It had taken him five months of continuous effort to set her up for this meeting . He never had any doubt about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about acquiring a religion for once , just to help it along . But he did n't , and chose instead to focus his energies on getting something done rather than debating over things he could not prove . <p> He spooned the scrambled eggs onto a porcelain plate and ate standing up . What he could prove was that it could be done . After all , he was used to seeing the seemingly impossible reverse itself in his own country , a country of flimflams and cons in which people willingly believed that dropping a uranium-235 bomb and a plutonium-239 bomb on civilians that indiscriminately killed two hundred and eighty thousand people instantly half a century ago actually saved lives . For emphasis , he scraped a thumbnail across the copper rivets of his porcelain plate . So , in a series of increasingly detailed and provocative letters and e-mails to the Natural Resources and Environment Minister , he added to his daily diet of four hundred lies , on the average . And why not ? <p> Cinch 's first letter politely requested a meeting at the Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a mutual interest in the continued welfare of the some three hundred square miles of natural preserve owned by the government-two hundred thousand acres or roughly half the size of the county in Oregon that Cinch grew up in-they meet to discuss developing some plans for maintaining its ecological integrity . Each subsequent letter and e-mail prompted more discussion items : reforestation and erosion control ; protection for the flora and fauna , and , of course , including the frogs and cicadas ; water conservation and safeguards for water quality ; the e-mails in the last month attaching as documents a copy of his graduate degree in forestry , and experience testimonials for fire management and recreation work with the U.S. Forest Service ; and the final letter exploring a mutually beneficial program proffering the eleven small villages that ring the lower elevations of this park as a buffer zone against commercial development . Whew ! Take that , kiddo . All but where to put the crapper . How could she refuse ? <p> Quatar knocked and came into the kitchen , pouring himself a cup of cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Dark-skinned with deep , dark brown eyes suggesting impatience , it was Quatar 's final touch in getting a sympathetic friend at the embassy to invite the Minister to a cultural exchange reception two weeks ago where they met at last face-to-face and agreed to this afternoon 's meeting . He had also helped Cinch with many of the items on the shopping list sent to M.N.R.E. After all , he had grown up in one of these eleven villages before he went to the city for an education hundreds of miles away on the coast . Now he was back years later , for just about the same reasons that Cinch was here from thousands of miles away . <p> " Hey , yeah . How many- " Cinch started to ask . <p> Quatar held up the extended fingers of his right hand , a throwback to their early days of working together for a relief organization and fumbling with the language . Cinch knew that Quatar 's eyes saw and remembered everything , everything , and suspected that if his friend would one day turn to writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is closed today . They took someone to the city 's hospital last night-not bad , a field cut . The barefoot nurse did her job . We have enough amoxi for this morning . " <p> The meeting took place at a former sweatshop the local municipal government in partnership with a civilian action team and the foreign assistance program that Cinch and Quatar worked for took over a couple of years ago . This building had been abandoned two years ago by the garment-manufacturing owners when its workers , women all , unionized and submitted a list of demands to the management . Now , in stepped the Minister of Natural Resources and Environment . Cinch saw her as a quick blonde with double-lined lips , someone misplaced in time and location , or worse . Followed by several aides , she sat uncomfortably on a bench in the former factory that now served as a training center for the villages ' barefoot nurses who sometimes also took charge of their domestic violence and children 's health care programs . <p> " You like my rings , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands with a ring on every finger , including the thumbs . " Each one is a stone from a different province of the country , " she explained . <p> It dawned on Cinch that while he had some answers , the Minister did not know what the questions were . He looked over at Quatar , who seemed to be fighting sleep or shutting his eyes in impatience . Shrugging his shoulders , he was no help . <p> " Thank you for coming here , " Cinch started saying , first making sure that everyone had a seat and a cold soft drink in front of them . Having heard about the government 's emphasis on its need for transparency , he said , " To be quick , I 'm proposing that you transfer the maintenance of this natural preserve to our organization . " <p> Silence , followed by more silence . The Minister was not looking at him . <p> She sipped on her straw , then said , " You do not have the resources to do it , " looking directly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " Cinch looked right back at her . <p> " I have a proposition , " he added . " We 'll turn this nature preserve into a park with interpretative center , cabins , restaurant , and trails . We 'll take care of it . " <p> " Wait , wait , wait , " interrupted a woman with a baby in the back of the hall . She had stood up and was gesturing with her free hand . " What are we supposed to say to these tourists as we walk them along the trail ? Ask them ' Are you enjoying our country today ? ' We have a shortage of everything . When will we have time to entertain the tourists ? " She then asked if anyone wondered who would clean their toilets and trim their hedges . <p> Another woman stood up , too , and said , " We do n't have a shortage of nothing . " <p> Several people laughed , including Quatar , who was avoiding Cinch 's searching look on what to say next . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been residing at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , his country 's compliant news media had served as the middle-class 's firewall against radical doubt . And why not ? The children of the Baby Boomer generation had swarmed to the schools ' communications programs , and now as journalists , reporters , columnists , anchors , even boom operators , they were on the job . Their visuals compressed time and space , past and present , and with changing images every two seconds and close-ups eliminating cause-and-effect , the viewer walked away with a dizzying montage of impressions signifying nothing in particular . Yes , yes , change the image , make it up , add more pixels , a lot easier than changing the real thing . Cinch sensed this was the turning moment at the meeting , but he was not exactly prepared for it happening so fast . <p> " Yes , that 's all very true , " he said , looking at the two women in the back of the room . Then he looked straight at Quatar . While he still had doubts if three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against encroaching airborne and underground seepage of toxic industrial waste , it was a bit late to back out now . But there was a chance , as there was a mountain range running through the middle of the preserve . " I propose that we play a ninety-minute soccer game , " he said . " Between your Ministry and these villages . The winner will take control of the park . " <p> The Minister looked up , and her assistant leaned over and whispered something to her . <p> " That 's impossible . You ca n't be serious . " <p> " Yes , I am . " <p> Cinch stood up and added , " Your Ministry does n't have any funds to do it , the World Bank and LM.E want you to privatize it , and in the meantime nothing 's being done . " <p> He believed in his convictions , and damn it , he was n't going to let the strengths of the Peace Corps , World Vision , Mercy Corps , Oxfam , Doctors Without Borders , or even Opus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wrangling control of this piece of land from the benign government . The villagers would relearn how to care for it as they 'd done for centuries , with adjustments for compass and tack , and in return be nourished by it before the Americans seized it and developed it into a destination resort in its harvest of empire . <p> " This is highly unusual , " the Minister said , looking at her assistant . " There is no protocol for this . " <p> Quatar raised a hand and held up five fingers . " A trial period . Let 's agree that if we win , we 'll have it for a five-year trial period . " <p> The Minister and her assistant looked at the half dozen villagers gathered at the edge of the hall , looking at their shoes , sizing up their chances . <p> " And what if you lose ? " she asked , smiling for the only time that afternoon . <p> Before Cinch or Quatar could say anything , the smarty-pants woman in the back yelled out , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all knew that they did n't want to lose the same thing twice . <p> So this was it , this empty schoolyard on Sunday , except for a few neighborhood kids curious about the gathering of fancy vans , pickups , and sedans from the city . The Ministry 's team of some twenty players had on new Adidas white and blue uniforms and matching shoes , accompanied by their own referee with whistle and two linesmen . Cinch knew they were not really enemy , but they sure looked like it with their intimidating warm-up drills . This was only a game , though the stakes were high , at least for us , Cinch thought . On his annual visits with his family in Oregon , Cinch had felt more space slipping in between him and that community in which he had spent the first eighteen years of his life , its excesses and self-indulgence displayed for all to see on Friday nights finding its way here on this Sunday . <p> The Minister walked over to where Cinch was stretching , her hands on her waist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't play , you 're not eligible , you 're not a villager , " she challenged . <p> " Why not ? " Cinch looked over to the two Peace Corps volunteers dressed in white and blue . " What about them ? " In fact he had met one of them before , a gal from Muncie , Indiana , who was a striker on the championship Northwestern team last year . " If they are eligible , so am I. " Cinch had always been curious about these Peace Corps volunteers . Here they were , seventy percent of them liberal arts majors . They came loaded with morality but no life skills except for doing e-mails , jogging , and soccer . " And besides , we 're one player short . " <p> " Okay , okay . " The Minister flashed her eyes . " Since this is a friendly game , you can borrow one of ours . We have enough . " <p> Cinch looked over at Quatar , who agreed with him . No way , no defector , turncoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mole , especially on loan . What would be the interest ? Who could trust his motive in error or valor ? <p> It was a slow endurance game . Except for the two Peace Corps volunteers , the first half exhausted every player , including the two goalies . The score was tied o-o after a penalty-free forty-five minutes , as no side could put together a coordinated offense of more than twenty yards or two consecutive passes , whichever was less . Both teams were stretched out on the sidelines drinking water . Cinch and Quatar looked around at their teammates . They wanted to say something encouraging , wave a flag or cheer or something , but they both knew that nothing more was needed to motivate them . <p> So the second half continued like the first , and several times both goalies left their penalty area to join the offense . Not many players were running anymore . Even when someone had the ball or was marking the person with the ball , it was all in slow motion . Most were visibly panting , hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sucking air . <p> Well close to the very last seconds of the game , a short villager with peddling cucumber legs managed to dribble the ball all by himself past the last white and blue defender , including the outof-position goalie , who had huffed his way up to midfield in an all-out last-minute suicide squeeze . The villager had the ball all to himself and was headed straight for the goal , until the only person still able to catch up with him , that Peace Corps gal from Muncie , Indiana , made an illegal sliding tackle from the rear in the penalty zone , sending both the ball and player to the side of the goal . Instantly the shrill whistle went up , a penalty-kick call with about five seconds left in the game . <p> The Minister screamed and protested the call , but there was no doubt it was to be a penalty kick . <p> Who would take it ? Who had a strong and straight kick ? <p> " I 'll take it . " It was Quatar , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twelve steps out , right ? I 'll take it . " <p> So it had come down to this . Eighty-nine minutes in which nothing much of anything happened , and now , the whistle , the red card , and a free kick that would almost always score , in this case , winning the game . Except for Quatar and the goalie , both sides had lined up behind the ball , witnesses to the one-on-one . He moved quickly toward the ball from the right , faked a hard kick that was followed by the diving goalie , and with his left heel behind him , Quatar tapped the ball into the net , a trick shot he had learned in grade school decades ago . That was it . End of game . Wild screaming and cheering . " We got it back " was repeated again and again , at least for the next five years . <p>
