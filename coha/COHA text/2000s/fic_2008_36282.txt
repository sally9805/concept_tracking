It was a crime that Amelia Willoughby was not married . <p> At least that was what her mother said . Amelia  --  or more correctly , Lady Amelia  --  was the second daughter of the Earl of Crowland , so no one could fault her bloodlines . Her appearance was more than passable , if one 's taste ran toward wholesome English roses , which , fortunately for Amelia , most of the ton 's did . <p> Her hair was a respectable shade of medium blond , her eyes a grayish sort of greenish color , and her skin clear and even , so long as she remembered to stay out of the sun . ( Freckles were not Lady Amelia 's friend . ) <p> She was also , as her mother liked to catalogue , of adequate intelligence , able to play the pianoforte and paint watercolors , and ( and here was where her mother punctuated the speech with an enthusiastic flourish ) in possession of all of her teeth . <p> Even better , the aforementioned teeth were perfectly straight , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the match of 1818 , neatly landing the Marquis of Beresford . ( But not , as frequently reported by Jacinda Lennox 's mother , before turning down two viscounts and an earl . ) <p> But all of those attributes paled next to what was certainly the most pertinent and overreaching aspect of Amelia Willoughby 's life , and that was her longstanding engagement to the Duke of Wyndham . <p> Had Amelia not been betrothed in the cradle to Thomas Cavendish ( who was at the time the Heir Apparent to the dukedom and barely out of leading strings himself ) , she certainly would not have reached the unappealing age of one-and-twenty as an unmarried maiden . <p> She had spent one season back in Lincolnshire , because no one thought she 'd need to bother with London , then she 'd spent the next in the capital , because her elder sister 's **28;1563;TOOLONG fiancT had the misfortune of contracting a fever at the age of twelve , leaving his family heirless and Elizabeth Willoughby unattached . <p> And as for the next season  --  Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Amelia was , as ever , still engaged to the duke , but they went to London anyway , because by then it would have been embarrassing to remain in the country . <p> Amelia rather liked town . She enjoyed conversation , and she very much enjoyed dancing , and , if one spoke with her mother for more than five minutes , one would have learned that had Amelia been free to marry , there would have been a half-dozen offers , at least . <p> Which meant that Jacinda Lennox would still have been Jacinda Lennox and not the Marchioness of Beresford . And more importantly , Lady Crowland and all of her daughters would still outrank the annoying little chit . <p> But then , as Amelia 's father was often heard to say  --  life was n't always fair . In fact , it rarely was . Just look at him , for the love of heaven . Five daughters . Five ! And now the earldom , which had descended neatly from father to son since there were princes in the tower , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousin in sight to lay claim upon it . <p> And , he frequently reminded his wife , it was thanks to his early maneuverings that one of his five daughters was already settled , and they need only fret about the other four , so would she please stop yammering on about the poor Duke of Wyndham and his slow progress to the altar . <p> Lord Crowland treasured peace and quiet above all else , which was something he really ought to have considered before taking the former Anthea Grantham as his bride . <p> It was n't that anyone thought that the duke would renege on his promise to Amelia and her family . On the contrary , it was well-known that the Duke of Wyndham was a man of his word , and if he said he would marry Amelia Willoughby , then as God was anyone 's witness , he would . <p> It was just that he intended to do so when it was convenient to him . Which was n't necessarily when it would be convenient to her . Or more to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , back in Lincolnshire . <p> And she was still Lady Amelia Willoughby . <p> " And I do n't mind it at all , " she declared , when Grace Eversleigh brought up the matter at the Lincolnshire Dance and Assembly . Aside from being the closest friend of Amelia 's sister Elizabeth , Grace Eversleigh was the companion to the dowager Duchess of Wyndham , and thus in far closer contact with Amelia 's affianced husband than Amelia ever had occasion to be . <p> " Oh , no , " Grace quickly assured her . " I did not mean to imply that you did . " <p> " All she said , " Elizabeth put in , giving Amelia a queer look , " was that his grace plans to remain at Belgrave for six months at least . And then you said  --  " <p> " I know what I said , " Amelia bit off , feeling her skin flush . Which was n't precisely true . She could not have repeated her speech word for word , but she had a sneaking suspicion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Well , that 's certainly lovely , but I should n't read anything into it , and in any case Elizabeth 's wedding is next month so I certainly could not dream of finalizing anything anytime soon , and regardless of what anyone says , I am in no great rush to marry him . Something something something . I barely know the man . Something something more , still Amelia Willoughby . And I do n't mind it at all . <p> Which was not the sort of speech one generally wished to relive in one 's head . <p> There was an awkward , empty moment , and then Grace cleared her throat and said , " He said he would be here this evening . " <p> " He did ? " Amelia asked , her eyes flying to Grace 's . <p> Grace nodded . " I saw him at supper . Or rather , I saw him as he walked through the room as we were taking supper . He chose not to dine with us . I think he and his grandmother are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They frequently do . " <p> <br> Continues ...
