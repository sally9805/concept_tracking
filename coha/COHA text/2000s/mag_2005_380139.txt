Customers of ATMs long ago decided they could do without a teller . Now Steven Atkinson has a bolder idea : they can also do without the cash . His company mobileATM has developed secure software that allows cell-phone owners in Britain to check their bank balances using their handsets . That may sound trivial , but 37 banks in Britain , including First Direct ( the roughly $12 billion phone and PC division of giant HSBC ) and RBS ( Royal Bank of Scotland ) , have approved it . <P> Why ? Because , says Atkinson , consumers make 150 million balance inquiries every month using 55,000 traditional hole-in-the-wall ATMs . MobileATM wants to redefine convenience . " When you ask the question ' Where is the nearest ATM ? ' I want the answer to be ' It 's in your hand , ' " says Atkinson , who was born in 1969 , the year that Chemical Bank in New York City opened the world 's first modern ATM . <P> If mobileATM is to provide a truly compelling service , should n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to walk before you can run , " says Richard Kimber , chief executive of First Direct , who notes that consumers will be able to buy top-up credit for pay-as-you-go mobile phones . He also envisions a day when British commuters might be able to purchase subway rides using their mobileATM , the next step in turning your phone into your wallet.
