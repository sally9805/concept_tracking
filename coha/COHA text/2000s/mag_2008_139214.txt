PUTTING ASIDE for the moment the question of whether or not Lance Armstrong 's return to cycling is a good or a bad thing , let us all agree that it is a very interesting thing . Witness the delicious , unscripted drama that erupted at a Las Vegas trade show last Thursday . Crashing Armstrong 's press conference at Interbike was his sworn enemy , Greg LeMond , a three-time Tour de France winner who has evolved , in middle age , into a kind of graying , Midwestern Inspector Javert . LeMond briefly hijacked the proceedings with a sometimes coherent farrago of questions designed to tie Armstrong to the doping that was so pervasive in cycling while the Texan ruled over the sport . // After indulging his uninvited guest for a minute or two , Armstrong asserted control , declaring , " It 's time for us , everybody in this room , to move on .... I appreciate you being here  --  next question . " // Here 's a question : Lance , what the hell are you thinking ? You will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 2009 Tour de France , a race you 've won seven ( consecutive ) times already . It will have been four years since you mounted a road bike in anger . The team you 're coming back with , Astana  --  directed by your old friend , Johan Bruyneel  --  has little need of you . Astana is led by Alberto Contador , a brilliant Spaniard with matchless acceleration and formidable palmars : At the tender age of 25 , he has already won all three of cycling 's grand tours . // The itch to race again " kinda snuck up " on him , Armstrong told me last week . As we know , he 'd stayed in decent postretirement shape , running marathons and getting in a few bike rides between nights of tomcatting and honky-tonking with Jake and Matthew . But it was while training for last month 's Leadville 100 , a brutal , high-altitude mountain bike race in Colorado , that he fell back in love , he says , " with the idea of riding my bike for five hours a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board of the Lance Armstrong Foundation approved a project called the Global Cancer Initiative  --  a follow-up to the LAF 's successful spearheading of Proposition 15 , which last year authorized up to $3 billion in bonds to fund cancer research in Texas . After Armstrong finished a strong second at Leadville , he phoned LAF president Doug Ulman and said he wanted back in the game . // It was a no-brainer to piggyback the Comeback upon the Initiative . The news created an international buzz . Last Tuesday , Armstrong 's agent , Bill Stapleton , took a call from former Australian prime minister John Howard , who asked if the Texan might race in next January 's Tour Down Under . ( The answer was yes . ) Armstrong , meanwhile , says he intends to lean on Howard to help jack up his nation 's anticancer budget , which Armstrong , donning his policy wonk 's hat , describes as " kind of small . " Asked by an Italian reporter if he 'll ride in the Giro d'Italia , Armstrong replied that he would very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi . " I would encourage Mr. Berlusconi to enact some cancer-related legislation . " // The latter exchange took place in a Manhattan hotel ballroom at the Clinton Global Initiative , or CGI , where Armstrong rolled out his GCI between hugs and confabs with many of his BFFs . After being introduced at the Opening Plenary by Bubba himself , Armstrong reminisced about his first White House visit : A seven-minute meet and greet in 1999 turned into a 47-minute bonding session after the cyclist complimented the President on a Rose Garden magnolia tree . ( Had he mentioned Hooters , one suspects , Armstrong might have been invited to dinner . ) Now there was Lance backstage at the CGI , catching up with Bono ; exchanging best wishes with Barbara Walters and Muhammad Ali ; buttonholing George H.W. Bush . Armstrong had a warm greeting for French president Nicolas Sarkozy. // It 's impossible to deny Armstrong 's devotion to his war of choice , and the passion and eloquence with which he wages it . At the CGI , he spoke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 killer of young women in Africa is cervical cancer .... By failing to act , by not applying the medicine that we have to the people that need it most , we are failing morally and ethically. " // Never in the annals of sport has an active athlete had such a bully pulpit , or so many presidents and prime ministers on speed dial . The ' 09 Tour de France will be immediately followed by the LAF 's Global Cancer Summit , where world leaders , ideally , will make commitments to battle cancer . And the yellow-bracelet brain trust is already pressuring the next U.S. president to attend . " Did you know , " Ulman notes , " that no American president has ever been to the Tour de France ? " // There has n't been much cause , since Armstrong got out of the game . Which brings us to the other giant upside of his unretirement : It will defibrillate his sport in this country . Yes , the teams Columbia and Garmin-Chipotle , with their strict anti-doping programs , have given fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycling back into the mainstream . Like him or not , he is a headline-generating machine . // As Armstrong well knows . He is driven by ego , yes , but also a desire to muzzle the doubters who do n't believe he was a clean champion . He has retained the services of Don Catlin , one of the world 's top antidoping detectives . Catlin , who will be paid by Astana , will subject his client to tests to ensure that he is clean , then make the results public . // " You could argue that this is the riskiest thing I 've ever done , " says Armstrong . " Say I get fifth in the Tour . There 'll be people who say , ' Uh-huh . Now that he 's clean , he comes in fifth . ' " Still , the cyclist sees his return to the races as a no-lose situation . " If I get fifth and five guys write , ' It 's because he was dirty before and he 's clean now '  --  but I 've effected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armstrong , " guess who wins ?
