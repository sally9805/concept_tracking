At Alexander McQueen fashion shows , everyone aims to turn heads , whether they 're McQueen groupies in never-worn-before pieces or editors in origami hats or vintage polka-dot bow-tie blouses . But at last fall 's show , the figure most eyes followed was that of a handsome stranger who arrived with Jonathan Newhouse , chairman of Conde Nast International , was greeted warmly by Domenico De Sole , CEO of Gucci Group ( owner of the McQueen label ) , and shown to an envied front-row seat . The fashion plebeians who did n't recognize him or his power-broker companions could n't miss his three-quarter-length woven leather coat by Bottega Veneta . Who was the guy smiling and schmoozing and wearing a $7,500 coat ? <P> He was Sheik Majed al-Sabah , 35 , a member of the Kuwaiti royal family . His mother Sheikha Amthal al-Ahmed al-Sabah is the favorite sister of Sheik Jaber al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah , the Kuwaiti Emir , and his uncle Saad al-Abdallah al-Salim al-Sabah is the country 's Prime Minister . <P> A distant relative of the leaders of a Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots , who often mingle with the likes of Queen Sofia of Spain or Queen Rania of Jordan . Designers and CEOs know , and care , about Majed al-Sabah because largely through his flashy exoticism and smarts  --  and , perhaps , wallet  --  he has become one of the most prominent retailers in fashion . <P> In spring 2001 , Majed al-Sabah opened Villa Moda , a 100,000-sq. - ft. mall-cum-boutique ( he calls it a " luxury bazaar " ) in a glass box on the outskirts of Kuwait City . The $20 million building is nearly as impressive as the swarm of big brands  --  Fendi , Marni , Ferragamo , Prada , Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent  --  clustered in mini shops inside , along with a Botox bar and a traditional Middle Eastern restaurant ( with nontraditional Cappellini furniture ) overlooking Kuwait Bay . To make sure the opening did n't go unnoticed , al-Sabah offered members of the international fashion set free business-class flights so they could celebrate with him at a $500,000 , three-day party . Some 200 of them , including Bloomingdale 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many fashion journalists , accepted . <P> Villa Moda shows why fashion is interested in Majed al-Sabah , but why is Majed al-Sabah interested in fashion ? His stock answer , " I 've always had a passion for fashion , " hardly explains why a could-be leader of his country would annoy his relatives by deflecting suggestions that he become the country 's next ambassador to Italy and instead go into a field so unseemly , so unmacho , so unimportant to global affairs . <P> Perhaps it 's because , as a rather burly teenage sheik , al-Sabah wanted to wear only loose-fitting clothes by avant-garde Japanese designers , difficult to obtain in Kuwait . His penchant for getting the hard-to-find became his vocation . In 1991 al-Sabah began visiting the top European fashion houses , begging them to let him carry their brands in Kuwait . None consented . Undeterred , al-Sabah went to the U.S. , where business was easier . " All the Americans wanted was a credit rating , " he says . And despite a few hiccups  --  the head of sales at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff , " We have enough outlets in South America "  --  al-Sabah managed to get all the big brands . In 1996 he finally cracked Europe .
