Sources familiar with Iran 's declaration say the country has admitted that it enriched uranium at the Kalay-e electric plant outside Tehran in violation of its agreements with the IAEA . The revelation is part of massive disclosures Tehran made in an attempt to avoid threatened international sanctions for its nuclear activities .
