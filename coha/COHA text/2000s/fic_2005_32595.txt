Chapter 1 : voyant Language , as Sylvia 's mother was fond of saying , mimics the human condition . What is harmless one moment can become fatal the next . Drop a prefix , and , before you know it , what was innocuous has grown noxious , dispensing fumes that are certain to kill you . Take voyeur , which derives from the French voirto see . A powerless or passive spectator . You might define it that way , if you were willing to strip away its unsavory meanings and free it from the clutches of Peeping Toms . Consider this : as a girl in Sacramento , Sylvia liked to climb trees . She started out in the fruit and nut trees of her neighborhood and then branched out , if you will , to the spreading oaks on the capitol grounds . Innocuous enough , you might say . Yet the physical pleasure she took in scrambling from limb to limb and hoisting herself into a hidden hollow was more than matched by her exhilaration with what she saw : a long-legged woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of terrier mutts humping in the early morning , the opened mouth of an ingenue as a sailor squeezed one of her smallish breasts . Now , as a woman in San Francisco , Sylvia takes a heightened pleasure in what she sees , but she no longer worries about concealing herself . When Sylvia moved to San Francisco last year , she found a one-bedroom apartment , three flights up , situated along the Hyde Street cable-car line . Home in the evenings , she watches the corner of Washington and Hyde through her curtainless front window . Sipping a glass of cheap burgundy and listening to a Bobby Darin record , Sylvia watches her neighbors , briefcases and sacks of groceries in tow , climb on and offthe cable car . She 's particularly fond of the balletic passengers , who spring onto or off of the car 's running board , even when it 's in motion . So far she has n't witnessed a single mishap among the leapers . Catlike , on their way to their various rendezvous , they bound from curb to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puddle in the famous photograph by Cartier-Bresson . Sylvia used to imagine that she was the Parisian in the photograph , her long , open-scissored leap , reflected in the pooling water , an emblem of decisiveness . Despite Sylvia 's good high-school Frenchher mother used to tell her that she was born to be a linguist or an impostor , maybe boththe closest Sylvia has gotten to Paris is through a monograph of Cartier-Bresson photos , a sampling of Debussy and Ravel recordings , and the lovely baguettes at Simon Brothers , flown in every other day from Paris , that she occasionally slips under her raincoat . Sometimes she pretends that it is Paris she 's watching out her window . Watcher might be another word she could apply to herself . Socially , it would make her more acceptable , but who wants to settle for a word so bereft of nuance ? Anyway , watchers have become as common as birds in 1962 , now that every man , woman , and child in America has a television of their own . Those few citizens not spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orbiting chimpanzees or astronauts . Sylvia prefers more intimate curiosities . One evening , shortly after moving to San Francisco , Sylvia took a random stroll down Van Ness Avenue and saw a symphony crowd billowing out of cabs and town cars and up the grand stairway to the lobby of the War Memorial Opera House . Although she was no more dressed for a concert than a woman walking her dog , she let herself get swept along with the crowd and , with neither dog nor ticket , climbed the stairs with the concertgoers and milled about the lobby , underdressed but unrepentant . She remembered how not long after the Second World War , as a seventh grader from Sacramento , she visited the Opera House , where delegates of fifty nations had drafted and signed the United Nations charter . She 'd imagined herself as a delegate from Ceylon , one of the exotic nations from which she had postage stamps . Seventeen years later , as she milled about in the lobby without a ticket , dressed in pedal pushers and a navy blue car coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Ceylon , Sylvia Bran . In September , as the anniversary of her first year in San Francisco nears , Sylvia gets an opportunity to attend a symphony concert at the Opera House . Her boss at Myerson 's " The grand piano store of the West " offers her a complimentary ticket . Although the ticket has a hole punched through it , Sylvia is ushered through a velvet curtain to a freestanding upholstered chair in a box of her own . She might as well be the queen of Ceylon . At first , it is hard to reconcile the formality of the setting and occasion with the casual , backstage banter that follows the musicians to their seats . Some of them tune their instruments on the fly amid a cacophony of scales and eighth-note passages . Then Inez Roseman appears onstage with her violin . Of course , Sylvia does n't yet know who the exquisite violinist is , but talk about regal . She wears her haira shade of blond that ca n't have come out of a bottlebrushed back , with a silver comb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cut from another cloth . The knots of standing musicians seem to part for her as she makes her way , without a word , toward the front of the first violin section . Is the stunning violinist contemptuous of her joking colleagues ? Do they despise her for acting as if she 's too good for this world ? Sylvia pays close attention to the violinist 's gesturesthe lovely way she brushes a hand under her skirt before sitting ; her manner of dropping a square of silk onto her left shoulder and shrugging it into place before lifting the violin and clamping it with her chin . The other violinists all seem to have more elaborate devices or padding to protect their chins and shoulders . This one , with her square of silk , is , in effect , riding bareback . The violinist closes her eyes as she begins to tune her instrument . Sylvia imagines the inner ear against which the violinist measures her A and pictures a flower within a flower . Clearly , the violinist has perfect pitch , a kind of magnetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college , Sylvia had known a French horn player with perfect pitch , and she 'd always wondered what it was like for him to live among the common folk with wavering intonation . The dashing Brazilian conductor , Joo Bonfa , gives his downbeat , and the opening measure of an orchestral suite by Berlioz rises to Sylvia 's box . She is sitting close enough to study the supple grace of the violinist 's bow arm , and , gradually , locks into the breathing pattern of the silk-shouldered beauty . At intermission , Sylvia asks an usher the name of the first violinist sitting second stand outside . " That 's Inez Roseman ; beautiful Inez . " The elderly matron , whose white hair is slipping out of its chignon , turns her head dismissively . Is the gesture meant as a comment on the violinist or on the philistine posing the question ? Sylvia decides the latter . Maybe the usher remembers her complimentary ticket , the one with the hole punched through it , and holds that against her . " Has she been with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " the usher says , turning toward Sylvia . " She 's been in the symphony for nearly twenty years . " " How could that be ? She does n't look like she 's much past thirty . " " Well , I 'm not lying to you . Some of us age better than others . " The usher takes a linen hanky from her clutch and , unfolding it , reveals a small stash of lemon drops . She offers one to Sylvia . " No , thank you . " The matron plucks a lemon drop from her linen wrap and drops it on her tongue . " Of course , Inez got into the symphony when she was very young . " " She 'd have had to . " " And you know who she 's married to , " the usher says , in a stage whisper . " No , I 'm afraid I do n't . " " Jake Roseman . " The usher puckers her lips around her lemon drop . " You know , the attorney who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has read about him in the Chronicle . He seems to be something of a sensationalist . A white lawyer working on behalf of the Negroes , a favorite of the liberal columnists . " I 'll tell you one thing , " the usher says , " the man has no feeling for music , even though his father played in the symphony for years . " " His father played ? " Sylvia asks . " His father was the first concertmaster under Monteux . He was Inez 's teacher . But you never see the husband here . Maybe he 'll come next month when Inez plays her solo . If we 're so lucky . " " What will she be playing ? " The usher puts her hands on her hips . " My , you ask a lot of questions . You ought to be a reporter . " " I am a reporter , " Sylvia says , tasting the words as she speaks them . " What do you know ? " The matron 's eyes brighteneverything seems to make sense to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , " Sylvia says . " Your last question ? " " What will Mrs. Roseman be playing ? " " Oh , yes , the Goldmark Concerto . " " I 'm afraid I 'm not familiar with Goldmark . " " Karl Goldmark . " " And when did he live ? " The usher looks flustered . " When did he . . . ? He was . . . " Her hands go up to her hair and flutter in their crooked , arthritic way around the loose knot of her chignon . " He was a Romantic . " " Of course . " Now the old woman , a flirt at heart , narrows her eyes and offers a gamine smile . She holds out her hand to Sylvia . " Elizabeth Mier . That 's Mier , M I E R. " Does Elizabeth Mier expect her to jot down the correct spelling of her name ? Sylvia takes her hand . " Pleased to meet you , " she says without offering her own name . The power of the press . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the curious constellation of the Roseman family has woven itself around her . The French have another word , a first cousin of voyeur that has n't really crossed over into English . Voyant . We do have clairvoyant , but how much more elegant to be a voyant , a simple seer . Back in her seat , Sylvia Bran 's career as a voyant is about to begin . As the lovely violinist walks back onstage and drops her square of silk onto her shoulder , Sylvia holds her breath .
