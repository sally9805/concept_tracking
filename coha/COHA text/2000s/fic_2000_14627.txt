Ainsley sits at a kitchen table with nine glass-bottled beers on it . AINSLEY BELCHER I never drank nine beers before . I feel strangely free . Ethan , bring me my toe out of the refrigerator , will you ? I like to see my toe when I 'm drunk . ( He brings the toe . It 's in a ziplock sandwich bag . ) Thanks . Two and a half years old , an ' I cut this baby clean off with a snow shovel the night Momma went to the hospital to have you . You ingrate . One of a thousand sacrifices , baby brother . If ol ' Reuben had n't a come along drunk as a lord , I might have bled to death , but , more importantly , I would never , never have played the oboe . Did you know Reuben played with the Boston Symphony Orchestra for thirty years ? That old drunk , who would have thought it . He 's got crystal pure tone . You play a duet with Reuben , you downright feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( She opens the ziplock and dumps the toe into her hand . ) They sewed this baby on an ' it lasted fourteen years till it snapped off that time I fell when I was doing cross-country . I believe the moral to be that you ca n't put something broken back together . Not in the long run . This has proved true in all three of my romantic relationships . In each one , we split an ' then came back together an ' then broke off forever . The toe knows . ( She puts it back in the bag. )                                                                                       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
