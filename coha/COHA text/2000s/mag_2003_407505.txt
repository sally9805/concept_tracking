// " OK , Dave . What 's the matter ? You 're moping . " " No , I 'm not , Mom . " " Well , if you 're not moping , you 're doing an excellent imitation of a blood-hound , with its face all drooping and its chin practically dragging on the ground . " I slump into the chair next to Mom 's desk . How can I explain so she 'll understand ? " It 's about the class assignment Ms. McGuire gave us on the second day of school . " Mom does n't look up from her typing . " Let me guess . An essay on how you spent your summer vacation . " If it were just an essay , I would n't be worried . Then Ms. McGuire would be the only one to find out how I spent most of my summer . " It 's worse than that , Mom . She 's turning the assignment into a show-and-tell , almost . She wants us to bring in something we learned to do during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class . It 's to prove we 're learning even when we 're not in school . " Mom looks at me over her glasses . " Mike 's bringing a box kite he made at a workshop in the park , " I say . " Michelle learned to weave baskets , and Maria has tomatoes and zucchini she grew organically in her garden . " " Sounds like an interesting idea to me , Dave . What 's the problem ? " She puts another sheet of paper into the typewriter . I knew she would n't understand . " Mom ! What am I supposed to show ? Diapers and baby food ? Most of the time all I did was babysit Robby ! " " Dave , without you , there 's no way I could have finished my reports . " She turns and smiles at Robby curled in his blanket , asleep on the rug . " And besides , you did a terrific job . " " Thanks , Mom . It 's just that . . . baby food and diapers ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . he catches sight of me , grins , and then shrieks , " Day-be ! " It 's one of the words I taught him . My name , Davey . He pushes himself to his feet , toddles over , and armlocks my neck in a hug . For a baby brother , he 's OK . Then it hits me . I know what I can take to class . On the day it 's my turn to speak , I start thinking that maybe my great idea is n't so great after all . The other kids are looking at me as if I 'm covered with warts or something . Me . . . with Robby in my arms , holding onto his baby bag full of baby stuff . I almost change my mind , but Maria says , " I wish I 'd thought of that . " She looks after her baby sister . // Maria helps spread Robby 's blanket on Ms. McGuire 's desk for him to sit on . I dump his favorite toys around him , liking this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he 's scared ? He 's sitting there , staring at everyone , not letting go of my hand . " It 's OK , Robby . Trust me . " I cross my fingers and pick up Robby 's squeaky yellow duck . I squeeze it twice and gently toss it into his lap . Good old Rob : he breaks into a grin , showing every tooth he owns . he grabs the duck by its beak and tosses it at me . Well , his aim is n't that great , so he misses my outstretched hands by a mile and actually hits Ms. McGuire , who 's sitting in the front row . Boink ! All the kids laugh . Once she recovers from her surprise , Ms. McGuire laughs , too . Then she squeezes the duck and tosses it back . Robby bounces up and down , waving his hands in the air , having a great time playing his favorite game . // I clear my throat and begin my talk , with the duck flying back and forth across the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of my summer caring for him . I learned to change his diapers , feed him , figure out what was wrong when he cried , and keep him out of trouble . I played games with him , took him for walks , and I 'm teaching him to talk . " There 's no way I 'm going to be embarrassed by what I did . It was a lot more complicated than building a box kite , that 's for sure . " Robby 's healthy and happy partly because I learned how to take care of him . " Then , as if Robby and I had practiced a zillion times , Robby raises his hands over his head and starts clapping . Ms. McGuire joins in . Then so do all the kids , with Maria clapping the loudest . <p>
