The heart , Woody Allen said , wants what it wants . For the producers of the ABC reality show The Dating Experiment , that was a problem . The heart of one of their female participants did not want what they needed it to want . She disliked one of her suitors , but it would make a better story if she liked him . So they sat her down for an interview . Who 's your favorite celebrity ? they asked . She replied that she really loved Adam Sandler . Later , in the editing room , they spliced out Sandler 's name and dropped in audio of her saying the male contestant 's name . <P> That 's love , reality-style . This trick , says Todd Sharp , who was a program consultant on the series , is called Frankenbiting . And it happens more often than you may suspect . Frankenbites , he says , are the work of " desperate people who had to deliver a story in a few days "  --  producers under pressure to deliver a tidy story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pantheon of shocking headlines , REALITY SHOWS MANIPULATED ranks with PORK RINDS FATTENING , RESEARCHERS SUSPECT . But even savvy viewers who realize that their favorite reality shows are cast , contrived and edited to be dramatic may have no idea how brazen the fudging can be . Quotes are manufactured , crushes and feuds constructed out of whole cloth , episodes planned in multiact " storyboards " before taping , scenes stitched together out of footage shot days apart . <P> And while we may have long suspected that a cast of camera-smitten future trivia answers ca n't really be that interesting without professional help , details of how these shows manipulate reality have begun leaking out  --  because of a dispute with the employees hired to do the jiggering . Those staff members  --  who create story lines , coach interview answers and cobble together video  --  say their work amounts to writing , and they are suing their networks and production companies , arguing that they deserve to be covered by the Writers Guild of America . <P> Their employers call them story editors , segment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union employees . Those designations save money  --  Guild members have better pay , benefits and protections . But they also preserve an illusion : that the shows are authentic and true to life , free of anything close to " writing . " <P> It 's not that the shows have line-for-line scripts ( although reality writers have charged that Paris Hilton was fed lines on The Simple Life ) . But Jeff Bartsch , a freelance reality-show editor , says there are many ways of using footage to shape a story . Bartsch worked on Blind Date , a syndicated dating show that features hookups gone right  --  and comically wrong . If a date was dull or lukewarm , the editors would juice the footage by running scenes out of order or out of context . To make it seem like a man was bored , they would cut from his date talking to a shot of him looking around and unresponsive  --  even though it was taken while she was in the restroom and he was alone .
