Section : healthy pet TAKE THE HO-HUM OUT OF DOG OBEDIENCE TRAINING <p> Ever catch yourself procrastinating as you prepare to walk your dog ? You can feel boredom building inside you . I 've got news for you  --  your dog gets bored too . And a bored dog can quickly become mischievous and destructive . <p> Who says dog walks must be monotonous ? Certainly not Jazz , my 1-year-old Pembroke Welsh corgi . We turn our walk into an adventure : We never take the same route or go for the same duration , and he keeps a steady eye on me because he never knows when the next treat will be coming or the next command given . Make It Fun <p> One of Jazz 's favorite games is the pace game . As he walks by my side , I may suddenly say , " S-l-o-w , " in a long monotone voice . That 's the cue for Jazz to move from a steady gait to a slow-motion crawl . Then I say in a hurried tone , " Fast , fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a near run with his short legs scurrying to match my rapid-moving stride . Each time he complies , he 's rewarded with a small food treat or praise . " The more you can make walks and basic obedience training less boring for your dog , and the more exercise and mental stimulation you provide him , the more you will be able to head off potential behavior problems due to boredom , " says Alice Moon-Fanelli , PhD , an assistant clinical professor at Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine and an animal behaviorist . <p> The more fun commands you give , the more your dog will focus on you and be less prone to distractions , such as other dogs or squirrels , during your walks . This purposeful play gives you greater control over your dog , who now sees you as a leader who deserves to be respected . Lifesaving Commands <p> COME The number one command all dogs must heed is " Come . " It can truly be a lifesaver , especially if your dog is heading out toward a busy street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Develop a reliable recall by fastening a long clothesline  --  about 40 feet to your dog 's collar . Let him sniff and explore ahead of you and then , in an upbeat tone , say his name followed by " Come , " as you reel him back with the clothesline . When he comes to you , gently grab his collar , hand him a treat without bending over , take a few strides side by side , and then say , " Okay , go play , " as you loosen up the line . <p> " This technique will encourage your dog to come back to you because he knows that party time is not over when he obeys . In fact , it is just beginning , " says Moon-Fanelli . " Never use ' come ' as a command for something unpleasant to your dog such as to signal the end of your outing . Instead say , ' Let 's go . ' You want your dog to associate ' come ' with good things , so he will be more responsive to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dog racing away from you is " Drop , " says Susan Greenbaum , a professional dog trainer and owner of Barking Hills Country Club in Milford , NJ . This is an emergency drop , always done in movement . " Drop " is an ideal command if you accidentally let go of your leash , and your dog starts to dash away . <p> Teach this drop command by sitting in a chair and sticking out your left leg . If your dog is small , sit on the floor , and raise your leg so that your dog must lower himself to get under it . Place a treat in your right hand , and move your hand under your left leg . Lure your dog under your left leg , say , " Drop , " and as soon as his elbows touch the ground , say , " Yes , " and give the treat . Then as your dog performs this well , add a new element : Release the leash as you say , " Drop . " Final step : Practice walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collar without having him jump up . This gets him used to hearing the sound of the leash clipping before you give him the release command to stand up , says Greenbaum . Practice the " drop " command in your backyard , and then head to a park . Work His Brain <p> Pia Silvani , a certified dog trainer at St. Hubert 's Animal Welfare Center in Madison , NJ , encourages dog owners to incorporate basic obedience commands into everyday situations . If you have a dog that loves to retrieve , you can work on " sit , " " down , " " stay , " and " come " commands during playtime . <p> " Lance , my Belgian Tervuren , is Frisbee crazy , " she says . " I 've taught him that he must sit or lie down before I toss it . I taught him to come to me once he retrieves it , and then to stay before I toss it again . When you blend basic commands into play , your dog is more apt to obey . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holding a treat in her hand , she has a dog quickly move from sits to downs , so that he looks like he 's doing push-ups . " The doggie push-up command gets a dog 's attention , " Greenbaum says . If you see that he is about to chase a squirrel , you can have him do some doggie push-up because he knows he will get a treat . " <p> Adds Silvani , " Positive reinforcement training has been proven to enhance the relationship bond between dog and owner . When you learn creative ways to motivate your dog , you eliminate a lot of behavior problems and have a much happier relationship with your dog .
