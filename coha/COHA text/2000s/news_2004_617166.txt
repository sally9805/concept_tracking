<p> NAN THAI FINE DINING , ** <p> 1350 Spring St. , downtown . 404-870-9933 . <p> THAI PEOPLE , at least the ones I know , hate Thai restaurants . They do n't deem the food spicy enough or authentic enough , or as good as what they can cook at home . Plus , they all say , real Thai food is street food . It 's just plain wrong to eat pad thai noodles off of porcelain plates amidst brass elephants and busboys in bow ties . <p> I usually nod politely in silent disagreement when I hear this line because , frankly , I like fancy Thai restaurants . My favorite for years has been Midtown 's Tamarind  --  a place that has always managed to overcome its **27;6435;TOOLONG locale alongside the I-75/85 connector with warm style , fine service and spot-on cooking . The food has never been outrageously exotic or markedly different from that at other Thai joints around town . But it has , at least to my palate , been better . The curries are striated with complex flavors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rice is never less than perfect . <p> For more than three years , owners Charlie and Nan Niyomkul have been hoping to open a second restaurant that indeed would take Thai cooking in Atlanta to a new level . From the earliest stages , they talked of offering a nightly chef 's table and regional dishes heretofore unseen in Atlanta . Perhaps this would be a place to unite skeptical Thais and non-native fans of the food . Nan , the chef , made frequent food study trips to Thailand . Charlie , the popular host , secured investors , the city 's best-known restaurant design firm and a prominent site at the foot of the 17th Street bridge . <p> Now the bridge is open to traffic , and the restaurant  --  Nan Thai Fine Dining  --  to business . " Fine dining " is the operative phrase for this dressy , opulent spot . In a town where new restaurant design is an event , Nan is the belle of the winter ball . The Johnson Studio has devised a scheme for this lofty space in white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regal but not " The King and I. " The central dining area is raised and harmoniously open , the pillars soaring , the booths calfskin soft , the brass tableware lovely , and the waitresses  --  pressing their palms together in the wai greeting  --  even lovelier . <p> The cooking , though very good , seems to have less to do with Thai regional cooking than with Thai fusion . Rosy lamb chops bathed in a mild curry , whole fried snapper and Maine lobster tail in rice flour cream sauce  --  all of it looking like a million bucks  --  are the hallmarks of this kitchen . Think of Nan in the same breath as Roy 's and Bluepointe : state-of-the-art Asian crossover cooking . <p> There seems to be one surefire way to order at Nan . Go for a bright-flavored , sophisticated salad and then settle on one of the excellent curries that are the kitchen 's pride . My favorite dish at Nan is a toss of crisp-fried snapper bits and green mango julienne with roasted peanuts and see-through slivers of lemongrass hearts . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iced crudites and chili dipping sauce make as nice a gussying-up of Thai beef salad as you could hope for . <p> Another way to start  --  best for a larger group  --  is with Chef Nan 's Blue Plate that lets you sample your way through the starters . They arrive in a virtuoso display of carved fruits , radish roses , lacquer and porcelain . I especially like the kanom jeeb dumplings filled with chicken and shrimp . They 're like elegant , juicy shu mai and they arrive cradled in a Chinese soup spoon with mushroom soy vinegar . Purple tea rose dumplings filled with chicken , pickled radish and crushed peanuts are lovely to the eye but dry on the tongue . Chewy beef satay , fried calamari and juiceless coconut shrimp seem to have wandered over from a middlin ' tapas bar . They seem more like bar nosh than anything . <p> While you 're waiting for your entrees , check out the long , cylindrical objects pointing forth from the ceiling tiles in the side room like ray guns from " Flesh Gordon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they certainly add some fun schwing to the feng shui . The other decor detail that everyone talks about is the massive bronze tamarind pod outside . I 'm just so not going there . Look at the picture and provide your own metaphor . <p> Things certainly pick up with the main course , particularly if it involves coconut . The kitchen has imported a nifty coconut milk extractor from Thailand , so the curries taste , subtly but persistently , of fresh fruit rather than cans . Braised beef short ribs , as soft as a down pillow , come in a sweet masaman curry that unpacks layers of flavor on your tongue , while the roasted rack of lamb arrives with a simpler yellow curry . <p> My favorite dish is the Thai-style whole sizzling fish  --  here , a snapper  --  in a dry green curry with Holy basil and whole clusters of green peppercorns . It 's the same dish I 've had prepared with catfish in other Thai restaurants , but here the freshness of the snapper adds another dimension of flavor . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it needed a shot of fish sauce and a bit more heat . Even this most fiery of Thai dishes is fairly tame at Nan . <p> If you do want to try some of the regional Thai dishes the Niyomkuls keep talking about , good luck . I 've had none . I 've asked servers if there are any specialties I could order , but they all point to the chef 's table by the kitchen and tell me to come back with a large group . For $75 a head , chef Nan will cook a special menu with drinks included . <p> And so I head back with a group of six . It turns out chef Nan is out of town ( You think they might have told me ? ) and her chef de cuisine walks us through what is essentially a best-hits tour of the menu . The wine provided is a clumsy , inappropriate chardonnay  --  all oak and residual sugar  --  that I soon trade in for a Singha beer . <p> The appetizers come out course by course , pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table in a great curried whoosh : lamb chops , pork tenderloin , lobster , shellfish . There were also some rice and noodles , but mostly a whole lot of competing curries bleeding into each other on the plate . It 's not something you 'd see in Thailand , where one curry would share the table with contrasting dishes . The meal ends with a soapy-tasting lemongrass pot de creme and a whole lot of leftovers . <p> When I tell the manager afterward that although the food was good I was expecting something more traditional , more exotic or more off-menu , he seems surprised . Why , I 'm not sure since ( a ) this is what the restaurant promotes and ( b ) one of my guests engaged him in conversation in Thai . But to his great credit he insisted on reducing the bill if we gave the chef 's table another chance . <p> We certainly will . With its attentive service , gorgeous setting and decorous food , Nan is just the kind of restaurant I 'll be back to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high as that at Tamarind . <p> Hopefully one day the Niyomkuls will make good on their offer to teach us more about their native cooking and challenge our palates . I think we all , Thais and non-Thais , can take it . Overall rating : ** Food : Rich , tasty Thai and Thai fusion dishes that emphasize presentation . Service : Gracious , swift and evidently well managed , but too eager to interrupt your conversation with table ministrations . One time I felt like treating my waitress to a bad Yul Brynner imitation if she tried to cap off my sparkling water one more time .
