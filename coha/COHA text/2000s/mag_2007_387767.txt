. ALYSSA IACOBONI WAS N'T GOING TO LET CANCER STOP HER FROM BECOMING A HUNTER , AND NEITHER WAS HER FAMILY OR THE STRANGERS WHO GAVE HER THE HUNT OF A LIFETIME . IF YOU 'RE LOOKING FOR AN UNLIKELY PAIR , match the fresh-faced girl with two earrings in her right ear sitting with the cowpuncher with the droopy gray mustache , sweat-stained hat , and dusty jeans . He is leaning more than halfway over the coffee table in the windblown desert town of Rock Springs , Wyo. , here in the lobby of the Best Western , and holding both her hands in his upright palms . He holds them like precious things he might break were he not careful , and behind a three-day stubble and his weathered features , he is smiling so hard as to be on the verge of tears . " I been looking forward to this more than any hunt I 've booked all year , " he tells her . " We 're gon na get you a good deer , honey . I promise you that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down off the mountains now , coming down into their winter range . The big ones tend to move last . Oh , honey , I 'm so glad you 're finally here . " He turns and smiles at the girl 's father , sitting next to her on the couch . " You have to hunt with me ... forever . Every year . You and your dad . On me . Understand ? " She blushes , glows , looks at her father , then back at the cowboy . He is serious . She hardly knows him , but he is , here and now , making a commitment that will last as long as either of them lives . The cowboy drops his eyes for a moment , giving her time to take it all in . But she does n't need time . She neither flusters nor embarrasses nor flees to the safety of a polite protest that it is too great a gift . She smiles . He coughs , then continues in a different tone . " Now , it 's okay to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , cocking his head in my direction but keeping his eyes on her . " Just remember , " he says , slowly tapping his chest with a forefinger , " I 'm your number one . " His eyes are watering again . The gray mustache that obscures his mouth stays put while the silk bandanna around his throat rises and then settles back into its place . Her eyes dance and change with the light , sometimes hazel , sometimes green . She is beautiful . Her metal crutches lean against the back of the sofa . She has been waiting for this moment forever , nearly 10 months , since last winter at a sporting show in Grand Rapids , when her two brothers wheeled her by the booth of the outfitter who had agreed to work with the Hunt of a Lifetime charity . That was when the man asked her and her father to be his guests for a mule deer hunt . Her name is Alyssa Iacoboni and she is 15 years old . Her head is smooth . Her eyebrows and eyelashes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insists that a few eyelashes are already growing back ) . It is as if her head and face in their unashamed nakedness permit her beauty to shine stronger . She is unselfconscious about her appearance : her lack of hair , and the stump of leg that stops above where her left knee once was . She smiles and talks freely . Yet she holds within herself a world that is hers alone . Later , photographer Erika Larsen and I will discover that we both thought of Vermeer 's famous painting , Girl With a Pearl Earring , upon first seeing Alyssa . In that picture a similarly luminous girl has just turned her gaze to the viewer , as if someone has just entered her room . Vermeer chose to portray his girl without hair , too , though hers by virtue of the blue and gold cloth that covers it completely . It is a trick the artist used to draw your eye to her expression . Both share that startling combination of openness and self-containment , present and vivid , yet reserving unto themselves a mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the North for its haunting beauty , was done more than 300 years ago . Alyssa Iacoboni ( Yaka-Boni ) is right here . And if she bears a wisdom beyond her years , she is also very much a 15-year-old girl . " I am so psyched to go on this hunt , " she says . " My brothers are totally jealous . " Just two weeks ago , she killed her first whitetail , a doe on 37 acres the family owns not far from home in Grand Rapids . Her father , Evan , says she is weary from the trip , from delays that caused them to arrive at 4 A.M. , instead of 10 P.M. THE NEXT MORNING , WE CARAVAN to the unit where the outfitter , Bruce Feri , who runs Canyon Creek Outfitters , has a special tag for Alyssa 's buck . It 's high desert country , about 7,500 feet , an endless undulating carpet of sage west of the never-ending spine of the Wind River Mountains . We load up in trucks and head up into the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hydraulic leg but is still on crutches at the moment . She hops nimbly into the cab and stows them beside her . I ask about the doe she took . " I 'd taken my hunter safety even before I got sick , but did n't have a chance to hunt until this year . First I was nervous when I went out with my brothers . I was afraid I might not like hunting as much as they did . But when I saw that doe , I got so excited I could hear my own heart . It was so intense . And then I made a good shot with the .30/30 and I was even more excited . It was just really cool . " She has been practicing with a .22 magnum , and her brothers helped her sight in the new .308 that Savage Arms donated to Hunt of a Lifetime . There was already a foundation , Make-A-Wish , for young people facing life-threatening illnesses . In 1996 , it granted a seriously ill Minnesota boy 's wish to hunt Kodiak brown bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prompting them to mount a national campaign against Make-A-Wish . Some members were threatened with bodily harm . When Tina Pattison , a school bus driver and mother of six in Erie County , Pa. , told the group that her son Matthew , an 18-year-old with Hodgkin 's disease , wanted more than anything to hunt moose in Canada , she was told the foundation could no longer grant such wishes . It simply was n't safe . But Pattison was not the type to be intimidated . She and her husband , Chester , got mad . Then they got on the phone . In time , thanks to the hard work of his parents and the generosity of some outfitters , a lodge , a grocery store , and countless others , Matthew and his dad went on the hunting trip and bagged a 55-inch moose . The anticipation of the hunt kept him going through months of pain , Tina says . " He kept saying , " I 'll be all right because I 'm going on that moose hunt . ' ' " Matthew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Tina founded Hunt of a Lifetime to honor Matthew 's memory and to grant the wishes of other youngsters who love hunting and the outdoors . As we drive and glass muleys tucked away in the sagebrush , Bruce explains that this is the Sublette herd , the most migratory deer in the West . They travel up to 100 miles from the Salt River , Wyoming , Wind River , Gros Ventre , and Snake River ranges to winter in the desert of the Green River Basin . " They 'll stay around here as long as the wind blows the snow off the vegetation . If the snow gets too heavy for that , they 'll just keep heading south . Come spring , they 'll follow the snow line back up into the mountains . " The deer have a tough life , he says . " Sometimes it gets to 40 , 50 below up here . That 's without windchill . It does n't stay that cold for long , but they ca n't stand it for long , either . Come spring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The state recently pushed back the date that shed hunters can start walking in this area in the spring for fear of stressing the deer at a critical time . Alyssa does n't say anything , but she has some experience of her own at the margins , the places where the distance between life and death is as thin as onion skin . Bruce stops the truck and pulls out a spotting scope . It 's a bright , windy day in the low 60s , warmer than usual , warmer than he 'd like . There was a dusting of snow a few days ago . He points out four groups of muleys dotting the landscape , numbering nearly 50 in all . " Now let 's see if we can find you a good buck . " He glasses about six , all with does . It is just before the rut , the females not yet ready but tolerating the bucks , which merely jockey for position rather than fight . Bruce gives his 10-power Swarovski to Alyssa and shows her a bedded 4x4 nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the gray deer hiding in plain sight . " I see him now , " she says . Bruce clucks his tongue , thinking it over . " He 's not bad , but we can do better . " He shoves the truck back in gear . UNTIL SHE WAS SENT THE TERRIBLE blessing of cancer , Alyssa had been just another normal  --  if abnormally successful  --  schoolgirl . She was popular , the girl elected to represent her class at the homecoming dance , an athlete who played basketball and volleyball and ran track . She was the fastest kid in her junior high , just half a second off the school record in the 200 meters . High school coaches were already scouting her . She also did the long jump and shot put . I tell her that she looks too light to be a shot-putter . " Yeah , I know . Everybody thinks it 's about upper body strength , but it 's more about using your body the right way , momentum and leverage . " Her brothers , Daniel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both set on becoming sheriff 's deputies  --  helped her learn that . Then one day she came home from basketball camp complaining of pain in her left leg . At first the doctors just thought it was hyperextended and counseled rest . Eventually , they X-rayed it and saw the tumor in her knee , an aggressively can cerous mass in the bones . They scheduled her for an appointment with the oncologist for the next day and gave her a name for the disease : osteosarcoma , bone cancer . Two weeks later she was on her way to Detroit for her first surgery . Another hour into the hunt , the sun high now , Bruce spots a better buck in the company of about 10 does . A subordinate buck lingers in the brush nearby , causing the big one to assert his dominance and move the ladies . The smaller male invariably shadows them . " Good and bad , " Bruce says . " They 're moving , but distracted enough that we might get close . " He , Alyssa , and I aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but soon 12 pairs of eyes have us pinned . Then they take off running . " Do n't worry , " Bruce tells her as she swings her way back on the crutches . " We 'll get you one . You feeling tired or anything ? " She shakes her head . " I 'm fine . " The diagnosis changed everything . It was as if a portal had opened into a parallel universe , a world invisible to those who live on the surface . All at once Alyssa could no longer measure joys and sorrows by a schoolgirl 's standards : cute clothes and the coolest ringtones , popularity and which group you were going with to the football game . When the social worker assigned to her case asked if the idea of dying scared her , Alyssa confronted her parents . Were they keeping something from her ? No , honey , they said . We 'll never keep anything from you . They told her that her cancer was serious , possibly terminal , but that they would take things one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fight for her life . The possibility of death , someone wrote , tends to focus the mind rather intensely . Alyssa seemed to decide quickly that she still had the three things that mattered most to her : her family , her faith in God , and her belief in herself . That was not to say there were n't times she cried , times she lashed out at her parents , or times when she despaired . But for the most part she showed what many kids show , only more of it : an acceptance of the situation and its possible outcomes that an adult can only envy , and a resolve to fight . " I just realized it would n't do any good to be negative , " she says . " It does n't help , does n't make you stronger . It 's like when you 're behind in a basketball game . You just focus on what you need to do to get back in it . " Her faith had always been important to her , and it became even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite verse , 29:11 from the book of Jeremiah : " For I know the plans I have for you , " declares the Lord , " plans to prosper you and not to harm you , plans to give you hope and a future . " She was in God 's hands . Whatever happened , it was what He had chosen for her . She could live with that . If necessary , she could die with it . We drive some more , stop and eat sandwiches , chew and look at the country . It 's sparse and clean and pitiless . Alyssa seems at ease but does n't say much , does n't readily reveal herself . I will wonder about this so much that I will call her mom , Linda , after the trip . She will tell me her daughter 's composure unnerved her as well . " At each new turn in her illness , she was like , okay , let 's fix this and keep going . She is incredibly competitive , I can tell you that . The coaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relays , both for her speed and because she absolutely refuses to lose . " During Alyssa 's last race , she tells me , the girl handing her the baton dropped it before the pass . " But it was still in the lane , so Alyssa picked it up . And I remember feeling the crowd 's reaction , how they did n't think she could catch up . But she did . And she won . She has always been the kind of girl you do n't want to say , " I bet you ca n't " or " I dare you " to . She 's not insecure , but she has always lived her life like she 's got something to prove . " The doctors eventually told her they needed to take the leg . She was offered " limb salvage , " in which a combination of cadaver bone , metal rods , and bone grafts enable a patient to keep an arm or leg . But she would n't be able to run on such a leg , and there were other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection , loosening of the implanted bone , and mechanical failure . On December 7 , 2005 , she let surgeons amputate her left leg above the knee . She also underwent intensive chemo , six rounds of three treatments each . Chemo , she tells me , is as much torture as it is therapy . The poisons kill the cancer cells , the fastest-growing ones in the body , but they kill everything else as well . The theory behind it is brutally simple : Inflict as much destruction upon the body as possible while still leaving the subject " viable . " As soon as the patient has recovered from the last round to the point where she can be expected to survive more , more is administered . Alyssa became so sick that her mother figures she attended school a total of 10 days during her ninth-grade year . She took drugs to flush the chemicals from her body between courses of chemo , drugs to cope with the excruciating " phantom pain " from the nonexistent leg . The human brain , perhaps perceiving that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nerve cells in that area to register a traumatic event . Her immunity plummeted to nothing , leaving her defenseless against normally mundane maladies . A nosebleed might last for eight hours and require an emergency trip back to the hospital for a transfusion . Sores in her mouth and nasal passages became infected and required intravenous antibiotics and morphine . She seemed to live at the hospital . Her sense of smell and taste became abnormally acute . The odor of hospital food made her ill . Liz , a 17-year-old friend she had made in the hospital who had a more advanced form of the same cancer , died . " It was hard " is all she 'll say . She does n't dramatize the death , does n't choke up about it for your benefit , does n't use it to make some point about her own suffering . " It was hard when Liz died , " she says . She reminds me of soldiers I 've talked to who have survived extended combat . Such men tend to be low-key to the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or even the attention  --  of others . Any questions about their identity , or worth , or place in life have already been settled . They know that each breath is a gift . BRUCE ABRUPTLY STOPS AND BRINGS his binocs up to his eyes . " Shooter buck , " he tells me . He backs the truck slowly and angles it to get his window broadside so he can put the spotting scope on the buck . " That 's the best one I 've seen in a while , " he says . Two bucks and two does are feeding about 500 yards away . Studying the lay of the land , however , we see there is no good approach . They are on a little ridge in the sagebrush , higher than everything around them . " Have to throw the dice , " he says . Our only option is to drive a little closer before making a right that will take us into a fold in the land from which we could sneak on them . " If we could get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a boulder , " we might be close enough for a shot . " He creeps forward and makes the right , then moves steadily onward . The deer do not take alarm . After a few more minutes , they all bed down : two does about 25 feet away from the bucks , the second of which is much smaller . We get out the .308 and a tripod to steady it on . Bruce asks Alyssa if she can crawl the last 50 yards to the rock or if she 'd prefer to be carried . " I can crawl , " she says . " I 'm gon na hustle up to that rock , make sure they 're not spooked , and try to range " em , " says Bruce . Alyssa hops down from the cab and gets her crutches . I sling the gun across my back so I can crawl when we get close . We set off , Alyssa planting her foot , then swinging forward with her crutches . Each time she moves them , she swings them either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise . I walk doubled over , staying as low as I can . We travel for about 100 yards this way toward Bruce , who is pressed to the rock , his hat on the ground behind him , rising as slow as a snake to peer over with his binocs . He drops back just as slowly , gives us a thumbs-up , and motions that we 'll have to cover the rest of the distance prone . Alyssa balances on her foot as she places the crutches quietly on the ground . Then she lowers herself down to her two elbows and one knee and begins to pull herself over the ground . At last we make it to Bruce and the rock , which is barely big enough to screen us even if we bunch up . Bruce whispers for the shooting tripod , but we have left it behind . I take off my parka and pass it forward . He folds it across the rock . I insert the clip , quietly chamber a round , check that the safety is on , and pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position , sitting on her folded knee . All four deer are bedded now , the two does to the right of the bucks . The little buck is bedded left of the bigger one and is easier to see . Bruce wants to make sure she is sighting on the bigger one . The sun is nearly in front of us , and she is having trouble seeing through the scope because of it . At last , she says , " Got him . Oh my gosh . " Bruce claps her gently on the back . " We 've got " em where we want " em , honey . That is a really nice buck . You just try to stay on him . " He looks again through his glasses , then ranges the buck . " Two hundred yards , " he says . He tells her to relax . We just have to wait now for the buck to get up and offer a good shot . Minutes pass . Bruce is in an awkward position and needs to drop down and rest every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buck , to wait until he rises and turns broadside , then to shoot just behind the front leg and midway up the body . I sneak a look and watch through the glasses as the big buck lays his head down so that just the four tines on his left side are showing , nothing more than tiny glints of sunlight 200 yards off . We sit some more . I 'm lying on my side and it 's getting wet , the last of the snowmelt still pooled on the ground . Just then , Alyssa says , " They 're getting up ! " She has had to shift slightly , causing the bill of her blaze orange cap to slide over her eyes . When she adjusts it , she can no longer find the buck . And the sun , lower now , is lined up almost directly behind the four standing deer . " I ca n't see them , " she says , and her voice is plaintive and desperate . Bruce repositions her hat a second time to cut down on the glare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and I can see clearly . " I still do n't have them , " Alyssa moans . " Keep looking , honey , " Bruce says soothingly . The barrel of the rifle is waggling . She is way off now . I 'm worried . I 'm worried that she 'll acquire the wrong buck when she does get back on them because , once again , the smaller buck is standing in a more open spot . I 'm worried that she 'll rush the shot and miss or , worse , wound the buck and then we 'll be in for a nighttime tracking job to find him before the coyotes do . Finally Alyssa says she can see the buck . I 'm hoping it 's the right one . I 'm hoping he 's standing broadside and still with his head down grazing so she does n't get transfixed by the antlers . Bruce tells her to shoot now but she does n't . I know she does n't have a very solid platform , my coat and her shoulder , her body sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by now . The longer she waits , the less confident I am that it will happen the way it ought to . After an eternity , during which I stay mum , prone , and praying , there comes the sharp , loud crack of the rifle . I had forgotten about the muzzle brake to reduce recoil on a girl 's shoulder . Bruce explodes upward like a rocket . " You got him ! You got him ! " I rise in time to see the buck stagger and collapse . Bruce has lifted Alyssa and is hugging her . Then he hugs me . Then I hug Alyssa . Her dad and Erika , who 've crept closer behind us , are shouting and coming up . " Run over there and make sure he 's done , " Bruce tells me . " I 'll bring Alyssa . " I take off , my own legs scarcely obeying me after being stuck so long in one position . The buck is lying dead with his eyes open and a small hole in the middle of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect shot , the diagram any hunter has seen countless times of where to shoot a deer . The buck has a dark , forked 4x4 rack and is enormous , bigger than any whitetail I 've ever seen , girthed up from months of feeding in anticipation of the rut . Alyssa swings her way over to pose for photos and get congratulatory first , second , and third hugs from everybody . The men , all three of us , are now looking away , drying the tears we would swear are just from the wind in our eyes . Bruce begins gutting the animal and has Alyssa take part , both their hands on his heavy knife as they slice up the belly . He removes the heart and hoists it for us to see . The top of it has been pulverized by the shot . " Ca n't shoot them any better'n this , " he says . Alyssa strokes the flank of the buck quietly . That night , after a celebratory dinner in Bruce 's camper trailer , he prints out some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed copies of Alyssa and Bruce together . She has her hands on the buck 's antlers , striped in their own shadows by the slanting sun , the wind pushing both ends of Bruce 's long mustache toward Alyssa . Alyssa signs all of hers with her name and " the deer slayer . " I tell her I ca n't get over the shot , that it is almost unbelievable . " Tell you something else , " says Bruce . " It was actually 223 yards . I told her 200 because I did n't want her to overthink it or hold high or anything like that . " I look at her and blurt , " You could n't make that shot twice . " I do n't know why I say this , and even as the words come out of my mouth , I know they 're stupid and just hope that she does n't take offense . But the luminous girl with two earrings in her right ear and the Vermeer skin just regards me with that look , at once open and impenetrable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot again . " She says this neither in irritation nor as a boast . It is just the truth , a thing that she knows . And she has never found there to be any great virtue in hiding the truth . It is at this moment that I see the steel beneath the beauty . Suddenly I understand . This is a girl who can not be defeated , even if she should die in the fight . Of course she could make that same shot tomorrow . She could absolutely make that shot . BOX WHAT YOU CAN DO Want to help kids like Alyssa take their own dream hunting or fishing trip ? Tina Pattison , founder and president of the nonprofit Hunt of a Lifetime organization ( 866-345-4455 ; huntofalifetime.org ) , says there are many ways to get involved , and they do n't all require writing a check .
