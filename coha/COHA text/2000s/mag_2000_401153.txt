Section : CLINIC Winning is the only thing when you 're faced with a serious health problem . Here 's how some top ballplayers fought their way off the DL  --  and how you can , too TABLE <p> Condition : Colorectal cancer <p> Davis 's fist-size tumor was discovered after he went to the doctor complaining of severe abdominal pain . He returned to baseball 6 weeks after having his tumor removed , continued playing while he underwent chemotherapy , and later that year had his longest career hitting streak . <p> " Cancer beats you up mentally and physically , but you can recover without any loss of stamina or strength , " Davis says . " Cancer is n't the end of what you love to do . " <p> What you should do : Once a year , check your stool for hidden blood using an at-home kit from your doctor or pharmacist . Beginning at age 50 , schedule a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy and a digitalrectal exam ( DRE ) . Each year , 63,600 men are diagnosed with colorectal cancer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American males get timely colon screenings . More than half of colorectal-cancer deaths in the United States could be prevented through timely screenings . <p> Davis also overcame a lacerated liver , which he suffered making a diving catch in the 1990 World Series . TABLE <p> Condition : Oral cancer <p> Brett Butler thought he was going in for a routine tonsillectomy , but when he came out of surgery , he was told that doctors had found a plum-size malignant tumor . He then had to have surgery to remove the mass along with 50 lymph nodes . <p> " I chewed tobacco for 3 years because it was part of the environment I was in  --  the guys I knew did it . Cases like mine should give people the motivation and courage to stay away from harmful habits . " <p> What you should do : Watch out for these early signs : a thickening inside the cheek , difficulty chewing and swallowing , and mouth sores that do n't heal . Giving up tobacco and cutting back to moderate drinking can all but eliminate your risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims 5,000 lives each year . Only 10 percent of oral cancers affect people under the age of 40 . More than 50 percent of oral cancers are not diagnosed until they 're in the advanced stages . Butler 's habit of chewing tobacco raised his risk of oral cancer by 400 percent . TABLE <p> Condition : Glaucoma <p> Kirby Puckett woke up one morning to find his vision marred by a black dot in his right eye . Thinking he 'd poked it accidentally while sleeping , he was n't concerned . But by the end of the day , his vision was seriously impaired . The diagnosis : end-stage glaucoma , an eye disease that attacks without warning . Doctors performed several laser eye surgeries on Puckett , but it was too late . Now legally blind in his right eye , Puckett will never play professional ball again . <p> " When I think that this all could have been prevented by a routine test , I feel obligated to speak out . People hardly ever go to an optometrist for routine checks . " <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems , get an eye exam every 3 years after age 40 , every other year after 50 . Glaucoma is the second leading cause of vision loss in the world . Three million Americans have it . About 120,000 Americans are now blind because of the disease . Half of glaucoma sufferers are unaware they have it . With no warning , Puckett 's vision in his right eye deteriorated from 20/20 to 20/200 . TABLE <p> Condition : Non-Hodgkinslymphoma ( NHL ) <p> Andres Galarraga returned to baseball this spring after spending last season undergoing both chemotherapy and radiation therapy to eradicate lymphoma in his lower back . Since his cancer was caught and treated before it had a chance to spread , his chances for a full recovery are better than 90 percent . <p> " When they told me I had cancer , I felt like I 'd be dying the next day . I 've always been the big , strong guy who worked hard to stay in shape . The fact is , working out and being in good shape do n't necessarily protect you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Most people with NHL have no known risk factors , and there 's no way to prevent the disease . Some signs that will help you catch it early include unexplained weight loss , profuse sweating , and chronically swollen lymph nodes . More than 31,700 men are affected by NHL , a cancer of the immune-system cells that fight infection . NHL kills 13,700 men each year . If it 's caught early , before it spreads , chances of survival are 70 percent . <p> Galarraga 's comeback is more amazing considering that , at age 39 , he is the oldest first baseman in the National League . TABLE <p> Condition : Epilepsy <p> Lazzeri played his entire 14-year career ( 1926-1939 ) with epilepsy and never had an episode during a game . He may have taken phenobarbital , an early antiseizure medication . Today , surgery and a number of new medications are also used to treat epilepsy . Eighty-five percent of epileptics are treated successfully and are able to lead normal lives . <p> What you should do : If you 've experienced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An estimated 2 million people in the United States have epilepsy . Seventy percent of the cases have no known cause . Every year , 180,000 new cases are diagnosed . <p> A hundred years ago , epilepsy was seen as a psychiatric disorder . TABLE <p> Condition : Herniated disk <p> If you do n't treat a herniated disk , the surrounding muscles can weaken and shrink , which will lead to further ruptures higher up in the spine . The quick , sharp movements an athlete  --  or a father-must make daily can cause the injury , especially if previous damage or inactivity has weakened the area . After surgery , Dunston went through almost 2 years of rehabilitation before returning to baseball . <p> " If it had happened during the season , I might have tried to play through the pain and injured it worse , " Dunston says . " 1 learned that sometimes you have to step away today to make sure you can play tomorrow . " <p> What you should do : The best ways to protect your back are to stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and be careful when lifting heavy objects . Every year , 90,000 men between the ages of 15 and 44 visit hospitals because of disk problems . Ninety percent of cases are treated successfully with rest and physical therapy . Herniated disks are most common in people in their 30s and 40s . <p> Dunston hurt his back in the off-season while lifting his baby daughter out of her car seat . TABLE <p> Condition : Testicular cancer <p> Lowell 's cancer came as a complete surprise ; even in the later stages of the disease , there may be no symptoms . Lowell had surgery to remove his cancerous testicle , followed by radiation therapy . Though the radiation reduced his sperm count , within 2 years it should be back to normal . Thanks to early detection , Lowell 's chances of survival are 97 percent . <p> " Sure , I have a different perspective , but that does n't mean I live each day in a dreamy state of thankfulness . No pitcher 's going to feel sorry for me or take it easy on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just fly by me . " <p> What you should do : Soap up your testicles once a month in the shower and roll them between your index finger and thumb , looking for lumps , hard spots , or painful areas . Each year , 6,900 American men are diagnosed with the disease , and 300 die . Men often find out they have testicular cancer after injuring their testicles and having them examined by a doctor , or when doing a self-exam because of pain in the lower abdomen . <p> Lowell 's cancer was found during the dreaded " turn your head and cough " exam . TABLE <p> Condition : Melanoma <p> When a mole changed color , Daulton told the team doctor ; the spot was biopsied , and 2 days later test results came back positive . Daulton had the mole removed . Thanks to early detection , no follow-up treatments are needed , and his chances for recovery are nearly I00 percent . <p> " As a ballplayer , I 'm out in the sun a lot . But since I was n't at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a shirt on , I did n't think sunscreen was necessary . Now I realize that anyone who spends a lot of time outdoors needs to protect himself by using sunscreen . " <p> What you should do : Apply sunscreen to all exposed areas before outdoor activities . Also get a skin examination every 3 years before age 40 and yearly after that . Melanoma accounts for about 4 percent of skin-cancer cases , but causes about 79 percent of skin-cancer deaths . Every year , 8,000 people will die of this cancer . <p> Daulton learned that you can get melanoma even in places you rarely expose to the sun . TABLE <p> Condition : Soft-tissue sarcoma <p> Dravecky 's living depended on his left arm , so when he noticed a small , painless bump just below his shoulder , he did n't take it lightly . Neither did the doctors . They found a sarcoma and removed it , along with half of his deltoid muscle . He made a brief comeback , but when the disease returned 2 months later , he had to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90 percent chance of survival . <p> " Sometimes you have to give up things that are important to you , " he says . " My arm was what people cheered me for ; it 's what made me valuable . It was very hard , but you adjust and you focus on the blessings that remain . " <p> What you should do : Discuss genetic testing with your doctor if you have a family history of sarcoma . Every year , 2,200 men will die of soft-tissue sarcomas , and 4,300 more will be diagnosed with the disease . Most sarcomas are inherited ; genetics is the major risk factor for the condition . Amputations are done only 5 percent of the time . <p> During his comeback , Dravecky snapped the humerus bone in his arm while pitching against Montreal . TABLE Condition : Aneurysm <p> The blockage in Cone 's arm was diagnosed after he complained of numbness in his fingers . Only 33 , he did n't have any known risk factors , such as high blood pressure or a smoking habit . Cone 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctors believe this allowed the affected area to heal more quickly . <p> " It 's kind of shocking at a young age to have to deal with something that not only could affect your athletic career , but could kill you . It 's amazing to me , though , what they can do to heal you . I 'm as good as I ever was . " In May , Cone counseled San Diego pitcher Woody Williams , who had surgery to repair an aneurysm under his right armpit . <p> What you should do : If you are over 55 , have high blood pressure , or have a family history of aneurysms , talk to your doctor about an annual screening . This will involve ultrasound , an MRI scan , or an x-ray , depending on the area being checked . An aneurysm is the ballooning of a weakened artery wall . Fifteen thousand people die of untreated aneurysms each year . <p> The physical stress of throwing a baseball for 30 years was most likely responsible for Cone 's aneurysm . TABLE <p> Condition : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in alcoholism , Eckersley attributes his drinking to the peer acceptance that came with it . He functioned normally for 10 years despite his condition , but then sought help at age 33 . After recovery , he pitched another 10 years and all but ensured his entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame . <p> " I do n't blame baseball for my drinking , because I was an alcoholic . But the baseball life made it worse . You drink to celebrate or to drown your sorrows . That was me to the max . I 'm lucky my whole life did n't fall apart . I could have lost my wife , my career , everything . Instead , I finally started to grow up . " <p> What you should do : Watch out for the early warning signs of alcoholism , such as a strong need to drink , an inability to stop , and increased tolerance of alcohol . <p> Eckersley was only 20 when he joined the Cleveland Indians and began drinking heavily . More than 7 million men in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths annually . Thirty percent of traffic fatalities are alcohol-related . TABLE <p> Condition : Prostate cancer <p> Torre 's cancer was discovered through a routine DEE during his yearly physical . Without this check , the cancer might have gone undetected because he had no symptoms . ( Prostate cancer is most common in men over 65 . Other risk factors include family history and a diet high in animal fat . ) Torre underwent surgery to remove his prostate gland , as well as radiation . <p> " At first , I did n't know if I cared enough to keep managing . But when I stepped on the field , I realized the passion was still there . I discovered how important coming back was to my recovery . " <p> What you should do : If you are over 50 , talk to your doctor about getting tested once a year . Prostate cancer is the second-most-common type of cancer among men . About 180,000 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed this year , and 32,000 men will die of the disease .
