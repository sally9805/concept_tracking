Chapter One I saw a lot of fires when I was a cop in Detroit . I was supposed to help secure the scene and then get the hell out of the way , but sometimes I 'd stick around and watch the firefighters doing their work . I saw some real battles , but when they were done , the building would always be standing . That was the thing that got to me . The windows would be blown out , and maybe there 'd be a big hole in the roof , but the building would still be there . Years later , I watched a Lake Superior storm taking down a boathouse . When the storm let up , there was nothing left but a concrete slab covered with sand . It was n't surprising . Anyone who lives up here knows that water is stronger than fire . Water wins that one going away . But at least water cleans up after itself . It does the job all the way . When water destroys , it makes everything look new . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a fire is done , what 's left is only half destroyed . It is charred and brittle . It is obscene . There is nothing so ugly in all the world as what a fire leaves behind , covered in ashes and smoke and a smell you 'll think about every day for the rest of your life . That 's why I had to start rebuilding the cabin . Maybe I was fooling myself , but it was something I had to do . Even though the days were getting shorter . Even though the pine trees were bending in the cold October wind . No man in his right mind would have started rebuilding then . So of course I did . I had already taken away most of the old wood , those logs that would have lasted another three hundred years if they had n't burned . I had hauled them away along with the pipes burned black and the bed frames twisted by the heat . There was nothing now but the stone foundation , stripped of the wooden floor , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bare hands before he died . I knew that the snow would come , and it would cover the black stains on the ground , and the chimney would stand alone in the cold silence like a grave marker . I was n't going to let that happen . The rebuilding did n't start well . The man who said he 'd be there on Monday with my white pine logs rolled up on Wednesday morning , acting like he had nothing to apologize for . He had one of those long flatbeds with a crane on it , with enough lifting power to set every last log down as gently as a teacup . But it took him all morning to clear the truck , and he damn near knocked over the chimney in the process . Then he stood around for a while , trying to tell me about his own cabin down in Traverse City . " The cabins I passed on the way in , " he finally said . " You built those ? " " My father did . " " Looks like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hitched his pants up as he looked around the clearing . " What happened ? Did it burn down ? " " It did . " " Hell of a thing , " he said . " You got ta be careful with those wood stoves . " " I ca n't argue with that . " " Looks like you learned the hard way . " I let a few seconds tick by . " It was n't a wood stove , " I finally said . " Somebody burned it down . " " You 're shittin ' me . " " This gentleman and I , we had a little disagreement . " It took a moment for that one to sink in . " Are you shittin ' me , man ? You got ta be shittin ' me . " " You do n't have to believe it . " " I suppose you 're gon na rebuild this all by yourself , too . " " I 'm gon na try . " " Seriously , where 's all your help at ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It 's October , " he said . " You 're not thinking of starting this now , are you ? " " I 'd have to be crazy , you mean . " " Is what I 'm saying , yeah . Unless you 're just shittin ' me some more . " " Well , I appreciate your concern , " I said . " And I appreciate you bringing up my logs . You were only two days late . Have a good trip back home . " He was still shaking his head as he drove away . I listened to the distant sound of his truck as he rumbled onto the main road and headed south . When he was gone , there was nothing left to hear but a steady wind coming off the lake . " Well , Pops , " I said to the wind , " let 's see if I remember how to do this . " This was the cabin he had built in the summers of 1980 and 1981 . I helped him for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of baseball and working as a police officer in Detroit , and this was my last attempt to make peace with him . The days were hot . I remember that . And as I helped him peel and scribe the logs , it brought back yet another summer , back in 1968 , the first time I had ever been up here in Paradise , Michigan . I was only seventeen then , with one more year of school ahead of me before heading off to single-A ball in Sarasota . He wanted me to go to college , but I had my own ideas . Thirteen years later , he finished this cabin , his biggest and best . His masterpiece . Six months after that he was dead . The cabin may have burned to the ground , but at least we had those summers . Twenty years later , on a cold October day , I started all over again . I cut the sill logs first , the logs that would run along the bottom of each wall , then secured them to the foundation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge with the chain saw , just as he had taught me . When it rained , the water would collect in the groove and drip away instead of running down the foundation . Then I cut the grooves for the floor joists . I put rough plywood down for the time being-I 'd put the nice hardwood floorboards down when the outside was finished . That was the first day . When the light was gone , I went down to the Glasgow Inn for dinner . My friend Jackie owns the place . If you ever find yourself in Paradise , just go to the one blinking light in the center of town , then go north another hundred yards or so . It 'll be there on the right . When you step into the place , you wo n't see a typical American bar-there are no mirrors to stare into while you drink , no smoky dark corners to nurse a bad mood in . The chairs are comfortable , there 's a fire going in the hearth every night , regardless of the weather , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an old Scottish golf caddie . If you ask him the right way , Jackie will even risk his liquor license and give you a cold Canadian beer . I take that last part back . Those Canadian beers are just for me . I felt like hell the next morning . My hands were sore , my arms were sore , my legs were sore , and my back was sore . Aside from that I was fine . I had my coffee and looked up at the dark clouds . Rain was the last thing I needed , because today was the day I 'd start building the walls . I scribed each log the way my father had done . I did most of the heavy cutting with the chain saw , stopping every half hour to sharpen it . I used an ax to cut the notches , keeping both hands together as I swung it , like a baseball bat . That much he did n't have to teach me . You ca n't be accurate with your hands apart . Of course , cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the old man liked to say , this is where you separated the men from the boys . The idea is to cut it so perfectly that one log will rest on top of the other with no daylight in between . If you do it right , you do n't need any chinking . If you do n't do it right , then God help you . You 've got no business building a cabin in the first place . The first log I tried cutting that morning , I did n't get right . The second log was worse . The third log you could have put in a carnival and charged people five dollars a head to come laugh at it . The wind picked up . It looked like rain was coming . I kept working . I was halfway through the fourth log when the hornets attacked me . The nest was hanging from one of the birch trees . They had already been smoked out the night of the fire , the nest partially caved in by the spray of the fire hoses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they had run out of time . Now half-crazed by the cold weather , most of them near the end of their natural lives , they saw me moving around below them , rattling around with my chain saw . They decided to go down fighting . I slapped two off the back of my neck , another off my arm . " Crazy fucking things ! Get away from me ! " The next one caught me right on the cheek and that was it for me . The day was already going bad enough . I had my extension ladder there , figuring I 'd need it eventually , so I braced it up against the birch tree and climbed up with my ax . I was just about to swing at the branch . I was going to take the whole thing down with one good whack , and then I was going to soak the nest with gasoline and set it on fire . Knowing me , I would have emptied the can , a full two gallons of gasoline , and then I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . All the leaves on the ground would have gone up at once and I 'd be running around with my pants on fire and both eyebrows singed right off my face . I stopped myself just in time . I took a deep breath and climbed back down the ladder . I dropped the ax . It was n't worth it . Watching the nest burn , sending the rest of those hornets to hell . They 'd all be dead in another week , anyway . It was a lesson I had taken most of my life to learn . Sometimes you have to let things go . The rain came . The dark clouds stayed in the sky . I went back to work . I had come back up here in 1987 . My marriage was over and I was off the police force , with a dead partner in the ground and a bullet in my chest . I came up here intending to sell off the land and the six cabins my father had built , but I did n't do it . Somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cold and unforgiving , even in the heart of summer . There was a terrible beauty to the place , and I could be alone up here in a part of the world where being alone was the rule and not the exception . I moved into the first cabin , the cabin I had helped him build myself , back when I was seventeen years old . I stayed up here and lived day to day and never thought I 'd have to face my past again . That did n't work . It never does . Hours after I called it a day , I could still feel the buzz of the chain saw in my hands . There was a deep ache in my shoulder , right where they had taken the other two bullets out . " What was it this time ? " Jackie said . He slid a cold Canadian my way . He was talking about my face , of course . There was a nice little swollen knot under my eye . Whenever something goes wrong , I end up wearing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How 's the cabin going ? " " It 's a little slow . " He nodded his head . He did n't say a word about how late it was in the season or how much of a fool I was . Jackie understood why I needed to do this . " You know who could help you , " he said . I knew . I took a long pull off the bottle and then set it back down on the bar . " I 've got to get some sleep , " I said . Then I left . I was just as sore the next morning , but somehow everything felt different . It was all coming back to me , the way you let the chain saw and the ax do the work , the way you work with the grain of the log instead of fighting against it . The logs started fitting together the way they were supposed to . I had the walls two logs high by lunchtime . Of course , that meant it was getting harder and harder to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start using the ramps soon , and eventually I 'd have to set up some kind of skyline . That would slow me down . Hell , maybe Jackie was right . There was one man who could really help me . But I 'd be damned if I was going to go ask him . My father bad bought all the land on both sides of this old logging road , nearly a hundred acres in all . He built the six cabins and lived in each one of them off and on over the years , renting out the others to tourists in the summer , hunters in the fall , and snow-mobilers in the winter . When I came up here and moved into the first cabin , I kept renting out the rest of them . It was a good way to stay busy without having to go anywhere . A few years after I moved in , somebody bought the couple of acres between my father 's land and the main road . I was a little worried about what the new owner might do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , with every tree knocked down so they could maybe get a view of the lake . But it did n't happen that way . It was one man , and I watched him build his own cabin by hand . If my father had been around to see it , he would have approved of this man 's work . I got to know him eventually . You do n't live on the same road up here with one other person without running into each other . I 'd plow the road for him . He 'd give me some of the venison from his hunts . He did n't drink , so we never did that together , but we did share an adventure or two . I even played in goal one night for his hockey team . The fact that he was an Ojibwa Indian never got in the way of our friendship . Until one day he had to make a choice . I did n't hear his truck pull up . With the chain saw roaring away , I would n't have heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw his truck parked there . Vinnie Red Sky LeBlanc was standing next to it , watching me . He was wearing his denim jacket with the fur around the collar . I had no idea how long he 'd been there . I shut the chain saw down and wiped my forehead with my sleeve . " You 're gon na go deaf , " he said . " Where 's your ear protection ? " " I left them around here someplace . Just ca n't find them . " He shook his head at that , then walked right past me to the stacks of logs . Like many Bay Mills Ojibwa , you had to look twice to see the Indian in him . There was a little extra width to his high cheekbones , and a certain calmness in his eyes when he looked at you . You always got the feeling he was thinking carefully about what to say before he said it . " White pine , " he said . " Of course . " " Where 'd it come from ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought I saw a truck going by , " he said . " That was what , Wednesday ? " " He was supposed to be here Monday . " " Couple of these logs I would n't use on a doghouse , " he said . " Like this one right here . " " I know . I was gon na put that one aside . " He slipped his hands under the log and lifted it . He was maybe three inches shorter than me , and thirty pounds lighter , but I would n't have wanted to fight the man , on the ice or off . He carried the log a few steps and tossed it in the brush . " That 'll be your waste pile , " he said . " I see another one right down here . " " You do n't have to do that , Vinnie . I know which ones are bad . " He went over to the cabin , knelt down , and ran his hand along one of the logs . " You know which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet this one right here seems to be part of your wall already . " " When did you become the county inspector ? " I said . " I did n't see it in the newspaper . " Continues ...
