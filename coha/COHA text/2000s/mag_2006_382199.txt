Starbucks fancies itself a small company , which might ring a little odd , considering that the coffee giant is regularly parodied as being practically unavoidable . Well , the joke is only going to get funnier as the Seattle firm , with its shareholders clearly in mind , gets even bigger , selling more stuff , from hot food to hot music , in more places than ever before . Right now Big Green runs 12,440 locations worldwide , but the goal is 40,000 , which would trump even McDonald 's . <P> But McDonald 's does n't try to behave like a chain of boutiques , and that 's where the tension inside Starbucks lies . " The battle within the company is making sure growth does n't dilute our culture , " says founder and chairman Howard Schultz . In the Starbucks ethos , the best authority is decentralized , and the best decisions are made store by store . The company stays clear of focus groups , acts on its instincts and does n't open franchises for fear of losing control . Schultz decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in stores because , he says , " it felt right . " If he or another senior exec does n't like a new drink concoction , it does n't get sold . How 's that for research ?
