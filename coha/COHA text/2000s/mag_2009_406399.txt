Goldman Sachs 's Dina Habib Powell helps women in business learn  --  and lead . WHO COULD have guessed ? For nearly eighty years , Freud 's famously exasperated query  --  " What do women want ? "  --  dismissed the female character . Mercurial creatures , women clearly could not invest in or pursue success the way men defined it . At best , they were baffling . At worst , well , you 've heard that story . But hold the phone . Photograph : Dina Habib Powell ( right ) oversees the Goldman Sachs program , which partners with such groups as Women for Women , founded by Zainab Salbi ( left ) . No less a male bastion than New York-based financial-services firm Goldman Sachs is taking on the everlasting question and providing answers . A year ago , at a mediagenic event at Columbia Business School , in Manhattan , company chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein announced an unparalleled $100 million investment in women , betting on them as an important economic engine for the 21st century . " This is not where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open space , " says Dina Habib Powell , who had been tapped by Goldman in 2007 to lead the mission . " We believe that women , once empowered in every country , including the U.S. , will have a tremendous impact on society , on the economy and on the next generation . " Called 10,000 Women ( 10000women.org ) , the five-year program aims to join with academic institutions and nongovernmental organizations  --  like Zainab Salbi 's Women for Women International ( womenforwomen.org )  --  to provide 10,000 underserved women from Beijing to Bangalore , from So Paulo to Oakland , with educations in business . Although the United Nations and the World Bank have long backed similar efforts , this is the first such large-scale private undertaking , and it is underwritten by a world-class investor , too . " It 's one thing for women activists to say that women are the future , " says the Iraqi-born Salbi , whose organization , founded in 1993 , helps women war survivors and is a key on-the-ground partner with 10,000 Women . " But it 's quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company at the heart of the financial market to say , ' You have to invest in women . ' It 's a turning point in history . " The initiative , which debuted in Lagos , Nigeria , last May , targets female entrepreneurs stuck in low gear . They 're running businesses but lack the resources or know-how to grow . " Someone with passion and drive , " explains Powell , " but also a woman who already has an existing business with employees . We believe that 's the real opportunity for a multiplier effect . " In each locale , a collaborating university selects the women , teaching them how to draft business plans , how to secure capital and how to develop effective skills in marketing , accounting , management and more . During the program and after graduation , volunteers from Goldman provide mentoring via e-mail and phone and sometimes in person . Last September , 600 women applied for Rwanda 's first sixty slots . Says Salbi : " On the global issues , the initiative of leadership is crucial . A land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now has a parliament that 's 56 percent women . It happened because the leadership understood there was no way to rebuild without the full engagement of women . " Wearing a tailored black pantsuit , with the collar of a peach blouse overflowing the lapels , big Kenneth Jay Lane-like faux pearls and  --  her only apparent indulgence  --  stiletto patent pumps , Powell is well into the project that has her traveling frequently . Yet she looks comfortably settled into her modest office high above Lower Manhattan at Goldman 's 85 Broad Street headquarters . At age thirty-five , married to Richard C. Powell Jr. , chief operating officer of the international public-relations firm Burson-Marsteller , and with two young daughters , seven and three , Powell has still managed to rack up an impressive rsum in the Bush administration over the past decade . " I do n't have a glamorous story , " she says , backpedaling from compliments . Her family emigrated from Egypt when she was young , and she grew up in Texas . After graduating from the University of Texas at Austin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick Armey , who was then House majority leader . Next came a stint in the White House as chief of personnel under President Bush and positions as assistant secretary and deputy secretary at the State Department , working with undersecretary Karen Hughes and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to promote global dialogue through cultural and academic programs . While at the State Department , Powell found that the programs that worked with women around the world were among the most successful . She began an affiliation with Vital Voices Global Partnership ( vitalvoices.org ) , a nonprofit founded in 1997 by First Lady Hillary Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that supports women community leaders . Although she loved her job at the State Department , when the call came to form a new philanthropic initiative targeting women , she could n't walk away . " It 's very powerful when Goldman Sachs comes out and says , ' We found our best investment for the future , ' " says Powell , with a grin . " I was sold . "       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
