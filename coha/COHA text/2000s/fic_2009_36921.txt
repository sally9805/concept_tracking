The call for help came late at night . They usually did . <p> Only this one was the worst kind . A child . Lost in the unforgiving Colorado mountains . <p> Melody Crawford replaced the receiver and rolled out of the bed , shoving her feet into heavy boots as she pushed to stand . She 'd been asleep less than thirty minutes . <p> Within another ten minutes , she was wide-awake , dressed for the frigid temperatures and rummaging in her " rescue closet " for the equipment she might need on the snow-covered trail . In more than fifteen years of rescue work , she 'd never stopped feeling the adrenaline rush that came with a call . <p> Backpack always loaded and ready , she reached for her dog 's leash and vest and heard the soft pad of canine footsteps crossing the kitchen and coming toward her in the narrow hallway . <p> It was Ace . <p> A little piece of her heart broke off . <p> Smile wide , thick fur fluffed and ready with one hard shake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazed up at her in question . As always , Ace was ready to work , ready to run , ready to rescue the lost . <p> " Sorry , old chum , " she said , laying one hand on the wide , intelligent head . " Not tonight . " <p> Not any night in the near future , although Ace was the best air-scent search and rescue dog she 'd ever trained . <p> As if he understood , the dog whined softly and collapsed at her feet to stare up at her with sad eyes . <p> " As soon as I get the money , boy . We 'll have you fixed up and good as new . " <p> But money , for Melody , was hard to come by . Even by training and boarding other people 's dogs , her income was limited . The monthly check from her father 's insurance barely covered necessities , and the surgery to correct Ace 's damaged hind knees was expensive , far over her budget . But he 'd sustained the injuries in the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somehow , even if she had to take an outside job , she 'd find a way to help her partner and friend . <p> The idea of working at a regular job made her shudder . Not that she was lazy . She worked long and hard up here in her secluded section of the mountains . It was n't work that bothered her . It was people . <p> " Chili , " she called softly and was not surprised to find the affable , reddish-brown Lab waiting quietly in the doorway behind her . Trained to search by air and ground , Chili was an excellent rescue dog who loved kids . With a little luck and by moving quickly , he had the best chance of finding the missing child . <p> With regrets to the depressed Ace , she snapped Chili into his bright orange rescue vest and , flashlight in hand , headed for her truck . <p> One step outside and she burrowed deeper into the muffler around her neck , thinking of the search to come . <p> The night was still as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid was well dressed or found shelter , he was in serious trouble . The colder he became , the less scent he gave off . Without scent particles floating into Chili 's incredible olfactory glands , the dog could n't do his job . <p> The knowledge spurred Melody to work faster . If anyone could find the boy , she and Chili could do it . They were the best in the mountains . Maybe the best in the country . They never quit until the victim was found  --  alive or dead . She preferred alive . <p> As she passed the snug kennels , the rest of the dogs , all boarders in training , slipped out of their houses to stretch and shake beneath the white moon . Silver vapor puffed around their wide , sturdy heads . Like Ace , none of them would make the trip tonight . They were n't her dogs . They were brought to her by folks too busy or disinclined to do their own initial obedience training . Melody did n't mind . Working with dogs , anyone 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ace and Chili , on the other hand , were her babies , her children , her family . She took care of them and they took care of her . Together , they did n't need anyone else , but a lot of people needed them . Occasionally . And when the need was met , people faded away from her wilderness cabin like the foggy vapor faded into the night . <p> People . <p> She touched the barely visible scar at her hairline . <p> Not her favorite species . <p> Intentionally , she turned her thoughts to the little boy lost somewhere beneath the flat white moon . He would be scared . Scared of the black , inky darkness . Scared of the night cries of wolf and owl . Scared even of the bare aspen limbs rubbing together like dead bones . <p> Kids were a different matter . She did n't consider them people yet . They did n't have prejudices and ulterior motives . They were at the mercy of adults , just as she 'd been . <p> But no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of her life , which did not include people most of the time . Thank God and Grandma Perkins , who 'd left her this remote cabin more than sixteen years ago when life had been hell . <p> She opened the truck door and waited for Chili to leap easily into the passenger side , ready for the trip to a ranger station four miles down the mountain . As she climbed in behind her dog and cranked the engine , Melody wondered why she 'd awakened tonight with the old memories so sharp . <p> But memories were okay , occasionally . They kept her focused , kept her mindful of why she 'd never permanently leave this mountain again . <p> John North paced the command center he 'd set up inside the ranger station near the small community of Glass Creek . Slowly , too slowly for his liking , the emergency personnel began to trickle in , waiting for their assignments . He tossed back the last dregs in his coffee cup , grimacing at the bitter taste . <p> As the new director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to do this first search right  --  and every search hereafter . Lives , as well as his livelihood , depended upon his exceptional training and expertise . <p> " How far away is that dog team ? " he asked Brent Page , the county sheriff , who stood to one side chewing the end of a toothpick . John could see the man was aching for a cigarette but would n't give in while on duty . <p> " She 'll be here . " <p> He figured that . He 'd called the woman , had n't he ? And he distinctly remembered the soft , feminine sound of a voice still drenched in sleep . <p> As director , coordinating all the necessary team members was part of his job , right down to making the phone calls . As soon as all the emergency services were assembled , they could begin . <p> For the distraught parents , huddled with a female forest ranger at a small round table , the moment could n't come too soon . <p> John laid out the topographical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the missing child . <p> Outside the station , truck motors roared and doors slammed . Voices carried on the still , thin air . A couple of park rangers came in followed by a slight woman with a happy-looking , red dog . <p> For John North time stopped . He stared at the woman . Bundled for the cold , she wore a bright yellow-and-blue ski suit and hooded parka . From within the frame of sheepskin she looked out over the assembled group , assessing , cautious , almost angry . She was both fearsome and fascinating , and John experienced a most unusual reaction . Interest . Attraction . He , who had sworn off women five years ago , was mesmerized . <p> The newcomer 's face was delicate and pretty , though devoid of makeup . Her full lower lip looked soft and sensitive , kissable even , though he cursed himself for noticing at a time like this . But her eyes fascinated him the most . Pale , pale silver with edges of gold , her eyes were the strangest he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but something he saw in their depths , some deep and frightening knowledge . He 'd seen that look before but he could n't place where . <p> This must be the search and rescue team or " dog woman " as the other emergency personnel called her . <p> Shaking off the odd sensation that had gripped him the moment she walked into the station , John stepped forward . " I 'm John North , director of operations . " <p> He offered a hand . She did n't take it . If anything , she shrunk back , placing her palm on the dog at her side . <p> With those disturbing eyes , she quietly looked him over , and John was sure , found him woefully wanting . <p> " Melody Crawford , " she said shortly . " This is Chili . Let 's get started . Give me some details . " <p> So much for introductions . <p> " The boy is ten . He and his father were hiking . Somehow they got separated . " <p> " When ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the map spread out on a table next to the coffeepot , a telephone and a handheld radio . " Here . " <p> He was acutely aware of the woman as she leaned forward and took note of the area . Her scent , as she leaned in , was a mix of cold air , warm woman and peppermint . She said nothing , only studied the map with the kind of intensity he 'd witnessed during his many years as an Army Ranger . <p> Leaving her to the task , he began to disseminate duties to the various gathered personnel , all bearing maps and compasses and other search gear . The rangers and police officers would walk grids or drive the roads , hoping the boy would find his way out of the wilderness and onto a road . Others would ride snowmobiles or ATVs as far into the area as possible . <p> No other dog teams could be here anytime soon and time was too critical to wait . They 'd have to go with this one woman and her Lab and pray that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to get started . " He turned to Melody , who now waited quietly , while her canine made the rounds of the station , receiving pats and shaking hands . John found it especially interesting that the others present knew and liked her dog , but not one had spoken to the trainer . " You 'll take the direct trail , following this grid . " <p> " The map is inaccurate . " <p> " What ? " <p> " I 'll follow the direct trail from where the boy was last seen , but this grid is off by at least a quarter of a mile . " <p> " Great . Just great . " Frustration burned in John 's gut . Ever since taking this new position , he 'd run into the same problem over and over again . All the data , the maps , the grids , the disaster plans were outdated . Coordinated out of the County Sheriff 's office for years , emergency management was woefully lacking . That was why the mayor and governor had developed this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John had far more work to do than he 'd imagined . And less time to do it . The governor had given him a year to prove the department was worth the extra funding . <p> " Do you know the area ? " <p> Again that cool , cool stare from those bizarre eyes . " Of course . Does the family have any item that belonged to the boy ? An item which has n't been contaminated ? " <p> " Is that necessary ? " He 'd always heard that SAR dogs could work without prescenting . <p> " No . But a scent helps get Chili moving much faster . And in case you have n't noticed , time is not on our side . " <p> Though the comment bordered on sarcasm , she was right . The temperatures continued to fall . The boy was warmly dressed , which was a plus , but hypothermia remained a real threat . <p> " I 'll ask the family . " He made his way to the parents and returned with a stocking cap . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Strangely enough , she shrank back . " How many hands have touched it ? " <p> " Mine , the dad 's , and the boy 's . " <p> " It will have to do . " <p> Without further ado , she spoke quietly to the dog , held the inside of the cap to his twitching black nose , and then left the command post . <p> Melody 's insides trembled as she loaded Chili once more into the truck cab and climbed behind the wheel . <p> John North was military . She could see it in his precise bearing , hear it in the clipped , confident commands , feel it emanating from him in waves of danger . She knew his type . No pretty boy this . Rugged and masculine with snapping brown eyes and darker hair , John North was fit and powerful <p> And military . <p> She laid her head on the steering wheel . <p> Upon hearing that the county had finally hired a full-time emergency management director , Melody had been pleased . The sheriff had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient job . Search and rescue had taken a backseat to all the duties of a sheriff to serve and protect , a fact of life that had severely hampered rescue operations . For a while , she 'd worried they might hire Tad Clauson , a deputy who had lobbied long and hard for the development of an emergency management program within the county . While she agreed with his concept , she despised the deputy , who seemed intent on making her life miserable at every meeting . <p> But this man , this John North fellow , was far worse than Tad . He was military . He was deadly . And he scared her to pieces . <p> Chili , sensing her unease and wondering why they were n't moving whined softly and nudged at her hand as if to say , " Get moving , Mama , we have a kid to find . " <p> With a shaky laugh , she cranked the engine . " Right . Focus , huh , boy ? A lost kid is in a lot more trouble than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , and Melody changed her mind . John North slid onto the bench seat next to Chili . <p> Melody scowled , hoping to frighten him away . " What are you doing ? " <p> " I thought I 'd ride along with you , watch you work . " <p> Her pulse ratcheted up to mach speed . " Chili and I work alone . " <p> " Not this time . If I 'm going to use your services , I need to see for myself that you know what you 're doing . " <p> In the darkness , lit only by the moon and the lights of vehicles beginning to move , he looked across at her , expression mild . There was a stubbornness about him , and a confidence that bordered on cockiness . He was the boss and she 'd better get used to it . <p> She did n't like him . <p> " Suit yourself . " She cranked the engine and drove in silence . The truck could only go so far before they 'd have to hike into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been seen . When they reached the vicinity , she parked the vehicle and got out , strapped on her backpack , leashed Chili and started through the woods without a word to her uninvited guest . If Mr. High and Mighty Military Man wanted to come , he 'd better keep up . <p> He did . With little effort , he was beside her , his breath puffing gray smoke into the cold night . <p> Ignoring the man took effort , but Melody concentrated on her job with Chili . With soft commands , she unsnapped the dog , told him to search and waited while he gained his bearings . For several seconds , he stood , nose high , sorting the millions of scents that invaded his brain . <p> " What 's he doing ? " <br> Continues ...
