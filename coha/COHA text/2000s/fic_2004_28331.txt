The Inquisitor By Peter Clement Random House Peter Clement Wednesday , April 2 , 5:30 a.m . Palliative Care Unit , St. Paul 's Hospital Buffalo , New York The air on the ward hung thick with the smell of flatulence , body odor , and sweat-soaked sheets . What little light could be seen curdled in pools of shadow . The cries that rose and fell against the outside of her door might as well have been a wail of wind , because here no one would heed them . The nurses paid attention only when the moaning stopped . Somewhere someone retched with a force that must have stripped the stomach bare . The sound echoed along the hallway . That might bring them . Soon the squeak of crepe soles on linoleum would announce their approach . None came . " Store up all the tiny details . Let me smell , taste , hear , see , and touch through your telling of them . " The command , issued to me so long ago , resurfaced , resonating in memory with the freshness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disobeyed . As always before a mission , it marshaled a frame of mind fine-tuned to observe , the ideal state to be in for keeping myself and the records sharp . " Can you hear me ? " I whispered , holding back on the plunger of my syringe . " Yes . " Her eyes remained shut . I leaned over and brought my ear to her mouth . " Any more pain ? " " No . It 's gone . " " Do you see anything ? " " Only blackness . " Her whispers rasped against the back of her throat . " Look harder ! Now tell me what 's there . " I swallowed to keep from gagging . Her breath stank . " You 're not my doctor . " " No , I 'm replacing him tonight . " She did n't respond . I gave her a gentle shake . " Mrs. Algreave ? " " Just leave me be . It does n't hurt anymore . " Leaning back , I studied her gray , skeletal face . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making her appear already dead . As for the rest of her , so much had wasted away that the soft material of her lace nightgown clung to the hollows between her ribs and reminded me of white gloves on bony fingers . I glanced toward the closed door -- the nurses should n't start their rounds for another half hour yet -- and reapplied my thumb to the plunger . A slow push , and her pulse grew weaker . " Do you see anything yet ? " No answer . " Mrs. Algreave ! " " Yes ? " " Tell me what you see . " " It 's too dark . " " Look carefully . " " But I ca n't see . " " Do you sense yourself rising ? " Again no answer . I shifted my mouth closer to her ear . " Talk to me , Mrs. Algreave . " The words must have sounded like a shout . " Leave me alone . " " Not until you tell me what you see . " I gradually increased the pressure on the plunger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readable only to experienced fingertips , like Braille . It should n't be long now . Her failing circulation would abandon the lesser organs -- kidneys , ovaries , digestive tracts , large and small -- and reroute itself entirely to spare the more essential meats , the lungs , heart , and brain . A perfectly orchestrated sequence , designed to save neurons so that they could record the final seconds . Anyone bold enough could tap the knowledge hidden in those moments . " Are you looking down on us yet ? " At first I thought she had n't heard me . Then her lips moved but emitted no sound . Turning my head , I hovered an inch above her mouth . She exhaled against my cheek , sending another whiff of rot drifting through my nostrils to play at the back of my tongue . " What did you say ? " " I . . . see . . . me . . . " Her words filled my ear one breath at a time , elongated and no louder than a puff of breeze . But I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to messages from this plane . Excitement mounting , I turned on the tiny tape recorder in my breast pocket . " What else can you make out ? " " The . . . bed . . . nightstand . . . pictures . . . all my pictures . . . " On the small bedside table a silver-framed black-and-white shot of a young man in uniform stood propped behind an array of more recent , color snaps , the kind processed in an hour : a dark-haired couple , three grinning boys in front of a Christmas tree , a woman holding a baby . Only the soldier interested me . " Is that your husband ? " " Yes . . . " " What 's his name ? " I barely made out the word that followed . It sounded like " Frank . " " Is he dead ? " Her breath diminished to a point it would n't have fogged a mirror . " Yes . . . " " Do you want to find him ? " Most did . The yearning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Are you still looking down on yourself in bed ? " " Yes . . . " " Let go . Allow yourself to float , escape the hospital , go high above the building . You must do this before you can see Frank . " " Yes . . . " " Look up . " " No . . . " " Look up and you 'll see Frank . He 's waiting . " " I . . . wo n't . . . get . . . back . . . . " " Look up ! " No reply . Had I forced her too far ? No , she still had a pulse . Nevertheless , I eased off the plunger . " Can you hear me ? " " Yes . . . " " What do you see ? " " Too . . . vast . . . " " What ? Night ? Space ? Stars ? " " Gray . . . " " Gray what ? " " Cold . . . " " Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My insides tightened . " You 've got to see something . " " It 's horrible . . . " " What is ? " " Help me . . . . " Damn her , why did n't she tell me ? " Describe where you are , or I 'll leave you there . Frank wo n't ever find you . " This time I heard a sharp intake of breath . " No . . . please . . . " " Then tell me . " " Nothing . . . to . . . tell . . . " The pulse under my fingers raced stronger . Her breath blew against my ear with more force . " It 's . . . terrible . . . . Get . . . me . . . out . . . . Please . . . get me out . . . . " The faint sounds became a cry . Her eyes shot open , wide with terror . No one had ever come to before now . I clamped my palm over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nurses heard ? No footsteps approached . She looked straight at me . " You recognize me now ? " I asked , my thumb still on the plunger . She nodded and tried to say something , but the sound vibrated against my palm . It tickled . " Shh ! Do n't speak ! " I advanced the plunger . Just give her a little more , enough to subdue her again . " You 've been having a bad dream . " She shook her head and fixed her stare on where I 'd stuck the syringe through a rubber portal in her IV . Her brows shot upward and her forehead furrowed with alarm , and the squeals she made against my hand pierced the quiet . I pressed down harder . " I said quiet ! " She started to buck , making the bed squeak . Oh , God , where did she find the strength ? The others had n't . I leaned on her , pinning the emaciated form to the mattress . " I warn you , stop it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rasped out of me in a crow 's squawk . The bed rattled as she writhed under my weight . I pushed more forcefully against her mouth . Her movements continued . The iron frame began to creak in off-key squeals , the noises grating along the inside of my skull . Any minute a nurse would be sure to hear . I increased the pressure on the syringe . Flailing at me , she struck my arm , and the plunger lurched ahead , injecting the entire contents of the chamber into her IV . I gaped at the emptied cylinder in horror . She gradually stopped moving . Her pulse vanished . The respirations slowed to a standstill . Yet her brows remained raised , and she continued to glare at me , but with the flat dilated pupils of the dead . Nausea swept through me , and my heart rate bounded into triple digits . I 'd never killed one before . Just kept them in limbo as they died . Swallowing until I had no more spit , I pulled out the syringe , replaced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the covers and floor verified that nothing had been dropped or left behind . But as I bent over , the microcassette recorder slipped out of my breast pocket and clattered to the linoleum . Retrieving it , I clicked the off button . Close call . Had it hit a mat or her bedding without a sound , I might not have noticed . I steadied my breathing and , surveying the scene , satisfied myself that everything would seem natural . As I backed toward the door , the moonlight shone across her face at a low angle , filling the hollows and depressions with deep shadows . Her eyes , still open , glittered from the bottom of gaunt sockets . Despite my knowing better , I could have sworn they watched me every step of the way .
