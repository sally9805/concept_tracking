I left Haiti when I was nine years old and came to the States , but I always say that the music that I make is a reflection of what I remember from my childhood there . <P> I think it gives me a natural sense of discipline and the ability to be a hard worker . If you look on the map , Haiti is right next to Santo Domingo , and at one time it was really one place , you know ? Then you have Jamaica and Puerto Rico . I think musically all of that stuff in the Caribbean  --  the rhythm and the drums  --  you just get a natural sense of it . Sometimes , when I 'm with my friends in the studio , I start to play salsa or merengue , and they 're like , " Man , you 're playing like you 're from Puerto Rico or something ! " I do n't know how I 'm able to do that , but I know it has something to do with the Caribbean . It 's just naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the music I do . Somehow , you can always hear that little island influence . <P> I think music is the main tool for social change . I think it makes you look at a place differently . A lot of times what happens is that you only see one side of the news , you only hear one side of what 's going on , and there 's a whole other side . What music has been able to do through the years is bring awareness to people . There are problems Haiti is going through , but music is how we can help it . <P> I came up into the music scene in 1993 with a group called the Fugees . Hip-hop was the stepping-stone for what we did . I feel that hip-hop today is stronger than it 's ever been , and it 's going to keep growing . <P>  --  Reported by Alex Smith
