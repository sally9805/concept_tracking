I sought vengeance , and now I dream of forgiveness . Let me explain how that came about . I want to lay it all out . My friends , I hope this last journal of mine will reach you , so you can be with me , with my thoughts , as long as it takes you to read it , and I can be with you as long as it takes me to write it , and beyond , though I am not sure there is much beyond . <p> On Vidovdan , St. Vitius Day , though it was a sunny day early in the summer , it was muggy , with all the steam and coal smoke from trains sitting in the valley . I sweated as I rushed to a photo shop so my friends and historians would have an image of me after I was gone ; maybe it was vain of me to imagine they needed anything like that , but on the other hand , I had friends and a sister who loved me , so who was I to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be selfish of me not to leave them a part of myself . I paid extra to have the picture done in an hour in several copies ; it was expensive , but soon I would not need money , so I did n't care . I marveled that it could be done so quickly . Who knows what else soon could be speedily done in this world of ours-I regretted getting ready to depart it without seeing the technological miracles to come . Maybe one day letters would be sent without our having to lick stamps . Now I chuckled as I licked the backs of the dull images of sagging Franz Josef with mustaches fit for a walrus for the letters and humorless Franz Ferdinand for the postcards . Sure , soon there wo n't be any need for these images one way or another , I would help that . I sat down at a park bench a few blocks away from the river Miljacka and wrote to my friends-and I wanted to say goodbye to my sister , Jovanka , to a girl I loved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister I wrote , I must go far away . Goodbye . We will never see each other again . I wept when I wrote that . <p> To a friend I wrote : Tomorrow I will not be alive anymore ; I am dying of an unspeakable pulmonary illness . I loved our walks . ( I had n't imagined at the time how true that would be ; I thought I was lying when I wrote that about the illness . I had expected execution , maybe being shot on the spot without a trial , but here I am , while recalling all this , afflicted with a bloody cough , shivering from TB , but let that not distract me from recalling that day . ) <p> I had not imagined I would be so emotional about saying goodbye . My dog , Vuk , followed me everywhere as though he knew we would n't see each other again . I petted him , even pulled out a fat dark tick from his ear and crushed it with my leather sole on the cobbles , and heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own blood tasty , and then he licked my chin . Although I would have preferred a different sequence , first my chin , then the tick , I let him . I did not need to fear disease now , and why be disgusted ? I was not a Viennese or Parisian noble or burgher to indulge squeamishness , though I was tempted to yield to it , such is the power of culture and slavish indoctrination that we provincials adopted . Vuk gave me the last lick and then shadowed me down the street . I shouted at him to go back , and he pretended to , after curling his tail , but when I rounded the next corner , there he was . I carried him back , and as I was closing the wooden gate , he still managed to get out , so I pushed him back in and kicked him hard in the chest . I could hear him even a kilometer away , howling . I felt miserable . I was tempted to go back and give up the business of making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be compared with the real life and love of such a creature as a German shepherd ? I did n't blame him for being called a German , though I hated everything German ; he had nothing to do with them , he only had that name , poor soul , they managed to colonize even animals . Now I did n't like the idea of never again . But no , this would not be the matter of personal feelings , I should be able to transcend those . <p> I had expected crowds to throng along the river boulevard , Appel Quay , awaiting the Archduke 's parade , and they did , but where I stood , next to a gas lamppost , there was plenty of space . In my sagging jacket , my hands were getting clammy and cold , and the grenade metal was warmer than they were . I wished I had a Browning like the rest of them ; that would have been more straightforward , but I proved to be such a bad shot , and I skipped practices . My hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrate . Now , that is not a problem when I swing something like a stone , or a grenade . As a child in Trebinje I loved throwing stones . I could do it for hours , aiming at trees and lampposts , and I was the best thrower in my street . Even now as an adult in late night walks in Belgrade in Kalemegdan Park , I would for no reason at all pick up stones and throw them at lampposts . I was an atheist , yet I admired the story of David and Goliath . After reading it in my grandmother 's crumbly Bible in Cyrillic , I walked out and filled up my pockets with stones , and challenged the biggest bully in the neighborhood . He ran after me . I turned around , and aimed at his head , released the stone , and hit him in the middle of his forehead . For years later he had the scar . I feared that one day he would beat the hell out of me , but he did not . He had ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinking I would be a kind of David , but all of a sudden my hand shook too much . Actually , I should have felt privileged to have the bomb . A couple of days before , when I chatted on a train with strangers , Gavrilo , who thought I was being indiscreet , took my bomb away . I could have strangled him for that ; I was no doubt stronger than he , but he had the support of our group , and they all gave me hell for talking too much . Only a few hours before standing in the street did I get back the bomb from my arrogant and bossy friend , in a sweets shop . We did n't drink , but we all loved cream pies . I do n't even know how I managed to still consider him a friend . <p> Now I could n't back out . What would my friends think of me ? Gavrilo would laugh . Well , now I thought I was cowardly , but nobody else must know it . And what if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went over to a gendarme and told him about the whole plot . I could save the future Monarch . I would have wanted to save his wife , who was a Czech , and at least she should be spared , but she was married to him , so she was a traitor as well , and if she went , so be it . <p> I imagined the Monarch would continue to oppress Bosnia , and all the Slavs in it . Everybody who wanted to advance would still have to study in German , and bow to the pasty and cheesy Germans as though they were higher beings . I 'd have to bow even to the drunken Hungarian slobs . Anyway , if I told a policeman of the plot , I would get no credit , but would be jailed for being a conspirator . It would be a different matter if they gave me a nice apartment in Paris and a pension for the rest of my life . But of course , they would n't do that , they would jail me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life would that be ? Somebody from the Black Hand or Mlada Bosna would kill me as a traitor . <p> And what if I just quietly slunk away , walked over the bridge to the other side of the river , and up the mountain all the way to Pale , to enjoy the fresh air , the beautiful views ? Who was to say that the other comrades could actually kill the Archduke ? I had no confidence in the whole lot . So if I did n't do it , who could ? <p> However , if I succeeded , would n't I be sorry to die ? I have never made love , nothing that would count , anyway ; I have not yet finished reading Crime and Punishment . But so what ? What kind of life do I have to wait for ? Work , and shrieking children who 'll be starving to death , while I slave twelve hours a day in some miserable printing press outfit , sorting out letters , and poisoning myself with lead , and if I get tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into coal mines to feed the Austrian trains , so the gentlemen and the soft women with garters could frolic all over our rails ? Plus , what 's left in the novel-I got stuck in the middle , and suddenly it grew boring with all the conspiracies and confessions and weeping . <p> But now was no time to get lost in thought . The six cars were glimmering , reflecting shafts of prickly sunlight , so it looked like thin swords flying at me . What if I did n't notice the Archduke in time ? What if I mistook the General Potiorek for him ; the General was imitating the Duke . I looked around . There was a gendarme some ten paces away from me . Did he notice I was looking at him ? Should I have been scared of him ? Well , now that I glared at him , he would be aware of me , and the best way then was not to be stealthy . I was tempted to tell him what I was about to do , just to amaze him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked up to him , and said , Sir , could you please tell me in what car his Highness is ? <p> Oh , yes , in the second one , over there . He pointed out the shiniest car . <p> Thank you for the directions , I said . <p> Oh , do n't mention it . We are all excited-such an incredible privilege to see the next Emperor right here ! <p> I moved away from the gendarme , and noticed the peacocky feathers above the Duke 's head . <p> I tore off the bomb cap . It was louder than I expected . I saw the driver in the approaching first car shrink back and look over and accelerate . Did he suspect what it was ? Now , it would definitely go off . I was stuck . What should I do with the bomb now ? To throw it in the river behind ? What would that do ? Kill a few fish feeding on an Austrian clerk 's dung ? How long could the bomb wait in my hands ? Ten seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my pocket . My teeth chattered as though cold winter winds had suddenly begun to blow through my thin clothes . <p> The second car was close , approaching from my left , slowly , some twenty paces away . Very few policemen stood at the sidewalk . I had expected more of them ; maybe there were many undercover agents around ? But , maybe not . The Archduke boasted that he did not need high security ; he wanted to appear brave . Maybe he was brave . It was easy to be brave with so much army at your command , even if the army was away . <p> Eight seconds . It looked unbelievably easy . I would never have such an opportunity again . Maybe just one strike , and I could liberate the Serbs-Austrians might get the message that they were not wanted , or there would be war , but at any rate , freedom from foreigners would come sooner or later . Maybe many people would die , but then the rest would live . Now , nobody lived . <p> Six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . The Duchess smiled , basking in the hazy sunshine . She had moist lips , gleaming teeth , looked fresh , that 's what having underlings does for you . I knew that she hardly ever took trips with her husband , and she never rode with him in parades in Vienna because she was not of royal birth and therefore was not allowed to , but this time she must have done him a favor , or he had perhaps told her of the quaint beauties of the Balkans , and she could not resist the tourist temptations . She looked comfortable , pleasant , but what right did she have to her happiness ? <p> I pulled out the bomb , with maybe three seconds left , still sort of hiding it with my palm . At that moment the Archduke shot me a glance , a steady , cold glance . For a second our eyes were locked , and I hated that calm , the superiority in his gaze , which analyzed me as though I were a specimen in a zoo . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derided me , convinced that I could n't do it , that he was so much above me that I was fit only to crawl at his feet and lick the shoe polish off his boots , and that even that would be a great favor to me . You will pay for this , I thought , and lifted my arm high and flung toward those eyes . But I had been too eager , and the metal slid from my clammy skin a little too soon . The bomb was flying in an arc above the Archduke 's head . The duke , obviously understanding the bomb was flying at his wife on the other side of him , lifted his arm , and the bomb deflected from it , hit the car roof cloth , which was drawn back for the good weather , bounced off it , and fell on the pavement under the third car , where it exploded , with shrapnel whistling , and then ensued the screams of the struck pedestrians . The second car sped away , and a dozen men were running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper , from my left pocket and stuffed it into my mouth , together with a bit of the wrapping , so I would n't spill the powder , more than enough to kill me , but my throat was so dry I could not swallow . I pulled out the paper , and tried to make spittle in my mouth to swallow . By no means did I want to be caught by the police ; now I 'd have to die . I jumped over the fence and into the river , into the shallow water , which trickled among the rocks . I sprained my ankle , but no matter , why worry about that now ? <p> A dozen civilians and policemen jumped after me into the river . I did not run away , did not resist , but threw myself prostrate into the cold water . The policemen grabbed me , pulled me up , twisted my arms , hit me with their clubs over the head . I felt a trickle of warm urine in my pants-even if I thought I was not afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind to pay attention to it ; something in my body was afraid . Why did I have so much water down there , and so little in my mouth ? My throat was still choking dry . The hits blazed in my head , they were hot . <p> Do n't bother beating me , I said . I 've taken poison and have only a minute to live . So do n't waste your time ! <p> As they dragged me away , I felt nauseated . The poison is working , I thought . Am I ready to die ? Yes , I am ready . That 'll be easier than dealing with the police and the trials , and they 'd kill me , anyway . How ? Would they hang me on the gallows , in a public performance ? Would they shoot me with my eyes covered in black cloth ? Would a crowd gather ? Would they all cheer , even those who hated the Austrians , even they would cheer , so they would not be suspected of wanting the end of Austria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along their children , so they would learn to obey and fear the authorities ? Would Jovanka come out , and die from grief ? <p> I felt like vomiting , but could not vomit . <p> Who are you ? What is your name ? a short policeman shouted into my nose , as though it were my nose that should have been able to listen , his breath stinking from rotten teeth and plum brandy . <p> I am a Serbian hero ! I shrieked . And that was true , at that moment I realized it was true ; my words worked faster than my mind . It felt good to say that . Now everything seemed worth it . I even straightened up , and my head and spine and shins all tingled-from a mixture of pain and pride . <p> Name , what is your name ? <p> What 's in a name ? I told you . Names come from fathers , but a heroic deed from deep inside . ( I was thinking it was n't such a bad throw-I was just a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and did n't really count , that was not bad ; actually , the car would have been past me in a second or two-so I did pretty well . They certainly knew they were not welcome ! ) <p> Name ! the officer said , and kicked me below the kneecap , so I suddenly lost balance as my muscles jerked . <p> They gave me blows as we went along . Old men with walking sticks jabbed at me . People hollered , spat . Blood flowed down my head and glued my eyes . I did not mind that warm feeling on my face ; it felt as though it were enveloping me , protecting me , healing me . As long as there was blood on me , I felt safe . It does n't make any sense , but what can I tell you , that is how I felt . Actually , I even felt happy . I had done my job . I was free now . They could jail me , kill me , but I had done what I had set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . I smiled from joy . No matter what they did to me , they could not take away my heroic deed . I did n't need to accomplish anything anymore . This was it . This was better than getting a doctorate or an Olympic medal . <p> I do n't know how much time elapsed in a dark room in the military barracks , where I sprawled on a wooden bench along the wall , or whether the room was dark or only my vision failing . Several officers came in and interrogated me during the day , and again they came at night , and kept repeating the same questions , to try to catch me lying . I was lying at first , but later , it made no difference , except I did not want to give them any names , such as where I slept , because I knew that could get the people I knew into trouble . It seemed to me they were gullible , and I could tell them anything , and they would write it down and believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone or with an organization , such as Black Hand , more for a joke than anything else , I said , I am working for the International Free Masons . <p> I knew nothing about the Free Masons , except that Catholic Austrians were scared of them and believed in all sorts of conspiracy theories involving the Masons . I told them we were trying to create a world without monarchs , monarchies , and countries , just one peaceful world . <p> Strange enough , they believed this and , from what I heard later on , kept bringing it up for months , in courts , in the newspapers-just one little joke threw them off so much . I wish I had given them more silly lies , but they kept harping on this one so much , without ever getting it , that I grew bored . They were not a fun bunch at all . <p> The lamplight was right in front of me on the table , so I saw nothing beyond it , and the police voices came from behind it , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly men , but having voices like that just coming at me was spooky . <p> Who worked with you ? <p> Nobody , I answered . <p> But that is not true , we know it is not true . Several men after you drew their guns and took shots at the Crowned Prince . He is dead . Are you glad ? <p> I did not know what to think . I was glad , and I was not , glad . So , someone else managed to do it ! I thought I was the only one who could , and just trying was good enough , but someone actually did it , on His Majesty 's way back on the Quay . <p> Did they kill anybody else ? I asked . <p> Yes , His Majesty 's Wife . <p> Who killed them ? <p> Gavrilo Princip . You know him ? <p> I knew of him . But I did n't know he planned to do this . <p> Strange to say , I felt jealous of Princip . I 'd never expected him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a Serbian saint , and I would die in obscurity . But I was happy , too . I had many emotions , as much as I could in my dazed state . The tyrant was gone . We did it . After all , it was a beautiful plan , to have several men , one after another , shoot , and maybe none of them would have , if I had n't started it all , showed how possible it was . But how did the Archduke even get the idea to drive again down the Quay ? My bomb must have confused everybody and made the real assassination possible . <p> The interrogations went on interminably . Sometimes they had to repeat a question two or three times because I just could not think and concentrate . They thought I was spiteful , and they pulled my ears as though I were a schoolboy , but they no longer hit . <p> They manipulated me and toyed with my emotions . Do n't lie , a policeman said , we know Gavrilo is one of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confessed he was tempted to shoot you after you threw your bomb and failed to kill yourself . He said if you had n't been so far he would have shot you and then himself , so nobody would find out about the plot , how do you like that ? <p> Of course , I did n't like that . Just to think of it , the gall that boy had . He certainly made better friends with ideas than with people . Any moment , if he became a political leader , he 'd shoot off his friends , if he thought the ideas called for it . I was disgusted . I guess he had what it took to become a great leader . But maybe they had lied to me . <p> Are you sorry for what you did ? They repeated that question many times . <p> I certainly was not , and if I was , it had to do only with my failure to accomplish the deed . And I felt sorry for all the pedestrians I wounded . They were now in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care system , which was not ours , of course , but Austrian , some of them might get gangrene , and die slowly , painfully , all because of my imprecision . I should have controlled my emotions better : I had thrown too hard in my zeal and rashness . Just one more second of aiming and self-control would have done it . I was a second or two too fast for history , or history was too slow for my nervous temperament . <p> I was sick for a couple of days , vomiting . I could not keep any food down . The cyanide was working , to some extent , enough to burn my throat . I think it was old and stale . It would have been better if the explosive had been too old , and the poison fresh . I still hoped to die , but could not die . I was too weak to die . In my room , I slept terribly ; my throat and nose burned . I shivered , though it was not cold , but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sleep , the chains clanked and clattered , and rang dull . They were cold and heavy . Still , I managed to move around during the day . There was terrible shrieking and wailing coming out of the yard . I peeped through the window , and saw the police clubbing dozens of men , Serbs . It was sunny and hot , and those who were not beaten were forced to look at the sun ; many of them had their mouths open from all the heat and no water . There were n't that many people that had anything to do with us . This mass beating was totally arbitrary and irrational . The wailing , the pain , echoed from the walls , grew stronger , and the echoes and the original screams mixed up in a dizzying , pulsating sorrow . There , we wanted freedom for our people , but this was a far cry from it . Some of the men doubling over were old , some were n't men at all but children . I did n't know what to do about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't even do that . When the gallows were raised , and men were being hanged-for what ? for who they were ? -a gendarme shot at me . He narrowly missed . The glass above my head shattered , one fragment cut into my cheek , and others splashed on the floor in smithereens . So now I could not watch , but I could hear even better through the broken glass . <p> After the hangings , the following day , more beatings went on for hours . I was sorry for causing this grief , but at the same time this strengthened my hatred for the monarchy , and I wished I had managed to kill the Monarch and the General . <p> It was terribly lonely in the cell . I could not talk to my friends . I did come up with a system of messages-I wrote at the bottom of my plate , and the plates went from one room to another . Princip and Ilic caught on , and we exchanged drawings , jokes , and so on . We also tapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had learned the code for each letter beforehand One day I tapped a code into Ilic 's wall , but he did not respond . I was sure he had hanged himself . So I tapped the message to Princip , who tapped back that he was saddened by the news . The next day Ilic tapped to me-I was overjoyed that he was alive , and so was Princip when I communicated the news to him . I had certainly jumped to conclusions too easily ; I was so nervous and jumpy . But communicating through the wall in code was not good enough for me to have a sense of community , and I was lonely . If nothing else , I knew that tapping for a while would bring an angry Austrian guard , who would shout at me to stop . After he went , I continued , and then he 'd come in again and shout . I was amazed that they could not decipher our codemaybe they did n't even know we were communicating . <p> We were all gathered for the trial in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now we all had small beards , goatees , from not shaving . None of us had firm black beards , we all looked Chekhovian . This was the first time I saw my friends since the end of June , so for a while I did n't pay any attention to what the judge was saying . I giggled from happiness at being with my friends . After all we were just boys ; and if only we had stuck to being boys . It felt like we were ignoring a lesson at school , and the fat judge 's bad temper made it only all the more entertaining . <p> Princip was proud and belligerent . His nose was broader than before from the beatings he got in the streets upon his arrest , but he spoke clearly , in a strong and sonorous manner . I wondered where he had strength for such a voice . I was much bigger than him , yet my voice was weak , it could never ring . <p> What hurt me most was that I heard that a kind man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his house on our way to Sarajevo , was executed . I did not let them have his name , maybe Princip did . What bad luck for him . He did not even know what we were up to , and now his children would have to grow up without him . The prosecutor used that as an example of how we should not get off easy if a man like that had to die for what we did . For that I was truly sorry . <p> And my sorrow deepened when the prosecutor said , Do you know what the Archduke 's last words were ? " Sophie , dear , please do not die . Our children need you . " <p> Can you imagine that ? You orphaned three children ! You certainly deserve to die , underage or not . <p> I had not known that the Archduke had children . And that as he was dying he thought of his children , as no doubt did his wife , that did something to me . I was totally unprepared for this , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the accumulation of sorrowful news . I am sure my father would n't bother to think of me . Those children had been lucky to have parents who loved them , but they were also unlucky to have us . <p> The prosecutor showed us the pictures of the lovely children . One boy had thick black hair , wavy , shiny , it was parted just like mine , from right to left , with a thick wave ; the older one had short hair and a serious look , the same angle of brows as mine , almost the same mirthless expression as mine , as though he had been posing for history as well . If you took the two boys and mixed up their features , you would get me in my boyhood ; I felt a strong kinship with them . How could they look like me ? How did they get stuck in the royal family ? The girl , with a white bow on her pate , had wonderfully rich hair draped over her shoulder into her lap , and she , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camera , but the mother , from whom they must have inherited the beauty , looked at them , mostly at her daughter , in a posture of pride and worry , as though she had a premonition . Nobody was smiling here . And why not ? Should n't children be happy ? Maybe they had never been happy . I felt sorry for them that they had such a father . Maybe that 's why they could not laugh although they were just children . Maybe they would grow up to be monsters , maybe not . They were pretty and soulful , that must have been their Slavic side . <p> Sophie , dear , please do not die . That line kept sounding in my head , and I could not stop it . It was driving me insane . I could not listen to the interrogation after this , and I jumped out of my seat and shouted , We are sorry for what we did , we are sorry that we orphaned children ... I know I gave a whole speech , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that everybody listened to me for a while . Damn it , I was a good speaker . <p> Speak for yourself , Princip cut in . I am not sorry . They have orphaned many of our children , why are n't you sorry for them ! Do n't ever talk in my name ! <p> I am deeply sorry . I am surprised he is n't . I ... I- At that point my voice choked from tears that went backward , not down my nose , but into my throat . Only if I 'd had that salty liquid when I had tried to swallow cyanide-maybe I would n't have had to face what I did to these children , would n't have had to quarrel in court with Gavro . <p> He just wants mercy , Gavrilo said . <p> You stay quiet , I said . What do you know about me ? What do you know about people ? You know only books and ideas . No , I do n't want mercy . In fact , I want punishment . All I want before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how can they forgive me ? No , it 's better that they not forgive me . <p> Sophie , dear , our children need you . Please do n't die . I imagined the children next to the casket , trying to reach for their mama , to kiss her ; they could n't , maybe they would be struck by fear of death , maybe disgust , maybe they would not be allowed . That must have already happened . What did they do ? Did they break down and cry out , in shrill screams , the world breaking down in shafts of cathedral light , through stained glass , full of vermilion , lit up by their tears ? Or did they stay quiet , stunned , with the grief too deep for tears , their voices subdued , muffled ; perhaps they could not utter a word ; maybe they could not breathe . Maybe they felt pretty much the way I did , when the police showered me with blows in the head and groin ? Maybe they lost control , wetted , from terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I could not control my emotions . I wept right there in the court for the family I had attempted to kill . I did not care what people thought . And the fact that I was the only one in our group weeping made me think I should weep even more , for the hard-heartedness of my comrades . <p> I would not have minded just wasting their father . In fact , I think that would have been a favor to them . I had hated my father , and he 'd hated me ; he beat me daily . And when I grew bigger and stronger , and he could n't easily subdue me , he had me jailed once when I had a quarrel with our maid ; he 'd come home with a gendarme . I 'd asked her to undress for me , and she refused , and shouted at me to get out . I had n't even touched her . I do n't know why that made such a big impression on my father .

I still have a scar there . The back of my neck is pretty hairy , but nothing grows in the diagonal of the burn . That 's all because of my father , I am sure ; I do n't think anybody liked him . He ran a tavern , and since he could n't pass up on opportunities to make money , he 'd become a police informant . What better job for an informant than to ply guests with brandy ?

Without my father 's odious influence on me , I would not have become a member of such a subversive group . I was glad about dead fathers . However , that their mother was killed , that was terrible . Maybe it was even terrible that their father was killed ; maybe they liked him , maybe he was even a good father . I am not the one to judge that , the children only could . <p> I could no longer listen to the trial .

Probably not . They will hear the story of the assassination , however . They will hate Princip and me . They could never forgive us . <p> If they liked to drink hot chocolate with their mother , they will not drink it again . <p> The judge surprised me by ordering us to be imprisoned rather than executed because we were not twenty years old yet . Several people who were over twenty , even though they had hardly anything to do with the conspiracy , were to be executed , hanged , and several already were , in our yard , and in Trebinje , my native town . In a way , I would have preferred summary execution . Now I would spend years in prison , I would not even be allowed to read the newspapers . If I could follow the course of the war in prison , that would be a different matter , I would not have minded it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever we had aspired for , the collapse of the Hapsburgs , the emancipation of the South Slavs , would happen ; then it would have been worth it . We were transferred to the prison in Theresienstadt , three of us : Princip , Grabez , and I. That was a miserable journey in the cold train ; we were chained to our benches , our bones were rattled and , after all the clanking , felt broken . <p> In Theresienstadt , the bed was hard , flea-infested , cold . There was no heat at night , and I was chained in shackles and chains weighing over ten kilograms , which conducted all the heat out of my body . The water in the jug sometimes froze overnight . If it had n't , I would not have known whether it was all my imagination that it was cold , but there was no doubt , it was . It took me several months to realize that if I put the ball , which I could barely lift , under covers , together with the chains , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold . By then , I had got the chronic chills , so it did not matter anymore that I had figured out a way of protecting my heat . <p> I got TB somehow . I found out that Gavrilo also had it . Maybe we all had TB even before the assassination . I know Princip said he probably had it , and Grabez thought he might have it , and maybe that is why they were willing to die . I coughed every winter , but it did not mean I had TB . I believed I did not have it . How could we all have TB ? I think the Austrians gave it to us , intentionally ; they gave us contaminated food and stale water , I am sure , in prison . They were not allowed to execute us by law , but they would do it stealthily by implanting disease in us . I am quite certain that they did it . Once they found out we had TB , they did nothing to save us . They could have sent us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did not . That was their way of killing us . <p> I have n't had much will to live lately . The walls in the prison are so thick I can not tap codes to Gavro and Grabez . I am terribly lonely , so lonely that I even accept visits by a priest . The priest can be a bore ; he wants me to confess , to pray with him , and he does n't know any jokes . I told him one , and he did not laugh . It was the only decent joke I knew . Two Montenegrins stand on the pier and notice a boat sinking and hear men screaming for help . <p> One Montenegrin says , Look at that , men are drowning , and we are just standing . <p> You are right about that , says the other . Let 's sit down . <p> Instead of laughing at the joke , the priest wanted to pray with me . And so we prayed . I meant it all , and still do . I pray with him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And just today , it seems the prayers are working . The priest has brought me a letter in a beautiful handwriting . Dear Nedjeljko : We forgive you . We feel sorry for you that you have to suffer so much . We know you were misguided . May God forgive you , too , and bless you . We know you are a good soul , you have repented . <p> That was a letter from the Archduke 's children ! I did not know how to react ; I was purely amazed . I kept rereading the letter , admiring every curl and slant in the calligraphically drawn letters . I had always loved letters-it was no accident that I 'd become a typesetter-but none were quite as beautiful as these . I smell the page-it smells of lilac and ink . I am swooning as I inhale . Maybe I would be swooning , anyway . I am not even aware when the priest left . Maybe he has not left . Maybe he is here to bury me . Maybe I am dying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I doubt . I need to see the envelope . If it does n't have a stamp , how will I know where it came from ? Maybe the priest wrote it . Maybe that was one little benevolent lie he came up with out of compassion for me , but I doubt it ; he is n't capable of such beauty , such handwriting . I feel around the table with my fingers , and pick up a fine beige envelope . There is a blue seal , which says , Wien . So it 's true , it 's a letter from them , the beautiful souls whom I have injured . Suddenly , I notice Franz Ferdinand is gazing from the envelope , from under the green feathers of his hat , with his cold , hateful concentration , looking straight into me , just the way he did at the moment I was flinging the grenade at him , in that awful contemptuous manner ! I do n't want to look at the image . Is this a ghost ? I cover the image with my thumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , I wo n't let him lurk like this . I am tearing the stamp and his image into small pieces , and I am eating it , relishing the glue and ink in my throat . <p> This confession in the form of a letter , apparently written in the authentic trembling hand of Nedjeljko Cabrinovic in his prison cell in Theresienstadt in January , 1916 , was recently found in the loft of a long-deceased priest , N.M. , before his house was to be torn down in order to create expansion space for the world-famous beer brewery in Plzen . For a while , D.M. , the CEO of the brewery , kept the letter and reread it to various dinner guests as a prize , but when he read it to Sacerby , the Bosnian minister demanded that the letter be given over to the Bosnian government in Sarajevo for the archives . Whether the letter had been destroyed in the Sarajevo siege , or whether it still exists in some private hands , or in public hands , remains a mystery , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brewery guests , as the closest possible approximation to the original . <p> The writing ceases here , at the bottom of the mouse-chipped page of the vanished original . The story , or rather , the history , does not end here , nor for that matter with the addendum , which follows : <p> The Sarajevo police department demanded from the Theresienstadt military prison that Cabrinovic 's corpse be beheaded and his skull sent to Sarajevo , where it would be preserved and kept in a museum , in a jar , for future generations . After a lengthy exchange of letters among various departments of the Austrian government , it was decided that Cabrinovic 's corpse should be left intact . Many people schemed to get his and Princip 's bones ; it would not have been the first case of a missing skull . The skull of Bogdan Zerajic , who had attempted to assassinate a provincial governor in Bosnia in igio , was displayed in the Sarajevo Criminal Museum . The chief police inspector in Sarajevo occasionally used Zerajic 's skull as an inkpot to threaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their skulls would serve the same letter-writing purpose . In 1919 , Zerajic 's skull was put back together with his body , but in 1920 when the body was exhumed to be placed in a common grave , the skull was missing again , and thus his headless body was placed with those of Princip ( whose corpse was whole , except for a missing arm , which TB of the bones had destroyed ) , Grabez , and several other conspirators , including Cabrinovic , in the common grave . <p> Author Affiliation
