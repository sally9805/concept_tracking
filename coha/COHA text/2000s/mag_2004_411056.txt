Famous for bold stars and strong , linear features , the Hunter trims his warrior attire with some of the most gorgeous nebulae in the sky . // BY TOM POLAKIS // No constellation dominates the winter sky like Orion the Hunter . Its brightest stars form one of the best known celestial shapes , which is visible even from cities . The plane of the Milky Way clips the northeast corner of the constellation and manifests itself as a featureless , hazy band through the neighboring constellations of Gemini and Monoceros. * Orion 's seven brightest stars are all 2nd magnitude or better . Most spectacular is Rigel , which shines at nearly magnitude O despite its great distance , just shy of 1,000 light-years . A 7th-magnitude companion to Rigel lies just 9 ' ' ' to the south . Betelgeuse is a red giant half as far away as Rigel . With an angular size of over 0.1 ' ' ' ' , Betelgeuse 's diameter would encompass the orbit of Jupiter . All three of Orion 's " belt stars " are blue-white suns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for the large number of 6th-and 7th-magnitude stars clustered around the belt . We begin observing in Orion with an unlikely target . The tiny planetary nebula J320 was discovered by French observer Robert Jonckheere in 1916 . It is bright enough to be visible through a 6-inch telescope , but picking it out from the star field can be a challenge . " Blinking " the field with a nebula filter will cause the almost star-like disk of J320 to pop into view . In my 10-inch scope at 250x , the circular disk appears 5 ' ' ' across with a bright center . A pan of nearly 10 due south brings a bright carbon star into the field . At its brightest , W Orionis is easily found with a finder scope , but it fades as faint as 12th magnitude over a period of 214 days . Large-aperture telescopes reveal its ruddy hue , which is best detected using direct vision . The color of this cool star comes from its sooty outer layer . Photograph ORION is easily recognized thanks to its bright stars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunter 's belt . ALAN DYER // Two degrees north of the 3rd-magnitude star Beta ( beta ) Eridani lies the reflection nebula NGC 1788 . In a 10-inch scope , it looks bright and measures 3 ' by 2 ' ' . The nebula has two lobes ; the western lobe surrounds a 10th-magnitude star while the eastern lobe has a small , bright concentration of light at its center . The edge of the nebulosity is diffuse , and the south end meets dark nebula LDN 1616 , which is apparent from the lack of background stars over a 5-arcminute-wide region . NGC 1788 hosts ongoing star formation and is illuminated by a small cluster of stars hidden from view . Although Orion holds plenty of alluring targets , telescopes seem to be magnetically attracted to M42 ( NGC 1976 ) , the Orion Nebula . Let 's begin by investigating the scene with a small , rich-field scope . Between two pairs of bright stars sits a cloud that appears to have two curved wings and a very bright clump of stars near its center . Increasing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trapezium , which includes four bright , young stars bom from the nebula . Just to the east of the Trapezium , a bright , scalloped bar embeds itself in the haze . When viewed through a larger scope , the curved wings can be traced around to meet each other , forming a full circle . Large telescopes reveal two more stars in the Trapezium and show a field filled with mottled detail . The eastern wing has a ruddy appearance - one of the few deepsky objects bright enough to show its red color to visual observers . The Orion Nebula is brightest around the Trapezium , where it shines with a lime-green tint . Protruding into the glowing region is the dark " fish mouth " of obscuring material that borders the nebulosity . As with most of the nebulae in the vicinity of Orion 's belt , M42 is 1,500 light-years away and just a small enhancement in a giant molecular cloud . Embedded in the nebulosity is the Orion Nebula Cluster , a gathering of more than 4,000 stars with an average age of only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active star formation , M42 has been well studied . Astronomers have found more than a hundred proplyds ( accretion disks surrounding young stars ) in the Orion Nebula . Some of these stars discharge high-velocity jets of gas , creating shock waves in the surrounding medium . Although M43 ( NGC 1982 ) has its own designation , it 's difficult to consider it a distinct object from the Orion Nebula . A circular halo about 4 ' in diameter , M43 appears just north of the " fish mouth " feature of M42 . Look for a sharp truncation , caused by a dark nebula , along the eastern edge of the round haze . Telescopes show the bright variable star NU Orionis at the center of M43 . Shining at a relatively constant 7th magnitude , this star varies by only 0.1 magnitude . Photograph THE ORION NEBULA glows brilliantly as the middle " star " in Orion 's sword . Also known as M42 , the famous nebula seems to be connected to the smaller M43 to the north .

JOHNA.VOLK BARNARD 'S LOOP , or Sh2-276 , wraps around the eastern side of Orion 's torso . GERALD RHEMANN // A half degree north of the Orion Nebula , NGC 1975 highlights a complex of reflection nebulae sometimes called the Running Man Nebula . Through a 13-inch scope , NGC 1975 appears as an elongated , bright nebula with a mottled texture . The 5th-magnitude stars 42 and 45 Orionis are embedded in a dark rift that divides two prominent strips of nebulosity. // Deep-sky objects in Orion // Slightly more than 1 south-southeast of M42 lies the reflection nebula NGC 1999 , which would be rather ordinary were it not for a dark obscuration near its center . This feature initially creates the impression of a ring-shaped planetary nebula , but increased magnification shows the dark nebula 's triangular form . Just outside the dark cloud sits V380 Orionis , a variable star that illuminates this reflection nebula . The bright emission nebula NGC 2024 , or the Flame Nebula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeta ( zeta ) Orionis . A magnification of around 10Ox proves high enough to remove the star from the field but low enough to show the entire nebula . NGC 2024 resembles a U shape with squared edges . A nebula filter shows the edges ' complexity , which gives rise to the flame moniker . Like many of our objects , NGC 2024 lies in the Orion Molecular Cloud at a distance of 1,500 light-years . The ionizing source for the emission nebula is visible only at infrared wavelengths . Panning 30 ' south of Zeta Orionis brings a popular star-party target into view . Dark nebula Barnard 33 ( Horsehead Nebula ) has twenty-seven times more mass than the Sun and is similar in structure to the " elephant trunks " of the Eagle Nebula . We see the Horsehead only because it is silhouetted against IC 434 , a background emission nebula ( the brightest part of which measures 15 ' by 5 ' ' ) . Look first for a dark feature 5 ' in diameter superimposed on this bright nebula . The horse 's shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnifications greater than 100x . Use a filter that allows the Hbeta emission band to pass through , such as a wide-band nebula filter or a specialized H-beta filter . Photograph THE TRAPEZIUM REGION at the center of the Orion Nebula ( M42 ) holds a stellar cluster dominated by four bright , young stars born within the nebula . A dark bar ( forming the bottom " lip " of the " fish mouth " ) protrudes into the bright nebula and points out the Trapezium stars .

PRESTON SCOTT JUSTIS NGC 1975 forms an interesting complex of reflection nebulae with NGCs 19 and 19PP . Some call the group the Running Man Nebula . ANDREW PETERS NGC 1999 may look like a ring nebula at first , but closer inspection will reveal a dark , triangular nebula obscuring its center . OSS/POSS2/UKSTU // To the north and east of Barnard 33 , you 'll find M78 ( NGC 2068 ) , one of the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this nebula bracket an 11th-magnitude star . In a 13-inch scope , M78 spans 5 ' ' , showing an abrupt northwestern edge and an ill-defined southern edge . A dark lane divides M78 from the much fainter mist of NGC 2067 to the northwest . A quarter degree to the north lies NGC 2071 , which adds another reflection nebula to the scene . Backing off to the lowest magnification reveals a gray and mostly starless background , indicative of an associated molecular cloud . Sh2-276 ( Barnard 's Loop ) appears best through a rich-field telescope . The nebula 's main strip is some 6 long and tapers at the northwestern end . My 8-inch f/4 at 30x brings out a slight enhancement to the field 's brightness when a nebula filter is in place . Binoculars may be better than a rich-field instrument because they can take in a good part of the loop . Deep photographs show a true , circumscribed loop covering much of the constellation . The brightest part of Barnard 's Loop is found around star cluster NGC 2112 . This cluster contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area 8 ' in diameter . The cluster is loose and scattered but has a strong background glow hinting at the presence of dozens of unresolved stars . NGC 2112 lies 2,800 light-years away from us and 600 light-years above the galaxy 's plane . Photograph THE FLAME NEBULA ( NGC 2024 ) has branches of nebulosity that lick the sky just as campfire flames reach into a cold night . Zeta Orionis lies beyond the bottom edge of the frame . A. TREMBLY , JR . THE HORSEHEAD NEBULA , or Barnard 33 , is perhaps the most distinctive dark nebula and a favorite of astrophotographers . JACK NEWTON M78 ( upper right ) overwhelms the dimmer mist of NGC 2067 while NGC 2071 holds its own a bit farther away ( lower left ) . KIM ZUSSMAN // Moving northward , we find a bright target for an 8-inch scope : planetary nebula NGC 2022 . Using a magnification of 300x , the nebula 's 15 " disk has a hazy edge . A larger instrument begins to reveal a dark center , implying a ring structure . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most observers . Pan your scope 3 northeast of Betelgeuse to find Mu ( ) Orionis . With a nebula filter , you should be able to spot the disk of planetary nebula Abell 12 , which appears to touch the bright star . The filter suppresses the star 's glare and darkens the surrounding sky . Using the highest magnification that the seeing permits , the disk will appear 15 " across and reveal hints of annular structure . Photograph NGC 2174 is a vivid emission nebula near the tip of Orion 's club . A 7th-magnitude foreground star lies over its heart . GEORGE GREANEY and DEAN EASTON // Open cluster NGC 2141 lies less than a degree north of Abell 12 . A faint object overall , the cluster becomes well defined through larger scopes , which show dozens of equally bright stars at the limit of detection . When viewed through smaller scopes , these stars manifest themselves as a background haze with a sharp edge 10 ' in diameter . At 2.5 billion years old , NGC 2141 is an ancient cluster that lies 12,000 light-years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NGC 2194 , a fine open cluster containing several dozen stars . An assortment of stars between magnitudes 10 and 13 are spread over an area 6 ' across . Look for a concentration of 11th-magnitude stars at the cluster 's heart . Approximately 10,000 light-years separate us from NGC 2194 . At a dark site with unaided vision , an observer can spot open cluster NGC 2169 as a tiny clump just west of Xi ( xi ) Orionis . The cluster spans only 5 ' across , but it contains seven stars brighter than 9th magnitude . It is not spectacular telescopically , but the brightness of its members gives it an easily recognizable form against starry Milky Way fields . The bright emission nebula NGC 2174 perches near Orion 's border with Gemini . Situated in a rich field , the nebula appears 12 ' across and perfectly circular . It has a diffuse edge but is otherwise uniform . A 7th-magnitude star appears to shine in the center of the nebula , but it 's actually superimposed . The nebulosity is enhanced greatly with a nebula filter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the winds are laid , and the river is roaring by ; Orion swings , with his belted lights low down in the western sky . In the Moonlight , David MeKee Wright ( 1869-1928 ) Perhaps the most recognizable constellation , Orion is familiar even to the most casual astronomers . The appearance of a hunter is unmistakable : a group of stars forming a head , four bright quadrilateral stars marking shoulders and knees , three aligned stars constructing his belt , a fainter line of stars ( and a bright nebula ) outlining a sword , an extended collection of fainter stars imitating a raised club , and a bowed string of stars modeling as a shield . Ancient stargazers also identified the celestial figure as a man . Egyptians revered the celestial profile as either the god of light , Horus , or his father , Osiris ; while the Sumerians and Babylonians linked the stellar body with the king of Uruk , Gilgamesh . In fact , the Sumerian name Uru-anna ( light of the sky ) resembles the constellation 's contemporary name .

A popular legend retold by many throughout history , the Greek account of Orion 's life and death varies with the storyteller . One popular adaptation involves the huntress Artemis , who fell in love with Orion . Artemis 's brother , Apollo , disapproved of the couple , though . One day , he spotted Orion swimming in the distance and challenged his sister to hit the faraway , floating object with an arrow . Artemis was skilled , and she struck the target on her first attempt . She was devastated when Orion 's body washed ashore and she realized what she had done . Other accounts blame Orion 's demise on a scorpion . In one version , Orion boasted he could kill any beast on Earth and subsequently was attacked and killed by the scorpion . Another story claims that a scorpion was chasing Orion when he jumped into the water to escape it .
