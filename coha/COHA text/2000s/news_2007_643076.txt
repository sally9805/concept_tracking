<p> TODAY the special " vaccine court " at the United States Court of Federal Claims in Washington will begin hearing Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services , the first case of about 4,800 similar ones to examine whether childhood vaccinations can cause autism . We have no wish to comment on these legal issues . But having spent years researching the prevalence of autism in American children , we are concerned that publicity surrounding the case will only drag out debate about whether past trends indicate we face an autism " epidemic . " <p> The claims for or against an autism epidemic simply can not be proved given the evidence available . ( Public attention to the issue was set off primarily by a 1999 report by the State of California that found " a 273 percent increase in the number of persons with autism between 1987 and 1998 . " ) In the end , arguing over what the old data mean just detracts from the more pressing issues involved with scientific research and building cost-effective support systems for affected children , adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that 1 in 150 8-year-old children are on the " autism spectrum . " This proportion is alarming if compared directly to estimates of the frequency of autism before the 1990s , which were in the range of 1 per 2,000 to 5,000 . But does this really mean we have a growing autism epidemic , or have we just become better at counting autistic traits in the population that have always been there at roughly the same level ? <p> What remains undisputable is that more and more children are being labeled with autism . In 1943 , when the child psychiatrist Leo Kanner published the first case studies of autism as a medical condition , it was characterized by very severe impairments in social interaction and language and communicative abilities , combined with the presence of unusual repetitious behaviors . <p> As our understanding of the symptoms Kanner described has grown , the notion of an autism spectrum , based on gradations of severity , has evolved . Most of the more mildly affected children who are considered to be on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using older criteria . This expansion of criteria makes it impossible to compare apples to apples when looking at data on long-term trends , because what counts as " autism " is simply quite different today . <p> Another fact hinders our ability to accurately measure changes in autism prevalence : while scientists have made improvements in the ability to detect autism earlier , its causes are still not known and there are no biological diagnostic tests . Diagnosis is made by observing behavior to see if it corresponds with formal diagnostic criteria . Disagreements over whether a child has autism are not uncommon , especially among those more mildly affected . <p> Advances in techniques for monitoring autism as a public health problem have also led to statistical confusion . Whereas older studies used narrow definitions of autism and were generally based on counting the number of patients in a clinic or hospital with diagnoses of autism , modern methods use broader criteria and leave no stone unturned in the effort to find every autistic child in a defined geographic area , including those not previously given a diagnosis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous ones , even if the underlying prevalence of the condition has not changed . <p> Also contributing to the rising identification of autism  --  and many other conditions that are diagnosed in childhood like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder  --  was the growing number of federally financed efforts to find and help preschool children with developmental disabilities in the 1980s and 1990s . More recently , increased federal financing has been specifically aimed at raising awareness of the early signs of autism and the importance of early identification . It 's hardly a surprise that looking harder to find children with disabilities has resulted in more diagnoses . <p> Clearly there are many alternative explanations for changing autism prevalence . This is what makes it such a difficult phenomenon to investigate . Some who feel that autism has reached epidemic proportions cite enrollment trends in special education . In an effort to clarify things , we collected and examined the special education enrollment data from every state and for every classification category between 1984 and 2003 . We analyzed the numbers using several different statistical approaches , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . <p> According to federal data , the number of children receiving special education services for autism has increased each year since 1991 , when Washington 's guidelines first required schools to break out counts of children on the spectrum . In the 1991-92 school year , 5,415 students ages 6 to 21 in special education programs were identified as autistic . By 2005-06 , this number had grown to 192,643 , a 3,500 percent increase . <p> Though large , this increase does not necessarily provide evidence of an autism epidemic or an actual increase in the prevalence of autism . Given that schools can not respond to a federal mandate overnight , the baseline count in 1991 was clearly an underestimate of how many children in the nation truly had autism . This renders the resulting percent change estimates over time utterly uninformative about changes in true prevalence . ( In fact , if the C.D.C. 's estimate that 1 out of 150 children are on the spectrum is correct , the 2005 count still under-represents how many truly have autism . ) <p> In addition , federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not equivalent to those used for medical diagnoses , and identification practices vary widely among school districts . Before the 1990s , children with autism were tallied in other categories , though no data exist to tell us exactly which ones . <p> Urban planners know that " if you build a new road , people will drive on it . " Likewise , in special education , if you create a new counting category , people will use it . At the same time , older counting categories may then be used less frequently as our ability to differentiate diagnoses improves . And true enough , our study found that the growth in children classified with autism was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the number of special education students with other designations . <p> This is an example of " diagnostic substitution "  --  as information on new autism classifications has gradually spread , the label " autistic " has been used more commonly for children who previously would have been labeled something else . Our analyses demonstrated that from 1994 to 2003 , in 44 of 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decrease in the prevalence of children considered " cognitively disabled " or " learning disabled . " <p> What does this all mean ? First , we should be wary of " epidemic " claims and percentage increases based on administrative data . Second , we should not be surprised if school counts of children with autism continue increasing as they play catch-up to the number who truly have autism . <p> We want to be very clear : our results do not mean we have nothing to worry about . Scientific and clinical advances have improved our ability to identify autistic children and to differentiate their unique needs from those of children with other types of developmental disabilities . But schools and other social service systems are unable to keep pace with these changes or give the children the help they need . <p> Research to discover what causes autism , including possible environmental triggers , must be a top priority . However , autism is not purely a medical puzzle  --  as we invest in new ways of understanding autism , we have a corresponding responsibility to invest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social workers to provide up-to-date treatment for those with the condition and support services for their families . In the end , we should not have to deliver a verdict on whether there is an epidemic to fulfill these obligations . <p> #
