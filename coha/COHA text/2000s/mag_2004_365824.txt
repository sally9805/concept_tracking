Steve Jobs , ceo of Apple , argues that people wo n't watch movies on ( very ) small screens . Other companies are betting they will . So , will the new set of portable video players ( PVPS ) , or " video iPods , " that are flooding the market catch on like Apple 's music gizmo ? The Gmini400 from Archos , the French electronics company , speaks well for the pvp 's future : the smallest such device , it can store as much as 80 hours of video and 200,000 digital photos , and lets the user play video games  --  all on a 2.2-in. color lcd screen . At $399 , the Gmini400 can also carry 300 hours of music . " It 's a sleek , trendy product with a very attractive price point , " says Vamsi Sistla , an analyst at ABI Research . " But we think the market will trend towards nonentertainment uses , adding applications like videoconferencing . " So bosses could track workers on their portable players ? Perhaps the iPod is just fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
