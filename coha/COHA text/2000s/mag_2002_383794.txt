BASEBALL // Commissioner Bud Selig says the owners wo n't lock out the players . But there 's probably a better chance of the Expos winning the World Series than of the two sides reaching a new labor agreement before the start of spring training . After deftly suppressing the freeagent market , the owners simply might wait until the end of the season and declare a negotiating impasse , as they did in 1995 . Then , they would impose a new economic system based on the recommendations of the commissioner 's blue-ribbon panel on baseball economics . Their attempt at implementation in ' ' 95 failed when the National Labor Relations Board warned of an unfair labor practice charge . But the owners might fare better under a Republican administration than they did with the Democrats-although President George W. Bush , a former Rangers owner , is believed to be no fan of Selig . A 30-year history of conflict and mistrust gives credence to every doomsday scenario , but reasonable men could forge a settlement with little difficulty . The interlocking dynamics are complex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : A steeper luxury tax . Selig has proposed a 50 percent tax on the portions of payrolls that exceed $98 million . The union will not accept that high a rate , but the tax only will be effective if it slows spending . The rates from 1997-99-35 percent the first two seasons , 34 the third-accomplished little . The owners and players need to settle on a percentage in the 40s , give the clubs one season to adjust their payrolls and ensure that the threshold rises as revenues increase . Increased revenue sharing . Selig has proposed that teams put 50 percent of locally generated revenues in a pool to be redistributed equally to all teams . Makes sense in theory , but winning teams often parlay their success into additional revenue . Selig 's plan discourages such effort : The more revenue a team produces , the higher its contribution will be . The solution is to base each team 's contribution on projected , rather than actual , revenue . Say the Yankees ' projected revenue is $220 million , but their actual revenue in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would keep the extra money . The deeper problem is the inequity of franchise values . The Red Sox 's new owners paid a $660 million premium for the lucrative Boston market , but the value of their investment could decrease if their revenue-sharing contribution increases . It might be necessary to compensate such franchises , counterproductive as that seems . On the other hand , NFL franchise values keep rising , in part because extensive revenue sharing has made the league so strong . Minimum payroll . An absolute necessity if MLB is going to increase subsidies to low-revenue clubs . To achieve greater competitive balance , the high-revenue clubs must spend less and the low-revenue dubs more . The Twins received more than $19 million in revenue sharing in 2001 , but their $24.8 million payroll was the game 's lowest . It 's an outrage that they pocketed the money . They were able to turn a small profit , according to MLB . A revamped Rule 5 draft The competitive-balance draft that Selig proposed last winter was unrealistic . By allowing the bottom eight teams to select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied by the top eight , MLB would be penalizing success and rewarding failure . A draft with teams ranked by revenue also is unrealistic . High-revenue clubs would oppose it , viewing it as another form of revenue sharing . The best idea , then , is to rework the Rule 5 draft . As it stands now , the draft consists of players not on 40-man rosters . Teams pick in reverse order of their records , paying $50,000 per selection . Drafted players must remain in the majors the entire season or be offered back for $25,000 . The blue-ribbon panel suggested that , before the first round , each club with a bottom-eight record draft one player from one of the eight postseason dubs in the preceding year . Using records over a three-year period would better prevent teams from trying to maneuver their way into the draft . The rule that the players must remain on major league rosters should be eliminated , ensuring that low-revenue teams keep their picks . The teams that lose players should receive a fee for drafting and developing the talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the selecting clubs . A worldwide draft A revamped Rule 5 draft would help prevent high-revenue clubs from stockpiling minor league talent . A worldwide draft would enable low  --  revenue teams to select international players currently available only to the highest bidder . Some low-revenue teams would need to devote part of their revenue-sharing proceeds to international scouting . MLB also would allow the trading of draft choices . Why should n't a struggling team be allowed to trade the rights to a top pick for two or three players ? // The elimination of draft-pick compensation for free agents . Teams that lose top players receive two picks under the current system . With many free agents moving from one high-revenue club to another-Chan Ho Park , for example , went from the Dodgers to the Rangers  --  the wrong teams benefit . The link between free agency and the draft subjects the draft to collective bargaining , and the union opposes a cap on amateur bonuses . The union , however , could not practically oppose the elimination of compensation , which would amount to a free-market restriction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redirect the money to major league salaries . Rather than give $5 million to high school catcher Joe Mauer , the Twins could use the money to buy a proven major leaguer . These solutions are n't perfect , but they 're a start . There are enough lawyers on both sides to figure the rest out . Ready to make a power trip ? Go to **33;1123;TOOLONG for our MLB Power Poll .
