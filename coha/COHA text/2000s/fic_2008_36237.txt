Houses smaller than her dollhouse , fields stretching out and away . A pond tossing sunrays as she leans against the window , nose pressed to the glass . The plane seat rumbles . She feels it in her fingertips , in her teeth . <p> Daddy points . " Look there . " <p> And she sees it . Circle upon circle , living branches shaped like the inside of a seashell . Mesmerized , she follows the path with her eyes to the very center . <p> Daddy 's voice holds all the mystery in the world . " It 's a labyrinth . " <p> " Miss Young ? " <p> Tessa opened her heavy-lidded eyes to white light , beige walls . For a moment she 'd thought she was in-But no , it was the emergency room . She rotated her wrist and winced . Her neck burned , and she could almost feel the grip there still . She drew a ragged breath . <p> The nurse put a hand between her shoulder blades . " Let me help you up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a squeal of metal rings on rod . A man with a hawkish face and wiry hair entered . Dr. Brinkley . She 'd spoken with him ... how long ago ? <p> " You 've had some rest , Ms. Young ? " <p> She pressed her fingers to her temples and realized that somewhere between arriving and now they had sedated her . <p> " Sheriff Thomas is back , if you 're up to seeing him . " <p> Her chest quaked as her mind replayed the knife flashing , Smith 's stunned face . Would she have to identify him ? Could she bear it ? The sheriff entered , his pants and jacket shiny with rain . <p> " Is he ... is he dead ? " <p> " We went over the property , Ms. Young . There 's nothing to indicate a homicide . " <p> She had a moment of disconnect . What was he saying ? " You did n't find Smith ? " Her throat constricted . " That 's impossible . " <p> " The rain 's ruined what trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She jolted . " Someone attacked us . He stabbed Smith . " <p> " Someone not quite human . " <p> " I did n't say he was n't human , just grotesque , misshapen- " <p> " Pale and malformed , rotten teeth and milky eyes . Was n't that the description ? " <p> The description conjured up his image . " Yes . That 's what I saw . " <p> The sheriff slid out the pad he 'd jotted her words on before . " Yours was the only vehicle . " <p> She nodded . " I do n't know how he got there , but it is n't the first time . I thought I saw him weeks ago . " <p> " You said your boss was six-one , one-eighty . How would this small , malformed person with no transportation- " <p> " He must have hidden Smith , buried ... the body . " <p> " We searched the field and surrounding woods . " The sheriff looked her over slowly . " I 'll round up some dogs in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tell me what really happened ? " <p> She stared . " What do you mean ? " <p> " It appears you had a scuffle , but frankly , your story is ... " He spread his hands . " Not plausible . " <p> Her panic rose . " It 's not a story . I barely got away . Someone attacked us . He- " She fought the grief that raised the pitch of her voice . " Have you talked to Smith Chandler ? Can you tell me he 's alive ? " <p> The sheriff narrowed his eyes . " I 'm going to give you a while to come to grips with things , rethink your statement . Go home now , and we 'll talk in the morning . " <p> Dazed , she got up and went out , shivering , to the dark , wet street . Go home ? She was so far from home it made her head spin . Before driving her rental car back to the inn some miles out of town , she would try once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the covered entrance and speed-dialed her phone , needing someone to vouch for her , someone with credibility , to make them realize she could never imagine something like this . <p> " Dr. Brenner ? I 'm sorry to call so late , but I need you to talk to someone . " <p> " Hello , Tessa . Would that someone be Sheriff Thomas ? " <p> Her jaw dropped . " You spoke to him ? " <p> " You listed me as your emergency contact , and he was concerned . He said you were hysterical and incoherent . " <p> She brushed her hair back with shaky fingers . " Did he tell you why ? " <p> " He told me what you said . " <p> " You mean what happened . " <p> The pause said too much . " Tessa , this ... experience . You do see the similarity to your dreams . " <p> Her breath made a slow escape . <p> " All your classic elements-the maze , the fear of losing someone , abandonment . Even a monster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a labyrinth . And I can tell the difference between dreams and reality . " Her voice broke . " I saw someone stab Smith . " <p> " As his rejection stabbed you ? " <p> " I ... You ca n't think- " <p> " Listen to me , Tessa . It 's possible the scenario you 're describing is playing out like one of your dreams-or worse , that the real issues you 've been dealing with have pushed you to a breaking point . " <p> She started to shake . " Yes , I have dreams , terrible dreams . I also have a life . And I know the difference between what happens in my dreams and what happens in my life . " <p> " To a soldier with PTSD , bombs landing on his home seem very real . The mind is a powerful thing . " <p> She closed her eyes . " This is not in my mind . " <p> " The condition can cause a person to overreact to a perceived threat or injury . " <p> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come back to Cedar Grove . Let me evaluate you ... before you 're charged with a crime you may not have been able to control . " <p> " You ca n't believe I would hurt Smith . " <p> " I think it more likely you 've broken with reality . " <p> " What about that I 'm telling the truth ? " <p> His silence stung . She hung up and clutched the phone to her throat . Fear and dread loomed like monsters , but this was real . She knew it . Only ... <p> With trembling fingers , she dialed another number . <p> Wet and shivering , Tessa dragged herself up the inn stairs to her room . She locked the door and window , dragged the wing chair over to the door and propped it beneath the knob . Enfolded by the soft yellow walls and cozy furnishings , she surrendered to the grief . Smith was gone , and the hurt overwhelmed her . Hurt and fear . Every creak , every muffled noise set her heart pounding . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eyes of his murderer were etched on the back of her eyelids . She had not dreamed or imagined him . <p> Perhaps she dozed , for she followed endless paths in endless circles until the cold morning light woke her . She opened her eyes and sat up . The sedative had left her brain filmy . Had Dr. Brenner authorized or even prescribed the medication ? She had been hysterical , running for her life after seeing Smith fall . <p> Pain came , as hard and relentless as the rain outside . She wished she could believe nothing had happened , but Smith would have answered her call if he could . She checked her watch . Last night she had collapsed in her clothes , but she tore them off now and changed into clean khakis and a T-shirt . Her wrist throbbed as she ran a brush through her hair and pulled it into a ponytail , impatient with each minute that kept her from answers . <p> At the station , she found Sheriff Thomas conferring with a deputy . The sheriff finished his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cleared his throat . " Too much rain to go out there , Ms. Young . Dogs wo n't pick up a scent , and the ground 's been ruined for footprints . " He wiped his mouth . " So why do n't we get the real story , now that you 're settled down . " <p> " Smith Chandler was stabbed in the labyrinth field , just past the old foundation . I saw him fall . I saw him lying in the rain . " <p> " Where 's the knife ? What did you do with the body ? " <p> Her chest constricted . The red sags under the sheriff 's eyes and his drooping jowls gave him the look of a bloodhound , but he was on the wrong scent . <p> " We searched everything , Ms. Young , including your weird crop circles or whatever you 're cutting out there . " Sheriff Thomas cleared the gruff edge from his throat . " This will go down so much better if you just come clean . " <p> " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm going to find out . Until then , it 's probably best you do n't leave the county . " <p> Returning to the inn , she closed herself into the room , anger rising . Dr. Brenner had fed the sheriff 's suspicion instead of giving her credibility . So what if this event had connections to her dreams ? She was a specialist in labyrinths . Her work always overlapped the subconscious elements that haunted her sleep . <p> She went and stood at the rain-streaked window . Could anyone truly believe she 'd killed Smith ? The thought that she may have had a psychotic break and imagined it all shook her , but if there was no body and no evidence of murder , then Smith was alive , somewhere . Oh , please-let it have all been in her head . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
