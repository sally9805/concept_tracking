<p> BREAK 'S OVER <p> SERENA RETURNS TO COURT <p> Serena Williams is about to find out whether she is ready to compete once again on the tennis court . <p> The former world No. 1 , whose last tournament action was a loss in the Australian Open in January , is scheduled for a first-round match Tuesday in the Western &; Southern Financial Group Women 's Open in Mason , Ohio . <p> I honestly just needed a mental break , " she said last week on a <p> conference call . I was going through a lot of stuff in my life , besides surgery and including surgery . <p> It was a lot  --  a lot that not everyone will understand or ever know . " <p> Williams , whose ranking has fallen to No. 140 , has had to deal with the after-effects of surgery to her left knee in August 2003 . The Ohio <p> tournament figures to serve as a tuneup for the U.S. Open , which <p> begins Aug. 28 . <p> I needed to take time to clear my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to do , which is play tennis . It 's what I like to do best , " she said . <p> My goals  --  I 've never said them out loud . I just expect to do what I do best , and I think I play tennis best . " <p> FAST TIMES <p> JONES HAS NEWFOUND MOTIVE <p> American sprinter Marion Jones has something of a <p> one-track mind . <p> So running a 10.91 in the 100 meters at the Golden Gala meet Friday in Rome was satisfying <p> because it was her best time in four years . It also was second-best to Jamaica 's Sherone Simpson , who posted a 10.82 . <p> I ran my seasonal best , " Jones , 30 , said . But I am a competitor . I want to win . <p> Sherone got me fair and square . Everyone 's getting better and faster . The times show that . " <p> Jones , who won three golds at the 2000 Olympic Games , has a career best of 10.65 , which she ran in 1998 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth to a son in June 2003 . <p> Sherone had a technically sound race from start to finish . I was disappointed with the technical aspects of the last stages of my race , " Jones said . Losing will probably give me some motivation to come back and beat her . <p> Losing has given me the <p> motivation that perhaps I did n't have before . " <p> MONDAY MEANDERINGS <p> FALL CLASSIC : SOX BOPPERS TOPPLED <p> For classic confrontations , how about New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera vs. the heart of the White Sox ' lineup in the ninth inning Sunday . You could n't ask for anything much better . Except possibly scoring at least a couple of runs to tie the game  --  if you 're rooting for the Sox  --  after the first two batters reached base in the top of the ninth . Next time , how about maybe Kyle Farnsworth vs. the heart of the Sox ' lineup . <p> uNow that the White Sox have been swept in the three-game <p> series over the weekend at Yankee Stadium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned about holding off the Yanks for a wild-card berth . <p> Unless the Sox can sweep the Tigers in a series beginning <p> Tuesday in Motown and refocus on the American League Central race . Given their results vs. the Red Sox and Yanks , the AL East is not where the Sox want to be . <p> - Just because the Sox recalled Sean Tracey on Sunday to replace Cliff Politte in the bullpen does n't mean Tracey was n't sent down in the first place for failing to hit a batter in retaliation as baseball 's code of misconduct ( if not the team 's manager himself ) dictated . <p> - The Yankees winning without outfielders Gary Sheffield and Hideki Matsui in the lineup is not so much a credit to the managerial mastery of Joe Torre as it is to the depth of talent ( and the <p> accompanying payroll ) that the team has . In case anyone wants to draw comparisons to a team such as  --  oh , let 's say  --  the Cubs . <p> - Cubs right-hander Greg Maddux to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Las Vegas ? Given his status , you have to think Maddux will go somewhere that will enable him to be close to first place and the postseason . <p> - Cubs manager Dusty Baker on the hot seat ? Despite his status , you have to think for Sunday 's game at Wrigley Field , everyone was . <p> PRETTY GOOD <p> SABATINI INDUCTED INTO HALL <p> Before Maria Sharapova , before Anna Kournikova  --  in an era when a woman 's appearance on a tennis court was appreciated but not celebrated to the extent that tends to occur with contemporary beauties  --  there was Gabriela Sabatini . <p> As an Argentine teen , she reached the French Open <p> semifinals . When she captured the U.S. Open at 20 , she became the first Argentine woman to win a Grand Slam event . <p> At 26 , her career ended because of the lingering presence of injury and the lack of desire . <p> At 36 , she was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame on Saturday in Newport , R.I. <p> Also inducted were Patrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the fourth-youngest inductee behind Tracy Austin ( 29 ) , Bjorn Borg ( 31 ) and Hana Mandlikova ( 32 ) . <p> To end my tennis career this way is the best thing that could have happened , " Sabatini told the New York Times . To be part of tennis history , to have my name going in there , it 's big , big . " <p> Sabatini has gone on to a successful business career with a line of perfumes and assorted endorsements , among other pursuits . <p> I was not enjoying tennis that much , " she said of the end of her career . It was not making me happy anymore . Tennis is a lonely sport . There 's much good in it . It gives you an opportunity to travel and to get to know places and people . It opens your mind . But it is still just you . I 'm 100 percent sure I made the right decision . Now I have the freedom to do all the things I do , and I 'm glad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I wanted to do : to be the best I could be , to win a Grand Slam tournament . So I 'm satisfied . " <p> With the chance to run a non-gratuitous photo of Sabatini , Quick Hits is similarly satisfied . <p> BLUE MAN DUPE <p> O 'S FORCED TO RETURN BOBBLEHEADS <p> Fans of Baltimore Orioles second baseman Brian Roberts are feeling a little blue . <p> Mainly because his bobblehead day , scheduled for Saturday at Camden Yards , was lacking Brian Roberts bobbleheads . Mainly <p> because his bobblehead had dark skin  --  with a bluish tint , " the Baltimore Sun reported . <p> The biggest objection we had with this doll was the coloring , " Orioles spokesman Bill Stetka told the paper . I have not seen it , but I had it described to me as looking like a Smurf . " <p> As if that 's a bad thing . <p> So instead , the first 20,000 fans 21 and older received a voucher redeemable for the correctly colored version after Sept. 1 . <p> The original prototype of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Changes were made with the team approving <p> after seeing a computer image . <p> We 've learned a lesson to not look just at a JPEG instead of <p> actually looking at the final product , " Stetka said . The original prototype that we got he was too pale , like a light cream color , which is n't Brian 's skin tone either . " <p> I never saw it , " Roberts said of the bobblehead . I heard , that 's about it . It 's not that big a deal , whatever . " <p> The reaction indicating Roberts is not thin-skinned  --  regardless of color . <p> SLICE OF LIFE <p> CELEB PULLS OFF EXPLODING GOLF BALL TRICK <p> Golf not only can be a humbling sport , it can have a shattering effect . <p> Take the case of Matthew Settle ( below ) . <p> The actor who starred in HBO 's Band of Brothers " series was competing in the American Century Celebrity Golf <p> Championship on Friday in Stateline , Nev. , when he sliced a 5-iron on the par-3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So bad that the ball found water  --  on Lake Tahoe . <p> Actually , the ball found a boat on the lake . Specifically , the windshield of the boat . Settle 's shot broke two windows on the craft . <p> That will go down in history , " said Settle , a novice at the sport . I do n't think I 've ever hit anything other than a tree . " <p> We had been sort of joking around about it beforehand that there might be a chance of us getting hit , " said Mark White , who was in the boat alongside No. 17 . Then my buddy said , Look out ! Incoming ! ' And we heard the glass shatter . It just exploded . We could n't believe it . " <p> Neither could Settle 's playing partner John O'Hurley . <p> I 've seen broken windows on golf courses before , " the actor said , but never on a boat .
