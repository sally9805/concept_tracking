<p> He does n't smoke , does n't drink , does n't like going out to dinner , does n't have a large wardrobe , does n't have a lot of good friends , and does n't speak the languages of the people he 's going to govern . In fact , he does n't say much at all . In so many ways , Joseph Kabila , the newly chosen president of the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) , is not his father . Whether that will make him a better - or worse - leader remains to be seen . The shy , eldest son of slain President Laurent Kabila 's 10 children is expected to be inaugurated as president today . He takes the helm of a nation as large as Western Europe and as fractured by war as any place on the planet . Born during his father 's years in exile in East Africa - according to two separate versions either in 1968 or 1972 - the young Kabila spent most of his life outside the DRC . He completed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training in Rwanda in 1995 , and had just begun university in Uganda in 1996 when his father called him to help in the rebel war against then-President Mobutu Sese Seko . After Mr. Mobutu was toppled , Joseph Kabila was sent by his father to China for more military training , returning from there three months later and soon promoted to the rank of major-general . Since his 1997 return , Joseph Kabila has served as chief of the armed forces . " He is and always was a military man , " says Gen. Yavh Nawej , one of the DRC 's top Army commanders who is close to Kabila . " The new president knows about discipline and knows about action . He is a man of few words - true , but all great men are such ... He is accepted by the military because of his abilities , and I am sure of his capacity to rule . " Asked whether the young Kabila will be accepted by the people of DRC , the general 's eyes open wide , and he emphasizes , " Absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not as comfortable with Swahili , according to his cousin , Lungange Juvenal-Noblesse . Lingala , the tribal language that is spoken by most Congolese , is foreign to him . " He used to speak English to his father even when there were non-English speakers around , " attests Mr. Juvenal-Noblesse . Kabila 's best friend , say those who know him , is a Tanzanian businessman known only as Jimmie , who comes to visit often . " He 's a shy guy , Joseph , " says another friend , Lubunga Bya'obe , who has known the young Kabila for four years . " We never really go out together . Mostly he is working , or when relaxing , he is just at home watching American basketball on TV , listening to the BBC , or working on the stationary bike ... When Jimmie comes to visit , they have a good time joking around and laughing , but otherwise , I have rarely seen him letting loose . " To let off steam , says Mr. Bya'obe , Kabila goes for long drives in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get in his Jeep Cherokee , and drive off to live in one of the official palaces . Until today , he has been living in a modest villa in the downtown military compound he shares with the heads of DRC 's allied Zimbabwe and Angolan forces . Although not married , Kabila lives with his girlfriend - a young , attractive woman named Olive from Gome , whom he reportedly met when she came with her aunt to complain that the Army had requisitioned their family home . The two have a child together , one-year-old Josephine . Kabila has a twin sister , Jane , who is studying journalism in the US ; and one blood brother , Saide . They are widely believed to be the children of Kabila and a woman from Rwanda 's Tutsi minority . Their mother , Mrs. Sifa Maanya - one of the late Kabila 's three wives - lives in the marble palace to this day , but has never spoken to the public or the press . In a country where tribal politics is everything , and where the Rwandan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumors that one is a Tutsi can be harmful . The government adamantly denies the rumors , claiming that Kabila 's mother is from the Bango-Bango tribe . Little has been seen of Kabila in the days since his father was killed . He has met privately with representatives of various social , commercial , and religious groups in the country , as well as with foreign diplomats . However , he has yet to address the people . The people , in turn , seem not to know what to expect . As Laurent Kabila 's coffin was driven through the streets of Kinshasa Sunday , many cried out for the " Mzee , " or the elder statesman . But none mouthed his son 's name . " We do n't know him at all , and we do n't know what sort of leader he will be , " said one bystander , Laetitia Lakumbu . " We are not against him , but he will wait and see . " Some within Kinshasa , however , seem less patient and are more blunt in their criticism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a kingdom , and that it was wrong to pass the leadership to the son of the former president . " As capable as he is , Congo is not a monarchy , " says Ngwarsungu Chiwengo of the Christian Social Democratic Party , one of the myriad of opposition parties suppressed by the elder Kabila 's regime . It 's not a monarchy , but this vast , resource-rich land certainly has a history of being run by strongmen . Arguably the biggest bully of all was King Leopold II of Belgium , who used the Congo Free State as his personal fiefdom and whose brutal reign led to the deaths of 10 million people , according to historians . Soon after its 1960 independence , Mobutu came to power in a coup . Laurent Kabila 's rebel army ended Mobutu 's 32-year repressive regime in 1997 , but introduced a government just as corrupt and brutal . Members of the government , although some of them may well have designs on the position themselves , have until now displayed a united front . They say that considering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to choose a new president whom all could trust to assure continuity and calm in the country . " You can not deal with the assassination of the president in the morning , and have elections in the afternoon , " said Minister of Justice Mwenze Kongolo . According to military sources , however , several of the ministers are anxiously waiting to make their own bids for power - and the ministers would not have agreed to the installation of Kabila had it not been for the insistence of the military . While reportedly not particularly loved by the common soldiers , Kabila is well respected by the generals - many of whom owe their jobs and thus their allegiance to him . It was the generals , according to these sources , who demanded that Kabila be appointed president . " And over here , it is the military that decides these things , " said one source . " Ambition is not missing here , but it is no crime to dream of becoming president , " says Juvenal-Noblesse . " However , one must also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country now , besides Joseph Kabila , who has that . We are a democracy , yes , however legitimacy comes in many forms . And in this case , it has come from the support of the military and the acquiescence of the government . If the people choose to say no , that is a different question - but that has not happened .
