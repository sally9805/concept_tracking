Section : testaments In our quest for the wholeness that only Christ can give , a blind beggar leads the way . <p> WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF JESUS SHOWED up at your door today and made you whole ? It 's not a question most of us are prepared to answer because , despite all of our churchgoing and creed-saying , most of us do n't expect to encounter Jesus anytime soon . This could be due to a lack of faith , or more simply to a lack of imagination . <p> But chances are the people who did meet Jesus and were healed along the way were no more prepared for the event than we might be . For us mortals , accustomed to pain and loss and ailment and heartbreak as part of the scheme of things , the idea of being made whole later today can seem highly improbable , to say the least . Yet when we profess our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ , we are saying that miracles do break into time , divine power does walk with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the plan . <p> The thought is appealing , because we all have something in our lives that needs healing . That sore shoulder that 's been nagging for weeks , or that ache that has persisted in the family for years . Things are not the way they should be : not in our bodies , our relationships , or our world at large . We need someone  --  Someone  --  to mend the torn hole in our ozone , to bind the nations together in peace , to bring justice to the poor and hope to those who live in fear . <p> With no trouble at all most of us could write up an extensive to-do list for God , should the divine choose to show up on our humble doorstep with healing power in hand . Our friends ' marriages are crumbling . Members of our family are sick . People we know ca n't find work . Someone we love suffers from depression , grief , rage , or loss of faith . God , if you 're not doing anything this afternoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With scripture as our witness , God can , does , and has chosen to do just that . In the stories of the New Testament , we see Jesus healing people with just a touch , a word , or an act of will . Lepers are restored , their skin like a newborn 's . Those with seizures are quieted , the paralyzed regain mobility , the blind see , the grieving parent has his child brought back to life . The bottom line of the gospels is , Jesus is the hope of the hopeless . If you think all is lost , guess again . Jesus has come to find what is lost ! <p> BUT WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL OF THESE FOLKS AFTER THEY are made whole ? The question lingers , because scripture rarely tells us anything beyond the moment of healing . In our modern day , the media would follow these walking miracles around , stick microphones in their faces and ask : " So how does it feel to be brought back from the dead ? " " What 's it like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Where are you going , now that you can see the road ahead of you ? .... What will you do with the new life you 've been given ? " <p> But these healed biblical figures never make the talk-show circuit nor do they write their autobiographies : Demoniac No More/or Lame Man Dancing . All we get are glimpses of the initial reactions of the newly healed . Simon 's feverish mother gets up from her bed and waits on her guests . A paralytic picks up his mat and walks away without a word . One leper in 10 remembers to return long enough to give thanks for the miracle . When Jesus casts out demons from some possessed men , the entire region turns out fearfully to beg Jesus to go away . <p> Rarely is there an exchange between Jesus and the healed person after the event , and often we are told nothing about the response of the recipient of such good news . Generally , the only report we get is the amazement of the crowd around the action . The restored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't we follow them home , back to the arms of their astonished families , back to the long-abandoned workshops , back to the temple to give praise to God ? It would be instructive to learn that the once-deaf man became a musician , or that the former leper stopped drowning her pain in drink after her isolation ended and she could once more hold her children . <p> We 'd like to know that the two men formerly known as blind met often in the late afternoon and silently watched the beauty of the sunset together , weeping . Or that the boy once possessed by an evil spirit grew up to lead prayer at the local synagogue . Jairus ' daughter , dead at age 12 , sat up , ate something , and resumed her life long enough to see her great-grandchildren . But as it stands , none of these stories are made available to us . <p> MAYBE , HOWEVER , NOT KNOWING IS BETTER THAN KNOWING . Because there are no guarantees when it comes to the behavior of humans , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no way assures us that they lived out their lives in gratitude . Do n't we know people who have been given much and do n't seem to be aware of it ? <p> It could be that the man healed of deafness went back to his old haunts with his cronies , shut out the tedious sounds of his wife and children and eventually grew as deaf as before . The leper may have been healed only skin-deep , remaining isolated by her dependence on wine even though she returned to the bosom of her family . <p> Maybe the men once blind were also steeped in moral ignorance , and used their regained sight to be on the lookout for opportunities to cheat their neighbors . Maybe the boy who once fell prey to an evil spirit was eventually overcome by seven more , and his last state was worse than the first . Jairus ' daughter , remembering nothing of being dead , may never have noticed the wonder of being alive during all those long years ahead of her . <p> Being made whole , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . How we respond to the gift we receive is just as important , if not more so . <p> Which is why the story of blind Bartimaeus stands out among the New Testament healing narratives . Like many before him , Bartimaeus lived a life troubled by unmet need . He sat by the road outside the city of Jericho as a familiar sight to travelers : the Jericho beggar . Every day , the most he could hope for was charity from strangers . What he could also expect was to be abused , sometimes verbally and occasionally physically , by those who found his presence distasteful or his vulnerability alluring . <p> And then one day he had more to hope for . On that day , he overheard in the excited chatter of passersby that Jesus of Nazareth was coming down this road . <p> Being a person with nothing to lose , Bartimaeus raised his voice and shouted repeatedly , " Jesus , son of David , have pity on me ! " People told him to shut up , and maybe even swatted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to lose this one chance at wholeness . <p> When Jesus heard the unfamiliar address , " son of David , " he stopped in the road . What a rare act of faith this unseen voice was making ! Someone recognized the saving significance of the house of David in him , that he was the bearer of God 's covenant and the promised messiah . " Call him , " Jesus ordered . The crowds complied in haste . <p> When summoned , Bartimaeus makes a second act of faith . He casts aside his cloak , which a beggar used for collecting alms from his benefactors . Bartimaeus , called by Jesus , did n't expect to be needing alms anymore . He was stepping forward into a whole new life , and he knew it in every fiber of his being . <p> " What do you want me to do for you ? " Jesus asked plainly . <p> " Master , I want to see ! " Bartimaeus replied just as simply . <p> " Go your way ; your faith has saved you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go his way . Instead , he went the way Jesus was going . As scripture tells us , the blind man instantly received his sight and chose to follow Jesus " on the way . " The phrase used here implies that he followed all the way , to the cross itself . <p> In Mark 's gospel , the restoration of Bartimaeus is the last healing Jesus performs . Next Jesus turns to Jerusalem to face his final week of triumph and treachery . Bartimaeus is a late follower , entering the story long after the glory days of popular preaching and nonstop miracles , inheriting a short and difficult road of discipleship that leads in less than a week to Calvary . <p> Is this what he expected to see with his newly opened eyes ? Could he have guessed that the man who gave him sight would soon be denounced , arrested , beaten , condemned , and executed ? How could he turn his gaze to the cross and watch the one he had so recently chosen to follow suffer and die ? Did Bartimaeus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and to return to the darkness ? <p> SCRIPTURE TELLS US THAT BARTIMAEUS ASKED FOR HIS SIGHT , and deliberately chose to follow . He alone , of all who received the gift of healing from Jesus , used his newfound vision to become a disciple and eyewitness . This elevates him above the role that most healed characters play as signs of the coming kingdom , all the way to role model for those who seek the wholeness that only Christ can give . Bartimaeus made a unique choice and claims a singular place in the gospels as a result . <p> In the end , as Jesus pointed out so many times in his teaching , it is not the sight of the eyes that saves , nor the blindness of the eyes that makes us lost . Those who recognize Jesus , like Bartimaeus the Jericho beggar , are granted a vision far more perceptive than that of the Pharisees , whose eyes are clear but whose hearts are darkened . <p> Bartimaeus recognized Jesus as messiah of God and a teacher worth following before he ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely for three years and never saw his Lord . The religious leaders studied scripture all their lives and did n't know the Word of God when it walked into town . The eyes of faith , we might conclude , offer the only sight that counts . <p> And it is with this sight that we discover an answer to the original question : What would you do if Jesus came to the door today and made you whole ? Laugh and weep , perhaps ; dance and sing ; fall down in worship or cover his hands with grateful kisses . But after you offer your response of joy and thanksgiving , do n't forget to fall in behind Jesus as he walks further down the road . Wherever he 's going is a better place than any of us are standing right now . <p> The blind Bartimaeus : Mark 10:46-52 .
