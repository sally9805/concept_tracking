A high-performance cross-country bike used to be , by definition , a hardtail . But thanks to advances in suspension designs and platform air shocks that filter out pedaling forces , we 've watched full-suspension bikes rise to the level of viable XC performers-one unmatched for fun and in danger of making the hardtail obsolete . Still , as good as the best full-suspension XC bikes are , sometimes you ca n't beat the simplicity , weight and climbing prowess of a top-shelf hardtail . No matter which you prefer , you 'll find what you 're looking for in one of these four machines . LITESPEED Sewanee $6,495 IT ROCKS : For flying over the ( sorta ) rough stuff at full cry BUT NOT IF : You think " full-suspension " means plush and comfortable It does n't take long to realize just how single-purpose the Sewanee is . One fast lap around your favorite training loop and you 'll feel how the suspension dulls the spike of waterbars and slick roots , and wonder how a full-suspension bike can accelerate so swiftly . But one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder where all that suspension went . Make no mistake , with a mere 60mm ( 2.5 in. ) of rear-wheel travel this bike has its own agenda : going fast . XC style . Of course , as is Litespeed 's way , functionality can also be a thing of pure beauty . Just look at the cold-worked 3AI/2.5V titanium frame with its Geometrically Enhanced Tubing ( each tube is shaped for optimum force resistance and strength ) , machined ti suspension links and sealed pivot bearings . Litespeed uses what it calls a CLR linkage system . It 's designed to have the shortest shock throw possible for a given travel resulting in a balanced shock-to-wheel travel ratio , also known as a linear rate ( as opposed to a rising or falling rate ) . This eliminates the need for special valving to accommodate a suspension that ramps up near full compression or , worse , blows through the middle of the travel . You also do n't have to set air pressure to patch the soft or hard point . Once the shock 's air pressure was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overly stiff initial action . All said and done , with a Fox air shock the lightweight system lets Litespeed build a frame that hits the scales at just a smidge under 4.5 pounds . We tested a M/L , a size that Litespeed says is useful for riders who feel that a medium is too short and a large is too tall . By lengthening the top tube and going with a slightly longer front-center ( compared to the medium ) , you get an aggressive , stretched-out position that complements the Sewanee 's steepish angles . It 's tough to fault the Sewanee in its own arena : The bike is rocket fast , especially on rough , stutter-bump trails and fire roads . Go to the steeps of ski resorts like Mt . Snow or Mammoth and the bike still performs , climbing aggressively enough that you can stay with your hardtail-mounted competition . WEIGHT : 24.16 lb . ( M/L ) SIZES : S. M.
