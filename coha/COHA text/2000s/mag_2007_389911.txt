Western architects have grand plans for helping China solve its expanding environmental crisis . But the world 's dirtiest country already has the power to clean up all on its own . ZHAO QINGHAO , the first resident of China 's first eco-village , is a 58-year-old polio victim whose left leg is twisted at a 60-degree angle below the knee . He walks with a cane fashioned out of PVC tubing and smokes a pipe and the occasional enormous , self-rolled cigarette . His wife , Yi Shiqin , who is 50 , is mentally disabled and has a speech impediment . Their family is one of the poorest in a poor community , and their new eco-home has not helped . They have no heat and no water . They have a gas meter but no gas . They have no neighbors on their deserted street , no room to grow corn in their tiny garden , no place in their yard for the cashmere goats that once provided a third of their income . As temperatures dropped last winter , the bio-gasification plant intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piled up waist-deep outside their door , they locked themselves in their bedroom because the rest of the house was too cold . Zhao took a pickax and hacked a hole into the wall to create a makeshift fireplace , where they burned wood from the local forest . China 's eco-revolution was n't meant to go this way , and Zhao and Yi had n't meant to be eco-pioneers . But their old house , a stone structure Zhao had lived in since the 1960s , was gutted by an electrical fire in May 2006 The local government gave their $2,600 in restitution money to the developer of the eco-village . The couple had little choice . Along with their former neighbors , whose house had also burned , they became the sole residents of Huangbaiyu New Village  --  model inhabitants of a model community that was supposed to prove that China could grow up green . Five days after Zhao and Yi moved in , a convoy of black sedans pulled into Huangbaiyu : a delegation of officials and journalists from Beijing , here to witness the village 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-dozen eco-cities , megalopolises and capitals of pollution I visited this spring to gauge whether China can engineer itself out of environmental catastrophe  --  were drawn by none other than William McDonough , the celebrated former " Green Dean " of the University of Virginia 's architecture school and godfather of America 's sustainable-design movement . In 1996 McDonough was the first , and so far only , individual to win the White House award for green design ; the title of his 2002 book , Cradle to Cradle , which refers to an environmentally harmless cycle of manufacture and reuse , has become a sustainability buzz term . Huangbaiyu , in far northeastern China , was the first development project by the China-U.S . Center for Sustainable Development , a nonprofit McDonough started with Deng Nan , the daughter of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping . McDonough 's drawings depicted a beautiful teardrop of a village filling a forested valley . Its homes were to feature solar panels , eco-bricks made of hay and clay , and southern exposure to maximize sunlight . The project would pay for itself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to trade in their former homes . The old dwellings would revert to fields , and Huangbaiyu 's farmable area would grow ( how this would ever make sense economically was never made clear ) . Like Dongtan , the much larger eco-city now taking form on the margins of Shanghai and another stop on my tour , Huangbaiyu was the subject of glowing press coverage . The local entrepreneur selected to build the new homes , Dai Xiaolong , who is also the village chief , took out nearly $1 million in loans to pay for construction . Convinced that Huangbaiyu would be famous around the world , the first of a wave of green cities across China , he also took out thousands of trademarks  --  Huangbaiyu Windows , Huangbaiyu Motors , Huangbaiyu Refrigerators  --  and waited to cash in . I set out for Huangbaiyu on a sunny spring day along with my friend and translator Flora . We took a taxi from the regional capital , Shenyang , and followed a newly built expressway to a newly paved road . The new village 's 42 homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in a grid , like a piece of half-built American suburbia here in the Chinese countryside . Very little of Dai 's interpretation of McDonough 's plans was obviously " eco . " Shannon May , an anthropologist from the University of California at Berkeley who spent 18 months living in Huangbaiyu , told me that Dai  --  who had little experience as a builder , let alone a green builder  --  had neither the expertise nor the support to fulfill McDonough 's vision . " It was like the Chia Pet model of development , " she said . " Just add water . " Because Dai was short on funds , only one house had a solar panel . A dozen workers mixed cement near what was to be the revamped bio-gasification plant , which had a hopeful coat of green paint . Two more workers , here to water a few meager strips of grass , were sitting on metal buckets , drunk at 11 in the morning . One sprang up and kissed me on the cheek . " Americans , you hug them , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed . It would have been nicer had he shaved . We toured old Huangbaiyu , a beautiful collection of stone homes where ducks waddled down the main street and villagers plowed fields with pairs of horses , and after lunch we headed the few hundred yards back to the new village , where Zhao and Yi soon arrived home from the faraway plot where they had been planting corn . Their hands were stained red from pesticides . " Come into my home , " Zhao said . " Come , come . " He showed us the fireplace he 'd cut into the wall , and his freshly tilled vegetable patch , where he was planting beans and cucumbers in a space a fifth the size of his old garden . " This project is a waste of money , " he said . " These houses are suitable for factory workers , not country people . " He handed us a couple cans of Snow beer and cracked one open for himself . " Chinese people think this beer is only half as good , because in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But I think this is pretty good beer . " THE FIRST THING to understand is that China 's problem is our own . For every Chinese peasant who moves to the city  --  400 million are expected to do so in the next two decades , the greatest urban migration in history  --  the world loses someone who lives off the land and gains someone who lives on the grid . This year , for the first time ever , the planet has more urbanites than rural residents , a shift attributable in large part to China and its dozens of million-person cities you 've never heard of . City dwellers in the developing world use at least three times as much energy as those in the country . The richer they get  --  the richer China gets  --  the more they use . China 's economic boom , a 10 percent increase in GDP every year , is twice that of America 's at the height of the dot-com era and shows no signs of relenting . Half of the world 's new buildings go up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. highway system in a decade . It adds the electricity use of Norway , 102 gigawatts , to its power grid every year and builds the equivalent of three coal-fired electricity plants every week ( not one , as is usually reported ) . Last year , it produced 2.3 billion metric tons of coal , 40 percent of the world 's total and more than the U.S. , Russia and India combined . There is no dirtier form of energy than coal , and there is no dirtier coal than China 's . Few of the country 's plants have sulfur scrubbers , making China the world 's largest emitter of sulfur dioxide , which causes the acid rain that falls on a third of Chinese territory . Last year , the State Environmental Protection Agency ( SEPA ) recalculated the country 's GDP to account for environmental costs  --  and reported a 3 percent reduction ( others estimate 8 to 15 percent ) . That same year , 4,700 people were killed in coal-mining accidents . In February , South Korea suffered two weeks of toxic dust storms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar cloud of pollution was spotted floating over the Pacific toward North America see " Endangered Orbits , " page 64 . U.S. soil is filled with Chinese particulates ; roughly 50 percent of our mercury comes from foreign , mostly Chinese , coal plants . But while China 's smog becomes our problem and its petroleum companies buy up Africa 's oil fields and its livestock eat up the soy that deforests the Amazon , what the world really fears is China 's coal-powered greenhouse emissions . China was responsible for 8 percent of the world 's carbon dioxide emissions in 1980 By 2004 , it was responsible for 18 percent . In April the International Energy Agency 's chief economist declared that China would surpass the U.S. as the world 's top emitter of greenhouse gases  --  not in 2009 or 2010 , as previously thought , but this year . It may already have happened . Also in April , when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA would have to do more to regulate auto emissions , President Bush used China to excuse his inaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China will produce greenhouse gases that will offset anything we do , " he argued . Meanwhile , China 's official response to a report released in February by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which has since recommended that urgent action be taken to prevent catastrophic climate change , was that developed countries ' responsibility for global warming " can not be shirked . " As a developing country , China should not be expected to wholly sacrifice its growth , said spokeswoman Jiang Yu . " It must be pointed out that climate change has been caused by the long-term historic emissions of developed countries and their high per-capita emissions . " The simple fact is that if the world 's emissions are not reduced , global warming will flood Florida as surely as it melts China 's Himalayas . Our fates are intertwined , and ever more so as China becomes the world 's factory . Every minute of every day in 2005 , American consumers bought $463,200 worth of Chinese goods  --  a number that has undoubtedly risen as the trade deficit has jumped from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $19 billion today . Chinese firms are blamed for deforesting tropical Southeast Asia , but 70 percent of the wood imported goes into furniture bound for Europe and North America . Energy-intensive heavy industry such as steel production is migrating from the developed world to China 's eastern coast . A 2005 study by Bin Shui and Robert Harris of Colorado 's National Center for Atmospheric Research determined that from 1997 to 2003 , China-U.S. trade increased global CO2 emissions by 720 million metric tons . Some 7 to 14 percent of China 's emissions resulted from exports to American customers ; had the goods been produced here , our national CO2 emissions would be up to 6 percent higher , and the U.S. would still be the top greenhouse emitter in the world . Simply put , this is our pollution too  --  we 've just outsourced it to China . It seems only right , then , that the world 's great planners and architects and environmentalists are landing in droves in Beijing and Shanghai , hoping to help China engineer itself out of a crisis , to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world realizes that its environmental future is tied to China 's , the more experts will come . The question , ultimately , is whether all their grand efforts will make any difference at all . ON A FRIDAY a week before my trip to Huangbaiyu , 200 of the planet 's top green architects , engineers and urban planners were packed into a hall at Shanghai 's Tongji University , listening , rapt , to a talk by Peter Head of the global design firm Arup . The subject was the eco-city of Dongtan , an Arup-led project 25 miles away on the Yangtze River 's Chongming Island , the Shanghai municipality 's last patch of undeveloped land . " Dongtan is a specific project for a specific place .... But the world is reacting to it , " he said . " It 's a vision for how we can transform cities into something better . " A soft-spoken man in his early 60s with a gray mustache and a penchant for occasional Britishisms such as " jiggery-pokery , " Head was something of a star in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is an engineer and bridge-builder who has spent eight years on London 's Sustainable Development Commission . He had a hand in imposing on London drivers the 8 ( $16 ) congestion fee that has made the city notably quieter and freer of traffic ( New York is considering a similar system ) , and now he is creating what many hope will be the world 's first true eco-city . One PowerPoint slide showed him in the company of British prime minister Tony Blair and Chinese president Hu Jintao , signing the 2005 agreement to build Dongtan , a project that , unlike little Huangbaiyu , is being pushed by the highest levels of the Chinese government . Head described Dongtan as not just a city but an ecosystem . Planning was an exercise in integrated thinking  --  " integrated urbanism , " as Arup 's literature calls it . Transportation was considered at the same time as health care , because in the big picture , one affects the other : The more walking and the less air pollution , the healthier the people , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are banned , Dongtan 's office buildings will save on air-conditioning : Workers wo n't mind opening windows to cool down their offices if traffic noise is absent and the air is clean . Head 's planning team includes economists , water engineers , graphic designers , property consultants , " cultural specialists " and a philosopher  --  an approach far more multidisciplinary than the one that birthed Huangbaiyu . He showed a slide of his Chinese team 's " barrel principle " of city development : an image of a wooden barrel that holds only as much water as its shortest rib allows . The first 2.5 square miles of the 33-square-mile Dongtan site to be developed  --  which will house the first 80,000 of its eventual 500,000 inhabitants  --  will sit at the edge of a bird refuge for the endangered black-faced spoonbill . This starter section of the city , made up of three separate villages , will be bisected by waterways and walking and biking paths , bounded by public-transport loops and green space . Water taxis will ply its canals , and the only vehicles allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero noise and zero emissions . No residence will be farther than three minutes by foot from a park , seven minutes from public transportation , and eight minutes from a village center . Street lamps will be solar-powered , wastewater will be treated and recycled , and buildings will use two thirds less energy than conventional structures . Dongtan will run on 100 percent renewable energy , much of which will come from a plant powered by rice husks , an unwanted by-product that could arrive by barge from up the Yangtze . With notable exceptions  --  including hyper-efficient , LED-lit " plant factories " where organic crops will be stacked on five layers of trays  --  Dongtan 's innovation is its holistic perspective , not its individual technological breakthroughs . Its ecological footprint , the amount of land it takes to sustain one of its citizens , is just 6.4 acres per person . ( In London and Shanghai , by comparison , it takes around 14.5 acres . In Houston it 's nearly 30 acres . ) By 2010 , when a 15-mile bridge-and-tunnel complex over and under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed and the World Expo is held in Shanghai ( which in these parts gets mentioned far more often than Beijing 's 2008 Olympics ) , Dongtan will be ready for its first residents . How ? " Building happens five times as fast here , " Head explained . " Everything goes at a factor of five in China . " The next morning , on a smoggy , dreary day , I joined 100 or so of the green architects and engineers  --  participants in the biennial Holcim Forum on Sustainable Construction  --  on a tour of Dongtan and Chongming , all of which , the government says , will be responsibly developed as an " eco-island . " We took buses to a Yangtze ferry to more buses , shuttling past a few incongruous , smoke-spitting factories to reach the Chongming exhibition center . Inside were local dignitaries and a scale model of the island and its master plan . For 10 minutes , a robotic voice droned on in perfect English about the green future of Chongming . Outside the Dongtan site , which takes up just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parks and lakes and a new " oriental Geneva " conference center . Everything seemed master-planned down to the placement of the sailboats , and as the Chinese officials dodged every specific question asked , I found myself increasingly skeptical that the island 's development would be anywhere near as green as promised . The crowd seemed to feel the same way . " Is it realistic ? " asked a German architect standing near me of his Brazilian friend . " It 's total crap  --  propaganda , " the other replied . The buses next took us to a patch of supposedly sustainable McMansions , and the multinational crowd of architects scoffed at the American-size , single-family homes . Clearly built for the elite , they had giant living rooms , garages , balconies , and sculpted yards with rock gardens and bamboo-shaded walkways . " This one will be perfect for 30 or 40 migrant workers , " whispered a Swiss planner . " There are no stores in the bottom floors , no places to eat , " griped a Spaniard . " They 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no organic farmers and then to the Dongtan wetland , where not a single bird was in sight . With the bridge soon to connect mostly undeveloped Chongming to downtown Shanghai ( travel time will be shortened to 40 minutes from the current three hours on boat and bus ) , construction was everywhere  --  villas , apartment blocks , bridges , roads  --  and very little of it seemed particularly green . The perspective was sobering . The first phase of Dongtan , which will be completed over the next decade , will take up one eighth of a 33-square-mile site that is itself only 1/14 of the 470-square-mile island , which is itself only one fifth the area of the Shanghai municipality , which is itself only a tiny piece of massive China : 18.7 million people and 2,448 square miles in a country of 1.3 billion people and 3.7 million square miles . As sustainable and hopeful and unassailably brilliant as Dongtan may aspire to be , a showcase eco-city can do little on its own to save China from itself . I MADE A SECOND Dongtan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend of a friend of a friend who wore high-heeled , knee-high leather boots as we tromped through the mud . Sissi is 21 and owns three cellphones ( she can never remember to recharge them in time , so she just swaps them out ) . She works as a party and music promoter when not studying , and she loves hip-hop and Beijing punk rock . Recently , she told me , some exchange students at her university taught her how to do the " booty shake . " She wore a jacket with a blue faux-fur collar , and her gray sweater read " Abercrombie " ( but not " Fitch " ) . Her mother had been " reeducated " here on Chongming Island along with other Shanghai intellectuals during the Cultural Revolution , forced to work the fields for four years . Her father 's office , the customs building on the historic Bund waterfront , was taken over by families who hung their laundry in its stately halls . But Sissi 's family had emerged in a good position in the new , money-driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to see the Chongming gold rush  --  properties already selling for an inflated $45 a square foot will climb to $70 or more when the bridge is complete  --  through the eyes of the elite , Westernizing Shanghainese . Sissi and I talked first with three women planting watermelon seeds in a muddy field . They were in their 50s and 60s and were bending over in the sun , using a foot-long stick to measure out the distance between seeds . Last year their own land , allotted to them by the government , was taken away to be developed , part of the green master plan for Chongming . They now receive 440 yuan ( about $57 ) a month in restitution  --  not enough , they said . To supplement it , they work here for a local boss on 40 acres of land that itself may soon be reclaimed by the government , making just over 50 cents an hour in 8- to 10-hour days . In the nearby town of Niupeng , Sissi and I saw where many of the displaced Chongming farmers are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 12- to 24-unit apartment blocks . One complex had at least 40 of these buildings , and alongside it was a neighborhood of razed homes , traditional dwellings similar to Old Huangbaiyu 's that were being cleared to make way for more high-density housing . Red banners with yellow characters  --  " Cooperate with the Government 's Work "  --  hung one after another over Niupeng 's main street , on either side of which were piles of rubble . One lot was a graveyard of wooden doors collected from the destroyed houses . About 20 of the neighborhood 's homes were holdouts , still standing as their owners waited for a better payout from the authorities . Before we returned to the skyscrapers of downtown Shanghai , we stopped where the new bridge and its six-lane highway will make landfall . Already all 216 of the structure 's deepwater piers were in place , stretching out of sight across the Yangtze , an endless line of enormous cement stumps . Workers in yellow helmets and orange life jackets , mostly migrants from the south , swarmed the site . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight-hour shifts per day ; construction went on nonstop , seven days a week . Those who worked and slept on the middle section of the bridge , out in the center of the brown river , took turns each night toting the crew 's cellphones to and from land , where they could get text messages from wives and families . The scale of the project  --  the size of the human tide that will swallow Chongming whole  --  was hard to miss , and Sissi did n't . " I have to bring my mother back here so we can invest in some properties , " she said . THE WORLD 'S MOST polluted city is a funny place to find hope for China 's ecological future , but that 's where I found it . Linfen , an ancient Chinese capital in the middle of what is now the country 's richest coal province , Shanxi , was number one on China 's list of most polluted cities in 2004 , 2005 and 2006 It topped the global roster put out in 2006 by the Blacksmith Institute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chernobyl , Ukraine , and Dzerzhinsk , Russia ( site of a Cold War-era chemical- weapons plant ) . Linfen became infamous overnight , a mandatory stop for newspaper correspondents . " It 's an apocalyptic vision of clanking factories , spewing smokestacks , burning flames , suffocating fumes , slag heaps , constant haze and relentless dust , " wrote Geoffrey York in Canada 's Globe and Mail in February . By reputation , Linfen is the only place in China where you can walk down the hall of your hotel and actually see the air . Flora and I arrived carrying special Japanese face masks and wardrobes in which the only pieces of white clothing were my tube socks . What we had n't prepared for was the possibility that Linfen would be sunny and pleasant , freshened by a spring breeze rushing through a basin that often traps in air pollution . Shanxi Province has 270 billion tons of proven coal reserves , and coal is everywhere  --  piled in back alleys , sold in burnable cubes from the back of mopeds , used to pop the popcorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steel smelters surround the city . Part of the improvement was the season ; the worst pollution is in winter , when homes burn coal for warmth and the air is dead calm . But every resident we talked to said it was n't just the weather , that Linfen was actually becoming cleaner . We visited the local SEPA office to find out why . The windowsills were covered with dust , the walls stained gray from soot , but in the building 's entryway was an LCD screen displaying the air-pollution index  --  today was a passable two on a scale of five . Yang Zhaofeng , the bureau 's deputy director , was summoned , and we sat with him and a crowd of underlings in a room ringed with leather chairs . Yang 's explanation of Linfen 's rebirth was simple : " After we found out we were number one in pollution , we did all we could to take off the dunce cap . " Linfen 's descent into coal-fired hell happened at a staggering pace . It began with the economic boom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic energy demand spiked , coal prices jumped , and the reins on private mine owners were loosened . At its low point , in 2004 , Linfen had only 15 days out of 365 with an acceptable level of air pollution ( two or above on the index ) . But now , Yang said , the cleanup was equally dramatic . The first step was to block coal trucks at the city 's boundaries ; suddenly there was much less coal dust . Next came heating : In 2006 alone , Linfen added enough gas-fired central heating to reach more than half of the city 's 4.1 million people , and it knocked down 197 large coal-fired boilers and more than 600 smaller , family-size boilers . Now 85 percent of the city uses natural gas rather than coal for their heating . Perhaps most significant is the crackdown on dirty factories at the fringes of Linfen . SEPA forced 100 of the smaller , less efficient , often illegal ones to close last year , and this year it has given notice to nearly 150 more . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government is helping them to install sulfur scrubbers . With those that do n't follow its directives , SEPA plays hardball  --  freezing their bank accounts , cutting off their electricity , and blocking all transportation to and from the facility . Flora and I heard rumors that , if needed , SEPA sometimes takes a final step : It sends in an explosives team and simply blows up the offending businesses . The result ? In 2006 , Linfen had 202 days above level two on the pollution index . By May of this year , it already had 87  --  22 days ahead of last year 's pace . Recently the city of Urumqi , in far western China , overtook Linfen to become first on the country 's list of most polluted cities . " When you come back next year , Linfen will be even cleaner , " Yang promised . On our final morning in Linfen , a government handler who had attached himself to us after the SEPA meeting  --  a man I knew by his English moniker , Sunshine  --  picked us up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top attraction , the Yao Temple . Linfen , known as Pingyang in ancient times , is considered one of China 's first capitals , and its first ruler more than 4,000 years ago was Emperor Yao . We were in a black sedan with leather seats , the symbol of power in new China . " I am from the municipal government , " the driver barked at the guards when we reached the temple , and we drove up and walked right through the door once reserved for the emperor . We saw some gongs and a well that apparently still had potable water , and then a monk fleeced me for $25 by blessing the largest stick of incense he could find , handing it to me , and asking me to pay for it as Sunshine nodded encouragingly . The day was sunny and the sky blue , and when the monk lit the eight-foot-long stick of incense for me , its smoke was the worst air pollution I 'd experienced in Linfen . Newly blessed , we walked next door to Yao Miao Square , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had built it . Completed in 2005 , just in time to host the 2005 Miss Universal Bikini contest , the square 's centerpiece was a 170-foot-tall gate ( we were repeatedly told it was slightly taller than the Arc de Triomphe ) that was filled with replicas representing the entirety of Chinese history : busts of Confucius , bronze miniatures of the Great Wall , statues of the heroes who invented gunpowder , paper and the compass . We rode an elevator to the roof and looked out over Linfen 's forest of smokestacks , very few of which were spewing any smoke . Flora and I descended , said goodbye to Sunshine , and hailed a taxi that would take us on an unsupervised tour of the industrial suburb of He Xi . There the buildings were stained brown-gray and the road was covered in layers of coal dust , but , as SEPA had claimed , the majority of the factories were shuttered . On the side of the road we met two workers who had just lost their jobs at a steel factory . They had earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller chunks , but a month ago the government shut the factory  --  and them  --  down . It was not an uplifting encounter , but in the context of China 's massive pollution problem , the brute efficiency with which the city 's economy had been turned upside down offered grounds for a sort of hope . Linfen , once the shortest plank in the Chinese barrel , was far better proof than Dongtan or Huangbaiyu that China 's top-down , authoritarian development model  --  an unyielding machine greatly more efficient than that of a messy democracy  --  could apply to ecological as well as economic progress . In the center of the former most polluted city in the world , it was evident that if China wills it , it has the power to impose environmentalism by fiat , to green the entire country at five times the speed the West ever could . All the rest of the world has to do is wait . McKenzie Funk 's last POPSCI feature was about road-tripping in the tiny Smart car .
