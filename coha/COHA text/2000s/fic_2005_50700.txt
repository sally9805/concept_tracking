BEFORE AARON KING 'S DEATH , my brother and I had never been to a funeral . It was a Tuesday or Wednesday morning in late March , a school day , and I felt lucky to be staying home when I was n't sick . Aaron was my brother 's best friend 's brother ; I had never met him . <p> I was the last one down to breakfast and was surprised to find that Andrew had missed a cellophane-wrapped tattoo of an airplane at the bottom of the cereal box . " Could you please open this for me ? " I said , holding out the tattoo to my father . <p> He lowered his newspaper . " This is n't supposed to be fun , Katie . " <p> Our mother walked over from the kitchen sink and said , " Give it to me . " She took the tattoo and pulled open the wrapper . Then to my father , " She 's only seven . " <p> On another day , this would have meant nothing to our father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were expected to wait extensive lengths of time between bathroom breaks on car trips and to budget our allowances for spending money . This was his idea of parenting : preparing us for the realities of life . Once , at the movie theater , I forgot my pink zipper purse and had to borrow three dollars from my father , with interest , to buy popcorn . Dad was often saying things like , " Money does n't grow on trees , " and " You 've got to be more mature , " especially to Andrew , who was two years older than me . Our mother hardly ever intervened . <p> After breakfast I asked to be excused , and Andrew and I played Monopoly Junior on the carpet in his room until Mom came in and told us to clean up . Andrew had monopolies on all but the light blue properties , and I was happy to quit before I was bankrupted . <p> " Time to get dressed , " she said . <p> " I am dressed . " I was wearing a navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This thing hurts my armpits , " I said . <p> My mother shrugged ; there was nothing she could do about it . " Andrew , " she said quietly , " time to get dressed . " <p> The first time Josh King came over to our house , I had a tantrum on the kitchen floor because without Andrew I had no one to play with . Mom helped me off the linoleum and took me to the backyard where the boys were already deep in a game , Andrew calling himself Isaiah Thomas , and then yelling , " Alleyoop . " <p> " Include your sister , " Mom said , offering me to Andrew like a present . Josh and Andrew stood ten feet apart on the concrete driveway , Josh slowly dribbling the ball at his side . She guided me by the shoulders , and I allowed myself to be stationed between the boys . " She can be your cheerleader , " Mom said , then went inside to watch Perry Mason . <p> For a while I watched them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very good , but twice Josh got it in and I did a lame cheer , shouting " Go , Josh , go , " until Andrew told me to shut up . <p> At nine years old Josh was already tall , with sandy brown hair that curled in tight ringlets against his scalp . Andrew and I had the same thin , blond hair , and I was mesmerized by Josh 's curls . They stood off his scalp , and I wanted to put my fingers in his hair to see what was inside . <p> When the basketball landed on the garage and rolled to a stop in the storm gutter , the boys threw sticks , trying to dislodge it . <p> " Forget it , " Andrew said after a few minutes . " Let 's go down to the creek . " I jumped up but they had a head start running across the lawn , their dirty sneakers kicking up mud . Barefooted , I followed , calling to them to wait . Halfway down the steps , I saw Andrew and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its deepest place . They scooted across , legs splayed on either side , hands inching them forward . <p> " Andrew ! " I called . " I 'm telling Mom . " <p> He turned to look at me . " Just hold on , " he said . " We wo n't be long . " <p> There were other things I might have done . I had dolls and stuffed animals and a set of fake kitchen food , plastic fried eggs and two cups stained half-empty with Coke-colored paint . I could have told on Andrew , but my mother would n't have done anything . She could n't abide fighting . She wanted everything between Andrew and me to be nice , easy . I sat down on the bottom step and waited for the boys to come back . <p> We climbed into the station wagon , and for once Andrew and I did n't fight about who got to sit on the side with the red cup holder . We liked to pluck it , bouncing it against the window until one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I watched the streets of our neighborhood slip by , and then unfamiliar streets near downtown Detroit . Small houses with no front lawns . High-rise apartment buildings . City Hall . The Kings were members of Stephen S. Wise Temple on Maplethorpe Avenue . Just before the underpass , Dad made a wrong turn and we sailed past Maplethorpe and the synagogue . <p> " It was right there , " Mom said , exasperated . <p> Dad touched her leg . " I 'll turn around . " <p> Five minutes later we walked into an enormous room with high ceilings and long glass windows . As soon as I saw Josh sitting between his parents in the front row , I wished that I were in school . Next to him , Josh 's mother with a broken leg and his father with stitches across his forehead ; both looked straight ahead . Somewhere an organ played . Josh was swiveled in his seat , chin on the back of his pew . When he saw Andrew , he smiled and waved with his left hand . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he had a yarmulke on his head . <p> For Halloween , Josh and Andrew had begged Mom to let them trick-or-treat unchaperoned . They wanted to go as the right and left high-top of a pair of Air Jordans , and Andrew said it would look stupid if Mom came with them . <p> " What 'll look stupid is a pair of shoes , " I said . I was planning to go as Cindy Lauper . Mom was making my wig . <p> " Katie , " my mom warned , grabbing Andrew 's arm just before he could punch me . Then to Andrew : " You 'll have to ask your father when he gets home . " <p> Dad said it was OK as long as the boys were home before dark . " Take your sister , " he added , and when Andrew complained , he said , " She 's your sister , " as though this were n't the very reason Andrew objected . <p> Andrew looked at me , and I wanted to say that I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself to do it . <p> Our mother made us watch a safety video a few days before the thirty-first . Never talk to strangers . If you sense danger , run to the nearest house and ring the bell . Beware of peeping Toms . " We do that , " Andrew said , meaning Josh and him . " We spy on people . " My mother said , " Peeping Toms are different , " but that night , I had trouble sleeping . Andrew 's room was connected to mine by a shared bathroom , and I imagined him peering under the crack in the door . <p> " Andrew ? " I whispered . " Are you there ? " <p> I thought I could hear him tiptoeing back to his room . <p> I skulked into my parents ' room and sat cross-legged in the big pink armchair on my father 's side of the bed , where he was snoring softly into his pillow . It only took minutes before my mother sat up . <p> " What are you doing ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick-or-treating alone . " <p> My father rolled over and said , " What 's wrong ? Why is she up ? " <p> " Go back to sleep , Steve . " She took my hand and walked me to my room . <p> The Kings had a small reception at their house following the funeral . We were going to be sitting Shiva , which my mother said meant sitting on low stools . She said all the mirrors in the Kings ' house would be covered . She said that it was perfectly acceptable not to speak . <p> Driving across town again , my father said , " This is probably the last thing they want to be doing right now . I ca n't imagine . " <p> Mom shrugged . " It 's nice to have something to focus on , I guess . " <p> " Why do we have to go ? " I said . " I 've had enough . " <p> " Do n't talk like that , " my mother said . My father reached back and swatted my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of brothers and sisters , a house full of kids . We would have to share bedrooms and chairs at the dinner table , and if one of us had a friend over or went to college or got hit by a car , it would n't matter as much because there would always be more . <p> Andrew did n't talk the entire way to the Kings ' house . He looked out the window and I looked at the back of his head , his blond hair combed into place . <p> " Andrew ? " I whispered , but he continued to stare out the window . At the time , I thought he was ignoring me , which had become standard procedure since he met Josh . Now I realize he was probably crying and did n't want me to see . <p> The car accident had happened on a Saturday night when Andrew and I were already asleep . The next morning , as we were getting ready for church , Mom asked us to come into their bedroom . <p> I walked in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other trailing behind me like a deflated balloon . I had said it was too hot for tights , but Mom told me she 'd be the one to decide that . <p> Andrew followed with his tie hanging around his neck . " What ? " he said . <p> " Sit down , " Dad said . We were supposed to leave for church in twenty minutes , but he had n't shaved and my mother was half dressed . <p> " Josh 's family had a car accident last night , " Morn said . " Josh and his parents are OK , but Aaron is in the hospital . We 're all praying for him . " <p> " Who told you this ? " Andrew said , arms stiff at his sides . " Did Frank call ? " <p> Frank was Josh and Aaron 's father . I was jealous that Andrew had a friend whose parents let Andrew call them by their first names . <p> " Elise just called , " Mom said . <p> I looked over at Andrew and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die ? " I said . <p> What might she have been thinking ? After all the warnings-wear your seatbelts ; look both ways before crossing the street ; put the toilet seat down after flushing ; never go where I ca n't see you ; do n't watch too much TV ; be nice to each other : you 're all you 've got-a child was dead . She used to warn us against playing in abandoned refrigerators , and now , weeks away from giving birth to my first child , I picture myself as I was then-lanky , with too-skinny legs and blond bangs cut ruler-straight across my forehead-trapped inside a dark fridge , squatting on the bottom shelf . Never in my life have I seen an abandoned refrigerator . Our mother was soft-spoken and small with fair skin . She had a condition called essential tremor , which meant that her hands shook slightly all the time . She watched old movies on TV , anything in black and white , and when she picked stories to read to me before bed , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Is he ? " Andrew said . <p> She put out her hands , somewhere between a shrug and reaching for a hug , and I watched them for so long that her fingers blurred . <p> " He might , " Dad said finally . <p> Andrew dropped his necktie on the carpet and said , " I 'm not going to church . " <p> Years later , when we were coming home from our mother 's funeral , Andrew told me this story : while Josh was busy with relatives at the Kings ' reception , Andrew wandered into the kitchen for a Coke then walked down the hall to Aaron 's room , where the Atari games were stored ; he sorted through a pile until he found the cartridge he wanted . <p> Andrew was sitting on the gray carpet at the foot of Aaron 's bed , playing Pole Position , when Frank King walked in . Andrew had n't thought to turn down the volume , and I picture Mr. King standing in the hallway , on his way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of cars racing , revving , shifting . How surprised he must have been to realize it had all been a mistakethe hospital , the funeral , the reception . The whole time , Aaron had been right there . <p> As soon as Mr. King opened the door , Andrew knew that coming into Aaron 's room had been a mistake . He crouched at the foot of the bed , holding the joystick in both hands . <p> " Aaron ? " <p> Andrew looked up . " I 'm sorry , " he said . <p> Mr. King put his hands to his face , covering his eyes . He started to leave the room then turned and rushed to the foot of the bed . Before he could pull my brother into a hug , Andrew slipped out to the hallway and hurried to find our father . <p> At the end of that school year , our father 's company transferred him to Dallas and we left Detroit . Soon after , my mother heard that Frank and Elise King were separated . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living at home with his mother . Andrew and Josh still talked on the phone , and Josh told my brother that his father often called late at night and left messages on the answering machine telling his mom how sorry he was . <p> " Sorry for what ? " I asked my brother . Andrew shrugged . He had asked Josh the same thing and Josh said , " I guess because he was driving the car . " <p> But it 's never as simple as that . In the months after Aaron 's death , Frank King had slept with a woman from work , first on a business trip in Tulsa and then weeknights when he was supposed to be working late . I do n't know how my mother knew this . After Frank moved out , Elise started going to synagogue more and more and Josh was often home alone . My mother invited Josh to come live with us in Dallas for the summer , play basketball and swim in our pool , but Elise said she could n't stand to have him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Because of Frank King 's affair , on a night in October when our own father did not come home from work , I immediately thought of Josh 's dad . I told my mother that no matter what happened , I would want to stay with her . It was the beginning of a new school year . I missed my friends in Detroit . I was ready to go back . <p> " You do n't know what you 're talking about , " Mom said . <p> I thought I did . " It 's like the Kings , " I said . <p> " They lost a child ! " my mother shouted . Then mostly to herself , " You ca n't understand that . " <p> The next morning Dad was home . His beard was stubbly and his eyes were red behind his glasses . Andrew and I crouched outside their bedroom door and listened with our ears pressed against the wood . <p> " What did you want me to do about it , Kay ? There was nothing I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Will you stop ? " Mom said . " The kids are right outside . " <p> Andrew and I exchanged looks then walked downstairs . <p> " It 's nothing , " he said , pouring a bowl of cereal . <p> " You 're lying . " <p> " What do you think it is ? " <p> I could tell he was testing me and I said , " Dad 's having an affair , like Mr. King . " <p> Andrew shook his head . " That 's not it . " <p> " What , then ? " <p> " Did n't you see the TV ? " he said . " Dad lost a lot of money . " <p> It was October 1987 . In our school lunches we found Adirondack Cola instead of Coke , Bravo corn chips instead of Fritos . Mom told us not to bother our father , and the house was unusually quiet . <p> In our new house , Andrew 's room was not connected to mine by a bathroom . He slept at the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at night when I could n't sleep , I listened to footsteps on the floor-quick for Andrew using the bathroom , long and light for Mom going up and down the stairs . One night just before Thanksgiving , after Mom and Andrew had gone to sleep , I heard the sound of the TV downstairs . I lay on my back , looking at the shadows on the ceiling cast by the streetlamp outside my window . An upside-down kite , its tail wagging toward the top of the doorframe as it sailed to the carpet . A pair of long , skinny legs , no body , no head . The volume on the TV was too loud , and I wondered if my father had fallen asleep . <p> I crept to the landing and peered down at him in his recliner , drink in hand . He wore bifocals , and the blue of the TV reflected on his glasses . I watched him for a long time with no idea that he was looking straight at me . <p> " Katie , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I could n't sleep , " I said . I hoped he would tell me to go to bed , but instead he motioned me down . <p> " Me either , " he said . " You hungry ? Thirsty ? " He raised his glass . <p> I shook my head . <p> We 'd been watching TV awhile when I said , " Leslie Martin told me the stock market crashed and people lost their jobs and all their money . " I did n't mention that Andrew had said the same thing . <p> " Leslie Martin , huh ? " <p> " Did we ? " <p> " Did Leslie Martin ? " <p> " No . Her dad 's a doctor . " <p> " Great , " he said . " Well , Dr. Martin will have his one day . Every family gets it one way or another . " He turned to me . " Do n't worry , " he said . " Chin up . We 're fine . " <p> When summer came , Andrew and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father that she did n't care what it cost : the kids had to have something to do . <p> She enrolled us in tennis lessons at Highland Park High School , and Andrew was good but I was terrible . Our instructor 's name was Oliver . He had red hair and freckles and initially I had a crush on him , but he often said things like , " Katie Tilden , you 're not running , " and " Katie Tilden , give me three laps for dodging that volley , " so by the end of the summer , I had grown to hate him . <p> The last tennis lesson of the summer , we played Around the World and I was the first one out . We all watched as Andrew and a boy two years older rallied for fifteen minutes , dropping their racquets after each stroke and spinning in place to simulate the obstacle of running to the other side of the court . Finally , Andrew hit a deep shot to the boy 's backhand , and the boy got his racquet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " That 's it , " Oliver said , clapping . " Tilden 's our 9:45 Champion . " Then he turned to me and said , " First one out : balls in the hopper . " <p> I felt everyone looking at me . I found my brother 's face in the crowd . Sweating , breathing hard , Andrew seemed to glow . <p> I turned to Oliver and said , " No . " <p> " No , what ? " <p> " No , I wo n't pick up the balls . " <p> I knew as soon as I said it that I would be punished . All it would take was Oliver reporting to our mother . At home she 'd send me to my room , and minutes later my father would appear , knocking first , as if I could say , " Do n't come in . " <p> Instead , what happened is Andrew said , " I think it 's my turn . " He began to load the bright tennis balls onto the head of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the corner of my eye , expecting them to fall , but they never did . <p> February 1990 . The wooden guardrail in the parking lot of my father 's new office building . I was practicing my balance beam routine while waiting for my father to finish giving Mom a tour . One misstep after a half pirouette , forty stitches near my knee . <p> May 1991 . The pitcher 's mound of the Little League field behind what used to be Lancaster Hardware . Andrew threw a pitch and Timothy Blackman sent a line drive back into my brother 's eye . Three stitches across the eyebrow and the lid swelled shut . <p> December 1991 . During a visit to our grandmother 's in Toronto , Dad drove Bebe 's car into a ditch . It was snowing and he could n't see a thing . $1700 damage to the car but no one was hurt . <p> In April of my first year in middle school , my mother went for a routine mammogram and they found a lump on her right breast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it had spread to her lymph nodes . I can say this : as soon as Mom and Dad sat us down in the living room to tell us what the doctors had found , I knew it for what it was . <p> Within three months she was wearing a wig much like the one she made for my Cindy Lauper costume . My mother bore it all well . Dad took a leave from work , and she let herself be cared for . He tended to her as though she were a child , speaking in hushed tones and blowing on her food before feeding it to her . At night I watched TV in her bed , and sometimes Dad let me stay so that I fell asleep sandwiched between my parents . <p> On her birthday she sat at the head of the table in front of a chocolate cake that she could n't eat and blew out four candles , one for each decade of her life . We sang to her , and when we finished , the three of us were smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were closed , and we had thought she was making a wish . <p> " Mom , " Andrew said , and we all looked at him . Even our mother looked to see what he could possibly say . <p> " There 's no reference , not even one word about death in the Kaddish . " <p> My father and I stared at him as though he were crazy . We were n't Jewish , we had n't been to church in years . <p> " Andrew , " Dad said , but Mom just nodded , her lips pursed , considering it . <p> That night I went to his room . I was twelve and he was fifteen , and we slept head-to-toe in his single bed , his body warm next to mine . I turned on my side , fitting to his body like a puzzle piece . Under the sheets I found the material of his pajama bottoms and held on . <p> " Where 'd you get that Kaddish thing ? " I said . <p> " I talked to Josh the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is he really religious ? " <p> " No . They just observe the anniversary of Aaron 's death . " <p> " Weird . " <p> " What ? That they observe the anniversary ? " <p> " I do n't know . No . That you talked about Mom . " <p> " He 's been through it , you know . " <p> " It 's not the same . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> Because I did n't want it to be . I did n't want it to be . I did n't want it . <p> The evening before our mother 's funeral , Josh , who was now taller than Andrew but with the same curly hair he had as a boy , flew in late and left right after the service , but he was there . He still lived in Detroit and went to the high school his brother would 've been in . His parents remarried when he was twelve , and although neither was very old , they had no more children . <p> Just after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our driveway to play one-on-one . None of us had slept the night before . While I watched the boys ' game , my father drank coffee in the kitchen . <p> " Just like old times , " I said , wishing it were true . <p> " Yeah , " Josh said , " Your brother still sucks . " And it really was as though nothing had changed . They barely saw me as they threw up bricks and went for rebounds , elbowing each other to get to the ball . Once , Andrew grabbed Josh 's shirt while Josh was shooting , and they played on as though these were the rules our father came outside with his coffee mug in hand . " Two-on-two ? " Andrew said . <p> Dad looked at him . What else was there to do ? He set his mug in the grass and showed his hands for the ball . <p> It was Andrew and me against Josh and my father in a game of twenty-one . No one talked . I was thinking of Mom : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink . I waited to hear her voice . Dad and Andrew could have been thinking anything . I watched their faces for signs . Dad threw up a shot and boxed out , putting a body on Andrew . Andrew rolled off him , got the rebound , and cleared the ball at the top of the key . He cross-dribbled from hand to hand , eyeing the basket , then suddenly drove the lane , taking off from the foul line . He had an open shot and we all looked to the rim , but at the last second he underhanded the ball , passing off , knocking the wind out of me as I caught it in my stomach . <p> Andrew said , " Pass it . Dribble . " I tried to breathe . Andrew said , " What are you doing ? " My mouth gaped , but nothing went in or out . Frozen , the day did not include my mother 's funeral . It was a pick-up game in the driveway . It was a clear day , an airplane painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four of us , three boys circling me , Andrew showing his hands for a pass , Dad trying to bat the ball away , Josh v-cutting across the key . I think the score was eight to nine . <p> Fifteen years later , which is to say now , I am eight months pregnant and hoping it 's a girl . It 's a long weekend , Columbus Day , and Josh is visiting Andrew in Austin , where he is a 3L , living with his old fraternity brothers , and in no rush to do anything in particular , he says . Josh and Andrew called me at two in the morning to say hi . They woke my husband , who is good-natured and rolled over and went back to sleep . <p> " Have you had it yet ? " Andrew said , giggling . <p> " Do you know what time it is ? " <p> " Saturday night , " he said . <p> They passed the receiver back and forth , asking me things like , " Are you going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What if it turns out to be quadruplets ? " They were laughing and I barely made out their words . <p> Dad is staying in the guest room to be present when his first grandchild is born . He came down the hall and knocked at our bedroom door to ask if everything was OK . <p> " Hold on , " I said to Andrew . " Dad , it 's just Andrew fooling around . " <p> " At this hour ? " he said . " What time is it ? " <p> " Late . I 'm hanging up . Good night , " I called to Dad , and then , into the phone , " Good night , guys . " <p> Now everybody else is asleep , and I am thinking of you . I have so little to go on ; I barely remember the sound of your voice . . . . When my breath came back , I dribbled to the top of the key to start the game again . The sun was high over the horizon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must remember this : We played as long as we could , until it was time to leave for the church . <p> Author Affiliation
