Chapter One My dearest love , Please do not abandon me . The only solace that I can find is the hope that you will mourn for the return that I can not promise . Thinking of you , I am unable to sleep . The prayer call of the priests ' silver trumpets has yet to mark the dawn , and I write by the light of an oil lamp , knowing this activity will not disturb my hosts . First , I wish you to know that I arrived safely for Passover , and I can report that Pascal and Seraphine are in good health . Now that my travel has ended , I have the luxury of applying markings to scroll . Far apart as we are , my intent is to begin each day of this week with you . I picture you listening to my letter and thus pretend we are in conversation . It aids me that I can imagine you reclining on your couch in our villa far above the harbor . I see your pretty head tilted sideways as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casts a shadow across your face , and the ocean breeze plucks at your soft dark hair much more gently than my rough fingers were ever able . It is how I like to dream of you . Does it surprise you that I now take such trouble with words ? Me ? Your stony-faced husband who deals so harshly with sailors and merchants ? I have not hired a poet as you might suspect . No , the distance between us makes my heart ache with sentiment , and it is easier to be weak for you when you can not see how I tremble . Last night , as I fell into troubled sleep , I could not escape thoughts of you : your soft singing as you brush your hair , your flashes of temper and immediate remorse . I remembered , too , our wedding-how you quivered with fear and anticipation and held me so tightly in our first moments alone that I thought my ribs would crack . All I have are the thousands of memories with you since then . Simple memories . Watching you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market with your arms laden . The perfume in your hair as we fell asleep together . The sight of you with a suckling child . All of it . What we have lost in the present , I relive in the past . Even on the road from Caesarea to Jerusalem , among the pilgrims on foot and riding wagons and mules , I found myself turning to you again and again in the crowd to share comments on the sights and sounds . You were not , of course , beside me , and on each occasion my heart grew heavier . It is far worse , is it not , when you can only blame yourself for what is lost ? when what you have lost becomes far sweeter because you will never have it again ? Let us not fool ourselves . You no longer love me . That you are faithful , I have no doubt . But you do not love me . I warn you now that in these letters I intend to pursue your hand with the same passion I did during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me all over again . Yet when I find the courage to tell you what I must , I wonder how you could ever offer that gift again . At the least , you will finally understand what has driven us apart . And why we will never be together again . Until I find the courage , permit me these daily contemplations . Above all , think of my love for you . Your Simeon Chapter Two Incense and silk . Scent and satin . Irresistible , at least to those who could afford it . Absently-a touch once trained is a touch that would not forget-I ran my hand over a roll of dark silk in the front corner of the market shop . My fingers traced a few flaws , but I said nothing . Three women stood in front of me , their veiled heads bobbing as they simultaneously haggled prices with my cousin Pascal . I watched with as much amusement as I allowed myself in those days . The women had my sympathy . Their nostrils were filled with perfume , their grasping fists filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coins . Against Pascal 's shrewdness , they stood little chance . I waited patiently , knowing Pascal would allow them the small victory of an extended battle . Although it was well past dawn , little sunlight reached Pascal 's wares . The shading was deliberate . He did not want his colors to fade . As well , dimness added confusion to a shop cluttered with rolls of silk and purple cloth , giving the impression that Pascal 's luxuries spilled endlessly and sloppily , waiting for a buyer to take advantage of his carelessness . While the first was true-Pascal did have wealth a king might envy-not a single thread of silk floated out the door without Pascal 's knowledge and consent . When the women happily admitted defeat and walked past me with their armloads of wares , I turned so they could not see the angry burn scar that showed through my beard on the left side of my face . Their veils hid their eyes , but not their sight . " Simeon , " my cousin Pascal said . " Did you sleep well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fifteen years older than I. The night before , when I had arrived at his mansion in the upper city , I had seen him for the first time with his new wife . They made an interesting contrast . She-young and plump with golden-red hair , a ready smile , and plain clothing . He-old and thin and bald above a scraggly white beard , dressed in layers of luxury and chains of gold . Yet I had no reason to second-guess Pascal 's choice of wives ; he had already outlived three and could be expected by now to know what he did and did not like in a woman . " I slept well , " I said . " That is a poor lie . " He gave me his toothy lion 's grin . " You do not look rested . " I shrugged . Pascal pointed to where I had been standing . " That roll of silk you examined ... " " Adequate quality , " I answered , " but merely adequate , despite its rich appearance . I think water has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do not choose to set up a shop opposite me here in Jerusalem . " Another toothy grin . " You are right , of course . Fools and camels and a sudden rainstorm . I paid a fraction of what it is worth . As you might guess , however , I will not take that into consideration when the wives of rich men- " " Pascal , purchase everything I have , " I said bluntly . My words stopped him flat , probably the first time I had seen him unable to immediately grasp a situation . " My ships , my warehouses , my shops , " I said . " Everything . " He recovered , his grin replaced by serious study . He knew me well enough to understand I did not speak frivolously . He also knew me well enough not to ask for the reason behind my sudden offer . " For a fair price , of course , " he said , not so subtly testing me . " Perhaps less , " I answered . " I am far less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He studied me , looking past my appearance . " If it is not price , what , then , is your concern ? " he finally asked . " Honor , " I said . " That is why I decided to use Passover as an excuse to come to Jerusalem and approach you . " Two women entered the shop . Pascal did not have the opportunity to ask more . As for me , I was satisfied . I had planted the seed that would rapidly grow . By week 's end , I guessed , Pascal and I would come to terms . I left him with his customers and wandered out to see the city . * * * This was not my first visit to the Holy City . I knew what I would find as the markets came to life over the next few hours . The streets would be crowded with bazaars peopled with shoemakers , tailors , flax spinners , goldsmiths , wool combers , butchers , food inspectors , and diplomats . The air would be filled with the smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the stench of leather being cured , tanned , and dyed . I would find food- and wineshops , where , if my appetite conquered my dull spirit , I could partake from a selection that varied from fried locusts to fresh fish to fruitcakes . Or I could be tempted by Judean or Galilean wines , or a wide range of foreign beers to break my recent vow to avoid drink . If I were after excitement , I could have dodged thieves and prostitutes in the lower city , among the dark underground alleys where a man could lose his soul and life to any number of different seductions . Or I could have cheered at the horse races in the Hippodrome , or disappeared into a theater in pursuit of distraction , or lost myself in the hot fog of steam rooms that were as luxurious as any in Rome . I knew , however , that no amount of activity would console me . I chose instead to seek the countryside beyond the city , using as my guide the distant smoke of the temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtain between earth and heaven . Chapter Three I spent the remainder of the morning in the dusty groves above the Kidron Valley , on the western slope of the Mount of Olives . From there I could quietly survey all of Jerusalem . A few hours later , I returned to the main road and joined the pilgrims moving into the Holy City . I could not know then , of course , how I was about to become part of an inexorable avalanche of events about to destroy the single innocent man who stood resolutely in its path . Not until later would I understand more , learning portions of it from those prominent in religious and political circles who welcomed me because of my wealth . Many of the other participants-servants and scribes , women and soldiers-later recounted their witness to His followers . Eventually , when combined with what the followers themselves had seen , this entire story would become clear to me ; I lean heavily on their accounts-admitting some speculation at their motives-for what I was unable to see myself . And what I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill . * * * To be more accurate , the events began in Bethphage , which lay on the eastern side of the Mount of Olives . Some considered Bethphage distinct from Jerusalem , for the deep Kidron Valley separated it from the city proper . Others-despite the valley between-considered Bethphage an extension of the city , and during Passover and the days before , the scattered collection of buildings that made up the hamlet were filled with festive pilgrims who could not find room to stay in Jerusalem . Bethphage is connected to Jerusalem by a caravan road that crosses the bottom of the Kidron Valley and passes by olive groves as it climbs the Mount of Olives . After the road reaches the top , it dips through Bethphage , then continues on a gentle descent into Bethany , a half mile away . From there , the caravan road reaches to Jericho and beyond . Little traffic , however , followed the road away from Jerusalem at this time of year . Instead , patriarch pilgrims jammed the road destined for the Holy City . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chickens , children , and other stubborn beasts irritated by long days of travel provided amusement for the residents of Bethphage who sat beside their homes and watched the parade . The crowds were at their most entertaining , for so near to Passover , people were impatient to reach the Holy City for purification in the temple . Furthermore , the warming weather had called out the idle travelers fortunate enough to have already secured lodging . The sky was weak blue in the high altitude , painted with wisps of clouds . A slight breeze kept the day from becoming hot , yet the sun had enough strength to banish all thoughts of winter . Among the traffic , two men approaching Bethphage gave little cause for notice until they began to untie a young donkey haltered to a post near its mother in front of an inn . Peter-redheaded and red-bearded-wore the rough clothing of a fisherman , with a sword strapped to his side and the perpetual scowl of suspicion common to laborers who understand no way to make money except with their hands . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a staff . Fumbling with the rope at the donkey 's side , Peter and John tried to ignore the hostile stares from a group of men nearby . The older men sat on chairs , surveying the road in dignified disdain ; the younger men stood behind them with their arms crossed , trying to appear equally important to passersby . " You ! " the tallest of the younger observers challenged , stepping toward Peter and John . " Red and stubby ! Mind giving an explanation ? " Mutters of support came from the others . Peter said nothing . " You ! " the man repeated . " Are you deaf ? Touched in the head ? " Peter straightened , his hands still on the halter rope . " I can hear you with no difficulty . As for my head , there is nothing wrong- " " Ho-ho , " the man laughed . He was bulky with the natural advantages of an athletic body , but his substantial belly showed he took his prowess for granted . " But a few words and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they grow are simpletons up there . " He paused , looking to his companions for support . Their grins were all the encouragement he needed . " So tell me , country boy , " the man continued . " What are you doing ? " The tendons at the side of Peter 's neck strained as he tried to control his temper . " This is a rope , " Peter said slowly . " The rope is attached to the donkey . My fingers are upon the rope . As my fingers pull apart the knot , the rope becomes untied . Once I untie the rope , the animal will be free . It is a simple concept . Surely even the dimmest of minds can- " " Peace , Peter , " John interrupted him . " Remember our instructions . " John turned and spoke directly to the gathered men , recalling how he had been instructed . " Our Lord needs this donkey . He will send it back shortly . " Peter 's chest rose and fell visibly as he took in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " one of the older men said , speaking to John before a fight could erupt , " this Lord of yours . Would He happen to be the prophet from Nazareth ? " " None other , " John replied . The group 's silence became a silence of respect . " We have heard rumors of His arrival . Will He pass by soon ? " John nodded . The old man thought for several seconds . " The story about a dead man , Lazarus of Bethany . Were you there ? " John nodded again . " Was it as described ? " the man asked . " A man raised from his tomb ? " " Words do not do it justice , " Peter said stoutly . " I smelled the stench of death from the tomb . And from the darkness he came , called out by our Lord . " The observers whispered among themselves . " Silence , " the old man barked . To John and Peter he spoke more quietly . He knew there could be no harm and possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of miracles . " Take the animal . " Both disciples led the donkey toward Bethany , where the teacher had already begun leading a procession on foot . As soon as Peter and John turned a corner in the road , the young men at the inn scattered to spread the news in all directions . Continues ...
