<p> Who 'd have thought a gussied-up home-decorating show could vault unknown TLC  --  home to rarely viewed series about surgery and pregnancy  --  into a Top 10 cable network ? <p> TLC , also known as The Learning Channel , was once one of many bewildering alphabet-soup networks  --  WE , TNN , HGTV  --  that viewers often breezed past while channel-surfing . " There was also a misperception that we were an educational channel for kids , " general manager Roger Marmet says . <p> Then two years ago came Trading Spaces , in which neighbors race to redo each other 's rooms on a budget , then squeal with delight  --  or recoil in horror  --  as they return to their spruced-up homes . Spurred by viewers ' thirst for voyeuristic reality series , the show " sort of turned design or how-to programming on its head , " Marmet says . And along the way , it developed a new audience for TLC . <p> Increasingly , the process is being repeated elsewhere on cable . The search for " signature " series  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's identity in the minds of viewers and Hollywood  --  is more crucial than ever . <p> In 1994 , the average home regularly settled on watching 10 of 40 channels received , according to Nielsen Media Research ; last year , viewers surfed past all but 15 of the 102 channels typically available . With the rollout of digital cable systems , viewers now get even more channels , and it 's getting much more difficult for any one to stand out . <p> " The fact is , you 're really not on the map as a cable network unless you have a signature show , " Kagan World Media analyst Larry Gerbrandt says . <p> Take FX . Until recently , research revealed viewers thought of FX as a sci-fi channel because of its name , if they had any idea at all of what it was . And it did show reruns of The X-Files , along with old M*A*S*H episodes and the raunchy Howard Stern comedy Son of the Beach . <p> Then last March it flashed The Shield , a gritty , sometimes brutal drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records and won star Michael Chiklis a Golden Globe and an Emmy . Almost magically , within a mere 13 episodes , the network had an identity as home to edgy , risk-taking programming . <p> Cable-size hits such as Shield or Spaces do more than establish a network 's image . Their success also can boost ratings for surrounding series , draw advertisers who must also buy weaker shows to sponsor the hits , and lure more cable operators to carry the channel and pay higher fees to do so . <p> During The Shield 's first season last spring , FX 's prime-time ratings jumped 57% ( helped by other schedule changes ) . Even after new episodes ended last summer , ratings were still up 33% from 2001 . <p> Ratings head ' South ' <p> In 1997 , raunchy cartoon South Park drew controversy and a sudden spotlight to Comedy Central  --  and helped the channel to eventually expand its potential audience by 40 million homes . Others boast of similar breakouts : Court TV has its Forensics Files , Food Network has Emeril , Sci Fi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park " changed everything , " says Doug Herzog , then Comedy 's president , who says the channel had been best known perhaps for reruns of a series starring portly British comedian Benny Hill . As the show took off , the channel 's paltry nightlong audience doubled to a half-million viewers . " Viewership rose , Madison Avenue started paying attention , the creative community suddenly wanted to start working with us , and most important , South Park made us a must-have , must-see network , " Herzog says . <p> On the other end of the spectrum , networks such as ABC Family and TNN desperately need a defining hit , while A &E; ( with Biography ) and VH1 ( Behind the Music ) squandered big ones , collapsing when viewers tired of them . <p> VH1 's problem " was that in four subsequent seasons , we did n't have any real breakout hits to follow it up , " says Tom Freston , chief of MTV Networks ( including VH1 ) . " In the meantime , we started burning it out ; all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which at one point accounted for a third of the entire lineup . <p> While a hit show such as The Shield " lifts the whole network , " Reilly says , it can only help so much . Though it undeniably adds luster , the overall ratings impact on a 24-hour schedule is small . Most cable channels still rely heavily on old movies and network reruns . So when an original series clicks with viewers , there 's a temptation to air it constantly  --  or simply clone it . <p> " With most shows , it 's about a spike , " Disney ABC Cable 's programmer Rich Ross says . Viewers " run into the room , they turn on the set , and they turn it off afterward . " Last fall , for example , Trading Spaces boosted TLC ratings by 16% , but subtracting the series , the network 's audience fell 3% . <p> Disney on the move <p> So the trick is finding compatible shows to build around it while the fire is still hot . " It 's a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're creating companions for your hit show without making Xeroxes , " Ross says . <p> That 's why Disney , which made big strides among preteen girls with comedy Lizzie McGuire , launched spy cartoon Kim Possible and , last month , family sitcom That 's So Raven in its wake . FX next month follows the second season of The Shield with Lucky , a comedic drama starring John Corbett ( My Big Fat Greek Wedding ) as a compulsive gambler . And TLC last week added two new shows with plans for more unscripted fare about makeovers , weddings and other " transformative " events . <p> And subscription service HBO has strung together a profitable procession of Sunday signature series  --  The Sopranos , Sex and the City and Six Feet Under  --  to complement its other fare . <p> MTV , in a quest to balance out its diet of music videos , has had a long string of signature series , from Spring Break to The Osbournes  --  which , following a pattern , became phenomenons and then cooled considerably . <p> " MTV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fast , so if you make yourself about a show , you unmake yourself in 12 months , " programming chief Brian Graden says . " I would always like our brand to be larger than any one thing . " <p> Some popular basic-cable networks , which tend to be far less specialized , have done well without signature series by defining themselves in other ways . Lifetime was among the first with original hourlong dramas ( The Division ) , but it 's best known for women-in-peril TV movies . USA  --  despite kudos and reasonable ratings for the series Monk and The Dead Zone  --  is far more reliant on daily doses of JAG . TNT prefers ratings from NBA basketball , Law &; Order reruns and movies over smaller returns from former series Bull and Witchblade . <p> The danger is in linking a network too closely to a single show , or failing to follow it up with another hit . " Series enhance the brand , " TNT general manager Steve Koonin says . " But if the series becomes your brand , inevitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The Shield ' : Cops on the edge <p> Cable channel : FX <p> What it is : Gritty drama about renegade cop ( Emmy winner Michael Chiklis ) willing to do bad things to do good . <p> Current time slot : Tuesdays at 10 p.m . ET/PT ; second-season finale airs April 1 <p> Current audience : 3.2 million viewers <p> What it did : Established the network as a home for serious fare , a departure from Howard Stern 's raucously raunchy Son of the Beach . With more movies added to M*A*S*H reruns , the channel 's ratings jumped 57% in prime time during the show 's first season and helped FX position itself as an edgy programmer between Fox and HBO . <p> What now : While The Shield awaits a third season next year , FX will try to repeat its luck with Lucky , a half-hour drama starring John Corbett as a compulsive gambler , coming April 8 , and a late-night sketch series starring Orlando Jones , due in June . The channel is weighing a pilot for Nip/Tuck , a drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in general is ( mess ) with convention , " says programming chief Kevin Reilly .

South Park spawned a 1999 feature film that grossed $ 52 million domestically and got an Oscar nomination for best song . And Comedy , then available in 38 million homes , now reaches 82 million .
