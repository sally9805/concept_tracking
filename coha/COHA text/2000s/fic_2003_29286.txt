Chapter One Thyme heals all wounds . - Anonymous Hey , China , what 's that you 're planting ? " Ruby Wilcox asked . I patted the dirt firmly around the base of the plant and straightened up . " It 's ginkgo , " I said . Ruby Wilcox is my best friend and partner . Her Crystal Cave , the only New Age shop in Pecan Springs , Texas , is in the same century-old stone building that houses my herb shop , Thyme and Seasons , and our jointly owned tearoom , Thyme for Tea . The building is surrounded with herb gardens , and at this moment , I was working in the garden out front . Thyme and Seasons and its herb gardens are a far cry from the Houston law office where I used to work as a criminal defense attorney . Leaving the law , moving to a small town , and opening my own business-these are the best things I 've ever done for myself ( second only to marrying Mike McQuaid , that is ) . And while some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and excitement , that has n't been a problem for me . Between the shop , my family , and my friends , I have just about all the excitement I can handle . And if I want to kick up my heels in the big city , it takes less than an hour to drive from Pecan Springs to either Austin or San Antonio . Altogether , it 's a nice arrangement . Ruby bent over to peer doubtfully at the plant . " That dinky little twig is ginkgo ? It 's got a heck of a lot of growing to do . The last ginkgo I saw was a tree . A big tree . " She looked up . " Taller than this building . " " Give it time , " I said with a grin , and picked up my shovel . " Like about five hundred years . I started this little guy from a cutting , and it 's got some growing to do . " The oldest surviving tree on earth , ginkgo was once described by Charles Darwin as a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ botanical features are still intact . Extracts made from its leaves have been used for over five thousand years to improve blood circulation , treat asthma and bronchitis , and enhance memory . And even if it were entirely useless , I would still enjoy the dappled shade created by its fan-shaped green leaves . While this little fellow begins stretching up to his full height , I 'm going to put up a sign letting people know that his ancestors were already ancient when humans were just beginning to rub sticks together . From the back door of the shop , my helper , Laurel Riley , waved at me . " You 're wanted on the phone , China , " she called . " It 's Hannah Bucher . " " Oh , good , " I said , shouldering my shovel and heading for the shop , Ruby tagging along behind . Hannah is a seventy-something herb gardener who lives in Cedar Crossing , not far away . She specializes in thyme , growing and selling dozens of different varieties of this beautiful herb . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lemon thyme , so I could try it in my garden . I 'd been waiting impatiently for her call . But Hannah had n't phoned to talk about herbs . Instead , she 'd called to ask me to come to Cedar Crossing to see her , and something in her voice prompted me to ask why . " It 's an urgent personal matter , " she said . She lowered her voice , as if she were afraid she might be overheard . " I hate to say it , China , but I 'm afraid someone is- " She stopped , and then in a lighter , brighter voice , went on : " I do hope you 'll be able to come and get those lemon thyme plants soon . I 've been saving them for you . When can you come ? " I glanced at the calendar . McQuaid and Brian-my husband and our thirteen-year-old-were going to Houston the next weekend to catch an Astros game . " How about Sunday ? " I asked . Ruby and I had been meaning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also live in Cedar Crossing . " Sunday would be fine . " Hannah 's voice became low and urgent again . " Unless you can come sooner . And please bring Ruby . I need to talk to both of you . " Frowning , I hung up and went to the door of the Crystal Cave . As usual , Ruby was burning her own handcrafted herbal incense , which creates a perfect backdrop for the tarot cards , rune stones , crystals , and books on astrology and the occult that she sells . " Want to drive over to Cedar Crossing on Sunday ? " I asked . Ruby pushed a curl of henna-red hair out of her eyes and looked up from the stack of books she was shelving . " Your plants are ready ? " " Yes , but that is n't why Hannah called . She wants to talk to us . It sounds like something 's wrong . " Ruby gave me a curious look . " What do you suppose is going on ? " " I do n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll find out on Sunday . " But Hannah never got a chance to tell us what was bothering her . On Friday , I learned that she was dead . " A heart attack ? " Ruby asked , her eyes widening when I told her . " That 's what the newspaper says . " I handed her the obituary that Ramona Pierce had clipped out of the Cedar Crossing Tattler and faxed to me . " Apparently , she died the day after we talked . She 's being buried tomorrow . " " What a shame , " Ruby said sadly . " Hannah was such a lovely , vibrant woman . I had no idea she had heart trouble . " " Neither had I. " I frowned , thinking about the tone of Hannah 's voice when she had said that she needed to talk to us , urgently . " What would you think about going to Cedar Crossing anyway ? I really would like to have those plants Hannah was saving for me . " " And I 'd like to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone . " Let 's do it . " Cedar Crossing is a pretty village , built on the bank of the Guadalupe River . Its chief claim to fame is a simple white-painted church with a delicate steeple , built by the German settlers who established the town 150 years ago . Hannah 's house and gardens were just down the road from the church . On Sunday afternoon , Ruby and I drove slowly past , admiring the sprays of bright foliage that spilled over the stone wall . The sunny yellow blooms of St. John 's wort were brilliant against the feathery purple leaves of a tall bronze fennel , and golden-leaved feverfew splashed at the foot of a sprawling gray-blue Russian sage . When I saw a woman pushing a wheelbarrow down the path , I pulled over and stopped . I studied her for a moment , then turned to Ruby . " I 'd like to talk to her , " I said . " But let 's pretend we do n't know anything about Hannah 's death . " Ruby gave me a curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know . " I shrugged . " Just a hunch , I guess . " Ruby grinned . She is the kind of person who always trusts a hunch . " Go for it , " she said . " Get that right brain in gear . " The woman behind the wheelbarrow was tanned and athletic-looking , with dark brown hair twisted into a loose , thick braid down her back . She wore a red bandana headband , a sweatshirt and jeans , and heavy garden gloves . Her face was stern and unsmiling . " Hi , " I said cheerfully . " I 'm China Bayles , and this is Ruby Wilcox . " The woman frowned . " China Bayles . Are n't you the person who wanted some of Hannah 's lemon thyme ? " " That 's me . Hannah said we could pick up the plants anytime . " I shaded my eyes with my hands and looked around . " Is she here ? " " Hannah 's dead . " The woman pressed her lips tightly together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand went to her mouth . " Oh , dear ! " she exclaimed , as if this were the first she 'd heard of it . " An accident ? " " They say it was a heart attack . " The woman 's voice was taut , and she was n't looking at us . " The funeral was yesterday . " She nodded in the direction of the church . " She 's buried in the churchyard . " " I am so sorry , " I said quietly . " Hannah was a lovely person . " I looked around the garden , which must have covered at least two acres . The fragrance of honeysuckle and roses surrounded us . " It 's so sad to think that she wo n't be here to take care of this beautiful garden . I hope the next person who owns it will love it as much as she did . " The woman 's eyes flashed an enigmatic message . " I 'll take care of it , " she said roughly . " I promised Hannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a big job , " I said . " It takes a lot of skill and knowledge . You really have to love it . " " That 's why Hannah did what she did , " the woman said . She turned toward the house and a look of something like hatred crossed her face . " And no matter what they say , " she burst out passionately , " she wanted me to have it after she died . " " Who do you suppose ' they ' are ? " Ruby whispered to me as the woman strode away , pushing her wheelbarrow . " And who is she ? " " I have no idea , " I said . I glanced toward the house . Another woman , short and plump and wearing a blue apron , was standing on the back porch , under the golden tangle of hops vines that covered the roof . At one time , Hannah had brewed her own beer , and had even given lectures on the subject . The woman saw us and beckoned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruby . " Maybe she knows what 's going on . " " You must be China and Ruby , " the woman said as we approached the porch . " Aunt Hannah told me you might be here . " She bit her lip . " I suppose you know that she died several days ago . " The kitchen was almost as pretty as the garden , with a cheerful red-checked cloth on the table and windowsills filled with pots of scented geranium . The woman introduced herself as Luella Mitchell , Hannah 's niece . As we sat at the table and sipped glasses of iced tea , she told us about the circumstances of Hannah 's death . " It was very sudden , " she said . Her round face was sad . " And quite unexpected . I 've lived with my aunt for the past three years and even helped take care of her accounts , and I never even suspected that she had a bad heart . " She sat down at the kitchen table and pulled a tissue out of her apron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to accept . " I leaned forward . " Hannah told me that she wanted to talk to me about an urgent matter . She sounded terribly troubled . Do you know what was bothering her ? " Luella 's face tightened . " I certainly do , " she said . " She was afraid . " " Afraid ? " Ruby put down her glass . " Of that woman you were talking to , out there in the garden . Jessica Powell , her name is . " Luella shook her head sadly . " Jessica killed somebody once , you know . She spent a long time in jail . " " She did ? " Ruby breathed . Luella nodded soberly . " Aunt Hannah realized that she 'd made a dangerous mistake , giving Jessica a job and letting her live in the garage apartment . And worse , putting her into her will . The woman has a green thumb , there 's no doubt about that . But she moved in and just took over . " She shook her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her own garden ! " " It 's true , then , that Jessica Powell will inherit this place ? " I asked , remembering what the woman had said . Luella 's face was set . " Aunt Hannah called you , China , because she wanted some legal advice . She 'd finally got up the courage to get rid of Jessica . But she died before she could change her will , so I guess- " She was interrupted by a knock on the screen door . We turned to see two uniformed police officers standing on the porch . " We 're looking for Miz Mitchell , " one of them said through the screen . " Hannah Bucher 's niece . " " That 's me . " Luella stood , her face suddenly apprehensive . " Is there something the matter ? " " Afraid so , ma'am . " The officer held out a paper . " We have a warrant to search the residence of Jessica Powell . " " My apartment ? " Jessica Powell asked angrily . She had suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? " " Please show us your living quarters , Miz Powell , " the officer said without answering her question . The two men followed her through the garden , in the direction of the two-story garage . " Why have they come ? " Luella asked in a bewildered voice . " What are they looking for ? " " Evidence , " I said . " They could n't have gotten a warrant unless they had probable cause to suspect that Jessica Powell had committed a crime . " Ruby 's eyes were large . " Murder ? " she whispered . " No , no ! " Luella exclaimed . " That 's wrong ! Aunt Hannah had a heart attack ! " " We 'll just have to wait and see , " I said grimly . Fifteen minutes later the officers were back . Jessica Powell was with them , stony-faced and silent-and handcuffed . " But I do n't understand ! " Luella exclaimed . " Why are you arresting her ? What 's she done ? " One officer gave her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the one to tell you this , Miz Mitchell , but your aunt did n't die of natural causes . The autopsy report you requested indicates that she was poisoned . " " Poisoned ! " Luella whispered . " But ... but how ? What kind of poison ? " The other deputy held up a plastic evidence bag . " Nicotine , " he said . In the bag was a can of smoking tobacco . " Nicotine poisoning ? " Ramona Pierce asked blankly . " I 've never heard of such a thing . " " I have , " Barbara Thatcher said in a grim voice . " Wicked stuff . Terribly toxic . " It was Sunday evening , and Ruby and I and our two hostesses were seated at the table in the dining room of Ramona and Barbara 's home , finishing a wonderful dinner of fresh garden vegetables and penne pasta with herbs-one of Barbara 's specialty recipes . It was a pretty room , with a pair of French doors that opened out onto a patio bordered with rosemary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's garden . The two women had bought the house together the previous year . Barbara practices law in San Antonio , and Ramona has her own interior decorating business.I nodded , agreeing with Barbara . " Tobacco is toxic , all right . It 's one of our most problematic herbs . " Ruby looked up from her plate . " You 're saying that tobacco is an herb ? " " Sure , " I said . " It 's a member of the nightshade family , like peppers , tomatoes , and eggplant-and potatoes , too . " I forked up a few veggies to demonstrate . " Over the centuries , tobacco has been used to treat all kinds of ailments , including cancer . But it is most definitely toxic . " Ramona frowned . " I know that cigarettes are bad news , but- " " It 's not just cigarettes , " Barbara said . " When I was in the DA 's office , we prosecuted a case where the killer poisoned his victim with a nicotine-based pesticide . " " Gardeners sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " Some people have been accidentally poisoned just by getting it on their hands . " Barbara looked at me curiously . " So the police , acting on a tip , searched Jessica Powell 's room ? " " And found the tobacco can , " Ruby said . " They think she made a nicotine concentrate and somehow administered it to Hannah . In her coffee , maybe , or in some strong-tasting food , like chili . " " But why ? " Ramona asked , frowning . " Everyone liked Hannah . We 'll all miss her . " " Because Jessica was the beneficiary of her will , " I said . " And Hannah had become afraid of her and was planning to change it , " Ruby explained . " Jessica must have realized what Hannah had in mind , and decided to take action . " Barbara raised her eyebrows . " Hannah was planning to alter her will ? " " That 's why she called China , " Ruby explained . Continues ...    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
