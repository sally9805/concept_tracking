Last week my friend Laura showed up at my front door , pushing her three-month-old son in his stroller . " I 'm really ... whatchamacallit , " she said . " Tired ? " I asked her . " The baby 's not ... you know . " " Sleeping ? " I asked . Laura 's eyes had that familiar pinwheeling quality I remembered from my own first months of motherhood  --  that hallucinatory period when a mother 's heart is opened wide , even as her eyelids flutter shut . No matter what the poets say about the ethereal joys of parenthood , any exhausted parent knows it is hard to concentrate on anything  --  sex , eating , finally changing out of your sweatpants  --  if you 've become a sleep junkie , jonesing for some REMs . The key for parents ' getting some sleep is first getting the baby to sleep  --  an eternal problem that has spawned all manner of programs , products and mother-in-law 's parenting tips . <P> Modern baby-sleep methodologies fall into two mutually exclusive camps : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pediatric sleep specialist and author of Solve Your Child 's Sleep Problems , which uses scientific-looking charts and graphs to prove that parents should let their babies cry themselves to sleep . In the other corner of the nursery are William and Martha Sears , authors of The Baby Book . The Searses are proponents of holding , swaddling , nursing and co-sleeping in the family bed . Both sides offer plenty of advice , and both are quite dogmatic . It 's my feeling that sleepless parents should do whatever works , borrowing as necessary from both camps . <P> The tone parents set when Baby is six to 12 months old will probably dictate a child 's sleep patterns well into childhood . Parents who sleep with their babies in the connubial bed will enjoy a rare period of closeness and ease during the first few months of life . ( This ended for me the night my baby decided to pluck out my eyelashes . ) If parents or baby do n't sleep well in a shared bed , they should n't share it . <P> No matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time when it must end . Parents should take the long view : unless they want to be sharing their bed with a thrashing two-year-old or negotiating with a recalcitrant four-year-old , they should move Baby to a crib by about age five months . <P> Ferber 's cry-it-out method asks parents to listen to their baby cry for longer and longer intervals of time , starting at five minutes , before going into the room . The idea is that babies need to learn how to fall asleep on their own  --  without parental intervention in the form of rocking or nursing . For every parent who has told me that this seems hardhearted , another has sheepishly said it worked like a charm after a few nights . <P> Whatever parents choose to do , they should provide a calm , warm and consistent bedtime ritual that is easy to adhere to , remembering that a baby who is well rested with daytime naps is usually a better sleeper at night . They should steel themselves to hear some crying as Baby settles in , but be ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use the literature as a guide but must always trust their instincts above any expert 's ( including this one ) . No one knows your own baby better than you do , awake or  --  one hopes  --  asleep . <P> For more information on both sleeping-baby strategies , visit
