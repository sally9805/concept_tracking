Just after finishing his new movie about the aftermath of the massacre at the Munich Olympics , Steven Spielberg talked with TIME movie critic Richard Schickel , who collaborated with him on the TV documentary Shooting War , about his reasons for taking on Munich , his anger at the International Olympic Committee and his modest plan for improving Arab-Israeli relations . <P> TIME : WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT THIS MOVIE IS , IN THE END , ABOUT THE HUMAN COST OF A QUAGMIRE ? Yes . And also for me this movie is a prayer for peace . I always kept thinking about that as I was making it . Somewhere inside all this intransigence there has to be a prayer for peace . Because the biggest enemy is not the Palestinians or the Israelis . The biggest enemy in the region is intransigence . Do you know Amos Oz 's books ? There 's a wonderful quote we found , that sort of makes sense to me : " In the lives of individuals , and of peoples , too , the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are persecuted . " They see in each other 's faces a reflection of some larger oppressor . That may well be the case with the 100-year conflict between Arabs and Jews . <P> DO YOU THINK THIS FILM WILL DO ANY GOOD ? I 've never , ever made a movie where I said I 'm making this picture because the message can do some good for the world  --  even when I made Schindler 's List . I was terrified that it was going to do the opposite of good . I thought perhaps it might bring shame to the memory of those who did n't survive the Holocaust  --  and even worse to those who did . I made the picture out of just pure wanting to get that story told . I thought it was important that at least my kids someday could see what happened , just to hear that story being told . I feel the same way about Munich . I do n't think any movie or any book or any work of art can solve the stalemate in the Middle East today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's worth a try . I did n't make this movie to make money , and I do n't know if I 've made a commercial movie at all . But I certainly feel that if filmmakers have the courage to talk about these issues  --  whether they 're fictional representations of real events or are pure fiction or pure documentaries  --  as long as we 're willing to talk about the real tough , hard subjects unsparingly , I think it 's a good thing to get out in the ether . It 's not a bad thing . And there 's a project I 'm initiating next February that I think might also do some good . <P> WHAT 'S THAT ? What I 'm doing is buying 250 video cameras and players and dividing them up , giving 125 of them to Palestinian children , 125 to Israeli kids , so they can make movies about their own lives  --  not dramas , just little documentaries about who they are and what they believe in , who their parents are , where they go to school , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what CDs they listen to  --  and then exchange the videos . That 's the kind of thing that can be effective , I think , in simply making people understand that there are n't that many differences that divide Israelis from Palestinians  --  not as human beings , anyway .
