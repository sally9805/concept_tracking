<p> Poneman remembers well her mother 's reaction when she , then a 17-year-old Skokie girl , announced her decision to renounce meat . " Mom said , without missing a beat , ' That 's nice , but Daddy has some skirt steaks on the grill , so why do n't you wait and start tomorrow ? ' " <p> " Well , I started ' tomorrow , ' and now it 's been 35 years , " Poneman said , laughing , in a recent interview . And although her mother  --  like many parents  --  feared for her vegetarian daughter 's health , it soon became apparent there was no need to worry . <p> " A teenage girl needs about 44 grams of protein a day 45 to 59 grams for teen males , which is very , very easy to accumulate in the course of a day , " Poneman said . " A cup of cooked black beans has 15 grams . A cup of cooked tempeh , the soy-based meat substitute , has 28 grams . Even a cup of cooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is all cholesterol-free and fat-free . " <p> That 's reassuring  --  but stoking the teenage growth machine with sufficient calories and nutrients is more complicated than just tracking protein intake . " What you do n't want is a kid switching from broiled chicken to cheese fries , " said Linda Van Horn , a registered dietitian and prominent researcher on childhood obesity who is professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University 's Feinberg School of Medicine . <p> " It 's important to learn the basic rules and principles of complementary proteins see accompanying story and have those in mind , " she said , noting that protein needs may go up to 55 grams for women and 70 for men who are active . <p> " And growing teens often need more than 2,500 calories a day , " she said . " So finding adequate calories can be a challenge for some , especially if they 're vegans ; for lacto-ovo vegetarians , that is much easier to achieve . " <p> But teen vegetarians are still teenagers . " Left to their own devices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more fries . If you want those kids to eat healthfully , you have to have healthful stuff around for them . " <p> That means handy snack selections like peanut butter with whole-grain bread , yogurt , juices , cheese , dried fruits , nuts , hard-cooked or deviled eggs if the kids like them  --  and most of all , fresh fruits and vegetables , ready to grab and eat . <p> " Given what we know about what kids actually eat and the rates of childhood obesity , teenagers who eat vegetarian are likely to have the same issues other kids have , and that 's insufficient vegetables and fruits , " said Van Horn , a butcher 's daughter who went vegetarian when her college dorm 's " mystery meat " seemed a little too mysterious . <p> School food still can be a problem , says Robin Seaman , a 16-year-old junior at Evanston Township High School . " It 's impossible to get a balanced lunch at school , " said Seaman , a vegan who eats no meat , fish or dairy products . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bagels and chips . Sometimes there are apples . " <p> " Even on days that are n't too busy , it 's hard to find protein , " she added . " Sometimes I grab a peanut-butter sandwich , but I mostly live off of carbs . " <p> Yet expert opinion does favor vegetarians . Indeed , " vegetarian diets appear to offer some nutritional advantages for adolescents , " says the American Dietetic Association 's current position paper on vegetarianism , which estimates 2 percent of the nation 's 6- to 17-year-olds are vegetarian . <p> Growth in vegetarian and non-vegetarian youngsters is comparable , the ADA says , and " vegetarian children and adolescents have lower intakes of cholesterol , saturated fat , and total fat and higher intakes of fruits , vegetables , and fiber than nonvegetarians . " <p> Better yet , " vegetarian adolescents are reported to consume more fiber , iron , folate , vitamin A , and vitamin C than nonvegetarians , " the ADA says . " Vegetarian adolescents also consume more fruits and vegetables and fewer sweets , fast foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With health benefits this clear , a fashion statement may not be far behind . " Our most recent numbers show that 30 percent of teen girls say being vegetarian is ' in , ' " said senior trends manager Rob Callender of Teenage Research Unlimited , a Northbrook-based market-research firm . " That does n't mean that 30 percent of girls are involved in the activity ... But it 's definitely not going to give a girl an image problem . " <p> Trouble may arise at home , however . " Raising teenagers is not easy , and I can see how parents might get upset at the idea of their child rejecting something so fundamental as the family 's diet , " said John Cunningham , consumer product research manager for the Vegetarian Resource Group ( VRG ) , a source of information , recipes and other support  --  including a chat group for vegetarians ' parents  --  at www.vrg.org . <p> As one suburban parent said : " It just gets on your last nerve ! " <p> Still , " when young people make this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marla Rose , a Chicago vegetarian activist and author of Marla 's Vegan Guide to Chicago &; the Universe ( Vegan Street Books , 2004 ) , an excellent sourcebook of restaurants and organizations for vegans . <p> " My parents were both kind of annoyed , " Rose recalled , when she decided at 15 to go vegetarian . " There was a bit of rebellion there , but at the same time I was dissecting animals in biology , and I just did n't want to eat them any more . For a long time I was a ' pasta-tarian , ' she added with a laugh , " but it was the best choice I ever made . " <p> Twenty years later , compassion for animals still leads many to vegetarianism . VRG 's research shows vegetarians cite three main concerns  --  ethical , environmental , or health  --  and vegetarians say the first two are most likely to motivate teens . New , young vegetarians are responding to news reports and books such as Eric Schlosser 's Fast Food Nation , which publicize exploitation of animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in factory-like conditions . <p> That 's what moved Sophia Magnone of Chicago 's Irving Park neighborhood . " I became a vegetarian just before my sophomore year of high school , " at age 15 , she said . " I started out still eating dairy products and eggs , but gradually started cutting those out and became completely vegan just after my 18th birthday . " <p> Now 19 and a sophomore at Pomona College in California , Sophia eased the transition by researching ethical and environmental issues  --  and by stepping into the kitchen . " I remember her not being able to cook , " her 12-year-old sister , Celia , said . " And then she decided to be vegetarian and she was , like , cooking magically . " <p> Their working mom , Sonya Booth , thought it was pretty magical when Sophia took over dinner duty . " I really appreciated that , " Booth said , " because I 've heard so many parents complain that they 're expected to make a separate meal for the ' special ' kid . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says her favorite meal is her sister 's vegan chili . " I love making soups and stir-fry things  --  stuff where you have to cut up a lot of vegetables , " Sophia said . <p> Yet that 's just the kind of time-consuming preparation that can make vegetarian cooking intimidating for busy families . Poneman understands , and her book is aimed at helping the whole family . <p> A youngster who decides to go vegetarian , Poneman said , " is giving the parent a great opportunity to be there for your child . When they 're little , you take care of everything ; then as teenagers , they separate and want to be independent . When they become vegetarians , they need you again  --  to support their decision , to reinforce their values , and to help them stay well-fed . " <p> Not that she makes it a mission . " I 'm not a natural cook ; I 'm the queen of substitutions , " Poneman confessed , and these are offered liberally and helpfully in her book . She and her co-author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this book because my kids ' friends loved eating at my house , even though there was never any meat . They 'd go home and ask their parents if they could have what Mrs. Poneman makes . " <p> Turns out there 's no secret to Mrs. Poneman 's cooking . " I make what everyone eats  --  spaghetti , chili , normal food , just without meat . I do n't make anything incredibly special . My kids love pigs in blankets , made with soy dogs and those crescent rolls in the little can you pop . It 's vegetarian , but it 's familiar .
