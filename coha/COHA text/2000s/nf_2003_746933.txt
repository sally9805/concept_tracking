Honey bee hives from Maine to California are abuzz with news about a new food that originated from a chance conversation between two ARS scientists . At an Entomological Society of America meeting in the summer of 2001 , entomologists Gloria DeGrandi-Hoffman , who specializes in honey bee research , and Allen C. Cohen , who is internationally recognized for his pioneering work with foods for insects , met and discussed a problem that has plagued California 's almond growers for years . <p> These orchardists , producers of the nation 's $1 billion almond crop , need bustling colonies of honey bees  --  alive with strong workers and healthy young , known as brood  --  to pollinate their vast orchards during the winter months . That 's the time of year these trees begin to flower . But it 's also when bees are in a near-hibernating state and not being very industrious . <p> Cohen and DeGrandi-Hoffman , now research leader at the ARS Carl Hayden Bee Research Center , Tuscon , Arizona , decided to collaborate in developing a recipe for an artificial diet that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need in an easily digestible liquid . This would keep the bees rearing brood and ready to work once the almond blossoms appear . <p> Presently , beekeepers use soy patties to feed bees during winter , before almond blossoms  --  floral treasure troves of pollen and nectar  --  are readily available . The major problem with these patties is that they are costly and labor-intensive . Beekeepers must either go from hive to hive and manually insert the patties or place large tubs of the dry patty mix near their beehives . <p> The patties  --  typically made of corn syrup , soy flour , and brewer 's yeast  --  create another problem . For reasons not yet understood , bees that eat soy patties eventually lose their ability to produce a food , called worker jelly , that 's vital for the brood . <p> With a liquid diet , a machine already used by beekeepers would be able to easily pump the bee food into the hives , a far less labor-intensive approach , says Cohen . He recently retired from the ARS Biological Control and Mass Rearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late 1980s , he was stationed at the Bee Research Center and worked with DeGrandi-Hoffman there . <p> Cohen started with an existing diet that he created for indoor rearing of lygus bugs . It was patented by USDA in 2000 . To meet the needs of beekeepers , he converted the lygus bug food from solid to liquid , blending ingredients that provide vital nutrients . <p> Cohen wanted to create a formula that would combine the sweetness of nectar and the nutritional punch of pollen into a digestible , absorbable food that bees would gobble up . <p> Nectar is rich in carbohydrates . Pollen is packed with protein , vitamins , minerals , fats , and perhaps as-yet-undiscovered compounds essential for bees ' survival . <p> " What we did n't know is whether bees would be able to take a liquid that combined the qualities of both nectar and pollen and process it in such a way that the formula would be completely nutritious for them , " says Cohen . " That was really one of the most exciting possibilities  --  to see whether we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Cohen 's classic recipe , modified slightly , thus became the Arizona lab 's starting point for a new menu option for domesticated honey bees , Apis mellifera . <p> With Cohen 's formula in hand , DeGrandi-Hoffman and Gordon I. Wardell , an entomologist and corporate collaborator at Tucson , mixed batches of the creamy-white liquid for bees to taste-test . <p> The intent was to create an elixir so delectable that adult bees would not only eagerly eat it but would also , as is their usual practice , store some of it in the hive for nurse bees  --  the hive 's round-the-clock nannies  --  to feed to the colony 's brood . <p> For the investigations , Wardell assembled 12 small hives , then enclosed them with netting so bees could n't sneak out during the tests to bring their familiar foods back to the hive . Each hive housed about 3,500 to 4,000 bees . " We offered the bees one kind of food  --  either sugar-water , pollen , or the new liquid , which we poured into petri dishes , " says Wardell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new concoction . <p> To make it more appetizing , the researchers launched a series of new experiments , presenting variations of the baseline recipe for the bees ' approval . The scientists structured these experiments so that despite natural variations from one six-legged taste-tester to the next , the findings would be statistically sound . <p> After 5 months and nearly 80 reformulations , the team hit on an apparently scrumptious creation that the finicky bees just could n't resist . The scientists then tested it in full-size hives , each accommodating about 30,000 bees . Wardell and co-worker Fabiana Ahumada-Segura fitted each hive with a small window so that they could spy on the dining bees . <p> " At one point , " says Wardell , " we saw 75 to 100 bees jammed around a petri dish , pushing and shoving each other to get to the food . In the commotion , some of the bees fell into the petri dish . It was like a bee mud-wrestling match . " <p> Adds Cohen , " This is somewhat historic because people have tried for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were unable to get the bees to continue to rear brood on those formulas . With the new diet , bees have been able to rear continuous generations of brood . " <p> To see whether the new culinary offering would please bees elsewhere , Wardell sent samples to commercial beekeepers in Arizona , California , Georgia , Maine , Michigan , New Mexico , and Pennsylvania . " All the beekeepers reported that their bees liked this recipe , " Wardell says . " One beekeeper asked an assistant to take a ruler out to a hive and measure how much food was left after the bees had about 4 hours to try it out . To their amazement , all the food was gone . " <p> More work is needed , however , before the experimental food is ready for commercial and hobbyist beekeepers to use . " We want to cut the cost so the food is affordable , " Wardell explains . " We 're using very pure , pricey ingredients , but we intend to substitute less-expensive compounds . " The scientists also aim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be cheaper to ship . <p> Further fine-tuning of the formula may boost brood survival rates and lengthen adult bees ' typical 4-week life-span . Currently , both these measures are about the same among bees reared on pollen patties and those fed the novel food . <p> Another planned upgrade : compounds known as feeding stimulants that may entice bees to eat even more . Though these are already standard ingredients in other foods formulated for nourishing beneficial insects , apparently no one yet knows which feeding stimulants would appeal to honey bees . <p> The researchers intend to seek a patent for their bee cuisine . <p> This research is part of Crop Protection and Quarantine ( #304 ) and Crop Production ( #305 ) , two ARS National Programs described on the World Wide Web at www.nps.ars.usda.gov . <p> Gloria DeGrandi-Hoffman is at the USDA-ARS Carl Hayden Bee Research Center , 2000 E.
