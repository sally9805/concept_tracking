Inspecting the baseball-making factory in Costa Rica , THE SPORTING NEWS comes away with no evidence Headnote the ball is being juiced ( the homer explosion to the contrary ) - and an appreciation for the exacting process of turning cowhide , yarn , thread and a rubbery core into an object bearing Allan H. Selig 's signature By Stan McNeal // You fly to Costa Rica , home of active volcanoes rain forests and the only factory in the world the makes major league baseballs . You drive through congested streets , past historic ruins , up mountains and through fog to reach Turrialba , the small town that is home to Rawlings de Costa Rica S.A ( secured area ) . You do this because you hope to find out if major League baseballs are juiced . In ballparks everywhere , balls are jumping off bats like they are loaded with a Costa Rican coffee bean . Photograph // So you listen to Sandy Alderson , the executive vice president of baseball operations , who has just made his first visit to the Rawlings plant . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly does not appear there have been any significant changes that would lead to a difference in the playing characteristics of the ball compared to last September , " he says . Then you take the tour . For nearly three hours , Rawlings president Howard Keene , Turrialba plant manager Doug Kralik and his wife , Diane , the plant 's quality-control officer , walk you through the process . Step by step . They answer every question , point out every inspection , try to quell every doubt . They , too , are convincing . If Rawlings has something to hide , then why would it send its president down from St. Louis to conduct a media tour ? Still , you 're skeptical . You have seen the numbers : three home run records , and the season is barely two months old . On April 7 , there were 57 homers , an average of almost four a game . Six grand slams were hit on one day ( May 21 ) , and there were 931 home runs in April . Teams have hit back-to-back-toback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that bad . It must be the balls . But the Rawlings people tally to straightforwardly , too sincerely , to lead you astray . The Turrialba plant is producing baseballs to the same specifications major league baseball has requested since way before Rawlings got the contract in 1977 . And it is producing 1.2 million of them a year . Balls must weigh 5 to 51/4 ounces , measure 9 to 91/4 inches in circumference and pass a dozen inspections before being boxed up and shipped to the United States . You see a crate full of boxed baseballs , and they appear fine . They 're not humming or vibrating or anything . Rawlings starts from Tullahoma , Tenn. , just as they always have been . One side of a cow yields as many as 50 ball covers , Kralik says . You touch the hide , and it feels smooth , but not slick . Other than some tanning chemicals that bleach the hide snow-white , Kralik says nothing is put on the hide , not this year , not any year . It is easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " dampening room , " where the cowhide covers are moistened in damp cloths to soften them for sewing . " Determi when a ball has the right pliability is an art form , " says Kralik , his arm proudly wrapped around the supervisor who makes that determination . There 's no juicing being done in this room , you conclude . From the dampening area , Kralik leads you into the large " sewing room . " This , he says , is the " heart of the operation . " It is an impressive sight to see 500 people steadily stitching balls , using nothing but two blunt needles , waxed thread , a vise to hold the ball and their bare hands . From 7 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. , they hunch over and go to work , making between 20 and 50 balls a day , depending on their ability . By watching the balls being hand-sewn , you are able to forget the speculation that machines are being used to do the stitching , which would be one way of making them livelier . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not doing anything differently this year . They do n't even know what a juiced ball is . Most are in their late teens or early 20s . Half are women . They make a minimum of $1.10 an hour , and they earn incentives for stitching more than 150 balls a week . Very few follow baseball . The people who do the stitching would have a practical reason for wanting the balls to be juiced : their jobs . Lively balls would mean a need for more balls , which would result in more work and more pay . Ball production has shot up faster than ERAs in recent years . Kralik estimates that his factory is producing 12,000 more balls a week this year than it did the season before the strike of 1994 . Stitchers sit in rows based on their production , new guys at the back and " Club 200 " at the head of the room . Marco Rodriguez sits proudly in the seat reserved for the No. 1 stitcher . He says he has been sewing baseballs for 11 years at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not even Mark McGwire can match that production . A Mets fan , Rodriguez follows baseball and embraces his job like few others , according to Keene . Photograph NO JUICE HERE : A trip to the Rawlings factory in Turrialba can be more than convincing . // " There is no difference ( in the ball ) . The process is the same , " Rodriguez says . Besides , if the balls are being stitched tighter , would n't there be leftover thread at the end ? It is the same length-88 inches-as always , and you do n't see extra thread hanging out of any baseballs . Still , you are not sure . You hear the story of Diamondbacks pitching coach Mark Connor being able to stick his hand in a bucket and , without looking , separate this year 's balls from the 1999 balls every time . You remember Padres pitching coach Dave Smith telling you that yes , the consensus around baseball is that the ball has changed . After baseballs leave the sewing area , they are spun around in a machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This flattens the seams to the same consistency on every ball . When you hold a ball before and after it has been rolled , you notice a difference . The seams on the unrolled ball are noticeably higher and would favor the pitcher . Maybe this rolling step is the difference . Seams that have been lowered certainly would make it more difficult for a pitcher to do what he wants with the ball . Is this a new step ? Has it somehow changed ? Kralik says no , balls have been rolled like this since the beginning . Balls then move to the " drying room , " an airconditioned , dehumidified area where they dry out from the effects of the dampening room . There is a " do not touch " sign in this room . If you ca n't touch , then you ca n't juice , you figure . Photograph NOTHING TO HIDE : In an effort to end speculation about production changes juicing-up the baseball , Rawlings president Howard Keene ( left ) and plant manager Doug Kralik ( above ) opened their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate for a long time Whenever offensive production goes up , the baseball is blamed . There are many excerpts from the library of THE SPORTING NEWS accusing and defending the ball through the years : 1921 Julian Curtiss , president of A.G. Spalding &; Bros. , in a letter to N.L , president John Heydler . " Many letters have came to my desk , and I have also read in the papers various articles in regard to the free hitting that is going on this year in the major leagues , and giving as a reason therefore that the ball we are furnishing is much livelier than in the past . Permit me to state most emphatically that there has been no change made in the manufacture of this ball . " 1938 Two dozen players , 500 fans and several league officials gather at Oriole Park in Baltimore to watch top sluggers hit the relatively dead ball retained by the N.L. and the lively ball retained by the A.L . The conclusion , according to reporter Randall Cassell : " Both will travel over the fences when hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead ' sound coming off the bat . " 1947 Stan Musial , Cardinals first baseman : " The ball definitely is livelier . It goes farther Clyde Vollmer of the Reds hit one on top of that laundry across the street in left field at Cincy ; ( Johnny ) Mize belted one clear over the Giants ' bullpen at the Polo Grounds and , even though I did n't get a full swing , l sent one about 400 feet , a shade to the left of center . " Ben Chapman , Phillies manager . " Take one look at the batting averages on my club and you wo n't say the ball is any livelier . " ( The Phils hit an N.L.-low .258 in ' ' 47. ) 1948 Bucky Harris , Yankees manager : " They have done something to the ball . Men who used to find it tough to drive a ball 350 feet now send it 450 feet . Joe DiMaggio is being run ragged out in the distance every day " Connie Mack , Philadelphia A 's manager . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been changed . They raise that cry every spring . " 1950 Headline on the front page of THE SPORTING NEWS : " It 'S Putrid Hurling , Not Rabbit In Ball " 1956 George Dawson , vice president of Spalding : " Talk about a rabbit ball is nothing new to the manufacturers . I visited with Warren Giles , president of the National League , in May . He inquired about the baseball . Mr. Giles said he had reports that there was more jackrabbit in the ball . I informed him that the 1956 baseball is being made of the same materials we have been using for a long , long time . " 1961 Ford Frick , baseball commissioner : " In the old days , everyone would be on his feet when a homer was hit . Today , unless a homer 's been hit by a player challenging ( Babe ) Ruth 's record , the fans just sit on their hands . If so many home runs are hit that the fans lose interest , well , that could be a danger . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball and the one Ruth hit are identical . " 1970 Leo Durocher , Cubs manager . " The ball not only seemed smaller and lighter than the 1969 ball , but the pitchers tell me that the stitching was tighter and the seams were n't as raised as the other ball . " Hank Aguirre , veteran pitcher : " If they want all that hitting , why do n't they just put the ball on a tee and let the batters whack away at it ? Then they 'll soon have scores like 19-16 and 30-28 , and the people will soon get sick of that . " 1973 Because of a lack of quality horsehide , Bowie Kuhn announces that baseball will begin using cowhide covers for the first time in 1974 . Reds catcher Johnny Bench later will say of the new balls : " I could almost peel the cover off them . ft you grip them hard enough and twist the seams seem to give . And the dirt scuffs it easier . Whitey Ford would have loved to pitch with these new balls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " With these new balls , Fenway Park in Boston will resemble a softball held , especially if they ever allow aluminum bats . " With both leagues on record paces for home runs , the N.L. and A.L . ask a math professor at the University of Missouri-Rolla to test the ball . The tests " demonstrated conclusively that the ball is more resilient than its predecessor but remains well within the specifications of baseballs produced in the same manner for many years . " ( The A.L . did set a record , since broken , with 2,013 homers in ' ' 77. ) 1986 Tony Kubek , announcer . " I throw batting practice once in a while , and you can hear it in the way balls whistle over your head in batting practice like they never did before . The balls are livelier Oh , I know the baseball company will deny it , but ... " Bob Burrows , Rawlings president : " Aw , Kubek talks about this every year He does n't know what he 's talking about The balls are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " 1987 Sparky Anderson , Tgers manager : " I know this : They are winding those babies differently . If this is the same ball the majors has always used , they 've added some gasoline to it . I do n't know who they 're trying to kid . " BLAME THE BALL : In 1961 scientists fired baseballs from an explosive-driven ram , trying to learn if that year 's ball was livelier than those used in the ' ' 20s. // The climate , however , could have a significant impact on a ball somewhere in the process , Keene acknowledges . He says when it is humid , scores on the resiliency tests performed on balls come in lower than in dry weather . So the wetter the weather , the deader the ball . But if this has been an especially dry season in the States , then you have n't noticed . Once the balls are dried , they are rolled again , weighed , cleaned and inspected . From here , it is decided which balls will go to the majors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tiniest flaw will cause a ball to be downgraded to " commercial " status . In an average week , about 40 percent of the balls produced at the factory do n't pass final inspection . They end up in batting practice or on sale in the stadium gift shop . After the balls are weighed , they are stamped with a blue major league logo and Allan H. Selig 's signature ( no " Bud " here ) instead of the signatures of the former league presidents . Some have speculated that the new stamping makes it easier for the hitter to pick up the spin on the ball . This is the one visible change in this year 's ball-so , as unlikely as it seems , you figure it 's possible . Stranger things have happened , like Giants pitcher Shawn Estes almost hitting two grand slams in one game last week . After they 're stamped , balls are weighed and inspected again before being hand-packed into a box that will be shipped to the United States . The tour also includes a stop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the tour off limits to photographers because Rawlings says it wants to keep its winding machines a secret from the competition . In this room , four layers of yarn are wrapped around the " pill , " the rubbery core of the ball that is slightly smaller than a Ping-Pong ball . The winding machines crank at a very high decibel level , 28 machines running at a time . The inspections during the winding process are so precise it would be too difficult to juice the ball at this step . After each layer of yarn is wound on the ball , it is weighed and measured . Within the target weight , there is a variance of .04 ounces-which is what , the weight of a strand of hair ? If the ball does n't fit inside the variance , it is kicked back . Now if Major League Baseball wanted to change the specs and juice a ball , it could do it in the winding room , With the balls wrapped a little tighter , they would become a little harder and fly off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not a physicist , but I think you could look at each component of how the ball is made and realize there could be ways to make slight changes , " he says . Keene , however , shoots down the possibility . " This place would have to shut down until we figured it out , " he says . " We 'd have to go back in and try to figure out what we did at every operation . " Producing a major league ball costs Rawlings about $4 , Keene says . Though virtually every ball for every other league is made in China , Rawlings decided to put a factory in Costa Rica in 1989 after leaving Haiti because of political unrest there . Even though production costs are much lower in China , Keene says , Rawlings came to Costa Rica because of a stable government and strong work force . More than 10 years later , Keene says the factory is producing at such an efficient , consistent level that " it 's almost boring . " " We 're not trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the wheel in the middle of the road , " he says . The only change in materials for the ball has been a switch from a horsehide cover to cowhide in 1974 because of a shortage of quality horsehide . But that happened before Rawlings got the contract away from Spalding in 1977 . The final stop of the tour brings you to the " testing room . " Around 28 balls out of 10,000 are tested here , which is a " significant statistical sampling , " according to Rawlings . More balls are tested in Ava , Mo. , after they are shipped out of Costa Rica . The test balls are aimed at a white ash board and shot out of a pitching machine at 85 mph . The ball 's speed coming off the board is measured and computed into the Coefficient of Restitution . Simply stated , if it ricochets off the board at a speed between 43.69 and 49.13 mph , it passes inspection . According to Rawlings , most of the balls tested today come in on the high end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing a better ball , better at least from the hitters ' standpoint . Consistently grading out on the high end could make a significant difference in the ball , though no one knows . " I think that 's one of the reasons Major League Baseball is getting some people at ( University of Massachusetts ) Lowell involved , " Keene says . " Not to come up with new specs but just to learn more about what some of the variations might mean . " The tour now over , you have learned a lot . Rawlings certainly makes a convincing case that there 's nothing different about the ball . But that does n't change the results on the playing field . And who 's to say , even if the balls are juiced , that baseball admit it ? That certainly would tarnish the statistics that have been piled up with the 2000 ball . Why should baseball even care if the ball is juiced ? After all , home runs are entertaining , and sports today are all about entertainment . Besides , the debate over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is up this year , and the threat of another strike wo n't begin until next season . Now if there were a shortage of home runs , then baseball would have reason for concern . If balls were n't flying out of parks at a dizzying rate , then you can bet officials would be making a bee-line to Costa Rica . " You 're right about that , " Keene says . And , for once , you are convinced . Stan McNeal is a managing editor for THE SPORTING NEWS . Photograph HE 'S GOT IT SEWN UP : Rodriguez , the No. 1 stitcher at the Rawlings factory , has been stitching baseballs for 11 years . " There is no difference ( in the ball ) , " he says . " The process is the same . " Sidebar Leaving them in stitches Though Rawlings welcomes any player to tour its Costa Rica factory , only one major leaguer has visited , according to plant manager Doug Kralik . Yankees starter Orlando " El Duque " Hernandez , who defected from Cuba through Costa Rica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good time they let him stitch his own ball . He still has it Of course , there 's not much else Rawlings could have done with it . " The boss said to me , you may be a good ballplayer , but you do n't know anything about making baseballs ; ' Hernandez says through an interpreter Even when he 's not pitching , Hernandez often can be seen with a baseball in his hands . He says he sometimes thinks of the factory workers as he carries around a ball . He made his visits before the 1998 and 1999 seasons . Maybe he should have returned this offseason . " Last year , they did a good job , the balls were softer , " he says , smiling . " But I did n't go this year . The balls are very hard this year We 've got to take the rabbit out of the ball . " Either that , or they could make the baseballs ripe way Hernandez made his . " If the baseballs were made the way I made it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - SM. // <p>
