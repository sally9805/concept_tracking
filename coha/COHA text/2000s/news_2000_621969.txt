<p> Elisabeth Daniel is cool , sophisticated and quiet . Yes , you heard correctly  --  quiet . It 's an oasis , a dramatic departure from the bombardment of open kitchens , loud music and pumped-up conversations that has come to characterize most new places . <p> This high-end restaurant , which features a six-course fixed-price menu for $68 , reflects the refined sensibilities of its owners , Elisabeth Ramsey and Daniel Patterson , the duo that brought Babette 's to Sonoma . <p> In five years there the owners earned a national reputation , and the small-town environment allowed Patterson to perfect his craft . When the couple lost their lease at Babette 's , they knew it was time to try their luck in San Francisco . <p> With only one investor , they sank their fortune into a tiny space in the Financial District on Washington Street , in the shadow of the Transamerica Pyramid . <p> The food crafted by Patterson is on the level of Gary Danko 's or Fifth Floor 's . Elisabeth Daniel is the culmination of Patterson 's passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked for any really big-name chefs , but spending about a third of his childhood in France introduced him to the pleasures of the table . <p> His sweetbread ravioli is a dish every bit as memorable as Paul Bocuse 's truffle soup covered with a puff pastry dome . A frothy yellow foam of mushrooms , butter and white wine covers the tender ravioli , with a thin slice of truffle showing through the mound in the center . The creamy-textured organ meat mixed with a chicken and foie gras mousse creates a combination that can make a diner feel giddy . <p> The rare ahi tuna , seared quickly in duck fat for added richness , is another tribute to Patterson 's talent . The rosy fish is suspended in a lemon and black pepper gelee , creating a cool , sensuous texture and explosive taste . <p> Other dishes may not be as notable by comparison , but they hold their own with just about anybody 's in town . It 's obvious that Patterson is shooting for a four-star rating , and in time he just may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support this more leisurely and refined style of dining . <p> Ramsey has an almost cosmic view of the restaurant : " I think life is just so overwhelming , there 's so much noise and visual clutter , that taking time out to have a quiet meal is an antidote , " she explains . <p> Ramsey , with the help of her architect friend Ken Frieders , designed the interior . The dining room has only 16 luxuriously spaced tables , outfitted with rich brocade cloths that brush the floor . <p> The high-backed chairs with a Japanese look , handmade service plates and domed porcelain candle holders concentrate attention on the table . Only sconces and three mirrors break up the expanse of soothing gray walls . A vibrant blue curved wall in back hides the kitchen , and an arched ceiling adds architectural interest to the intimate room . <p> The dinner menu , which changes slightly every night , features three choices in each course , including a vegetarian option . The meal may begin with three perfect spears of asparagus , with a pile of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frothy blanket of lemon sabayon over the middle . Another example : an eggshell filled with a green cloud of chive custard topped with a generous mound of beluga caviar . <p> The second course consists of a delicate but full-flavored consomme with a Japanese-like arrangement of shiitake , carrots , leek and celery root , brought to the table in a bowl . The broth is gently poured over the vegetables tableside . And then there 's the marvelous sweetbreads or medallions of foie gras that are uniquely paired with green apples and tamarind , leaving a sweet-and-sour aftertaste . <p> The third course includes a vegetarian dish that can wow even the most jaded gourmand : a snowy pile of hand-rolled couscous surrounded by a celery-scented broth fortified with a subtle dose of curry , and beads of squash , baby carrots , parsnips and celery root . Each grain is tender but separate , an amazing feat in a restaurant . <p> Another option : Monkfish medallions , stuffed at the core with fresh herbs , look like perfect coins of lobster and have an equally sweet taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main event is clearly reflected in the wild mushroom and squab sauce that pools around the fish . The meaty , salty complement allows the fish to be what it was meant to be without an army of supporting ingredients . <p> The duck featured in the fourth course illustrates Patterson 's preference for refined but simple presentations . Here four medallions of salt-crusted duck are fanned in a pool of duck and red wine sauce below two perfect quenelles of pureed carrot lightened with mascarpone . Another winner is a crisp oxtail galette seasoned with duck fat and truffle . The patty is breaded on one side with panko and sauteed before being presented with spring onions , green garlic and fava beans . <p> The cheese course consists of either a whipped Roquefort on poached pears , a chunk of L'Edel de Cleron with walnut bread and tiny greens or Chabichou , topped with tender , tiny shoots of cress . <p> For dessert , search no farther than the Meyer lemon souffle , a deliciously puffy monument to French technique . Patterson balances the intense flavor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more elaborate  --  such as the white chocolate charlotte , served with a triangle of frozen hazelnut chocolate mousse with a sun-dried cherry sauce  --  but are n't as inspired as the savory courses . The fruit soup with minute dices of exotic tropicals is refreshing and light . The one clunker : a warm rhubarb cake that tasted too eggy , even when tamed with a cooling ginger ice cream . <p> Just when you think you ca n't eat another bite , the waiter brings over a rectangular plate with three more treats : a coin of sour-apple gelee , a tiny Meyer lemon tart with delicate spikes of meringue and a rich chocolate truffle glazed in dark , glossy chocolate . <p> By the time you get to this point , you 've probably spent at least two hours at table , and that 's just fine with Patterson and Ramsey , who do n't seem the least bit concerned about turning tables . <p> " It takes time to be really human , and people seem to rush dining so much , " she says . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Daniel Patterson and Elisabeth Ramsey extends to the wine list . Patterson believes that high wine prices are " ungenerous , " so in most cases the markup is 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 times wholesale . <p> That 's exceptional , given the prime inventory collected by sommelier William Putman . But if diners want to splurge , the 1981 Chateau Margaux is $300 , the 1985 Chateau Lynch Bages $280 . <p> The list is n't unwieldy , even though it includes many multiple vintages , such as the 1995 and 1996 Stony Hill Chardonnay ( $45 , $42 ) . <p> Diners looking for Beaujolais ca n't do much better than the 1998 Clos de la Ruilette Fleurie ( $31 ) , or for Rose , the 1996 Chapoutier Tavel ( $39 ) . <p> Pinot Noir lovers will rejoice at the 36 selections that include six vineyard or vintage designations of Rochioli . There are other cult names , too : Flowers , Hanzell and Talisman , along with some great choices from other countries ( Floating Mountain from New Zealand and Louis Latour Corton Grancey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovers wo n't be shorted , either , with three vintages of Corison and two each of Etude , Livingston-Moffett and Peter Michael . <p> There are also some well-chosen half bottles , 14 wines by the glass and 20 dessert wines in a wide variety of styles . <p>  --  Michael Bauer <p> CHART : <p> ELISABETH DANIEL ADDRESS : 550 Washington St. ( between Sansome and Montgomery ) , San Francisco PHONE : ( 415 ) 397-6129 HOURS : Open for lunch 11:30 a.m. -2 p.m. weekdays , dinner 6-10 p.m. weekdays .
