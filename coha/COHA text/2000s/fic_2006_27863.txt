The Darkest Place By Judson , Daniel St. Martin 's Minotaur Judson , Daniel He did n't mind the cold . He was wearing his heavy Carhartt jacket and leather gloves and wool hat , the hat he had once seen in that movie about corruption among longshoremen , the one with Marlon Brando , the one from the fifties . What was that movie called ? He could n't remember . But he had liked the look of those hats , the look of the men who wore them . Tough , self-reliant , beat-but-still-standing . He liked that , wanted those who looked at him to see that , see a man still standing . As he drove his van through the dark he remembered that he had also liked the woman in the movie , the blonde in the white slip , the one with the sad eyes . He liked the way she looked , he liked her voice . There was something about it , something about her . He had been born in Brooklyn , lived in sight of those very docks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked like she had talked . He had n't ever known his father , did n't know what the man had done for a living back then , if the man had in fact been one of those men who worked the waterfront or had done something else to earn his money . But what that something could have been he did n't know . His father had left before he was born , and his mother had found a house farther out on the island , in the town of Riverhead . This was when he was four . He could barely remember that day , his firstin the new house . Men came and went . He remembered that . His mother never spoke of his old man , but there was n't a day when he did n't think about his father , about the things this unknown man might have done to survive , the places he might have lived in and the women he might have been with and maybe even loved in the years that followed his leaving them . He thought about that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at home , at night , down in his basement , and then later on in bed . He was thinking of all that now , as he steered his van through this cold night , looking calmly for a place to deposit the body . He had lifted weights before he left his house , the rusted bench press set up in the basement , beside the large furnace . The furnace worked continuously against the cold , against a wintry wind that pressed like a shoulder again and again against the windows , bending and rattling the panes . He could see through the small glass window in the hatch of the furnace the fire that raged inside . It was the only source of light , and he stared at it as he briefly rested between sets . He had made a point of doing slow , forced repetitions with heavy weight , filling his thick muscles with blood and raising his heart rate to one-twenty . This had warmed his core up plenty , and the engorged muscles in his torso , quivering beneath his jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed around him . Even after the half hour it took him to reach Hampton Bays , the van 's engine had yet to heat the radiator fluid enough to affect the heater coil . It was that cold outside , that raw . Arctic . The air rushing through the vents under the dashboard was still cold , but he did n't mind that . He liked the feel of it on his face . It was something for him to stand against , something to prove his resilience . And anyway , his heart and lungs and gut , the deepest parts of himself , only seemed warmer by contrast to what was touching his large , unshaven face like a dead hand . No , this cold was fine with him . He was a big man -- six-five , two-ninety . He was n't yet thirty . Beneath the heavy jacket he wore dirty coveralls , rarely wore anything else , even on his days off . This cold snap dropping into the double-digits-below when the sun went down , was only two days old . Before that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a mild November . The first day of winter was just a week away , but until two days ago , it had n't seemed really possible to him . Despite this sudden cold , he was n't worried that the bay would be frozen over . Even the lakes around town had yet to freeze . Only the small ponds on the back roads of Bridgehampton had a thin sheet over them . No , there was nothing for him to worry about , nothing to stand in his way . This was easy money . Easy money . He entered Hampton Bays from the north and headed his van east along Main Street . He drove slowly , the way he had driven in from Riverhead , through the desolation of the pine barrens . No need to attract the cops , though he was ready for what he 'd have to do if one dared to stop him . A few blocks east , in the heart of town , he turned the van south and headed through a working-class neighborhood called Ponquogue . It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't feel that he needed the protection that a later hour would afford him . He 'd done this before , was getting good at it , better and better each time . Besides , there was elegance in this , in what he was doing . There was elegance in his being daring , being efficient and confident . Elegance was a sad-eyed blonde in a slip , elegance was Brando in his checkered jacket , standing up , his face bloodied . This mattered to him , elegance . As he rode past the houses he knew that those hidden inside were watching television , just killing time till sleep called . Without straining he could see through the front windows , see from the corner of his eye the flickering blue light cast against the walls , the ever-moving shadows , action without motion . The people occupying these houses were getting fatter , he knew this , growing weaker by the day , wasting away as they waited on soft couches for their precious hours of unconsciousness . What was the point in living , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steered down the dark street he found himself looking at the upstairs windows , splitting his attention between them and the familiar road ahead . Some windows were dark , others lit . He watched them all as closely as he could , concentrating . One night not too long ago he had seen a woman crossing a well-lit bedroom , saw her turn and face the window just as he rode past . She was undressed . Lean and strong , from what he could see in the second or two that he had . She had aroused him , not only sexually but deep in his heart . He imagined her lonely , like he was . He imagined her seeking perfection in everything she did , defining herself with every gesture she made , the way he was trying to define himself by what he did . He thought of her working out every day , unashamed of her body , tending to it . Neat and clean . He thought of her with him , naked in his basement , on his bench , the heat from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flames reflecting off the sweat that covered their skin . . . He was more than what he seemed , much more , and the woman he would love would know that . He would know that about her , too . He would have her when he wanted , she would undress for him , without him having to ask . She would walk before him freely , never doubt him . She would have him , too , whenever she wanted , and he would walk before her for her to see . A few miles later he was pulling over to the side of the road . There were n't any houses here , just a wooded lot to the right and the shimmering edge of the bay on his left . He was focused now . Sharp . He killed the lights but left the motor running . He would n't be long . He got out and stepped around to the back , opening the rear doors and leaning in . The body wrapped up in the sheet of clear plastic had begun to stiffen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are heavy . But he curled more than that weight every other day , so his muscles did n't strain a bit as he pulled the body out and carried it to the water 's edge . He knelt , letting the body down onto the bank . With both hands he held the jagged edge of the plastic so the body unrolled down the bank and into the water . At this time of night Shinnecock Canal was closed , so the current would be a lazy one . Still , the body , facedown , immediately started to drift away from the bank . Fully dressed , per his orders . An air pocket was probably caught inside the nylon jacket , enough to give it buoyancy , or close to it . He had thought he might have to give the body a shove , and there was a broom handle in the back of the van for that reason . But he could see he would n't need to do that . The body was twenty feet from shore and still moving by the time he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the rear doors , then looked at the bay for a moment longer . He watched till he could n't distinguish the body from the surface chop that was stirred up by a steady wind that all but cut his exposed skin . He closed the doors , walked around to the front , and got in . Heat was coming finally from the vents , but he did n't want it , nor did he need it . He felt good just as he was and switched the heater off . It was to him a sign of his greatness , his strength . Then he pulled the column shifter down , made a U-turn , and drove back as slowly as he had come . He watched the houses as he went past them again , watching windows for a glimpse of a woman who might think as he thought , know what he knew . Maybe a blonde , maybe with a quaver in her voice and sad eyes and the willingness to do what needed to be done . He thought then of driving past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that was in a town farther east from here , on Peconic Bay , and anyway , there was a phone call to make and money to collect . He left Hampton Bays and started north through the darkness of the pine barrens , heading back to Riverhead . For the longest time his van was the only vehicle on the road . In Southampton , thirst woke Tommy Miller . He got out of bed , the floorboards cold beneath his bare feet , and walked lightly toward his bathroom . The windows were frosted , the small room lit tonight with a ghostly blue wash . He found that he was out of the little paper cups he used when he brushed his teeth , so he drank from the tap , filling the palm of his hand and bringing it to his mouth . Then he dried his hand on a towel and went back to his bed and to the woman he barely knew lying still and quiet beneath his blankets . It occurred to him , though , as he eased in beside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been even before he got up for some water . Her breathing was n't low and regular , and he knew enough about a sleeping woman to know that what he was hearing was n't the sound of someone comfortably at rest . By the clock on the nearby table he saw that it was just past midnight . They had fallen into bed together around ten , after too many drinks at Barrister 's and a quick ride to his house on Moses Lane , and made love as best they could , then lay side by side in awkward silence for a while . He must have dozed off soon after because the next thing he knew he was awake and in desperate need of some water . He moved carefully as he settled back into his bed , saying nothing to her . If he was wrong about the meaning of her breathing pattern and she was in fact asleep , he did n't want to disturb her . He was awake now , though -- the beer he 'd drunk had worn off in his nap . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark hour . He wondered if she had enjoyed herself , if he had acted properly . He was n't very experienced with this kind of encounter . He had n't been with a woman in a while , well over a year . He 'd needed time , needed to put distance between himself and a relationship that had ended quite badly . Before that , before the previous relationship , his only experience with women had been violent encounters . It was this , his past , when finally it was revealed , that had ended that relationship a year ago . As he lay beside this woman , he wondered how he would tell her , if it ever came to that , if this was n't just a one-night thing . What words , if any , would keep her from hating him , from leaving him , too . He was inclined now , with these thoughts in his head , these concerns and questions , to remain silent beside her even if she was awake . He 'd spent a year in such silence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough yet to veer him from this habit . His house was old and drafty , his bedroom cold . He had lived there with his mother and father before they died , lived there for all of his twenty-two years . The only source of heat in the whole place was a large square grate in the floor of the living room downstairs , the only access to the rooms above the narrow stairwell at the far end of the hallway . Miller had left his bedroom door half-open , but very little warmth had found its way up to them . Outside was a solemn winter night . He could sense the killing cold beyond his windows even from his bed . He and Abby had talked about the cold as they drank at Barrister 's . It was all anyone talked about . They had raced through it to his car when they left , laughing , just a bit tipsy . She had teased him about his cold feet when they first got into his bed . Her hands had felt almost like those of a dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up fast enough , for the most part anyway , and had remained warm for as long as they both stayed under the protection of his heavy blankets . He heard her sniffle now , once , and then again , and knew for certain that she was awake . He waited awhile , but the silence , broken only by their shallow breathing , rang . Eventually he said the only thing that he could think to say , a rehearsal for the day he , or someone else , would tell her his secret . Southampton was a small town , and notorious pasts were n't quickly forgotten . " Sorry , " he said . " What for ? " She spoke in a whisper . " I woke you . " " No . " Her voice , soft , deep for someone so young , was anything but groggy . He wondered how long it was he had slept beside her as she stared up at his ceiling . An hour ? More ? Their lovemaking had hardly been epic . They were little more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stake , he had been nervous . " You okay ? " She answered with a quick nod . Then , after a moment of more silence , " Is there a TV or something on downstairs ? I hear something . " He tuned into it then . On a bureau he kept in the hallway , just outside his half-open door , was a police scanner . It had belonged to his father . Miller kept it turned on with the volume set close to zero . The voices , unless you really listened , were little more than murmurs . He had adapted the ability to tune out the low voices and the occasional squawking , only listening closely when something important came through . Somehow he knew the difference ; it was something in the tone of the dispatcher 's voice that told him when to listen . It was a skill he had spent a lifetime developing , one that had also belonged to his father . But while this noise was little more to Miller than the sound of street traffic to a city person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore . Miller told her what it was and that he 'd turn it off . " You 'll only bring more cold back to bed if you get out again , " she said . " It 's okay for now . " " Are you sure ? " " Yeah . Maybe you can talk to me for a while . " " What about ? " " I do n't know . You can tell me why you have a police scanner . Why do you leave it on ? " " For work . " " You run a magazine store , " she said . It was how they met . His small shop , magazines and prepackaged bags of gourmet coffee , was next door to the gourmet deli where she worked . They had been on friendly terms since she started working there three months before , but in that time had n't exchanged anything more than small talk and pleasantries . She had mentioned in passing that she was about to turn twenty-one , and somehow he got the nerve to suggest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It all happened so quickly , really . He had always assumed , up till the point tonight when she told him otherwise , that she had a boyfriend . Attractive women were rarely single . He did n't ask her why she happened to be unattached , and she did n't offer . He was careful not to ask questions about a person 's past . They often led to questions about his own . But she was n't asking about his past now , just his present . Why did he listen to a scanner ? The question was unsafe territory for a number of reasons , the chief among them being that , whether she knew it or not , it was connected to his past , and could lead them places he did n't yet want to go . " Sometimes I do some work for a guy , " he answered . She was looking at him now . His eyes were fixed on the ceiling above . " What guy ? " " It 's nothing major . " " Tell me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She smiled , glad that they were at least talking . She was n't used to men staying around after sex . Being there in that strange bed , awake while he had slept , she had started to give in to feelings of loneliness . But now that was gone . " You brought it up , " she said , teasing him . " I 'm just not supposed to talk about it . It 's nothing to worry about . " " I was n't worried . " " I 'm not a criminal or anything . " " I did n't think you were . " She wanted to keep the conversation going . " So you live here all alone ? " " Yeah . " " You own it ? " " My parents left it to me . " " Oh . Lots of space for just you . " He nodded . His attention had drifted . She sensed it . " What ? " she said . " Wait a second . " At first she thought maybe he had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was straining to listen to something . " What is it ? " Her voice was a whisper still , but there was an edge of urgency in it now . " Did you hear that ? " " What ? " " On the scanner . " " No . " They both listened now . Neither moved or even breathed . His head was lifted off the pillow , and he was looking in the direction of the door . Then came a soft squawk , followed by a burst of murmured words . She could barely make them out . " What ? " she asked . " He said something about a body . " " What ? " " Hang on . " They listened together . After a moment there was another soft squawk , followed by more chatter she could n't understand . " It 's a patrol car calling in , " he told her . " What 's he saying ? " " They found another body . " " Another ? " Miller nodded . He was sitting up now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both naked under his blankets . " You mean another one of those boys ? " she said . One morning eight weeks ago a fisherman had found a body adrift in Mecox Bay . A month after that another body was found in Peconic Bay , this time by an old man as he took his early morning swim . Both victims were young men , the older of the two only twenty . The coroner had , in both cases , listed drowning as the cause of death , and the police had first considered these deaths suicides , finally ruling them as accidents . Miller , among others , was n't so convinced of that . Abby knew of the dead young men -- boys , really . Both deaths had made the local papers , and for days after each body was discovered , no one in town seemed to want to talk about anything else . Everyone who came into the deli had a theory , to believe that something other than what the cops were saying was actually going on . One of her regular customers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a youth and smelled always of garlic , was convinced that this was the work of , as he put it , " dark forces . " Such talk made her uneasy . Though she had a roommate , she was often alone at night , and the idea of something sinister roaming the quiet streets of her town disturbed her deeply , kept her from sleeping , and made her wish for someone , anyone , to be in bed beside her . Miller was sitting on the edge of the mattress now . He was a big guy , had once played football , had once been bound for the University of Michigan on an athletic scholarship . But his knee went , or , rather , was taken from him , and that all changed . Abby sat up , the blanket falling away , exposing her breasts to the cold air . She could barely see Miller in the outside light filtered deep blue by the frosted windows . But she could sense that he was listening now even more intently than before . She waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then a final squawk and murmur of words . She heard some of them this time . Shinnecock Bay . Reservation . The instant the transmission ended , Miller was standing , searching for his clothes . " Where are you going ? " she said . " I have to check something out . " He found his jeans , then his shirt , and finally his boots . He dressed beside the bed , quickly . She felt threatened by his abruptness but fought hard not to let this trigger her old insecurities . " How long will you be ? " " I do n't know . I 'm sorry . You can wait here , though . I mean , I 'll be back eventually . " " Do you want me to wait here ? " " Yeah . I 'll have my cell phone . You can call me if there 's a problem . " " Where are you going ? " " I just need to check this out . " " Why ? " " I wo n't be long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to be any longer than that , I 'll call . " She nodded despite her uncertainty about this . Her car was back in town , parked in the lot behind the deli , a mile or so away . Walking distance in the summer but not in this weather , not with her uneasiness about things that lurked , both imagined and real . " You can watch TV if you want . And I have food downstairs . I 'm sorry about this . " The words echoed in his head . He would be saying this again soon , if things got that far . " It 's okay , " she said . " Just hurry back . " He was dressed now , tucking in his shirt , tightening his belt . His army field jacket and down vest he wore beneath were downstairs , by her coat . They had begun in his kitchen , kissing as they had walked through the door . It seemed at the time that throwing themselves at each other before they sobered up was the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as he had . For both of them it was nothing short of a leap into darkness . He left her in his bed , in the cold room , and , as best as his bad knee would allow him , hurried down the stairs . He grabbed his vest and coat and gloves . He was zippering up the field jacket as he hurried out the back door , his muscles flexing against the harsh , cold air . He paused to make sure the door was locked , then rushed to his pickup . He sat behind the wheel a moment , allowing the engine a few seconds to warm up , then shifted into gear and pulled out of his driveway . At the end of Moses Lane he turned right , heading west on Hill Street . He wondered as he drove down the empty two-lane road if he had been maybe a little too eager to get out of there . Had he jumped at the chance to get away ? He needed to do this , to find out what he could . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation . The more things they talked about , the more small talk they used up , the sooner there would be nothing left for him to say but to tell her the things he had once done . His breath was a white mist that burst from his nostrils and mouth . Steady , long bursts . He could smell her on him , taste her still . He thought about her , the warmth of her beside him . In the distance were police sirens . He was moving toward them . Miller 's hope was to arrive before the cops were able to get organized . Moses Lane was n't more than a few minutes ' drive from the reservation , even at the posted speed limit , so there was a good chance of making it before the scene could be secured . Miller made the sharp left-hand turn from Hill Street onto Little Beach Road not much more than a minute after leaving his house , but once he did , he was forced to ease back on the accelerator . The roads that ran through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well tended or even marked . His pickup , though one of the smaller trucks of its line , was n't designed for high speeds , certainly not high speeds through this kind of environment . So he forced himself to drive more cautiously despite the excitement building in his gut , mounting like a storm inside him . He needed to keep his emotions in check , to govern himself better ; he 'd been told that several times before by the man from whom he wanted to get more work . Miller wanted to show that he could learn , that he could change , that in fact he had changed . The last thing he needed was to roll his truck over on a turn and not even reach the scene . That would hardly be impressive , he thought , hardly serve to help make his case for being worthy of full-time employment by the only PI in town . Miller made a second left turn onto Church Street and was approaching Cemetery Road when he caught sight of something up ahead . Bright lights flickering in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church Street even though he knew by these lights that he was already too late . It was only a few seconds later that the first patrol car came into view . Then another , and then a third . They were parked together in a cluster , their red and blue bubble lights blinking , each one out of sync with the other and illuminating with a kind of unrelenting chaos the tops of the bare trees that lined this back road . Two of the cars were parked nose to nose across Cemetery Road , blocking it to traffic . The third car was directly beyond these two , facing toward the bay , its headlights lighting the way down the empty road . A uniformed cop with a flashlight standing at the corner of Cemetery and Church waved Miller off , making it clear that he wanted Miller to turn left onto Cemetery and not right as Miller had indicated with his turn signal . But Miller did n't make the left , just stopped at the end of Church and sat there , waiting . The cop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way he moved . Miller did n't know the man . Half of the force now was made up of recruits who had been hired after Miller 's father had been killed five years earlier . Those who remained on the force , who had once been blindly loyal to Miller 's father , were too worried about their jobs these days to ever be of much help to Miller those few times when he could have used it . The police chief the town had brought in to replace Miller 's father was as against corruption as a man could get , easily as against it as Miller 's father had been for it , a part of it , at the head of it for most of his career . This cop was wearing a fur-lined leather jacket and a cap with earflaps . It was n't anywhere close to being enough against this cold . But nothing short of a parka and full-face mask would have been enough tonight . As the cop approached , Miller rolled down his window and felt a blast of cold air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with the force of a crowd . " Road 's closed , " the cop said . He spoke quickly . It was n't a conversation opener . It was the conversation , as far as he was concerned . But not as Miller was concerned . " What 's going on ? " he said . " Do you live down this road ? " " No . " " Then I 'm going to need you to turn around . " " What happened ? " " You 're going to need to turn around and leave . " " Was there an accident or something ? " " Please turn your vehicle around . This is a crime scene , closed to the public . " The cop backed away , giving Miller room to turn . He kept his eyes focused on Miller . Miller nodded and rolled the window up , then made a U-turn , heading east along Cemetery . The next street over was Old Point Road . He turned onto it and pulled over again . Through the woods that separated these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just their light show in the trees a block over . Of course this meant they could n't see him , either . He shut off his motor and killed his headlights and stepped out into the cold . It grabbed at him right away , hard . The wind was coming from the south . He looked into it , his eyes quickly drying . He tilted his head down , tucking his chin against his chest , and walked into the wind , cutting through the small woods that stood between him and the bay . He always carried a small penlight in the pocket of his jacket . He used it now to find his way . The larger flashlight he kept under the front seat of his truck would have certainly made the going easier , but it also would have attracted attention , which of course he did n't want . After a minute of trudging through the woods , he lifted his head and could see the bay . He was n't far from it now , just a few yards . The dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else to see . To his right he could hear cops , their voices but not what was being said . By the way they spoke he could tell that they were talking into their radios , reporting in . He heard the same squawking sounds he had heard back in the warmth of his bedroom , the same cross-chatter . The woods gave way and he was in the open finally , standing on the edge of the bay . The beach was narrow , only a few feet wide . The sand was filled with rocks and bits of broken shells that crunched beneath his boots . He looked to his right and saw two cops , or the shape of two cops , anyway , standing together . They were looking out over the water , shining their flashlights into it . Miller tried to follow their line of vision but could n't make out anything but chop . The water was black , except for where it was touched by the flashlights , and then it looked like tarnished silver . So far the cops had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . But he needed to know what they knew . He needed to know something , anything . He needed specific information to report . And he was n't going to get it standing where he was . He turned off his penlight and started toward the cops . He did n't want to have come out in the cold for nothing . Miller closed about half the distance between where he had exited the woods and where the cops stood . But he still could n't see what they were looking at . Another cop joined them , and then another still . After about a dozen steps along the sand , Miller stopped . The last cop to arrive had what looked to be a handheld floodlight . He shook it several times , then whacked it with the heel of his palm , once , then again . The other cops gathered around him , and it was then that the light finally came on , casting a clear circle of bright white at their feet . The other cops stepped back , opening a clear run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly down the beach , the wide beam cast finally out over the bay . Miller could see it then , see what it was they were all looking at . A body was floating facedown . It was about fifty feet from the shore , maybe less . The tide was low , and the body was n't moving . Miller figured that its feet must have dragged along the bottom as it drifted into shallow water . He imagined the toes acting as anchors . The body probably would n't be coming closer , or going out any farther , for that matter , not till the tide shifted and the water got higher . Of course who it was floating in the freezing-cold bay Miller did n't know . Nor did he know if it was a male or a female , and that mattered , that much he would need to report . He wanted to show himself to be helpful , someone not to overlook , and the news that someone had been found floating in the bay was n't going to do that . Anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that the police would sit on for as long as they could , but not out of courtesy to the victim 's loved ones . There was a bigger agenda in play here . Miller waited , watching . He was shivering , his teeth starting to chatter , but he was n't going to leave now . He was close enough finally to hear not only voices but words . He heard one cop wonder if they should call the fire department to help retrieve the body . Another asked if the town had a diver on call , someone with a dry suit who could just wade out . Then a third cop pointed out that half the kids enrolled at the college were marine biology majors . They 'd have wet suits , and the college was less than a mile away . Another cop , the one who had brought the floodlight , said that Roffman , the chief of police , was on his way , and that policy was to contact the coast guard , which had already been done . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fifteen minutes . A short while went by and nothing much else happened . The cops waited , stomping their feet against the cold , their hands in the pockets of their coats , their shoulders held up as far as was possible . No one said much of anything , and all the radios were now silent . Miller wondered if the cops had been able to determine from where they were standing if the dead body was that of a man or a woman . Young or old ? Maybe the clothes , maybe the hair would give it away , something . After a moment Miller decided that it was probable that at least one of those cops knew him , had in the past worked for his father . Certainly if Miller walked up to them and was recognized , he would be taken away , but not without first learning more , if he was lucky . He decided that it was worth the shot , easily a better thing to do than just standing around in the freezing cold , too far away to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miller started walking toward them . They were facing the water , standing in a cluster , but it did n't take long for one of them to turn his head . Maybe he had heard Miller , or caught sight of him from the corner of his eye , or maybe just sensed him out there in the dark , sensed his motion . For whatever reason , the cop turned suddenly . " Hold it , " he said . There was anger in his voice . Not authority but anger . Miller knew then , coming out of the dark as he was , that he had startled the cop , caught him off guard . The man 's anger was a reaction to the fear that had cut through him like a shot . Miller had seen that a hundred times in his life , seen cops covering up their emotions in that exact way . The other cops turned too . Several flashlights cut into Miller 's eyes at once . Miller just stood there with his hands held out from his side . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . He made sure the tone of his voice was even and calm . He wanted to appear as innocent as possible . It was necessary despite the fact that he was innocent , more or less . Just a man out for a stroll , nothing to worry about . What 's all the fuss ? No , I love this cold , are you kidding ? But the cops were n't swayed by his act . Miller had snuck up on them , had strayed into a crime scene , and not just any crime scene . They acted quickly , three of them moving toward Miller . Without hesitating they led him away from the water 's edge . There was n't any woods here to climb through , just an open parking lot , empty except for patrol cars . Miller turned his head to look over his shoulder as they escorted him away , trying to see what he could , but there was no light on the body now . He could barely see the shape of it in the water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the nearest patrol car . None of these men was someone Miller knew all that well , certainly not well enough to expect anything close to favorable treatment . None of these men had worked for his father , had come to the Miller home for meals , had been there to congratulate Miller when he won his scholarship to Michigan . At the patrol car Miller was questioned . He understood that the cops ' first reaction would be to assume that Miller had something to do with the body floating in the bay . Maybe he was returning to the scene of the crime , feigning innocence , just to mock the police . Their need for a break in this case would lead them to such a wild hope . The cop who asked the most questions was in his thirties , not that much older than Miller himself . His name was Spadaro , and he had been hired three or four years ago . It was hard for Miller to keep track , though he tried to , tried to keep all the players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to him , worth the effort required . Spadaro pressed Miller to explain what he was doing out here , at this time of the night , in this weather . Did Miller live around here ? Miller calmly replied that he took this walk every night . He did n't live far , and he liked this beach , liked that it was secluded . The Shinnecock did n't seem to mind that Miller came here . As for the cold , he did n't much mind it , and anyway there was n't much he could do about it , was there ? He needed his walks , they cleared his head . He thought about mentioning something about doctor 's orders but stopped himself . Keep it simple , do n't say too much . Of course everything Miller said was a lie . He never took walks on this beach , or any beach , for that matter . Walking on sand was particularly hard on his bad knee . And he hated the cold , despised winter . He spent his evenings thinking of summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows and swelling curtains , crickets chirping , the sound of cars on Hill Street . He craved all that . But Miller was n't really worried about being found out . He was n't worried that any of the early suspicions the cops had about him would lead to anything serious . He had spent all day working at his tiny shop on Main Street . Regulars had come and gone at the rate of five or six each hour , had seen him , spoken to him , handed him their money . After work he had gone for drinks at Barrister 's , and plenty of people had seen him there , seen him leave with Abby . Then of course there was Abby to back up what he had done with his time after that , and the cop watching the perimeter who had seen Miller drive up just moments before . No , he was n't worried about this going too far . He was covered . And , besides all that , he was the son of a cop , had grown up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than he could read anyone . He had already seen in Spadaro 's body language the exact instant when hope of a lucky break fled from the man . Soon enough Spadaro ran out of questions . Or maybe it had become clear to him that Miller was n't going to run out of answers . He left Miller at the car , under the watch of another cop , and went to confer with his colleagues standing near the water 's edge . Miller waited , listening to the conversations around him , to the squawk of the radio . He listened for anything that would tell him more than what he had seen . But he heard nothing . His face was numb now , and he knew that the inside of the car by which he was standing would be warm , that relief from this brutal cold was so close . But he tried not to think too much about that . He imagined instead the nights he craved , those bouts of humidity that come and stay around for a few days in August , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean breezes . He wondered if Abby would be around next summer , if she would still be in his life , coming to see him after work and lying beside him , her skin silky and cool . He imagined beads of sweat collected on the bridge of her small nose , and how her hair , after a late night shower she had taken to cool off , would smell spread across his clean pillowcase . Another car pulled into the lot then , its headlights swinging toward Miller . He turned his head so he could not be recognized . When the light passed , he looked and saw that this car was an unmarked sedan , the same make and year as the patrol cars . Roffman , the new chief of police , was arriving on the scene . Miller watched as the car came to a stop and Roffman climbed out from the passenger seat . A man of average build , Roffman was in his midforties . At first glance , there was nothing very distinctive about him , nothing threatening or , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summed Roffman up in one word : administrator . But Miller knew better , knew the man to be more than he appeared to be . Roffman was a politician first , good and getting better every year , and a cop second . Compassionate human being was somewhere much farther down that list . Another cop climbed out of the sedan . A woman , from behind the wheel . Miller knew her . Her name was Barton , and she had been the last cop hired by Miller 's father , back when the man was under investigation by the FBI and trying to give his department at least the appearance of being something less than corrupt . But her appearance here now was too little , too late . Miller 's chances of learning anything more had disappeared the moment Roffman arrived . Spadaro hurried up from the beach to meet Roffman . He must have seen the headlights . At first it looked like Spadaro was going to be successful in leading the chief past Miller , which was clearly his intention . It would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotted him just as he reached the end of the parking lot . He stopped short , fifteen feet from Miller , regarding him the way he might regard a stray dog that had wandered into his yard with the intention of digging a hole . " Christ . What is he doing here ? " Roffman said . Spadaro answered that Miller had walked into the crime scene from somewhere down the beach -- or at least Spadaro started to say that . Roffman cut him off mid-sentence . " Get him out of here . If he shows his face again , arrest him . " " Yes , sir . " " This is n't amateur night . " This was n't said to Spadaro but to Miller . Roffman waited a moment more , staring at Miller , then finally turned , sharply , and continued toward the shore . To say anything else would have been to give Miller more attention than he deserved , the exact kind of attention the kid desired . He was just a wannabe , a busybody , and Roffman was n't worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him if he got out of hand . His past could revisit him . All it would take was an accusation , or the threat of one . The kid would crumble , run . But that fuck the kid worked for sometimes , he was a different story . He was a problem , something to worry about , especially now that a family had hired him . If it came to it , Roffman would send him a message by locking up his little scout , kill two birds with one stone . If it came to it , which it looked now like it had . Roffman reached the beach and started down it . Barton was following behind , but Spadaro stopped her . " Take Miller to his car and make sure he leaves the area , " he said . " If he does n't go or tries to come back , cuff him and take him in . Understand ? " Spadaro hurried after Roffman then . He did n't look back at Miller . Together , the two men headed down the beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to face them . The floodlight came on again , aimed at the sand , a circle of light as white as a summer moon . Barton led Miller to the unmarked sedan . He did n't make her say anything to him . He 'd pushed his luck as far as it would go . They reached the car and got in , Miller in the back seat , like a criminal . But he did n't care . The warmth . Barton sat behind the wheel . Miller told her where his truck was , and she started toward it , passing a few hundred feet later the cop 's standing point on Cemetery Road . She made the turn onto Old Point Road and parked at the curb , bumper-to-bumper with Miller 's pickup . She yanked the column shifter up and turned her head to look at Miller through the cage that separated the back seat from the front . She spoke over her shoulder to him . " You working ? " she said . " Or has this just become a habit of yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Barton smiled . She was twenty-seven , maybe twenty-eight , Miller was n't sure . She certainly was n't over thirty . She was tall , fair-skinned , slight even in her cold-weather jacket . Miller could n't recall ever seeing her outside the company of Roffman . She was his driver whenever he left Village Hall on business , and at the end of the day , when it was time to go home . During the day , while in the office , she was his assistant , rarely pulling any other duty . There were rumors about the exact nature of their relationship , but Miller wrote most of those off as nothing more than the griping that usually occurs whenever a woman is brought into what has for too long been a boys ' club . Still , Barton was attractive , had a natural beauty , did n't wear a lot of makeup , did n't try to call attention to herself , not that she needed to . Her hair was brown and straight , done up in a bun when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in civilian clothes . If there was anything more to Barton 's relationship with the chief , Miller knew he could n't really blame the man , though maybe she had some explaining to do . Barton had a smile that was quick and warm , even when she was using it to let you know that she knew full well that you were lying , like now . Few men could resist a killer smile . " You 're out here for that friend of yours , are n't you ? " Barton said . Miller did n't answer . Instead , he asked , " Is it a man or a woman out there floating in the bay ? " It was what he had come out into the cold to learn . " Tommy , " she half-scolded . She had always treated Miller in a sisterly kind of way . She had stood beside him at his father 's funeral five years ago . She 'd only been on the force for a few months then but had already become like family . Two years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother was buried . In the years that followed there really had n't been a day when Miller did n't think of her . And there had n't been a week when she did n't call to check up on him . " Just tell me , Kay . " " Why do you care ? " " It 's a man , is n't it ? " " You should go home . I mean it . " " I just need to know . " " So you can impress your friend ? " Miller nodded . " Then he is n't really your friend , is he ? " " You should n't believe everything you 've heard about him . He 's not what a lot of people think . " Barton waited a moment , watching him . " So what is it with you two anyway ? I mean , the real story . " Miller ignored the question . " It 's a young guy back there . Is n't it ? " She nodded . " Yeah , that 's what they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They called the chief on the phone and told him . They did n't want it going out over the radio . " " No , I meant how do they know . The body is a pretty good distance from the shore . Facedown , from what I can tell . " " There was a phone tip . An anonymous woman . She said there was the body of a young man floating in Shinnecock Bay . Units went looking and spotted it . " " That 's weird . I mean , how did she know it was a young man if it 's offshore ? " " That 's what I was wondering , too . " " Were there phone tips before ? For the other two ? " Barton shook her head , but he knew she was refusing his question , not answering it . " That 's all I can do for you , Tommy . Anyway , you 're going to want to stay out of this . Roffman is under a lot of pressure . The mayor , too . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who are afraid tourists will think twice about coming out here if they 're worried about ending up facedown in a bay . Do yourself a favor , okay ? Stay out of this . " Miller reached for the door handle . He needed to call this in , needed to do that now . " Thanks for the tip . And for the advice . " He yanked at the handle but the door was locked . There was no way to unlock it from the back seat . He looked at Barton through the metal screen . She was still looking over her shoulder at him . He looked at the side of her face . " I mean it , Tom . Stay clear of this . Tell your friend , too . This is serious business . " " We 've always thought so . Let me out now , Kay . " " Do n't like being locked up ? " " Not really . " She nodded and pressed a button in the console in her door . The back door unlocked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you , Kay . " Miller swung the door open and got out , hurrying to his truck . He climbed behind the wheel and started the engine for the heat . Barton made a U-turn , then stopped , the sedan standing alongside Miller 's truck . Miller waved to her . She nodded , then drove off . He dug his cell phone from the pocket of his field jacket and punched in a number , then waited . It was late , but there was nothing he could do about that . Three rings , and then a female voice , low and breathy , the accent French . It was hard for him to tell if he had awakened her ; she always sounded a little dreamy , a little far away . " Hello . " " It 's Miller . Is he there ? " The female voice said , " One moment , " then disappeared . A few seconds later Miller was listening to a male voice . " Yeah . " " They found another body , " Miller said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as before , pretty much . Except this one did n't just wash up . They found it because some woman called in an anonymous tip . " There was a pause , then : " You 're certain about this ? " " Yeah . What do you want me to do from here ? " " Nothing . " " I can help . " " Do n't need it . " " I know the family has hired you to find their kid . I 'm trying to be a good citizen here . I did n't have to tell you any of this . " " Call Reggie tomorrow . He 'll give you the usual hundred bucks . " " I do n't want snitch money . I want to help you guys . " " If you want to help , do what you can to lose my number . Understand ? " The line went dead . Miller closed his cell phone and looked out his window . Through the bare trees he could see the bay , a dark void in the expanse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just so much sky over so much water . Beyond the bay was a narrow strip of land . Dune Road . It separated the bay from the Atlantic . Fantastic homes were found there , and secluded beaches . Why not toss the body into the sea ? Miller thought . At the right time , it would be carried far away , wash up somewhere else , if at all . The two bodies before this one were also found in bays . Why ? Miller stared at the string of greenish lights that ran the length of Dune Road . Streetlights , but from where he sat , a long bracelet of pale emeralds spread out unevenly against a soulless black . A thing of beauty , thin , frail , not much really against so much dark . The only sign of life , aside from the cops back at the shore 's edge , and Miller 's own breathing . Now he thought of the girl waiting for him in his bed . Her warmth , her smells , her breath . There was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done tonight . So he started back toward home , vents blowing heat against his legs , as he drove rehearsing in his head what he would say and what he would not say . A late moon was rising in the northeast , in the sky over town , cresting the long line of trees . It added very little light to the night . Continues ... by Judson , Daniel
