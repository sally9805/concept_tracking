1 <p> My eyes must be playing tricks on me . Nina Lawson glanced at the digital clock in the lower corner of her Hewlett-Packard laptop . It was two forty-five in the morning . Yes , her eyes had to be playing tricks on her . She was dog tired after staying up studying for her latest real estate exam , so she knew she should n't put much stock in the email that was blaring at her . She 'd only checked it because she came across it as she was looking for an email from one of her clients . She realized she had n't checked her numbers from Saturday 's drawing , so she decided to quickly look at the update email from the Lottery Commission . <p> She never expected this . <p> " ' The winning lotto numbers for Saturday 's Texas Lotto drawing are **51;571;TOOLONG , ' " she mumbled , reading the email again . <p> Nina 's eyes made their way back down to the little pink ticket clutched tightly in her right hand . 4-7-14-17-21-25 . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still the same . <p> Slowly , any semblance of weariness began to fade away . <p> " Ohmigod , ohmigod , ohmigod . " Nina 's whispers gradually turned into an all-out shout . <p> " I won ! I won ! Yes ! " Nina began screaming as she jumped up from her leather chair , sending it toppling to the floor . She did n't realize how loud she was being until she looked up to see her fiancT , Rick Henderson , standing in the doorway to her office . <p> " What in the world is wrong with you ? " he groggily asked . " You know I have to get up and go to work in the morning . Why are you still up ? And why are you in here screaming like you 're crazy ? " <p> Nina shook out both her hands , trying to calm herself down . Rick was standing there shirtless , his caramel-colored skin and rippled abs reminding her why he was one of the most soughtafter personal trainers in Houston . They 'd met two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into shape . He 'd flirted with Nina , telling her how pretty she was and how much she looked like Gabrielle Union . Even so , she did n't give him the time of day because she was married at the time . Then , two months after her divorce , she 'd bumped into him at the gym where he worked . They 'd gone to lunch , and the next thing Nina knew , he was spending every night at her house . <p> Rick was sweet , caring , and the finest man she 'd ever seen . But more than that , he was good to her . After her ex-husband , Todd , betrayed her , Nina thought she 'd never be in love again , but Rick had quickly changed that . Too quickly , her friends said . He 'd moved in with her about six weeks after their first date to help her with her bills , which she 'd been struggling to pay since Todd left . Despite her apprehension about getting involved with someone so soon after her marriage ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only were they living together but they were engaged to be married . <p> " Baby , you 're not going to believe this , " Nina said , bringing her excitement level down a notch . <p> " Do you know what time it is ? " he repeated . " I have a client at five o'clock , Mrs. Brighton . And you know she comes all hyped up and ready to work . " <p> Nina smiled widely . " Well , you need to call Mrs. Brighton and tell her you are n't coming to work out with her tomorrow . Tell her you wo n't ever be working out with her again . " <p> Rick rubbed his closely shaven head . " Nina , what are you talking about ? " <p> She had to use everything in her power to contain her excitement . She inhaled deeply , then sauntered over to him , lightly waving the pink ticket in front of him . " This is what I 'm talking about . This little piece of paper is about to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked , squinting . <p> " Here . " She excitedly handed him the ticket . " Take a look at this . " <p> He took it but continued to frown as she raced back over to the computer . <p> " Look , girl , I do n't have time to be playing . I need to get some sleep . " <p> " Just gim me a minute . " Nina began reading the computer screen again . " ' The winning numbers for Saturday 's Texas Lotto drawing are **52;624;TOOLONG . ' " She stood up triumphantly and pointed at the ticket . " What do the numbers on that ticket say ? " <p> " Nina ... " <p> " What do the numbers say ? " she repeated . <p> He huffed in frustration , then read the ticket . " **40;678;TOOLONG ... " His eyes grew wide as he looked up at Nina . " Oh , my God . I ... is this for real ? " <p> Nina was grinning like a kid at a chocolate factory as the excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gets ! " She could no longer contain herself . She raced over and threw her arms around his neck . " We 're rich , baby . Rich , rich , rich ! " <p> Granted , they were n't married , but he had popped the question out of the blue two months ago . Rick was trying to open his own gym , and he wanted to be financially secure before they actually set a wedding date . He had bought her a small band , with promises to upgrade to a platinum and diamond one as soon as he got his money right . Still , Nina had no doubt that she was sharing her winnings with her man . Shoot , if anything , they were definitely ready to marry now . <p> Rick pulled away from Nina , taking a look at the ticket again . Shock was still blasted across his face . " H-how much ? " <p> She kissed him hard . " Sixteen million , " she said , pulling back . " I mean , I did the cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that actually equates to , but I 'm sure it 's somewhere in the millions , even after taxes . " <p> Rick kept staring at the ticket like he could n't believe it . " But how , I mean ... is this for real ? " <p> She nodded . " I would n't play around with something like this , especially at three o'clock in the morning . " <p> " Since when did you start playing the lottery ? " <p> Nina shrugged . " I 'm not a regular player . I just play every now and then . I was in the gas station Saturday and found a five-dollar bill folded up in my pocket , so I just bought five tickets . I never in a million years thought I 'd win . " <p> For once Rick was speechless . He was a hustler , so he was always talking a good game . Nina always told him that his gift of gab was so great , he should 've been in sales . <p> Nina took Rick 's hand and led him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the living room of their small three-bedroom home , which she 'd moved into after her divorce . <p> " Do you know what this means ? " she said , easing him down onto the sofa . <p> " It means you 're rich ? " he said slowly , like everything was still registering . <p> " It means we 're rich , baby . I can pay off those student loans , get out of debt , open my real estate business , and you  --  you can now finally open that gym you 've wanted to open . " <p> Rick had been scrimping and saving for years to fulfill his dream of opening an upscale gym that catered to young professionals . He 'd managed to save a nice chunk of change , but three months ago , his only brother was killed , and Rick had to use the money to bury his brother . So he was essentially starting all over . <p> A smile finally crossed Rick 's face as his eyes began to twinkle . " We 're rich ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're rich . " <p> He jumped up and swung her around in circles as they both let out piercing screams . Nina could n't remember a time she 'd been happier . She knew from that moment forward , their lives would never be the same . <p> Copyright 2009 by ReShonda Tate Billingsley <br> Continues ...
