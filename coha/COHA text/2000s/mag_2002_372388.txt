In Santa Monica , a beach town known for its movie stars , the sun shines almost every day , palm trees sway on the boulevards  --  and the groundwater is poisoned . All over town , ugly drilling rigs mounted on trucks are boring 300-foot holes to trace the plumes of a pollutant that has leaked from the underground tanks of gasoline stations . The culprit : methyl tertiary butyl ether ( MTBE ) , an additive that makes gasoline burn cleaner but one the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has classified as a potential carcinogen . Half of Santa Monica 's water supply is undrinkable  --  MTBE makes water taste like turpentine  --  and the city ( pop . 85,000 ) faces a $300 million cleanup that could take as long as 30 years . As lawsuits against 18 oil companies drag on , California has ordered a phaseout of the chemical , and a dozen other states have followed suit . <P> If this were an ordinary tale of one more controversial pollutant , it could be resolved in U.S. courts . But the MTBE conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for globalization and a key issue in President Bush 's effort to win new trade-negotiating powers from Congress next month . That 's because METHANEX , the Canadian company that makes a key ingredient of MTBE , is challenging California 's ban under the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement . The case has raised doubts about whether a state can protect its drinking water as it sees fit . Do such health regulations amount to a trade barrier ? <P> Methanex wants U.S. taxpayers to compensate it for $970 million in profits it would lose as a result of a California MTBE phaseout . CEO Pierre Choquette asserts , " We believe the ban of MTBE was politically motivated " to favor the U.S.-made gasoline additive ethanol " and has no scientific merit . " The company 's director of investor relations , Brad Boyd , says , " California should make sure its underground gas tanks do n't leak . That 's what would protect the public . " <P> The issue will be decided , under terms of international treaties , by a panel of arbitrators , chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meeting behind closed doors . A U.S. loss could be challenged in federal court  --  but only on narrow procedural grounds . Critics fear that a Methanex win would upend the principle that " the polluter pays . " Instead , the polluter would be paid . A California senate committee questioned whether hundreds of state and local laws  --  from fishing-fleet fees to truck-inspection rules to a preference for recycled paper  --  could be challenged by foreign investors . Says state senator Sheila Kuehl : " A secret tribunal is going to decide whether a private company can trump laws passed by a democratically elected government . "
