Never at a loss for unusual points of reference , Viktor &; Rolf ( celebrating their label 's 10th anniversary ) may have found their most powerful inspiration yet : actress Tilda Swinton . William Middleton reports // Photographed by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin Separate the signal from the noise , " instructs the clean , crisp voice of actress Tilda Swinton . The fall Viktor &; Rolf collection opens with Swinton standing in the center of the runway , looking like a vision from another world . Her short red hair is slicked back , her skin particularly pale , her features fierce and angular . She is wearing a loose-fitting , sharply tailored black pantsuit with a perfect white shirt and tie . The soundtrack begins with a pounding heartbeat and a voiceover written by the actress : " Cut the strings . Be yourself . Only you . Walk . " As the other models march out , all with slicked-back , reddish hair , the soundtrack builds . " Drown out suspicion , " her voice commands . " Germinate faith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , layering and volume : a jacket with eight collars arching up to frame the face , a black coat made of nine layers of jackets piled on top of one another . Yet the elegance is unmistakable : a simple black satin tuxedo , one flawless gray sheath in sheer chiffon . The show closes with Swinton standing in front of more than a dozen models made up just like her . " Separate the signal from the noise , " the soundtrack concludes over the pounding heartbeat . " There is only one of you . Only one . " The fall Viktor &; Rolf collection , staged in an industrial park on the outskirts of Paris and called One Woman Show , was among the most thrilling of the season . Both wearable and extravagant , it was a comment on individuality , originality and staying true to yourself . " We tried to distill 10 years of Viktor &; Rolf into one visual statement , " explains Rolf Snoeren , half of the design duo . " We wanted to show the key elements that we use-layering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic , purest way possible . " The show was also a declaration of the creative collaboration between Swinton and Viktor &; Rolf . The designers first met her in July 1999 after presenting their Russian Doll collection , when model Maggie Rizer twirled under towering layers of embroidered , jewel-encrusted gowns . " I remember just rocking with delight , " Swinton says . When she needed a dress for last year 's Golden Globes , she went to see the designers in Amsterdam . " From when we first met Tilda , she seemed to animate our clothes , " says Snoeren 's design partner Viktor Horsting . " Somehow , they were perfect for her and she made us look at them as if they were given a new dimension . " As Snoeren remembers , " She tried everything on , and suddenly the clothes came alive . " The actress says simply , " We could have dreamed each other up . " The Scottish actress , who has been called " the avant-garde 's Garbo , " is best known for her breakthrough , pansexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patient , puzzled studio exec in Adaptation and won critical acclaim as a determined mother in the updated film noir The Deep End . This year , she was in Cannes with Ewan McGregor for the premiere of their Scottish drama , Young Adam ; spent several months in Paris filming Norman Jewison 's The Statement , with Michael Caine ; and went to Oregon to shoot Thumbsucker , the first feature by acclaimed video director and graphic artist Mike Mills , also starring Vincent D'Onofrio and Keanu Reeves . Horsting and Snoeren have worked together since they were students at Holland 's prestigious Arnhem Academy of Art . They shot onto the international stage in 1993 when their graduate collection won first prize at a French fashion festival in Hyeres . Once they began showing in Paris , their approach to design was unapologetically conceptual . One show featured a soundtrack with their names repeated over and over , a send-up of the lure of designer-name recognition , while another had a model smash her white porcelain necklace and hat , symbolizing their desire to end the domination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many wondering whether they were performance artists or fashion designers , the issue was settled when they launched their ready-to-wear line for fall 2000 . Having barely sold a stitch of clothing at that point , they were suddenly selling their designs in 20 stores across America . They 've since managed to blend the practicality of ready-to-wear with the theatricality of haute couture , pulling off shows with dozens of tap dancers , a forceful all-black collection , as well as a triumphant all-white show in a medieval chapel in front of a silver pipe organ . Swinton , starting with the black chiffon gown with an oversize sash she wore to the 2002 Golden Globes , has certainly shown the world how to wear Viktor &; Rolf . Last year in Cannes , she walked the red carpet in a dramatic Yves Klein-blue velvet dress and matching coat . Another night , she donned an oversize white shirt adorned with ribbons and bows , and white organza pants . For the Adaptation premiere in Los Angeles , she turned heads in a black tuxedo and a vivid flower-burst top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biker kilt and mod jacket from the current collection . The partnership is happening at the perfect time for the pair . To celebrate their 10-year anniversary , Viktor &; Rolf will be the subject of a sprawling retrospective at the fashion museum at the Louvre , the Musee de la Mode et du Textile . Opening this month and running through January , the show will cover two floors . It will be one of only a handful of single-label exhibitions ever held at the museum ( including such legends as Christian Dior , Yves Saint Laurent and Issey Miyake ) . Focusing on the work as well as the ideas behind it , the exhibition is being curated by the designers . They are also now producing their debut fragrance with L'Oreal , the first time the cosmetics giant has partnered with a fashion house since Giorgio Armani in 1985 . The Viktor &; Rolf scent will be available internationally in early 2005 . " According to them , it was because we are storytellers , " Snoeren says of the decision by L'Oreal . " We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a fragrance is : You want people to share that dream with you . " Working on the L'Oreal project has given them another way to explain Swinton 's role in their creative process . " In the perfume world , there is always one bottle in a shop that is there to be tested , " Snoeren explains . " The technical term for that is a " glorifier , " which we thought was such a great word . Now we say that Tilda is our glorifier-she inspires . " So what is it that appeals to Swinton about their work ? " Their cut is , literally , genius , " she says . " Like Raphael 's drawings , you ca n't work out how it 's done . And their frame of reference is seemingly limitless . They have the movies of Hollywood costumers Adrian and Edith Head , early Yves Saint Laurent and glam-rock designer Freddie Burretti , all the while producing work so startlingly original that it never looks like anything other than them . " Her enthusiasm now runs in the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares with artist John Byrne and their five-year-old twins , Xavier and Honor , Swinton screens videos of the shows . After seeing what his mother calls the Long Live the Immaterial collection-where dramatic images were projected onto bright blue clothes through the use of bluescreen technology from film and television-Xavier announced that there are now two tiny , invisible mechanics watching over the cars in his toy garage . Their names ? Viktor and Rolf . And the collaboration between the designers and the actress looks set to continue . The trio have already exchanged thoughts about next season , with Swinton text-messaging ideas about pieces that she would like to have made for the collection . And they all regard the 10-year anniversary of Viktor &; Rolf as the time to draw the curtain on the first phase of their careers and move toward the future . As Horsting says of their next act : " You ai n't seen nothin " yet . " Sidebar " Tilda seemed to animate our clothes , " says Viktor Horsting .
