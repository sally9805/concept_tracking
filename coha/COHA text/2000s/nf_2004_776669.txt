THE BOOK OF NUMBERS // Brielle , New Jersey , September 1991 // Bill Nagle 's life changed the day a fisherman sat beside him in a ramshackle bar and told him about a mystery he had found lying at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean . Against his better judgment , that fisherman promised to tell Nagle how to find it . The men agreed to meet the next day on the rickety wooden pier that led to Nagle 's boat , the Seeker , a vessel Nagle had built to chase possibility . But when the appointed time came , the fisherman was not there . Nagle paced back and forth , careful not to plunge through the pier where its wooden planks had rotted away . He had lived much of his life on the Atlantic , and he knew when worlds were about to shift . Usually , that happened before a storm or when a man 's boat broke . Today , however , he knew it was going to happen when the fisherman handed him a scrap of paper , a hand-scrawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nagle looked into the distance for the fisherman . He saw no one . The salt air blew against the small seashore town of Brielle , tilting the dockside boats and spraying the Atlantic into Nagle 's eyes . When the mist died down he looked again . This time , he saw the fisherman approaching , a small square of paper crumpled in his hands . The fisherman looked worried . Like Nagle , he had lived on the ocean , and he also knew when a man 's life was about to change . // In the whispers of approaching autumn , Brielle 's rouge is blown away and what remains is the real Brielle , the locals ' Brielle . This small seashore town on the central New Jersey coast is the place where the boat captains and fishermen live , where convenience store owners stay open to serve neighbors , where fifth graders can repair scallop dredges . This is where the hangers-on and wannabes and also-rans and once-greats keep believing in the sea . In Brielle , when the customers leave , the town 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thin difference between making a living on the water and washing out . // The Seeker towers above the other boats tied to this Brielle dock , and it 's not just the vessel 's sixty-five-foot length that grabs one 's attention , it 's the feeling-from her battered wooden hull and nicked propellers-that she 's been places . Conceived in Nagle 's imagination , the Seeker was built for a single purpose : to take scuba divers to the most dangerous shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean . // Nagle was forty years old then , a thin , deeply tanned former Snap-On Tools Salesman of the Year . To see him here , waiting for this fisherman in his tattered T-shirt and thrift-shop sandals , the Jim Beam he kept as best friend slurring his motions , no one would guess that he had been an artist , that in his day Nagle had been great . // In his twenties , Nagle was already legend in shipwreck diving , a boy wonder in a sport that regularly kills its young . In those days , deep-wreck diving was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even famous ones , lay undiscovered at the bottom of the Atlantic , and the hunt for those wrecks-with their bent metal and arrested history-was the motion that primed Nagle 's imagination . // Treasure never figured into the equation for Atlantic shipwreck divers in the Northeast . Spanish galleons overflowing with gold doubloons and silver pieces of eight did not sink in this part of the ocean , and even if they had , Nagle would n't have been interested . His neighborhood was the New York and New Jersey shipping lanes , waters that conducted freighters , ocean liners , passenger vessels , and warships about the business and survival of America . These wrecks occasionally surrendered a rare piece of china or jewelry , but Nagle and his kind were looking for something different . They saw stories in the Modiglianied faces of broken ships , frozen moments in a nation 's hopes or a captain 's dying instinct or a child 's potential , and they experienced these scenes unbuffered by curators or commentators or historians , shoulder to shoulder with life as it existed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to explore . Many of the deep wrecks had n't been seen since their victims last looked at them , and would remain lost while nature pawed at them until they simply did n't exist anymore . In a world where even the moon had been traveled , the floor of the Atlantic remained uncharted wilderness , its shipwrecks beacons for men compelled to look . // You had to have steel balls to do what Nagle did in his heyday . In the 1970s and 1980s , scuba equipment was still rudimentary , not much advanced past 1943 , when Jacques Cousteau helped invent the system of tanks and regulators that allowed men to breathe underwater . Even at 130 feet , the recreational limit suggested by most scuba training organizations , a minor equipment failure could kill the most skilled practitioner . In searching for the most interesting wrecks , Nagle and the sport 's other kings might descend to 200 feet or deeper , virtually begging the forces of nature to flick them into the afterlife , practically demanding their biology to abandon them . Men died-often-diving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's equipment and body could survive the deep Atlantic , he faced a smorgasbord of other perils , each capable of killing him ? la carte . For starters , the sport was still new ; there was no ancient wisdom to be passed from father to son , the kind of collective experience that routinely keeps today 's divers alive . The sport 's cautionary tales , those lifelines learned over beers with buddies and by reading magazines and attending classes , were beaten into Nagle underwater at antihuman depths . If Nagle found himself in some crazy , terrible circumstance-and there were countless of them on these deep wrecks-odds were that he would be the one who would tell the first tale . When he and his ilk survived , the magazines wrote articles about them . // Nagle pushed deeper . Diving below 200 feet , he began doing things scientists did n't fully understand , going places recreational divers had never been . When he penetrated a shipwreck at these depths , he was often among the first to see the vessel since it had gone down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been closed , the first to look at these men since they had been lost at sea . But this also meant that Nagle was on his own . He had no maps drawn by earlier divers . Had someone visited these wrecks before , he might have told Nagle , " Do n't brush against that outboard beam in the galley-the thing moved when I swam by , and the whole room might cave in and bury you if you do . " Nagle had to discover all this by himself . It is one thing , wreck divers will tell you , to slither in near-total darkness through a shipwreck 's twisted , broken mazes , each room a potential trap of swirling silt and collapsing structure . It is another to do so without knowing that someone did it before you and lived . // The Atlantic floor was still a wilderness in Nagle 's prime , and it demanded of its explorers the same grit that the American West did of its pioneers . A single bad experience on a shipwreck could reroute all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Nagle had bad experiences every day . The sport eagerly shook out its dabblers and sightseers ; those who remained seemed of a different species . They were physical in their world orientation and sudden in their appetites . They thought nothing of whipping out a sledgehammer and beating a porthole from the side of a ship , even as their heavy breath hastened nitrogen narcosis , the potentially deadly buildup of that otherwise benign gas in their brains . Underwater , rules of possession bent with the light ; some divers cut prizes from the mesh goody bags of other divers , following the motto " He who floats it owns it . " Fistfights-aboard boats and even underwater-often settled disputes . Artifacts recovered from wrecks were guarded like firstborn children , occasionally at knifepoint . In this way , early deep-wreck divers had a measure of pirate in their blood . // But not Nagle . In the sport 's brawniest era , he was a man of the mind . He devoured academic texts , reference works , novels , blueprints , any material he could uncover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dockyards of a dozen eras and built the boats alongside the workers . He was a connoisseur of the parts , and he reveled in the life force a boat took on from the interlocking of its pieces . This insight gave Nagle two-way vision ; as much as he understood the birth of a ship , he also understood its death . Ordinary divers would come upon a shipwreck and see the m ? lange of bent steel and broken wood , the shock of pipe and wire as a cacophony of crap , an impediment that might be hiding a compass or some other prize . They would plant their noses in a random spot and dig like puppies , hoping to find a morsel . Viewing the same scene , Nagle repaired the broken parts in his mind and saw the ship in its glory . One of his greatest finds was a four-foot-tall brass whistle from the paddle wheeler Champion , a proud voice that had been mounted on the ship 's mast and powered by a steam line . The whistle was majestic , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looked like a worthless pipe . Floating amid the wreckage , Nagle used his mind 's eye to watch the ship break and sink . He knew the ship 's anatomy , and as he imagined it coming apart he could see the whistle settle , right where that seemingly worthless piece of pipe lay . After Nagle recovered two helms from the British tanker Coimbra in a single day ( finding one helm once in a career was rare enough ) , his photograph was hung-alongside that of Lloyd Bridges-in the wheelhouse of the Sea Hunter , a leading dive charter boat of the time . He was twenty-five . // To Nagle , the value in artifacts like the brass steam whistle lay not in their aesthetics or their monetary worth but in their symbolism . It is an odd sight to see grown men covet teacups and saucers , and build noble display cases to these dainty relics . But to divers like Nagle these trinkets represented exploration , going off the charts . A telegraph on display in a diver 's living room , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an announcement . It says , If someone had been to this ship 's wheelhouse before me , he would not have left this telegraph behind . // It was only time before Nagle 's instinct delivered him to the Andrea Doria , the Mount Everest of shipwrecks . The grand Italian passenger liner had collided with the Stockholm , a Swedish liner , in dense fog off Nantucket Island in 1956 . Fifty-one people died ; 1,659 were rescued before the liner sank and settled on her side at a depth of 250 feet . The Doria was not a typical target for Nagle . Her location was widely known , and she had been explored by divers since the day after her sinking . But the Doria made siren calls to great wreck divers . She was brimming with artifacts even after all these years : serving sets made of fine Italian china and painted with the ship 's legendary Italia logo , silver utensils , luggage , ceramic tiles by famed artists , pewter sherbet dishes , jewelry , signs . In Nagle 's day , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only about having enough stamina to lug home the prizes he recovered . // Had the Doria only her riches to offer , she could not have romanced Nagle so hopelessly . The ship 's real challenge lay in exploration . The wreck rested on its side , making navigation dangerous and deceptive . A diver had to conceive the world sideways to make sense of doors on the floor and ceilings to the right . And she was deep-180 feet at her shallowest and 250 feet where she crushed the ocean floor . Men sometimes got disoriented or ran out of air or lost their minds from narcosis and died on the Doria . The wreck was so deep , dark , and dangerous that decades after her sinking , entire decks remained unexplored . Those decks were Nagle 's destinations . // Over time , Nagle penetrated the wreck in places long relegated to the impossible . His mantel at home became a miniature Doria museum . Soon , he set his sights on the bell . A ship 's bell is her crown , her voice . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the greats go a career without coming close to recovering one . Nagle decided to own the Doria 's bell . People thought he was nuts-scores of divers had searched for thirty years for the Doria 's bell . No one believed it was there . // Nagle went to work . He studied deck plans , books of photographs , crew diaries . Then he did what few other divers did : he formulated a plan . He would need days , maybe even a week to pull it off . No charter boat , however , was going to take a diver to the Doria for a week . So Nagle , who had saved a good bit of money from his Snap-on Tools days , decided to buy a dive boat himself , a vessel constructed from his imagination for a single purpose : to salvage the Doria 's bell . // That boat was the original Seeker , a thirty-five-foot Maine Coaster built in New Jersey by Henrique . In 1985 , Nagle recruited five top divers , men who shared his passion for exploration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group to the Doria at his expense . The trip would be a dedicated one , meaning the divers went with just one objective-to recover the bell . // For the first few days on the wreck , the divers stuck to Nagle 's plan . They found nothing . The bell just was n't there . At that point , even the hardiest divers would have turned back . A single day on the open Atlantic in a sixty-five-foot boat will turn intestines inside out ; Nagle and his cohorts had been out for four days in a thirty-five-foot glorified bathtub . But a man is not so inclined to give up when he sees in panoramas . Nagle abandoned the bow of the Doria , where he and his team had been searching , and rerouted to the stern . They would now be flying by the seat of their pants , an improvisation on the deadliest wreck in the Atlantic . No one had ever been to the stern . Yet by conceiving the Doria as a single , breathing organism rather than as detached , twenty-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed themselves to look in unlikely places . // On the fifth day they hit pay dirt-there was the Andrea Doria 's bell . The men rigged it , beat out the bell 's pin with a sledgehammer , and sent up the prize on a heavy-duty lift bag . Shock waves rippled through the diving community . According to their agreement , Nagle owned half the bell , and the other five men owned half ; the last man living among them would own it outright . Nagle placed the 150-pound bell into the back of his wife 's station wagon and asked her to drive it home . //
