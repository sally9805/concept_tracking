" It is n't a housekeeper you need , Mr. Thompson , it 's a wife . " " A wife . " The word went through Travis like a bullet , and he soared to his feet . He slammed his Stetson back on his head , shoving it down so far it shadowed the starkly etched planes of his jaw and cheekbones . He paled beneath the weathered , sun-beaten tan . It had been two months since his brother and sister-in-law 's funeral , and he 'd barely stepped outside the ranch house since he 'd been appointed the guardian of their three children . He might as well forget thirty-six years of ranch life and take up being a full-time mother . All he seemed to do was cook , wash clothes , and read bedtime stories . The worst of it was that according to five-year-old Beth Ann and the two boys , Jim and Scotty , he was n't doing any of those jobs worth a damn . " Mommy would n't like you saying the ' s ' word , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped from his mouth . The kid made it sound as though his sister-in-law would leap straight out of the grave to reprimand him . Hell , she probably would if it were possible . " Mom used to say ' yogurt ' instead , " Beth Ann announced , her eyes a soft cornflower blue . Janice 's eyes . Everything about the bundle-size youngster reminded Travis ofhis petite sister-in-law . The thick blond hair , the gentle laugh , and the narrowed , disapproving look . The look that spoke a hundred words without uttering a one of them . Janice had had a way about her that could cut straight through an argument and silence him as no one else had ever done . Travis stared at Beth Ann , and his heart clenched . Godalmighty , he missed Janice . Nearly as much as he did Lee . " Your mother used to say ' yogurt ' ? " Travis had asked , confident he had n't heard her correctly . Jim nodded . " Mom said yogurt was a much better word than the ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine word , " Beth Ann added . " If one of us got into something we should n't , " Scotty , who was eight , was quick to clarify , " Mom would say we were in deep yogurt . " That was supposed to have explained everything , Travis guessed . His language , Travis learned soon enough , was only the tip of the iceberg . Within a week he discovered that washing little girls ' clothes with boys ' clothes damn near ruined the girl things . Hell , he did n't know any different . Okay , so Beth Ann wore a pink dress , one that had once been white , to church on Sunday . It could have been worse . Church was another thing , Travis mused darkly . Generally he attended services when the mood struck him , which he freely admitted was only about once every other year , if then . Now it seemed he was expected to show up every week in time for Sunday school with three grade-school children neatly in tow . It was less trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those youngsters dressed and to church on time . Raising God-fearing children was what Janice would have wanted , Clara Morgan had primly informed him on the first of her proven-to-be-weekly visits . Dear Lord save him from interfering old women . God , however , had given up listening to Travis a good long time ago . No doubt it was because he swore with such unfailing regularity . Everything had come to a head the day before . Heaven knew Travis was trying as hard as he could to do right by Lee and Janice 's children . He 'd damn near given up the management of his ranch to his hired hands . Instead he was dealing with do-good state social workers , old biddies from the local Grange , and three grieving children . The final straw came when he 'd arrived home with a truckload of groceries a few days earlier . The boys , Jim and Scotty , were helping him carry in the badly needed supplies . " You did n't buy any more of those frozen diet dinners , did you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen , helped by his younger brother . " No . I told you boys before , that was a mistake . " " It tasted like . . . " " Yogurt , " Travis supplied testily . Scotty nodded , and Beth Ann looked on approvingly . Travis dealt with the fencing material he 'd picked up in town and left the three children to finish with the groceries . That was his second mistake in what proved to be a long list . When he entered the house , it was like walking into a San Francisco fog . A thin layer of flour circled the room like a raging dust storm . Beth Ann , looking small and defeated , held on to a broom and was swinging madly . " What the hell happened in here ? " Travis demanded . " It 's Scotty 's fault , " Jim shouted . " He dropped his end of the flour sack . " " It was heavy , " Scotty said . " It caught on the nail . " The nail . No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one had been protruding from the floorboard for the last couple of days . . . all right , a week or more . He 'd meant to pound it down ; would have if it had been a real hazard , but like so many other things , he 'd put it off . " I tried to sweep up the flour , " Beth Ann explained , coughing . Travis waved his hand in front of his face and watched as a perfectly good bag of flour settled like a dusting of snow on every possible crevice of the kitchen . " Do n't worry about it , " he said , taking the broom out of her hand . He leaned it against the wall and surveyed the damage . " If Scotty was n't such a wimp , none of this would have happened , " Jim said . " I 'm not a wimp , " Scotty yelled , and leaped for his brother . Before Travis could stop them , the two were rolling on the floor , wrestling like bear cubs , stirring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them up , ordered Jim out to the barn to do his chores , and did what he could to clean up the mess in the kitchen .
