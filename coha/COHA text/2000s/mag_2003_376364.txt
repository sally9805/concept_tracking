If you 're not looking closely , it 's easy to miss the wi-fi antenna atop San Bruno mountain just south of San Francisco . There are a couple of dozen TV and radio broadcast towers , each about 300 ft. tall , surrounded with chain-link fences and electromagnetic radiation warning signs . The wi-fi antenna is a solitary 18-in. plastic stick that radio engineer Tim Pozar stuck up there on his day off . If it disappeared , fewer than a hundred people would notice . " It takes geeks like me , putting up antennas , to make this work , " says Pozar . <P> What the geeks get in return is nothing short of astonishing . If you live in San Francisco and can see San Bruno or any of 16 other nodes in the home-brew San Francisco Local Area Network ( SFLAN ) , you can stick your own wi-fi antenna on your rooftop , angle it in just the right direction and receive a clear , high-speed Internet connection  --  even from the other side of the city . The cost ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can include an empty Pringles can . After that , you pay nothing . Nada . Zippo . Not a dime in monthly access charges . You and your neighbors get free wi-fi Internet access , perhaps for life . <P> If this sounds like a grownup version of schoolkids connecting tin cans with string for a science fair and dreaming of putting the phone company out of business , well , that 's because it is . Proponents of free wi-fi like Pozar believe that paying for Internet access is as dumb as paying for a radio signal ( which is , of course , exactly what wi-fi is ) . Already their tin cans and string have scored successes from Manhattan to Milwaukee . Small retail outlets such as bookstores and coffee shops are starting to get with the program too . They find that giving away bandwidth is an easy way to attract customers . <P> As for free wi-fi in San Francisco , the city has Brewster Kahle to thank for sowing the seeds of SFLAN back in 1997 . An entrepreneur who sold his search-engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nonprofit that collects and stores a vast library of defunct Web pages . He buys his Internet access wholesale from a local company at the bargain rate of $30 per megabit per month . The archive needs many thousands of megabits to do its job , and Kahle considers the amount of bandwidth that Pozar 's San Bruno antenna requires  --  which costs Kahle less than $200 a month  --  to be insignificant . He is prepared to be far more generous . " We 're a library , " he says . " We 're in the business of giving away information . " <P> Still , SFLAN is in its infancy ; the connections continue to be very buggy and nodes often go down . The next step is to build up a critical mass of roughly 50 nodes , at which point everyone in the city should be able to see at least one antenna . Kahle 's high-speed Internet donation should comfortably support thousands of users , as long as they are not all simultaneously downloading Hollywood movies . If SFLAN gets any larger than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some premium users and offering preferred access to paying customers .
