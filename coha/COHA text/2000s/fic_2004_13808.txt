( SYDNEY and BRAD 'S territory . She is an eight months ' pregnant , picture-perfect , English beauty who possesses a precision and awareness that tells us she is smart . BRAD is a rumpled , feet-on-the-ground , all-Irish American guy . They sit staring outward , shadows of TV lights flickering across their faces . They are so close that they appear to be one . Behind them , the glow of a poet 's moon mystifies . SOUNDS of program clips indecipherably blip by as BRAD points a remote toward the audience . The moon further encroaches , taking over the environment . A SOUND is heard : the dull , singular thump of a closed door hit by a sudden , momentary gust of wind . SYDNEY reacts as if sensing an unseen presence . THE DARK drifts onto the stage in a cloud of mist , the scent of incense emanating . His urban elegance possesses just enough of the streets to make him threatening . African American , he is attractive and masculine with an earthy openness and warmth of spirit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is heard . ) SYDNEY Brad , I heard something . Did you hear it ? BRAD BYRNE It 's the wind . SYDNEY It 's not the wind . ( The TV SOUNDS turn into white noise as SYDNEY investigates . BRAD and TV SOUNDS fade into silence and darkness . SYDNEY stands in a mystical light of which THE DARK seems to be an extension . She can not see him . Candles begin to flicker in the peripheries of the mist . Several dull thumps are heard in a flash , ceasing abruptly as THE DARK moves forward. ) p. 3 THE DARK ( a chant in a poetic hip-hop style ) AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL YOU MEAN SO MUCH TO ME , WELCOMIN ' THE WORLD 'S WEARY , FIGHTIN ' POVERTY , SAVIN ' THIRD-WORLD CHILDREN , WAGIN ' WAR AGAINST SIN , PRESERVIN ' SWEET DEMOCRACY IN EXOTIC PLACES I NEVER BEEN .

I ca n't see you , but I know these smells , this dream . Wh-what do you want from me ? ( A light fades up on BRAD . The TV SOUNDS fade in . ) BRAD BYRNE Honey ! Honey , come on ! I made you cocoa .

( THE DARK vanishes . TV SOUNDS suddenly shift into distracting white noise. ) p. 5 SYDNEY Wait ! ( Lights up on BRAD , TV lights flickering in his face . ) BRAD BYRNE Sydney ? SYDNEY Brad ? BRAD BYRNE Drink your cocoa , honey . ( The TV abruptly turns off and lights shift to darkness except for the infinite , epic moon . BRAD snuggles close to SYDNEY as she stares at the moon . ) BRAD BYRNE You smell good . SYDNEY Patchouli and rain . BRAD BYRNE New perfume ? SYDNEY Well , it was in the air , in the summer wind . Do you smell it ? BRAD BYRNE Uh , no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRAD BYRNE ( a surprised pause , then : ) Maybe it was just the fog mixed with the moonlight , honey . Hapens to me with shower steam . SYDNEY Something was here , Brad . BRAD BYRNE Honey , you 're pregnant , super-sized with hormones . If you told me you just saw the Duke of Windsor , I 'd say hell yeah . SYDNEY But look at the moon , Brad . It 's like time is standing still . Not in a corny way , but like when I 'm on the North Shore of O'ahu watching the sun set and I see the green flash . I hold my breath waiting for something to happen , not knowing what it is or why it is , and then -- there it is , that fleeting bright chartreuse flash across the horizon . And it 's incredible -- a force of nature -- and then it 's gone and you 're not sure if you truly saw it . You think you did , but maybe that 's only because your desire willed it into --  p. 6 BRAD BYRNE Sydney , whoa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my fine Irish white chocolate . ( tries to kiss her ) SYDNEY Brad , have you ever seen the green flash ? BRAD BYRNE I do n't believe anybody 's ever really seen it . It 's fiction , honey . For the tourists . SYDNEY Okay , have you ever seen something phenomenal ? BRAD BYRNE Yeah . You . SYDNEY I mean in nature . BRAD BYRNE You . SYDNEY Brad , I mean something cosmic , mystical . BRAD BYRNE Yeah , when we make love I --  SYDNEY Bradley Byrne , I do not want to be seduced . I want you to take a good look at the moon tonight and understand that it 's even more phenomenal than the green flash . Mother Nature 's talking to us , Brad . BRAD BYRNE Tell her we want a girl . SYDNEY Brad , will you just look at the moon , look how full it is ? BRAD BYRNE That happens every twenty-eight days , Sydney . Like your former period . Why is that so phenomenal ? p. 7 SYDNEY Because it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of tears or something . I feel that if I do n't bow down to it , it will graze me . What if it gets so big that it explodes ? Gold will shower down on us as big as boulders . BRAD BYRNE Not gold : boulders of stinky green cheese . We better take cover . SYDNEY ( frustrated with his pragmatism , but equally as charmed ) Honey , in your world , everything 's made of apple pie , is n't it ? Even the ground is made of apple pie . BRAD BYRNE And our baby will be apple pie , too . Can I help it if I 'm an all-American boy with his feet planted on terra firma ? I was the first kid in Topeka to question the existence of Santa Claus . Hell , in Kansas we did n't even believe in the land of Oz . SYDNEY Once when I was in Greece driving with a lunatic cabbie , I saw an enormous indentation at the base of a mountain . It was as if a rounded hole had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the moon had cascaded to earth , come to rest at the foot of that mountain , and then gone home again . If I ever fell , that 's what I 'd want to do : fall gracefully , leave my mark , and then go back home again . BRAD BYRNE If the moon fell , it could n't go back . It is n't a ball , Sydney . Nothing and nobody can bounce back if they fall too far . p. 8 SYDNEY That ghost , Brad . BRAD BYRNE You mean the one you could have seen if such a thing as ghosts existed ? SYDNEY Yes . That very one . Only I did n't see him ; I sensed him . BRAD BYRNE Let 's go to bed , sweetie . It 's late . SYDNEY Brad . That ghost . I think he was black .

Three spotlights fade up in which appear SYDNEY in a hospital gown , her mouth open as if embodying the voiceover ; BRAD in straight-from-the-office , labor-rumpled attire ; and GRACE-MARIA , a light-skinned African-descent woman : prim , proper , elegant ; perfect coat , perfect purse , perfect hat . Her light possesses elements of the divine . ) SYDNEY ( a breathy , labored rhythm ) **48;2070;TOOLONG . BRAD BYRNE Help her . It 's our first baby . Several weeks early .

GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ ( overlapping ) You can do it . Come on , Sydney : instincts , intuition . SYDNEY Dark earth Terra firma . This is the only map . Arteries of discovery : streams , rivers , ocean currents . BRAD BYRNE Can I help ? What can I do to help ? SYDNEY Another territory . Crossing boundaries . I see the boulders . I need the moonlight . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Even in the darkest night , the moon rises and lights the cave . BRAD BYRNE Sydney , hold onto me . Hold on tight . SYDNEY ( breathless , pitching into the fervor of giving birth ) Miners were here . They mined quartz for gold . They dug it out of the earth , crushed it , grabbed the gold , tossed away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They fled . The landscape was changed . Was it still beautiful , even when the gold had vanished ? Was it just a cave : damp , dank , dark , and full of the wounds of history ? ( screams in pain : the moment of birth segueing into ) ( a crescendoing birth cry . All three follow the sound with expectation and joy . GRACE-MARIA raises her hands up to the heavens . Her light goes out and she exits . The cries decrescendo , grow wondrous. ) p. 11 SYDNEY Can I see her ? Is she okay ? Bradley , what 's the matter ? BRAD BYRNE Look at all that black hair . That 's the Irish in her . And her skin . Like moonlight . SYDNEY Is she all right ? Ten fingers , ten toes ? BRAD BYRNE Look at her . You can just feel she 's brilliant . ( The sound of a baby 's labored breathing fades in , accompanied with sounds of crying and coughing . ) BRAD BYRNE What 's the matter ? SYDNEY Is she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The breathing , cries , coughing , and lights abruptly cease. ) p. 12 Act 1 , Scene 3 Scene Three ( Several days later . A light flashes on and off on a neonatal Isolette bed upstage , distant . The sound of a baby 's heartbeat and challenged breathing , as well as the sound of neonatal machinery , hums low . Through the course of the scene , these sounds will crescendo , but never compete with the action . SYDNEY , in robe and slippers , appears in a down stage light . This is definitely not her territory . A disheveled BRAD appears . ) BRAD BYRNE How are you feeling , honey ? SYDNEY Smashing . Her heart is fine now ; it was just the rigors of the long labor . But there 's something else . BRAD BYRNE Whatever it is , it 's going to be okay , okay ? What did the pediatric surgeon say ? A black lady , huh ? Cool . SYDNEY The breathing issues she had the rapid breaths it 's one of those syndromes , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distress . Everything 's distress . When she comes home , she 'll be more susceptible to serious respiratory infections and asthma . Exposure to smoke in her early years could kill her . And the fluorescent lights ? They 're for jaundice . She has that too . BRAD BYRNE But she 's going to be okay , honey . p. 13 SYDNEY It 's a long time to that okay . I 'll have gnashed my teeth into stumps by then . BRAD BYRNE Are you worried about losing time from work ? Sydney , you 're stellar . Even more so because now you 're not only a cinemagender guru , but a mommy too . That 's a badge of courage . If anything , you 'll have more prestige . SYDNEY Film professors do n't care about mommies , only about mommy characters on celluloid . Right , there 's maternity leave and all that good stuff . Rah-rah . But I 've seen it happen before . The male professors just say they 're having a baby . The female professors blow up like blimps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're the same people , if not better , but they are n't seen as being the same people . Especially in film school where half the faculty are childless gay men and another third are women who never got around to having children or did n't want to . BRAD BYRNE Sydney , maybe you 're experiencing a little post-partum depression . Everything 's going to be okay . And we 'll be really careful . We wo n't break our little Caitlin . We 'll take vitamins and Echinacea . We 'll become anti-smoking fanatics . How 's that ? ( Lights shift and they move to the Isolette bed , standing on the edges of its flashing lights . ) SYDNEY Just look how fragile she is. p. 14 BRAD BYRNE Gee , she really does look fragile . And so little . You know , she looks kind of I do n't know different . SYDNEY What do you mean " different " ? BRAD BYRNE Maybe these lights are burning her skin . She looks like , I do n't know ; like she 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaundice . It makes her skin a little yellow-reddish . BRAD BYRNE Yellow-reddish ? I 'd call it brown . Sydney , she 's brown . SYDNEY Do n't be absurd . It 's the lighting . BRAD BYRNE NO . In fact , she almost looks well , she almost looks black . ( SYDNEY and BRAD look at each other questioningly . Lights cut to three spotlights into which step BRAD , SYDNEY , and GRACE-MARIA . Sounds of a baby 's whimpering , occasional mild crying , and slightly labored breathing can be heard softly in the background . ) SYDNEY Jaundice . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ You can tell the color a person 's going to be when she grows up by looking at the color of the cuticles . SYDNEY Cuticles . BRAD BYRNE Cuticles ? p. 15 GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Brown . Medium brown , I 'd surmise . SYDNEY English , Welsh . I go back to the Mayflower . Jamestown . Pilgrim souls . BRAD BYRNE Irish , Irish .

GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Soft , black hair curls up . White hair , hard shaft , no curls , no waves . BRAD BYRNE They used to ask my sister if she permed her hair . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ If there 's any curl in the hair , Africa 's been there . SYDNEY Boulders are falling ; the herald has spoken . BRAD BYRNE Sydney ? She 's ours , right ? Right . Babies do n't get switched these days . SYDNEY When I get nervous , I hold my breath . It 's an instinct . Like hiding in a cave . BRAD BYRNE The hospital wristband matches . She is our daughter . Why is it so hot in here ? Something wrong with the central air ? p. 16 SYDNEY It 's so cold . Shivering cold . The kind of chill you ca n't chase away . BRAD BYRNE But , Sydney , our daughter she 's she 's GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ By the grace of God , there go I. BRAD BYRNE Sh-She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination , but it 's true . She gets a little darker every day . Do n't you see it ? GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Like a photograph slowly fading into a clear image and yet you still can't -- or won't -- recognize it . and fictions reveal themselves . BRAD BYRNE Sydney ? SYDNEY Brad ? BRAD BYRNE What the hell does this all mean ? SYDNEY Phenotypes . Genes . Alleles . Gametes . BRAD BYRNE The stately laws of physics GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ The laws of segregation the random looks of miscegenation . SYDNEY Dominant/recessive fugitive genes . BRAD BYRNE Lurking . Like a ghost . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Lost in the fog of time . p. 17 SYDNEY Thrusting forward , throwing back . BRAD BYRNE The house is haunted . SYDNEY There 's a stranger in the village . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ A photograph slowly coming into focus BRAD BYRNE In black and white . ( BRAD and GRACE-MARIA 'S spotlights immediately black-out . The baby 's sounds abruptly cease .

THE DARK GO BACK IN TIME ; IT 'S ALL PART OF NATURE 'S PLAN . SYDNEY The past is history ; the present surrounds us . THE DARK THE PRESENT 'S ELASTIC , BABY ; HISTORY CONFOUNDS US .

( Mist envelopes THE DARK as his hands reach out to her and he vanishes . The baby 's cry returns as an echo that crescendos as lights fade to black . In the darkness , the cry abruptly ceases with a dirge-like drumbeat marking time as lights fade to black. ) p. 19 Act 1 , Scene 4 Scene Four ( A single , bright , interrogative light . ) BRAD BYRNE Sydney . You 've been seeing someone , have n't you ? SYDNEY Surely you 're joking . BRAD BYRNE This is n't a grin , Sydney ; it 's a snarl . Who are you seeing ? SYDNEY I 've been seeing you . All these years . Is there something I did n't see about you ? Is there something you did n't tell me ? BRAD BYRNE Hey , I 'm Irish all the way back to the Ice Age and Ireland 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . SYDNEY Excuse the hell out of me , but England 's nowhere near Africa either . BRAD BYRNE Any Mediterraneans in your background ? SYDNEY Anyway , do n't they say that we all came from the original mother , that African woman , Eve ? BRAD BYRNE It was that night , was n't it ? That windy night that I made you cocoa and you let it get cold ? I heard you talking to him . You were talking to him on the phone . SYDNEY There was nobody else there , Brad . BRAD BYRNE There has to be somebody else . p. 20 SYDNEY Go to hell . BRAD BYRNE Okay , tell me you were talking to your mother that night . But the second thing you better tell me is who 's the father of your baby . SYDNEY I have not so much as held another man 's hand since I met you four years ago . BRAD BYRNE Maybe you did n't hold his hand , but the evidence indicates that you damn well held something else . SYDNEY That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart , in my belly , in my head . I did n't have an affair , Brad . I know that , so , no matter what you say , it 's got to be you . You and your black Irish self . BRAD BYRNE Just a minute . What do you mean by that ? SYDNEY Black Irish . BRAD BYRNE How dare you . We 're called black Irish because of our dark hair . SYDNEY Your dark and unruly hair . Not to mention the " olive " skin and dark eyes . In fact , your mother could pass for Sicilian . BRAD BYRNE Oh yeah right . And just who told you all this ? You 've been talking to that black pediatric surgeon , have n't you ? I saw how she was grinning the last time she examined Caitlin . She knew . Or did your boyfriend tell you all this ? p. 21 SYDNEY Let the prosecution rest , Brad . BRAD BYRNE NO . Tell me . All those late nights in the library doing " research " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were you doing ? Black Irish my ass . SYDNEY It was last year . A colleague of mine from American studies was doing research . I dismissed it back then , but now , I do n't know . BRAD BYRNE Oh really ? What did this tree-hugging , card-carrying member of the NAACP have to say ? SYDNEY He was white , Brad . Irish American , in fact . BRAD BYRNE Yeah , okay , okay . So what did he say ? SYDNEY That the black Irish evolved from fraternizing between Moors and Irish during the Inquisition when Moorish monks and military came to Ireland . BRAD BYRNE This is incredible . You 'd stoop so low as to taint my ancestry and insult the ethnic sanctity of an entire republic just to side-step the fact that you cheated on me ? I mean , look at me ! I 'm as white as school paste . SYDNEY And you 'd stoop so low as to cast aspersions on my integrity just to side-step the fact that there is black blood in your holierthan-thou Irishness ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molly , Maura , and Fiona flinging up their petticoats to sample the mysteries of the dark . p. 22 BRAD BYRNE You seem to speak with the precision of experience . SYDNEY There are even similarities between Celtic and Moorish art , just like Polynesian art looks African . It 's you , Brad . Shame on you for being so angry . Just admit it and we can survive this thing . BRAD BYRNE Wait a minute . This is twisted . You 're threatening to leave me because I think you 're cheating on me ? SYDNEY Because then the faith is broken . Without trust , we have nothing . And it 's not a threat . It 's how I feel . BRAD BYRNE And , let me get this straight , you 'd leave me because I wo n't accept your Afro-compulsive B.S. about the black Irish ? SYDNEY It 's not B.S. It 's logic , nature . When you get close to Africa or Africa comes knocking on your door or you drag Africa into your home to wash your dishes , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works . BRAD BYRNE You 're trying to deflect the truth by attacking my background and even calling your own into question when the only real issue is adultery . SYDNEY And you 're desperate to prove that you 're as white as school paste -- which you are not -- even if it means calling me a whore and making yourself look like the poor , beleaguered , stupid husband . p. 23 BRAD BYRNE I do n't mind looking stupid as long as I can have my integrity . SYDNEY Integrity ? Brad , you 're a trial lawyer . BRAD BYRNE You 're scared , are n't you ? SYDNEY You 're supposed to trust me . BRAD BYRNE And what 's that gotten me but a starring role in " Guess Who 's Coming to the Nursery " ? What does he look like ? Is he a movie star kind of black guy or a Mike Tyson thug ? When you met him did you think about all those myths they have about black men ? Did you think about that and then feel compelled to do some research , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he kiss better than me ? Is he a better lover ? Does he have an enormous penis and the stamina of Mandingo ? Does he love you ? are you going to leave me to be with him ? SYDNEY You wish I had cheated on you , do n't you ? Because that 's easy . Then you could play the big-hearted white guy who accepts his cheating wife and her half-breed love child with open arms.You 'd be damned by the Daughters of the American Revolution , but the humanitarians would worship at your feet . Brad , it would be so simple if I 'd had an affair . It would explain everything so easily and we could get on with our lives , even if it was without each other . Instead , we get mystery . A black poet in the dark , a black baby in the nursery . p. 24 BRAD BYRNE There are no mysteries . Only liars , whores , and fanatics . SYDNEY Well , we know what category you think I fit in . That leaves two categories for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be able to solve them . BRAD BYRNE So I 'm just supposed to roll over and hope that you 'll at least scratch my belly ? Suck up my pride like it 's worth less than snot and go back to the good old routine ? Where in the hell does that leave us , Sydney ? SYDNEY In front of the mirror . We can crack it and run away ; or take a long , hard look at who we are  --  and who we can be with a bit of luck and hard work . BRAD BYRNE Fuck . SYDNEY Yes . Lunacy . I thought we were better than this . Shame on us . BRAD BYRNE Okay then . SYDNEY Okay what ? BRAD BYRNE Then we make the best of it . We have a situation and we make the best of it . SYDNEY Because we 're good and reasonable people , and this is a normal situation . BRAD BYRNE Right . Normal . Apple pie . We just do , we just be , we just keep on keeping on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what about faith ? BRAD BYRNE Hell , that too . I ca n't live without you . SYDNEY Okay then . BRAD BYRNE Okay . SYDNEY She 's not really black anyway . Nobody 's the color of tar . Hair is black , but there 's no black skin . My baby 's the color of coffee when you put lots of cream in it . BRAD BYRNE People will think we adopted her . That 's an advantage . We 'll look so P.C. SYDNEY Brad . BRAD BYRNE It 's true . We might as well exploit the fringe benefits . We 'll be the coolest white people around . SYDNEY Do n't talk about her like she 's a gadget we ordered to make us look hip . Besides , noboday will think she 's adopted because our friends and neighbors know that we were having our baby , and they 'll see us bring her home from the hospital when she 's well . What they 'll think is that I 'm a slut . Only strangers will think she 's adopted . We wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get either . " Oh , she 's so beautiful , " they say . " She looks just like you . " No one will say she looks just like me . BRAD BYRNE Even if she does . p. 26 SYDNEY And no one may even say she 's beautiful because BRAD BYRNE Because she 's not white ? Oh come on , Sydney . We 're beyond all that . SYDNEY Are we ? You never dated a black woman . BRAD BYRNE Sydney , talking about race is so twentieth-century . SYDNEY I 've never even heard you say a black woman was beautiful . BRAD BYRNE Who 's your favorite black star ? Who 's the handsomest black guy you know ? SYDNEY Brad , stop it . BRAD BYRNE It 's just that everybody 's going to think you slept with some black guy and your dufus honky husband does n't have a clue . SYDNEY Brad , this ca n't be about saving your ego . BRAD BYRNE What are we saving then ? You mean something is actually going to be saved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're saving Caitlin . BRAD BYRNE From what ? SYDNEY From our own stupidity . BRAD BYRNE Neither of us is stupid , Sydney . We wanted to have a baby , our baby , and I think that 's what we have here  --  p. 27 SYDNEY You think ? Shall we get a DNA test so you can be certain that this is a fight you have to fight ? BRAD BYRNE Sure . SYDNEY Oh really ? BRAD BYRNE It 's easy and painless . SYDNEY That 's not the point . Answer the question again , Brad . Consider it a second chance . BRAD BYRNE Is that another threat ? SYDNEY Everything 's a threat to you . Get over it . Answer the question again . BRAD BYRNE Okay then . No ? SYDNEY Good answer . BRAD BYRNE Gee , thanks for making me feel so secure . SYDNEY Right back at you , love . BRAD BYRNE Sydney , do you think we should consider moving ? SYDNEY Moving ? BRAD BYRNE To another city . SYDNEY I 'm not throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's not a reasonable reaction . BRAD BYRNE But nobody would know us . We 'd get a fresh start . Everybody would assume she 's adopted . p. 28 SYDNEY We could also join the Witness Protection Program if you really want to hide , Brad . BRAD BYRNE Okay . I got it . This will solve everything . We could stay here and tell everybody you got donor sperm , but the sperm bank made a mistake and gave you some black guy 's sperm . We could say we used that genius sperm bank up in the Bay Area so at least they 'd know it was a Nobel prize kind of black guy . SYDNEY As long as you do n't mind everybody thinking you 're sterile . BRAD BYRNE Better sterile than cuckold , especially when your backdoor man is black . SYDNEY Oh , Brad . Desperation really makes you sweat . BRAD BYRNE Tell me something . Do you ever sweat ? SYDNEY I endured nearly forty hours of labor , Brad ; the last twelve so excruciating that you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinked . I can save my life without bad fiction . I can solve this mystery with truth . BRAD BYRNE And I thought we did everything right . Went to good schools , followed the rules , got good jobs and took our places in society like solid citizens should and must . SYDNEY We did . Why do you sound like you got the consolation prize ? p. 29 BRAD BYRNE Sydney , hello ? She 's sick and black . SYDNEY There 's medicine to treat her illness . BRAD BYRNE There 's no medicine to treat her blackness . SYDNEY Who say 's blackness needs to be treated ? BRAD BYRNE Maybe before you could argue that from your lectern , espousing your politics about how Women are all united in their gender and that race does n't make a difference , but that book 's out of print now , Professor . SYDNEY ( not so sure ) Race does n't make a difference . It does n't . BRAD BYRNE Right . As two Anglos , we 've been able to live our lives mired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : vote Democrat , shop at Whole Foods , give to the right causes , tip the waiters twenty-five percent , et cetera , et cetera . But look at our lives , Sydney . Our friends are white . Most of our colleagues are white . Most of your students and my clients are white . Our literature , our TV programs , our movies are white . Even most of my shirts are white . We 've been living in a snow globe . This is our wake-up call . And even though it does n't taste so good right now , this is good for us . Race does matter . You know it does . Even to people like us . We wanted a girl , Sydney , not a black girl . p. 30 SYDNEY I did n't think of her in terms of color like I was acquiring a new dress  --  or car . I never said I did n't want a black girl . I just did n't expect her , that 's all . Like the green flash . BRAD BYRNE Admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just made it up . You wanted to believe you were one of the really connected people who saw it and championed its existence . SYDNEY You go ahead and convince yourself that the green flash does not exist , that there can not be some quirk of nature that delivers something different that ca n't be understood , but has to be appreciated  --  for its beauty , its difference , the sheer courage it has to exist in the midst of so many disbelievers . Those kinds of things have to be loved the most and best , to hell with our Puritanical , racist society . I 've seen the green flash . Twice . That 's why I know that it meant something that night when the moon was so full and luminous . BRAD BYRNE At least in " Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner ? " you figure that the black guy 's leaving at some point or at least you do n't have to live with him . But in " Guess Who 's Coming to the Nursery ? " the options are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we are no longer white . SYDNEY Of course we are . BRAD BYRNE NO . Everybody will perceive us differently . p. 31 SYDNEY I am only interested in the way that one person perceives me . And that 's Caitlin . That 's why I 'm going to try to figure this all out while she 's in the hospital for the next few weeks . BRAD BYRNE What about your fears that your professional prestige could be threatened ? SYDNEY No matter what it costs , it 's okay , Brad , because I know I 'm being given this reprieve to get ready . To get ready for Caitlin . BRAD BYRNE But we did the nursery . SYDNEY But we did n't do us . I did n't do me . ( SYDNEY kisses him on the cheek and leaves . Befuddled , he watches her walk away as lights fade. ) p. 32 Act 1 , Scene 5 Scene Five ( Lights fade up on another territory , not SYDNEY 'S but one with which she used to be very familiar . SYDNEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poised , faces a tired and disheveled SYDNEY . ) SYDNEY It started out as a cold , but because her lungs are weak , it escalated into pneumonia . JESSICA SPENCER I 'm so sorry , dear . I guess she has your father 's lungs . SYDNEY She has some other things that require guessing , too . JESSICA SPENCER You do n't have to solve the mysteries of the universe for her just yet darling . SYDNEY You know what I 'm talking about , Mother . JESSICA SPENCER Pardon ? SYDNEY It takes less than a second to see it . JESSICA SPENCER Oh that . SYDNEY " Oh that " ? That 's all you can say ? Yes : that . JESSICA SPENCER And ? SYDNEY Why ? JESSICA SPENCER I have no idea . Genes are a peculiar thing . Strand after strand of knowledge about who we are  --  our looks , our bone structure , our coloring . p. 33 SYDNEY Everybody in our family looks anemically ashen . Except for Caitlin . Is there something you 'd like to tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should tell me ? JESSICA SPENCER No . SYDNEY Is there something you could tell me ? JESSICA SPENCER Yes . You look tired , dear . SYDNEY Because I 've been walking the floors unable to figure out why I 'm a white woman who gave birth to a black baby . JESSICA SPENCER They get darker as they get older , you know . Look at the color of the pigment around her cuticles . That 's the color she 'll be when she 's older . ( SYDNEY briefly studies her own cuticles . ) JESSICA SPENCER With a boy , you can tell by looking at the color of the testes . SYDNEY Why , Mother ? JESSICA SPENCER Children are born lighter because they 've been in amniotic fluid and out of the sun for so  --  SYDNEY You know what I mean . JESSICA SPENCER No , I do n't . What I do know is that you are not yourself . p. 34 SYDNEY That 's the understatement of the year . Who am I , Mother ? Enlighten me . JESSICA SPENCER You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing get the best of her . Go home , Sydney . Have a glass of wine and spend time with your husband . Do n't ask questions . Do n't feel you have to explain anything to anybody . Live your life . But , of course , you 've always done things your way . I said ballet , you chose modern . I said English saddle , you chose western . I said law school , you chose cinema-gender studies . I said marry a man who was stronger than you ; you chose Brad . SYDNEY Tell me the truth , Mother . JESSICA SPENCER About what ? SYDNEY You know damn well about what . JESSICA SPENCER About race ? About black and white ? Are you joking ? That 's as old as time , Sydney , as old as a rainbow of pigment going from the lightest brown that we call white in Scandinavia to the darkest brown that we call black in India and Africa , with every hue in between growing from light to dark as you go south from Norway ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selecting the most beautiful African women and the handsomest African men as house slaves so that they 'd be as near  --  and dear  --  as possible ; as old as Castilians and indigenous peoples and Africans mixing their blood into the mestizo who 's the majority of Latin America . That truth ? Is that what you meant ? That 's not a truth . That 's the cauldron of history , the pot and the kettle calling each other names when they both amount to the same thing , the subterfuge and illusion that leaves a bitter taste in the soul . That 's Anglos creating the notion of race in a desperate attempt to distinguish themselves from anything even slightly swarthy . Do you know Benjamin Franklin classified Germans , Greeks , Italians , Jews , and Eastern Europeans as blacks ? p. 35 SYDNEY Why are you so upset , Mother ? For goodness sake . JESSICA SPENCER You 're not so good anymore , my dear Sydney . Not to them . SYDNEY Them ? JESSICA SPENCER You do n't know about them , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all your life , you 've been the golden-haired , blue-eyed thing that defined the ideal anywhere in the world . Go home and close your door , or you can kiss that privilege good-bye . Keep pushing and you 'll find yourself on the other side with the rest of them over there looking at you like one surveys something different  --  desirable , yes , but they wo n't admit it in public and , if you get too close , well , there 's simply nobody home . SYDNEY But even if I was mixed with black , which I do n't think I am , right ? Right ? Even if I was , it should n't matter anymore . It 's the twenty-first century . Black is cool ; hip-hop permeates nearly everything . JESSICA SPENCER ( a pause , then : ) Do you remember that dream you used to have when you were little ? The one about having tea ? ( SYDNEY shakes her head ) I never understood how you could know it , how you could find it out there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother talked about . Her grandmother  --  Delia  --  escaped from a plantation where she was a house slave . She took her brother 's daughter , Victoria , with her . Her brother was dead because it was discovered he 'd had relations with the master 's wife . Victoria knew her mother was the white woman in the big house ; the white woman who never finished her tea biscuits so there would be scraps in the kitchen for the little slave girl . And Victoria ate them and learned to love tea . And she cried the day that Delia said they were going to escape . She cried for the mother who loved her but had never held her . My mother used to talk to you about how precious tea was , how there was some kind of magic in it because it had been graced by her own great-grandmother 's lips and then handed down . It was the only visceral connection to our maternal past , never mind that it was cold and leftover . When Delia escaped , she took only a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , a bag of tea , and one precious quadroon lass . p. 36 SYDNEY Tea I love it so much . I always thought it was because our people were English . JESSICA SPENCER They were . SYDNEY But they were something else , too . JESSICA SPENCER It 's so warm today . Do you want some lemonade ? SYDNEY You never drink tea . JESSICA SPENCER It has a bitter after-taste . SYDNEY Not if you add sugar and cream . JESSICA SPENCER There is n't enough sugar and cream in the world to make that bitterness go away . SYDNEY The flavor of the tea leaves it transports me . JESSICA SPENCER Are you certain it 's a place you want to go ? Once you go there , you wo n't be able to come back and be Sydney Spencer again : that flaxen goddess who won the spelling bee and the beauty pageant , who got into one of the best colleges , who got the job hands down , who always has the door opened for her , who everybody stops for in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who the police lay down their lives for in the name of mother , God , and country . SYDNEY Something happened to you , something that made you seek cover . Please trust me with it . Talk to me. p. 37 JESSICA SPENCER ever seen a picture of my grandmother ? SYDNEY You said she did n't like to be photographed because she was afraid that the camera stole pieces of her soul . JESSICA SPENCER Does that sound like something a white woman would say ? SYDNEY So she was JESSICA SPENCER Not dark-dark , but brown , like cinnamon ; brown with red in it , like Georgia clay , like the earth in the pineapple fields in Hawai'i . SYDNEY But you liked that earth . When you went to Hawai'i with us , you had us stop the car so you could scoop it in your fist . JESSICA SPENCER But that was private . I did n't tell you why I did it or what it meant to me . And then I went back to my real life . SYDNEY Without skipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like I 'm doing right now . But I do n't have to make it a public issue . I do n't have to end up on " Oprah " telling the whole world how my white best friend did n't want to drink after me once she found out I was mixed or the three black girls who cut my hair and tried to cut my throat because they hated mixed bloods or how I moved far away from Alabama so I could leave all that behind me and marry a man who I never told about my **25;2170;TOOLONG tea and biscuits . p. 38 SYDNEY But tea has a history , Mother . We have to honor that . JESSICA SPENCER History ? It is n't as sacrosanct as we like to pretend . It is , after all , recorded by people , mostly by white men . It 's their story , revised as they wrote it , to fit their needs and benefit their children 's futures . And honor ? You can forget about that ; it 's no longer in the dictionary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how this might affect your job ? SYDNEY I work at an institution of higher learning , Mother . JESSICA SPENCER Do you know how hard it is for some black professors to get tenured ? Especially controversial black professors ? Especially half-breeds who blacks wo n't trust and whites wo n't understand ? And if you do n't care about making your own life harder , what about Brad ? He has to get clients  --  and keep them . SYDNEY Mother , since I was little you told me that I should have no biases , that I should embrace all people , no matter their race . JESSICA SPENCER That was before you insisted on risking childbirth . SYDNEY Now I understand the real reason you did n't want me to have children . You said it was for my career . p. 39 JESSICA SPENCER It is your career . It 's your whole life , Sydney . You 're risking everything . SYDNEY It 's time to take some other risks . JESSICA SPENCER Leave me out of it , all of it . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's not like that anymore . People do n't care about race these days . Some white people even want to be black . JESSICA SPENCER Bullshit . SYDNEY Mother ! JESSICA SPENCER They want to be black for five minutes because they think it 's cool ; it 's a fad , it makes them seem stylish . But , behind closed doors , they do n't want to swap spit with their black peers . Most of them do n't want to date or  --  Heavens to Betsy  --  marry blackness ; sometimes they do n't even want to socialize with blackness or work with it or even sit beside it on the train for fear of being raped or mugged . They just want to put on blackness like a costume , a charade of consciousness that truly only shows the lack thereof . But the best part for them is , when the night has tired them out and it 's over , they can take off the costume and write it off to good will . They can shed blackness . They can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize they have . It 's one thing to appreciate blackness , to admire it as one does any kind of interesting art ; it 's altogether another thing to be it , to be it for real . p. 40 SYDNEY I ca n't leave you out of it . JESSICA SPENCER I 'm not going with you on this trip , Sydney . I like my life just the way it is . SYDNEY You make it sound as though I 'm about to enter a foreign country . JESSICA SPENCER You are . And as an alien . As a clueless white immigrant . ( a pause , then : ) Do n't be too certain you 'll be welcome . You do n't have a passport and , when they take one look at you , I doubt if they 'll be rushing to issue one . I do n't even know if they 'll have tea . Maybe they 've forgotten it or chosen to forget it because it 's part of that whole antebellum nightmare that none of us really needs to be reminded of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never take Caitlin for a walk for fear people will wonder ? JESSICA SPENCER Yes , well SYDNEY I love you anyway , Mom . I have to go back to the hospital . To my girl . I already love her more than I love you . ( about to exit ) JESSICA SPENCER ( a pause , then : ) Sydney ? SYDNEY Yes ? JESSICA SPENCER Delia means " dark " in the Welsh tongue . p. 41 SYDNEY I see . JESSICA SPENCER And Caitlin means  --  SYDNEY Pure in English English . I know . ( about to exit again ) JESSICA SPENCER Sydney ? SYDNEY Yes , mother . JESSICA SPENCER There 's a cousin . SYDNEY I have a cousin ? JESSICA SPENCER Perhaps . Distant . Black . SYDNEY Black ? All black ? JESSICA SPENCER How the hell should I know ? He wrote me a letter about a year ago asking for help with some research he was conducting about his family . ( a pause ) I did n't write him back . ( They gaze at each other as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , Scene 6 Scene Six ( Again , the singular dull thump of a wind-rushed door is heard . THE DARK stands center stage in a spot-light .

THEO SCHUBERT enters in stylish glasses , a tasteful jacket  --  a look that reads African American intellectual . They stare at each other from across the distance ; it is neither 's territory . ) SYDNEY there was this man . THEO SCHUBERT A man you ca n't even refer to by name ? SYDNEY I mean like , well , a ghost . THEO SCHUBERT You saw a ghost . Okay . SYDNEY I 'm not exactly sure , but well , he appeared out of nowhere and spoke in a peculiar way . THEO SCHUBERT What do you mean by peculiar ? SYDNEY Like poetry , but with edge , with a rhythm full of restlessness and the past . He said many things , things that told me he could see inside of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ghost . " SYDNEY Heavens no . THEO SCHUBERT Why do you say it like that ? SYDNEY Well , he was black and  --  p. 45 THEO SCHUBERT I see . So you profess to see spirits and follow their instructions , but you cry out for God at the mere thought of loving a black man . SYDNEY No , I did n't mean it like  --  THEO SCHUBERT And yet you called me and I was polite enough to come over here where you live and  --  SYDNEY Sorry to make you come to a white neighborhood . THEO SCHUBERT Every neighborhood 's a white neighborhood . We get used to that . We 're either invisible , or you hold your purses closer and call the police if we get out of our cars . Even if we 're wearing suits . Especially if we 're wearing suits . SYDNEY You see , Dr. Schubert , I  --  THEO SCHUBERT You may call me Theo . SYDNEY Theo . THEO SCHUBERT Yes . SYDNEY ( stares at him for a beat too long ) You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that you want . What is it you 're lacking in your life that would make you telephone a stranger and attempt to articulate him as family ? p. 46 SYDNEY Well , I I had a baby . THEO SCHUBERT Let me guess . You got involved with a young African American man  --  perhaps one of your students ?  --  and you gave birth to his child and now you want to unlock the secrets of the black universe . How close am I ? Am I cold ? Hot ? SYDNEY I had a baby with my husband . THEO SCHUBERT Given your earlier hailing of heaven with regard to the black seed , we can be certain that your husband is white and your baby , too . So what exactly is the problem and what does it have to do with me ? SYDNEY Well she does n't look like me . THEO SCHUBERT ( a moment 's pause and then : ) Too bad . SYDNEY ( an electrical moment for both ) Thank you . THEO SCHUBERT You 're welcome . Does she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks more like me , but then she does n't look like me . In ways that people notice . THEO SCHUBERT You mean like the eyes ? SYDNEY No , I mean like the skin . I mean , well , she 's dark . p. 47 THEO SCHUBERT Dark ? You mean ? SYDNEY Brown . THEO SCHUBERT Very ? SYDNEY Very . THEO SCHUBERT Ah . SYDNEY Why do you say it like that ? THEO SCHUBERT I merely said " ah . " How can you read anything from a monosyllabic declaration uttered in the context of fatigue and general curiosity ? SYDNEY There 's nothing general about you . Everything about you is specific , exact , precise . So tell me what you really think . THEO SCHUBERT Okay . You look like a Swedish country girl who never let the sun shine on her . What about your husband ? Was I correct earlier in assuming that he 's white ? SYDNEY As far as I know , he 's white . THEO SCHUBERT So all the mundane reasons have already been considered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't leave you ? SYDNEY No . Of course not . THEO SCHUBERT Really ? p. 48 SYDNEY Why are you so astonished ? THEO SCHUBERT It 's just that a lot of life is performance , Dr. Byrne . SYDNEY Sydney . And the last name 's Spencer-Byrne , by the way . THEO SCHUBERT Sydney . The face we create for public consumption is seldom our raw , righteous self . We put on a mask and dress up in a costume just to go to work . And when it comes to dating and mating ? Forget it . We 're better than Norma Desmond . If your husband 's wearing a survival mask , ten to one it will shatter when he 's confronted with truth . SYDNEY Oh is that so ? What kind of mask am I wearing then ? What 's my costume ? What 's your costume ? THEO SCHUBERT I 'm black , Sydney . I do n't need a costume . I live in my skin and , if I was n't completely down with that , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time ago . Are you comfortable in your skin ? SYDNEY I used to be . THEO SCHUBERT You might want to get back to that . In our society , it 's a valuable skin , the diamond of pigmentation , if you will . SYDNEY And , by society 's standards , now a flawed diamond at best . What do you think , Theo ? Could we be  --  are we  --  cousins ? p. 49 THEO SCHUBERT Does it really matter ? SYDNEY Of course it does . THEO SCHUBERT Are you certain ? Are you sure you do n't want to be black for fifteen minutes just to see what it 's like , just to tell your friends that you did right by your baby by taking her to the African American history museum once a year ? SYDNEY That 's not fair . THEO SCHUBERT Better I ask you the tough questions than a black stranger with an attitude . SYDNEY But I thought you were a black stranger with an attitude . THEO SCHUBERT Ever sit this close to a black man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course . THEO SCHUBERT When ? SYDNEY I ca n't remember specifically . THEO SCHUBERT Why not ? You 're a specific kind of person , too . Nothing general about you . SYDNEY Life is getting more and more specific every day . THEO SCHUBERT Color has a way of doing that . Maybe you ca n't remember because you 've never before sat by a black man like this , as in breaking bread , as in when it truly mattered . p. 50 SYDNEY How can you suggest that I have n't been around African Americans ? I 'm a professor at a major research institution . I have African American colleagues . I live in a colorless world among reasonable people . I 'm a reasonable person . THEO SCHUBERT So am I , but that does n't mean that a white colleague in a bow tie does n't ask me to refill his coffee when I walk into a psychiatry symposium . " You 're Dr. Schubert ? " they say with expertly suppressed surprise . No , Sydney , reason does n't count for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to a black man where your arms could accidentally brush like this ; ( he brushes his arm against hers ; both feel a charge. ) where I can smell the butter on your breath , where the bread is broken in a way that the crumbs fall on both of our laps . ( a pause , then : ) Have you ? SYDNEY ( a pause as she studies him ) I guess I 'm not as reasonable as I thought . THEO SCHUBERT And you 're not even unreasonable . It 's just that I spend every day as the only black speck in a gaggle of white folks . Whites spend their entire lives mostly being around themselves in their neighborhoods , their boardrooms , their clubs , their cliques . They call it being with people . When one of us enters the picture , they call it " the black guy .

Ninety-five percent of her classmates will be white . Is that reasonable enough for you ? For her ? Maybe when that time comes , you wo n't fancy yourself or your peers to be as reasonable as you like to think you are . p. 51 SYDNEY ( a pause , then : ) Theo , if your research of your family tree shows that there were white people- THEO SCHUBERT When it comes to the children of Africa in America , there are always white people ; usually unirvited white people . SYDNEY But you wrote my mother a letter because you thought she might be a relative . THEO SCHUBERT I did n't know she was white . SYDNEY So if you had known she was white , you would n't have sent her that letter ? THEO SCHUBERT Look , even if you have black blood , so what ? Black people do n't need any more blue-eyed soul ; it 's hard enough trying to collect on their forty acres and a mule . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Westside , raise your little brown girl , and find a performance that gets you through the night . SYDNEY Ca n't I at least look at your research on your roots ? THEO SCHUBERT Sydney , you do n't need me in order to visit blackness . Just go to that museum I mentioned or take an African American studies course . I ca n't validate you . I ca n't write a new history for you . You go research your own family tree-if you truly want to open that door . p. 52 SYDNEY I will then . THEO SCHUBERT You do that . At least then you wo n't have to sneak around meeting black strangers in coffee bars . SYDNEY I 'm not sneaking . Are you ? THEO SCHUBERT So your husband knows you 're here then ? SYDNEY ( quietly ) No . ( THEO hands her a card and turns abruptly to exit . ) THEO SCHUBERT Later , Sydney . SYDNEY Wait ! THEO SCHUBERT What ? Ask . Ask . SYDNEY How reasonable . THEO SCHUBERT Sorry . Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( indicates the card ) Who is Mrs. Marquez ? THEO SCHUBERT Good luck , Sydney .

SYDNEY That man nearly ran you over in the crosswalk . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Oh , I 'm used to it . They do n't stop for black women , not even old ones like me . Even when I was in your condition , nobody stopped for me in the crosswalk . SYDNEY I 'm so sorry . I 'd stop for you , even if there was n't a cross-walk . Here .

Sorry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk . If I squat , I 'll never get up again . I see you 're a tea drinker . Solid , like me . Orange pekoe . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Yes indeed . A drop of Bergamot 's okay , but nothing else . Ladies from my family have been drinking tea since the days of the plantation . Did you know we have a tea habit just like the English ? SYDNEY As a matter of fact , I do . The house slaves would have tea with whatever was left behind after the mistress of the house was finished . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ That 's how we got started . Tea scavengers we were ! Shameless . Black tea , no sugar or cream because that was too good to waste on the help . SYDNEY Well , I hope you can manage with this bag . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Thank you . Congratulations on your new baby . Having a child is always worth it , even when it is n't . It 's a short ride . If the scenery 's beautiful , just take it all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of tea . Have lots of cups of tea . SYDNEY Is it church that makes you so philosophical ? p. 55 GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Yes indeed . My meditation time . Are you a church lady , too ? SYDNEY Used to be . My husband does n't go to church-his father was a minister , but anyway , I stopped going . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ I saw you in my church . SYDNEY Uh , yes . I 'm Sydney Spencer , by the way . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Spencer ? SYDNEY Yes . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Nice English name . You must know who I am since you were following me . SYDNEY I was n't f- GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Ladies should n't lie . The minute the priest greeted me by name , you started shadowing me . What is it that you want ? SYDNEY I 'd like to ask you something . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ What is it , dear ?

He appeared out of nowhere he said he was a tourist GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ A foreigner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like you think , but , then again , he was ; and I was the country he was exploring : the curiosity , the thing he had sacrificed for , the destination . He was like me but he was nothing like me. p. 56 GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ He must have been quite a handsome fellow to tongue-tie you like this . SYDNEY I never saw him ; I only sensed him-like a ghost . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Maybe we 're all countries nobody ever gave us any maps to figure out . Maybe there are all kinds of places we 've yet to visit -- bright meadows and a few dark caves , too . Where I grew up there was a ravine where I 'd count tadpoles in the creek . There was a cave I was so afraid of . I imagined it was for pirates or ragamuffins . But one day I got caught in a rainstorm and , do n't you know , I ran right into that cave because if I had messed up my hairdo after all the trouble my mama went to to make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and biscuits with her . I scooted right in there and , who would have thought , it was coated with smooth , dry boulders . I sat down clean as a baptized baby . SYDNEY So it was a beautiful cave GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Yes indeed . SYDNEY Tell me , Mrs. Marquez , do you recall a Dr. Theodore Schubert ? ( A gust of wind blows from out of nowhere . ) GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ I have to be going now . I have a temperamental cat .

You gave me her name , but I mentioned yours and she ran away . THEO SCHUBERT Did you find out anything on your own ? SYDNEY Genetic throwback theory . THEO SCHUBERT And you understand the ramifications of that ? p. 59 SYDNEY I 'm no scientist , but it 's crystal-clear to me and , frankly , I think I understood already , once I 'd talked to my mother .

BRAD drinks an orange concoction in a champagne flute . He is casually dressed , as if ready for a picnic . While scruffy , there is something sexy and endearing about his look . Enter SYDNEY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SYDNEY Brad , tell me you 're drinking orange juice . Do you realize it 's only ten a.m. ? BRAD BYRNE It 's in tribute to those mornings sipping mimosas at brunch on the San Francisco Bay . Those romantic brunches before wedlock , before making a bady . SYDNEY You 're drunk . BRAD BYRNE Special Irish version : three parts champagne , one part orange juice . I used the calcium fortified kind in the name of good health . I figured I 'd steel my nerves with this and then move on to the wine when our guests arrive . SYDNEY Why would you get drunk when you know this is an important day for me ? For us . You said you could do this . BRAD BYRNE Do what ? I do n't even know what I 'm doing anymore . I do n't know what you 're doing anymore ever since your little revolt when the nurse came to get information for Caitlin 's birth certificate . Delia ? What the hell is Delia ? Why 'd you say that was our daughter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her . Uncommon . BRAD BYRNE It 's not Irish . Sounds like a black name . SYDNEY Actually , it 's Welsh . For " dark . " A dark beauty . Delia Spencer-Byrne . BRAD BYRNE So you just change her name without even asking me ? SYDNEY Caitlin means " pure " in the Irish tongue , Brad . BRAD BYRNE I know what the hell it means . What 's the matter ? You think she ca n't be pure because she 's not white ? SYDNEY Well , I --  BRAD BYRNE Right . SYDNEY Okay . You 're right . BRAD BYRNE We 're changing her name back to Caitlin . SYDNEY Delia Caitlin ? BRAD BYRNE What the hell does it matter ? I 've tried to make this shoe fit , but I 'm not sure if I was ever really at the ball . Maybe I was , but I sure as hell was n't dancing with you when my shoe fell off . SYDNEY I thought you were going to keep an open -- not to mention , sober -- mind . BRAD BYRNE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role of the gentleman even though I 'm nothing more than a pig-eyed mick ? And proud of it , mind you . p. 64 SYDNEY So this is a performance for you ? BRAD BYRNE I 've tried to reason with myself , Sydney . I 've tried to think of every other possibility other than an affair , but I keep coming to the same brick wall and it has " you are an idiot " spray-painted on it . In black . SYDNEY How long have you been performing , Brad ? Since I met you ? Or are you only acting when you hold the baby ? Or is it when you say it 's going to be all right : " I can do this , I can do this , I can . " Maybe , after all , you 're just the little engine that could n't . BRAD BYRNE Come on , Sydney . Surely you ca n't expect me to be happy about you inviting some strange black guy in our home ? SYDNEY Who just might be my cousin . BRAD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proving we 're related to President Jefferson through his black concubine ? Is n't it enough that we quite possibly are ? SYDNEY Brad , you 've had a lot to drink and our guests will be here momentarily . I need you to collect yourself BRAD BYRNE Why do you need him to know who you are ? You already know who you are and , if you do n't at your age , then you 'll never know . p. 65 SYDNEY I hope I never stop learning new things about who I am . The things I fear the most are the first things I have to confront . That 's the only way to grow and figure out where I belong . BRAD BYRNE You belong with me . SYDNEY Am I not with you ? BRAD BYRNE You have n't been with me since the night you bumped into that black ghost . And now you 've gone and found yourself a flesh-and-blood version . Life used to be so easy . SYDNEY I do n't remember that . ( A doorbell is heard . SYDNEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sydney , wait . Let 's just pretend we 're not here . Let them go . Let 's forget about who we are and just move forward from here -- just you , me , and the baby . SYDNEY I ca n't do that , Brad . It 's not good enough for Delia . You think she wo n't look in the mirror one day and see blonde , white mommy and brown daughter ; and wonder who she is ? I plan to have some answers . And no secrets . BRAD BYRNE I 've tried to take this leap of faith . I really have . But sometimes it just seems too high to jump . I thought I could , but when the emergency exploded into my life , I panicked . You ca n't breathe . You 're shocked at the inadequacy and cowardice of your reaction , but there 's nothing you can do . You sink in the quicksand of human idiocy . The grit fills your eyes and you die a certain kind of death ; one that , at the moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a choice , Brad . I do n't . ( The doorbell again . SYDNEY exists . BRAD downs his drink and pours another . JESSICA enters . ) BRAD BYRNE Yes , Jessica , I 'm drunk . From what I can sense about this morning 's proceedings , you 'd better start drinking , too . JESSICA SPENCER Hello , Brad . BRAD BYRNE Where 's my wife ? ( Enter SYDNEY with THEO who offers his hand to BRAD . ) THEO SCHUBERT Hello , Mr. Byrne . SYDNEY Brad , this is Theo Schubert . BRAD BYRNE ( shakes THEO 'S hand ) Hello , Dr. Schubert . I 've heard so much about you . Nice to make your acquaintance . THEO SCHUBERT The pleasure 's all mine , I 'm sure . BRAD BYRNE This is my mother-in-law , Jessica Spencer . Or perhaps you 've met ? THEO SCHUBERT Outside . JESSICA SPENCER We drove up at the same time . BRAD BYRNE I see . ( The doorbell chimes again . Its sound jars JESSICA . SYDNEY glances at her mother. ) p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exits . ) JESSICA SPENCER I did n't realize we were expecting someone else . BRAD BYRNE Yes , I 've been informed that one other visitor is coming . ( JESSICA looks as though she might leave . ) THEO SCHUBERT Going somewhere , Mrs. Spencer ? JESSICA SPENCER What ? No . I was just thinking that I did n't engage my car 's security system . THEO SCHUBERT This is a very safe neighborhood . Nothing here that should spook you . JESSICA SPENCER Of course . THEO SCHUBERT Of course . BRAD BYRNE Would you like that drink now , Jessica ? I have mimosas , Chardonnay , and Merlot . JESSICA SPENCER Yes , I 'll take that drink . BRAD BYRNE What about you , Dr. Schubert ? THEO SCHUBERT No thank you . I do n't drink . BRAD BYRNE Oh ? A teetotaler ? I hope you do n't mind if we partake of the vino so early on a Sunday morning . I do n't mean to insult your spiritual sensibility . Do you take communion in church or are you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with all that colorful hell-fire and damnation stuff . p. 68 THEO SCHUBERT I was raised Catholic . I do n't go to church anymore . BRAD BYRNE Oh I see . Nice suit . THEO SCHUBERT Thank you . BRAD BYRNE So you 're in private practice as a counselor ? THEO SCHUBERT Psychiatry . BRAD BYRNE Do tell . Well , you 've come to the right place . Should we take numbers or is it based on the greatest need , in which case it will be a fight to see who 's first . THEO SCHUBERT I do n't see patients on Sundays . BRAD BYRNE What a coincidence . I do n't negotiate lives on Sundays either , but duty is calling . And rather loudly . Competing with that tie of yours . THEO SCHUBERT Mr. Byrne , how can you possible see anything with your belly full of narcotics and so early on a Sunday morning ? I 'll ask you to back off and mind your manners  --  and I 'll ask you just once . BRAD BYRNE Yes sir . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other with extreme politeness which SYDNEY closely observes . ) GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Hello . p. 69 JESSICA SPENCER Hello . THEO SCHUBERT Hello , Mrs. Marquez . How have you been ? GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Delightful , thank you . How are you , Jessica ? JESSICA SPENCER Thank you . I 'm fine . And you ? GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Thank you for asking . I 'm fine . JESSICA SPENCER That 's good . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Yes . I 've led a fortunate life . BRAD BYRNE I 'm fine , too . I 'm also Brad , by the way . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Hello , Brad . Nice to see you again , Dr. Schubert . BRAD BYRNE Let me get this straight , Mrs. Marquez , you met my wife at a crosswalk , right ? GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ In a manner of speaking , yes . SYDNEY Brad , she just arrived . Let 's get everybody some tea or coffee before we start in with  --  BRAD BYRNE Lately , life seems to be full of opportunities for my wife . She met you ; and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black ghost . That 's what professors do , right , Sydney ? They profess. p. 70 JESSICA SPENCER Brad , do n't have another drink . ( BRAD takes another drink . ) BRAD BYRNE Only if you promise to have three , Jessica , because you 're eerily quiet . We voted the same ticket in the last five elections . Vote with me today because I 'm definitely outnumbered . SYDNEY Brad . BRAD BYRNE Lovely hat , Mrs. Marquez . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Thank you . BRAD BYRNE And your suit . I just ca n't get over it . Is it gabardine or linen , Theodore ? SYDNEY Brad , it 's Theo . I told you that . BRAD BYRNE Theo . It 's an impeccable suit . THEO SCHUBERT Thank you . Your Celtics jersey is equally as impeccable . BRAD BYRNE Much obliged . It 's so kind of you all to accept my wife 's invitation to brunch . We do n't often have strangers over and so early on a Sunday at that . Sunday 's my sleeping-in day ; being an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some might call such behavior blasphemous and warn me that God will punish me . But I look at my life today and know that I am blessed . No fears , no worries . Absolute peace . I 'll drink to that . ( and he does ) What 's for brunch anyway ? Brunch is like our baby . Breakfast plus lunch equals brunch . Black plus white equals what ? Blight ? Or wack ? Get it ? ( Silence and then : ) p. 71 SYDNEY We 're having quiche , Brad , and a tofu frittata for Theo and for me because we 're both vegan . BRAD BYRNE Both vegans , too ? My . And tofu frittata . Well , that proves it , does n't it ? Anybody who can eat that tasteless white stuff has to have some sick genetic link . Oh ! I 'd better be careful or Dr. Schubert might deconstructively declare that my reference to " tasteless white stuff " was nothing more than a self-deprecating remark . THEO SCHUBERT ( to BRAD ) I make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . On the contrary , I was thinking you must be uncomfortable given it 's a Sunday morning and you 're in a monkey suit while the rest of us are informally dressed . What are you all dressed up for ? My wife 's invitation was for a casual brunch . Do n't you understand the meaning of casual ? Or is this not casual ? Is what 's going on between you and my wife as far from casual as  --  JESSICA SPENCER Brad . THEO SCHUBERT I 'll tell you what is n't casual : your ten-cent innuendo . Inebriated or not , you need to check yourself , man . BRAD BYRNE " Check " myself ? You need to check yourself . This is my house . That 's my wife . This is my life and I do n't want it to change . Why are you here ? Because my wife is smart and gorgeous and way too tolerant ? Because you like watching white people squirm ? p. 72 SYDNEY Because I invited him . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Maybe I should go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blamed on me . JESSICA SPENCER Well , she might stay if you could stop looking at her like she conjured up this whole situation with her cauldron and eye of newt . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Thank you , Jessica . JESSICA SPENCER You 're welcome . BRAD BYRNE I 'm sorry . Mrs. Marquez ? I 'm so sorry . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ All apologies accepted . SYDNEY Please , Grace-Maria , stay . Maybe it 's a ridiculous notion , but I keep thinking that your presence makes Theo feel more comfortable . THEO SCHUBERT I have no reason to feel uncomfortable . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Oh ? Is that so ? My feeling is that you do because this situation calls your own blackness into question . SYDNEY Oh no . I did n't mean to do that . How did I do that ? THEO SCHUBERT You did n't . My blackness is just fine , thank you very much . In fact , it 's more than I thought it was . p. 73 GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ All right . THEO SCHUBERT It is n't my blackness that 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JESSICA SPENCER Dr. Schubert , you have the right to figure out your own life , but you do n't have the right to figure out mine or turn it upside down , do you understand ? THEO SCHUBERT But blackness has to be upheld . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Humanity has to be upheld . THEO SCHUBERT We have to uphold our blackness because nobody else will . Lots of people uphold whiteness ; you have Latinos , Jews , Asians who 'll worship it with no shame . But blackness ? No ma'am . So , when you 're black , you have to be real black . JESSICA SPENCER ( to THEO ) Goodness , do you have some armor . BRAD BYRNE Sir Schubert . JESSICA SPENCER Indeed . THEO SCHUBERT Sweet . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Yes indeed . I 'll bet you 're a man who puts his black card at the front of his wallet . THEO SCHUBERT With so many white people in the woodpile , I 'm liable to have my black card revoked. p. 74 SYDNEY You see , that 's the problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't admit each other into our circles . We see a white person  --  not Sydney Spencer ; and we see a black person  --  not Theo Schubert . These are the masks we put on each other , living in fear and awful hope that the human beings who emerge from behind them will not be lesser than us , but actually more . We can feel the contempt in this room , moving out of an unfamiliar patois of civilized rage and sifting through the pacifier of intelligence to keep us from killing each other . This country was never white . It was red and brown , colliding with whiteness with disastrous results . And then Anglos closing their ranks tighter and tighter : no Greeks , no Italians , no Mexicans , Germans , or Jews . And then they traipse off to Africa and steal blackness to misappropriate in a shrill and brutal way that has cost us a peaceful present . This country was never white and it will never be white . I am like my country : young and full of undeserved hubris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of civility , smart enough to know that change is inevitable , stupid enough to still prejudge . But circles are opening . Genetics . Mysteries . Throwbacks thrown forward . Some great desire to live with a least a modicum of honor . Something has to save us and I hope to goodness it 's in this room . Why , after all , are we here ? Perhaps coming together will allow us to see not what divides us , but what makes us the same . p. 75 JESSICA SPENCER But we are different . BRAD BYRNE You bet we are . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ But that does n't mean we have to lead with our differences . THEO SCHUBERT Mr. Byrne , to put your mind at ease , I am here primarily because intellectual curiosity provokes me . BRAD BYRNE Never heard it called that before . Let 's see . We 've had " Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner , " " Guess Who 's Coming to the Nursery , " and , now , " Guess Who 's Coming to Brunch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about some sobering coffee , Brad ? Mom , there 's some Tanzanian grind on the  --  BRAD BYRNE Tanzanian grind ? African coffee ? Congratulations on extending this new theme into every aspect of our lives , Sydney . JESSICA SPENCER I think we should eat . We 'll all feel better if we eat . THEO SCHUBERT Maybe so because what we have to share with you may make you and Brad lose your appetites altogether . BRAD BYRNE Fuck you . THEO SCHUBERT No thanks . Dance card 's full . SYDNEY Gentlemen . p. 76 GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Boys , boys . JESSICA SPENCER Indeed . SYDNEY Brad , Theo is here as my guest and if you ca n't be civilized to us , I suggest you take a walk . BRAD BYRNE You mean as in get out ? What is this " us " crap ? You and Theo are a team now ? SYDNEY Get a hold of yourself , Brad . Now . BRAD BYRNE Who 's got a hold of you , Sydney ? THEO SCHUBERT This has nothing to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your daughter . You know . The one whose skin you 're not so comfortable stroking anymore . BRAD BYRNE You told him about that ? It 's not the baby . It 's me . I just need SYDNEY Brad , I 've brought us all together because , with Theo 's help , I 've come to know myself better . Part of this includes Grace-Maria . Mother , please meet us halfway on this . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ I did n't mean to disturb you , Jessica . I just answered Dr. Schubert 's survey and in some way it all found its way back to you . I mentioned a long-lost sister , but  --  JESSICA SPENCER I am not lost . You 're the one who got lost . p. 77 GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ For your sake . SYDNEY She did n't want to make you uncomfortable , Mother . JESSICA SPENCER ( to GRACE-MARIA ) Do you think I 'm comfortable now ? ( to SYDNEY ) Do you ? BRAD BYRNE Wait a minute . So Grace-Maria 's your sister , Jessica ? Your biological sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was envious . ( SYDNEY slaps BRAD , and is immediately sorry for doing so ; but he slaps her back . THEO makes a move towards BRAD , but SYDNEY stops him . ) JESSICA SPENCER You see how easily and quickly it changes , Sydney ? The minute Brad knows , he talks about me as if a part of me vanished , as if I 'm smaller and less important and dismissible . BRAD BYRNE Forgive me if I 'm a little disturbed by the fact that my life  --  and my wife  --  are not what I thought they were . SYDNEY And just what did you think they were , Brad ? BRAD BYRNE Things were okay , were n't they ? We had very few problems . SYDNEY And now your life is over ? Poor Brad . Well , let me tell you something . A throwback is a very special thing . p. 78 BRAD BYRNE Throwback ? GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ Something thrown back from a long time ago . SYDNEY Her seeds can lie dormant in the gene pool for countless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And take note that I said seeds , plural , not seed . It 's like that girl in South Africa . Sandra Laing . Help me with the details , Theo . THEO SCHUBERT White people for generations and then she comes along getting darker by the week . SYDNEY She had to be reclassified from white to colored , which means mixed race in that part of the world . Did her mother have an affair ? No . Was it her mother 's family ? Her father 's ? Familiar questions for us . Listen well . Tell him , Theo . THEO SCHUBERT The seed of Africa has to be present in both parents for the throwback to pay a visit . BRAD BYRNE You Afro-centric liar . THEO SCHUBERT Genetic theory , my brother . BRAD BYRNE Do n't try that " my brother " bullshit with me like you 're related to me or something . We have nothing in common . Nothing . SYDNEY Brad , as long as you 're married to me , he is related to you . Calm down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy comes into my house and tries to tell me I 'm something other than what I know I am , what my heritage tells me I am . And what you are , too , Sydney . You know who you are . SYDNEY We only know what our history chooses to tell us we are . History , however , is revised in the moment it 's recorded . BRAD BYRNE So there 's no such thing as authenticity ? Is that what you 're professing , Professor ? SYDNEY There can be , but that does n't mean things ca n't exist without it . BRAD BYRNE Well , here 's something authentic for you : I 'm white . Not better than him or smarter or richer . Just white . THEO SCHUBERT Congratulations . GRACE-MARIA MARQUEZ It 's okay , Bradley . Of course you 're white . JESSICA SPENCER Of course , Brad . Although you tan nicely , too . BRAD BYRNE Stop patronizing me ! All of you . I 'm white . And I 'm not a racist . I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life with a certain reflection in the mirror and I ca n't go out the door with anything less in my briefcase . SYDNEY You only think you know who you are . I thought I did and then I became a mother . I saw a new me . And now I know that African blood courses through my veins . I 'm learning I do n't have less in my briefcase ; I have more . I mean , who the hell are you if all you care about is holding onto some myth of purity as if your life depended on it . Especially when you and I know the real issue here is the baby . Is n't that right , Mother ? p. 80 JESSICA SPENCER ( quietly ) yes . ( GRACE-MARIA walks over to JESSICA and tries to take her hand . JESSICA turns away from her . Just as GRACE-MARIA resigns herself to this , JESSICA reaches for her hand and they hold hands tightly , not looking at each other . Tears fall silently upon JESSICA 'S cheeks . ) SYDNEY Brad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delia Spencer Byrne  --  because she is n't exactly what you ordered . You blame her for changing your life and you have n't even given her a chance . She may be the best thing that 's ever happened to you . But you 'll never know because you 'll never be a real father to her , will you ? Even if you stayed , you 'd never really accept her or love her as your own . If you took her to a father-daughter banquet one day , you 'd never be comfortable . You 'd probably have some convenient excuse for not going at all . BRAD BYRNE I said I could do this . SYDNEY You lied . You know it and I know it . And , one day , she 'll know it . BRAD BYRNE You 've let this thing take over our lives like some virus . It 's changed the way you think , the way we are . It 's like you said : the moon has come crashing to earth and left a great big hole , only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of craters and sludge . No way it 's bouncing back into the sky . No way . p. 81 SYDNEY The only virus here is the virus of fear . I ca n't live my life in fear . BRAD BYRNE I do n't even know who you are anymore . SYDNEY I 'm Sydney Spencer . Neither white nor black , but both . Thirty-five . An American . A scholar . And , most of all , a mother . Who are you ? I mean , we know you 're white . You 've told us that a thousand times . But what do you have to say for the rest of you ? Take a walk , Brad . Collect yourself and  --  BRAD BYRNE " Collect yourself . " You Spencers always say that as if there 's little pieces of someone all over the place . SYDNEY And there are . And , when push comes to shove , some of us can collect all the pieces into a reasonable whole and some of us can not . BRAD BYRNE So is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shove pretty damn hard . SYDNEY I did n't shove , Brad . I shoved back . ( BRAD exits . Everybody looks at each other with discomfort as lights fade , cross-fading to ) p. 82 Act 2 , Scene 5 Scene Eleven ( a cloud of mist with the moon enormous and glowing .
