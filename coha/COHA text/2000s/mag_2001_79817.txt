It 's tough to portray a team with a 116-game winning streak as an underdog , but that was the curious position the football team from De La Salle High of Concord , Calif. , found itself in before its 29-15 victory over Long Beach ( Calif . ) Poly last Saturday night . The game marked the first meeting of No. 1 and No. 2 in the 19-year history of USA Today 's Super 25 rankings , and the Spartans were peeved about going into any game relegated to second . After all , De La Salle had gone undefeated throughout the Clinton presidency , and the last time it had lost  --  Dec. 4 , 1991  --  Tiger Woods was too young to hold a driver 's license , and rap 's most popular white guy was Vanilla Ice , not Eminem. // However , the Spartans had only three starters back on a defense that had held opponents to 40 points a year ago , and they were inexperienced at the skill positions . On paper they were no match for the Poly juggernaut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 39 ) than any other high school in the country , and since the start of the 1997 season they 'd gone 57-1-1 . This year 's squad is widely regarded as the most talented in school history , with six players listed in SuperPrep 's top 100. // So how to account for Poly 's humbling at the hands of the supposedly overmatched Spartans ? " They underestimated us , big time , " said De La Salle junior running back Maurice Drew , the star of the game with 165 total yards and four touchdowns . " I read the quotes in the paper , and it was like they had all these star players and we did n't have anybody . " In truth , the Spartans did not need this kind of external motivation . " The kids have been preparing for this game since January , " says Bob Ladouceur , who , in his 23rd season as the De La Salle coach , has a 253-14-1 record . // As both squads steamrollered toward their date with destiny , the hype reached a fever pitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game to organizations as diverse as ABC World News Tonight and NFL Films . A live telecast was available nationwide on DirecTV , and attendance at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach swelled to 17,321 . Scalpers were charging up to $50 for $10 tickets . // Poly , with an enrollment of 4,600 , is located on the mean streets of west LBC , immortalized in the gritty rhymes of native son Snoop Dogg . De La Salle , an all-boys Catholic school with an enrollment of 1,050 and a tuition of $7,800 , is situated in an upper-middle-class Bay Area suburb . Thus the game became shorthand for public versus private , city versus suburb , improvisational athleticism versus a rigid system . // Once the game began , though , easy stereotypes fell away . Poly played with discipline and cohesion , committing no turnovers and only three penalties . De La Salle displayed game-breaking speed and enough exuberance to earn a flag for excessive celebrating after Drew caught a screen pass , dashed 25 yards and somersaulted into the end zone on the first possession of the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rainbow that Drew hauled in at a pylon  --  only one in a series of perfect passes thrown by 6 ' 4 " senior quarterback Matt Gutierrez , who 's being recruited by Florida , Michigan and Notre Dame , among other colleges . The Jackrabbits nibbled away at the deficit , closing to 21-15 when their UCLA-bound tight end , 6 ' 7 " Marcedes Lewis , caught a 12-yard touchdown pass with 22 seconds left in the first half . // The Poly offensive line averages a meaty 6 ' 3 " and 267 pounds  --  about 35 pounds per man more than the De La Salle defensive front four . The Spartans dress only 49 players , and five start both ways , including 6 ' 4 " , 288-pound lineman Derek Landri , who 's bound for Notre Dame . To combat their mounting fatigue the Spartans went to their bench , and the story of the second half was the defensive effort of De La Salle 's scrubs . Twice in the third quarter the Spartans stopped Poly on downs , and they kept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the end zone even as he rushed for 161 yards . De La Salle 's Drew iced the game with a 22-yard touchdown gallop with 6:57 to go . // " It was an honor to share the field with them , " said Jackrabbits coach Raul Lara . " They embody discipline , teamwork and rock-solid fundamentals. " // All of the above can be traced to Ladouceur , a former probation officer who teaches religion at De La Salle . The Spartans begin and end every practice with a prayer . After last Saturday 's victory they no longer need to beseech the pollsters . De La Salle is No. 1 again , just where it belongs .
