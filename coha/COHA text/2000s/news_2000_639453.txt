<p> EDITOR 'S NOTE : As basketball coach for 16 seasons at Marquette , Ball State and Utah , 51-year-old Rick Majerus has compiled a 350-119 record . He was national coach of the year in 1989 ( Hoop Scoop ) , ' 91 ( UPI and Basketball Times ) , ' 92 ( Playboy ) and ' 98 ( John Wooden and Playboy ) . He has never had a losing season and has averaged 22 victories per season for his career . Now in his 11th year at Utah , Majerus has guided the Utes to 27 or more victories in each of the last five seasons - including a 30-4 mark and Final Four appearance in 1997-98 . Always outspoken , candid and forthright , Majerus sat down with The Denver Post 's Tom Kensler on Friday at his Salt Lake City residence - a hotel within walking distance from campus - and discussed a wide range of topics involving college basketball and his philosophy of life . <p> Post : What are your keys to success ? <p> Majerus : It all depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said many times , I really believe my legacy will be the academic success of my players . That 's what 's most important to me . <p> Post : Do some people have a hard time believing that the academic status of your team is more important to you than wins and losses ? <p> Majerus : My record speaks for itself . We just got our grades . We 've got eight players on the honor roll . All four of my seniors will graduate . Hanno ( Mottola ) will be my fourth academic All-American at Utah and probably my sixth as a coach . And I 'm probably most proud of Andre Miller getting his degree with a C average . I 'm not just saying that . I do n't have to go into any homes recruiting and pretend I 'm someone other than who I am . If you go on campus and ask anyone what 's the most important thing to Majerus , they 'd say academics . I 'd bet that in a heartbeat . And they also may say he likes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruit with academic potential in mind ? <p> Majerus : Yeah , but I 'll give a kid a chance . I was n't a real good student at Marquette . I 'm not the brightest guy . I was just an old C-plus plugger . I tell the guys , ' I do n't expect an A. I expect an A effort . ' I got a great education . My parents never graduated from high school . I really enjoy travel . I enjoy politics , movies , the theater . I think all of that is because of my education . <p> Post : What , then , do you look for in a player ? <p> Majerus : No. 1 is that a kid wants to get an education , or someone wants him to get an education - parental support is everything . Then it would be having passion for the game , and third would be usually having a skill that I can plug into the framework of the team . <p> We 're not going to be able to go out and get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Utah . He 's either going to the schools that select players - North Carolina , Kentucky , Duke , Arizona - or he 's going to stay home . We 're not going to get those players . <p> So I try to find somebody who wants to play at the University of Utah for my team , with my players . When I recruit them , I tell them , ' You 're going to work really hard , harder than you can imagine , and your academics are going to be the most important priority . ' And I have very stringent rules . I tell them that one time they 're tested positive for drugs , they 're off the team for the remainder of the year . There 's no compromise . Second time , they 're off the team for good . We have a four-failures policy at the university ; I have my own policy . <p> Post : Do you frighten off some potential recruits ? <p> Majerus : Oh , yeah , a lot . A helluva lot . <p> Post : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's always an evolution . They 're more worldly . They almost all fall into one of two categories : kids from fragmented families whose parents may not love them enough or are disenfranchised , or kids from homes where they 're loved too much . The worst thing you can do is not love your kid enough . The second-worst thing is to try to take all the pain and hurt and failure out of his life . Failure is your friend . I tell my players , if they want to have a lot of success , they need to have a lot of failure . Parents who dissolve kids of that are doing them a great disservice . <p> Post : Have you thought about coaching somewhere else ? <p> Majerus : I 've told people I wo n't end my career here . Maybe I will . I 'd like to make another move or two . I think change is good for you . I 've said that , and a lot of people ca n't handle how direct I am . If I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , by golly , I 'm happy here ; bury me in these mountains . ' <p> That does n't necessarily mean I 'm going to leave right away . I think about going pro . I love practice , so coaching pro would n't be a good thing for a guy who loved practice . I love evaluating talent , and in pro ball you do n't do that . The biggest asset to pro ball is also it 's biggest detriment - you become one-dimensional . I like the intellectual atmosphere of a campus . I enjoy a lot of the professors and the university president here . And yet , the sound of coaching pro ball is somewhat enticing . Right now I 'm happy here . I have a great quality of life here . <p> Post : How has the game changed ? <p> Majerus : It 's faster . It 's more offense-oriented , and I 've always been an advocate of defense . I was a bad walk-on at Marquette and found a niche playing defense . <p> Post : Has that been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change . I 'm a strong advocate against the death penalty . I was in a protest or two and I remember somebody told me , ' You 're not going to change the world . ' I told him I just did n't want the world to change me . <p> Post : How has the loss of young players to the NBA hurt college basketball ? <p> Majerus : It hurts the player more . In some ways , it 's making a deal with the devil . Yeah , you 've got the money , notoriety , security . But you 've given up a part of your youth . You 've given up being part of a team . You 've given up the fact that your mind can become more facile , that you can become a more broad-based person . Yeah , you have a nice house and a nice ride . But how much money do you need ? How many boats can you water-ski behind ? <p> Post : If you were king of college basketball , what would you change ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an academic agenda that culminates into graduation . Maybe you could only give out as many scholarships as kids who graduate , something like that . <p> Post : Would you pay players with , perhaps , a monthly stipend for expenses ? <p> Majerus : Maybe I 'd allocate a small stipend for travel , but that 's a moot point , anyway . You 're never going to be able to do it with women and other sports . It 's a nice thing to bring up and provoke discussion . But it will never happen . There 's no money to do it . <p> Post : More policing of recruiting practices ? <p> Majerus : It 's like taxes - we 're all about as honest as we can afford to be . You could add more rules . But I think we 're about at where we need to be . They 're talking about having one big combine for recruiting . Well , all of a sudden , ( Keith ) Van Horn and ( Michael ) Doleac and a lot of my players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players about four times , about the fourth time the light 's going to go on . I think that would be detrimental to schools like Utah . <p> Post : When you see a coach break the rules , do you feel like blowing the whistle ? <p> Majerus : I do n't get into the judgmental aspect of that . My thing is , you deal with yourself . <p> Post : Would you change the use of college board scores for entrance requirements ? <p> Majerus : I think Prop 48 or Prop 16 or Prop whatever it is , is racially skewed from this standpoint : Who are recipients of America 's worst education ? The inner-city kids . And who resides in the inner city ? The blacks , Hispanics , the Latinos , Mexicans . The inner city has a lack of opportunity , from funding for educational endeavors , to libraries , to parental involvement . So you 're put behind the eight-ball when you 're an Andre Miller . He got 690 twice on his SAT and needed 700 to play his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get over the loss in the ' 98 Final Four ? <p> Majerus : Yeah , because I realized the likelihood of my every getting there at the University of Utah is infinitesimal . It was special to get there . I felt sorry for myself . I pouted . I went off to Hawaii . I felt better when I looked at the film . Then I realized there was nothing more they could have done or I could have done . It was n't anybody 's fault . It was Kentucky 's fault . They were too good . @p#
