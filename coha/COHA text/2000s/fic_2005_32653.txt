How We Are Hungry By Dave Eggers Random House Dave Eggers Another I 'd gone to Egypt , as a courier , easy . I gave the package to a guy at the airport and was finished and free by noon on the first day . It was a bad time to be in Cairo , unwise at that juncture , with the poor state of relations between our nation and the entire region , but I did it anyway because , at that point in my life , if there was a window at all , however small and discouraged , I would-I 'd been having trouble thinking , finishing things . Words like anxiety and depression seemed apt then , in that I was n't interested in the things I was usually interested in , and could n't finish a glass of milk without deliberation . But I did n't stop to ruminate or wallow . Diagnosis would have made it all less interesting . I 'd been a married man , twice ; I 'd been a man who turned forty among friends ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people working for me . Years after all that , somewhere in May , I found myself in Egypt , against the advice of my government , with mild diarrhea and alone . There was a new heat there , dry and suffocating and unfamiliar to me . I 'd lived only in humid places - Cincinnati , Hartford - where the people I knew felt sorry for each other . Surviving in the Egyptian heat was invigorating , though-living under that sun made me lighter and stronger , made of platinum . I 'd dropped ten pounds in a few days but I felt good . This was a few weeks after some terrorists had slaughtered seventy tourists at Luxor , and everyone was jittery . And I 'd just been in New York , on the top of the Empire State Building , a few days after a guy opened fire there , killing one . I was n't consciously following trouble around , but then what the hell was I doing-On a Tuesday I was by the pyramids , walking , loving the dust , squinting ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hawkers who work the Gizeh plateau - really some of the least charming charmers the world owns - were trying to sell me anything - little scarab toys , Cheops keychains , plastic sandals . They spoke twenty words of a dozen languages , and tried me with German , Spanish , Italian , English . I said no , feigned muteness , got in the habit of just saying " Finland ! " to them all , sure that they did n't know any Finnish , until a man offered me a horseback ride , in American English , hooking his r 's obscenely . They really were clever bastards . I 'd already gotten a brief and expensive camel ride , which was worthless , and though I 'd never ridden a horse past an amble and had n't really wanted to , I followed him on foot . " Through the desert , " he said , leading me past a silver tourist bus , Swiss seniors unloading . I followed him . " We go get horse . We ride to the Red Pyramid , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , " he said , answering my last unspoken question . I knew the Red Pyramid had just been reopened , or was about to be reopened , though I did n't know why they called it Red . I wanted to ride on a horse through the desert . I wanted to see if this man - slight , with brown teeth , wide-set eyes , a cop mustache - would try to kill me . There were plenty of Egyptians who would love to kill me , I was sure , and I was ready to engage in any way with someone who wanted me dead . I was alone and reckless and both passive and quick to fury . It was a beautiful time , everything electric and hideous . In Egypt I was noticed , I was yelled at by some and embraced by others . One day I was given free sugarcane juice by a well-dressed man who lived under a bridge and wanted to teach at an American boarding school . I could n't help him but he was sure I could , talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in crowded Cairo , while others eyed me vacantly . I was a star , a heathen , an enemy , a nothing . At Gizeh I walked with the horse man - he had no smell - away from the tourists and buses , and down from the plateau . The hard sand went soft . We passed an ancient man in a cave below ground , and I was told to pay him baksheesh , a tip , because he was a " famous man " and the keeper of that cave . I gave him a dollar . The first man and I continued walking , for about a mile , and where the desert met a road he introduced me to his partner , a fat man , bursting from a threadbare shirt , who had two horses , both black , Arabian . They helped me on the smaller of the two . The animal was alive everywhere , restless , its hair marshy with sweat . I did n't tell them that I 'd only ridden once before , and that time at a roadside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-drunk . I was trying to find dinosaur bones in Arizona - I thought , briefly , that I was an archeologist . I still do n't know why I was made the way I am . " Hesham , " the horse man said , and jerked his thumb at his sternum . I nodded . I got on the small black horse and we left the fat man . Hesham and I trotted about five miles on the rural road , newly paved , passing farms while cabs shot past us , honking . Always the honking in Cairo ! - the drivers steering with the left hand to be better able , with their right , to communicate every nuance of their feelings . My saddle was simple and small ; I spent a good minute trying to figure out how it was attached to the horse and how I would be attached to it . Under it I could feel every bone and muscle and band of cartilage that bound the horse together . I stroked its neck apologetically and it shook my hand away . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed a narrow gorge , the desert spread out in front of us without end . I felt like a bastard for ever doubting that it was so grand and acquiescent . It looked like a shame to step on it , it was shaped so carefully , layer upon layer of velveteen . On the horse 's first steps onto sand , Hesham said : " Yes ? " And I nodded . With that he whipped my horse and bellowed to his own and we were at a gallop , in the Sahara , heading up a dune the size of a four-story building . I 'd never galloped before . I had no idea how to ride . My horse was flying ; he seemed to like it . The last horse I 'd been on had bitten me constantly . This one just thrust his head rhythmically at the future . I slid to the back of the saddle and pulled myself forward again . I balled the reins into my hand and leaned down , getting closer to the animal 's body . But something or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle . It was the most violence I 'd experienced in years . Hesham , seeing me struggle , slowed down . I was thankful . The world went quiet . I regained my grip on the reins , repositioned myself on the saddle , and leaned forward . I patted the horse 's neck and narrowly missed his teeth , which were now attempting to eat my fingers . I felt ready again . I would know more now . The start had been chaos because it was so sudden . " Yes ? " Hesham said . I nodded . He struck my horse savagely and we bolted . We made it over the first dune and the view was a conqueror 's , oceans upon oceans , a million beveled edges . We flew down the dune and up the next . The horse did n't slow and the saddle was punishing my spine . Holy Christ it hurt . I was n't in sync with the horse - I tried but neither the fat man nor the odorless one I was following had given me any direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with terrible rhythm , and soon the pain was searing , molten . I was again and again being dropped on my ass , on marble , from a hundred feet-I could barely speak enough to tell Hesham to slow down , to stop , to rest my spine . Something was being irrevocably damaged , I was sure . But there was no way to rest . I could n't get a word out . I struggled for air , I tried to ride higher in the saddle , but could n't stop because I had to show Hesham I was sturdy , unshrinking . He was glancing back at me periodically and when he did I squinted and smiled in the hardest way I could . Soon he slowed again . We trotted for a few minutes as much air as I could . " Yes ? " Hesham said . I nodded . And he struck my horse again and we galloped . The pain resumed , with more volume , subtleties , tendrils reaching into new and unknown places - shooting through to my clavicles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the torment and would have studied it , enjoyed it in a way , but its sudden stabbing prevented me from drawing the necessary distance from it . I needed to prove to this Egyptian lunatic that I could ride with him . That we were equal out here , that I could keep up and devour it , the agony . That I could be punished , that I expected the punishment and could withstand it , however long he wanted to give it to me . We could ride together across the Sahara even though we hated each other for a hundred good and untenable reasons . I was part of a continuum that went back thousands of years , nothing having changed . It almost made me laugh , so I rode as anyone might have ridden at any point in history , meaning that it was only him and me and the sand and a horse and saddle - I had nothing with me at all , was wearing a white button-down shirt and shorts and sandals-and Jesus , however disgusting we were , however wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I was watching . As the horse 's hooves scratched the sand and the horse breathed and I breathed , as the mane whipped over my hands and the sand sprayed over my legs , spitting on my bare ankles , I was watching how the man moved with the horse . Somewhere , after twenty minutes more of continuous pounding , with the horse at full gallop , I learned . I had been letting the horse strike me , was trying to sit above the saddle , hoping my distance from it would diminish the impact each time , but there were ways to eliminate the pain altogether . I learned . I moved with the horse and when I finally started moving with that damned horse , nodding forward , in agreement , in collusion , the pain was gone . I was riding that stupid and divine horse , attached to it , low , my head immersed in its mane , and I-Hesham noticed I no longer struggled and we rode faster . We rode with the sun overhead . There was a wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every army the world had ever burdened . I loved the man I followed in the way you love only those you 've wanted to kill . And when I was most full of love the pyramid emerged from the sand , a less perfect peak among the dunes . At the Red Pyramid we went up its side , lifting ourselves onto each step , each great square stone almost five feet tall . At the entrance , fifty feet up , the man gestured me into a small black entranceway into the chamber at the pyramid 's center . I followed him down and in , the passage steep , narrow , dark , dank , too small for anyone larger than ourselves . There was a rope that could be used to guide us to the bottom . I held it and descended ; there were no steps . The smell was chalky and the air thick and difficult to draw . Ahead of me the man held a torch which carved a jagged light from the darkness . At the bottom of the decline , we stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon ducked through a doorway and were inside a stone box . It was a completely unadorned room , with high ceilings and perfect geometry . Hesham waved his arms around the room with great proud flourishes . " Home of king , " Hesham said , bringing his torch to one side of the room and revealing a long stone box , the tomb . The chamber was otherwise empty , devoid of any markings or jewels or masonry . Chambers like these had been raided endlessly over the centuries , and now all that remained was bare walls , smooth , with no sign of-The air inside was heaving with dust and I felt we would die if we stayed long . Would he try to kill me ? Rob me ? We were alone . For no reason at all I was without worry . We stared at each other in the room , neither of us truly impressed by the box we were in , though we both momentarily pretended at awe . I was disappointed , though I knew not to expect much inside these rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , but there was no evidence that it was ever anything but this , this sandy cube , and the fact of it saddened me . The exterior so magnificent , the core so crude . Hesham held the torch near his face and looked at me , though in the weak light I 'm not sure he saw me at all . He sighed loudly . His face moved through emotions : arrogance , boredom , annoyance . He was obligated to stay as long as I wanted to stay . I did n't want to stay at all , but I liked seeing him suffer , if even a small amount . We climbed the steps again toward the crooked window of light where the pyramid drank the sky . It was dusk . Once outside and on the ground again , the man said , " There is another . " I asked him its name . He said it was called the Bent Pyramid . We were on our horses again . " Yes ? " he asked . I nodded and he struck my horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was soon only a black wraith against a silver sky . Our horses were angry and breathed in hydraulic bursts . I realized now that Hesham was not doing this for whatever money I would give him . He had n't bothered to negotiate for any of the trips after the Red Pyramid . What we were doing was something else , and each of us knew it . I was now sure he would n't kill me , and knew he had no plan , none more than I had . An hour later we were at the Bent Pyramid , this one larger but less secure , and the light was gone . We climbed to its entrance and descended and once again found ourselves inside a sacred chamber , a room that had held a queen or pharaoh , though again the room was bare . The man and I stared at each other , breathing in the hard thick air , without any compassion for each other or anything .                  @ @ @
