Bill Clinton has always had a problem with time . There he was in April , standing in a grove of 3,000-year-old giant sequoias in central California , about to declare them a national monument as part of his green legacy . But the Secret Service told him he had only 10 minutes for a " hike in the woods . " Clinton bounded off through the sequoias , fascinated by the 300-ft. skyscrapers that spring from a seed smaller than a rice grain . He returned , behind schedule , to make his designation speech before zipping off by helicopter to a fund raiser in southern California . <P> Nature operates on a less hurried time scale . Some of the sequoias Clinton preserved in the 328,000-acre monument are only the third generation since the last Ice Age , part of a family of trees that has endured fires , earthquakes , storms and every change of political leadership since human history began . " I am not a tree hugger , but these sequoias evoke an almost religious feeling in me , " says Joe Fontaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaigned for 40 years to stop logging near the sequoias . Sequoias themselves are too brittle for timber yards , but if trees all around them are logged , their shallow roots often fail to hold them in the ground . " People look at their own lifetime , with a beginning and an end , but restoring a forest takes longer , " says Fontaine . <P> As time runs out for his presidency , Clinton is desperate to leave an environmental legacy that will not be swept away like last year 's leaves . Just last week he decreed the preservation of 84 million acres of coral reefs in Hawaii , his EPA ordered the long-delayed dredging of chemical waste from the Hudson River , and he started a new effort to salvage the Kyoto treaty to fight global warming after negotiations broke down in the Hague last month . With a flurry of pronouncements this year , he has locked away from loggers and developers more public land in the lower 48 states than any other President . But why , his friends ask and his foes accuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of his term ? Why is he cramming in so much now , when he did so little before ? <P> " In the second term of a presidency , you ought to be thinking about your legacy before the last six months , " says Denis Hayes , chairman of Earth Day 2000 . Clinton may have some regrets . " There is much more to be done in the years ahead , " he said last week at the National Geographic Society , when announcing the Hawaii preserve . " Many , many important ecosystems are disappearing just as we begin to grasp their unique significance . " <P> Clinton 's environmental record , like his overall place in presidential history , is muddled . It can be argued that he has done more for nature than any other President since Theodore Roosevelt , but he has also missed opportunities that may never present themselves again , given the irreversibility of much of the damage being done to the planet . " Clinton fell short by the needs of this century , but by the standards of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl Pope , executive director of the Sierra Club .
