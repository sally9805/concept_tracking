Small Wonders Headnote Why it 's worth it to say yes when your child wants to pitch in BY JOANNE KAUFMAN // THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF PHRASES guaranteed to fill your average adult with fear and trembling . " Hello , this is the IRS " immediately springs to mind . But nothing quite equals " Mommy or Daddy , can I help ? " Since Karen and Matthew were toddlers and first began to declare independence , I 've wanted them to view themselves as competent , contributing members of the family . But I quickly found that it 's a lot of work to groom them for the domestic workforce . I 've said more last rites over waffle batter than I care to contemplate , remopped more floors , and remade more beds ( maybe it is n't common knowledge that you should remove all books and American Girl dolls , to say nothing of Ritz Bits , before you attempt to slip on a fitted sheet ) . For each egg that hits its mark in the mixing bowl , at least two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm torn between two desires : to just do the task myself and to give them a chance to learn . Ever since Matthew could hold himself up , he 's wanted to hold up his end around the house . An early favorite toy was a Fisher-Price " vacuum , " but by the time he was 5 , he 'd taken on the role of Mr. Fix-It . Like a quack doggedly insistent on practicing medicine , he 's " fixed " our answering machine , fax machine , and printer to the point that their only practical use is as landfill . Most parents say they can ascertain their kids ' whereabouts by following the trail left by pebbly bits of Play-Doh , Lego pieces , and Barbie shoes . With Matthew , I followed the screwdrivers , wrenches , and pliers . Karen 's early favorite job was cleaning the panes of our French door ; what she really wanted was the chance to operate a spray bottle of vinegar and water . But it 's the combination of the two children that 's particularly intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team was washing the car . It was a morning in early summer . She was 3 , he was 5 . The sun was bright , the sky was a sharp blue , the windows of the Honda were wide open . What stuns me most , though , is my persistent gullibility . One morning , I was preparing for a big holiday dinner by polishing the sterling silverware . Matthew , then 6 , volunteered his assistance . " And Mommy , since we 're doing the silverware , should n't we do the silver tea service too ? " he asked . " Otherwise , it 's going to look pretty dirty by comparison . " Overcome by either the chemical fumes or holiday cheer , I agreed , carrying the heavy , ornate sugar bowl , creamer , and coffee- and teapots to the kitchen and adding them to the clutter on the counter . Not ten minutes later , Matthew and Karen , who 'd joined the polishing bee , looked up in dismay . " This is really hard , " they said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then laid down their rags and bolted to watch a Scooby  --  Doo marathon . And since they had already generously dabbed the tea service with polish , I had no choice but to complete a job I had n't intended to take on in the first place . That 's the main problem : They rarely want to help in the way I need them to help-say , by folding the napkins or filling the cooler with ice and soft drinks for a barbecue . They want either a job that 's already been filled or one for which they have yet to demonstrate significant aptitude . Take , for instance , the garden hose , which in my kids ' hands hits the nice man from FedEx with admirable consistency and only coincidentally grazes the flower beds . And yet , I am coming to realize that a willingness to let my children try to pitch in , to help them help will , finally , make them genuinely helpful . One Saturday this past winter , when we were expecting half a dozen guests for dinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribs , which made him not only extremely uncomfortable but also useless for the rest of the day . Except for stocking the refrigerator a bit too heavily in favor of root beer , Karen and Matthew stepped splendidly into the breach , clearing their toys out of the living room , vacuuming the rug , dishing out the chips and guacamole , and setting the table . " Karen , " I heard my son say . " See how the blade of the knife has a side that 's a little sharp ? That 's the part that points in toward the plate . " I glanced at the table . Were all the yolks spattered on the floor worth this ? I looked at the table again , the places set carefully by four little hands . Worth it . Definitely worth it .
