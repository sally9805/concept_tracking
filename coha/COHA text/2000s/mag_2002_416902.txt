There are many ways terrorists can kill you  --  computers are n't one of them . <p> AGAIN AND AGAIN SINCE SEPTEMBER 11 , President Bush , Vice President Cheney , and senior administration officials have alerted the public not only to the dangers of chemical , biological , and nuclear weapons but also to the further menace of cyberterrorism . " Terrorists can sit at one computer connected to one network and can create worldwide havoc , " warned Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge in a representative observation last April . " They do n't necessarily need a bomb or explosives to cripple a sector of the economy , or shut down a power grid . " <p> Even before September 11 , Bush was fervently depicting an America imminently in danger of an attack by cyberterrorists , warning during his presidential campaign that " American forces are overused and underfunded precisely when they are confronted by a host of new threats and challenges  --  the spread of weapons of mass destruction , the rise of cyberterrorism , the proliferation of missile technology . " In other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specter of terrorism , but by a menacing new breed of it that is technologically advanced , little understood , and difficult to defend against . Since September 11 , these concerns have only multiplied . A survey of 725 cities conducted by the National League of Cities for the anniversary of the attacks shows that cyberterrorism ranks with biological and chemical weapons atop officials ' lists of fears . <p> Concern over cyberterrorism is particularly acute in Washington . As is often the case with a new threat , an entire industry has arisen to grapple with its ramifications  --  think tanks have launched new projects and issued white papers , experts have testified to its dangers before Congress , private companies have hastily deployed security consultants and software designed to protect public and private targets , and the media have trumpeted the threat with such front-page headlines as this one , in The Washington Post last June : " Cyber-Attacks by Al Qaeda Feared , Terrorists at Threshold of Using Internet as Tool of Bloodshed , Experts Say . " <p> The federal government has requested $4.5 billion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,000 " cyber investigators " ; President Bush and Vice President Cheney keep the issue before the public ; and in response to September 11 , Bush created the office of " cybersecurity czar " in the White House , naming to this position Richard Clarke , who has done more than anyone to raise awareness , including warning that " if an attack comes today with information warfare ... it would be much , much worse than Pearl Harbor . " <p> It 's no surprise , then , that cyberterrorism now ranks alongside other weapons of mass destruction in the public consciousness . Americans have had a latent fear of catastrophic computer attack ever since a teenage Matthew Broderick hacked into the Pentagon 's nuclear weapons system and nearly launched World War III in the 1983 movie WarGames . Judging by official alarums and newspaper headlines , such scenarios are all the more likely in today 's wired world . <p> There 's just one problem : There is no such thing as cyberterrorism  --  no instance of anyone ever having been killed by a terrorist ( or anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that al Qaeda or any other terrorist organization has resorted to computers for any sort of serious destructive activity . What 's more , outside of a Tom Clancy novel , computer security specialists believe it is virtually impossible to use the Internet to inflict death on a large scale , and many scoff at the notion that terrorists would bother trying . " I do n't lie awake at night worrying about cyberattacks ruining my life , " says Dorothy Denning , a computer science professor at Georgetown University and one of the country 's foremost cybersecurity experts . " Not only does cyberterrorism not rank alongside chemical , biological , or nuclear weapons , but it is not anywhere near as serious as other potential physical threats like car bombs or suicide bombers . " <p> Which is not to say that cybersecurity is n't a serious problem  --  it 's just not one that involves terrorists . Interviews with terrorism and computer security experts , and current and former government and military officials , yielded near unanimous agreement that the real danger is from the criminals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global economy last year using viruses , worms , and other readily available tools . That figure is sure to balloon if more is n't done to protect vulnerable computer systems , the vast majority of which are in the private sector . Yet when it comes to imposing the tough measures on business necessary to protect against the real cyberthreats , the Bush administration has balked . Crushing BlackBerrys <p> When ordinary people imagine cyberterrorism , they tend to think along Hollywood plot lines , doomsday scenarios in which terrorists hijack nuclear weapons , airliners , or military computers from halfway around the world . Given the colorful history of federal boondoggles  --  billion-dollar weapons systems that misfire , $600 toilet seats  --  that 's an understandable concern . But , with few exceptions , it 's not one that applies to preparedness for a cyberattack . " The government is miles ahead of the private sector when it comes to cybersecurity , " says Michael Cheek , director of intelligence for iDefense , a Virginia-based computer security company with government and private-sector clients . " Particularly the most sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune have combined to bring this about . Take nuclear weapons . The biggest fallacy about their vulnerability , promoted in action thrillers like WarGames , is that they 're designed for remote operation . " The movie is premised on the assumption that there 's a modern bank hanging on the side of the computer that controls the missiles , " says Martin Libicki , a defense analyst at the RAND Corporation . " I assure you , there is n't " Rather , nuclear weapons and other sensitive military systems enjoy the most basic form of Internet security : they 're " air-gapped , " meaning that they 're not physically connected to the Internet and are therefore inaccessible to outside hackers . ( Nuclear weapons also contain " permissive action links , " mechanisms to prevent weapons from being armed without inputting codes carried by the president . ) A retired military official was somewhat indignant at the mere suggestion : " As a general principle , we 've been looking at this thing for 20 years . What cave have you been living in if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cyberthreats , the Defense Department has been particularly vigilant to protect key systems by isolating them from the Net and even from the Pentagon 's internal network . All new software must be submitted to the National Security Agency for security testing . " Terrorists could not gain control of our spacecraft , nuclear weapons , or any other type of high-consequence asset , " says Air Force Chief Information Officer John Gilligan . For more than a year , Pentagon CIO John Stenbit has enforced a moratorium on new wireless networks , which are often easy to hack into , as well as common wireless devices such as PDAs , Black-Berrys , and even wireless or infrared copiers and faxes . <p> The September 11 hijackings led to an outcry that airliners are particularly susceptible to cyberterrorism . Earlier this year , for instance , Sen. Charles Schumer ( D-NY ) described " the absolute havoc and devastation that would result if cyberterrorists suddenly shut down our air traffic control system , with thousands of planes in mid-flight . " In fact , cybersecurity experts give some of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative and air traffic control systems and strictly air-gaps the latter And there 's a reason the 9/11 hijackers used box-cutters instead of keyboards : It 's impossible to hijack a plane remotely , which eliminates the possibility of a high-tech 9/11 scenario in which planes are used as weapons . <p> Another source of concern is terrorist infiltration of our intelligence agencies . But here , too , the risk is slim . The CIA 's classified computers are also air-gapped , as is the FBI 's entire computer system . " They 've been paranoid about this forever , " says Libicki , adding that paranoia is a sound governing principle when it comes to cybersecurity . Such concerns are manifesting themselves in broader policy terms as well . One notable characteristic of last year 's Quadrennial Defense Review was how strongly it focused on protecting ' information systems . <p> But certain tics in the way government agencies procure technology have also  --  entirely by accident  --  helped to keep them largely free of hackers . For years , agencies eschewed off-the-shelf products and insisted instead on developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particularly savvy form of bureaucratic self-preservation . When , say , the Department of Agriculture succeeded in convincing Congress that it needed a specially designed system , both the agency and the contractor benefited . The software company was assured the agency 's long-term business , which became dependent on its product ; in turn , bureaucrats developed an expertise with the software that made them difficult to replace . This , of course , fostered colossal inefficiencies  --  agencies often could n't communicate with each other , minor companies developed fiefdoms in certain agencies , and if a purveyor went bankrupt , the agency was left with no one to manage its technology . But it did provide a peculiar sort of protection : Outside a select few , no one understood these specific systems well enough to violate them . So in a sense , the famous inability of agencies like the FBI and INS to share information because of incompatible computer systems has yielded the inadvertent benefit of shielding them from attack . Ankle Biters <p> That leaves the less-protected secondary targets  --  power grids , oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present opportunities as nightmarish as do nuclear weapons , but nonetheless seem capable , under the wrong hands , of causing their own mass destruction . Because most of these systems are in the private sector and are not yet regarded as national security loopholes , they tend to be less secure than government and military systems . In addition , companies increasingly use tine Internet to manage such processes as oil-pipeline flow and water levels in dams by means of " supervisory control and data acquisition " systems , or SCADA , which confers remote access . Most experts see possible vulnerability here , and though terrorists have never attempted to exploit it , media accounts often sensationalize the likelihood that they will . <p> To illustrate the supposed ease with which our enemies could subvert a dam , The Washington Post 's June story on al Qaeda cyberterrorism related an anecdote about a 12-year-old who hacked into the SCADA system at Arizona 's Theodore Roosevelt Dam in 1998 , and was , the article intimated , within mere keystrokes of unleashing millions of gallons of water upon helpless downstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CNet.com revealed the tale to he largely apocryphal  --  the incident occurred in 1994 , the hacker was 27 , and , most importantly , investigators concluded that he could n't have gained control of tine dam and that no lives or property were ever at risk . <p> Most hackers break in simply for sport . To the extent that these hacks occur , they 're mainly Web site defacements , which are a nuisance , but leave the intruder no closer to exploiting the system in any deadly way . Security experts dismiss such hackers as " ankle biters " and roll their eyes at prognostications of doom . <p> Of course , it 's conceivable that a computer-literate terrorist truly intent on wreaking havoc could hack into computers at a tiara or power company . But once inside , it would be far more difficult for him to cause significant damage than most people realize . " It 's not the difficulty of doing it , " says RAND 's Libicki . " It 's the difficulty of doing it and having any real consequence " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these apocalyptic scenarios , " says George Smith , the editor of Crypt Newsletter , which covers computer security issues . " You always just get the assumption that chemical plants can be made to explode , that the water supply can be polluted  --  things that are even hard to do physically are suddenly assumed to be elementary because of the prominence of the Internet . " <p> Few besides a company 's own employees possess the specific technical know-how required to run a specialized SCADA system . The most commonly cited example of SCADA exploitation bears this out . Two years ago , an Australian man used an Internet connection to release a million gallons of raw sewage along Queensland 's Sunshine Coast after being turned down for a government job . When police arrested him , they discovered that he 'd worked for the company that designed the sewage treatment plant 's control software . This is true of most serious cybersecurity breaches  --  they tend to come from insiders . I was Robert Hanssen 's familiarity with the FBI 's computer system that allowed him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perpetrators were n't terrorists but rogue employees with specialized knowledge difficult , if not impossible , for outsiders to acquire  --  a security concern , but not one attributable to cyberterrorism . <p> Terrorists might , in theory , try to recruit insiders . But even if they succeeded , the degree of damage they could cause would still be limited . Most worst-case scenarios ( particularly those put forth by government ) presuppose that no human beings are keeping watch to intervene if something goes wrong . But especially in the case of electrical power grids , oil and gas utilities , and communications companies , this is simply untrue . Such systems get hit all the time by hurricanes , floods , or tornadoes , and company employees are well rehearsed in handling the fallout . This is equally true when the trouble stems from human action . Two years ago in California , energy companies like Enron and El Paso Corp . conspired to cause power shortages that led to brownouts and blackouts  --  the same effects cyberterrorists would wreak . As Smith points out , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of the blackouts . No one lost their mind " The State suffered only minor ( if demoralizing ) inconvenience . <p> But perhaps the best indicator of what is realistic came last July when the U.S. Naval War College contracted with a research group to simulate a massive attack on the nation 's information infrastructure . Government hackers and security analysts gathered in Newport , R.I. , for a war game dubbed " Digital Pearl Harbor . " The result ? The hackers failed to crash the Internet , though they did cause serious sporadic damage . But , according to a CNet.com report , officials concluded that terrorists hoping to stage such an attack " would require a syndicate with significant resources , including $200 million , country-level intelligence and five years of preparation time . " Hack Attack <p> Despite all the media alarm about terrorists poised on the verge of cyberattack , intelligence suggests that they 're doing no more than emailing and surfing for potential targets . When U.S. troops recovered al Qaeda laptops in Afghanistan , officials were surprised to find its members more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineering software , electronic models of a dam , and information on computerized water systems , nuclear power plants , and U.S. and European stadiums . But nothing suggested they were planning cyberattacks , only that they were using the Internet to communicate and coordinate physical attacks . " There does n't seem to be any evidence that the people we know as terrorists like to do cyberterrorism , " says Libicki . Indeed , in a July report to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee detailing the threats detected to critical infrastructure , the General Accounting Office noted " to date none of the traditional terrorist groups such as al Qaeda have used the Internet to launch a known assault on the U.S. 's infrastructure . " It is much easier , and almost certainly much deadlier , to strike the old-fashioned way . <p> Government computers have been targeted by politically minded hackers , but these attacks are hardly life threatening . They 're typified by last October 's penetration of a Defense Department Web site dedicated to " Operation Enduring Freedom " and , somewhat incongruously , a Web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The organization responsible was called the " al Qaeda Alliance Online " and was comprised of groups with names like GForce Pakistan and the Pakistani Hackerz Club  --  names that connote a Certain adolescent worship of hip-hop that 's a clue to the participants ' relative lack of menace ; none turned out to have actual terrorist ties . <p> In both cases , the attackers replaced the government sites ' home pages with photos and anti-American text  --  but that 's all they did . Robbed of this context , as is usually the case with reports of politically motivated cyberattacks , such manifestations are often presumed to be much more serious terrorist threats than is warranted . " When somebody defaces a Web site , it 's roughly equivalent to spray painting something rude on the outside of a building , " says James Lewis , director of technology policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies . " It 's really just electronic graffiti . " The Gloom Boom <p> Yet Washington hypes cyberterrorism incessantly . " Cyberterrorism and cyberattacks are sexy right now . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Georgetown 's Denning . Indeed , a peculiar sort of one-upmanship has developed when describing the severity of the threat . The most popular term , " electronic Pearl Harbor , " was coined in 1991 by an alarmist tech writer named Winn Schwartau to hype a novel . For a while , in the mid-1990s , " electronic Chernobyl " was in vogue . Earlier this year , Sen. Charles Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) warned of a looming " digital Armageddon . " And the Center for Strategic and International Studies , a Washington think tank , has christened its own term , " digital Waterloo . " <p> Why all this brooding over so relatively minor a threat ? Ignorance is one reason . Cyberterrorism merges two spheres  --  terrorism and technology  --  that most law-makers and senior administration officials do n't fully understand and therefore tend to fear , making them likelier to accede to any measure , if only out of self-preservation . Just as tellingly , many are eager to exploit this ignorance . Numerous technology companies , still reeling from the collapse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to national security and boosted their Washington presence in an effort to attract federal dollars . As Ohio State University law professor Peter Swire explained to Mother Jones , " Many companies that rode the dot-com boom need to find big new sources of income . One is direct sales to the federal government ; another is federal mandates . If we have a big federal push for new security spending , that could prop up the sagging market . " <p> But lately , a third motive has emerged : Stoking fears of cyberterrorism helps maintain the level of public anxiety about terrorism generally , which in turn makes it easier for the administration to pass its agenda . Profit of Doom <p> At the center of all this hype is Richard Clarke , special adviser to the president for cyberspace security , a veteran of four administrations , and terrorism czar to Bill Clinton . Even though he was a senior Clinton official , Clarke 's legendary bureaucratic skills saw him through the transition ; and when replaced by Gen. Wayne Downing after September 11 , Clarke created for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat of cyberattack . Understanding that in Washington attention leads to resources and power , Clarke quickly raised the issues profile . " Dick has an ability to scare the bejesus out of everybody and to make the bureaucracy jump , " says a former colleague . The Bush administration has requested a 64 percent increase in cybersecurity funds for next year . <p> Last month , I paid Clarke a visit in his office a few blocks west of the White House to talk about the threat and discovered that even he is beginning to wilt under the false pretense of cyberterrorism . As I was led back to meet him , his assistant made an odd request : " Mr. Clarke does n't like to talk about the source of the threat , he 'd rather focus on the vulnerability . " And indeed , the man who figured most prominently in hyping the issue seemed particularly ill at ease discussing it . <p> Clarke is in the curious bind of an expert on terrorism charged to protect the nation against a form of the disease that has yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one very real cybersecurity threat is unfolding : the damage , largely economic , being done by hackers and criminals . Last year , 52,000 cyberattacks were reported , up from 21,000 the year before . Yet Clarke 's greatest leverage is misperception about the true source of this threat . In his careful way , he tried to guide our conversation away from terrorism and toward cybersecurity . <p> " To date , " he readily conceded , " we 've never seen any of the officially designated terrorist groups engage in a cyberattack against us . " But he stressed that little noticed in the aftermath of September 11 was a large-scale cyberattack seven days later  --  the Nimda virus  --  that proved extremely costly to private industry . " Nimda hit a lot of businesses that thought they had done a good job securing themselves , " Clarke explained . " And a lot of CEOs got really pissed because they thought they had spent a lot of time and money doing cybersecurity for the company and  --  bang !  --  they got hammered , knocked offline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dollars per company ? " The $15 billion in damage caused by cyberattacks last year is derived mostly from worms , viruses , denial-of-service attacks , and theft , all of which capitalized on the generally lax cybersecurity in the private-sector businesses that comprise about 85 percent of the Internet . Many vulnerabilities are imported through the use of products by private companies , such as Microsoft , that supply software . There is no regulatory mechanism to ensure that they meet security standards ; and as Clarke notes , " there 's no legal liability if you are the software manufacturer and sell somebody something that does n't work . " <p> He also pointed out that a typical company devotes one-quarter of 1 percent of its information technology budget to cybersecurity , " slightly less than they spend on coffee . " By contrast , the Bush administration 's FY 2003 budget would spend 8 percent , or 32 times higher a proportion . Yet even this considerable outlay does n't guarantee that the government 's systems are secure . The same poorly written and configured software that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government is , after all , Microsoft 's largest customer . John Gilligan , the Air Force CIO and one of the fiercest advocates of stronger safety standards in government , says that 80 percent of successful penetrations of federal computer systems can be attributed to software full of bugs , trapdoors , and " Easter eggs "  --  programming errors and quirks inserted into the code ( see box ) that could leave software vulnerable to hackers . What 's more , as federal agencies move away from proprietary systems toward universal software , this becomes a greater problem not just in terms of security , but also of cost . " The assessment I make is that we 're fast approaching the point at which we 're spending more money to find , patch , and correct vulnerabilities than we paid for the software , " says Gilligan . Bad for Business <p> The danger of hyping a threat like cyberterrorism is that once the exaggeration becomes clear , the public will grow cynical toward warnings about real threats . The Chicken Little approach might be excusable were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dealing with the true problem posed by hackers and shoddy software . There is a precedent for this sort of thing . In the midst of all the anxiety about the Y2K bug , the federal government and the SEC came up with a novel way to ensure that private companies were ready : They required businesses to disclose their preparations to shareholders , setting goals and letting market forces do the rest . <p> There were high hopes , then , for the Bush administration 's National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace  --  the culmination of a year 's effort to address the country 's post-9/11 cybersecurity problems . Clarke 's team circulated early drafts that contained what most experts considered to be solid measures for shoring up security in government , business , and home computers . But the business community got word that the plan contained tough ( read : potentially costly ) prescriptions , and petitioned the White House , which gutted them . When a draft of the plan was rolled out in mid-September , Bill Conner , president of the computer security firm Entrust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Ph.D . wrote the government items , but it reads like someone a year out of grade school wrote the rest of the plan . " <p> It 's hard to imagine a worse outcome for all involved , even private industry . By knuckling under to the business community 's anti-regulatory impulses , Bush produced a weak plan that ultimately leaves the problem of cybersecurity to persist . It proposes no regulations , no legislation , and stops well short of even the Y2K approach , prompting most security experts to dismiss it out of hand . What it does do instead is continue the stream of officially sanctioned scaremongering about cyberattack , much to the delight of software companies . IT security remains one of the few bright spots in the depressed tech market and thus that important sector of the market is perfectly satisfied with the status quo . But as the Nimda virus proved , even companies that pay for security software ( and oppose government standards ) do n't realize just how poorly it protects them . So in effect , the Bush administration has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightening businesses into investing in security , but refusing to force the changes necessary to make software safe and effective . <p> The way the Bush White House has exaggerated the likelihood of cyberterrorism is familiar to anyone who 's followed its style of government . This is an administration that will frequently proclaim a threat ( the Saddam/al Qaeda connection , for instance ) in order to forward its broader agenda , only to move on nonchalantly when evidence proves elusive or nonexistent . But in this case , by moving on , Bush leaves unaddressed something that really is a problem  --  just not one that suits the administration 's interests . Forced to choose between increasing security and pleasing his business base , the president has chosen the latter . Hyping a threat that does n't exist while shrinking from one that does is no way to protect the country . <p> There is , for instance , an entire videogame secretly embedded in Microsoft Excel 2000 .
