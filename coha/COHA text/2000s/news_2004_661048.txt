<p> Curtis Levin may live in a swing state , but there 's nothing wavering about his intention to vote for John Kerry this November . Picking up some hoagies at Barton 's Deli , he pours forth a ready list of political grievances : George W. Bush is " a puppet who does n't have any original ideas , " and who will appoint antiabortion justices to the Supreme Court . The war in Iraq is " a joke . " And while " they say war is good for the economy , " Mr. Levin scoffs , " I do n't have any extra money . " <p> He and his wife work long hours - he at a medical marketing-research company , she as a medical illustrator - and they 're paying more for healthcare , a particular concern now that his wife may need an expensive back operation . <p> Less than 15 miles away , Brian Annillo sees this election in equally stark terms - only from the opposite view . Senator Kerry is " a flip flopper , " for whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being undermined by the media and has in fact gone relatively well : " I do n't believe any country in the world has ever been taken over with less than 1,000 casualties . " The local economy is strong - housing prices are skyrocketing , he notes . Indeed , his only real grievance has to do with traffic : Tired of commuting into Philly , he 's opening a new business selling children 's furniture . <p> Both Messrs . Levin and Annillo live in one of the most contested congressional districts in the country , tucked within one of the nation 's top battleground states . Stretching from the working class neighborhoods of Northeast Philadelphia to the ritzier suburbs outside the city , and the farm-dotted exurbs beyond , pollsters have already labeled the 13th district a bellwether - the area most likely to determine which way the state , and possibly the nation , tips . <p> Over the past 10 years , the seat has switched from Republican to Democratic , back to Republican , and then back to Democratic again . Pennsylvania pollster Terry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't exist , it would have to be invented to describe many of the voters in the 13th congressional district . " <p> But while voters here have a long history of moderate views and ticket splitting , almost no one is undecided when it comes to this fall 's election . <p> " Purple " states like Pennsylvania are often held up as the exception to the red-blue divide - and they are , in the sense that they 're not reliably tilted toward a single party . Republicans and Democrats within these states have plenty of exposure to one another , and theoretically are more likely to cross party lines at the ballot box . <p> But that does n't mean the nation 's purple states are n't exhibiting the effects of polarization . In fact , in some ways , the red-blue divide shows up with even greater intensity . <p> The nation 's purest swing district ? <p> Here in Pennsylvania 13 , the relatively even mix of partisan views and looming sense of high stakes - all condensed within a small radius - combine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both sides of the divide express strong political beliefs , and even stronger frustration with members of the opposing party , many of whom they count as neighbors . <p> One of the few things Levin and Annillo agree on is that the bitterness between the parties has n't always been like this . But lately it seems to be growing . Annillo , for one , blames the media . " The media is extremely biased , " he says . News consumers on both sides are getting " opinion and not the facts , " inflaming debate . <p> Levin traces the schism to " an economic division . " His hometown of Abington , he says , is increasingly split between wealthy residents who are getting richer by the day , and middle and lower-middle class people who are struggling to get by . " You 're either one or the other , " he notes . He also blames the rise of cultural issues like abortion , which he sees as inherently uncompromising : " You 're either pro-choice or you 're not . " Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . " There 's really no bending . " <p> Both presidential candidates are focusing intently on Pennsylvania , a state rich with 21 electoral votes , which Al Gore won in 2000 by just 5 percent . President Bush has visited 30 times since taking office , often stopping in towns in and around the 13th district . Kerry is campaigning hard here , too , last week kicking off a " front porch tour " outside Philadelphia . He also staged his first photo-op with running mate John Edwards at the Pittsburgh farm of his wife , Teresa Heinz Kerry - an estate that belonged to Mrs. Kerry 's late husband , Pennsylvania Sen. John Heinz ( R ) , who remains highly popular here . <p> Solidly Republican from the 1860s through the 1920s , Pennsylvania was the only major state to vote for Herbert Hoover over Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 . But Roosevelt 's New Deal and the rise of the union movement soon brought the state 's many steelworkers and coal miners decisively into the Democratic column - splitting the state down the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next seven decades . <p> For years , economic divisions dominated the political landscape , with the wealthier eastern part of the state traditionally in the GOP camp , and the more industrial western part allied with the Democrats . But lately , the rise of cultural issues has created new political crosscurrents . Culturally conservative voters in the west are finding growing appeal in the Republican Party , while socially liberal voters in the east are moving toward the Democrats . <p> The result is a state that backed Mr. Gore in 2000 and elected a Democratic governor , Ed Rendell , in 2002 - but where Republicans outnumber Democrats 12 to 7 in the US House , and both US senators are Republicans as well . <p> The 13th district , which cuts an oblong swath from Northeast Philadelphia out through Montgomery County , is in some ways a microcosm of the state itself . It includes a variety of races and classes - and a striking clash of partisan views . Its urban sections are less Democratic than one might expect , and its suburban parts less Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northeast Philadelphia , grassy plots are decorated with colorful lawn ornaments and American flags . This is a part of the city once settled by immigrants - German , Italian , and Irish - and it 's still populated by blue-collar workers , firefighters , and cops . Culturally , the neighborhood leans Republican . <p> But the presence of many union members also gives the area a Democratic counterbalance : Signs on lampposts read : " Teamsters for Kerry . " And lately an influx of minorities is furthering that Democratic trend . <p> Sitting on her front stoop , watching the traffic go by , Rose Richard typifies the changes to this neighborhood . A Haitian immigrant , she 's studying at Drexel University , while working at a local hospital . She 's also a Democrat who plans to vote for Kerry - largely because of her concerns about health insurance and the availability of student financial aid . Kerry 's no Bill Clinton - " he was awesome , " she smiles - but she 's seen the Massachusetts senator 's commercials , and he has her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move in , longtime Republicans here do n't seem to be altering their views . Many are growing more stalwart . <p> Gene Costanzo has been cutting locals ' hair in his shop along Cottman Avenue for 24 years now . A native Italian who moved here in 1950 , he was initially a Democrat , but switched around the time of Ronald Reagan 's presidency and has been " strongly " Republican ever since . " I guess I was not satisfied with the Democrats , " he explains , adding simply : " I work all my life , and they 're spending my money . " <p> Directly next door , Mr. Costanzo 's son Michael runs a sporting-goods store , where he outfits local Little League teams . He 's more staunchly conservative than his father . There 's " nothing " he does n't like about Bush , whom he regards as " a good , religious man . " Although Kerry is Roman Catholic like himself , Costanzo thinks the candidate is " not much of a Christian , " since he supports abortion rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iraq war - " if we do n't fight it overseas , we 're going to be speaking Arabic in this country " - he says that if Kerry wins , he 'll be " pretty upset . " <p> Costanzo knows his views cause friction among some of his neighbors : " I 'm pretty conservative for this area , " he admits . " Democrats have a hard time talking to me . " He recalls a recent " screaming " match he had with an ex-girlfriend about Iraq . But he 's equally frustrated by what he sees as many union members ' unthinking loyalty to the Democratic Party . They 're " basically puppets " of the union leaders , blindly buying into arguments that they could lose their jobs , he says . " They 're just scared . " <p> The view farther out Route 73 <p> Outside the city , the landscape changes : Urban neighborhoods quickly give way to leafy suburbs with expensive antique houses . Route 73 , which cuts through the 13th district , runs past charming villages like Blue Bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assortment of antique shops and pet-grooming stores . Employers here include pharmaceutical companies like Merck and Wyeth , and there 's a burgeoning high-tech industry . <p> At the outer reaches of the district , the scenery becomes rural Mennonite country . Mixed with the farms , however , is a growing number of new developments : clusters of big , identical houses , with three-car garages and fake stone siding - luring upwardly mobile families with the promise of more house for their money . <p> But while the new scenery brings some shifts in political views and priorities , the partisan loyalties of the voters are no less fierce . Some voters , particularly in the closer-in suburbs , stake out moderate positions , and a few even offer tempered criticism of their own party . Significantly , many say their vote is driven more by opposition to the other side 's candidate than enthusiasm for their own - a reflection , perhaps , of the region 's steady diet of negative advertising . <p> While Democrats express strong distaste for Bush , many also admit to lukewarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much about him . Republicans say they want no part of the Massachusetts senator , but several also admit they do n't approve of everything the president has done . <p> To some extent , residents note , the area 's wealth , which once tied it securely to the Republican Party , also enables the adoption of certain liberal stances . It 's the kind of place where " people can afford to be progressive , " explains Eric Podietz , noting that his town of Upper Dublin has an active - albeit expensive - recycling program . <p> The town of Ambler offers a coffee house and an art theater that is currently showing " Fahrenheit 9/11 . " But , perhaps in a nod to the mix of partisan views , the theater also offers " rebuttal papers , " an assortment of positive and negative articles about the movie , for its patrons . <p> Mr. Podietz , who just purchased tickets to " Fahrenheit , " is a Democrat who says he 's never voted Republican . When it comes to Bush , he says unequivocally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citing his " overly simplistic notions , " his " arrogance , " and the way he " favors business . " But he 's not thrilled with Kerry either , seeing him as " kind of business as usual , " though he does like that Kerry is a decorated war veteran . <p> Many voters here readily admit that they have much stronger feelings about this presidential election than in the past . And many say that their partisan fealty is primarily at the presidential level . They show a willingness to cross party lines in local and state elections . <p> Coming out of a late afternoon showing of " Fahrenheit , " Jane Spigel declares she 'd " vote for Mickey Mouse " over Bush in the upcoming election . Ms. Spigel is adamantly opposed to the Iraq war and what she sees as the unnecessary loss of innocent lives . A full-time student in elementary education , she admits she does n't necessarily think Kerry is the " best man for the job " - indeed she has " a lot of respect " for Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , " and she plans to volunteer for the Kerry campaign this summer . <p> Spigel may oppose Bush , but she does n't feel the same about all Republicans . Her local state representative , she says , is a Republican and was " extremely helpful " with an insurance problem . " I 'd definitely vote for her , " she says . At the national level , she points to John McCain as a Republican she " would vote for . " <p> Even more striking , she recently made a pilgrimage to Washington to view Ronald Reagan 's casket - catching the 11:30 p.m. train out of 30th Street Station , and waiting for more than seven hours in a line " that made Disney look like nothing , " to go through the Capitol Rotunda and pay her respects . <p> " Whether or not I agreed with all his policies , he was president of the United States , " she says . " It was an honor to pay respect to him . " <p> Typically , the most persuadable group of voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the so-called " soccer moms , " later dubbed " security moms , " who tend to be socially moderate but fiscally conservative , who worry about terrorism but also about education . Most are registered Republicans , but many also voted for Clinton and Gore . <p> For many , it 's the ' anti ' election <p> Yet this time around , almost no one seems inclined to cross party lines . Watching her four kids navigate the " starship " ride at a carnival at the Wissahickon High School near Ambler , Republican Karen Williams describes her vote as " more anti-Kerry than pro-Bush . " Kerry " waffles a lot , " she says . But while Bush has " done some good , " she also thinks " the country 's being distracted a lot by Iraq . " <p> Initially she favored the war - " the intent was good , " she says . But lately she 's concluded , " it just ca n't be implemented . It 's turning into a mini-Vietnam . You ca n't pull out , and there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams grew up in this area and came back to raise her own family here . " It 's a very solid place , " says the stay-at-home mom . Her husband works for a big pharmaceutical company - " hence , Republican , " she jokes . She 's always voted with the GOP , and says she will stick with the president this fall . <p> Standing with Williams , Diane Jeckovich says she too will vote for Bush because " he 's safer for business , " but adds : " not that I agree with everything that 's happened . " She supports the war in Iraq , but thinks " there were probably a lot of mistakes made , " and " it 's a shame it 's dragged on this long . " <p> Like Williams , Ms. Jeckovich typically votes Republican , but notes that she supports abortion rights and stem-cell research . In 1996 , she voted for Clinton over Bob Dole . But she ca n't envision crossing party lines this time : " I think Kerry 's scary , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are more passionate ones , like Joe and Mary Mallon , attending the carnival with their kids . <p> Mr. Mallon , a physician , was once a registered Democrat - but says he 's always voted Republican and has become more conservative since getting married . He agrees with Bush on " most things , " though he notes , " some valid questions have been raised " about Iraq . He sees a stark division between the two parties over social issues . " Clinton was probably more fiscally responsible than Bush , " he says . But " the Lewinsky thing really turned my stomach . " <p> His wife is a self-proclaimed straight-ticket Republican , who just purchased a T-shirt off a website that reads : " Michael Moore is fat . " Raised in an Italian family of Republicans in South Philadelphia , she 's always voted with the GOP - but grew much more conservative in recent years , largely over the issue of abortion . She lost a child , she explains , and after that grew more active in the Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life . <p> A stay-at-home mom , Ms. Mallon listens to Sean Hannity on the radio and says she finds herself " yelling and screaming " about the politics of her more liberal neighbors . " We all sort of coexist , " Mr. Mallon says . " This is a very volatile area . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
