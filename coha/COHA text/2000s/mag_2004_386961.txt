American Illustrators Hall of Fame Toboggan or not toboggan ? That is the question as Post illustrators take us on an action-filled outing through the snow-filled covers of yesteryear . <p> " The problem with winter sports , " says Dave Barry . " is that they generally take place in winter . " No sweat for our Post illustrators  --  who braved snow , sleet , flying pucks , slippery slopes , and even burned hot dogs to capture the fun side of winter on canvas , Their pictures take us from the warm glow of John Clymer 's icy picnic to Mead Schaeffer 's snow-pillowed Vermont mountain trail , the famous Big Bromley , where one of our illustrators actually gets into the picture , much to his dismay , Meanwhile . the elegant Ski Weld and his opposite , the ski-klutz Constantin Alajalov , illustrate the how-tos and how-not-tos of negotiating the slopes . John LaGatta shows how pride goeth before a fall in the ice rink . And George Hughes illustrates what happens when Old Man Weather pulls the snowy blanket from under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toboggan run . our illustrators ( for a short while , at least ) have us believing winter is n't such a bad place , after all . <p> No question about it , this painting proves John Clymer was a master portrayer of ice . This was something the artist had plenty of experience with , no doubt . having grown up in Ellensburg . Washington , and living in Teton Village . Wyoming , when this Post cover was done . Our only question is : Where did all that dry firewood come from ? <p> Who but an artist by the name of Ski would come up with a cover like this one ? Ski Weld 's elegant portrayal of dashing sports figures brought a touch of art deco glitz to Post covers in the late ' 30s and early ' 40s . <p> Who cares what they 're doing ? Good-looking girls make good-selling covers . So we have on the left one of John LaGatta 's many lovely models , all suited up for winter play . Who said sledding is just for kids ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friendly battle in the snow . Mead Schaeffer 's theme in this February 2 , 1946 , cover painting might be the smallness of man ( and woman ) in the lap of nature . The actual place is Big Bromley , near Manchester , Vermont . The lead skier is John Atherton , another Post illustrator and veteran cross-country skier who took a very dim view of the outlandish outfit Schaeffer painted on him . Only a novice would dress like that , he growled . <p> Look Out Below might be an appropriate title here . Cutting lovely figure eights might not be the strong suit of this stylishly dressed John LaGatta lady , but it 's likely she 'll have plenty of male help getting upright again . ( right ) The fun is in the journey , not the arrival . And this overloaded toboggan seems to be cruising for a bruising . Fortunately , artist Alan Foster has wisely put Porky in the driver 's seat to provide some cushioning effect . <p> Here we are back at Big Bromley again  --  a favorite winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autobiographical , painted from painful memory by artist Constantin Alajalov . " It 's as close to a self-portrait that I 'll ever do , " he noted , and probably as close as he ever came to a ski slope again , as well . <p> There 's one sure way these disappointed slopemeisters can make the rain turn back into the beautiful powder promised by the weatherman . All they have to do is hop in their cars and start home . Artist George Hughes , a skier himself , knew this situation well . <p> This January 18 , 1936 , Post cover by artist Maurice Bower shows how ice hockey players dressed in the days before the sport really got rough . Team red goalie has just made a spectacular save , and the white team is more than a bit disgruntled . Now it 's up to the clean-cut guy with the Ronald Reagan haircut . <p>
