The UPN show " Girlfriends " drives this point home as it explores issues about life , love , sex and men for a second season . The comedy centers around the lives of four spirited , upwardly mobile friends : Joan ( Tracee Ellis Ross ) , a top-notch attorney who is knocking at the door of 30 and feels that she has everything going for herself in life except a man ; Toni ( Jill Marie Jones ) , who sells real estate and is a classic " material girl " who 's in hot pursuit of a man with a hefty bank account ; Maya ( Golden Brooks ) , who is Joan 's assistant at the law firm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the one they envy most because she married her high school sweetheart , Darnell ( Khalil Kain ) , and is the mother of a son ; and Lynn ( Persia White ) , the modern-day equivalent of a 60s flower child , lives rent-free with Joan , with whom she attended graduate school . The only problem is that Lynn does n't want to grow up and is still in grad school some eight years later ! Then , there 's the " honorary girlfriend , " William ( Reggie Hayes ) , Joan 's friend and colleague at the law firm . No group of girlfriends would be complete without the guy everyone considers " like a brother " because " he 's too nice " to be considered for a boyfriend .

" Photograph A Lynn ( White ) ( c ) , the free spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their feet with her unconventional thoughts about life . // During the first season , viewers got a chance to become familiar with the saucy group . This season the characters are hit with tough issues that often test the boundaries of their friendship . Joan and Toni butt heads when Toni decides to get in on a piece of the action in the romance department with Joan 's man ; Maya feels compelled to " find herself , " while her husband attributes her self-discovery to her meddlesome girlfriends ; Lynn learns the hard way that she must add the word responsibility to her vocabulary ; and William shows that " nice guys " can finish first when he decides to wed his police officer girlfriend , Yvonne ( Cee Cee Michaela Harshaw ) . Make no mistakes about it , while the show offers plenty of comedy , it is n't afraid to approach taboo issues such as racism or female health concerns . " Touchy subjects are sensitive , " says White , who in real life is biracial and plays a biracial , adopted character . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price you pay to see the funny side of life . Humor is therapy . " Ratings show that audiences like this form of therapy . The second season premiere of the show scored the best ratings in its Monday time slot in more than six years among women 18-34 and 18-49 . The comedy also delivered the time period 's best performance in more than five years among adults 18-34 , 18-49 and total viewers for UPN . " You ca n't always put a finger on what works or why something works , " explains Ross of the show 's appeal . " God touched our show . The flavor of it feels good for us and people are feeling that . You get four different perspectives . There is also a good male voice on the show . " Brooks elaborates on the show 's expanding audience : " It 's a reality bite . It is n't just about sex and someone cheating on a partner . We deal with issues people are embarrassed to deal with or talk about . My character had a fibroid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these characters and go deeper into their lives . The comedy is coming from the issue as opposed to from the joke . " Photograph Joan attempts to juggle a demanding career with an equally demanding personal life with Sean ( Dondre T. Whitfield ) . Photograph A " Frasier " TV star Kelsey Grammar , who serves as an executive producer for the comedy , guest-starred on the show during its first season . // Martha Brock Akil , the show 's creator who also serves as an executive producer , says the ensemble comedy works because people see things they can identify with . " We do n't do all the politically correct stories , " says Akil . " We do n't do and say all of the right things all the time . We 're human and do that for a reason ... People like to laugh and be challenged . We 're tired of being portrayed in a light we do n't see ourselves as . We 're very complex . The characters are complex and our images are well represented . " For Jones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her character 's life just about hits rock bottom this season . But , all is not lost . Gospel great Donnie McMurkin will guest star on the special Halloween episode , slated to air next week , where she picks herself up and gets her life back in order . " You will root for Toni again . I love to play her . She has room for growth ... She 's not really happy with who she sees in the mirror . That has prompted her insecurity . She came from nothing , but you would never know it , and vowed she would never be poor again . That 's why she always dates wealthy men and puts on this disecise . " Audiences can brace themselves for more surprising twists and turns with the girls this season . Being on UPN leaves the possibilities endless , says Hayes . " It 's liberating because we can take more chances . The payoff is bigger if the risks are bigger ... The show deals with four women you would n't necessarily put together , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . And it has a cute guy thrown in , " he laughs . Photograph A Martha Brock Akil , the show 's creator and one of its executive producers , says , You can win anyone over with an intelligent , smart and funny show . We 're not afraid of tackling the serious side of friendship . We show their journeys and plights and handle them in a real poignant and funny way . " // <p>
