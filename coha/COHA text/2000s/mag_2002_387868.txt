These comfortable internal frames will handle moderate loads for less than your last grocery bill . BY DANA . NELSON // Some years ago , when I was just out of college and buying gear on a budget , I coveted an internal frame backpack for its back-hugging stability , freedom of movement , and versatile portability . Problem was , I nearly needed another student loan to get the pack I wanted . How times have changed . Today you can shoulder an internal frame without going on a mac-and-cheese diet for a month . To test the latest crop of value-priced packs , we collected three models that can haul weekend to weeklong loads ( more than 4,200 cubic inches ) , cost less than $110 , and feature adjustable torsos . Testers Kari Bodnarchuk , Jack Igelman , and I toted loads for several months over trails in the Pacific Northwest , New England forests , and the Appalachian Trail . The reviews follow in order of ascending price . I loved the style of the packbag on the Triad . With a roomy lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of king-size side pockets , this pack offered just what I like : space to cram all my gear , plus a few easyaccess options for sorting out essentials . As much as I liked the packbag , though , the fit of the pack left me-and the other testers-wanting . The shoulder straps , while nicely contoured and padded , were too short for Jack and me . The minimal torso adjustment-the hipbelt is fixed in place , and the shoulder straps adjust only by varying their length and tensions on the load-lifter straps-did n't offer enough room to maneuver . Admittedly , we 're both big guys , but even 5 ' 4 " Kari , whose 17-inch torso lies smack in the middle of the pack 's range , found the suspension a tad small . The limits on the suspension system , coupled with the modest hipbelt padding , create a pack that is well suited to smaller hikers carrying loads of up to 30 pounds ( though the pack boasts an extendable lid and spindrift collar , we do n't recommend overstuffing it ) .

This supportive , no-frills pack will appeal to hikers with long torsos and big loads With the longest torso length adjustment among the test packs , the Ascend proved to be the best-fitting model for both Jack and me ( 20- and 21-inch torsos , respectively ) . What 's more , the pack 's stout hipbelt and cushy padding matched its overall large-frame , large-load design . The thick hipbelt wrapped comfortably around my hips , and the padding extends far enough forward that I did n't feel cheated ( I have a 38-inch waist ) . I had no qualms about loading up the Ascend with 50-plus pounds of winter camping gear for an extended snowshoe trip . The 4-pound pack handled the load remarkably well , keeping me stable and comfortable on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Small-framed Kari , though , had trouble fitting the super-size suspension . " With the belt resting on my hips , the top of the padding dug into my ribcage , especially on uphill sections , " she said after a trek along the Mid-State Trail in Massachusetts . The Ascend features a simple packbag-one big main compartment , a roomy lower sleeping bag compartment , and a good-size top pocket . The design perfectly matched Jack 's " just cram it all in one big bag " philosophy . Jack and I both chose the Ascend as our favorite pack in the test ( though I wished it had more external pockets ) . Jack raised concerns about the Ascend 's durability after a strenuous trek in the Appalachians , reporting that the light fabric covering the hipbelt tore at one seam .

Sizes/fits : 1/16-20 " torso Weight ( mfr. /BP ) : 4 lbs . 7 oz. /4 lbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything will appreciate this pack , which delivers an assortment of pockets without sacrificing a snug , comfortable fit . After scrambling off-trail in the Berkshires with a weekend-size load , Kari had high praise for the Front Range . " This is undoubtedly the most stable , comfortable budget pack I 've used , " she said . Indeed , she dubbed it her second favorite pack of all time , regardless of price . The Rokk boasts a hipbelt with shaped padding to contour around the hips , and curved shoulder straps that fit snugly on her upper body without pinching or sliding . While Kari and her 17-inch torso fit the Front Range perfectly , anyone with a torso as long as mine ( 21 inches ) will find that the pack 's stated range of 16 to 20 inches is accurate : do n't try to exceed it . Even without a great fit , I could comfortably carry loads of up to 35 pounds with the Rokk . Kan also appreciated the RoWs pocket design . Large vertical exterior side pockets hold rain , sandals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of internal pockets stow a hydration bladder and small personal items . " As a clever bonus , " Kari adds , " a zippered pocket on the bottom of the pack holds a rain cover included that I could quickly pull out and over the pack when it began to sprinkle . " Durability was an issue , however . After extended use , the material at the top of the stays showed signs of fraying and the cinch-strap on the top pocket began to pull loose at the seam .
