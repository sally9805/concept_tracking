<p> Anita Chaudary is the first girl from her farming-caste village in dusty Rajasthan state to make it to 10th grade . Both of her parents are illiterate . But neither wants their promising daughter to spend her days bent in the fields , as they do . So when an all-girls school opened in Phagi , the small town supporting tiny surrounding villages like Mandi - Anita 's parents promised to help in any way they could . Traditionally , Rajasthan is one of the most regressive parts of India for females . Only about 35 percent of them can sign their names or read street signs . Only 2 of 10 get to Grade 8 . Yet attitudes about schooling girls are starting to change , even here . Phagi All-Girls Government School has taken away the argument and fears of rural parents who do n't want their adolescent daughters attending co-ed schools . It also deals another blow to one of the most insidious of arguments about rural South Asia : that parents do n't want their sons and daughters in school , but out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that child labor is the preferred - and only - option for poor offspring , is contradicted by Indian parents . What they ask for is decent education - a desire with which official India is still coming to terms . When Anita walks 45 minutes down a dirt road to school today , she dreams of " helping people , " of being a doctor . " But that will require a lot of work . My grades need to improve . I was careless in ninth grade , but I 'm studying harder now . What I really want is to travel to the US . But I 'll probably end up in Jaipur . " In her mind , she is not a village girl . She has visited her brother in nearby Jaipur , the state capital . She has been exposed to films , pop music , English-language magazines like Cosmopolitan and Elle . She and her friends shake with giggles when they tell of organizing semi-surreptitious dance competitions . At home Anita 's parents are proudly bewildered by their daughter 's new demands : She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her uncle jokes ruefully that when he comes home from the fields , his niece tells him to " take a bath . " Anita is not typical . She is a young woman who may escape the ordinary fate of females here . What she needs to do to ensure a better future , however , is score well on the all-India 10th-grade exam - the most important test for students in this country of 1 billion people . Anita studies fairly hard . What she does n't realize is how far behind she is : She does not know that only 5 percent of those who ever make it to 12th grade go to college . She has not been told of the coaching classes urban girls use to prep for the exam . She does not know how to use a computer ; her school does n't have one . Anita 's saviors may be the five often-heroic teachers who bounce in on a 70-minute bus ride to school and back each day to teach 300 sixth- to 12th-graders . They tell Anita her grades must rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They target her and several others to possibly join the dozen names enshrined on the principal 's wall - those who made it to higher study since the school opened in 1995 . About three-quarters of India is rural . In New Delhi , where it is easy to forget the country 's bulk , talk is of a " new India . " Following the nuclear tests of 1998 , and fueled by a more aggressive Hindu nationalist government , India seeks recognition as a " great nation " - deserving of a seat on the UN Security Council , among other things . Indeed , India 's most privileged 5 percent today get an education that rivals or is better than that available in the US - one of the many active legacies of the upper-caste tradition . Students are worked hard , in math and science especially , and their talents are forged in a mind-bogglingly stiff competitive arena . Widening urban-rural gap Yet if educating less-pedigreed sons and daughters is a benchmark for greatness , India has a long way to go . The story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chandighar , Bangalore , and Madras is not of a new India , but of a widening gap . Tensions are slowly building over what is a sadly simple equation in the countryside : a greater demand for better education - marked by less delivery . " The new ' real story ' is that the social cohesion of 30 years ago , when rich lived with poor , is no longer true , either for education or health , " says Krishna Kumar , former dean of Delhi University 's School of Education . " The segregation in India has grown wider . In many villages there is not a single middle-class child in a government school . The systems are poor ; the teacher- absentee rate is high ; the parents have no power ; there is a heavy failure rate among kids . " At Anita 's school , one teacher confides : " I would never let my daughter attend this school . She would never make it out of here . " The exact state of education in rural India is not well known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture is developed by private nongovernmental groups , or international organizations like the United Nations or the World Bank . One recent investigation into rural Uttar Pradesh state by the Madras-based Frontline magazine revealed that , in some schools , the teacher only showed up twice every few months . English instruction - needed for computer literacy , if nothing else - was rare . Books , blackboards , desks , and other common tools in that large northern state , often called " the cow belt , " were often missing . School conditions match the wrenching state of the Indian countryside : 226 million Indians have no safe drinking water , 640 million lack sanitation . Some 44 percent of India lives in absolute poverty . India has always had such problems . Some have improved . Yet unlike previous eras , lacking today is a reform-minded spirit . " Why do you need reform if you are happy at the top ? " Rajiv Desai asks bitterly . A columnist and adviser to the Gandhi political family , Mr. Desai echoes the critiques of many . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the US ? " For the first time , India 's slowly opening market economy is attracting modest direct foreign investment . The talented business class is relieved that old socialist norms set by founder Jawaharlal Nehru are being removed . Yet critics warn that the ideal of responsibility for one another , the egalitarian side of the idea of India put forward by Mohandas Gandhi , is gone . What has replaced it , Dr. Kumar notes , is a focus on projects like intercontinental ballistic missiles : India 's defense budget last year jumped 24 percent , the largest in memory . A hackneyed comparison speaks louder in a developing country : The cost of one ICBM could finance 65,000 new primary schools . In an otherwise triumphal anthem to his country , Gurcharan Das argues in the book " India Unbound " that " The 10 most important Indians are the education ministers of the 10 largest states ; the next 10 are the secretaries to these ministers . Alas , they do not realize their historic mission . " The lack of reform most affects village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ramachandran says of rural adolescent girls , " No one is today talking about the learning needs of this section of our society ... " The literacy myth In the larger scale of things , Indian schools , education policy , and the needed spirit of reform have been tragically hollowed out by 10 years of a cheaply bought emphasis on " literacy , " argue the current dean of Delhi University 's School of Education Anil Sadgopal and others . In the early 1990s , goes the story , India signed on eagerly to the ideals of " universal education . " In an evangelical campaign to increase the numbers of those who could read , policymakers funded a variety of " literacy campaigns " that sidestepped ailing school systems in villages and towns . Ten years later , literacy levels may have improved , but at the cost of doing the hard work of helping schools . The " parallel " literacy programs , also called " alternative education centers , " have largely dried up - with ordinary schools further forgotten and usually worse off . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one teacher from Anita 's school . " I 've watched how it works . When a female can sign her name , she is described as literate . Then she leaves and forgets what she 's learned . That is no education . Meantime , our school has no fans for the heat , no computers , five teachers for 300 students who sit on the floor , and no money for anything special , like field trips . " From a ground-level view , education problems for nonprivileged females seem a complex web of language barriers , poverty , lack of proximity to schools , patriarchy , sexual abuse , a colonial-era system of exams that allow no slip-ups , and a higher-education system with few seats . Yet these ills may derive from a more simple cause : an inability or unwillingness to address a tradition that amply rewards the few at the expense of the many . Indians abroad often tell their US counterparts that Brahminism in India is over with . Indeed , 19th-century horror stories , in which " untouchables " may not walk through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " Brahminism of the mind " is still a powerful fact in Indian society , says Mr. Desai , the political adviser . " The upper classes here do n't want the lower classes to succeed . That extends fully into education . In America , education is about empowerment . Here it is about selection . Ours is a Darwinian system , with strong roots in Brahminical attitudes about superiority . " But Anita and a few others like her continue to push the limits of the system . Urban parents in Delhi and Bombay credit the media for influencing their daughters to reach for more , to set their sights to live in the US , for example . Although to a lesser degree , girls in rural areas are also hearing more about the outside world through media , aid groups , and some teachers - and are testing old boundaries . Anita , for example , was part of a group of girls who held several underground dance contests by introducing Bombay music , the big song-and-dance numbers in Hindi films , to other village girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school for a group of girls from villages in the upper grade levels to live together in a youth hostel near the school . " Distance is our big problem . We have to walk such a long way and it is a waste of time . " she says . " Some parents did n't say ' no ' right away , and we could have got chaperones . But it did n't work out , " she says with a shrug . India 's rural schools may not yet prepare doctors and astrophysicists . But there 's a look in Anita 's eye that suggests she wo n't be a farm laborer , either . " The question is not if Indian parents and kids are finally ready to value a good education , " says Dr. Sadgopal . " They are ! They are waiting ! The question is whether the Indian government is ready . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 . The Christian Science Publishing Society
