Headnote Whether your mom is near or far , this month is the perfect time to celebrate your connection . Get inspired by five pairs of mothers and daughters who strengthened their bond in unique ways-from training for a marathon to fighting cancer . Niki Taylor and her mom , Barbara , may live more than 900 miles apart , but the two keep up with each other every day by phone and e-mail . Barbara says her daughter will often call from the grocery store to ask for the ingredients of one of her favorite dishes to make for her twin sons , Jake and Hunter , 12 , and her husband , NASCAR driver Burney Lamar . " We 're always on the phone sharing recipes , " she says . Cooking is , and always has been , an important activity in the Taylor household . " If you 're looking for us , head to the kitchen , " says Niki . " It 's where we have all of our important conversations . " Of course , with Niki 's busy schedule-from modeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Franklin , Tennessee-the only time the entire family gets together to whip up their favorite dishes is during the holidays . " My mom would always buy green bread for our sandwiches on Saint Patrick 's Day and put something sweet in our lunches for Valentine 's Day . It was like living in the movie Holiday Inn " says Niki . On the menu for the Taylors ' annual Memorial Day picnic : Barbara 's Sweet and Sour Summer Salad ( go to sbape.com/barbarasalad for the recipe ) . For the Taylor family , the holidays are also a time of healing . Their Memorial Day picnic takes place at a Florida park where a tree was planted in honor of Niki 's younger sister , Krissy , who died in 1995 of a rare heart ailment . And then there was Mothers Day 2001 . Only a few weeks earlier , Mild was involved in a car accident that was so serious she was in a coma for six weeks and had to undergo more than 50 operations to repair her internal injuries . It was her mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her the strength to get through the ordeal . To make the separation from her young sons more bearable for Niki , Barbara took photos of the boys and taped them to the ceiling in the hospital room so her daughter could see them every day . " She really took such great care of me and my sons , " says Niki . " I think everyone should have a mom and grandma like Barbara . " In 1999 , six weeks before her wedding , Sapna Singh was diagnosed with lupus , an autoimmune disease that causes the body to attack its own healthy tissue and cells , and a blood-clot disorder . But it was what the doctor said next that left her reeling : " You may never be able to carry a child . " He explained to her that only 50 percent of women with her condition have successful pregnancies , 25 percent miscarry , and another 25 percent have premature or stillborn babies . Sapna was devastated . " I had always dreamed of having three or four children , " she says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lucky ones . When she became pregnant in 2003 , she and her husband , Sonny , were elated . But a month later , she miscarried . Three more miscarriages followed over the next two years . With each pregnancy , her lupus would flare up and she 'd have horrible arthritic pains in her joints . " At one point my knee was so swollen I was unable to walk , " she says . Finally , Sapna 's mother , Ruby Tejwani , felt enough was enough . " It was hard to watch Sapna go through all those miscarriages and still long for a baby , " she says . " I had to do something to stop the pain . " She had volunteered to be her daughter 's surrogate in the past , and Sapna had always laughed it off . But now she accepted her offer , " For the first time , it hit me that this might be my only way to have a biological child , " she says . The doctors determined that Ruby , who had given birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , was in excellent physical health . But mere was a catch : She had reached menopause . To reverse it , she needed to give herself hormone injections for six weeks . Doctors then coordinated mother and daughter 's cycles , and in February 2005 , Ruby was implanted with Sapna 's fertilized eggs . Twelve days later , Ruby learned that she was pregnant . Ruby and Sapna had always talked on a daily basis , but during the pregnancy , they would see each other almost every day . Sapna accompanied her mom to her doctor 's appointments and attended to many of her needs-from taking her to dinner to playing Scrabble with her when she was put on bed rest for 11 weeks during her third trimester . " My mom 's a very active person , so lying around and doing nothing was hard for her , " says Sapna . " I felt guilty because that should have been me . " In September 2006 , Ruby gave birth to Sapna 's son , Syrus . While there is no cure for lupus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early . " I used to think that what my mom did was a sacrifice-even though she says it wasn't-and now I understand why she did it , " says Sapna . " I would do anything to make Syrus happy-you take care of your child no matter what you have to do . " Kristine Newby still is n't sure why the postcard that landed in her mailbox in spring 2002 spoke to her . The Leukemia &; Lymphoma Society was looking for people to raise money by running a marathon with its Team in Training program . Though she did n't know anyone with these types of cancers and did n't really consider herself a runner , she felt compelled to sign up . " I think I simply needed something big to strive for-and completing a marathon seemed to fit the bill , " she says . The mother of five tapped her daughter , Kari Silvers , a runner since second grade , as her training partner . Kari , who had been missing the camaraderie she 'd gotten from participating in school sports , agreed immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mom and get her as hooked on the sport as she was . Though Kristine had participated in some local races in the past , she 'd never really trained for them . For this marathon , she and Kari started slow , walking loops around their neighborhood four to six days a week . The walks gradually turned into runs , and for the next three months they partnered up on the shorter ( four- to seven-mile ) runs and did the longer ones on their own . " When we were running , I would slow my pace to hers and just encourage her to keep going , " says Kari . " This was my time to repay my mom for all the love and support she 'd given me over the years . " Their hours of training gave the twosome an opportunity to catch up on day-to-day matters and to deepen their relationship by discussing their innermost feelings and dreams . In October , Kari and Kristine flew to Portland , Oregon , for the marathon . Over dinner that night , they excitedly listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The next morning when we lined up before dawn at the starting line , I could feel my heart pounding , " says Kristine . " I 'd never done anything so physically and emotionally taxing before . " She logged 19 miles before her knees began throbbing . " It was hard watching people fly by me as I walked , but I did n't quit , " she says . Crossing the finish line-and having her daughter waiting there with a big hug-is something Kristine will never forget . Despite Kari getting married and moving 90 miles away , she and her mom run together every chance they get , including the Boston Marathon last spring . " I 've always gotten along with my mother , but our training time allowed me to know her even better , " says Kari . " I have a greater respect for her as a woman , an athlete , and a friend . " While doing a breast self-exam in fall 2000 , Kelly Larkin-Holmes felt a hard , jagged-shaped lump about the size of a pea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back negative , she was skeptical . Kelly pushed to have a more invasive excisional biopsy , which involved removing the lump , in February 2001 . One week later , the lab results were in : Kelly had invasive ductal carcinoma . Although this form of cancer is curable in many women , her tumor was hormone receptor ( HR ) - negative , which meant it was more aggressive and resistant to drug options like tamoxifen . Her treatment : a full lumpectomy and a lymph-node biopsy ( to make sure the cancer had n't spread ) , followed by seven months of radiation and chemotherapy . Kelly 's diagnosis prompted her mom , Diane , to see Kelly 's surgeon about a lump she 'd had for several months . The doctor told her that the lump had n't grown since her last visit . " It seemed like she was going to say , " Let 's keep watching it . ' ' " she recalls . " But when I reminded her that I was Kelly 's mom , she insisted on doing a needle biopsy right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was also the day before Kelly was to begin her chemotherapy treatments ) , the surgeon called Diane at work and gave her the bad news : Like her daughter , she had HR-negative invasive ductal carcinoma . " My world shattered when Kelly was diagnosed , " she says . " When I learned that I had it too , it simply seemed surreal . " During the next seven months , the two joined forces to fight the disease . " Since Kelly had all the procedures first , she could tell me what to expect , " says Diane . " She was the strong one . " For Kelly , however , the support went both ways : " My mom lived with my same aches and pains and still gave me advice and sympathy like only a mother can , " she says . There were times when Diane felt that some of her family and friends took her cancer lightly . " They either did n't know what to say , or they assured me that everything would be fine because they did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she and her daughter had each other to lean on . Kelly would call Diane crying in the middle of the night and her mother would do the same . " We understood each other 's fears , " says Diane . " For me , it was about dying , while Kelly 's biggest worry was whether she would be able to have kids . " The chemotherapy caused Kelly to experience early signs of menopause . " I did n't think I could conceive , " she says . " My ob-gyn even did some tests and said I had no viable eggs . " But four years after her diagnosis , Kelly did get pregnant . Her son , Trevor , is now 13 months old . She and her mom have been cancer-free for six years and are grateful for every healthy day they have-and for each other . " The best thing that came out of this is getting to know my daughter better , " says Diane . " We 'll never take our relationship for granted again . " On her days off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jamie Erbes grabs her toolbox and lends her time and talent to a cause that 's close to her heart : building homes for needy families . Working with Habitat for Humanity , which uses volunteers and donations of money and materials to build and rehabilitate homes for needy families , is extremely rewarding , says Jamie . " It 's definitely a thrill seeing a house we framed at the end of the day , " says Jamie . " But there 's nothing like a stranger hugging you after a day 's work and telling you that you 've changed her life . " Jamie 's life has been transformed as well-and that 's largely due to the fact that her mom , Mary Lucas , is typically working right alongside her . Mary , who was a technician for a telephone company for 30 years , went on her first trip with Habitat for Humanity in 2001 . Jamie , who had worked with the nonprofit organization during college , joined her on a project in 2004 . Since then the duo have done volunteer projects with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range from building wheelchair ramps to clearing debris from vacant , moldy houses in Louisiana in the wake of Hurricane Katrina . " It 's a very different way to hang out with each other , " says Mary . " Instead of getting our nails done , we ruin them together . " Spending weekends and vacations together has further cemented the mother and daughter 's already tight relationship . When they painted a nature center recently , they had nothing but time to catch up on each other 's lives . " We talked about careers and guys , " says Mary . " And I did n't just find out about whom she was dating , I got to hear all the details-what they were like , what she really thought about them . I 'd never get those kind of insights during a 20-minute phone call . " Jamie and Mary have also benefited personally from their experiences with Habitat for Humanity . " Volunteering helps you look outside of yourself , making you more compassionate and caring toward others , " says Mary . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 're bending , lifting , and carrying-working areas that you do n't necessarily target in the gym , " says Jamie . Mary agrees , adding that spending so much time outdoors in the fresh air keeps her healthy . " I feel great , " she says , " and have n't had a cold in 10 years . " Jamie , who learned carpentry from an uncle when she was 14 , feels blessed that her parents supported her job choice . " My mother had a nontraditional career and has always been an advocate of challenging gender stereotypes , " she says . " She taught me not only to do what I love but to use my gifts to help others . " Sidebar " If you 're looking for us , head to the kitchen . " Sidebar " Cooking keeps us close .
