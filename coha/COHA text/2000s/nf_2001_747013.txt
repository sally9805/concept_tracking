Large , white snowflakes are gently falling to the ground . By the time you read it , spring will be just around the corner . Now is the time to brush upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Making Better Wildflower Pictures " from Irene E. Dye , FPSA . <p> Irene says , " For the Nature Photographer , and many Pictorialists as well , there is no subject more exciting or more plentiful than wildflowers . In landscapes - wildflowers often add patches of color and life to the scene , and in closeups , the exquisite colors and structural design of flower subjects present beauty that only a picture can describe . " Beautiful color slides illustrate these statements . <p> Equipment , composition , lighting and backgrounds are all included in this slide illustrated how-to-do-it presentation . In many instances comparison slides illustrate the difference between the good and the not-so-good . <p> Equipment can be as sophisticated as the pocketbook will allow or as simple and inexpensive as a single lens reflex with a 50mm lens and a set of auxiliary plus lens , with which no increase in exposure is required . Slide numbers 27 through 33 cover the 50mm lens with plus lenses . Both the advantages and the disadvantages are pointed out . <p> In the field , the macro lens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desired magnification can not be achieved , Irene resorts to the use of her extension bellows . Its use is described and illustrated by slide numbers 40 through 43 . <p> The next series of slides in our photography field trip focus on backgrounds . Would you carry weathered wood , a jug of water and a sponge in your car to enhance and manipulate your background ? Irene and her husband Wayne do . Lighting ? Irene uses both daylight and strobe - with reflectors to fill the shadow areas . She tells it all . She even reveals the location of her favorite hunting areas . No stone is left unturned . <p> How can you obtain this slide show ? Write to : Walter Ross , Distributor , PSA - TD Slide Shows , 13010 N. 99th Drive , Sun City , Arizona 85315 .

A computer makes the task easier , but it does n't automatically produce an effective , reader-friendly newsletter . <p> Used skillfully , a computer will impart quality that entices readers ; used poorly , it creates chaos that discourages readers . If you need information on how to prepare a more readable newsletter with a computer , the following publications can supply it . They are easy to read , instructive and contain examples that illustrate the text . <p> Editing Your Newsletter by Mark Beach . <p> Producing a First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Book by Mark Beach and Elaine Floyd . <p> Newsletters From the Desktop by Joe Grossman with David Doty . <p> The secret to good writing in a newsletter is " revision .
