Forgive the good people of Seattle if they 're not sure what to make of their SuperSonics right now . Some , such as the local sports radio host who last Friday proclaimed them " the most positive story in the history of Seattle sports " have clearly drunk the mochacinno . Others are more hesitant to embrace the team , and who can blame them ? After all , these Sonics look suspiciously like the ones who went 37-45 in 2003-04 and were a consensus pick to miss the playoffs this season . Yet through Sunday their 17-4 record was second in the NBA only to the Phoenix Suns ' 17-3 . If one morning you started up the minivan and it drove like a Mustang , you 'd have a hard time believing it too . ? The evidence is compelling , however , that these Sonics wo n't fade away . Just listen to the vanquished . After the Sonics dumped the Mavericks 107-102 in Dallas last Thursday -- the night after snapping the San Antonio Spurs ' 21-game home winning streak 102-96 -- there was a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dallas with a torrential offense , jacking 84 shots and hitting 10 of 23 three-pointers , in essence out-Mav-ing the Mavs . " You do n't want to get into a shootout with them , " said Dallas guard Jason Terry , letting out a long , low whistle . " They 're deadly from all over . " // Guard Darrell Armstrong appeared to be in shock as he looked over the final box score . " They just kept firing , " he murmured , " and firing ... and firing . " // Added swingman Josh Howard , " They can pass , they can shoot , they got guys who are n't going to quit . They fo ' real . " // Or are they , the suspicious Sonics fans wonder , remembering the team 's 8-2 and 6-2 starts the past two seasons ? After all , only two nights after completing their Texas two-step , the Sonics took the floor at Key Arena against the persistently mediocre Boston Celtics . Emboldened by a nearly full house and the presence of local baseball hero Ichiro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched an assault on the rim . Or rather , at it . Seattle shot a jarring 32.6% and lost its first home game 98-84 . " I just wish , " Sonics forward Danny Fortson said with a grin while appraising his teammates , " that one of you mother --  --  -- - could have made a shot . " // Fortson 's comment , profane if not profound , is at least on point : Outside shooting is what makes Seattle tick . Led by Ray Allen ( 40.7% from three-point range at week 's end ) , Rashard Lewis ( 39.1% ) and Vladimir Radmanovic ( 40.8% ) , the Sonics were averaging a league-high 39.9% from behind the arc while shooting 79.3% from the line ( fifth best ) and averaging 100.7 points ( also fifth ) . But is a team that relies so heavily on marksmanship worthy of the praise lavished by Mavs coach Don Nelson ( who calls the Sonics " the new bully of the West " ) and his Portland Trail Blazers counterpart Maurice Cheeks ( " I could see Seattle or Phoenix making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player , guard Brent Barry , to the Spurs in free agency ? A team that has a lame-duck coach as well as seven players in contract years ? A team that lost to the Los Angeles Clippers by 30 on opening night -- which , as omens go , is like a marathoner needing a breather in the first mile ? // Well , yes , once you factor in Frodo and the Samurai . // on the flight home last spring after the final game of 2003 -- 04 , coach Nate McMillan listed his ideal starting lineup were the new season to begin the next day . Recalls McMillan , " I decided right there that my point guard was going to be Luke Ridnour. " // As a rookie out of Oregon last year , Ridnour suffered from inconsistent shooting ( 41.4% ) and wavering self-confidence , and his minutes fluctuated accordingly ( 34 one game , a DNP-CD another ) . Fans knew him mainly because of his floppy hair , which along with his boyish looks and slight build -- a spindly 6 ' 2 " , he gained 10 pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nickname of Frodo . His contributions this season , however , have been more like those of Frodo 's tireless helper , Samwise Gamgee . A native of Coeur d'Alene , Idaho , Ridnour grew up playing on the same courts where John Stockton lofted jumpers , and he displays a Stocktonian facility for distributing the ball . It was this quality , along with his speed , that excited McMillan , who says he saw Ridnour as " an extension of me. " // So this season , with a more poised ( and , sadly , more close-cropped ) Ridnour at the helm , the Sonics are a running , slashing team that rarely if ever posts up . Their offensive system is predicated on motion , back screens , quick passes and forays to the basket by Ridnour and backup point guard Antonio Daniels that free up the team 's sharpshooters -- whom McMillan likes to see launch from inside the arc as well . After a 103-95 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Nov. 16 , he was peeved that the Sonics had hit as many threes ( 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that 's not the game plan , " he says . " We 're an attacking team . I tell my guards , If you stop attacking , I 'll take you out . " // This leads to yet another unlikely aspect of the Sonics : They 're better off without Barry . Though he was a team leader as well as a superb passer and shooter , Barry , like Allen , preferred to hang on the perimeter , which meant the backcourt had no one adept at the drive-and-kick game . Had Barry stayed , it also would have been tougher to find minutes for Ridnour , who has gained confidence ( 9.1 points per game , 5.8 assists and 40.9% from downtown at week 's end ) in part because he knows he 'll get playing time . " It 's tough to keep five guards happy , " says G.M. Rick Sund . " When we lost Brent , it solved that problem . " // The Sonics also made another addition by subtraction when guard Flip Murray , the darling during last season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing only nine minutes in this season 's opener . ( He returned to active duty last Saturday . ) Though a gifted scorer , Murray is a Sam Cassell -- style guard : Hold the ball , hold the ball , shoot the ball . Last year his reluctance to share the rock led to some tension , in particular with Barry . In this season 's crisp-passing , European-flavored offense there is no place for me-firsting . McMillan has made clear : If Murray wo n't fit in , he will be sittin ' . // The team 's early success has also been the product of a clear offensive pecking order , which is as follows : Allen ( 23.8 points per game ) , then Lewis ( 21.0 ) , then everybody else . That everybody else includes Fortson , he of the Belushi-esque samurai sideburns and ponytail . Acquired from Dallas for center Calvin Booth in an off-season trade , he embodies the Sonics ' new ethos of muscularity in the paint : They ranked second in rebounding differential through Sunday ( +3.2 per game ) after finishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the half-court offense like a bumper car , slamming into opponents as he sets ( occasionally legal ) screens to spring shooters . He then plows toward the basket , where he has an uncanny knack for timing offensive rebounds , which he either tips in or otherwise takes to the hoop in the least graceful manner possible -- think construction worker attempting a jet ?  - -  usually drawing a foul . ( Not a bad thing , since in addition to averaging 6.8 rebounds in only 18.4 minutes at week 's end , he was shooting 85.5% from the line. ) // Fortson 's frontcourt mates , Reggie Evans , Nick Collison and Jerome James , are equally ungainly . They flail , they fall , they cut through the D with all the ease of a blunt knife through sirloin . But they board a lot , shoot judiciously and provide constant defensive intensity . " Those big guys , " says Allen , " are the key to the whole thing . " // The Sonics ' offense is a beautiful symbiosis between goons and shooters . In the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board and then tumbled to the ground in a heap with Dallas forward Alan Henderson . While the Mavs cleared the rebound , Fortson got his leg tangled up with **25;234;TOOLONG , of course -- pinning him to the ground and causing Nelson to turn red in anger . When a Mav misfired at the other end , Ridnour sent the ball the length of the court to the slow-to-rise Fortson , who , despite having a one-on-one , kicked it back out to a trailing Radmanovic , who drained a wide-open three-pointer . Total team ball . // The Sonics ' softness in recent years was hard to accept for McMillan , who as a Seattle guard from 1986 to ' 98 was known for his defensive tenacity . Forced last season to resort to trapping , he now uses the speedy Ridnour to harass opposing point guards -- another reason he 's starting -- and a rotation of bigs , all of whom , as Allen puts it , " know how to use their fouls . " These Sonics can extend , pressure the ball and play better weakside D. " We were always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing any defense , " says Lewis , who fingers himself as one of the culprits . " Instead of taking two , three games off , now I 'm coming out every night . This year everybody 's buying into it . " // The start has been redemptive for McMillan , who had been in danger of losing his job for the better part of a year . ( His contract expires at the end of the season , and Sund says the team wo n't talk about a new deal until then . ) A stoic perfectionist , McMillan figured that things would work out if he just stuck to his principles --  " playing the game the right way , respecting it and our opponents , " as he puts it . McMillan is very close to his older brother Randy , whom he heard from him after the Texas trip . " He 's a pretty strong guy , " says Nate , " but he was talking , and then the phone went silent . I thought I heard him sniffling . I could n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger brother talk about what he wanted to do and then seen it actually happen . He said , ' They 're playing like you . ' " // At their best the Sonics are , as Sund calls them , " a combination of the Mavericks and the Pistons , " able to shoot , pass and defend . Still , they are a young team -- no player is over 30 -- built to contend in a year or two , not now . The test will come when they lose three in a row or someone is thinking more about his next contract than the teammate who 's open in the corner . Even if the Sonics keep their cool , there are other questions . Can a team without an inside presence win in the playoffs ? What happens when the shooters go cold ? // For now the team and its fans are still getting used to the idea that such questions about the postseason may soon apply to the Sonics . As the Key Arena announcer said somewhat incredulously while the crowd filed out on Saturday , " Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in first place . "
