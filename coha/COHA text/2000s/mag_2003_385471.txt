Section : HERE 'S HOW WINDOWS TIPS Windows ME/98 XP/2K <p> SOME PEOPLE are happy to point and click their way through Windows ; many of us , however , find that typing commands and Web addresses is a faster and more efficient way to launch applications open documents , navigate to Web pages , and perform other routine PC tasks . <p> Address for success : One place where you can type commands is the ubiquitous Address bar in both Explorer folder windows and the Internet Explorer browser . If you do n't see it , choose View . Tool bars . Address Bar . With Explorer or Internet Explorer active , press &lt;Alt&gt;-D to highlight the current entry , and then begin typing . <p> To put the Address baron your taskbar , right-click an empty area of the taskbar and choose Tool barsAddress . If the entry field is n't big enough , drag the bar  --  with the pointer at the left edge of its name  --  to the left to enlarge it ( if the bar is not there , right-click the toolbar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar and your toolbars until the taskbar looks juuuust right ( see FIGURE 1 ) . <p> To resize and reposition the Address bar , drag the name  --  ' Address '  --  from your taskbar onto your desktop . You can also drag it to any screen edge to dock it there ; the top and bottom screen edges give you the most typing room . <p> Right-click the Address bar and choose Always on Top to make it always visible ( see FIGURE 2 ) . If the Address bar is docked in the taskbar or on a screen edge , you can right-click it and uncheck Show Title to hide the Address label . If the Address bar is docked but separate from the taskbar , right-click it and choose AutoHide to make it invisible until the pointer moves to that screen edge . <p> To access your desktop Address bar from your keyboard , press &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;ESC&gt; , &lt;ESc&gt; to activate the taskbar ( opening and closing the Start menu in the process ) ; then press &lt;Tab&gt; as many times as necessary until the Address bar is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double-chevron ( ) symbol indicating a pop-up menu , you may also have to press &lt;Esc&gt; at one or more points ( to dose such menus ) as you tab your way to the Address bar . Once the Address bar is active , scroll through your last several entries by pressing &lt;Up Arrow&gt; or &lt;Down Arrow&gt; . <p> Run wild : An even more accessible ( if not always visible ) place to enter commands and Web addresses is Windows ' Run box . Choose StartRun to view this box , or simply press &lt;Windows&gt;-R if you have a keyboard with the &lt;Windows&gt; key . <p> If you 'd rather launch the Run box from a Quick Launch or desktop icon , or if you have a mouse with a programmable button for launching apps , you can make a simple JavaScript file that will open the Run box . Open Notepad and type the line : ( new ActiveXObject ( " Shell.Application " ) ) . FileRun() . Choose FileSave As , navigate to a convenient folder , and type a file name with the . js extension  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this file on your desktop or Quick Launch toolbar , use the right mouse button to drag the file to one of these locations and choose Create Shortcut(s) Here . Click or double-click the icon ( or the original script file ) to display the Run box ( see FIGURE 3 ) . <p> If your computer associates JavaScripts with Notepad or another text editor , it wo n't run the script . To fix that , create a shortcut to the . js file as described above , right-dick the shortcut , and choose Properties . With the Shortcut tab in front , dick the beginning of the Target text box . Type wscript.exe and a space . Click OK . <p> Keyboard launches : Both the Address bar and the Run box let you open any folder , file , application , Web address ( URL ) , shortcut , or batch file by typing in its name . If the item is n't in a place Windows normally checks ( such as the Windows folder ) , you may need to type a complete path , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ networkdocs report.doc to open this network document in Word . If you 're in the habit of placing quotation marks around paths that use long names or spaces , the Run box wo n't mind , but the Address bar will think you 're looking for a Web address ; so avoid using such marks with that tool . <p> The Address bar lets you open Control Panel items by entering Control Panel followed by the item 's name ( for instance , Control PanelDisplay ) , or to open items in the Printers or Dial-Up Networking folders ( PrintersLaserJet , say ) . The Run dialog box 's commands are not as simple ( an example : control main.cpl keyboard ) . <p> Give orders : You can use the Address bar or Run box to issue what were once considered " external " DOS commands , such as attrib , move , or xcopy . In other words , you can type any command that exists as an independent application file in the WindowsCommand folder ( in Windows 9x and Me ) or the WindowsSystem32 folder ( in Windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the text files in your Documents folder to a folder called My Text Files , type xcopy c : documents*.txt " c : My Text Files " and press &lt;Enter&gt; ( quotation marks are required if any folder or file name contains spaces ) . Windows runs the command through a window that doses upon completion . ( If the window does n't dose , see the next tip . ) <p> Life 's a batch : To run so-called internal DOS-style commands in the Address bar or Run box , type command/c before typing the command ( or command/k to keep the command-prompt window open after executing the command ) . In Windows 2000 and XP , you can save a little typing by using ' cmd ' instead of ' command ' . <p> Here 's a quick way to make a batch file that renames groups of files automatically : Open Notepad , type rename %1 %2 , and press &lt;Enter&gt; . Save the file in the Windows folder as rn.bat . To convert all the . txt files in a folder to Word documents ( with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar or Run box to type something like rn " c : My Documents*.txt " *. doc ( your path is likely to differ , of course ) . <p> If the command-prompt window that runs your batch file stays open after the batch file is done , dick the icon on the left end of the window 's title bar and choose Properties . Under the Program tab , check Close on exit and dick OK The next time you run that batch file , the window will close automatically when it 's done . <p> Commands in batch files saved with the . cmd extension ( instead of . bat ) in Windows 2000 or XP will be interpreted as Web addresses , so either rename your batch files using the . bat extension , or launch them only via the Run box . <p> Send e-mail ; To use the Address bar or Run box to drop someone a line , just type mailto : followed by the e-mail address of your desired recipient ( for example , **26;5864;TOOLONG ) and press &lt;Enter&gt; . Your default e-mail application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's address in the " To : ' field , <p> Start a search : To search for text on the Web using Ill 's Auto-Search feature , dick the Address bar ; type find , search , go , or even just ? followed by the text to search for ; and press &lt;Enter&gt; . You can customize how the search results are displayed by choosing ToolsInternet OptionsAdvanced . Scroll to the ' Search from the Address bar ' heading . Some options may not work as expected because Microsoft occasionally changes the site that this feature is linked to . Also note that you ca n't search this way from the Run box . <p> Let Windows do the typing : As you type a folder path or URL in the Address bar or Run box , AutoComplete supplies the first folder or Web address that matches the characters as you type . To reopen folders or revisit sites , type just enough letters to get the coned path or URL to pop up . To add to this text , press &lt;Down Arrow&gt; to select the nearest match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path . Repeat as needed until you get the entire path that you want ; then press &lt;Enter&gt; . <p> Shorten shortcuts : Instead of typing paths in the Run box or Address bar , create shortcuts in the folders Windows looks in by default . In Windows 9x and Me , try the WindowsCommand folder . In Windows 2000 and XP , put the shortcuts in the WindowsSystem folder ( not WindowsSystem32 ) , since the System folder is relatively uncrowded . <p> To create the shortcuts , open Explorer and select the applications , folders , and files you use most often . Right-click and drag them to one of the aforementioned Windows folders , release the mouse button , and choose Create Shortcut(s) Here . ( You can also create shortcuts to Web pages this way . ) Give each a short name so you can launch it with little typing ; you could name your word-processor shortcut wp , for example . Do n't use the name of an existing folder , since doing so could confuse the Address bar or the Run box . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ink ( the hidden extension for shortcuts ) when you type the name of a non-Web shortcut  --  wp.ink , say . And in both the Run box and the Address bar , add . url when launching Web shortcuts  --  for example , pcw.url . If you store batch files in one of these folders , omit the . bat extension when entering file names . <p> Bypass paths : To cut down on typing even more , choose StartRun , type regedit , and press &lt;Enter&gt; . Select this folder in the left pane : HKEYLOCAL MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoft WindowsCurrent VersionApp Paths . Right-click App Paths in the right pane and choose NewKey . Type the shorthand name in the Address bar followed by . exe  --  regardless of whether you plan to launch an application or a file . For instance , type r.exe to launch a report file in a desktop publishing app . Press &lt;Enter&gt; to complete the naming . <p> Select your new shorthand key in the left pane and double-click ( Default ) in the right pane . In the Value data ' box , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file , or shortcut you want to launch . ( Add . Ink to the name of shortcut paths , and . url to the end of Web shortcuts . ) For example , type c : My DocumentsQuarterly Report.indd ( see FIGURE 4 ) . Click OK and exit the Registry Editor . Now when you enter your shorthand text ( minus the . exe ) in the Address bar or the Run box  --  such as r , to continue the example above  --  Windows will open the specified file . <p> Send Windows-related questions and tips to scottdunn@pcworld.com .

Lasky ; Dennis O'Reilly and Eric Dahl <p> WINDOWS TOOLBOX Improve Your Moves Wtih Total Copy <p> IF YOUR SYSTEM is interrupted while copying a large number of files and folders , it can be tough to tell the folders whose contents were completely copied from those that are incomplete . You have to either start over or open each folder manually to figure it out . Fortunately , a solution may be just a download away . Total Copy adds two extra commands ( Total Copy Here and Total Move Here ) to the menu you see when you drag and drop files with your right mouse button . The program automatically pauses when a problem occurs and then resumes later . It has manual pause and resume , as well as controls for adjusting the transfer speed ( handy for any quirky network connections ) . The program 's creator , Bjrn Gulliksen , claims that Total Copy works faster than Windows ' own copy function . Though it 's designed for Windows 9x and 2000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windows Me and XP .
