<p> AN epidemic is awash in the land , and Roger Clemens is its biggest victim . The major leagues have had 10 games this season that ended 1-0 , and Clemens started three of them , pitching seven shutout innings each time , then watching helplessly as his team , the Houston Astros , lost each game in extra innings . <p> Phil Garner , the Astros ' manager , watched helplessly , too . <p> " It was frustrating , " Garner said . " You hate to see good pitching wasted when you 're managing . You do n't get well-pitched games a lot of times . " <p> Not since 1992 , the year before the league added the Florida Marlins and the Colorado Rockies , have the majors had this number of similarly well-pitched games this early in the season . That year , according to research by Elias Sports Bureau , teams played a dozen 1-0 games in the equivalent period . Only three were played a year ago . In the four seasons before that , the number of 1-0 games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This season 's 10 1-0 games have been divided evenly between leagues . The Astros lost those extra-inning games to the Mets in 11 , the Braves in 12 and the Cardinals in 10 . The Padres played the other two National League games , winning both , beating the Pirates in 12 innings and the Cubs in 9 . <p> The Orioles lost two of the American League 's five games , to the Red Sox and the Blue Jays , and the Athletics and the Angels split a pair of 1-0 games , the Athletics winning in 10 innings . The White Sox beat the Indians on opening day in the season 's first 1-0 game . <p> The 1-0 games are representative of the fewer runs being scored and the fewer home runs being hit this season compared with the equivalent period last season . <p> Garner said he did n't have a ready explanation for the increase in 1-0 games , but he suggested that pitching had improved . <p> " I 've seen some pretty decently pitched games , " he said . " I predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw better-pitched games last year . " <p> An improvement in pitching would be a startling but welcome development . The quality of pitching has been declining for years , the drop-off attributed to a series of factors , including expansion , smaller parks and pitchers ' reluctance to pitch inside . But baseball developments go in cycles , and perhaps this is the beginning of a pitching cycle . <p> " A few years ago , " Garner said , " you might go a week or 10 days and see average pitching the whole time . This season we 've seen better than average pitching three , four days in a row . I 've seen some good velocity come back in the game . I 'm seeing guys with better velocity and better location , throwing more strikes . " <p> Baseball has worked the past few seasons to get more strikes into the game , instructing umpires to use the rule-book strike zone , not its shrunken cousin . But neither Garner nor Bruce Bochy , the Padres ' manager , said the strike zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've seen the strike zone go haywire again , " Garner said . " I have n't seen low and high strikes called consistently , and I 've seen pitches off the plate on both sides called strikes . " <p> Offering his viewpoint of the strike zone , Bochy said , " I have n't noticed any significant difference in the strike zone the last couple years . " <p> " The best thing I can tell you , " Bochy added , " it 's early in the season , and there have been some pitchers coming out of the gate real well . I think this is a case where you have some frontline guys doing very well at the start of the season . I think quite a few hitters have got off to a slow start . " <p> One of the frontline pitchers , Mark Mulder of St. Louis , pitched the only complete game of the 10 games , a 10-inning four-hitter against the Astros . <p> " We did n't take a very good approach against him , " Garner said of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offense generally . That 's been our problem . Our lineup is n't meshing . It 's not working . It 's not scoring runs . " <p> Besides their three 1-0 losses , the Astros lost a pair of 2-0 decisions to Pittsburgh , their five shutouts the most in the majors . <p> Transplanted Players Settle In <p> Contributions from the American League East are making an impact on the early stages of the National League West race . Two weeks apart in 2003 , Brandon Lyon and Yhency Brazoban moved from the A.L . East to the N.L. West , and they are making their marks now . <p> Lyon and Brazoban were not the major figures in the two trades , but 17 months later they are flourishing and the pitchers who were the major figures are struggling . <p> The Boston Red Sox traded Lyon and three other players to Arizona for Curt Schilling . Then the Yankees traded Brazoban and Jeff Weaver to Los Angeles for Kevin Brown . While Schilling is on the disabled list with an ankle ailment and Brown has a pitching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become effective closers . <p> Before yesterday 's games , Lyon led the majors with 11 saves and Brazoban was tied for third with 9 . Lyon was one of the primary reasons the Diamondbacks were the surprise team in the N.L. Brazoban was one of the primary reasons the Dodgers were staying up with the surprising Diamondbacks . <p> The Yankees ' trade of Brazoban to the Dodgers was only one of two critical contributions they made to his career and the Dodgers ' season . The first was the step they took with him in 2002 , his sixth minor league season , converting him from outfielder to pitcher . <p> The switch was so effective that Brazoban was in position to substitute for Eric Gagne as the Dodgers ' closer . Gagne has spent the season on the disabled list . <p> Mesa Sets a New Standard <p> Jose Mesa , still reviled in Cleveland for costing the Indians the 1997 World Series , is a hero and precedent-setter in Pittsburgh . The Pirates ' closer , Mesa earned a save in each of the team 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer . No one had gained saves in more than a team 's first five victories . <p> Mesa 's streak ended last Thursday night in the Pirates ' 6-2 victory over Arizona . <p> For Mets , Money Well Saved <p> Two years after he was expected to become the Mets ' third baseman , Norihiro Nakamura is an infield injury replacement for the Los Angeles Dodgers . Based on his early performance , the Mets should have no regrets that he changed his mind and backed out of a two-year , $6 million contract . <p> Nakamura , 31 , was hitting .128 ( 5 for 39 ) in 17 games before yesterday . His impressive offensive exploits in Japan 's Pacific League seemed well behind him . But he will most likely get more playing time to establish himself here because Jose Valentin tore knee ligaments last week and may not return until August . Valentin had replaced the departed Adrian Beltre at third . <p> The Mets thought they had a deal with Nakamura in mid-December 2002 , but he did n't arrive for the expected announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agreement had been disclosed prematurely on the Mets ' Web site . <p> He played in Japan the next two seasons , then asked for his release from a contract that had two years at about $10 million left so he could try to play in the majors in the United States . He signed a minor league contract with the Dodgers that pays him a $500,000 salary in the majors and offers an additional $250,000 in bonuses . <p> It 's Why They Have Programs <p> What 's in a name ? Sometimes confusion if the names belong to baseball players . <p> For example , if you mention Luis Gonzalez , are you talking about the Diamondbacks ' 37-year-old left fielder or the Rockies ' 25-year-old infielder ? You might be tripped up , too , if you mention a Rockies pitcher , Shawn Chacon , and instead mean Blue Jays pitcher Gustavo Chacin . <p> Do n't confuse Brian Moehler , the Marlins ' pitcher , with Chad Moeller , the Brewers ' catcher . <p> If you were talking about Jose Castillo , the Pirates ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseman ; and Alberto Castillo , the Royals ' catcher , you could easily  --  and erroneously  --  throw in Vinny Castilla , the Nationals ' third baseman . <p> These names are n't confusing , but their roles could be : Jay Gibbons , the Orioles ' first baseman , and John Gibbons , the Blue Jays ' manager . <p> Some players have the same last name and the same position , including the pitching Zambranos ( the Mets ' Victor , the Cubs ' Carlos ) , the closing Corderos ( the Rangers ' Francisco , the Nationals ' Chad ) and the relieving Wagners ( the Phillies ' Billy , the Reds ' Ryan ) . <p> Then there are the players with the same names and different positions : the Cabreras ( Angels shortstop Orlando , Marlins left fielder Miguel , Orioles pitcher Daniel ) and the Crosbys ( Athletics shortstop Bobby , the Yankees ' sometime reserve outfielder Bubba ) among them . <p> Two names are confusing for their own peculiar reasons . The Rockies ' shortstop is Clint Barmes , not Barnes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peralta . <p> " It was a birth certificate thing , " said Bart Swain , the Indians ' media relations director . " He never got it corrected . I asked him a few years ago if he wanted to change it and he said no . " <p> There was nothing confusing about a pair of Toronto pitchers ; in fact , they went together nicely  --  aptly for baseball  --  before the Blue Jays broke up their combination by sending one of them to the minor leagues . <p> Twice last month one followed the other in a game , and their names in the box scores read Bush and League , Dave Bush and Brandon League . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com Norihiro Nakamura , whom the Mets nearly signed from Japan before the 2003 season , has struggled filling in at third base for the Dodgers .
