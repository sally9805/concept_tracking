Greetings , Revered Audience . Welcome . Welcome to our show . We have a number of thrills in store for you over the next two days as our illusionists , our magicians , our sleight-of-hand artists weave their spells to delight and captivate you . Our first routine is from the repertoire of a performer everyone 's heard of : Harry Houdini , the greatest escape artist in America , if not the world , a man who performed before crowned heads of state and U.S. presidents . Some of his escapes are so difficult no one has dared attempt them , all these years after his untimely death . Today we 'll re-create an escape in which he risked suffocation in a routine known as the Lazy Hangman . In this trick , our performer lies prone on the belly , hands bound behind the back with classic Darby handcuffs . The ankles are tied together and another length of rope is wound around the neck , like a noose , and tied to the ankles . The tendency of the legs to straighten pulls the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why is it called the " Lazy " Hangman ? Because the condemned executes himself . In many of Mr. Houdini 's more dangerous routines , assistants were present with knives and keys to release him in the event that he was unable to escape . Often a doctor was on hand . Today , there 'll be none of these precautions . If there 's no escape within four minutes , the performer will die . We begin in a moment ... but first a word of advice : Never forget that by entering our show you 're abandoning reality . What you 're absolutelyconvinced you see might not exist at all . What you know has to be an illusion may turn out to be God 's harsh truth . Your companion at our show might turn out to be a total stranger . A man or woman in the audience you do n't recognize may know you far too well . What seems safe may be deadly . And the dangers you guard against may be nothing more than distractions to lure you to greater danger . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust ? Well , Revered Audience , the answer is that you should believe nothing . And you should trust no one . No one at all . Now , the curtain rises , the lights dim , the music fades , leaving only the sublime sound of hearts beating in anticipation . And our show begins .... The building looked as if it 'd seen its share of ghosts . Gothic , sooty , dark . Sandwiched between two high-rises on the Upper West Side , capped with a widow 's walk and many shuttered windows . The building dated from the Victorian era and had been a boarding school at one point and later a sanatorium , where the criminally insane lived out their frazzled lives . The Manhattan School of Music and Performing Arts could have been home to dozens of spirits . But none so immediate as the one who might be hovering here now , above the warm body of the young woman lying , stomach down , in the dim lobby outside a small recital hall . Her eyes were still and wide but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet brown . Her face was dark as plum from the constriction of the taut rope connecting her neck to her ankles . Scattered around her were a flute case , sheet music and a spilled grande cup from Starbucks , the coffee staining her jeans and green Izod shirt and leaving a comma of dark liquid on the marble floor . Also present was the man who 'd killed her , bending down and examining her carefully . He was taking his time and felt no urge to rush . Today was Saturday , the hour early . There were no classes in the school on the weekends , he 'd learned . Students did use the practice rooms but they were in a different wing of the building . He leaned closer to the woman , squinting , wondering if he could see some essence , some spirit rising from her body . He did n't . He straightened up , considering what else he might do to the still form in front of him . " You 're sure it was screaming ? " " Yeah .... No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming , you know . Shouting . Upset . For just a second or two . Then it stopped . " Officer Diane Franciscovich , a portable working out of the Twentieth Precinct , continued , " Anybody else hear anything ? " The heavy guard , breathing hard , glanced at the tall , brunette policewoman , shook his head and flexed and opened his huge hands . He wiped his dark palms on his blue slacks . " Call for backup ? " asked Nancy Ausonio , another young patrol officer , shorter than her partner , blonde . Franciscovich did n't think so , though she was n't sure . Portables walking the beat in this part of the Upper West Side dealt mostly with traffic accidents , shoplifting and car theft ( as well as holding the hands of distraught muggees ) . This was a first for them  --  the two women officers , on their Saturday morning watch , had been spotted on the sidewalk and motioned urgently inside by the guard to help check out the screaming . Well , upset shouting . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " See what 's going on . " The guard said , " Sounded like it was comin ' from ' round here somewhere . Du n no . " " Spooky place , " Ausonio offered , oddly uneasy ; she was the partner most likely to leap into the middle of a dispute , even if it involved combatants twice her size . " The sounds , you know . Hard to tell . You know what I 'm sayin ' ? Where they 're coming from . " Franciscovich was focusing on what her partner had said . Damn spooky place , she added silently . Seeming miles of dim corridors later , finding nothing out of the ordinary , the security guard paused . Franciscovich nodded to a doorway in front of them . " What 's through here ? " " Be no reason for students t'be there . It 's only  --  " Franciscovich pushed the door open . Inside was a small lobby that led to a door labeled Recital Hall A. And near that door was the body of a young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cuffs . Eyes open in death . A brown-haired , bearded man in his early fifties crouched over her . He looked up , surprised at their entry . " No ! " Ausonio cried . " Oh , Christ , " the guard gasped . The officers drew their weapons and Franciscovich sighted down on the man with what she thought was a surprisingly steady hand . " You , do n't move ! Stand up slow , move away from her and put your hands in the air . " Her voice was much less firm than the fingers gripping the Glock pistol . The man did as he was told . " Lie face down on floor . Keep your hands in sight ! " Ausonio started forward to the girl . It was then Franciscovich noticed that the man 's right hand , over his head , was closed in a fist . " Open your  --  " Pop ... She went blind as a flash of searing light filled the room . It seemed to come directly from the suspect 's hand and hovered for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into a crouch , scrabbling backward and squinting , swinging the gun back and forth . Panicked , she knew the killer had kept his eyes shut when the flash went off and would be aiming his own weapon at them or charging forward with a knife . " Where , where , where ? " she shouted . Then she saw  --  vaguely thanks to her frizzled vision and the dissipating smoke  --  the killer running into the recital hall . He slammed the door shut . There was a thud inside as he moved a chair or table against the door . Ausonio dropped to her knees in front of the girl . With a Swiss army knife she cut the rope off her neck , rolled her over and , using a disposable mouthpiece , started CPR . " Any other exits ? " Franciscovich shouted to the guard . " Only one  --  in the back , around the corner . To the right . " " Windows ? " " No . " " Hey , " she called to Ausonio as she started sprinting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the blonde officer called and blew another breath into the victim 's pale lips . More thuds from inside as the killer beefed up his barricade ; Franciscovich sprinted around the corner , toward the door the guard had told them about , calling for backup on her Motorola . As she looked ahead she saw someone standing at the end of the corridor . Franciscovich stopped fast , drew a target on the man 's chest and shone the brilliant beam from her halogen flashlight on him . " Lord , " croaked the elderly janitor , dropping the broom he held . Franciscovich thanked God she 'd kept her finger outside the trigger guard of the Glock . " You see somebody come out of that door ? " " What 's going on ? " " You see anybody ? " Franciscovich shouted . " No , ma'am . " " How long you been here ? " " I do n't know . Ten minutes , I 'd guess . " There was another thud of furniture from inside as the killer continued to blockade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridor with the security guard then eased up to the side door . Gun held high , eye level , she tested the knob gently . It was unlocked . She stepped to the side so she would n't be in the line of fire if the perp shot through the wood . A trick she remembered from NYPD Blue , though an instructor might 've mentioned it at the Academy too . Another thump from inside . " Nancy , you there ? " Franciscovich whispered into her handy-talkie . Ausonio 's voice , shaky , said , " She 's dead , Diane . I tried . But she 's dead . " " He did n't get out this way . He 's still inside . I can hear him . " Silence . " I tried , Diane . I tried . " " Forget it . Come on . You on this ? You on it ? " " Yeah , I 'm cool . Really . " The officer 's voice hardened . " Let 's go get him . " " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ESU gets here . That 's all we 've got to do . Sit tight . Stay clear of the door . And sit tight . " Which is when she heard the man shout from inside , " I 've got a hostage . I 've got a girl in here . Try to get in and I 'll kill her ! " Oh , Jesus ... " You , inside ! " Franciscovich shouted . " Nobody 's going to do anything . Do n't worry . Just do n't hurt anybody else . " Was this procedure ? she wondered . Neither prime-time television nor her Academy training was any help here . She heard Ausonio call Central and report that the situation was now a barricade and hostage-taking . Franciscovich called to the killer , " Just take it easy ! You can  --  " A huge gunshot from inside . Franciscovich jumped like a fish . " What happened ? Was that you ? " she shouted into her radio . " No , " her partner replied , " I thought it was you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yeah . He said he 's got a hostage . You think he shot her ? " " I do n't know . How do I know ? " Franciscovich , thinking : Where the hell is the backup ? " Diane , " Ausonio whispered after a moment . " We 've got ta go in . Maybe she 's hurt . Maybe she 's wounded . " Then , shouting : " You , inside ! " No answer . " You ! " Nothing . " Maybe he killed himself , " Franciscovich offered . Or maybe he fired the shot to make us think he 'd killed himself and he 's waiting inside , drawing a target gut high on the doorway . Then that terrible image returned to her : the seedy door to the recital lobby opening , casting the pale light on the victim , her face blue and cold as winter dusk . Stopping people from doing things like this was why she 'd become a cop in the first place . " We have to go in , Diane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm thinking . Okay . We 'll go in . " Speaking a bit manically as she thought of both her family and how to curl her left hand over her right when firing an automatic pistol in a combat shooting situation . " Tell the guard we 'll need lights inside the hall . " A moment later Ausonio said , " The switch is out here . He 'll turn ' em on when I say so . " A deep breath that Franciscovich heard through the microphone . Then Ausonio said , " Ready . On three . You count it . " " Okay . One ... Wait . I 'll be coming in from your two o'clock . Do n't shoot me . " " Okay . Two o'clock . I 'll be  --  " " You 'll be on my left . " " Go ahead . " " One . " Franciscovich gripped the knob with her left hand . " Two . " This time her finger slipped inside the guard of her weapon , gently caressing the second trigger  --  the safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so loud that she was sure her partner heard the call without the radio . She shoved through the doorway into the large rectangular room just as the glaring lights came on . " Freeze ! " she screamed  --  to an empty room . Crouching , skin humming with the tension , she swung her weapon from side to side as she scanned every inch of the space . No sign of the killer , no sign of a hostage . A glance to her left , the other doorway , where Nancy Ausonio stood , doing the same frantic scan of the room . " Where ? " the woman whispered . Franciscovich shook her head . She noticed about fifty wooden folding chairs arranged in neat rows . Four or five of them were lying on their backs or sides . But they did n't seem to be a barricade ; they were randomly kicked over . To her right was a low stage . On it sat an amplifier and two speakers . A battered grand piano . The young officers could see virtually everything in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nancy ? Tell me what happened . " Ausonio did n't answer ; like her partner she was looking around frantically , three-sixty , checking out every shadow , every piece of furniture , even though it was clear the man was n't here . Spooky ... The room was essentially a sealed cube . No windows . The air-conditioning and heating vents were only six inches across . A wooden ceiling , not acoustic tile . No trapdoors that she could see . No doors other than the main one Ausonio had used and the fire door that Franciscovich had entered through . Where ? Franciscovich mouthed . Her partner mouthed something back . The policewoman could n't decipher it but the message could be read in her face : I do n't have a clue . " Yo , " a loud voice called from the doorway . They spun toward it , drawing targets on the empty lobby . " Ambulance and some other officers just got here . " It was the security guard , hiding out of sight . Heart slamming from the fright , Franciscovich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , uhm ... I mean , you get him ? " " He 's not here , " Ausonio said in a shaky voice . " What ? " The man peeked cautiously into the hall . Franciscovich heard the voices of the officers and EMS techs arriving . The jangle of equipment . Still , the women could n't bring themselves to join their fellow cops just yet . They stood transfixed in the middle of the recital space , both uneasy and bewildered , trying vainly to figure out how the killer had escaped from a room from which there was no escape .
