Captain Chris Johnson is ready to roll . He is sitting in his armored humvee at the gate of a U.S. military compound in Baghdad , preparing to head out onto Haifa Street , a haven for insurgents and one of the most dangerous districts in Baghdad . Johnson is n't fully certain where he 's heading , so he reaches for a handheld radio slung from his body armor and clicks the hand mike . " Colonel , is everybody going to Gator Base ? " A voice crackles back : " Yes . " It 's a routine exchange , save for one thing : the voice of Johnson 's convoy commander belongs not to an American but to Colonel Mohammed Faiq Raouf , a former officer in Saddam Hussein 's army who shot down a U.S. jet during the first Gulf War . Johnson and his small team of U.S. soldiers are serving under Raouf 's command . Having received his direction , Johnson radios back to Raouf . " I 'm ready , Colonel , " he says . <P> If U.S. war planners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonplace . With a new Iraqi government settling into office , Washington is in a rush to train an Iraqi army capable of taking over the fight against the insurgency . And it 's still a fight . Though senior Pentagon officials are " cautiously optimistic , " as one puts it , that the insurgency may be starting to subside , few think the war is close to being won . The Pentagon 's measures of the insurgency 's strength  --  there are more than 50 metrics  --  show that the battle is basically where it was a year ago . For every hint of good news in Iraq , there 's still cause for concern . The number of attacks against U.S. and Iraqi forces is hovering around 30 to 40 a day , down from a spike of 140 in the days leading up to the Jan. 30 election . But a senior Pentagon official does n't know whether the lower number amounts to a trend or only a lull . " It could just as well go up next week , " he says . The ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week by the kidnapping of a U.S. contractor and a rash of suicide bombings ; 19 Iraqis were killed in a single day . <P> Given the level of violence , the number of U.S. troops in Iraq  --  currently 138,000 in 17 combat brigades  --  wo n't come down in the foreseeable future . And the Bush Administration insists it 's prepared to keep forces in Iraq until the country is pacified . " We do n't have an exit strategy , " Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said during a surprise visit to Baghdad last week . " We have a victory strategy . " But behind the scenes , military planners in Iraq are putting in place a program that provides a glimpse of the future of the counterinsurgency . As the bulk of U.S. troops retreats from the front lines , small groups of military advisers  --  like Captain Johnson 's 12-man team  --  will form partnerships with Iraqi units fresh out of boot camp , sharing their barracks and accompanying them on missions but allowing the Iraqis to command themselves .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
