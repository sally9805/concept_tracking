Chapter One Welcome It was a perfect day in Mrs. Wagner 's garden . The garden was dazzling in its new spring colors . Under a clear sky of robin's-egg blue , the trees wore leaves of fresh emerald green , and flowers bloomed in every color of the rainbow . Ashley lived next door to Mrs. Wagner and often stopped by to visit . The two had become great friends . Most Saturdays you could find them sipping raspberry tea on the patio as they watched their furry , feathered and buzzing friends take delight in the garden . Mrs. Wagner said the garden was their playground . The bunnies tumbled through the clover and played hide-and-seek under the periwinkle . The squirrels leapt from tree to tree , impressing Mrs. Wagner and Ashley with their athletic prowess . The birds sang beautiful cantatas as they cheerfully played in the fountain . Ashley and Mrs. Wagner could n't help but smile . Ashley especially enjoyed the bumble bees . She found it remarkable how they tirelessly danced from flower to flower collecting pollen and nectar . Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After tea , Mrs. Wagner asked Ashley if she would pot some flowers to decorate the patio . " I do n't know ! " Ashley said with a gasp . " I-I do n't think I can . I mean , your garden is so beautiful . Icould never make something so pretty . And what if I ruin the flowers ? " " Oh honey , that 's just silly , " said Mrs. Wagner . " Of course you can do it . You 've helped me so many times , I 'm sure you know just what to do . " Now , I have a few chores to take care of inside . I 'll be back to check on you in a while . " With that , Mrs. Wagner picked up the tea set and went into the house , leaving Ashley with the pots and flowers . Although Ashley usually knew what to do , now that she was alone she doubted her memory . How much dirt should she use in each pot ? How hard was she supposed to pack it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , why had n't she paid more attention ? She wanted to cry out of frustration . " I 'll just make a mess of it . I 'm no good at anything ! " " Tsk , tsk , " she heard a sweet voice say . Turning , she hoped to find Mrs. Wagner coming to relieve her from this impossible task . But Mrs. Wagner was nowhere around . " Who 's there ? " Ashley cried out . " Calm down , " said the voice . " I 'm over here . " " Where ? " asked Ashley . " I do n't see anyone . " " Over here on the butterfly bush , " the voice answered . Ashley moved closer to the flowering shrub and inspected it closely . There she saw a bumble bee . " Good morning ! " said the bee . Ashley had to sit down to keep from falling over in shock . " A bee . I 'm chatting with a bee , " she said in disbelief . " Exactly ! " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a bumble bee ! " " I do n't mean to be rude , Miss Ashley , but I could n't help overhearing your dilemma . " " I 've seen you in the garden many times . I know Mrs. Wagner would n't ask you to do anything you 're not capable of . " Still in shock , Ashley somehow managed to remember her manners , and she asked the bee its name . " I 'm Ruby Lee . Ruby Lee the Bumble Bee ! " Ashley looked closely at Ruby Lee . She was a beautiful specimen . Dressed in fuzzy yellow and black , her little round body seemed huge under its dainty silver wings . Her big , bee eyes were bright and friendly , and her cheeks were ruby-red - like her name . Her smile was as sweet as honey . Just looking at her made Ashley feel better , and for a time she forgot she was speaking with a bumble bee . " Now , Miss Ashley , is there any reason you could n't pot those flowers for Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Ashley , " I 'm not good at anything . What if I break a pot ? What if I ruin her beautiful flowers ? What if- " " Enough ! " said Ruby Lee . " Life is full of challenges . It 's up to us to turn every challenge into an opportunity . We bees learn this very early on . " " For example , did you know that bumble bees are n't able to fly ? " asked Ruby Lee . " What do you mean ? " asked Ashley with a puzzled look . " I know you can fly - I 've seen you ! " " Well , of course we do fly , but technically we 're not supposed to be able to , " explained the bee . " Huh ? " responded Ashley . " Scientifically speaking , our bodies are far too big for our little wings . We should n't be able to fly . " " That 's amazing , " said Ashley . " Yes , it is , " agreed Ruby Lee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all His creatures with special gifts . And though at times things seem impossible , we can accomplish amazing things if we trust God and believe in ourselves , " explained Ruby Lee . " Of course you can pot those flowers for Mrs. Wagner . You are a talented and bright young lady ! I 'll sit here with you while you work , " said Ashley 's tiny new friend . After pondering the wise words of Ruby Lee the Bumble Bee , Ashley was inspired . She scooped potting soil into each pot , then selected the flowers she thought prettiest . As she set each plant on top of the soil , she held it gently so the roots would n't be damaged . Gradually , she remembered everything that Mrs. Wagner had shown her . She and Ruby Lee had a wonderful time chatting while Ashley worked . With each pot , Ashley gained more confidence . In the end , only one pot suffered a minor chip , and the flowers were beautiful ! " Well done ! " exclaimed Ruby Lee . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her heart was filled with pride . She had done it ! At that moment , Mrs. Wagner returned to the garden . " Oh Ashley , what a wonderful job ! I knew you could do it . " As Mrs. Wagner and Ashley arranged the pots around the patio , Ruby Lee hovered close by . " Mrs. Wagner ? " asked Ashley . " Did you know that bumble bees are n't able to fly ? " " Well yes , Ashley , I do know that . My mother told me the story many years ago , when I was just about your age " . " She said that when God made the bumble bee , it should n't have been able to fly , but God whispered in its ear , ' You can do it . ' The bee trusted Him , and so it flew . " " Perhaps God made the bumble bee to show us that anything is possible if we trust in Him and believe in ourselves , " said Mrs. Wagner . At that moment , Ruby Lee flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " bee-lieve ! " And with that , the wise little bee flew off into the garden , doing a few loop-the-loops . Just because she could .
