Like trucker caps and Uggs , custom ring tones are so ubiquitous , they 're practically pass . If you really want to impress , get a ring-back tone . When someone calls you , the ringing sound the caller hears is replaced by a tune from Alicia Keys , Santana or another artist . TMobile launched the first nationwide service Dec. 8 with about 400 $1.99 music clips . You must be a TMobile customer to buy the tunes , but anyone who calls you will hear them .  --  By Anita Hamilton
