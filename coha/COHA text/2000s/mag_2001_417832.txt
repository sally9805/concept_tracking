Serving in the military THE QUANTITY of responses to my article " Soldiering " ( July 4-11 ) was gratifying , as my central goal was to precipitate dialogue on the question of voluntary military service ( see Letters , Aug. 15-22 ) . Yet few of the responses grapple with the core of the argument . My focus was on the moral status of the individual decision to serve in the military . I did not intend to address the policies of the National Command Authority , but to take the perspective of the individual service member who serves policies he or she did not design ( and which are certainly open to question ) . Clyde Carter and Ryan Ahlgrim both appear to assert biblicist pacifism as a complete and sufficient answer . This is a position for which I believe every Christian must give deep respect-at least if one grants , as I do , that it reflects the dominant view of the New Testament and the early church . And when , as with Ahlgrim 's Mennonite tradition , the full implications of withdrawal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tradition bears witness to a moral and religious consistency one can not fail to honor . But the later majority tradition moved away from this stance in favor of accepting worldly responsibility and the accompanying moral ambiguity . I would assert that once it was no longer an oppressed and powerless community , Christianity expanded its internal moral logic to a wider understanding of the possibilities and limitations of worldly power , properly used . The decision to engage the world or withdraw from it as far as possible is , I grant , the deepest one in Christian political ethics . Merlin Ackerson 's assertion that I believe " that our country has only the best of motives when it comes to using our military force " made me wonder whether he 'd read the piece with much care . If one takes a sufficiently Augustinian view of the world to think through the kinds of issues I 've raised , the idea of pure " best of motives " ceases to have much meaning . Motives are always mixed ; actors are always imperfect ; moral choice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it is not sectarian , has the intellectual and moral resources to cope with those shades of gray . The most I affirmed is that soldiers must believe that their leaders are not moral monsters and fools . Paul Parker grasps one of mv central points when he acknowledges the reality of American power underlying the international political system wherever one goes , whatever one chooses to do . But he appears to imagine some utopian fantasy world in which there is n't some power maintaining world order . On that basis , he says , we should oppose American war . All such wars ? Regardless of their effect on world stability ? In favor of what ? None of the responses reacted to my discusson of coalition and UN uses of force for humanitarian ends . As I write this , C-130s are landing in Macedonia in hopes of stopping slaughter , and thousands of NATO soldiers are in Bosnia and Kosovo . UN troops maintain a fragile peace in Sierra Leone . It is obvious that , if they were withdrawn tomorrow , the human cost would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from their families in tough environments . They are effective precisely because they are very well armed , very well trained and act under " robust rules of engagement . " Most of the respondents appear to presume that our men and women in uniform are " nothing more than mindless , professional killers . " Clearly , some serious moral dialogue needs to occur . The yawning gulf of mutual mistrust and misunderstanding is graphically illustrated by most of these responses . Martin L. Cook Carlisle , Pa . Clergy income ... AS A MINISTER who has served congregations for 40 years , I 'd like to add a couple of concerns to the mix that Matthew Price has presented ( " Fear of falling , " Aug. 15-22 ) . First , some students complete seminary saddled by a substantial debt . I was the beneficiary of a virtually free seminary education and generous scholarship help . Today , young graduates have borrowed money for seminary and have substantial " start-up " expenses not covered by any other source . The burden of student loan debt can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of service . Marriage , the birth of children , the need to purchase office equipment not supplied by smaller churches , autos-all these make it hard to stretch modest salaries . Church governing bodies can and do help with educational costs , but can seldom mitigate personal debt . Second , the obligation to pay selfemployment Social Security dues on the basis of cash salary and the value of church-provided housing or housing allowances can be a painful surprise to an ordinand . Speaking personally , the fact that I lived for almost 20 years in a large , beautiful house provided " tax free " did not alter the fact that I had to pay thousands of dollars annually to satisfy my Social Security obligation . Younger ministers are sometimes not aware of this particular expense and may fail to provide for it during the first year of service .

Seminaries could offer a required course in financial and tax management and the operation of a pastoral " practice . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewards of the " genteel poverty " that is so admired by parishioners who note the frugal lifestyles of their poorly paid clergy . Finally , church-governing bodies must take a hard look at , and make some difficult decisions about , the small congregations that desire to have a full-time pastor at minimum cost . Lawton W Posey Charleston , W Va . Denominations have conjured up a bewildering array of rules , regulations , criteria and formulas that govern clergy compensation . Other than the American Guild of Organists , salaries in no other profession are so highly regulated . These guidelines have a powerful influence in limiting clergy compensation . As Matthew Price accurately noted , about the only way for clergy to increase their salary is to move to a " higher steeple " church . Almost unheard-of in the guidelines is encouragement to smaller churches to pay beyond recommended salary levels to retain a younger or beloved pastor . The guidelines also reflect the attitude that since membership and overall income may be declining and money is scarce , ministers should not expect much . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long enough a time , they come to believe they really are n't worth much more . As a church consultant , I work with lay leaders who are remarkably capable . Some of them make decisions involving tens of millions of dollars in their jobs . Ca n't they figure out the minister 's salary on their own ? Why should lay leaders in California have to call someone in New York or Boston to find out how much to pay the minister ? A much better guide to clergy compensation is the median household or median family income in one 's local community . This figure is available at public libraries , chambers of commerce or banks . The median income , the mid-point of salaries in the community , is usually considered " what it takes " to live in town . The latest median income figures from the 2000 census are not yet available . I suspect , however , that many churches pay their ministers below the median income based on 1990 figures . Poverty in the ministry is not virtuous . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all other aspects of church life . This is a debilitating formula for churches , ministers , and everyone in the pews alike . Michael Durall Belmont , Mass . What have I given up to be a minister ? My great-grandfather was an indentured servant who became a North Carolina farmer . He sent many of his 12 children to college even though it meant taking out loans on his land . My grandfather who did not go to college sent his two children to undergraduate school and one on to medical school . My father sent both his children through undergraduate school and me on to seminary . It was passed along to me that the first duty of parents is to support their families and educate their children . The church deprived me of that . It has been my parents ' money that sent my children through school . I simply would like the ability to provide for my children . Patricia Hunt Staunton , Va . Matthew Price refers to churches 11 creating a few well-endowed livings for ambitious pastors , and a mass of poorly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose both categories fit me , although I never considered myself " ambitious . " I did move five times , however , to support my family by increasing my salary . Now I have begun an adequate pension . With the help of my wife 's employment , I can work with several small churches in Western Massachusetts . ( In the Berkshire Association of the United Church of Christ , only ten out of 25 churches can afford full-time clergy . ) These churches need good leadership , but I am not convinced it needs to be " professional . " It seems to me that full-time professional ministry should no longer be normative in mainline churches . Instead , why not raise up the dignity of " bi-vocationality , " using the apostle Paul as a model ? And why not aggressively seek to equip the spirit-filled laymen and laywomen who are the leaders in our churches ? John G. Wightman Sheffield , Mass . The thought that God 's work should be done for little remuneration because God " calls " the clergy is to suggest doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not called by God . Thus , it diminishes the work of all the people . Further , in a recent article about clerk health-care benefits in the United Church News , a local church treasurer who administers benefits for a large firm said , " If we saw another organization treating its employees the way we treat ours , we 'd be outside picketing them . " Indeed , the economic viability of any worker is an issue of social justice . Joseph Connolly Norwich , MY We did n't enter this calling in order to get rich , but I have the temerity to believe that we are professionals in the root meaning of the term , which is to profess a truth . To define it according to money alone is to give in to the worst of our society 's idolatries . Ralph E. Nelson Shepherd of the Hills Presbyterian Church , Casper , Wyo . Postliberal theology ... READING Gary Dorrien 's two articles on postliberal theology ( July 4-11 , 18-25 ) makes one wonder whether it is possible to do theology that is serviceable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part to excessive compacting . The articles are not simply informative ; they are also an expression of strong personal opinion . The quasi-sacramental Barthian approach to the Bible , calling us to receive the Bible as the word of God , sounds good but will in fact be good only on condition of engaging each biblical text in its specificity . The characterization of God runs from the too frequent places where God is shown as an indiscriminate mass killer ( the flood , the Egyptian firstborn , Revelation , etc. ) to the texts that give us access to Jesus in action , spreading his low-profile good news of a life-giving God who seeks theoethical responses . This radical ambiguity excludes simple reception and instead demands active discernment via mental and ethical alertness . Without this respect for the text , this basic honesty , this " yes yes " and " no no , " language about hearing the Bible as the word of God is dangerously misleading .

Postliberal theologies may presage the return of the middle way . But fascinating as their epistemological wonderings may be , postliberal accounts of the truth of Christianity will make little Christian difference unless they lay the foundation for a robust , confident and persuasive Christology , for which we still wait . Patrick J. Nugent Institute for Quaker Studies , Richmond , Ind . It disturbs me to read that Stanley Hauerwas considers himself " a historicist all the way down " in apparent contrast to James Gustafson , who , like Ernst Troeltsch , wants " to find a place to name history outside history " ( " Truth claims , " by Gary Dorrien , July 18-25 ) . Where in Gustafson 's writings does one ever find such a claim ? No one is more cognizant than Gustafson that there is no place outside history from which to interpret history ! Moreover , to claim that Troeltsch thought it possible to do so is also a gross misreading . The entire point of Troeltsch 's lifework was to deny what Hauerwas wants to attribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to be " a historicist all the way down " means adopting a stance of epistemological humility , not absolutistic dogmatism . And one more thing : to say that " Gustafson never enters into argument with Barth " is ridiculous . Barth is one of the major figures in the Christian tradition on whose writings Gustafson cut his theological teeth . Any reader of Gustafson can see how evident is the deep influence of Barth and that , yes , Gustafson does give reasons for his departures from Barth . The most disturbing thing about these remarks for me is that they are made by a reputable theologian teaching at a major university , even though his comments are patently false to the textual evidence . How does he get away with this ? Given his claim to be faithful to the tradition of the Bible , I suggest he remind himself of this verse : " Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor . " Paul Capetz New Brighton , Minn . Film failure ... JAMES WALL puts the most positive spin possible on Steven Spielberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he does not persuade me that A. I. actually delivers a worthwhile message ( " Search for love , " July 18-25 ) . Wall says we will be trapped if we take the film literally . Of course , we ca n't stay at the surface level of any work of art . The characters and plot point to deeper meanings . But if you do n't start with the literal story and take it seriously in a film , play or novel , you are reduced to your own subjective interpretation . You impose whatever meaning suits you , producing a work of art that exists in your head but has little to do with the actual artist 's work . The surface message of A. I. is that robots are capable of nobility and beauty-e.g. , young David-or at least sexual attractiveness-e.g. , Gigolo Joe . Humans , however , are uniformly violent , exploitative , amoral , disgusting and generally stupid . This is seen most clearly in the vulgar crowd that gathers to watch robots being destroyed . Spielberg combines the worst features of crowds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other human characters are also repulsive : the amoral inventor , the neurotic mother who abandons David , the woman 's biological son who is pretty near diabolic , the crass father using the robot child for his selfish purposes . There is a question posed at the beginning about the morality of creating a being programmed for love who can not change while the humans are very changeable . It is a question that no one answers . So this film becomes the story of David 's massive Oedipal complex worked out over a period of thousands of years . At the end , the robots have indeed taken over the world . David 's mother is then brought back for a day ; he experiences her love . She dies and he lies beside her for eternity . Spielberg has the music swell to tell us this is a happy ending . But I know several people , including myself , who left this dark parable disturbed . On a second viewing I realized how misanthropic this film is . The human race dies , and the film celebrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race will perish , robots will survive , and this is the way it should be . Thought-provoking and superbly made though it is , this film is a failure . Roland Calvert Adrian Dominican Motherhouse , Adrian , Mich . <p>
