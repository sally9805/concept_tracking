I guess I can reveal the bet now between Retief Goosen and me at the U.S. Open , since I have n't paid him yet . It was just a $5 bet . Retief said something to me like , " Do you know the game of cricket ? " I said , " Yeah , a little bit . " He said , " That 's the only thing we 're having right now , a good game of cricket , since we 're having so many overs . " And I said , " Well , heck , you want to play for $5 on the way in ? " I turn around and he 's laughing . He won the bet because I doubled the last hole for an 84 . I do n't know why the fans have taken to me so much . Maybe it 's the whole underdog thing . They can relate . I just have a lot of fun when I 'm playing . Maybe the fans at the U.S. Open saw how I was having a good time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the bigger crowds . We 're all kind of sicko hot dogs in that way . The fans are awesome . You get a little down and they yell , " C'm on , Gore ! PBR ! " That 's a cool feeling . During the U.S. Open , someone was always yelling PBR , because my caddie , Lewis Puller , wore a Pabst Blue Ribbon hat . They 'd yell , " PBR me ASAP , " just like the old Pabst ads . That was pretty funny . Confidence is what I took out of the U.S. Open . Any time you get on the biggest stage and perform well , it 's definitely a confidence booster . To know that I could play in the final group on Sunday of a major , that was huge for me . Shooting 59 like I did on the Nationwide Tour , that was unexpected . I had to make a 20-footer for eagle on the last hole to shoot 59 . I told everybody I did n't know it was for 59 , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sucker for drama . I played with Tiger a lot during my junior days . We roomed together at the Canon Cup one year , and when he walked out in his glasses for the first time , he looked like Urkel with those big , thick shades on . I was like , " Dude , oh my God ! " He 's like , " Shhhhh , do n't tell anyone . " It took awhile for me to become myself again after my father passed away in 1997 . I just used his death as an excuse for how I played . It was an easy way out . I did n't think anything really affected me , but I always had a way of saying , " Well , my dad just died . " It was a big excuse . It 's life . It 's horrible , but it happens . I started playing guitar just by listening to the Dave Matthews Band . One year for my birthday my wife , Megan , surprised me and got me backstage at one of the band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I pounded about six of them with Dave . I was like , " Hey , you 've got to come out and play in the AT &T; Pebble Beach National Pro-Am with me . " I guess the whole band plays golf . John Daly and I have jammed together a little bit . John thinks he 's really good , and he 's OK . I think I 'm OK and I 'm really bad . What one song would best sum up my recent journey ? Bon Jovi 's " Livin " on a Prayer " laughs .
