Every village has its rhythm , and every year Templeton 's was the same . Summer meant tourists to the baseball museum , the crawl of traffic down Main Street , even a drunken soprano flinging an aria into the night on her stagger back to the Opera . With fall , the tourists thinned out , and the families of Phillies Phanatics ceded the town to retired couples with binoculars , there to watch the hills run riot with color . <p> Come winter , Templeton hunkered into itself . We natives were so grateful for this quiet-when we could hear the sleigh bells at the Farmer 's Museum all the way to the Susquehanna-that we almost did n't mind the shops closing up . It was in winter that we believed in our own virtue , when we lauded ourselves for being the kind of people to renounce the comforts of city life for a tight community and spectacular beauty . We packed on our winter fat and waited for spring , for the lake to melt , for the cherry blossoms , for the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crescendo of tourists . <p> This was our rhythm , at least , until the Lucky Chow Fun girls . That year , the snow did n't melt until mid-May , and the Templeton High School Boys ' Swim Team won the State Championships . That year , we natives stopped looking one another in the eye . <p> I was seventeen that spring and filled with longing , which I tried to sate with the books of myth and folklore that I was devouring by the dozens . I could n't read enough of the stories , tiny doors that opened only to reveal a place I had n't known I 'd known ; stories so old they felt ingrained into my genes . I loved Medea , Isolde , Allerleirauh . I imagined myself as a beautiful Cassandra , wandering vast and lonely halls , spilling prophesies that everyone laughed at , only to watch come tragically true in the end . This feeling of mutedness , of injustice , was particularly strong in me , though I had no particular prophesies to tell , no clear-sighted warnings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamt of college , being pumped full of all the old knowledge until I knew everything there was to know , all the past cultures picked clean like delicious roasted chickens . <p> All March , I skidded home from school as fast as I could in my ratty Honda Civic to look for my college acceptance letters in the mailbox ; all of my friends had gotten early acceptances , but because I was recruited for swimming , I had to wait for the regular acceptances . All March , there was nothing . By the time my little sister , Petra-Pot-trudged the mile home over the snowdrifts , I would be sitting at the kitchen table , having just eaten an entire box of cereal plus a bowl of ice cream , feeling sick . <p> " Oh , God , Lollie , " she 'd say , dumping her backpack . " Nothing ? " <p> " Nope , " I 'd say . " Nothing . " <p> And she 'd sigh and sit across from me . Her days were also hard , as she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too spastic . She never once had a sleepover or even a best friend . But instead of complaining , Pot would try to cheer me up by mimicking the new birdsongs she 'd learned that day . " Drop-it , drop-it , cover-it-up , cover-it-up , pull-it-up , pull-it-up , " she 'd sing , then say , " Brown Thrasher , " her dumpling face suddenly luminous . That year , Pot was on a strange ornithological kick , as if her entire pudgy being were stuffed with feathers . She fell asleep to tapes of tweets and whistles and had a growing collection of taxidermied birds scattered around her bedroom . I had no idea where she had gotten them , but was too moony with my own troubles to ask . I avoided her room as much as possible , because she had one particular gyrfalcon perched on her dresser that seemed malicious , if not downright evil , ready to scratch at your jugular if you were to saunter innocently by . <p> Those melancholy afternoons , Pot would chirp away until my mother came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Van Hornesville , where she taught biology . No : my mother never came in , she blew in like the dust devil of a woman she was , stomping the snow off her boots , sending great clouds of it from her shoulders . " Oh , God , Lollie , nothing ? " she would say , releasing her springy gray hair from her cap . <p> " Nothing , " Pot would trill , then leap up to rejoin her stiff little aviary upstairs . <p> My mother would look at the wreckage of my snack , frown , and hug me . " Elizabeth , " she 'd say , and I could hear the vibration of her words in her chest , feel the press of each individual bone of her rib cage . " Do n't you worry . It will all work out in the end . You 're no Podunk idiot like the kids I teach- " <p> " Spare me , " I 'd interrupt , and give her a kiss on the chin . Then I 'd stand , late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to peep out the window at me as I pulled away . That spring she was dating The Garbageman , and when I came home I may have seen her before going to bed , or I may not have seen her until morning , singing during her preparations for school . <p> There are hundreds of versions of the Cinderella story throughout the world : Serbian Pepelyouga , Norwegian Kari Trestakk , Chinese Yeh-hsien , German Aschenputtel , French Cendrillon . What most of the stories have in common is both an absent good mother and an evil present one . Fairy tales are not like real life in all its beautiful ambiguity . There are no semi-good semi-absent mothers . Or , for that matter , semi-present very good ones . <p> It was only in the pool that winter , feeling the thrust and slide of my body through the water , that I felt good . Only then could I escape the niggling terror of what would happen to my mother and sister when I left them , the image of their sad dinners , my sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crap day she had at school , neither heard by the other , neither listening . <p> I was the captain and the only girl on the varsity boys ' swim team that year , though not much of a leader . During the long bus rides , I only giggled nervously at the boys ' boasts about boning chicks I knew they never touched . I was n't chosen as a captain because I was a leader , but rather because of my teammates ' small town gallantry and my minor celebrity as an oddity in the papers . I was the fastest butterflier around , and could beat everyone , boy or girl , in the region , save for one lightning-swift boy from Glens Falls . The papers all the way to Albany could n't stop chortling over this fact . They ran photos of me every week , careful to only take my fairly pretty face and leave my-let 's face it-overweight body on the cutting-room floor . I was very heavy . " Rubenesque , " my mother called it , but the boys were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not even when I was on the block , waiting for the start . I was no pushover , though . If a boy made fun of the way I bulged in my bathing suit , calling me " Moby Dickless , " for instance , that boy would find himself stunned on the pool bottom , having been swum over by my own impersonation of a great white whale . <p> One Friday night in March , after an exceptionally hard relay practice , Tim Summerton leaned over the gutter when I came trundling in from the last race . He was no looker , all wonky-eyed and stippled with pimples , but had a heart so kind he never went without a date to any school dance . He spat a stream of warm water into my face , which I ducked and spat back at him , laughing . Then he grinned . <p> " Hey , " he said . " The divers and I are going to the Lucky Chow Fun . Want to come ? " <p> I looked at the little clump of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the exhibitionists of the team , with , truly , a little more to look at in their picklesuits than the swimmers had . I would know : I saw underwater remarkably well . " Oooh , Fun , Fun , " the divers were saying in a vaguely ethnic impression . " We have fun fun at Fun Fun . " They were not the smartest boys , our divers , but I suppose anybody who tries to shave his neck with the end of a diving board must be a little lacking in brainpower . <p> " Yeah , " I said . " Sure . " <p> " Great . Meet you there , " Tim said , tapping my head with the pull-buoy he had in his hand . I was overwhelmed with the desire to grab his hand , clutch it to me , cover it in kisses , laugh like a madwoman . Instead I smiled , then went back under the water , holding my breath until I could hold it no longer , then sent it up in a great silvery jellyfish-bubble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . <p> That night , I showered with special care , washed the chlorine off my body , lotioned , powdered . And when I walked out into the cold night , all the gym 's lights went out behind me , and the last employee locked the door behind my back . I left my hat off to let my hair freeze into the thin little snakes I liked to crunch in my fingers , and thought of moo goo gai pan . <p> It was a Friday night , but there was a basketball game at the high school , so the town was very still as I drove through it . Only the Ambassador 's mansion gave a sign of life , every window burning gold . The Ambassador was our local hero , former ambassador to France and Guyana , and once upon a time my father 's great friend , and I always felt a wash of fondness for him when I passed his fine fieldstone mansion on the river . He was an erect , gray man of eighty years old with fine bluish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a huge collection of rare goods from all over the world : a room entirely devoted to masks , one for crystal bowls , one for vases , even one for his miniature schnauzer , with paintings done by great artists of the snarly little beast . Nobody knew for sure , though , because when we were invited , we only saw the ground floor . In any case , my family had n't been invited since we lost my father . <p> Now , on Main Street , only a few shop windows had left their lights on , casting an oily shine to the baseball bats in the souvenir shops , making the artificial flowers in the General Store glow . The Red Dragoon Saloon was open , and there were three Harleys in the sludge on Pioneer Street , but still I was able to park right in front of Lucky Chow Fun , behind Tim Summerton 's Volvo . <p> The restaurant was newish , maybe two years old , and the town 's first tentative step toward ethnic food , unless one counted Gino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a cheap linoleum joint , with an ugly , hand-drawn sign flapping in the wind off the lake , lit from above with a red light . It served a lot of sticky Americanized Chinese food , like General Tso 's Chicken and Fried Rice , and I loved it all , the fat and salt , the scandalous feeling of eating fast food in a hamlet that banned all fast food places , the miniature mythmaking of the fortune cookies . <p> That night , when I stepped out of the car and around to the sidewalk , I almost knocked into a small , shivering figure in an overlarge T-shirt , sweeping the new snow from the walk . " Sorry , " I mumbled , and stepped away , not really looking at the girl I had nearly trampled , only gathering a vague impression of crooked teeth and a jagged haircut . She was just one of the girls who worked at the Lucky Chow Fun , one of the wives or daughters of the owners . Nobody in Templeton cared to figure out who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two men who ran the place were , only calling them Chen One and Chen Two , or Chen Glasses and Chen Fat . Only later did we realize that no part of their names remotely resembled Chen , nor did the girls resemble the men in any way , either . <p> I feel the necessity of explaining our hard-heartedness , but I can not . Templeton has always had a callousness about outsiders , having seen so many come through town , wreak destruction on our lake , trash the ancient baseball stadium , Cartwright Field , litter our streets , and move off . This wariness extended even to those who lived with us ; anyone who was n't related to everyone else was suspect . Newcomers meant people who had only lived in town for fifteen years . The one black family who lived in Templeton during my childhood promptly pulled up roots and moved away after a year , and , to my knowledge , there were only three Jewish children in school . The only Asians were preternaturally cheery and popular , adopted kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was a town that clung ferociously to the shameful high school mascot of The Redskins , though if we were any skins , we should have been The Whiteskins . I was born and raised in this attitude . That night , without a second thought , I stepped around the girl and into the fatty brightness of the restaurant , past old Chen Glasses , snoozing over his Chinese newspaper at the door . <p> The restaurant was nearly empty , the long kitchen in the back sending out a fine oily sizzle , girls like ghosts in white uniforms chopping things , frying things , talking quietly to one another . The backlit photos above the register struck me so powerfully with their water chestnuts and lovingly fried bits of meat that I did n't at first see the divers , who were pretending to be walruses , chopsticks in their mouths like tusks . When they saw me , they took the chopsticks out so fast it was clear who they were imitating . I was not unused to this . In fourth grade , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zeppelin , The Lollie . That night , I did what I always did , stifled the pang , pretended to smile . <p> " Very funny , boys , " I said . " Have you ordered ? " <p> " Yeah , " said Brad Huxley . He was in my grade and blessed with a set of eyelashes that made every girl in school envious . He gave me a dimpled smile , and said , " We ordered by ourselves . These two freaks do n't like sharing , " nodding at the other two . It was his sorrow in life that he was not endowed with hand-eye coordination ; otherwise he would have been on the basketball court that evening with the cool kids . He overcompensated in the diving pool , and in a few weeks , at States , would come so close to the board on his reverse back pike that he had a strip of flayed skin from neck to mid-back , and a perfect score for that dive . <p> I was standing at the front , deciding what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his filthy apron , when Tim Summerton came from the back where the bathrooms were . His face was drawn and pale , and he looked half-excited , half-horrified . He did n't seem to see me , as he walked past me without a glance . He sat down at the table with the others and began to hiss at them something I could n't quite make out . <p> Huxley sat back with a little smirk on his face . " Duh , " he said just loud enough for me to hear . " Everybody knows . " The other two divers looked pale , though , and smiles broke out over their faces . <p> I was about to ask what they were talking about , but Chen Fat said , " Hem hem , " and I turned toward him . His pen was poised over the pad , and his eyelids were drawn down over his eyes . I could n't quite tell if he was looking at me or not . <p> " General Tso 's , please , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang up the bill on the old register , and I forked over my hard-won babysitting money , two dollars an hour for the Bauer hellions . When I sat down , the boys were already digging into their food , and the girl who had served them was backing away , looking down , holding the round tray before her like a shield . This one was pretty , delicate , with pointed little ears and chapped lips , but the boys did n't seem to notice her at all . Tim Summerton , I noticed , was just pushing around his mu shu pork , looking sick . <p> " You okay ? " I said to Tim . He looked up at me , and looked away . <p> " He 's just a pussy , " said Huxley , a grain of rice on his lips . " He 's all nervous about Regionals tomorrow . Does n't want to do the five-hundred free . " <p> " Really ? " I said . " But , Tim , you 're the best we 've got . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , I 'm not too nervous about it . " Then he blinked , and making an effort to change the subject , said , as my plate of crispy delicious chicken was placed before me , " So , who are you taking to the Winter Dance ? " None of the boys really wanted to talk about this , it was clear , but spat out names : Gretchen , Melissa , maybe Gina , maybe Steph . Tim looked at me . " Who you going with , Lollie ? " <p> I shrugged . " I do n't know , " I said . " Maybe just my friends . " Depressing thought : my friends were the girls I ate lunch with , all buddies from kindergarten who knew one another so well we were n't sure if we even liked one another anymore . <p> Huxley gave me his charming smile and said , " Because you 're , like , a dyke , right ? You like chicks ? It 's okay , you can tell us . " He laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " I said , putting my chopsticks down , feeling my face grow hot . " What the hell ? No , I 'm not a whatever , I mean , I like guys , Jesus . " My excitement , the invitation , soured a little in my gut . I looked hard at the curls of chicken on my plate . <p> " Relax , Lollie , " said Tim , grinning at me , his wonky eye traveling over the window , where the world was lit pink by the light over the sign . " He 's just teasing you . Brad 's a dick . " <p> And , charmingly , Huxley winked at me and showed me his mouthful of half-chewed food . " I know you 're no dyke , " he said . " But you could tell us if you were . " <p> " Yeah , " one of the other divers said . " That 's totally hot . " And when we all looked at him a little funny , he blushed and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general . " He gathered high-fives all around , hooting , until something in me burst , and I gave him a little high-five on his cheek , and he sat down again , abashed . <p> In the Chinese myth , the goddess Nii-gua created the first humans from yellow earth , carefully crafting them with her own hands . Though they pleased her , these handicraft humans took too much time , and so to speed the process along , she dipped a rope into the darker mud , and swung it around her head . In this way , she populated the earth with darker mudspatters who became the lowly commoners , while the handcrafted were the wealthy and higher-caste nobles . <p> N-gua , they say , had a woman 's upper body but a dragon 's tail . She invented the whistle , the art of irrigation , the institution of marriage . How terrible that this dragon-goddess was also the one who granted children to women ; that this impatient snob of a goddess was the intermediary between men and women . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after we ate , as if waiting for something to happen . At last , Tim stood and said , " I 'll escort you out , Lollie ? " and I had the brief and thrilling fear that he was going to ask me to the Winter Dance . But Tim only opened my car door for me , then pulled off , his old Volvo spitting up smoke . I drove home over the black ice , and into the drive of our cottage on Eagle Street . <p> My mother 's car was gone , and only one light was on in the kitchen when I came in . Pot was sitting in the half-shadow , looking at me with a tragic face . <p> " Potty ? " I said . " What 's wrong , honey ? " Her little face broke down until , at last , her eyes filled , huge and liquid , with tears . <p> " I wanted your food to be warm , " she said , " so I put up the heat . But then you did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I put it down . And then I got scared because you still were n't home , and so I put the heat up again , and now it 's all ruined , " and she poked the foil off the plate , and her lip began to tremble . <p> " Oh , I 'm so , so sorry . We went out for Chinese , " I said , looking at the charred remains of the chicken and couscous my mother had saved for me . I hugged my little sister until she began to laugh at herself . Then I said , " Petra Pot , where 's Mom ? " <p> She made a frowning face and said , sourly , " The Garbageman 's . " We called our mother 's new boyfriend The Garbageman though he was actually a Ph.D . in garbage science , and owned a lucrative monopoly on trash removal in the five counties surrounding ours . He certainly did n't look like a garbage man , either , being fastidious to the point of compulsion , with his hair combed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrists doused in spicy cologne , with the beautiful shirts he had tailored for him in Manhattan . Though Pot hated him , I was ambivalently happy for my mother 's sudden passion : since we lost my father , she had n't seen anyone , and this , I privately assumed , had made her become as nervous and trembly as she had been in recent years . <p> When I say we lost my father , I do n't mean he died : I mean that we lost him when we were on a sabbatical to England , in the bowels of Harrods department store . This was back when Pot was five and suffering acutely from both dyslexia and ADHD . Her inability to connect language in her head , combined with her short attention span , frequently made her so frustrated she did n't actually speak , but , rather , screamed . " Petra the Pepperpot , " we called her , affectionately , which was shortened to " Pepperpot , " then " Ppot , " then " Pot , " or " Potty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying one , as , all morning , Pot had screamed and screamed and screamed . My dad , having coveted the Barbour oil jackets he 'd seen around him all summer long , had taken us to Harrods to try to find one for himself . But for at least fifteen minutes , he was subjected to the snooty superciliousness of the clerk when he tried to describe the jacket . <p> " Bah-Bah , " my father kept saying , as that 's what he heard when he asked the Brits what kind of jacket they were wearing . " It 's brown and oily . A Bah-Bah jacket . " <p> " I 'm sorry , sir , " the clerk returned indolently . " I 've never heard of a Bah-Bah . " <p> Thus , my father was furious already when my little sister fell into an especially loud apoplectic fit , pounding her heels into the ground . At last , my father turned on us . His face was purple , his eyes bulged under his glasses , and this mild-mannered radiologist seemed about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he hissed , and stalked off . <p> We waited . We waited for hours . My mother rubbed her thin arms , frightened and angry , and I was sent to the vast deli in the basement for sandwiches . Cheddar and chutney , watercress and ham . We waited , and we had no way to contact him , and so , when the store was about to close , we caught a cab back to our rented flat . We found his things gone . He was in a hotel , he said later when he telephoned . He had arranged our tickets home . My mother shut the sliding doors in the tiny kitchen , and Pot and I tried to watch a bad costume drama on the telly , and when our mother came out , we knew without asking that it was all over . Nowadays , my father lives in an Oxford townhouse with a woman named Rita , who is about to have their first child . " Lurvely Rita , Meeta-Maid , " is what my mother so scornfully calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the British manner to the point of unloveliness . <p> But the evening of the Lucky Chow Fun , my father was n't the villain . My mother was . Who leaves a troubled ten-year-old alone in a big old house in the middle of winter ? There were still a few tourists in town , and anyone could have walked through our ever-unlocked front door . I was filled with a terrible fury , tempted to call her at The Garbageman 's place with a sudden faux emergency , let her streak home naked through the snow . And then , after some reflection , I realized I was the villain : my mother had thought I 'd be home by the time she went out , Pot had said . <p> Stricken with guilt , I allowed Pot to take me upstairs to her own creepy ornithological museum . In the dark , the birds ' glass eyes glittered in light from the streetlamps , giving me the odd impression of being scrutinized . I shivered . But Pot turned on the light and led me from bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and giving a respectful little bow as she moved on . At last , she stopped before a new addition to her collection , a dun-colored bird with mischievous eyes . <p> Pot stroked its head , and said , " This is an Eastern Towhee . It goes : hot dog , pickle , ickle , ickle . " <p> " Neat , " I said , feeling the gaze of the gyrfalcon on the tenderest parts of my neck . <p> " Hurry , worry , blurry , flurry , " Pot said . " Scarlet Tanager . " <p> " Cool , " I said . " I like it . Scarlet Tanager . Hey , you want to watch a movie ? " <p> " **26;2001;TOOLONG , " giggled Pot . " White-eyed Vireo . " <p> " Pots , listen up . Do you want to watch Dirty Dancing ? I 'll make popcorn . " <p> " If I sees you , I will seize you , and I 'll squeeze you till you squirt , " my baby sister said , grinning so hugely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinked , held my breath . " Uh , " I said . " Where 'd you get that one , Pot ? " <p> " That 's the call of a Warbling Vireo , " she said with great satisfaction . " Let 's watch The Princess Bride . " <p> My mother was up before we were in the morning , flipping omelets and singing a Led Zeppelin song . " Kashmir , " I think . She beamed at me in the doorway , and when I went to her and bent to kiss her on the head , she still stank of The Garbageman 's cologne . <p> " Ugh , " I said . " You may want to shower before Pot gets up . " <p> She looked at me , frowning . " I did , " she said , pulling a strand of her springy peppered hair across her nose . " Twice . " <p> I took a seat at the table . " That 's the power of The Garbageman 's scent , I guess , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you belong to him . " <p> " Elizabeth , " my mother said , sprinkling cut chives atop the egg . " Can you just try to be happy for me ? " <p> " I am , " I said , but looked down at my hands . I was n't sure what I was happy for , as I had never been on a date , let alone done anything remotely sexual , and it was n't entirely because I was fat . The hard truth was that nobody really dated at Templeton High . Couples were together , or broken up , without really having dated . There was really nowhere to go , the nearest theater in Oneonta , thirty minutes away . And though I suspected there was some sexual activity happening , I was mystified as to how it was instigated . <p> My mother took my hand in a rapid little movement , kissed it , and went to the stairs to shout up for Pot . My sister was always a furious sleeper , everything about her clenched in slumber-face , limbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that morning , she came downstairs whistling , her hair in a sloppy ponytail , dressed in all white , a pair of binoculars slung around her neck . We both stared at her . <p> " I am going bird-watching on the Nature Trail , " she announced , taking a plate . " I 'm wearing white to blend in with the snow . Yummy omelets , Mom . " <p> " Oh . Okay , Honey-Pot . Sounds good , " said my mother , sitting down with her own coffee and plate . She had decided when my father left to be a hands-off parent , and went from hovering nervously over everything I did to allowing my little sister the most astounding latitude . <p> " Wait . You 're going alone , Pot ? " I said . I glared at my mother , this terrible person who would let a ten-year-old wander in the woods alone . What would she do when I was in college , just let my little sister roam the streets at night ? Let her have drunken parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sugar Shack on Estli Ave. , let her be a crack whore ? <p> " Yup , " Pot said . " All alone . " <p> " Mom , " I said , " she ca n't go alone .

" <p> " Five acres that could be filled with rapists , Mom . " <p> " I think Pot will be fine , " said my mother . She and Pot exchanged wry glances . And then she looked at the clock on the microwave , saying , " Do n't you have to be at the gym in fifteen minutes ? " <p> I stifled my protest , warned Pot to take the Mace my mom carried as protection against dogs on her country runs , and struggled into my anorak . Then I stuffed a piece of toast down my gullet , and roared off in my deathtrap Honda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him coming up the walk , back from the Purple Pickle coffee shop , steaming cup in hand , toy schnauzer on a lead in the other , and they both-man and beast-were dressed all in white , with matching white pomponned berets . Curious , I thought , but that was all : I was already focusing , concentrating on the undulations of my body through the water , envisioning the hundred butterfly , watching myself touching all the boys out by an entire body length . <p> In the Grimms ' story of Hansel and Gretel , it is n't the witch in the gingerbread house who is the wickedest character , as the poor wandering siblings easily defeated her with their small cunning . Rather , the parents of the children were the ones who , in a time of famine , not once , but twice , concocted the plan to take their children into the dark forest and leave them there to starve . The first time , the children dropped stones and found their way back . The second time , the forest gobbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The parents were the unnatural ones . This speaks to a deep and ingrained fear : that parents could , in their self-interest , lose sight of their duties to their children . They could sell them to the dark and dank wilderness , send them to the forest , let them starve there . And each time , those two little children , starving for home , would come struggling so bravely back . <p> But nothing happened to Pot that day , and we won Regionale , as nobody could dent our team that year . It was late when we returned , and I was reading Bullfinch 's Mythologies for the nth time , under the red exit light in the back of the bus . I was marveling over the tiny passage on Danae : Daughter of King Acrisius ofArgos who did not want her to marry and kept her imprisoned because he had been told that his daughter 's son would kill him . Jupiter came to her in the disguise of a shower of gold , and she became the mother of Perseus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saved by a fisherman on the island ofSeriphos . There was something so haunting in the story , drama packed so tightly into the words that images burst in my head : a white-limbed girl in a dark room , a chink in the roof , the shower of gold pouring over her dazzled body ; then the dark chest , the baby squirming on her stomach , the terrifying rasp of the scales of sea monsters against the wood . A story of light and dark . Purely beautiful , it seemed to me , then . <p> I was daydreaming so happily as we trundled over Main Street that I did n't at first notice what was happening until one of the freshman boys gave a shout . The bus driver slowed down to rubberneck as we went around the flagpole on Pioneer Street , and I saw it all : all eight of the town 's squad cars up the hill to our left , all flashing red and blue in syncopated flashes , glaring on the ice and snow , and the ambulance with the stretcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drawn guns , the Chens , both Fat and Glasses , up against the Lucky Chow Fun 's vinyl siding , arms and legs spread . A huddled ring of the Lucky Chow Fun girls on the steps . I could pick out the girl with the jagged haircut , her arm around a plump girl with hair to her waist . <p> " Ohhhhh . Shit , " breathed Brad Huxley in the seat before mine . And then the bus passed the scene , and we rolled down Main Street toward the one stoplight in town . From there , the hamlet looked innocent and pristine , a flurry of windblown snow turning the streetlights into snow globes , icing the trees . Over the hills , the March moon was pinned , stoic and yellow , reflected in pieces on the half-glassy lake . <p> We were already halfway up Chestnut Street , silently looking out the windows , when someone said , " One too many cases of food poisoning ? " <p> And though it was n't funny , though we all had the flashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just under our hearts , we-all of us-laughed . <p> I slept late on Sunday , into the afternoon . I never sleep late , and I know what this means : the worst cowards are the ones who refuse to look at what they fear . When I went downstairs , my mother and sister were still in their pajamas . Though Pot was almost my tiny mother 's size , and twice her width , she was cradled on my mother 's lap , sucking her thumb , her hand up in her infant gesture to stroke my mother 's ear . They were watching television , the sound off . I stood in the door , looking at the screen , until I realized that the snowy roads I was seeing on the television were roads I knew as intimately as my own limbs , that the averted faces of the men on the screen were men who knew me well , who followed my swimming in the paper , who thought nothing of giving me a kiss when they saw me . Hurrying down the snowy streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of their shoulders . <p> Then up came the faces of the Chens , stoic , inexpressive , and the scared faces of the Chinese girls , ducking into Mr. Livingston 's limousine . He was my ninth-grade history teacher , his limo the only car in town large enough to hold all the girls and their lawyers at once . That car drove legends of baseball all summer from museum to hotel to airport . It drove brides and homecoming queens for the rest of the year . Now it was driving the Lucky Chow Fun girls wherever they were going . Somewhere , I hoped , far away . <p> I went to the television and turned it off . I stood for a minute , letting the swell die down in my gut , then sat beside my mother and said , " What happened ? " <p> And my mother , who always made a point of being frank about sexual matters , describing biological functions in great detail so that her daughters would never be squeamish or falsely prudish , my mother turned scarlet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . She opened her mouth to speak , then closed it . She bit her lips . <p> Pot said , pulling her thumb from her mouth , " The Lucky Chow Fun 's a whorehouse . " <p> " Pot , " said my mother , then sighed . She looked at me , her thin mouth twisting , patting my thigh . " She 's right , " she said . <p> " What ? " I said . " Wait , what ? " <p> " Last night , " my mother said , slowly , as if trying to order the fragmented truths , " one of the girls at the Lucky died . She was locked in her room with her sister-seems they were being punished-and there was some kind of accidental gas leak . One of them died , and the other one almost did , too . And one of the other girls who knew a little English called the police and tried to leave a tip before the Chens found out . But there are not too many poor speakers of English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They arrested the Chens . " <p> " Oh , God , " I said . I thought of the little huddle of the Lucky Chow Fun girls the night before , flushed red and blue in the flashing lights , how quiet they were , how I never saw their eyes . I never looked . " Mom , " I said . " Who were those girls ? " <p> My mother brushed Pot 's hair out of her eyes , and kissed her on the forehead . She seemed to hesitate , then she said , " They were bought in China and brought over here , it seems . They were poor . They worked in sweatshops . The Chens gave money to their parents , promised a better life . Apparently . " <p> " Slaves , " I said . <p> " On TV , they said that , yes , " said Pot , stumbling over her words . " And some of them , they said on TV that some of them , they 're younger than you , Lollie . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My mother at one point stood and made us some cocoa , but for once , my tongue tasted like ash and I wanted to take absolutely nothing in . I was sick , could never again be hungry , I thought . At last , thinking of Chen Fat glaring at me over his notepad , the sticky smell of the food , Brad Huxley , the delicate girl with the chapped lips , I said , shuddering , " Do they know who visited ? Do they have names ? " <p> " Well , " said my mother , who paused for a very long time , " that 's almost the worst . The Chens wrote down the names of the men who visited the Lucky Chow Fun . " It was hard to hear her , even in the preternatural stillness of the town on this day , even in our snow-muffled house . " They had a ledger . They made sure to write in English . The reporters said that they were going to blackmail the men who visited . Apparently , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men from the town went , too . " She looked at us . " You should know . Some of the men you know , some you love , some of them may have gone . " <p> And there was something so uncertain in my mother 's face , something so fearful it struck a note in me . I looked at the clock over the mantle : it was already four o'clock : my mother had n't left the house yet . Unusual : she was the only person I ever knew who could never sit still . Especially now , when she was dating The Garbageman , for whom she often cooked most meals and who , by this time on Sunday , had usually called our house to chat for hours , as if they were silly teenagers in love . <p> " Oh , " I said . I looked at her face under her mop of curls , the weary circles around her eyes . " The Garbageman call today ? " <p> My mother flushed again and stood to carry the mugs back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed this over her shoulder , as if it meant nothing to her at all . <p> I looked at Pot , who was frowning solemnly on her perch on the living room couch . She looked beyond me at a bird that landed on the tree outside , and cried , " A Song Sparrow ! Hip , hip , hip hurrah , boys , spring is here ! That 's what they say , " she said , beaming . " The Song Sparrows . They say Hip , hip , hip hurrah , boys , spring is here ! " She was tapping her feet in her excitement , blinking so rapidly and nervously that she reminded me of my mother . <p> " Pot , " I said . " Have you taken your medication today ? " <p> " Whoops , " she said , grinning . <p> " Pot , " I said . " How long has it been since you took your medication ? " <p> She shrugged . " A week ? Maybe a week . I stopped . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I shuddered because I heard in her words the distinct voice of an adult , someone who never saw Pot as she was in her awful years . A teacher , perhaps , or some judgmental village crone . I went to the kitchen , slamming the door behind me . " Mom , " I said . " Pot 's not taking her medication . And by the way , do n't you think she 's too young to understand all this Lucky Chow Fun crap ? She 's only ten . She 's just a baby . I do n't think she can handle it . " <p> My mother stopped washing the mug she was holding , and let the hot water run . The steam circled up around her , catching in her frizzy gray hair , spangling it when she turned around . " LoIlie , " she said . " I 'll make sure she takes the Ritalin from now on . But nobody in town is going to be able to escape what happened . Not even the kids . It 's better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her something much worse . " <p> " What 's worse ? " I said . " And I do n't think people are made to take truths straight on , Mom . It 's too hard . You need something to soften them . A metaphor or a story or something . You know . " <p> " No , " she said , " I do n't . " She turned off the water with a smack of her hand . " Why do n't you teach me , since you seem to know everything . " <p> " Well , " I said , but at the moment when we most need these things , they do n't always come to us . I could n't remember a word . I opened my mouth , and it hung open there , useless . I closed it . I shrugged . <p> My mother nodded . " That 's what I thought , " she said , and turned away . <p> Years later , I would have had the presence of mind to offer the tale of Pitcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up an allegorical explanation . I would have told my mother how a wizard dressed as a beggar would magically lure little girls into his basket . He 'd cart them to his mansion , give them an egg and key , and tell them not to go into the room that the key opened . Then he 'd leave , and the little girls would explore the magnificent house , finally falling prey to curiosity and opening the door of the forbidden chamber . <p> There , they 'd find a huge basin filled with the bloody , dismembered remains of other girls . In their surprise , they 'd drop the egg in the vat , and would n't be able to wipe the stain away . When the wizard would come home to find the stained egg , he would dismember the girls and toss their remains into the vat . <p> Eventually , he did this to the two eldest girls from one family , and came back for the third daughter . This girl , though , was uncommonly clever . She hid the egg in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only to find her dismembered sisters in the bloody vat . But instead of panicking , she pulled their severed limbs out and pieced them back together again , and when the parts were reassembled , the girls miraculously came back to life . <p> The clever girl hid her sisters in a room to await the wizard , and when he returned and saw she had n't bloodied the egg , he decided to marry her . She agreed , but said first that she would send him home with a basketful of gold for her parents . She hid her two sisters in the basket , which he carted home , now a servant of his clever bride . In his absence , the little ' girl dressed a human skull in flowers and jewels and put it in the attic window . Then she rolled herself in honey and feathers to transform herself into a strange feathered creature , and ran out into the bright day . <p> On her way home , she encountered the wizard , who thought she was a wonderful bird and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from , where from ? " <p> To which she responded , " From feathered Fitze Pitcher 's house I 've come . " <p> " And the young bride there , how does she fare ? " he asked , imagining his marriage night , and the soft young body of his wife . <p> And she , smiling softly under her down and honey , said , " She 's swept the house all the way through , and from the attic window , she 's staring down at you . " <p> When the wizard arrived home to find the skull in the window , he waved at it , thinking it was his bride . When he went inside , the brothers and father of the little stolen girls locked the door and set a fire and burnt the terrible murderer up . <p> In the story , of course , the community at last cleansed itself by fire , and in the aftermath came out righteous and whole . This did not happen to Templeton . <p> We were under siege . The media trucks were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , was famous for the baseball museum , for its beauty , an all-American village . Right-wing pundits on television , in the mega-corporation-owned newspapers , held our town as a symbol for the internal moral rot of America , a symbol of the trickle-down immorality stemming from our Democrat president who went around screwing everything that moved . People from Cherry Valley and Herkimer roared into town , pretending that they were natives , and the whole country saw us as drawling mulleted hicks in whole-body Carhartt , and hated us more . The handsome newscasters shivered in their furlined parkas , sat at our diner , trying to eavesdrop , but really only eavesdropping on other newscasters . <p> Our shell-shocked mayor appeared on television . He was the town know-it-all , a bearded hobbit of a man who gave bombastic walking tours to the tourists and wore shorts all year because of a skin condition . He had to pause to wipe his mouth with a handkerchief , choking up throughout his speech . At the end , he said , " Templeton will survive , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Be brave , Templeton , and we will see each other through . " But there was no applause at the end , as there were no Templetonians in the audience , composed as it was of disaster-gawkers and newscasters . <p> Our Ambassador appeared on CNN and 20/20 to defend our town . " We are not perfect , " he said in his quivery old man 's voice . " But we are a good town , full of good people . " His cloudy eyes filled with fervor . It was very affecting . <p> We stayed inside . We went to the grocery store , if we needed to , to the school , and a few of us went to the gym . Our team practiced in virtual silence , the only sound the water sucking in the gutters , the splash of our muscled limbs . In school , the teachers came to classes with red-rimmed eyes , traces of internal anguish happening in the homes of people we never imagined had private lives . The drama kids pretended to weep at lunch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town as if each of us was muted , swaddled in invisible quilts , so separate from one another as to not be able to touch , if we wanted to . Girls began walking in groups everywhere , as if for protection . The Templeton men did not dare to look at the Templeton women , furious as we were , righteous . And in this separation , in our own sorrow , we forgot about the girls , the Lucky Chow Fun girls , and when , after some time , we thought of them , they were the enemies . They had brought this shame into our town . <p> Two terrible weeks passed . My mother stopped talking about The Garbageman , tout court . He stopped calling . She stopped visiting him with plates of food . She grew drawn and pale , spent a lot of time in her flannel nightgown , watching Casablanca . She picked a new fight with the principal , and came home spitting . The Winter Dance was cancelled . I spent that evening dating a pizza and an apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pure grace . Pot acquired two new taxidermied birds , one finch , one scarlet macaw , its head cocked intelligently even in death . <p> One day , I came home , skirting Main Street and its hordes of news cameras . I went to the mailbox , and found six envelopes from colleges all over the country , all addressed to me . <p> I went inside . I sat at the table with a cup of tea , the six letters splayed before me . One by one , I opened them . And what would have been a personal tragedy before the Lucky Chow Fun was now a slight relief . Of the six colleges , all of which had recruited me for swimming , though I had indifferent grades and mediocre SATs , I had only gotten into one . <p> Rather : I had gotten into one . One , glorious , one . <p> I tossed out the bad five , and waited for Pot . My tea cooled , and I made more , and it cooled again . I peered out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come . I made cookies , chocolate chip , her favorite . I had a half an hour before swim practice , and she still was n't home when my mother came in , with her energetic stompings and mutterings . " My God , Lollie , " she said , " you 'll never guess what that ass-muncher of a princip- " <p> " Mom ? " I interrupted . " Do you know where Potty is ? " <p> " Is n't she here ? " she said , massaging her neck , peeping in from the mudroom . " She was supposed to come straight home from school to go to the grocery store with me . " <p> " Nope , " I said . " And it 's getting dark . " <p> She came into the kitchen then , scowling . " Do you have any idea where she could be ? " she said . We looked at each other , and her hand floated up to her hair . <p> I stood , nervous . " Oh , God , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though she had become flustered herself . " Think , Lollie . Does she have any friends ? " <p> " Pot ? " I said . I looked at her . " You 're kidding , right ? " <p> " Oh , God , " she said . <p> " Let 's think , let 's think , " I said . I paced to the window , then back . " Mom . Let 's think . Where does Potsy get her birds ? The stuffed ones . Do you know ? " <p> My mother looked at me , then slowly lifted her hands to her cheeks . " You know , " she said , " I never actually wondered . I guess I assumed your dad was sending them . Or she was buying them with her allowance . Or something . I never wondered . " <p> " You have n't given us allowance in six months , " I said . " So where are they from ? " <p> " Is she stealing them ? " said my mother . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pot ? " I thought of this , wondering if Pot could have the gall to waltz into some place , open up the display cabinets , hide the birds under her shirt , and waltz on home . " I do n't think so . It 's not like her , " I said , at last . <p> " Well , " said my mother , her voice breaking . " Who 'd have a collection like that ? " <p> And my mother and I looked at one another . There was a long , shivery beat , a car driving by outside , its headlights washing over my mother 's face , then beyond . And then we both ran out coatless into the snow , we ran into the blue twilight as hard as we could up the block , forgetting about our cars in our hurry , we ran past the grand old hospital , over the Susquehanna , we ran fleet and breathless to the Ambassador 's house , and then we burst inside . <p> The house was extraordinarily hot , the chandelier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barked and nipped at us . Our shoes slid on the marble floor as we sped into the living room . Bookcases , Persian rugs , leather armchairs ; no Pot . We flew through the door , into the library ; no Pot . We ran through the hall and stopped short in the dining room . <p> There , my little sister was dressed in a feather boa and rhinestone starlet glasses , in her undershirt , crouching on an expensive cherry wood chair and looking at a book of birds that was at least as big as she was . She looked up at us , unsurprised , when we came in . <p> " Hey , " she said , " Mom , Lollie , come here , look at this . This is a first edition Audubon . The Ambassador said I could have it when I 'm eighteen . " <p> " What the hell are you doing here ? " my mother said , snapping from her surprise , and charging over to her . She ripped the glasses from Pot 's face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up at her , her face open and wondering . <p> That 's when the Ambassador appeared in the doorway and said , " Oh , dear . I told Miss Petra here she should have been home hours ago . But you know her and birds , " and he gave a tinkly little laugh . <p> " You , " I said , charging at him . " What in the fuck are you doing with my sister ? Why is she in her undershirt ? " <p> " Pot , " my mother was saying at the same time . " Has he touched you ? Has he hurt you ? Has he done anything to you ? " <p> The Ambassador blinked , his milky eyes canny . " Oh , my , " he said mildly . " Oh , I 'm afraid there 's been a misunderstanding . Pot told me you knew she visited with me . " <p> " We did not , " I said . " Are you hurting her ? " <p> Pot gave a little bark of surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . Jeez , you guys . I mean , like . I do n't think he even . You know . Girls , " she trailed off . <p> We looked at her . <p> She sighed . " No girls . He does n't like them , " she said . <p> My mother and I looked at the Ambassador , who flushed , ducked his head . " Well , " he said . " Well , Petra . Oh , my . But yes , you are right . And no , I have never touched Petra . She comes here after school , and I give her one object of her choice every week . I have no heirs , you know , " he said . " I have so many beautiful things . Petra is an original . She is a pleasure to talk to . She will one day be something great , I warrant . " <p> " He lets me wear a boa , " said Pot . " He lets me be a movie star . He knew Grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to take off my sweater . It 's always one hundred degrees exactly . I die if I do n't take off my sweater . " <p> " Yes . I 'm afraid I am anemic , " the Ambassador said delicately . " I can not bear cold . " He looked at our shoes , dripping slush onto his fine floors . He said , " Could I make some tea for you before you three ladies return home ? " <p> My mother and I stared at the Ambassador for a very long moment . And then , in shame , we gathered ourselves up . We apologized , we clutched our little Pot tightly to us . And he , ever the statesman , pretended we had n't offended him . " These times , " he sighed , escorting us to the door , where the wind had blown a great heap of powder onto the priceless rug . " In these dark days , there is so much distrust in this town . I understand absolutely . You never know quite what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shivered , and Pot reached up and squeezed his hand . In the glance between the two there was such adoration that , on the long walk through the dark , I stole small looks at Pot to try to see what exactly he had seen in her , the budding wonder he saw . The one she would become , in time . <p> It took a lot of time . Templeton could not heal quickly . There was still much scandal , many divorces , many people leaving town to start over . The dentist I had been to all my life . The school custodian , the principal , the football coach . My postman ; the town librarian ; my best friend 's brother ; the owner of the boatyard ; the manager of the Purple Pickle ; the CFO of the baseball museum , all divorced . Brad Huxley sent to military school . The Garbageman moved to Manhattan , though his trucks still rumble by every Thursday morning . And there were many more . <p> But the newscasters trickled away when a professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a new angst . The tourists returned as if nothing had happened , and there were motorboats again on the lake , my tearful graduation , the Deathby-Chocolate binge the night before I drove off to school . The Chens were shipped back to China , and the girls were taken to San Francisco , where most of them decided to make a new life . To heal . I read of their trial in the Templeton Journal , from the safety of my dorm room my freshman year . In the end , time smoothed it all away . <p> But for those of us who return periodically , there is always a little frisson of darkness that falls over us when we see the candy shop where the Lucky Chow Fun once had been . <p> Only now , many years later , can I imagine what the real tragedy had been . It had not been the near-death of my town , though that was where all my sympathy was at the time . I mourned the community that almost buckled under the scandal , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were split . As was my training , I forgot about the poor Lucky Chow Fun girls . Only now , years later , do I dream of them . <p> Once upon a time there were seven girls . They were girls like any other girls , no cleverer , no more or less wealthy than others in their town . They were pretty as young girls are always pretty , blooming , rose-cheeked , lily-skinned . The factory they worked in was gray , the machines they worked on were gray , the nighttime streets they walked back to their crowded apartments , all gray . But they dreamt in colors , in blues , and greens , and golds . <p> One dark night , the girls ' parents closed the doors . Conferred . When they came out , the girls were told : we are sending you to America . There should have been joy in this , but the parents ' smiles were also taut with fear . <p> How much ? the girls asked , trembling . <p> Enough , the parents responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And the seven girls were taken to the docks . They crawled into the boxes , they were sealed inside with the water and candy and pills . There , with the bones of their knees pressed to the bones of their ribs , hearing the roar of the tanker , they saw nothing in the darkness but more darkness . <p> They arrived , weak and trembling . They were unpacked . They were taken to the house where they were trained to be quiet , absent , to press themselves to the mattresses and not say a word . In that house , they slowly became ghosts . <p> The seven ghosts were put then into the van , driven to the cold town on the lake , where nobody knew who they were , nobody cared if they were living or dead , where they cooked silently , cleaned silently , lay on the mattresses , and did not say a word . Men went into their rooms , men left their rooms , other men came in . <p> One ghost stopped eating , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ghosts were forced to row her to the middle of the black lake . They tied her limbs to grease buckets filled with stones , and they dropped her in . She sank under the water and seemed to blink up at them as she went . The ghosts rowed back . Wordless , as always . <p> Then there were six ghosts . The two that were sisters were punished , locked into a room . The air was bad , and one died , the other almost did . And one of the remaining ghosts found the dead girl and her half-dead sister . She touched the blue cheeks of the dead girl , and she only felt cold . Something old rose in her , some small courage . She stole one moment with the phone , spoke words , clumsy , ugly , perhaps , but those words breathed life back into the girls , brought liberty in the form of flashing red and blue lights . <p> In the end , after the long trial , the men who 'd imprisoned them were imprisoned themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose to stay , where , slowly , they went out into the streets . They saw the green of the water , the gold of the sky , and they learned what it meant to be girls again . I imagine them there , together , walking in some garden , their hair gleaming under the sun . I imagine them happy . <p> And it is a happy ending , perhaps , in the way that myths and fairy tales have happy endings ; only if one forgets the bloody , dark middles , the fifty dismembered girls in the vat , the parents who sent their children into the woods with only a crust of bread . I like to think it 's a happy ending , though it is the middle that haunts me . <p> Author Affiliation
