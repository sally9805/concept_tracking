Chapter One It was n't much , really , the whole Jessica Feeney thing . If you look at it , nothing much happened . She was a girl who came into my class after the beginning of the year and was only there for a couple of weeks or so . Stuff did get a little crazy for a while , but it did n't last long , and I think it was mostly in my head anyway . Then she was n't there anymore . That was pretty much it . I had a bunch of things going on then , and she was just one of them . There was the car and the class election and Courtney and Jeff . But there was Jessica , too . If I think about it now , I guess I would say that the Friday before she came was probably the last normal day for a while . As normal as things ever were with me and Jeff . It was the last week of September . The weather had been warm all the way from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , navy blue pants , white shirts , and blue ties , and it was hot in our uniforms . I sweat most of those days , right through my shirt , making what some of the kids called stink spots under the arms . We were n't allowed to take off our blazers in school , even when it was hot , so mine always got stained from the sweat . Like most afternoons , I got off the bus at Jeff Hicks 's house . We jumped from the top of the bus stairs and hit the front yardrunning , our blazers flying in our hands . " You ever smell blood ? " he asked , half turning to me . Jeff had been my friend for about three years , since the summer after third grade . As we went up the side steps to his house , I remember thinking that he asked me off-the-wall questions a lot . " What ? " I said . Jeff always said some strange thing , then waited , and I would ask " what ? " so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He reached the door first . " Did you ever smell blood ? " he repeated . " What does that mean ? " I asked . " Sometimes my mom comes home from the hospital all bloody from the emergency room- " We rushed through the side door , making a lot of noise in the empty kitchen . Jeff 's house was always unlocked , even though it had been empty all day . " - some guy 's guts on her shirt , " he said . " It 's so gross . It 's the coolest thing . So , did you ever smell blood ? " He yanked open the refrigerator door . " I do n't know . Maybe . When I cut my finger- " " That 's not enough . I mean a lot . A whole glass of the stuff . " I felt my stomach jump a little . " A glass of blood ? " I said . " Who has glasses of blood ? " He pulled out a tumbler of red liquid-blood ? - from the refrigerator and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally realized it was cranberry juice . The juice sloshed all down his chin and onto the front of his white shirt . His shirt had little blots of red spreading down the front as he was dripping juice and laughing and watching me , until I laughed , too , at the whole thing . " Stupid , " I breathed . " How long did you have that glass waiting in there ? " Laughing even harder , he put the dripping glass on the kitchen table and wiped his mouth on his cuff . " By the way , I went for a ride in it last night . " He went to the basement door and pulled it open . I was still looking at the glass on the table . " Huh ? " He jumped down the stairs to a room with a TV and paneling . There were dark wooden shelves on the walls piled with stacks of his comic books . I was right behind him . " You went for a ride in what ? " It was that game again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain , " he said . " My uncle 's Cobra . I thought it was all you ever thought about . " " Yeah ? The Cobra ? " He snickered as he went to the shelves . " The Cobra . " A Cobra is a classic sports car from the 1960s . I love Cobras . Not the skinny kind they made for a couple of years , but the fat one . You see them every once in a while . A Cobra is low and all curved and super-fat , like a chunky bug that 's pumped up like a balloon . It is n't a family car . It 's just two seats , a steering wheel , and pedals on the floor . It 's a machine . The racing tires are really fat . The wheel wells over each tire flare out like big , angry lips . The front end of a Cobra looks like a snake , with two headlights like eyes and a big mouth ( the radiator hole ) that could suck the pavement right up into it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love Cobras . I 've built plastic models of them . I 've bought magazines about them . I once went to an auto show with my father , and they had a red racing Cobra there . The shine was so thick it seemed like if you dipped your finger into it , it would be hot and wet . But they would n't let you get near enough to touch it . " As if it 's so hot it 'll burn you , " I remember telling my father . He laughed . Cruise nights at a drive-in restaurant in the next town sometimes had a Cobra , too . That past spring , Jeff had told me his uncle had an original Cobra , and I was totally floored . He had restored it from a used one he bought in New York , where he lives . I had never seen the car , but Jeff told me it was a red one . " The kind you like , " he had said . People do n't really talk to me much in school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says it 's because I do n't " get out there . " But Jeff and I had been friends for a long time . We never really said much to each other , but we did stuff almost every day . I always got his jokes , and I think he liked that . I remember feeling it was so cool that he knew I liked red Cobras . Jeff had said his uncle sometimes brought it up to his house , and he got to ride in it . But I did n't get why I had never seen the car . " I 've never even seen your uncle , " I said . Jeff was flipping through a stack of comics he had taken down from a shelf . He chose one and slumped in a chair with it . He did n't say anything . " I do n't have an uncle , " I went on . " I do n't get the whole uncle thing . It 's just me and my parents . Neither of them had sisters or brothers . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on babbling . " Uncles always seem like these guys who get to have all the cool stuff fathers never get to have . " Finally , he dropped his comic into his lap and looked at me . " Yeah , well , my Uncle Chuck has a Cobra . And he 's coming over next weekend . " I think my heart thumped really loudly . " Saturday ? Next Saturday ? " He shook his head . " No , the weekend after . The ninth I think my mother said . Maybe we 'll drive over to your house in the car . " He pushed the comic book off his lap . " Really ? " He got up . " My mom said she got me two Avengers and a Spawn , the one where he bites through to another world . But she hid them because I yelled at her . Let 's find them . I need to get all the school junk out of my head . " " Really ? You mean it about the car ? The Cobra ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Sure . Let 's check her bedroom .
