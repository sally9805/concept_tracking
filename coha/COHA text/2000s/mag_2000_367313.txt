DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS JR . completed nearly all his movies by 1951 , when he was 42 years old . Thus he spent more than half his adult life not being a movie star . That was fine with him , for the family business was n't acting ; it was international celebrity , a trade his father Douglas Sr. virtually invented . It seemed his son , with whom I collaborated on a book and a 25-year friendship , wanted to see if he could retain his fame by appearing as little as possible in public . <P> At this he did splendidly  --  a chipper , light-spirited man , always with a fresh carnation on the lapel of his bespoke suits , telling well-turned anecdotes about his favored adulthood and pained childhood . A knighted Anglophile , he risked his career speaking against U.S. isolationism before World War II , fought bravely in it ( he was childishly vain about his medals ) and was a little resentful , later on , when show biz did n't give him any Old Guy awards . But by then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace and charm . He made his living mysteriously  --  producing and arranging  --  but when he appeared , in drawing-room comedy revivals , his welcomes were thunderous . He pretended astonishment but basked in the warmth of these tributes to his essential quality : old-fashioned , unspoken gallantry . <P>  --  By Richard Schickel
