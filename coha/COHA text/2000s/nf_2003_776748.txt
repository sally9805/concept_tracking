Oswald 's Mother // In those days , I was the night police reporter at the Fort Worth StarTelegram , the newspaper in the town where I grew up . I was twenty-six years old , made $115 a week and worked the late trick , 6 P.M. to 2:30 A.M. // I hung out with cops , emergency-room nurses , barmaids and other creatures of the night . Like most young reporters who covered crime , I considered myself a superb investigator , more cop than journalist . I wore a snap-brim hat , hoping I 'd be mistaken for a detective , and when someone made that mistake I never corrected him . The stories I covered were an endless series of car wrecks and murders , the hours were awful , the pay was low , even by Texas newspaper standards , and I thought it was about the best job anyone could ever have . // But when I heard that President Kennedy was coming to Fort Worth , I was n't entirely happy about it . In those days , presidents did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was big news for my hometown , but bad news for me . Kennedy 's visit would cause no interruption in my regular schedule . The political reporters would handle Kennedy . They would not need any help from me . For a reporter , there 's nothing worse than being in the middle of a big story that someone else is covering , and I was more than a little irritated . // Kennedy and his entourage flew into Fort Worth late on a Thursday evening and , assignment or no assignment , once we put the paper to bed early Friday morning , I hustled over to the Press Club , which was being held open after-hours to accommodate the traveling White House press corps . The party was well under way when I got there around 2 A.M. , and for me this was as good as it got . There I was , chatting up reporters I had known only for their bylines , Merriman Smith of UPI , Tom Wicker of the New York Times , Bob Pierpoint of CBS and a dozen more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Democratic Party and to raise money for the ' 64 campaign , and the tour had started in Houston and San Antonio . After a Thursday-night speech in Houston , he had flown to Fort Worth to spend the night and attend an early-morning Chamber of Commerce breakfast before taking a ten-minute flight to Dallas for a parade and luncheon speech . The tour was to end with a huge fund-raising dinner in Austin . Governor John Connally had convinced Kennedy that only in Austin , the state capital , could you count on getting people from the rest of the state to come to a fund-raiser . People from Houston would n't go to San Antonio for a fund-raiser , Connally told Kennedy , and people from Fort Worth damn sure would n't go to Dallas . He was right about that . When Amon Carter was running the Star-Telegram , he made a point of taking a sack lunch when he had business in Dallas , claiming he did not care for the city 's restaurants . Dallas repaid the courtesy when Fort Worth built an airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dallas residents declined to use the airport , in large part because of the name , and the airport eventually failed . ( There was and is such a rivalry between the two cities that the only project they ever cooperated on is the current airport . Planners were careful not to name it after anyone from either city . ) The visiting reporters had no interest in our airports , of course . What they did want to know about was a local after-hours joint called the Cellar . The Cellar had no liquor license , but if you were a friend of the owner , a former stockcar racer named Pat Kirkwood , the drink of choice , Kool-Aid spiked with grain alcohol , was on the house . It was not the drinks , but the fact that the Cellar 's waitresses wore only underwear , that had given the place some notoriety and the notoriety had apparently spread as far as Washington . Hippies and free love would descend on San Francisco , and Kirkwood always claimed his place was a forerunner of what was to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night city editor , and I were appointed to guide our visitors to it . // It seemed a good idea at the time and must have been quite an evening . I remember that we stayed long enough for some of the easterners to see their first Fort Worth sunrise . A group of off-duty Secret Service agents joined us , and in months to come , there would be congressional hearings into whether the visit had left them as alert as they should have been the next day in Dallas . // Having no assignment the next day , I could afford to sleep late , which was my normal practice , anyway . I was the oldest of three children and my father had died when I was in college , so I still lived in my mother 's house , helping her to make a home for my brother , Tom , and my sister , Sharon . Tom had been ten when Dad died and Sharon fifteen , but by the time Kennedy came to Texas , Tom was in high school , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been shot-you 'd better get to work ! " // Tom had been allowed to miss school that day , and he and Mother had driven into town early to see the president as he emerged from the Chamber of Commerce breakfast . As Kennedy walked out of the Texas Hotel and toward his car , Tom had been one of the last people in Fort Worth to shake his hand . Within hours and before they had returned home , Kennedy had been shot . // I dressed as quickly as I could , grabbed my black felt snap-brim Dick Tracy hat , and roared off in my two-seater Triumph TR-4 sports car . As I parked in the lot near the Star-Telegram office , the radio confirmed the worst : The president was dead . It was as if someone had hit me with a hammer . At once , I was stunned , hurt and embarrassed . Stunned , because such violence was unthinkable in those days ; hurt and embarrassed , because it had happened in our home state . Why did something like this have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Texas ? // As I made my way inside , lines of people two and three across were already surrounding the Star-Telegram building . The Kennedy assassination would be the first story that the entire nation would watch together on television , and because of it television would soon replace newspapers as the place where most Americans got their news . But when Kennedy was shot , people still really did n't believe the news unless they saw it written down in black and white , so hundreds waited outside the Star-Telegram for the special editions that rolled off the presses . " The truth was , we could n't print them fast enough , " said one of our editors later . " People would stand in line to buy one edition , then go to the back of the line to buy a copy of the next one . " They were the last of the great newspaper Extras and they would come to symbolize the end of the newspaper era. // Inside the city room it was bedlam . When the flash that Kennedy had been shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many reporters to Dallas that there was no one left on the city desk to answer the phones , and they were all ringing . Nonetheless , one of the editors told me to get to the police station . A man carrying a load of dynamite in his car had been arrested leaving Dallas County and was being brought to the Fort Worth jail . He was the best suspect so far in the Kennedy shooting . // I managed to get to the police station just as he was being brought down the back stairs . Early in my police reporting days , I learned a trick from the cops . People will sometimes blurt out the truth if they are surprised by the question , so I jumped in front of the handcuffed suspect , who was between two detectives , and shouted , " You son of a bitch , why did you do it ? " // " Well , I did n't , " he said , as the cops hustled him into the lockup. // In a matter of hours , it would become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more about the assassination than the rest of us . He had stopped for gas at a service station between Dallas and Fort Worth and mentioned to the attendant what he had heard on the radio , that the president had been shot . The attendant had n't heard about it and called the cops , figuring the only person who could have known about the shooting was the one who had done it . When police stopped the man 's car and found the trunk loaded with dynamite , it was enough for them , too . As the afternoon wore on , it was determined that the man was exactly who he said he was , a demolition contractor who was en route to a construction job . Had it happened today , it would have triggered dozens of lawsuits against the city and the police and at least the threat of one against me ; but the police apologized , and the man said no problem and went on his way . // When I got back to the city room , the confusion was worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the scene in Dallas , but when they called in , there was no one on the city desk to answer the phones and take down the stories they were trying to call in. // I had n't even removed my hat when I settled behind a typewriter and picked up one of the ringing phones . In all my years as a reporter , I would never again take a call like that one . // A woman 's voice asked if we could spare anyone to give her a ride to Dallas . // " Lady , " I said , " this is not a taxi , and besides , the president has been shot . " // " I know , " she said . " They think my son is the one who shot him . " // It was the mother of Lee Harvey Oswald , and she had heard on the radio of her son 's arrest . // " Where do you live ? " I blurted out . " I 'll be right over to get you . " // Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had lived a vagabond life during most of Oswald 's childhood , but she had eventually settled in Fort Worth , and when Oswald had defected to the Soviet Union , Star-Telegram reporters had interviewed her . We would also later learn that sometime before the assassination , she had worked briefly as a governess in the home of Star-Telegram founder Amon Carter 's son . The family had had no idea she was the mother of a defector , but had discharged her because the children complained that " she was mean . " // Whether those connections prompted her call , we never knew , nor did I know any of that as I began to think about how I was going to get her to Dallas . Somehow , taking her there in a two-seater open sports car just did n't seem quite right . Which led me to the desk of Bill Foster , the paper 's automotive editor . For years , local car dealers had furnished the auto editor with a new car and gas to fuel it . It was offered and accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would " road-test " the car and write up the results in his Sunday column . Not surprisingly , the reviews were usually favorable . When Bill told me he was driving a Cadillac sedan that week , I said , " Come on , I 'll explain as we go and you 're gon na like it . " // We found Mrs. Oswald on the lawn of a small home on Fort Worth 's west side . She was a short , round-faced woman in enormous , black horn-rimmed glasses and a white nurse 's uniform . She carried a small blue travel bag . I got into the backseat with her and Bill drove . She was distraught , but in an odd way . I would later come to believe she was mentally deranged , but for most of the trip she seemed less concerned with the death of the president and for her son than with herself . She railed about how Oswald 's Russian-born wife would get sympathy while no one would " remember the mother " and that she would probably starve . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bring myself to use her self-serving remarks in the story I filed later that day . I probably should have . She would later be so brazen as to tell a reporter for Life magazine that " Mama wants money , " and years later she was still saying the same things . As she had predicted , the world showed her little sympathy and she supported herself in the end by selling Oswald 's clothing to souvenir hunters . // The drive to Dallas took about an hour , and when we reached the police station , Bill let us out and said he would join us later once he had parked the car . Hundreds of reporters had converged on the station , most of them in a hallway where the detective offices were located . Since I was wearing the Dick Tracy hat , it was easy for me to pass for a plainclothesman . There was a uniformed cop behind a counter in one of the offices so I approached him and said , " I 'm the one who brought Oswald 's mother over from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wo n't be bothered by all these reporters ? " // The officer guided us to a small space that seemed to be some kind of interrogation room and said , " How about this ? " I said thanks , settled Mrs. Oswald in and went into the hallway to see if I could help our guys . By then , there were seventeen of us on the scene , but the problem was finding phones to call in what we had found out . Other reporters were having to walk several blocks to find phones . I began to gather up what our team had collected , and called it in from the office the police had given to Mrs. Oswald and me . Never once did anyone ask me who I was . As the evening wore on , Oswald 's wife was brought to the police station and an officer asked me if we would mind if they let her share the room . I told them I saw no problem . The only difficulty for me was that she seemed to speak no English , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Detective Captain Will Fritz if they could visit Oswald . Fritz agreed , and led us into a holding room below the jail . The group included Oswald 's wife , his mother , an FBI agent and me . I could n't believe it . Oswald was being brought down from his cell . I would soon be face-to-face with the man who was being charged with killing our president . Whatever Oswald said , this would have to be the story of a lifetime . An exclusive interview with the man who had just been charged with killing the president . We had only been there a few minutes , but to me it seemed an eternity and I could feel my heart beginning to beat faster , when the FBI agent casually asked , " And who are you with ? " // I had watched veteran interrogators bluff their way with a suspect by answering a question with a question , and in my best imitation I sort of half snarled , " Well , who are you with ? " // The agent seemed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // Now I was really pushing it : " Well , are n't you ? " // It was at this point that I believe I received my first official death threat . The embarrassed agent said he would kill me if he ever saw me again . Or at least that seemed to be what he was saying . I was already leaving as he said it . // It would be the biggest story I almost got but did n't , and I went back to the crowded corridor and blended in with the rest of the reporters . For the next two days , I would just be part of the crowd . //
