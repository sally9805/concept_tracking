<p> Nervous about the snarling bear that 's been stalking Wall Street ? " Keep the faith and stay put , the market will come back , " insists Joe Tigue , managing editor of The Outlook , a financial review published by Standard &; Poor 's Corp . How many US stock investors would like to embrace that optimism , battered as they have been by falling market indexes ? This has not been a jolly time for Wall Street in general - and small investors in particular - with all major stock-market indexes in double-digit declines . Measured from their market peaks , the indexes have been spelling out " bear market " - that turbulent situation when markets tumble a hefty 20 percent or more . Nor does it look like the downslide is over . " This is a difficult investing environment , " says Larry Wachtel , a market analyst with investment house Prudential Securities Inc. , in New York . " But having endured one full year of pain and $ 4 trillion of lost valuations , investors can ride the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactic adopted by investors the Monitor interviewed . Such investor patience is likely to be tested in the short term . " We are now in a ' confessional ' period when companies are making a lot of unhappy pre-announcements " about lower-than-expected earnings , Mr. Wachtel says . Withdrawals from stock mutual funds are rising , he notes . And there are an increasing number of margin calls against investors who 've bet the bank on favorite stocks - and lost . Last Tuesday , the Fed cut interest rates another half a percentage point . But analysts say the tepid response from investors suggests the Fed will be forced to make additional rate cuts . " Regular corporate-earnings reports will be issued starting in early April . What we need to hear from companies is that their projections of future earnings are not getting any worse , " Wachtel says . " That alone may help to start the market back up . " Standard &; Poor 's , for its part , is one of many Wall Street shops anticipating the market will rebound by year 's end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at about 1350 points , S &P; economists say , up from the current level of about 1150 . Indeed , S &P; is currently telling its clients they should have 65 percent of their portfolio in stocks , 25 percent in bonds , and only 10 percent in cash . So far , most small investors in the US appear to be accepting the prospects of a resurgent market later this year . While some investors have cashed out , most are staying firm . For investors in their 40 , 50s , or near retirement , that is not always easy , as they watch the value of their portfolios shrink . Investors in their 20s and 30s have decades to make up shortfalls . The Monitor interviewed four investors to see how they have coped - and what remedial measures , if any , they are taking . All are members of the American Association of Individual Investors , in Chicago , and are fairly sophisticated about finance . They also express patience . Here are their stories , with advice from experts : ' Part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hills , N.J. , takes her investing seriously . She reads " Investor 's Business Daily , " tracks finance-oriented Internet sites , peruses books on finance , and keeps up on details about both her and her husband 's stocks and mutual funds . But , she says , she is not going to panic because of the recent stock-market dive . " A bear market , " she says , " is part of the normal market cycle . " So far , she is neither selling her downtrodden holdings , nor buying . But she sees buying opportunities in coming weeks as the market settles . And she 's sure a rebound will come . " Everything hinges on corporate earnings . When earnings start to rise , the market will rebound , " she says , just as it repeatedly has in past downturns . Ms. Maher , who has two children , ages 4 and 9 , works occasionally as a consultant in the nuclear-engineering field ; her husband is also in the nuclear industry . About 60 percent of the Maher 's investments are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't particularly like bond products . All told , she says , she oversees some 16 mutual funds , six for herself , seven for her husband , and three for her children . She also monitors 22 stocks , including such firms as Cisco Systems , Intel , AOL , Sun Microsystems , and Microsoft . Her fund holdings and her husband 's are similar . She has an aggressive-growth fund ; a large-cap growth fund ; a mid-cap fund ; a value fund , and two sector funds , one in healthcare , and the other in technology . Her husband also has a fund linked to the Standard &; Poors ' 500 Index . Maher refuses to give up on the market , because " history shows the stock market is the best place to make money over time , " she insists . Nor is she soured on high-tech firms such as Microsoft and Intel - " solid companies " with good track records , she says . <p> What Maher most laments is a lack of " good counsel . " She has worked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But it is frustrating trying to get good advice , " she says . She also feels brokers from large , well-known financial firms are trying to hawk " company products , " while smaller discount firms offer little advice . In many cases , she finds that she knows far more about the market than the brokers do . So for now she is doing most of the necessary research herself . <p> Expert advice : David Bendix , president of Bendix Financial Group , Garden City , N.Y. , believes Maher is smart to hang in there . " The market should come back by at least the fourth quarter of this year , " he says . But he thinks she should diversify more , adding some bonds - perhaps municipal bonds if the Mahers are in a high tax bracket . He also recommends buying foreign stocks via mutual funds to diversify away from the US market . Europe looks attractive for growth later this year and next year , he says . ' Down cycles do n't last ' Helen Sonenshine laughs when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she could happily retire . And as a resident of Virginia Beach , Va. , she is close to both sand and surf . But as a woman who thrives on activity , she does n't see retirement happening for some time . She is administrator of a small business . Her husband , Daniel , is a college biology professor . Ms. Sonenshine started investing in earnest in 1985 . That means she has ridden out one major downturn ( 1987 ) , and the explosive bull-market of the 1990s . Today , she has about 70 percent of her holdings in stocks , and 30 percent in mutual funds . She dislikes bonds , which she finds stodgy . She says she is definitely a " buy and hold " investor and plans to hang tough with the market no matter how deep the current downturn goes . " Some of the downturn is psychological , but a lot of it is justified ; there was definitely a bubble , " especially among over-priced technology firms , she says . " Down cycles usually do n't last as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery in the months ahead . She has already engaged in some buying , shoring up positions in firms she already owns , such as Sun Microsystems . Among New-Economy firms , she owns Amgen , Intel , AOL , and Cisco . She also has big-company stocks , including GE , Ford , and Citigroup . She holds no dotcoms , but has some ADRs ( overseas stocks ) , such as Finnish cellphone maker Nokia . To hold down investment expenses , she gets all her stocks through discount brokers on the Internet . She admits that she is short on international holdings . She has one international mutual fund , held through T. Rowe Price . But international funds , she says , have never been " particularly successful " moneymakers for her . The underlying US economy , she says , " remains quite strong . " Sonenshine adds the market rebound will have to come , and she is prepared to wait for it . <p> Expert advice : " Ms. Sonenshine has an interesting plan , " and is probably on target in her assessment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulting firm L.J . Altfest &; Co. , New York . " But it sounds as though she holds too many high-tech firms and large-cap firms . " As conservative as her plan sounds , she is somewhat of a risk-taker , he adds . " It 's still not too late to diversify ... a little . " She could do that by buying a small-cap mutual fund , he says . Still , Mr. Altfest says that she is obviously a careful investor who is investing for the long haul - a characteristic which he finds very admirable . <p> Profits exist for those seeking to ' short ' the market Even as a youngster , Donald Bashline liked math . So little wonder that today finds Mr. Bashline both an actuary , computing the nitty-gritty of workers compensation plans for a Boston firm , and a committed stock investor as well . Bashline has been investing since the 1970s , coming off his " hippie days " in the 60s . With a portfolio in six figures , Bashline has a Keogh account ( a retirement account from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan , and his own trading account of stocks . He has some US government bonds , called TIPS , linked to the inflation rate . He has one international fund - a bond fund - in an IRA . He rents a home in Watertown , Mass. , and owns a small condo in New York City . In his private trading portfolio , Bashline has some six or seven cyclical stocks , including International Paper , First Union Bank , and Lattice Semiconductor Corp . He likes to buy unique new trading instruments , such as Diamonds and Spiders and QQQ . These instruments duplicate certain market indexes . Diamonds track the performance of the Dow Jones industrial average ; Spiders track the S &P; 500 , and QQQ tracks the top 100 companies in the tech-heavy Nasdaq index . Again , using his skills with math , he likes to " short " the market - that is , buy certain stocks that hedge , or bet on the direction of the market . His philosophy , he says , is simple : 1 . Do n't fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a good possibility that the market will eventually move back up . If it does n't drop rates - or does n't cut them enough - there is a good shot that the market may not rebound . 2 . " Do what the market is telling you to do . " You have to gauge the direction and pacing of the market , he says . When it is in the doldrums , be cautious ; when it is barnstorming - barnstorm along with it to a point . Currently , with the market in turmoil and dropping recently , he is not actively trading ; but he " tweaks " his holdings , buying a little here , selling a little there . Not much activity , he stresses , just a little . Bashline , who finds stock trading intellectually stimulating , says that this has been a very difficult market . He did very well last year ; but so far , 2001 has been hard going , with his trading account down maybe six or seven percent . But , he says , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Expert advice : Bashline " should limit his trading to ' what the market is telling him ' to 20 percent or less of his overall portfolio , " argues Lewis J. Altfest , of consulting firm L.J . Altfest &; Co. , New York . The reason : Momentum investing of any type - that is , moving with the market - can be very tricky and very risky . Still , Mr. Altfest finds much that is interesting about Bashline 's strategy . The TIPs are very smart investments , he says , since inflation is still a threat to the US economy . And Bashline is obviously having fun with his investing - that is , using exotic instruments such as Spiders , Diamonds , and QQQ . " But they will all probably underperform in the period ahead , " he says , since major indexes are down . Thus , Bashline should consider diversifying into an international-equity fund , to create a market presence abroad to offset the US market , Altfest says . <p> Investing with a vision 10 years out When Rich Chambers tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stock market , you ca n't help but sit up and listen . Mr. Chambers is a personal financial planner . But Chambers , who heads up Investor 's Capital Management in Palo Alto , Calif. , says that he has to tell it like it is , and right now , plunking huge bundles of new money into the stock market looks shaky at best , risky at worst . If you do go into the market , Chambers says , put in a little at a time through the remainder of the year . That way , you even out your losses and gains in a practice known as dollar-cost averaging . Chambers believes the market has not hit bottom , although it 's " getting close . " Among equity assets , he likes beaten-down value stocks , with their lower price-to-earnings ratios , rather than hot-shot growth stocks with their high price-to-earnings ratios . But Chambers is no fuddy-duddy . He admires New-Economy firms , including high-tech , healthcare , and biotech stocks . His portfolio includes some 200 individual companies and four mutual funds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 401(k) plan from a former job that he rolled into an IRA . Currently , he says , his total holdings are 40 percent in small value stocks , 40 percent in high tech , biotech , and healthcare , 5 percent in special-situations stocks ( a little of this and that ) , and 15 percent in foreign stocks . For all his hesitancy about the market , Chambers believes the stock market is still the best way to invest for the future . Chambers and his wife , Bonnie , have two daughters and the family likes to travel . Their last trip was to Florence , Italy . So investing , both for the present , as well as the future , is crucial . He says he does n't fear volatility , looks out over a long time-horizon of 10 years or more , and buys stocks of quality companies and holds them . He also does n't try to time the market , salts away as much as he can , and uses low-expense discount brokers . <p> Expert advice : " Mr. Chambers has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of Bendix Financial Group . " Buying the overseas stocks through mutual funds makes special sense , since it is hard to find as much good information on non-US as US firms . " Mr. Bendix also likes the fact that Chambers holds biotech firms . Besides being one of the corporate waves of the future , many of them happen to be relatively inexpensive right now , he says . But Bendix wonders if Chambers might hold too many individual stocks . " Even most mutual-fund managers dislike holding 200 companies , " he says , since " it makes it all the harder " to track so many firms . Having that many firms can dilute overall returns , he says . Bendix believes Chambers should narrow his individual holdings down to a more focused portfolio . Finally , when dollar-cost averaging , Bendix would put half of a lump sum amount in the market now , then ease the rest in over the remainder of the year . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2001 .
