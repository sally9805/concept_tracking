<p> For the first time this season , all four Spring Branch schools took on an Aldine ISD school . And for the first time this season , all four area teams suffered losses on the same weekend . <p> In 1998 , when these two districts were paired together for the first time to form District 21-5A , the Spring Branch schools were usually losing by 30 points or more . But recent efforts by SBISD show the tide might be slowly turning to a more level playing field . <p> Even last week 's four losses showed improvement . Memorial , which has been the benchmark for success against AISD with a 5-5 mark , would have gone 2-0 this season if not for a lost fourth-quarter lead over Nimitz . Stratford went into halftime tied with Aldine , and Spring Woods trailed by 27-12 to MacArthur entering the fourth . <p> Northbrook set the clock back somewhat with a 62-7 loss to Aldine and a 60-0 loss to Eisenhower , but those are two of the best teams in the Houston area . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was evident the first year of competition . The Spring Branch schools , having played freshman , junior varsity and varsity games with the Aldine schools , now know what to expect when they take the field . And they 've realized they possess the ability to stay with these teams . <p> " These guys are n't the St. Louis Rams , " first-year Stratford coach Greg McCaig said of the Aldine schools . " You have to respect them , but you ca n't fear them , otherwise you lose before you start . They have more athleticism , but that does n't mean we ca n't compete . " <p> Spring Woods coach Mike Sciba said Memorial 's efforts to this point are case in point . <p> " That 's the whole thing with Spring Branch , " he said . " A lot of our teams are getting confidence and believing we can compete with these people . Memorial showing you can beat these people gives the rest of the district confidence . It paves the way for the rest of the district . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sciba , but he said the Mustangs did n't set out to change the face of competition in the 21-5A . <p> " Based on the scores , it sounds like ( Spring Branch has improved ) , " Koch said . " We feel like we 've been competitive with them , and hopefully we 'll stay competitive . " <p> Memorial - It looked like 1999 was going to repeat itself , when the Mustangs took three of four games from the Aldine schools and finished in a three-way tie for the 21-5A championship . <p> After defeating MacArthur on Sept. 30 for the third straight year , Memorial was eyeing its second victory in a row over Nimitz last week . The Mustangs were six minutes shy of doing so . <p> That 's the amount of time left when the Cougars ( 1-4 overall , 1-1 in 21-5A ) scored the go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter , completing a stunning 24-12 comeback victory in a game that turned on three critical plays . <p> The first critical episode was Nimitz 's conversion of a third-and-10 during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feliciano for a 23-yard scoring pass down the middle of the field with 8:01 to play . <p> Memorial ( 3-2 , 1-1 ) jumped offsides on the extra-point kick , so Nimitz instead took the easy two-point conversion from the one-yard line . <p> The Mustangs smothered the ensuing onside kick , but on an option play , a blitzing Nimitz linebacker forced a fumble and the Cougars took over . Memorial stopped them on a third-and-four , but the Mustangs were again flagged for being offsides . <p> Nimitz scored to own a 16-12 lead with 6:04 to play . <p> Bad weather played a factor in the game . So did Memorial having to settle for two field goals instead of touchdowns in the first half when it reached the red zone . Matt Young , who rushed for 94 yards on 16 carries , booted the field goals from 37 and 22 yards out . <p> " It would have been a significant win for us , but I 'm not counting us out , " Koch said . <p> The Mustangs will be looking to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) 7:30 p.m . Friday at Tully Stadium . <p> Stratford - The Spartans ( 4-1 , 1-1 ) put up some big numbers on a good Aldine squad but could n't avoid the mistakes when the game was on the line . So instead of the upset victory that would have validated Stratford as a playoff contender , Aldine ( 4-1 , 2-0 ) left a 28-16 winner . <p> " We 're making the steps in the right direction , " McCaig said . " I do n't believe in having a good loss , but we did n't back up , we physically competed and we had our chances . " <p> The Spartans had the Mustangs right where they wanted them . They played to a 7-7 tie in the first half with the Stratford defense holding its own , allowing Aldine only one big play on an 82-yard scoring by quarterback Omega Hogan . <p> Spartans running back Justin Patterson scored from three yards out before halftime . Patterson exploited the Aldine defense for 214 yards on 39 carries ( a 5.5-yard average ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 138 yards ) in the third quarter . Stratford came through with a 40-yard gain but was flagged for a motion penalty . <p> Hogan added a second touchdown run in the fourth , and Stratford closed to within 21-14 on quarterback Warren Alexander 's one-yard run with 3:19 to play . <p> But the Stratford defense had its second big breakdown of the game , allowing Roberson to rush for a 55-yard score . <p> " I think they can come back from this , " McCaig said . " What they found out is they can compete with anybody they want to . Now the issue is , how are they going to respond ? " <p> Stratford will face Nimitz ( 1-4 , 1-1 ) at 6 p.m . Saturday at Thorne Stadium , and the same philosophy applies to this game as it did against Aldine . <p> Northbrook - For the second week in a row , the Raiders ( 2-3 , 0-2 ) allowed 60 points to an opponent . This time it happened to be No. 1 Eisenhower ( 5-0 , 2-0 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 495 yards rushing . In Week No. 4 , Aldine crushed the Raiders 62-7 . <p> The lone highlight for Northbrook was the rushing of Kario Edwards , who carried 24 times for 107 yards . The Raiders had just 117 yards total . <p> Eisenhower running back Tony Frazier had three touchdown runs and scored another on a 63-yard punt return . Four other players also scored rushing touchdowns for the Eagles . <p> 21-5A volleyball <p> Memorial continued its roll through 21-5A with a pair of easy victories last week over Eisenhower and Northbrook . <p> Stratford ( 20-8 , 8-1 ) also kept pace for its rematch showdown with the Lady Mustangs ( 23-6 , 9-0 ) , but did n't have it quite as easy . <p> Following the Lady Spartans ' early-week 15-5 , 15-6 win over MacArthur , Spring Woods ( 11-11 , 6-3 ) nearly pulled off the upset on its home court . The Lady Tigers took the first game 15-7 before dropping the next two 15-4 , 15-7 . <p> Standout Stasia Davis had 11 kills in the loss while Stratford countered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Northbrook ( 9-12 , 5-4 ) , despite its 15-4 , 15-2 loss to Memorial , stayed one game back in the race for third place . <p> Second Baptist <p> The Second Baptist Eagles went a long way toward clinching yet another TAPPS Class 4A playoff berth by defeating Victoria St. Joseph 's 14-7 in a TAPPS 4-4A football game last Friday night . <p> Second Baptist ( 5-2 overall , 3-0 in 4-4A ) will take on Lutheran South in a conference game at 7:30 p.m . Friday . <p> Lutheran South enters the game 2-3 overall and 1-1 in the league after falling to Lutheran North 44-12 last week . <p> " Lutheran South is having a pretty rough year , " Second Baptist head coach Lawrence Hutson said . " But we ca n't take anything for granted . We have to go about preparing for them like we do anybody else . We have to take it one step at a time . " <p> Allen Page scored on a pair of short runs in the second quarter to lead the Eagles to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards on 20 carries . <p> Jay Osborn completed three of nine passes for 19 yards , while the Eagles outgained St. Joseph 's 298-139 yards . <p> " We had a good rushing game out of Allen Page , " Hutson said . " It is not uncommon for us to use three or four tailbacks , but he got rolling and we dialed his number a lot late in the game . " <p> Hutson said offensive tackles Aaron Shelley and John Bruyere , guards Bradley Talbert and Glen Oskin and center Ben Jennings were effective up front . <p> Volleyball - The Lady Eagles ( 12-10 , 3-3 in TAPPS 4-4A ) lost to St. Pius 17-15 , 15-3 last week . Carrie Ford had nine kills . <p> Westside <p> The Westside football team ( 3-2 , 0-2 in District 17-5A ) hopes the third time is the charm when the Wolves play Bellaire in a must-win conference game at 7 p.m .

Ron Adams had 52 yards rushing on 10 carries . Jerral Luna hit five of 10 passes for 45 yards . <p> The Wolves defense also improved from the Madison game , holding Lamar to 307 total yards . <p> Volleyball - The Lady Wolves ( 7-12 , 5-4 in District 17-5A ) lost to Madison 14-16 , 15-4 , 8-15 and Bellaire 15-0 , 15-0 last week . <p> Emily Rogers had 10 kills in the loss to Madison . <p> Kinkaid <p> The Kinkaid Falcons ( 5-1 , 3-1 in SPC play ) rebounded from a tough loss to Dallas Greenhill to defeat Dallas St. Mark 's 35-0 in a SPC Division I game last week . <p> Kinkaid now will try to stay alive for the SPC title when it plays host to Fort Worth Country Day at 4 p.m .

It must be submitted for federal approval by a legal deadline at the end of the year . <p> With the world 's largest petrochemical complex and a world-class hunger for electricity , the Houston area 's character is largely defined by industry . <p> But for all their benefits , the many oil , chemical and power plants here also release half , or more , of the air pollution that creates the metropolitan region 's nation-leading ozone problem . A respiratory irritant , ozone is smog 's main ingredient . <p> While the state 's smog proposal would reduce pollution from automotive and other sources , it calls for industrial facilities to do the most to reduce emissions . <p> That demand is spelled out in more than 200 pages of technically complex rules with differing limits for various types of polluting equipment . Taken together , they would mean an average 90 percent cut in the key ozone-forming pollutant that the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is produced whenever combustion occurs - in the region 's millions of car and truck engines , for instance , as well as its multitude of industrial boilers , furnaces , burners , turbines , heaters and kilns . <p> Insisting that its more than 120 member companies want to do their share to reduce ozone levels , the Business Coalition for Clean Air is arguing for a less stringent mandate . <p> The coalition is a project of the Greater Houston Partnership , the area 's leading advocate for business and industry . It says a 75 percent reduction in nitrogen oxide is all that is now technically and economically feasible , averaged across all Houston-area plants . <p> The group also argues that a 75 percent requirement would roughly equate to the strictest level of control mandated anywhere - even in the Los Angeles region . <p> Even some industry officials say a 90 percent requirement is more viable than the coalition says , however , and the ensuing debate has turned into much more than a bureaucratic numbers game . <p> If Texas officials decide to order less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would either have to make up the difference with rules that hit other pollution sources or run the risk of submitting a smog plan without as many emission cuts as federal officials say are needed . <p> Under the Clean Air Act , a plan that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency judges inadequate to meet the national health standard for ozone could bring a federally designed smog plan . It also could trigger a cutoff in transportation funds and tighter limits on industrial growth . <p> Key business officials argue that a 90 percent cut would hamstring industrial growth , leaving no room for extra emission reductions required to offset future expansion . <p> The Business Coalition continued to press such arguments Friday with a preview of a new economic study for TNRCC officials and other state leaders in Austin . The study , to be released publicly this week , estimates the total capital costs of compliance with the 90 percent rule at about $ 7 billion , said Barton Smith , director of the University of Houston 's Institute for Regional Forecasting . <p> The TNRCC 's executive director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Friday , and the agency 's three commissioners will decide on its ingredients early next month . <p> In an interview last week , TNRCC Executive Director Jeff Saitas , an engineer widely recognized for his expertise on industrial operations , was skeptical about dire economic predictions . <p> " Smart people in a competitive marketplace will find a way to do it cheaper , " he said . <p> Some environmentalists have voiced concern that the TNRCC would relax the 90 percent number after the presidential campaign , in which Gov . George W. Bush used the proposal to defend his record against criticism by Vice President Al Gore . <p> Saitas would not reveal what he will recommend on the question this week , but he indicated he was inclined to stick with a stringent mandate . <p> " At this point , I have n't seen enough justification to say that 90 percent is not an appropriate requirement , " he said . <p> " Ninety percent was n't a made-up number , " he said . " A lot of research went into it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise we would n't have proposed it . " <p> Saitas said , however , that he may be swayed by industry contentions that the mandate 's timing is too ambitious : " I 'm seriously considering when it should occur . " <p> The state proposal calls for industrial sources to complete the work needed for a 90 percent cut by the end of 2004 . But the Business Coalition is asking for a timetable ending in early 2007 . The group asserts that it will take that long to obtain needed materials , hire enough workers and do the design work necessary to retrofit scores of complicated industrial facilities with new pollution controls . <p> Under the Clean Air Act , Houston is required to comply with the ozone standard in the three-year period running from 2005-07 . But federal rules allow the EPA to push that deadline to 2007-09 , under certain conditions , to allow for later introduction of some control measures . <p> The smog plan 's mandate for local industrial facilities will require " a huge remodeling exercise , " said Doug Deason , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have little or no experience with the environmental technologies it would demand , he said . <p> Essentially , the coalition and TNRCC officials have agreed on one key point : With technology now proven and in use , getting to 90 percent will require many local facilities to use a two-tier approach . <p> First , burners would have to be modified to reduce nitrogen oxide production at the point of combustion . Then , the resulting exhausts would have to be cleaned up further . Business Coalition representatives assert that this would often require the use of equipment akin to the catalytic converters on cars and trucks . <p> Using this second , catalytic device presents assorted challenges , as Equistar officials pointed out on a recent tour of their Channelview chemical plant organized by the Business Coalition . In some places , where plant equipment is already closely crowded together , the catalytic equipment might have to be built above existing units , but that approach raises questions about structural integrity and hurricane worthiness , they said . <p> " Will the steel hold that much weight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith , citing what he said was a common question that will be asked at many area plants . <p> One major oil and chemical company , BP ( formerly BP Amoco ) , has raised doubts about the Business Coalition 's arguments . In September , the company said it can come close to a 90 percent emission cut at four area plants , which BP said are typical of others in the area . <p> Last month , BP elaborated on that pledge , explaining that its biggest step toward a 90 percent cut will be the construction of new cogeneration units to produce both steam and enough power so some can be sold to defray costs . <p> In so do , company officials say they can replace older , dirtier units , including furnaces like the ones other companies are talking about retrofitting . <p> BP , which portrays itself as especially sensitive to environmental concerns , has drawn an implicit , but clear , contrast between its approach and the Business Coalition 's position . <p> " While others are fighting the process and casting doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollution and to doing what we think is part of the solution to air quality in and around Houston , " said Tim Scruggs , vice president of BP 's Texas City business unit in a formal announcement . <p> Confronted with this challenge from within the petrochemical industry itself , the Business Coalition was thrust into a defensive mode . In a policy statement developed after BP 's pronouncements , the group said : <p> " We have stated publicly all along that newly constructed boilers and heaters can achieve 90 percent nitrogen oxide reductions by applying latest technology . " <p> While acknowledging that some companies " may be capable of making significant business investments , " the coalition said it does not believe " that all sources , large and small , will have the financial resources to make such investments . " <p> Coalition chairman Charles Duncan said the group strongly supports getting Houston into compliance with the ozone standard and is not trying to shift some of industry 's emission-cutting obligation onto the public . <p> Duncan said the coalition favors other ways to make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandate . They include reducing pollution from other business sources with measures like market-based incentives and new federal rules for activities that state officials can not regulate under the Clean Air Act , he said . <p> Meanwhile , key environmentalists are not persuaded by arguments that an average 90 percent reduction is not feasible at industrial plants . <p> " I 'm always skeptical , " said Jim Marston , Texas director of Environmental Defense . His group played a key role in negotiating a 1999 state law that ordered an average 50 percent cut in nitrogen oxide emissions by utility plants statewide . <p> Environmental Defense initially proposed only a 30 percent cut , but utility companies said more than 22 percent would cause electricity prices to skyrocket and cause brownouts , Marston said . <p> Utility leaders later agreed to the 50 percent mandate , which was included in the electricity deregulation bill that the industry wanted passed . This fall , Reliant Energy , which serves the Houston area , said it can achieve an 88 percent cut . <p> " I remember their claims that lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

He and his staff also built an elaborate stage and catwalk , painted Venetian murals and provided chairs and black-and-white checkered linens on each tabletop . <p> " People walk into a room and say , ' Oh , that 's nice , ' but they have no idea what goes on behind the scenes to make it happen , " McMahon said . <p> Richard Soler , who runs Make Believe , one of the other major party production companies in Houston , got into the business after earning a graduate degree in art history and working as a museum curator . <p> " I had done a lot of academic work and scholarly work , " Soler said . " I decided I wanted to be an artist . " <p> As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would do the decor for a gala . Soler turned a ballroom into a Swedish palace from the 18th century , laden with paintings and sculpture that he created himself . <p> " It 's all about illusion . It has to look solid and permanent , but it 's not , " Soler said . " It should look like it 's been there for a long time . " <p> That was 15 years ago . As Houston has recovered from an oil bust and basked in a robust economy , the gala circuit has gotten busier . <p> " It is a big industry , " Soler said . " And it has gotten bigger and bigger as times have gotten better . " <p> An ever-growing tide of galas can mean brutal schedules for the people who produce them . <p> " I worked 42 hours straight at New Year 's , " Fly said . " We did parties at the Tremont Hotel , the Galvez and a Red Cross gala on the ice rink of the Galleria . We had to schedule naps for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fly took Labor Day off but has not had a full , staffwide day off since then . <p> The party circuit kicks into high gear in September and keeps humming through the holidays . It will take a short break after the New Year and pick up again in February . The party season runs through May , then takes a break for the broiling summer months , a time when many high-society types jet off to their swankiendas in Santa Fe , Monaco or some such place . <p> They return in September , and the circuit gets busy - with a vengeance . There will be a significant fund-raising event several nights each week . Sometimes , multiple galas crowd into a single day . <p> " Houston probably raises more money for charity that any other city in America . It is a very generous city , " said Richard Flowers , who owns Richard Flowers and Associates , perhaps the heaviest hitter in the local party production business . " In Houston , the galas are entertainment . People buy tables and invite their friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I do work in other cities , it is mostly for private , political or corporate functions . " <p> To the cynical , these balls are less about charity and more about status-mongering . Millionaires peel off a few extra bills in the presence of their chums to purchase additional social standing . <p> But there is no doubt about galas ' effectiveness in raising money . True believers gather in a big room with people they hope to tap for cash . Heartfelt speeches are delivered . <p> Video presentations add emotional punch , sometimes showing heartbreaking scenes of people suffering and dying for lack of help . Wine flows to relax financial inhibitions . Once the auction begins , the thrill of the hunt is added to the list of other incentives provided to give in and ante up . <p> " These events are big business , " Watson said . " And if you have an event that is trying to raise $ 500,000 or more , you have to create a certain image . . . . Houston has a very sophisticated fund-raising scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Huge , over-the-top props are a favored part of creating the right image . For a University of Houston Sports Hall of Fame gala , Soler sculpted a massive cougar out of polystyrene . Standing 35 feet high , the cat was red and gold and surrounded by a canopy of giant stars . <p> Staging a birthday celebration for George and Barbara Bush , Fly and her staff transformed the stark Astroarena into a party space with decorations built around the theme of the Bush family 's personal interests . One prop was a mannequin parachuting from the ceiling , a nod to the former president 's skydiving adventure on his 75th birthday . <p> The best tables at the party cost $ 100,000 , and the guest list included former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and film star Bruce Willis . The event , which included dinner , a concert and a fireworks display , raised an eye-popping $ 10.1 million for the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center <p> Flowers regularly produces the opulent Houston Grand Opera ball , which netted about $ 800,000 this year . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Flowers and his crew constructed 45-foot-high obelisks and covered the walls of the Wortham Center with 65-foot-high murals of Egyptian scenes . The gala included fireworks , a belly dancer and a camel . <p> " There are a lot of events to go to , " Flowers said . " Everyone has their own causes - the symphony ball , the opera ball , the ballet ball , the Alley ball , the museum ball and so forth . But as a gala becomes more and more over-the-top , it makes it easier to sell out the next year . " <p> After a big shindig is over and the party hats are packed away , crews come in during the wee hours and haul the huge props back to warehouses . Many of them will be dusted off , spruced up and appear again at an event down the road . <p> Let It Fly 's warehouses are stuffed with old wagon wheels , leather saddles , suits of knightly armor , Egyptian mummy cases and Tiki torches . Last month 's Rainforest Foundation gala included 40 palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stowed away , awaiting some other tropical party . <p> " We never throw anything away , " Fly said . " Somebody called me about doing a " Survivor " party for her husband 's 40th birthday . I 've got Tiki torches , life preservers , palm trees - it 's a " Survivor " party . " <p> TYPE : - LINKS- @55900 <p> The car was our undoing . An ancient , rusting black Ford , it sat abandoned on rotted tires under a canopy of old live oaks , their roots lifting as if resisting earth 's embrace . <p> That the window glass was long gone and the cracked leather seats scratched bare legs did n't matter . The steering wheel , pedals and gearshift moved without doing anything , and the horn was mute . But Jody 's brother Charlie , two years older at 12 , could mimic realistic ah-oogas and an engine revving up . Five years of dedicated violin study had developed his keen ear for sounds . <p> Like mine , their parents had firmly declared an area edging our 1942 Heights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swimming pools were closed because of a raging polio epidemic , so our usual summer-vacation haunts were out of bounds . Soon tiring of board games , we slipped off to explore the woods , about two blocks from our next-door houses . We meant to go only once , but the old car 's lure kept drawing us back . <p> Despite qualms of conscience , we lied about going to the playground when we took imaginary trips in the vintage vehicle . We took turns " driving , " the passengers urging dolls on the back seat to behave . " No , we 're not there yet ! " someone would say . Or , " Pipe down , or the car stops ! " And , " Do n't forget to kiss Grandpa , even if he forgot to shave again . " <p> Adopted as toddlers by a Methodist minister and his wife , Charlie and Jody were religious but questioning . Chewing on Tootsie Rolls or Milk Duds , we probed notions of God , debating whether he was a white-bearded man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven was on a distant planet , like the moon or Mars . Though in agreement as to God 's existence , we never reached a satisfactory conclusion as to what he was like , or where he lives . <p> Charlie doubted the " he " part , saying a power that creates everything has no need for gender . Such heavy thinking gave me a headache . Charlie said not to worry ; if we were meant to know the answers , we already would - that just trying to do right and being nice was enough for now . <p> He was the only boy I knew who did n't mind playing with girls our age . Most boys rarely associated with him , but he did n't seem to notice . Small-boned , with chiseled features and a mop of dark hair , Charlie was nice , more than could be said of those who taunted him for his good manners and love of classical music . <p> A few furtive visits to the woods convinced us that not being allowed there was merely another arbitrary adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'd seen no wild animals , and not a single stranger like those we 'd been warned about . Surely , we thought , no danger could exist so close to home . <p> Jody was driving one afternoon while I tracked time on my Little Orphan Annie watch . We did n't want an overstay to make an anxious mother check the playground or Charlie to miss his 4 o'clock violin lesson . It was almost time to go when two approaching boys made us groan . <p> Buddy and his twin , Bryce , both oversized for 13 , lived on our street . We 'd lost lunch money to their fists waving in our faces , a practice that stopped after our daddies spoke to theirs . From our front porches we heard the howls when they got a licking . Daddy wondered if the frequent harsh punishment they received might have something to do with their negative behavior . <p> Wet denim shorts and T-shirts stuck to the twins ' sturdy bodies . " Bet you girls 're too chicken to swim where we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puglike , sunburned face alit on Charlie . " Hey , I 'm talking at you , too , sissy boy ! " <p> The sullen Bryce jerked Charlie out of the car . Buddy 's bruising grip on our arms forced Jody and me to follow them deeper into the woods . Jody squealed in protest and got a twisting cheek pinch to shut her up . I was moved along like a limp rag , stomach churning at how terrible Buddy smelled . <p> " Scaredy-cat girls ! Wacky sissy boy , " he kept saying . <p> He swore he 'd get us good if we told this time and made us promise not to . Charlie looked scared but said nothing . <p> We came to a sagging lean-to made of fruit crates , where a plywood sign bore a painted skull and crossbones . Crude lettering warned the world to " STAY OUT PRIVATE . " <p> " This is our clubhouse , " Buddy announced . " Y'all better never mess with it , neither ! " <p> A few yards away was a quarry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brackish , amber-green water . Buddy turned Jody over to Bryce , then pressed a knotted rope end in my hand . The other end was tied to a thick branch stretching over the water . <p> " Get up there , girl , and jump on in for a nice swim ! Jody 's comin ' next . " <p> I cried when he shoved me toward the tree . Still held by Bruce , Charlie asked Buddy to let us go . " The girls do n't swim very well , " he said . <p> Buddy just laughed . " Yeah ? Then you do it , sissy boy . " He yanked Charlie away from Bryce and over to the tree . Charlie 's face beaded with nervous sweat when he pried my frozen fingers from the rope . " It 'll be OK , " he whispered . <p> I darted back to Jody . Bryce kept hold of us to prevent an escape attempt . <p> " No , Charlie . Do n't ! " cried Jody . " You barely swim yourself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie awkwardly climb slats nailed to the tree trunk . I shut my eyes when Charlie slowly stepped out to teeter on the limb . Sports held little interest for him , but his wiriness hid strength his mother relied on for opening jars with stubborn lids . Jody said playing the violin had made his hands strong . <p> She screamed , " Charlie , come down , please ! " <p> I looked up . His legs were wobbling , but he clung fast to the rope . Bryce was having second thoughts . " Hey , Buddy . We do n't need no bad trouble . Maybe we ought a call it off . " <p> Buddy whirled to glare at him . " Hell , no ! It might straighten him out ! " <p> Behind his back , Charlie swung down on the rope - not over the water , but with feet aimed right at Buddy . Bryce had no chance to cry a warning as his twin was propelled into the quarry , his head hitting a rocky edge before he sank from sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet . Bryce let go of Jody and me to run over and gawk at the spot where Buddy disappeared . " Come on ! " Charlie yelled . We raced off , Bryce 's call for help sounding behind us . A loud splash let us know he 'd jumped in to look for his brother . <p> Stumbling over tree roots with pounding hearts , we raced home . Daddy was just home from work and went white when I gasped out what had happened . He called the police , then hurried off to the woods . Mother gave us a scolding that grounded me for a month for disobedience . She quieted when a wailing ambulance and a police car whipped past . " Thank God you 're all OK , " she murmured . <p> Daddy returned shortly to pump Charlie 's hand . " That Bryce is mad , but he admitted what they 'd done . It was the brothers ' fault . I 'm grateful for your courage and smart thinking . " He told us Bryce had pulled Buddy out just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Charlie brooded that he might have inadvertently killed Buddy but was assured he 'd been given no choice . <p> Jody later told me the reverend was disappointed about the lying but felt we 'd learned a valuable lesson in the consequences of misbehaving . He was , however , proud of Charlie . <p> He tried to counsel the twins ' parents about better ways to keep them in line than whippings , but the punishment only increased . <p> After stealing a car in July , Buddy and Bryce were sent to a juvenile detention facility . My family moved away that fall , and the reverend took a pulpit in Dallas soon afterward . We never knew the ultimate fate of the brothers but hoped they got straightened out . <p> Jody , Charlie and I kept in touch over the years . One of her sons is now a concert pianist , and a daughter plays cello . Charlie 's talent led to a brilliant career , finally with the San Francisco Symphony , where he played for more than 20 years . <p> I sadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Charlie 's music and brave , gentle life came to an end . <p> TYPE : - LINKS- @55901 <p> Dmitri Shostakovich was a survivor . <p> For almost seven decades , he lived - tensely - under Russia 's communist government . Twice it attacked him , ferociously , for his artistic " waywardness . " He responded , often subversively , by composing some of the most moving works of the 20th century . <p> He was the great symphonist of his era . Many of his 15 symphonies are now considered masterpieces . The Fifth is standard repertoire . <p> Similarly , as a group his 15 string quartets are viewed as successors to great sets by Beethoven and Bartok . The Emerson String Quartet 's recent complete recording is an eloquent confirmation . <p> Above all , his opera " Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk " is so powerful that operaphiles race to see it when it shows up on a company 's schedule . <p> But Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk also brought the weight of Josef Stalin 's government down on Shostakovich .

Within two years it received 83 performances there and 97 in Moscow . <p> But on Jan. 28 , 1936 , the government newspaper Pravda attacked the opera . " Chaos instead of Music , " proclaimed the headline . The story characterized the music as " fidgety , screaming , neurotic " and " coarse , primitive and vulgar . " <p> " That article on the third page of Pravda changed my entire existence , " Shostakovich wrote in Testimony , his controversial memoir . " It was printed without a signature , like an editorial - that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party . But it actually expressed the opinion of Stalin , and that was much more important . " <p> Soviets read the article as a warning against modernism . Longtime friends abandoned Shostakovich , and he went into artistic exile . From then on , his life and music vacillated between his natural instincts and the need to survive . <p> He answered the attack via his music . His Fifth Symphony ( 1937 ) was " the creative reply of a Soviet artist to justified criticism , " according to an anonymous characterization that Shostakovich accepted . <p> The work brought him back into favor . His public acceptance grew , peaking in the middle of World War II with the Symphony No. 7 , Leningrad . Shostakovich was in the city during the German siege and wrote the first three movements there . <p> The work was a propaganda coup at its premiere in 1942 . A microfilm of the score was flown to the United States , where Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony played it on national radio in July . <p> The Seventh Symphony became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans , Shostakovich became the resistance 's face . Time magazine decked him out in a fireman 's helmet for a cover picture . <p> Shostakovich had not become a conformist , though . His Eighth Symphony was denounced , and his Ninth Symphony deeply offended Stalin . <p> The Ninth celebrated the end of World War II . Shostakovich was expected to follow the tradition of Beethoven 's monumental Ninth , but there were no soloists , chorus or exultant music in the new work . Rather , it had a lighthearted , almost flippant gaiety . <p> " I could n't write an apotheosis to Stalin , " he said in Testimony . " I simply could n't . I knew what I was in for when I wrote the Ninth . " <p> Accordingly , Shostakovich , composer Sergey Prokofiev and several other prominent Soviets were denounced in a 1948 decree as notorious as the " Chaos instead of Music " article . <p> They were accused of representing " most strikingly the formalistic perversions and anti-democratic tendencies in music " - " the cult of atonality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best they could . Shostakovich said publicly that he had tried to remove the " pernicious elements " from his music but that the process was incomplete . <p> The official denunciation sharpened Shostakovich 's retreat to a dual life : a public figure as pliant in music and action as he could be , and a private citizen who poured his feelings into music that often went unperformed for many years . <p> The bitterest response was Anti-Formalist Rayok ( Satiric Opera ) , an ironic cantata-plus-text about " the struggles of the realistic and formalist directions in music . " Written mostly in 1957 , it was a merciless , often scatological attack on the rules for composing politically correct music and the officials who issued them . <p> The first performance occurred in Washington in 1989 , led by the Soviet emigre cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich . <p> Had authorities known of the existence of Anti-Formalist Rayok , " ( Shostakovich ) could have been shot , " said Dmitri Feofanov . A pianist and lawyer , he is co-author with musicologist Allan B. Ho of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rayok before Friday 's performance . <p> " He was suicidally brave at times , " Feofanov said . <p> Stalin died in 1953 , and Shostakovich 's circumstances began to improve . <p> In 1962 , Lady Macbeth was reinstated , under a different title , and hailed as a masterpiece of theatrical realism . <p> The same year , he wrote the Babi Yar Symphony . It was instantaneously controversial because of Yevtushenko 's poetry . Now it is viewed as one of Shostakovich 's greatest compositions . <p> Shostakovich died in 1975 , but the controversies surrounding his life did n't stop . <p> In 1979 came Testimony : The Memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich , " as related to and edited by Solomon Volkov , " a Soviet musicologist . <p> The publication provoked war among musicians and scholars over the book 's accuracy and veracity - disputes that now seem settled by the exhaustive 1998 study by Feofanov and Ho , who support Testimony . <p> " For a lot of people , Testimony was a Rosetta stone . It helped them understand Shostakovich , " Feofanov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolve from third-rate hack to musical giant . <p> Part of Shostakovich 's message was that his true self can be found in the music - and musicians are still finding astonishing evidence of that , Feofanov said . Recently , a scholar discovered that the Twelfth Symphony ( 1961 ) , which Shostakovich dedicated " To the Memory of Lenin , " is permeated by a tune from Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk . <p> In his introduction in the Shostakovich Festival program book , Russian scholar Manashir Abramovich Iakubov explores such dualities . <p> " Shostakovich was acutely sensitive , in a way that no one else was , to the ambiguity of all that went on around him , to those glimmering , elusive double-meanings that everything possessed , but which we ourselves have only recently begun to acknowledge as an agonizing aspect of our former physical , social and psychological lives , " Iabukov writes . <p> Shostakovich could link the lyric to the grotesque , joy and irony , hope and despair - and shift between them instantaneously in his music . <p> " His music has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . It is this capacity to give shape to actuality that guarantees his art will endure , " Iabukov writes . <p> It will also give him the last word . <p> University of Houston Shostakovich Festival <p> When : 7:30 p.m .

Bush 's campaign plane landed in Erie , Pa. , with the candidate , Colin Powell , Pennsylvania Gov . Tom Ridge and the usual contingent of bodyguards and media representatives on board . <p> As the chartered 757 touched down , a passenger in the press section looked out his window and promptly reported that the engine on his side of the plane was emitting smoke . <p> There were a couple of nervous jokes , but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crowd of several thousand supporters who had been waiting for him in an airport hangar . <p> " Yes , there was smoke , lots of it , " a Secret Service agent later told an inquiring reporter , who just happened to be as concerned about his safety as he was about his next deadline . <p> " But that 's normal , " the agent added . <p> Normal ? <p> Oddly enough , that was about the only time anyone used that word during this entire presidential race . And it certainly is the last word that comes to mind in trying to describe the crazy Election Night that does n't want to end . <p> Even in " normal " presidential elections , most " normal " people do n't submit themselves and their families to the physical , mental and emotional rigors of running for the Free World 's highest office . <p> The day that Bush 's plane landed in Erie had begun in Tampa , Fla. , included a stop in Pittsburgh and ended in Toledo , Ohio . It was the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nine states . <p> And it was by no means either Bush 's or Al Gore 's most strenuous week . For Bush , it was the next-to-last full week of a 17-month campaign , and its pace was almost a cakewalk compared to the frenetic final push that would begin a few days later . <p> By Election Day , both Bush and Gore were to be congratulated for simply being able to stand , much less utter a string of coherent sentences . <p> From day one , this presidential race was n't normal because Bush was perceived as the early favorite . <p> This comment is intended as absolutely no reflection on Bush 's abilities or his proposed policies . But he was the less-experienced challenger trying to unseat a member of an incumbent administration during prosperous economic times . Normally , Gore should have been able to let the " good times " theme roll him into the White House . <p> But the Clinton-Gore administration was n't normal either . Presidents normally are n't caught in sex scandals with White House interns . They normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Lincoln bedroom . And their vice presidents normally do n't attend political fund-raisers at Buddhist temples . <p> The Clinton-Gore team had simply worn out its welcome with many voters and handed Bush the character issue . <p> Maybe it should n't be so surprising , after all , that this particular presidential race is ending the way it is . But that does n't make the vote recount in Florida , the looming lawsuits and the continuing uncertainty any less frustrating for the candidates , their campaign workers and , most importantly , the American voters . <p> Judges should think twice before interfering with election returns in Florida or anywhere else . Outright fraud - which so far has n't been alleged - could merit judicial attention , but returns should n't be challenged just because some voters were confused by their ballots . <p> Their confusion was unfortunate , but it hardly violated their constitutional rights . <p> The winner of the Electoral College vote is legitimately the next president , and , so far , that appears to be Bush . Whether Bush received the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Maybe the Electoral College should be abolished , but that 's another issue for another day . <p> The dispute over the election returns is a political dispute that hardly amounts to a constitutional crisis , at least not yet . <p> This unusual election , however , is clearly a case for the history books , and the sooner it gets there , the better . <p> TYPE : - LINKS-  ; Editorial Opinion
