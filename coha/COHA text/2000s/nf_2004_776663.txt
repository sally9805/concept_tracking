The Two Nations // In the backlash imagination , America is always in a state of quasi-civil war : on one side are the unpretentious millions of authentic Americans ; on the other stand the bookish , all-powerful liberals who run the country but are contemptuous of the tastes and beliefs of the people who inhabit it . When the chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1992 announced to a national TV audience , " We are America " and " those other people are not , " he was merely giving new and more blunt expression to a decades-old formula . Newt Gingrich 's famous description of Democrats as " the enemy of normal Americans " was just one more winning iteration of this well-worn theme . // The current installment of this fantasy is the story of " the two Americas , " the symbolic division of the country that , after the presidential election of 2000 , captivated not only backlashers but a sizable chunk of the pundit class . The idea found its inspiration in the map of the electoral results that year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " space ( the networks all used red to designate Republican victories ) where people voted for George W. Bush , and those tiny little " blue " coastal areas where people lived in big cities and voted for Al Gore . On the face of it there was nothing really remarkable about these red and blue blocs , especially , since in terms of the popular vote the contest was essentially a tie . // Still , many commentators divined in the 2000 map a baleful cultural cleavage , a looming crisis over identity and values . " This nation has rarely appeared more divided than it does right now , " moaned David Broder , the Washington Post ' s pundit-in-chief , in a story published a few days after the election . The two regions were more than mere voting blocs ; they were complete sociological profiles , two different Americas at loggerheads with each other . // And these pundits knew-before election night was over and just by looking at the map-what those two Americas represented . Indeed , the explanation was ready to go before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the thirties has been a working-class movement that for once takes their side of the issues , that votes Republican and reverses the achievements of working-class movements of the past . In the starkly divided red/blue map of 2000 they thought they saw it being realized : the old Democratic regions of the South and the Great Plains were on their team now , solid masses of uninterrupted red , while the Democrats were restricted to the old-line , blueblood states of the Northeast , along with the hedonist left coast . // I do not want to minimize the change that this represents . Certain parts of the Midwest were once so reliably leftist that the historian Walter Prescott Webb , in his classic 1931 history of the region , pointed to its persistent radicalism as one of the " Mysteries of the Great Plains . " Today the mystery is only heightened ; it seems inconceivable that the Midwest was ever thought of as a " radical " place , as anything but the land of the bland , the easy snoozing flyover . Readers in the thirties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Webb was talking about , since so many of the great political upheavals of their part of the twentieth century were launched from the territory west of the Ohio River . The region as they knew it was what gave the country Socialists like Eugene Debs , fiery progressives like Robert La Follette , and practical unionists like Walter Reuther ; it spawned the anarchist IWW and the coldly calculating UAW ; and it was periodically convulsed in gargantuan and often bloody industrial disputes . They might even have known that there were once Socialist newspapers in Kansas and Socialist voters in Oklahoma and Socialist mayors in Milwaukee , and that there were radical farmers across the region forever enlisting in militant agrarian organization with names like the Farmers ' Alliance , or the Farmer-Labor Party , or the Non-Partisan League , or the Farm Holiday Association . And they would surely have been aware that Social Security , the basic element of the liberal welfare state , was largely a product of the midwestern mind . // Almost all of these associations have evaporated today . That the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Midwest now regards the welfare state as an alien imposition ; that we have trouble even believing there was a time when progressives were described with adjectives like fiery , rather than snooty or bossy or wimpy - has to stand as one of the great reversals of American history . // So when the electoral map of 2000 is compared to that of 1896-the year of the showdown between the " great commoner , " William Jennings Bryan , and the voice of business , William McKinley-a remarkable inversion is indeed evident . Bryan was a Nebraskan , a leftist , and a fundamentalist Christian , an almost unimaginable combination today , and in 1896 he swept most of the country outside the Northeast and upper Midwest , which stood rock-solid for industrial capitalism . George W. Bush 's advisers love to compare their man to McKinley , and armed with the electoral map of 2000 the president 's fans are able to envisage the great contest of 1896 refought with optimal results : the politics of McKinley chosen by the Middle America of Bryan . // From this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply veered off into authoritative-sounding cultural proclamation . Just by looking at the map , they reasoned , we could easily tell that George W. Bush was the choice of the plain people , the grassroots Americans who inhabited the place we know as the " heartland , " a region of humility , guilelessness , and , above all , stout yeoman righteousness . The Democrats , on the other hand , were the party of the elite . Just by looking at the map we could see that liberals were sophisticated , wealthy , and materialistic . While the big cities blued themselves shamelessly , the land knew what it was about and went Republican , by a margin in square miles of four to one . // The attraction of such a scheme for conservatives was powerful and obvious . The red-state narrative brought majoritarian legitimacy to a president who had actually lost the popular vote . It also allowed conservatives to present their views as the philosophy of a region that Americans-even sophisticated urban ones-traditionally venerate as the repository of national virtue , a place of plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped conservatives perform one of their dearest rhetorical maneuvers , which we will call the latte libel : the suggestion that liberals are identifiable by their tastes and consumer preferences and that these tastes and preferences reveal the essential arrogance and foreignness of liberalism . While a more straightforward discussion of politics might begin by considering the economic interests that each party serves , the latte libel insists that such interests are irrelevant . Instead it 's the places that people live and the things that they drink , eat , and drive that are the critical factors , the clues that bring us to the truth . In particular , the things that liberals are said to drink , eat , and drive : the Volvos , the imported cheese , and above all , the lattes. // The red-state/blue-state idea appeared to many in the media to be a scientific validation of this familiar stereotype , and before long it was a standard element of the media 's pop-sociology repertoire . The " two Americas " idea became a hook for all manner of local think pieces ( blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minnesota , but my , how different those two Minnesotas are ) ; it provided an easy tool for contextualizing the small stories ( red Americans love a certain stage show in Vegas , but blue Americans do n't ) or for spinning the big stories ( John Walker Lindh , the American who fought for the Taliban , was from California and therefore a reflection of blue-state values ) ; and it justified countless USA Today - style contemplations of who we Americans really are , meaning mainly investigations of the burning usual-what we Americans like to listen to , watch on TV , or buy at the supermarket . // Red America , these stories typically imply , is a mysterious place whose thoughts and values are essentially foreign to society 's masters . Like the " Other America " of the sixties or the " Forgotten Men " of the thirties , its vast stretches are tragically ignored by the dominant class-that is , the people who write the sitcoms and screenplays and the stories in glossy magazines , all of whom , according to the conservative commentator Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places . " Which is particularly unfair of them , impudent even , because Red America is in fact the real America , the part of the country where reside , as a column in the Canadian National Post put it , " the original values of America 's founding . " // And since many of the pundits who were hailing the virtues of the red states-pundits , remember , who were conservatives and who supported George W. Bush-actually , physically lived in blue states that went for Gore , the rules of this idiotic game allowed them to present the latte libel in the elevated language of the confession . David Brooks , who has since made a career out of projecting the liberal stereotype onto the map , took to the pages of The Atlantic magazine to admit on behalf of everyone who lives in a blue zone that they are all snobs , toffs , wusses , ignoramuses , and utterly out of touch with the authentic life of the people . // We in the coastal metro Blue areas read more books and attend more plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more sophisticated and cosmopolitan-just ask us about our alumni trips to China or Provence , or our interest in Buddhism . But do n't ask us , please , what life in Red America is like . We do n't know . We do n't know who Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins are .... We do n't know what James Dobson says on his radio program , which is listened to by millions . We do n't know about Reba and Travis .... Very few of us know what goes on in Branson , Missouri , even though it has seven million visitors a year , or could name even five NASCAR drivers .... We do n't know how to shoot or clean a rifle . We ca n't tell a military officer 's rank by looking at his insignia . We do n't know what soy beans look like when they 're growing in a field . // One is tempted to dismiss Brooks 's grand generalizations by rattling off the many ways in which he gets it wrong : by pointing out that the top three soybean producers-Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or by listing the many military bases located on the coasts ; or by noting that when it came time to build a NASCAR track in Kansas , the county that won the honor was one of only two in the state that went for Gore . Average per capita income in that same lonely blue county , I might as well add , is $16,000 , which places it well below Kansas and national averages , and far below what would be required for the putting on of elitist or cosmopolitan airs of any kind . // It 's pretty much a waste of time , however , to catalog the contradictions and tautologies and huge , honking errors blowing round in a media flurry like this . The tools being used are the blunt instruments of propaganda , not the precise metrics of sociology . Yet , as with all successful propaganda , the narrative does contain a grain of truth : we all know that there are many aspects of American life that are off the culture industry 's radar ; that vast reaches of the country have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative ; and that there is a small segment of the " cosmopolitan " upper middle class that considers itself socially enlightened , that knows nothing of the fine points of hayseediana , that likes lattes , and that opted for Gore . // But the " two nations " commentators showed no interest in examining the mysterious inversion of American politics in any systematic way . Their aim was simply to bolster the stereotypes using whatever tools were at hand : to cast the Democrats as the party of a wealthy , pampered , arrogant elite that lives as far as it can from real Americans ; and to represent Republicanism as the faith of the hardworking common people of the heartland , an expression of their unpretentious , all-American ways just like country music and NASCAR . At this pursuit they largely succeeded . By 2003 the conservative claim to the Midwest was so uncontested that Fox News launched a talk show dealing in culture-war outrage that was called , simply , Heartland . // What characterizes the good people of Red America ? Reading through the " two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Frank Capra one-reelers explaining the principles of some turbocharged Boy Scout Law : // A red-stater is humble . In fact , humility is , according to reigning journalistic myth , the signature quality of Red America , just as it was one of the central themes of George W. Bush 's presidential campaign . " In Red America the self is small , " teaches David Brooks . " People declare in a million ways , ' I am normal . ' " As evidence of this modesty , Brooks refers to the plain clothing that he saw residents wearing in a county in Pennsylvania that voted for Bush , and in particular to the unremarkable brand names he spotted on the locals ' caps . The caps clearly indicate that the people of Red America enjoy trusting and untroubled relationships with Wal-Mart and McDonald 's ; ipso facto they are humble . // John Podhoretz , a former speechwriter for Bush the Elder , finds the same noble simplicity beneath every adjusto-cap . " Bush Red is a simpler place , " he concludes , after watching people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " where people mourn the death of NASCAR champion Dale Earnhardt , root lustily for their teams , go to church , and find comfort in old-fashioned verities. " // When the red-starers themselves get into the act , composing lists of their own virtues , things get bad fast . How " humble " can you be when you 're writing a three-thousand-word essay claiming that all the known virtues of democracy are sitting right there with you at the word processor ? This problem comes into blinding focus in a much-reprinted red-state blast by the Missouri farmer Blake Hurst that was originally published in The American Enterprise magazine . He and his fellow Bush voters , Hurst stepped forward to tell the world , were humble , humble , humble , humble ! // Most Red Americans ca n't deconstruct post-modern literature , give proper orders to a nanny , pick out a cabernet with aftertones of licorice , or quote prices from the Abercrombie and Fitch catalog . //                    @
