Section : AT WAR The failure of Middle Eastern studies <p> American intervention in the Middle East will cause " massive unrest throughout the Arab world . " The international coalition built to support it wo n't hold , because the U.S. declines to condemn Israel-and Muslim countries ca n't " withstand this sort of double standard . " The actual war wo n't go well , either : " It wo n't be easy to force them out without resorting to bloody hand-to-hand combat . It 's my guess that they 'll fight and fight hard , even if you bomb them with B-52s . " <p> These dire warnings ought to give President Bush pause , as they come not from ordinary scholars of the Middle East but from men who would seem to be scholars among scholars : the current president of the Middle East Studies Association ( R. Stephen Humphreys of the University of California at Santa Barbara ) and a former one ( Rashid Khalidi of the University of Chicago ) . Yet they were talking to a different President Bush , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were , as it happens , wrong on each count : There was no anti-American revolution throughout the Arab world , the coalition against Saddam Hussein stood strong , and Iraqi soldiers presented little resistance to Operation Desert Storm . <p> Much has been made in recent weeks of the CIA 's failure to penetrate Osama bin Laden 's terrorist cells and prevent thousands of deaths-a failure in what the spooks call " human intelligence . " Left almost untouched in the recriminations following September 11 , however , is another kind of human-intelligence disaster , which has occurred at American universities . Despite receiving millions of dollars in federal grants over several decades to develop an expertise on Islam and Arab culture , the academy has done little but offer spectacular misreadings and terrible advice . Higher education has seen plenty go wrong over the last generation , but the inability-and often the refusal-of professors in Middle Eastern studies to prepare the country for mass terrorism or help it cope with the aftermath may eventually be considered one of its most damaging failures . <p> When the field of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950s , it was part of a broader movement known as " area studies . " There was a consensus that Americans did n't know enough about parts of the world they would increasingly have to engage during the Cold War , such as the Soviet Union , East Asia , and Latin America . The Middle East initially did n't receive as much attention , but it , too , developed as an academic field and took on greater importance over time . <p> Scholars in the U.S. had not neglected the Middle East-the American Oriental Society was founded in 1842-but their interests lay primarily in antiquity . In 1949 , the Committee on Near Eastern Studies observed that " at no university does there appear to be a person who would claim to be an expert in the economics , sociology , or politics of the present-day Near East . " Middle Eastern studies promised to change this by approaching the region with the hardheaded methodologies of social science . Above all , it promised to be relevant . Private foundations were crucial supporters in these early years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the endeavor . In 1958 , Middle Eastern studies started to win financial aid through the National Defense Education Act , a funding mechanism that continues to this day . In 1962 , the government devoted foreign-currency surpluses to the purchase of Arabic books-massive numbers of which were then donated to research libraries . Because of the government 's enormous investment , today there are about 125 centers and programs devoted to Middle Eastern studies , located at colleges and universities across the country . They have awarded thousands of bachelor 's , master 's , and doctoral degrees . The Middle East Studies Association ( MESA ) , the leading professional organization of Mideast specialists , boasts a current membership of more than 2,600 . <p> As part of its quest for relevance , Middle Eastern studies came to think that it should not merely understand current realities but also advocate positive changes . Scholars became reformers ; professors believed they could help nudge the Arab world toward modernization . These motives seemed innocent-even beneficial-but they complicated the scholars ' supposed mission , because interpretation and activism are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that , like area studies generally , it is not moored in traditional academic disciplines . " Area studies are profoundly touched by what 's immediate , " says Philip Siegelman , a China specialist retired from San Francisco State University . " They 're under the constant threat of losing their objectivity and distance . " Area studies-along with women 's studies , black studies , and the like-are responses to dramatic events and social movements . They typically attract students and teachers with passionate political commitments that wind up impeding objective research . Other disciplines are hardly immune to these corruptions , but area studies and their kin are especially vulnerable . Although several sub-fields of Middle Eastern studies have flourished-there is much outstanding scholarship in early history , legal history , and art and architecture-these subjects are far removed from contemporary strategic concerns . It is no coincidence that some of today 's truly great interpreters of the Middle East , such as Bernard Lewis of Princeton and Fouad Ajami of Johns Hopkins , have not emerged from institutions associated with Middle Eastern studies . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the region 's future and its supposedly inevitable embrace of modernity . The field then experienced a series of demoralizing blows , starting with the 1967 Arab-Israeli War and continuing through the 1970s with the Lebanese civil war and the Iranian revolution . Edward Said 's seminal book , Orientalism ( 1978 ) , made matters worse by indicting virtually all previous Western scholarship on the region as ill conceived and racist . These disruptions came at a time when the Left was beginning its long march through the faculty lounges . As Martin Kramer reports in Ivory Towers on Sand , a comprehensive new monograph published by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , " Middle Eastern studies came under a take-no-prisoners assault , which rejected the idea of objective standards , disguised the vice of politicization with the virtue of commitment , and replaced proficiency with ideology . " Scholarly standards suffered so much that perhaps the most fundamental problem with Middle Eastern studies today is that many of the so-called experts associated with it ca n't communicate in Arabic . " How are you supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language ? " asks one eminent historian of the Middle East . <p> Despite these problems , MESA continued to insist on the relevance of the field . In 1979 , it called Middle Eastern studies " one of this country 's greatest resources for understanding and learning to live with an ever more vital part of the world . " Yet it was about to embark upon its most breathtaking failure , something so wrongheaded that it bordered on the delusional-and left the U.S. woefully unprepared for September 11 . <p> Throughout the 1980s and 1990s , Middle Eastern studies professors consistently downplayed the threat posed by Islamic radicalism . Many of them suggested that Islamic movements were in fact engines of democracy and reform . John Esposito of Georgetown University , a leading light in Middle Eastern studies , predicted that the Islamic violence of the 1980s would wane ; in 1992 , he wrote that " the Nineties will prove to be a decade of new alliances and alignments in which the Islamic movements will challenge rather than threaten their societies and the West . " In congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the eve of becoming MESA president , defended the Islamic government of Sudan ( currently one of seven states on the State Department 's list of terrorism sponsors ) : " It is not possible , even using exclusively Western political experience as a basis for definition , to state that if a system does not have two parties , it is not democratic . " In order to appreciate this emerging reality , wrote Esposito and Voll together in 1994 , Americans would " have to transcend their narrow , ethnocentric conceptualization of democracy . " Anybody who disagreed with these rosy assessments was treated with suspicion . As Nobel laureate V. S. Naipaul recently told the New York Times , " That is the trouble with writing about Muslim people . There are people of the universities who want to run you out of town , and they 're paid to . " <p> A related pastime among the Middle Eastern studies set involved the search for a " Martin Luther " of the Islamic world-a figure who would spark a liberal religious reformation . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advancing one candidate after another for this role , only to have their hopes dashed when their favorites proved to be anti-Semites or intellectual lightweights . Their wishful efforts would seem comic if they had not had the side effect of distracting scholars from more vital tasks . Writes Kramer : " The academics were so preoccupied with ' Muslim Martin Luthers ' that they never got around to producing a single serious analysis of bin Laden and his indictment of America . " The closest thing to it , perhaps , is a 1998 Foreign Affairs article by Bernard Lewis ; the best book-length treatment is probably Bin Laden : The Man Who Declared War on America , by congressional staffer Yossef Bodansky , published two years ago . The Taliban also has escaped the critical attention of Middle Eastern studies ; the best book on it is by Ahmed Rashid , a Pakistani journalist . <p> Despite all the happy talk about Islamic democratization , terrorists continued to direct incredible levels of violence against the U.S. throughout the 1990s , attacking barracks in Khobar , embassies in Africa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies was so unwilling to confront this grim reality that shortly after terrorists first tried to topple the towers , in 1993 , Columbia University 's Richard Bulliet responded by organizing a conference not to explain what had happened or why , but to address anti-Muslim prejudice . " Some Muslims from New York are going to be tried for seditious conspiracy to commit criminal acts , " he noted . " A guilty verdict will send a chill of fear throughout America . " Never mind the chill of fear that the terrorists themselves sent through their murder of six people , and attempted murder of thousands of others ; it was a chill that perhaps did not make us shiver enough . Earlier this year , Sarah Lawrence College professor Fawaz A. Gerges added to the chorus by saying Americans were not sufficiently complacent about terrorism : " To what extent do terrorist ' experts ' indirectly perpetuate this irrational fear of terrorism by focusing too much on farfetched horrible scenarios ? Does the terrorist industry , consciously or unconsciously , exaggerate the nature and degree of the terrorist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerges speaks of " the terrorist industry , " he is n't referring to bin Laden 's al-Qaeda network . ) <p> The anti-American sentiment runs so deep that it 's not too much to ask whose side some of these scholars are on . Anne Joyce , the editor of Middle East Policy , once wrote that Jewish violence directed against Palestinians is the product of America 's racist culture , " in which young Jews learned to fear and resent their inner-city neighbors . They went to the Israeli ( wild ) West Bank , where they could tote machine guns and harass at will . " Many scholars have even celebrated hostile regimes . At a 1988 conference in Tehran , Hamid Algar of the University of California at Berkeley praised Iran 's " proud record of resistance to aggression . " The Khomeini government , said Columbia 's Bulliet , threatened the West " not so much because of its own characteristics but because of European intolerance for any fundamentally different ideology . " Harvard professor Nur O. Yalman , writing in the Harvard Crimson on September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blood revenge " and explained , " There had been too much murder going on in Israel and the West Bank for no extreme reprisals to take place . " Similar comments had prompted Norvell B. De Atkine and Daniel Pipes to write in Academic Questions five years ago that MESA had transformed itself from " an American organization interested in the Middle East to a Middle Eastern one that happens to meet in the United States . " <p> Despite all this , Middle Eastern studies professors continue to believe they have much to offer-but not to the government . Even though Congress is a leading patron of Middle Eastern studies , many scholars wo n't advise policymakers . When an academic research program run by the Pentagon solicited papers from federally supported Middle East studies centers to " supplement analyses and policy deliberations with the Department of Defense " in 1983 , the professors would have nothing to do with it . MESA 's ethics committee tried to discredit the program and dissuade members from participating . The organization eventually urged " university-based international studies programs to refrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked its members " to reflect carefully upon their responsibilities to the academic profession prior to seeking or accepting funding . " ( At the same time , MESA seemed to have no problem with programs that took money from Arab governments . ) <p> There have even been attempts to cultivate irrelevance . In 1985 , Georgetown University 's Judith Tucker surveyed scholarship in Middle Eastern studies and was glad to report it displayed " less of the imprint of stringent policy demands " than it had in the past . She only regretted it was " not entirely free of the test of relevance to policy concerns . " This appears not to have changed , judging from the program for MESA 's upcoming annual convention on November 17-20 in San Francisco . There are plenty of panels on trendy feminist topics-titles include " Empowering Muslim Women " and " Gender and Sexual Identity in Modern Arabic Literature " - but nothing on terrorism or the Taliban except a hastily organized " special session " that will discuss September 11 for two hours . MESA 's formal statement on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " presumably because this is a loaded term in its circles . Instead , it speaks of " condolences to all those personally affected by the tragedy " - as if this were something less than a national catastrophe . <p> " Middle Eastern studies probably should have taken terrorism more seriously , " admits MESA president R. Stephen Humphreys . But he 's still defensive : " Our field was blindsided by September 11 , but so was the FBI , CIA , and everybody else who 's supposed to know about this stuff . " Of course , the FBI and CIA , whatever their lapses , have prevented an unknowable number of terrorist acts against Americans . And as far as the policy community goes , there really were a few Cassandras in our midst-experts who warned us about the consequences of ignoring terrorism but who were themselves ignored . They just did n't hail from the academic field of Middle Eastern studies , which , when it chooses to help at all , seems to provide nothing but bad advice . Unfortunately , there 's no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " There is no professional cost for substantive error in interpreting the actual Middle East . Indeed , leaders of the field do it all the time without any negative consequences . " <p> They may even try to take advantage of the current crisis , exploiting it as a Sputnik-like catalyst for increased public funding of Middle Eastern studies . It would be a big mistake to let them do this : The U.S. clearly needs to improve its understanding of the Middle East , starting with the basic chore of bringing on more national-security personnel who can speak Arabic . We can accomplish this most readily by improving education in the traditional disciplines . <p> It wo n't be long before the professors gripe that they deserve more attention ; they 're frankly envious of the think-tank specialists who have come to replace them as advisers to the government . Not long after the Gulf War , MESA 's then-president Rashid Khalidi-who had predicted a disaster for the U.S. in the region-sent a letter to members complaining that " the consensus of experts in the Middle East field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in framing their policies . " <p> Praise be for that . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By John J. Miller <p>
