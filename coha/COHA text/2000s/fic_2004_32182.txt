Chapter One Flaming in the western sky were the banners of a salmon and gold sunset . Birds sang themselves to sleep in the hedgerows ; shadows flowed like water across the hills of Clare . As the gray stallion galloped up the lane toward home , a startled blackbird exploded from a gorse bush . The horse shied violently but the girl on his back merely laughed . " Heart of a lion , you , " said Ursula Halloran . Reining the stallion to a halt , she stroked his neck . He pawed the ground and snorted with belated courage . " Easy , Saoirse , stand easy now . " Until he was obedient to her will she would not allow him to move forward . Caught in a bubble of time , they waited . When she was a toddler in the Dublin tenement district , Ursula had been known as Precious . Applied to a scrawny waif with huge blue eyes staring out of a pinched little face , the name was ironic . Irish slum children were far from precious in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Clarecastle-had wrought a transformation in the girl . The pale hair of infancy had given way to a heavy mane the color of oak leaves in autumn . Healthy freckles were spattered across glowing cheeks ; puberty had brought a hint of gray to her eyes . Her smile revealed excellent teeth , a rarity among the Irish . Early malnutrition had left its mark , however . She would always be too slender . The angular planes of her face did not conform to the current fashion for feminine beauty , though in old age they would be magnificent . They might have been carved from the stones of ancient Ireland . In her imagination Ursula never pictured herself as a mythic warrior queen . Her models were living patriots : Maud Gonne , the passionate revolutionary who had inspired W. B. Yeats and personified Caitln N Houlihan , the eponymous spirit of Ireland , in his most famous play . Or Constance Markievicz , the fearless rebel countess who had turned her back on rank and privilege to fight beside the men in the Rising of 1916 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty of those famous women meant nothing to her . It was their inner fire she sought to emulate . When country lads followed Ursula with their eyes she thought they were seeing her as she saw herself . Heroic in her heart . The blazingly yellow blossoms of the gorse smelt like coconut . Atop a hillock in the adjacent field stood a solitary thorn tree ; one of the fairy trees enchanted when Ireland was young . The white lace mantle that was its springtime glory had almost gone . When a breeze set the last few petals adrift , bereft branches clawed the sky with empty fingers . Ursula felt an inexplicable connection to Ireland 's ancient magic , as if time were a curve without beginning or end and some remnant of druidry slumbered in her blood . But there is a new magic now , she thought . Invisible waves of power are racing through the air . Uncle Henry says they will change the world . His letter in her pocket was like an unexploded bomb . She slipped one hand into her woolly jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been torn open . Taking out the letter , she strained to reread Henry Mooney 's typewritten words in the fading light . 20 May 1925 Dear Ursula , I hope this finds you well . Ella and I are in good form , considering everything , and our little Isabella is a blessing in these troubled times . For such a wee mite she certainly has a mind of her own . She reminds me of you in that respect . You must come up to Dublin to see her . Soon . The deliberate emphasis was disturbing . Newspapermen like Henry never underlined words . His letters to Ursula invariably included commentary on political events , an interest they shared . This time he wrote sourly : " The partition of Ireland is a disaster , even worse than the Act of Union that forcibly joined this country with Britain . Partition stranded thousands of supporters of the Union within the Irish Free State . But that was the price the Unionist Party was willing to pay to cut off a portion of the north from the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call ' a Protestant state for a Protestant people . ' " As you know , Protestants in the south are not discriminated against . Sadly the same is not true for the Catholics who now find themselves stranded in the north . The government of the Free State-most of them Catholics themselves-has abandoned these unfortunate people to their fate . Mobs describing themselves as ' loyalist ' - meaning loyal to the king of England , I suppose-are attacking them with impunity . " Have you heard of the B-Special militia in Northern Ireland ? It is composed of Protestants who belong almost without exception to the Orange Order . The B-Specials have undertaken to solve the problem of sectarian violence in the north by the simple expedient of eliminating the Catholics . According to the latest figures I 've seen , over six hundred have been killed in the last couple of years . Ten thousand have lost their jobs and twice that number have lost their homes . " In the dictionary I once gave you is the word pogrom . Look it up . You will find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia . It now describes what is happening to Catholics in the north . When we began the struggle to free this island from foreign domination , who could have foreseen it would turn out this way ? " Henry 's letter concluded , " Next month I shall be off to London for a few days . I hope to sell a feature article on the British Broadcasting Company , which is about to liquidate as a private corporation and go public . I have mixed feelings about broadcasting . As a print journalist I am committed to the written word , yet I predict that one day all communications will be carried on radio waves . Wireless transmission will change the world , Little Business . " Ursula smiled at Henry 's use of the old pet name . No one else ever called her Little Business . On the back of the letter was a postscript in his wife 's graceful handwriting . " You really must come soon . We have something to discuss which can not be put into a letter . Henry wanted to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not allow it . I was afraid for him . You understand . " I do understand , Ella , Ursula thought sadly as she tucked the letter back into its envelope . There would be trouble if Uncle Henry came to the farm . The Irish Civil War , which some called the War of Brothers , was only two years in the past . The wounds to the Irish soul were still bleeding . Gathering the reins and clucking to her mount , Ursula sent him forward at a trot . A gentle blue twilight soon enfolded them . When they reached the long lane off the Ennis road Saoirse pricked his ears and broke into a headlong gallop , eager for his bucket of oats . The stallion was kept in the barn at night . By the time Ursula unsaddled him , rubbed him down and fed him , the pungent smell of lamb stew was drifting across the walled farmyard between the kitchen at the back of the house and the barn . Ursula gave her horse a parting caress , rubbing her cheek against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusement for teenage youngsters in rural Ireland . But Ursula Halloran had a horse . Saoirse raised his head from his oat bucket long enough to nicker after her as she closed the barn door . With boyishly long strides , Ursula crossed the farmyard to the house . Her own stomach was rumbling with hunger . Yet she paused for a moment before going in . Framed by the open top of the half door was a familiar picture . At a large kitchen table covered with an oilcloth sat a lanky , dark-haired man , sipping a glass of poitn . An old woman as plump and soft as a buttered scone was cooking a meal on the black iron range set in the mouth of the cavernous fireplace . Every evening Ned Halloran and his Aunt Norah repeated this scene . Every , every evening . As predictable as the tick of the clock on the wall . Radio waves can travel to faraway places , Ursula thought as she gazed into the kitchen , places where people live different lives . Exciting lives . Things happening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the room , Ned Halloran and his aunt looked up in anticipation . Ursula could light a room with the candlepower of her smile . Tonight , however , she merely gave a preoccupied nod . " I 'm back , Papa . " " What 's wrong ? " Norah Daly asked sharply . " Nothing 's wrong . " " Did ye call at the post office ? " " I did of course . There was a letter from Kathleen in America . " Ursula dug into her pocket and produced the two envelopes , dropping the unopened one onto the table . " What 's that other one ? " Ned Halloran wanted to know . " Just a note for me , Papa . " She stuffed it back into her pocket . The look he gave her was a dagger of green glass . " From where ? " " Dublin . " " Dublin . " He spat out the word . " Do n't be starting on the girl , " the old woman admonished . " All I said was Dublin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it . I 'll have no rows in here . " Ned 's cleft chin jutted at a dangerous angle . " I 'll fight where I like . " The old woman left her cooking for a moment to pour an additional inch of poitn , colorless as water and potent as fire , into his glass . " Wrap yourself around this now and do n't be making trouble . " She returned to the range and thrust a long-handled spoon into the pot . A critical sip , a shake of the head . " There 's no flavor to this lamb at all . Frank butchered it too young , so he did . Chop another onion or two , " she said to Ursula , " and would you ever make some dumplings ? " Ursula hated cooking . " Ca n't Lucy and Eileen make the dumplings ? " she asked hopefully . Ned Halloran 's sisters liked to cook . Or so they claimed . Norah Daly pushed a lock of gray hair back from her forehead with one liver-spotted wrist . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucy 's gone down the fields to fetch Frank for his tea . He 'd not eat otherwise . The poor crayture works all the hours God sends . Unlike some not a hundred miles from here , " she added , shooting a narrow glance at Ned , " who waste their time drilling with the Mid-Clare Brigade . " " I think Papa 's very brave to remain active in the Irish Republican Army under the circumstances , " Ursula said . " It 's almost as bad as it was after the 1916 Rising , except now it 's other Irish men , instead of the British , who 're jailing our patriots . What Papa 's doing is more important than milking cows and planting cabbage . He 's fighting for the Republic that was stolen from us . " Norah retorted , " Do n't be preaching Republicanism to me , girleen . Did I not join Cumann na mBan meself ? But that was then and this is now . Do ye not read the newspapers ? They 're beginning to print Republican with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower case does n't mean a thing . " " Our side lost the war , Ursula ! " Norah cried in exasperation . " The IRA Volunteers were ordered to bury their weapons ! The Free State government is perfectly within its rights to arrest those who wo n't accept its authority . I agree with your Uncle Frank . He says we should be planting crops that fill the belly instead of filling the churchyard . " Ned Halloran picked up his glass and the letter from America and strode from the kitchen . The stairs creaked . A door slammed overhead . A furious fist thudded against a wall . Again and again and again . There was no more political talk in the kitchen . Ursula took a sulphur match from the box beside the range , and , clenching the matchstick between her teeth to keep her eyes from tearing , she began chopping onions . After a time Norah said , " What was in Henry 's letter ? " Ursula removed the match . " Only the usual Dublin goster . He sent you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face pleated into a smile . " He 's not the worst in the world , is Henry . He 's almost as dear to me as my poor dead sister 's children , may God a ' mercy on her . It 's a terrible thing entirely , this quarrel between Henry and your father . " " Half the families in Ireland are n't speaking to one another , " said Ursula . " The Civil War 's too recent . " " You think that 's the trouble ? " " What else could it be ? " Norah did not answer . Difficult questions were best ignored . There was a scraping of feet outside . Frank , the oldest Halloran , balding and bony , clomped into the kitchen . " Stones in the high field wanted clearing , " he said . Thanks to a new set of badly fitted false teeth , he spoke with a whistle . He hung his cap on its customary nail and dropped wearily onto a chair . The farm was killing him . Wearing him down , demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to help with the work they never stayed very long . In the end Frank felt it was all up to himself . His father had sown and planted according to the stars in the sky and the phases of the moon . In those days the farm had flourished . On the death of his parents , the land had come to Frank as the oldest son . He dismissed his father 's theories as " pagan airy-fairy " and would have nothing to do with them . Month by month and year by year , the place was slowly failing and he did not know why . In his secret heart Frank hated the farm . His sister Lucy followed him into the room . A sober , stolid child , she had grown into a sober , stolid woman , with thick eyebrows and a graceless body . Lucy was the second of three Halloran daughters . Kathleen , the family beauty , had married a prosperous American and was living in New York . Eileen , the last born , was a dimpled flirt who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men took Lucy walking out . People said of her , " She wo n't have a man on foot and the men on horses pass her by . " Few options were open to rural spinsters . If she did not emigrate Lucy could either become a shop assistant in town , or serve as unpaid labor on the family farm . Lucy disliked farm life , but she had no taste for shopkeeping either and lacked the desperation to emigrate . If-as seemed increasingly likely-Frank remained a bachelor , and the widowed Ned did not marry again , upon their deaths the farm would pass to Lucy . By that time she would be long past childbearing . Ironically , she would have plenty of suitors then-feckless men looking for a woman of property to support them . Of all those in the Halloran household , only Ursula truly loved the land . She was the one who walked the fields in every season , examining the condition of soil and crops , checking on walls and fences , pausing often just to look . To gaze out across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry . Yet for reasons everyone understood and no one talked about , the farm would never be hers . " There 's a letter from America , " Norah said while Lucy poured a cup of strong tea for Frank . Continues ...
