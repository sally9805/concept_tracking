It 's a good thing MARTHA STEWART knows how to fill the hours with domestic projects . The lifestyle mogul has agreed to extend her court-imposed home confinement three weeks , until Aug. 31 , after reports that she violated the terms of her house arrest . Stewart may have irked authorities by unrolling her mat at a nearby hatha yoga class and tooling around her suburban New York estate on a Kawasaki Mule four-wheel-drive vehicle . Imprisoned for lying about a stock trade , Stewart will still be freed in time for the fall debuts of her new TV programs , the syndicated daily talk show Martha and NBC 's The Apprentice . In the meantime , she can practice her downward dogs at home until they 're criminally good .
