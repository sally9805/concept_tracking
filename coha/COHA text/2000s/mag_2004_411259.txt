. Although hunting seasons are winding down in many states , casing your guns for the winter is only one option . Some hunters go to Texas , where the snows have wings . Others hunt the rut all over again in Alabama . Still others grab the dogs and head to California to hunt quail . Here are details on these and four other places where the hunting is great , even late . 1 Texas Snow Geese Visit the " goose hunting capital of the world " in Eagle Lake , Texas  --  or any number of nearby townships that could just as legitimately make that claim . Since an agricultural boom in the late 1960s , the entire Texas coastal prairie , which extends south , east , and west of Houston , has become the nation 's premier light goose destination . The stories of snow goose flocks so big they obliterate the sun and so loud they drown out your thoughts are just about true . By December and January , the majority of the geese that will winter on the coastal prairie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Set up near a major roost and you might see tens of thousands of geese in a day . To hunt them , though , you 'll likely have to open your wallet . Virtually the entire area is privately owned , with access to the best properties controlled by guides and outfitters . Guided hunts run $100 to $150 per person per day . But if you choose your outfitter carefully , via research and recommendations , you 'll enjoy some of the best waterfowling on the continent . A great resource is www.hotspotguides.com , which features a list of nearly 200 Texas outfitters . HOTSPOTS : For the best action , Dave Morrison , waterfowl program leader with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department , points to the Katy Prairie near the towns of El Campo and Wharton , as well as the Eagle Lake Prairie near the town of Eagle Lake . Excellent hunting can also be had farther east on the Anahuac Prairie along Interstate 10 . Among the few public areas that offer good late-season action , according to Morrison , are Mad Island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of which are situated along the coast ( check local regulations ) . INSIDER TIP : " During the late season , put the shooters 50 or so yards downwind of the spread while the callers hang back , " says guide Al Glos of Texas Waterfowl Outfitters ( 800-899-2650 ; www.texaswaterfowl.com ) . " This way , shooters intercept incoming geese before they have a chance to flare . The result is plenty of passing shots at 30 to 40 yards . " SEASON DATES : South Zone light goose , Oct. 25  --  Jan. 18 ; Coastal Prairie Light Goose Conservation Order , Jan. 19  --  Mar. 28. 2 Arizona Coues ' Deer Arizona 's wild desert mountains are home to Coues ' deer , the small whitetail subspecies that Jack O'Connor so admired . The best hunting takes place during the late-December and January rut . For a world-class challenge , bring a bow . While most rifle hunters have to enter a lottery for their tags , bowhunters can buy theirs over the counter . Southeastern Arizona holds more Coues ' deer than any area north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminutive and shy grayish whitetail among a panorama of grayish parched hills and canyons presents a fabulous , if formidable , challenge . The rut , at least , evens the playing field some . " Hunter success is much better during the late season , " says Brian Wakeling , big-game manager with the Arizona Game and Fish Department . " The deer cover much more ground during the rut , which improves your odds of glassing them enormously . Look for whitetails where the grasslands meet the scrub oaks , and on slopes rather than the desert floor . The bulk of the deer will be between 3,000 and 6,000 feet . " HOTSPOTS : For the best all-around public Coues ' deer hunting in Arizona , target Game Management Units 36A and especially 36B and 36C south of Tucson . " Two years ago , the hunter success rate during the late rifle season in 36C was 64 percent , " Wakeling notes . " If your primary goal is a trophy-class buck , however , try Unit 6A south of Flagstaff . " The vast majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but excellent private-land hunting is available on the 1.8-million-acre San Carlos Apache Reservation ( 928-475-2343 ) , where a limited number of rifle tags are available over the counter . ( Access fees run from $700 to $3,000 depending on unit and date . ) INSIDER TIP : " Glass with tripod-mounted binoculars , " says Pat Feldt of Arizona Guided Hunts ( 520-207-7831 ; www.arizonahunting.net ) . " Set up where you can see at least a square mile , and bring powerful optics . We use 15x56 binoculars and a 45X spotting scope . Bow-hunters , who will find it very difficult to stalk within range , should stalk instead to within a couple hundred yards , then rattle and grunt to close the distance . " SEASON DATES : Late rifle , Dec. 12-Dec. 31 ; late archery , Dec. 12  --  Jan. 31 in most areas . 3 Louisiana Ducks Some 4.7 million ducks winter annually where the Mississippi meets the Gulf , the nation 's largest coastal tidal marsh . It 's no wonder that Louisiana waterfowlers consistently bag nearly twice as many ducks as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous duck hunting , follow the Big Muddy . Upriver , winter rains push waters beyond their banks , creating fabulous hunting for greenheads and other puddle ducks in potholes , flooded timber , and soaked agricultural fields . Downriver , 600,000 acres of ricefields border 3.5 million acres of fertile coastal marsh , drawing a tremendous number and variety of wintering ducks , including mallards , pintails , teal , gadwall , wigeon , and mottled ducks . HOTSPOTS : For the best mallard hunting , target the backwaters of the Mississippi and its tributaries , notably the Boeuf , Ouachita , and Red Rivers , in northeastern and central Louisiana . " The Chafalaya River is another tremendous freshwater system , " says Robert Helm , waterfowl program manager with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries . " Good public areas here include the Ouachita and Russell Sage Wildlife Management Areas in the northeast , Boeuf WMA just south of there , and Catahoula Lake in central Louisiana . " The ricefields and coastal marshes in the south are mostly private , and you can find excellent guided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lacassine National Wildlife Refuges in the southwest are large public areas that provide great late-season action along the coast . INSIDER TIP : " Muddy up the water , " says waterfowl guide Larry Shuff of Louisiana Hunting Adventures ( 337-526-2961 ; **34;876;TOOLONG ) . " Walk through the water to make it look like there 's been a lot of waterfowl activity around your spread . Also , mix up your decoy placement from hunt to hunt , and do less high-balling on the call . " SEASON DATES : Late duck : West Zone , Dec. 13  --  Jan. 18 ; East Zone , Dec. 13  --  Jan. 25. 4 Alabama Whitetails Peak breeding is long over in most states , but among Alabama 's 1.75 million whitetails , the New Year rings in the rut . That an Alabama hunter can legally take nearly 200 deer per season is testament to the state 's dense whitetail population . " There are few good reasons why a reasonably skilled hunter should n't be able to take a deer in Alabama , " says Chris Cook , wildlife biologist with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says , " there 's a big advantage to hunting the late season . Even when mast and weather conditions are not ideal , you know the deer will be moving during the rut . If you 're willing to poke around the woods a bit , you 'll find bucks . " HOTSPOTS : Freelance hunters have a great shot at trophy bucks on public lands managed for quality deer . You can target Lowndes Wildlife Management Area in central Alabama ; Freedom Hills and Lauderdale WMAs in the northwest ; and especially Barbour and Covington WMAs in the southeast , both of which have been in the state 's Quality Deer Management program for five years . The renowned Black Belt region in central and southern Alabama is largely private , yet offers the best combination of quantity and quality  --  and plenty of guides and outfitters to accommodate you . Top counties include Pickens , Greene , Marengo , Hale , Dallas , Perry , Macon , Bullock , and Montgomery . But the state 's biggest racks , Cook says , are currently coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lamar Counties . INSIDER TIP : " During the rut , bucks are really up and moving , " says guide Bojie Beers of the Alabama River Lodge ( 334-874-4281 ; www.alariver.com ) . " So set up where you can see a long way , whether you 're overlooking a big field or open hardwoods . You 'll see more deer , and you 'll have more time to judge the animal and get your shot off . Just as important , sit for as long as you can stand it  --  preferably all day . " SEASON DATES : Firearm , Nov. 22  --  Jan. 31 ; archery , Oct. 15  --  Jan. 31 ; muzzleloader , Nov. 19  --  21 and Jan. 9  --  25. 5 California Quail Any part of Southern California is a fine place to be in December and January , but we recommend the Mojave Desert region , where you can bag California , mountain , and Gambel 's quail , and chukar partridge  --  all in the same trip on more than 7 million acres of public land . Good rainfall this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the east and west Mojave Desert regions , according to Andy Pauli , wildlife biologist with the California Department of Fish and Game . " I counted more than 400 quail in two days at a water hole this spring . So the birds are here . " And the bird hunters should have their best season in years . HOTSPOTS : Look for California quail along the Mojave River valley near Victorville and in the Granite Mountains , north of State Highway 18 . For mountain quail , work the BLM lands south of Lucerne Valley , as well as the northern edge of the San Bernardino National Forest . And for chukars , try around Ord Mountain and Goat Spring near State Highway 247 , as well as the Lucerne Valley , Barstow , and Apple Valley areas . Finally , you can find good hunting for Gambel 's quail along the eastern slope of the San Bernardino National Forest near Yucca Valley . But they are most abundant and evenly distributed in the eastern part of Mojave . Try the area near the Hole-in-the-Wall Campground and Soshea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles east of Barstow . INSIDER TIP : " Concentrate on water sources for quail , " Pauli says . " Use a quail call to locate birds , or just park your vehicle and listen for them calling , especially in mornings and evenings . For chukars , focus on slopes with cheatgrass and filaree , and be willing to expend some boot leather . " SEASON DATES : For both quail and chukar , Oct. 18  --  Jan. 25. 6 Kansas Pheasants and Bobwhites There are states with more pheasants and states with more bob-white quail . But if you want great hunting for both through the end of January , head for Kansas . According to Bob Matthews , chief of information and education at the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks , many of the state 's most avid upland hunters wait for the late season , when fewer hunters vie for birds concentrated in prime cover . " On a good day , you 'll put up 12 to 20 coveys of quail , and each hunter might get eight to 10 makeable shots at roosters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upland action is available to anyone , as both resident and nonresident hunters have access to nearly 1 million acres of private land through the state 's Walk-In Hunting Areas program . HOTSPOTS : Central and south-central Kansas perennially offer the best wingshooting . It 's consistently good throughout the region , Matthews says , but nonresident hunters should choose counties that combine prime hunting with a good selection of walk-in areas , such as Pawnee , Barton , Rush , and Edwards . For pheasants , hunt CRP grasses early and late in the day , and focus on pockets of cover in or near feeding fields during midday . For bob-whites , work thicker woody cover , such as shelterbelts , plum thickets , or pasture lands . INSIDER TIP : " Take advantage of any breaks in the weather , " Matthews says . " If the sun pops out at midday , skip lunch because the birds will be out feeding . Weather is the biggest variable in December and January ; if you have the opportunity to check the forecast before you come , do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for both pheasants and quail in the eastern two-thirds of the state . 7 Ohio Canada Geese You do n't have to visit the Sun Belt for great late-season waterfowling . Open water and fertile farmland make central Ohio a magnet for Canada geese . " The Scioto River Valley is a major migration corridor , and we have very good numbers of Canada geese that stick around through the late seasons , " notes Gary Ludwig , a wildlife biologist with the Ohio Division of Wildlife . The bag limit for Canadas is two , but it does n't end there . " When everything but the river freezes , the duck hunting south of Columbus can be as good as anywhere in the country , " says avid waterfowler and ODW biologist Dan Crusey . " In fact , the best mallard hunting does n't really get going until the month of December . " HOTSPOTS : " For as long as there 's open water , the marshes of Killdeer Plains and Big Island Wildlife Areas in Wyandot and Marion Counties offer fabulous public hunting , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creek Lakes north of Columbus and Deer Creek Lake south of Columbus , which often stay open well into the late season . " ( Regulations vary on each , so check the ODW website at www.ohiodnr.com/wildlife before you go . ) " There 's also plenty of opportunity for freelance field hunters , " Ludwig says , " as lots of farmers want the geese killed . " Among the top counties are Wyandot , Marion , Franklin , Delaware , Pickaway , and Ross . INSIDER TIP : The key , according to Crusey , is to know how the weather affects the hunting . Generally , when the marshes freeze , hit the reservoirs . When the reservoirs freeze , hunt the Scioto River and surrounding fields south of Columbus . Be mobile and flexible and you 'll be in business . SEASON DATES : For the South Zone , including most areas mentioned above : duck , Dec. 13  --  Jan. 18 ; Canada goose , Dec. 13  --  Jan. 28 .
