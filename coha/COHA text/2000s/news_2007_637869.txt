<p> Lazarus column aims <p> at wrong company <p> Editor  --  This is in response to David Lazarus ' June 15 column , " No such thing as a free laptop . " Please title it " Do n't confuse us with someone else . " <p> Lazarus ' column is an interesting combination of a contortion of the facts and literary sleight of hand . <p> The IWantMyFreeLaptop.com home page states five times that the consumer will need to complete sponsor offers and program requirements . Given the font size of the program requirements , it is difficult to call it fine print or the length voluminous . <p> The literary slight of hand begins with a pointed comment from Steve Cox of the Better Business Bureau , who we have never heard from . He references " consumers who spent hundreds of dollars and countless hours but never got the goods . " <p> Only one problem  --  Cox did n't mention our company . He ca n't , because to the best of my knowledge , there is not a single person who has met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then from Al Polizzi , also of the BBB , who states , " They 're not coming through with their promises . " This is simply not true . Polizzi should read his own Web site and he would see that virtually all BBB complaints have been resolved . <p> Lazarus cites other " experts and pundits " in very damning and far-sweeping statements , but they do n't mention our company either . Unless you read very closely , the skullduggery is not readily apparent , but it is there . The reason they do n't mention our company is very simple : They ca n't and be truthful about it . <p> There is some history from three years ago , related to startup challenges , but those have been rectified . <p> The article goes on to cite different companies , name changes and mergers , etc. , with an implication that there is something scandalous occurring . This is normal corporate restructuring  --  getting business pieces in the right places under our World Avenue brand name . It is not uncommon for multiple entities to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : TheUseful LLC has fulfilled tens of thousands of gifts and never failed to give a gift to anyone who qualified . It 's the only company in this industry with a U.S. call center to help consumers resolve problems . Fewer than 1 in 10,000 visitors to TheUseful 's web sites complain . Not a bad record . We will continue to fulfill gifts , answer questions , and help resolve consumer complaints as necessary . <p> In conclusion , Lazarus ' article may have some legitimacy for some companies in this industry , but his artfully crafted message is aimed at the wrong company . <p> DALE BAKER , President <p> TheUseful LLC <p> United glitch is n't <p> enough for legislation <p> Editor  --  Your June 21 article about the United Airlines computer glitch and the ensuing delay of hundreds of flights claims that the experience " has fueled enthusiasm for a passenger bill of rights "  --  legislation that would set standards for treatment of passengers in the event of a delay . Such legislation could only hurt us all . <p> A better plan is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circumstances simply to punish United Airlines directly . Avoid traveling on United , and tell all your friends and relatives to do the same . The result would be immediate and heartily felt by the airline , as well as noticed by all other airlines . <p> Seeing that passengers actually get upset , the airlines will implement voluntary plans for unforeseen delays . Their plans would , no doubt , be simpler and more effective than whatever gets legislated . <p> The simple fact is that government " solutions " to " problems " are usually draconian and ineffective . <p> Let 's do ourselves a favor and not ask government to act as the playground monitor , but recognize our own power as economic actors . <p> CAMDEN W. McCONNELL <p> Pittsburg <p> Home loan ' study ' <p> lacks basic info <p> Editor  --  Your July 11 article ( " Study tracks disparity in home loans " ) cites a study by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition that concludes that blacks and Hispanics pay more for home loans than whites . <p> This , says the coalition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discrimination against minorities . " <p> The Mortgage Bankers Association was quick to criticize the report for concentrating on race and for failing to consider other factors " such as borrowers ' debt levels and the amount of money they can provide as a down payment . " <p> When " studies " like this began to appear in the early 1990s , the then-governor of the Federal Reserve Board cautioned that " while its findings might suggest discriminatory practices , the data reviewed did not include information on the applicants ' credit history or other information that play into lending decisions . " A few years later , when similar disparate figures were reported , a representative of the American Bankers Association again pointed out that the report did not " take into account such factors as applicants ' previous indebtedness and credit record . " <p> Here we are again , 15 years later , listening to the same complaint . The only " persistence " in this scenario is the continuous repetition of as yet unsupported claims of racial discrimination . <p> KEVIN J. MULLEN <p> Novato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Arthur M. Louis ' Moneybag column about Proposition 13 ( " Prop . 13 override could raise taxes , " July 15 ) , there is a complaint of one neighbor paying eight times the tax of a similar property in the neighborhood . <p> While that issue gets raised often , what seems to be totally ignored is that when Prop . 13 passed in the late 1970s , business and residential property taxes were split approximately 50-50 ; now that split is about 25-75 , with the greater amount on the backs of residents . <p> What seems important to me is restoring that balance to the property tax equation . One way to do this might be to reassess non-residential properties every 10 years , with the change in taxes phased in over the next 10 years . This avoids any sudden increase , which happened pre-Prop. 13 . <p> It is predictable and , I would claim , fair . I 'm sorry that this aspect of the property tax situation seems to be ignored , not just by politicians , but business writers as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
