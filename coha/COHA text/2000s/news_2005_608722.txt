<p> It pays , more than ever , to be at the top . <p> The median total compensation for the 100 highest-paid executives in The Washington Post 's annual survey of executive pay was $5.25 million in 2004 , up slightly from $5.13 million the year before . <p> Last year , 294 executives of area companies received packages worth $1 million or more , compared with 270 executives in 2003 and 190 in 2000 , according to The Post 's study of top-level compensation at 157 local companies that publicly report pay and benefits . <p> The median total compensation  --  which includes salary and bonus , long-term benefits , perks and the projected value of option grants  --  for all executives in the 2004 survey was $704,713 , compared with $668,049 in 2003 . The median is the midpoint of the survey , with half below and half above . The survey covered 764 executives in 2004 compared with 728 in 2003 . <p> Dale B. Wolf , 50 , president and chief executive of Coventry Health Care Inc. of Bethesda , had the richest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His salary , bonus , perks and stock options put his total compensation at $32.3 million . The biggest portion of Wolf 's pay was stock options , which The Post valued at $30.6 million , assuming an annual stock price increase of 5 percent over the life of the options . <p> Richard D. Fairbank , chief executive of Capitol One Financial Corp . of McLean , was second in total compensation , at $29.5 million . Fairbank received no salary or bonus . Nearly all his compensation package was options . <p> Of the executives who took home the most cash in 2004 , the top four were the senior executives of Friedman , Billings , Ramsey Group Inc. , an investment bank based in Arlington County . At the top of the list for cash , co-chief executives Eric F. Billings and Emanuel J. Friedman each pulled down $10.7 million in 2004 , $9.4 million of that in the form of a cash bonus . Friedman , who was forced to resign this spring from the firm he co-founded , is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at area companies tracked increases in shareholder value . Of the 117 local chief executives in place at least two years on Dec. 31 , the average cash pay increase last year was 17 percent , and the average total return to shareholders was 20 percent . <p> But there were exceptions  --  21 chief executives at companies whose shareholders lost money in 2004 received cash pay increases , and 10 of those received double-digit cash pay increases . <p> Of the 100 highest-compensated executives , 97 were men . The highest-paid woman at a public company in the Washington area was Joan M. Sweeney , chief operating officer of Allied Capital Corp. , a Washington corporate finance company . Sweeney was paid $8.5 million , including $1.5 million in cash and options worth an estimated $5.5 million . <p> Companies with executives at the top of the lists for total compensation or total cash argued that the rewards were earned as pay for performance . <p> At Coventry Health Care , Wolf was promoted from chief financial officer to chief executive in January , one of the career turning points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super-size increase in compensation . <p> The board of the Bethesda health insurer awarded options to Wolf in June on 1 million shares of company stock " as a performance-based stock incentive to retain and incent Mr. Wolf to continue the success of the company and in anticipation of Mr. Wolf 's becoming the chief executive officer , " according to the company 's filing with the SEC . Wolf and other company officials did not return phone calls seeking comment . <p> Wolf and former chief executive Allen F. Wise , who is now chairman , took over a troubled managed health care company in 1995 . Coventry has built its business buying mid-size , often under-performing health plans in a number of states and turning them around , said Joseph D. France , who follows Coventry at Banc of America Securities . <p> " They are by far the best performer in managed care in recent years , " France said . " They are very entrepreneurial . In terms of return that shareholders have enjoyed , their compensation stacks up well . " <p> Coventry 's shareholders have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dec. 31 , according to Bloomberg News . <p> At Capitol One , Fairbank has been compensated almost wholly through options for a number of years , on the grounds that if the stock price declines and shareholders lose money , he wo n't receive a dime . So far , however , this strategy has worked to his benefit . Last year alone , he cashed in options with a net value to him of $56.5 million . All the options he exercised last year were about to expire ; he had held on to them for nearly the life of their terms . A $1,000 investment in the credit card company 's stock 10 years ago would be worth more than $10,000 today . <p> Friedman , Billings , Ramsey has earned more than $550 million in the past two years , and last year it was one of the most profitable investment banks in the nation as measured by return on equity . On Wall Street , that means big bonuses . FBR spokesman Bill Dixon said that bonus pay for senior executives is tied to earnings per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the executives would n't have received any bonuses . FBR 's chief executive salary , $480,000 last year , is substantially below average for most Wall Street firms and less than 126 other executive salaries in this year 's local survey . <p> The 2004 bonus for Friedman was his last . He resigned in April after the SEC began investigating insider trading allegations against him . The company has offered $7.5 million to settle the allegations on its part , but the investigations into Friedman and two other former senior FBR executives are continuing . <p> Friedman 's 2004 pay was granted before the insider trading investigation targeted him . He received no pension or severance payments when he left the company . <p> Michael D. Capellas , chief executive of MCI Inc. , was paid $25.2 million last year , most of it as a reward for pulling the Ashburn-based telecommunications company out of bankruptcy . He received a $5 million bonus and $18 million worth of restricted stock . <p> Restricted stock is given to an executive but can be sold only after a number of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corp . in McLean , which sells aircraft parts and sports and leisure apparel , has long been among the highest paid of local executives . He had the highest salary in the Washington area in 2004 , $2.5 million , but did n't receive a bonus . As a result , his total cash payment was down significantly from $7.8 million in 2003 . <p> Putting some of the survey numbers in perspective : <p> * The local companies in the 2004 survey collectively paid their 764 top executives more than $500 million in cash , perks worth $67 million , and $188 million in restricted stock and other long-term incentive payments . Assuming a stock price increase of 5 percent for all companies over the life of the option grants awarded last year , the 764 executives will take in an additional $555 million . <p> * The median salary and bonus for executives in the survey was $400,583 , a 7.6 percent raise from 2003 's median . By contrast , the median annual pay for a worker in the Washington area was $37,610 in 2004 , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of compensation , the $704,713 median total pay received by the 764 executives in The Post survey was more than 18 times the median annual pay for the metropolitan area . <p> * The $40.6 million in salary and bonuses taken home collectively by the five highest-paid executives is twice the budget of the D.C. public library system . <p> The mix of compensation paid to executives changed in 2004 , moving from stock option grants and toward more cash , perks and other forms of long-term compensation . <p> The median option grant for the 100 highest-compensated executives in 2004 was $2.7 million , down 6 percent from 2003 . The median salary and bonus , meanwhile , rose 18 percent from 2003 , to $1.5 million . <p> Stock options give executives the right to buy company stock at the price on the date of the grant . If the stock price goes up , the executive can profit from the difference between the market value and his exercise price . For comparison purposes , The Post used an assumed stock price annual appreciation of 5 percent over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey . Some stock may prove to be worth more , while stock options at a company whose stock price declines are rendered worthless . <p> The median long-term compensation grant  --  usually in the form of long-term incentive plan payments or restricted stock grants  --  to the 100 highest-paid executives in 2004 was $660,000 , more than double what it was in 2003 . <p> Long-term incentive plans typically grant an executive cash for meeting three- to five-year performance goals . <p> Lucian A. Bebchuk , a professor of law and economics at Harvard Law School who has studied the effect of corporate governance and executive compensation on shareholder value for more than a decade , said the executive numbers in the Washington area mirror national trends . <p> " In response to a decline in shareholder enthusiasm for options , they 've channeled the growth in pay into everything but options , " he said . " But it 's not at all clear that this move , speaking broadly , has led to a considerable tightening of the pay-for-performance link . " <p> Bebchuk said boards of directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior executives that have nothing to do with creating shareholder value such as increasing stock price or building market-share dominance or other objective measurements . Rewards go up when value rises , but they tend to remain high even if value falls . <p> " The structure is what needs reforming , " Bebchuk said . " Boards hide behind boilerplate reasons " for increasing pay , such as peer group comparisons , that do n't address whether the shareholders have been rewarded . In addition , a range of benefits and payouts , such as severance agreements for executives who are fired or huge pension benefits for executives , often reward executives handsomely even if they screw up . <p> " If a large part of an executive 's career compensation comes from a pension , it decouples their pay from performance of the company , " he said .
