All that remains of the mud-and-concrete church building that nestled on the side of a pretty , eucalyptus-studded hill near the town of Kanungu , in southwestern Uganda , is a few sheets of corrugated tin that twist and snap in the wind . More than a week after leaders of an obscure indigenous Christian cult led , or perhaps forced , their followers into the building , poured gasoline around and then set , or had their followers set , fire to the place , the site has become a macabre graveyard . Police bulldozed the building and its grisly contents  --  at least 330 , and perhaps as many as 550 , charred corpses  --  into a trench dug by prisoners , burying the physical evidence but not erasing the horror of one of Uganda 's worst atrocities . " What most disturbs me is the children who died , " says Gervis Muteguya , who lost five relatives in the fire . " Children are innocent . They had no choice in this . " <P> Ugandan police agree and are treating the deaths as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compound belonging to the cult 31 miles from the church in Kanungu yielded at least 150 more bodies , including 60 children and mostly women who had been strangled and hacked to death . Officials were still trying to determine whether cult leader Joseph Kibwetere , 68 , died in the blaze or escaped . The onetime devout Roman Catholic teacher helped create the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God sect 10 years ago , after claiming he had been told by the Virgin Mary that the world would soon end . In the mid-1990s , he established a base in remote Kanungu . Using money provided by followers , who commonly sold their homes and possessions upon joining , and funds from groups and individuals overseas , Kibwetere built a small complex of houses , offices and a school . He recruited followers from nearby rural districts and from as far away as the capital , Kampala . <P> Among them were Muteguya 's mother , sister , brother , sister-in-law and niece . " I tried to stop them , but it was impossible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they lie buried . " They were indoctrinated in a manner that if you tried to argue with them , they kept quiet . You ended up talking around like a mad person . " Muteguya did manage to stop his relatives from selling the small family farm and late last year tried again to persuade his 16-year-old sister to leave the sect . " She came home to the village a few times , and I think she had given up because my mother had been transferred to a different place . But they knew our home , and they would come and take her by force . " That was around the time Kibwetere announced that the world would end on Dec. 31 . When it did n't , he apparently set a new date and urged his devotees to sell whatever possessions they had left . Locals said the cult held a party at which 70 crates of soft drinks and three bulls were consumed . Two days later , they were dead .               @ @ @ @ @ @
