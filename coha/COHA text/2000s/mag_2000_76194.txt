Robin Walton // 502 // 3 // Seven players tied with 2 // Olympian Shane Hamman Going for The Golf // Shane Hamman can hit the ball a ton , which is n't surprising considering that he can lift half a ton . What is surprising is how Hamman , a 28-year-old Olympic weightlifter who set the world record in the superheavyweight division for the squat ( 1,008 pounds ) , is able to swing a golf club around a body that 's as wide as a phone booth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose tale of the tape reads as follows : height , 5 ' 9 " ; weight , 360 pounds ; chest , 62 " ; biceps , 22 " ; thighs , 35 " . " As part of my training I stretch so many times a day I never let myself get tight . " He is so supple he can do a standing backflip and dunk a volleyball . // On the course Hamman turns fast enough to pound out 350-yard drives but also battles a nasty slice . Thanks to a deft short game , he has whittled his handicap to 14 . " A hundred twenty yards and in with my pitching wedge is my money shot , " says Hamman , who has played golf for seven years . // After graduating from Mustang ( Okla . ) High in 1990 , Hamman stocked watermelons at his father 's produce business for eight years . At about the same time , he tried powerlifting , teaching himself techniques for the squat , bench press and deadlift by reading magazines . " In my first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world records , " he says . But after watching the 1996 Games on TV , Hamman switched to Olympic-style weightlifting ( the snatch and the clean and jerk ) . " I saw how professional they were , " says Hamman , " and how much media there was . " // Although no one had ever successfully switched from power-to Olympic lifting , Hamman won die national superheavyweight crown his first time out , in 1997 , and has retained his tide every year since . Ranked ninth in the world , Hamman is considered a dark horse for a medal in Sydney . " Weightlifting is my sport , " he says , " but golf is my favorite sport . " // Despite the dichotomy between golf and weightlfting , Hamman finds similarities between the swing and the snatch : " Lifting the bar from the ground over your head in one move is not about muscling it up . It 's all about technique , timing and body position . When you do it right , it feels as if there is no weight on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure in golf , and it feels as if you did n't even swing . "  --  Scott Gummer // Reno-Tahoe Open Good News , Bad News // Sergio Garcia , Paul Lawrie , Jesper Parnevik and Jean Van de Velde 's loss is the Aug. 24-27 Reno-Tahoe Open 's gain . Those four golfers , all members of the 1999 European Ryder Cup team , were supposed to be hobnobbing with the top dogs on those dates at the NEC Invitational  --  a $5 million World tour event in Akron , created for the most recent Ryder and Presidents Cuppers . Instead , three of the four ( Parnevik is nursing a back injury ) are scheduled to go slumming with the P.H. Horgans of the PGA Tour in Reno . // Garc ? a blames the European tour for making him feel like a first-class citizen in a second-rate event Before the season Euro tour officials changed the eligibility for the NEC , limiting entry to the top 12 on that tour 's money list . That effectively eliminated the four Euros , who play in the U.S. more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NEC , " Garcia says . " I 'm not happy about this . " // Reno-Tahoe tournament director Jim Kline , though , is " going nuts . " Securing commitments from the three headliners was terrific news for an event that has struggled to stay alive since its title sponsor , Greens.com , took a powder last month . " We knew it was a sore subject for them , " Kline says . " It 's not like you can go up to them and say , ' Hey , too bad about Akron . Now you can come and play our event because we 're second-best . ' " // This article contains a table . Please see hardcopy of magazine or PDF.
