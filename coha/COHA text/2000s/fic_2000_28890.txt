The way my sister Mary Alice got us arrested was simple enough ; she hit the president of the bank over the head with my umbrella . Grabbed it right away from me and " thunk " let him have it . I think he was more surprised than hurt . There was hardly any blood , and everyone knows how much head wounds bleed . There was n't even a very big knot . Probably would n't have been one at all if he 'd had any hair . But he screeched like she 'd killed him and the security guard came rushing in , saw Mr. Jones staggering around holding his head , and pulled a gun on us . He looked like Barney Fife , the guard did , and chances were the bullet was in his pocket , but you just do n't take a chance on things like that . At least I do n't . Sister said later that she might have hit the guard , too , at least knocked the gun out of his hand , if he had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She also said she was surprised that Alcorn Jones , being a bank president , did n't have a higher threshold of pain . This sounds like my sister is aggressive , and she is , a little bit . For sixty-six years ( she says sixty-four ) she has n't bothered a lot of times to knock on doors . Things like that . But she 's not aggressive as in going around hitting bank presidents with umbrellas aggressive . Not usually . In fact , the whole time we were waiting at the jail for my husband , Fred , to come get us , she was worrying about whether or not the ladies of the investment club would think she was common as pig tracks for having hit Alcorn . I assured her that they would consider her a heroine , a true steel magnolia who had been protecting her honor . " You reckon ? " she asked , looking up hopefully . " Absolutely . You were protecting the club , too . After all , he was doing all of us wrong . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downright cheerful . " He got what he asked for . " I did n't know about that . It had landed us in the Birmingham jail . I had lived for sixty-one years with nothing but one speeding ticket on my record and here I was , incarcerated . " Mouse , " Sister said , " let 's ask the lady that put us in here for some stationery . We could write Haley a letter from the Birmingham jail . She 'd love that . " She probably would . Haley is my daughter who is currently living in Warsaw , Poland , with her new husband . She 'd think it was funny that her mama and Aunt Sister had landed in jail . " All sorts of famous people write letters from the Birmingham jail , " Mary Alice continued . " We 're not famous . " I was beginning to wish for my purse and some aspirin ; I rubbed my temples . " Why do you think the police took our purses ? " " They have us on a suicide watch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swear she 's half a bubble out of plumb . In fact , if our mother and father had n't sworn that we 'd been born at home , I 'd have been willing to bet that we had been mixed up somewhere . We do n't even look anything alike . Mary Alice is six feet tall ( she says five twelve ) and admits to two hundred fifty pounds . I 'm a foot shorter and weigh in at a hundred five . She used to be brunette with olive skin ; I used to be what Mama called a strawberry blonde , more wispy blonde than strawberry . Mary Alice also used to be five years older than I am , but she 's started backing up . This day in the Birmingham jail , she was Beach Blonde and I was more gray than strawberry . But I still had better sense . " Why would they have us on a suicide watch ? They do n't even have us locked up . " This was true . A very nice police lady had put us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y'all want anything , just holler . " " That 's what they do routinely . " Mary Alice sat down across from me at a small table and looked around . " If these walls could only speak . " " Lord . " I rubbed my temples harder . " You know you broke my umbrella . " " I 'll get you another one . " " But that was my kitten one . The one where you could see the kittens like they were looking through stained glass . Fred paid thirty-eight dollars for it at Rosenberger 's just because I was admiring it so . " Tears welled in my eyes . " We were eating supper at Chick-Fil-A and I spotted it in Rosenberger 's window . " Sister sighed . " I wish I had a Chick-Fil-A chicken salad sandwich . " The door opened and a policeman came in holding a clipboard . " Patricia Anne Hollowell ? " I looked up . " Yes . " " And Mary Alice Crane ? " Sister nodded . " Your lawyer is here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get us , " I said . " We do n't need a lawyer . " " Oh , yes you do . " Debbie Nachman , Sister 's daughter , stood in the door , looking very lawyerly in spite of the fact that her briefcase was clasped over a significantly pregnant belly . " What have you two done now ? " " It 's all your mama 's fault , " I said without a moment 's hesitation and with no guilt . " I do n't doubt that a minute . " Debbie laid her briefcase on the table , sat down , and pulled her shoes off . " Lord , I think my feet are swelling already . " Mary Alice did n't miss a beat . " My feet swelled like balloons before you were born . I had to stay in bed for the last two months . " Debbie grinned . " Point taken , Mama . " She pulled out a legal pad . " Now how about y'all tell me what happened . " " It 's a long story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed my arm . " Just the highlights , Mouse . I 'm starving . " Chapter Two This was November , so to explain exactly how we got into this predicament , I would need to back up a couple of months , probably to an early September afternoon when I was sitting in the den practicing smocking . I had signed up for a class at the Smocking Bird , thinking I would smock dresses for Debbie 's two-year-old twins for Christmas . Christmas trees and little drummer boys . I love hand-work , but I 'd never had the time to do much of it when I was teaching and raising a family . Now that I was retired , though , I was going to dress every child in the family with beautiful embroidered clothes . Of course the kids would rather have jeans , but that was beside the point . So I was practicing happily on an old soft blouse of mine , smocking and thinking about spending Christmas in Warsaw with Haley , which Fred , Mary Alice , and I were going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mitzi is my next door neighbor , has been for almost forty years . She 's also one of my favorite people , a pretty woman with no pretense about her . We 've helped each other through a lot of things during those years . " Hi , " I said . " Come on in and tell me what you think of these stitches . " Mitzi pushed her bifocals up on her nose and examined my work . " Looks good . " " Come on in the den . Oprah 's fixing to tell us what to read this month . You want some tea or something ? " " No , thanks . " " It 's Milo 's . I bought a jug of it yesterday at the Piggly Wiggly . Sweetened . " " Sounds good . But I just need to talk to you for a few minutes . " " Sure . Anything wrong ? " " No . Everything 's fine . " Oprah was holding up a book . I jotted the title down and turned the TV off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You remember Joy McWain ? " Mitzi sat on the sofa , reached across to the coffee table and took a lemon drop from the candy jar . " The name 's familiar . " " Connie Harris 's cousin , the pretty blonde one who used to work at Rich 's cosmetic counter . Married the McWain fellow who owns the Chevrolet place in Alabaster . She made a commercial for him once . She was a cheerleader . " " In the commercial ? " " I 'm surprised you do n't remember it . She 's got great big thighs . I mean really out of proportion . Those saddlebag things . " Mitzi sucked on the lemon drop thoughtfully and then pushed it back to her cheek . " I do n't think she did another one . " Sometimes Mitzi has to be encouraged over the finish line . " What about her ? " I asked . " She wants to start an investment club . You know , like the Beardstown ladies . She called Connie , and Connie thinks it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She said they 're going to get about fifteen or twenty women that they know they can depend on . I told her I 'd love to get in something like that and could I ask you , that you 're dependable . And she said sure . " The lemon drop came back to the middle and Mitzi pursed her lips . " Sounds good , " I said . " I do n't know a thing about the stock market but I 'd love to learn . As long as we do n't have to invest much . " " You think Mary Alice might be interested ? " " Hell , Mitzi , she already owns the stock market . " An exaggeration , but thanks to being widowed by three husbands who were all rich as Croesus , Mary Alice is not wanting in the money department . " But she might help us out with which stocks to buy . Tell us what her brokers are advising . " " I 'll mention it to her , " I said . " But she needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " " But you 're definitely interested . " " Absolutely . Just let me know when to show up for the first meeting . " " We 'll go together , " Mitzi promised . She stood up and stretched . " I 've got to go to the store . God knows what I 'm going to fix for supper . Arthur has suddenly decided he should be a vegetarian , says it 's better for his health . It probably is , but , Lord , sixty-four years old and Mr. Bread and Potatoes becomes a vegetarian . " She smiled . " I told him I 'd help him , but it 's going to be as hard for him as giving up smoking . Chances are he 's at Burger King right now downing a Whopper . " " I got some fresh asparagus at the Piggly Wiggly yesterday . Cost an arm and a leg . Came from Mexico . But it was delicious . " " That sounds good . " She stood in the back doorway for a moment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fred . He 'll eat anything . " I took this as a compliment . " And you 're lucky to have Arthur even if he is a vegetarian . More veggies would be good for all of us . " " I know . " She gave a little wave and went down the steps . I watched her cross the yard , a plump , pretty woman who looks younger than her sixty-four years . Something about the way she had said , " I know , " had n't sounded quite right . For a moment , I wondered if everything was all right next door . But then I shrugged and went back to my embroidering . Of course it was . I was smocking happily a few minutes later when the back door opened and Mary Alice called hello . " In the den , " I called back . " I 'm getting me some tea . " When she came into the room , I was surprised to see she was dressed in a cream colored pants suit that I had never seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like that outfit . Where 've you been so dressed up ? " She sank down on the sofa . " To Elmwood Cemetery . It 's Roger 's birthday . " Roger Crane was husband number three . " Did you take flowers to all of them ? " I asked . " Of course I did . I would n't want one of them to get their feelings hurt . " Mary Alice 's three husbands are buried next to each other . And , like she says , it 's convenient and they have n't complained . " That 's why I 'm dressed up , " she continued . " I like to think it makes them feel better . " And I 'd like to think she was kidding , but I did n't think she was . She ran a paper napkin over her forehead . " I 'm sweating like a whore in church , though . Damn it 's hot this year . " " It 's September . What do you expect ? " I handed her the blouse I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strange . How come you 're putting Christmas trees on an old blouse ? " I snatched it back . " I 'm practicing . I 'm going to make your granddaughters Christmas dresses . " " Oh . Well , that 's nice . " She turned up her tea and chuga-lugged half the glass . " Lord , I 'm hot . I took Bear Bryant some flowers , too . " " Why ? " " I just had n't taken him any in a while . " This was not as off-the-wall as it sounds . If you 're from Alabama , a visit to the Bear 's grave is like a pilgrimage . " How was the Bear ? " " Dead , Mouse . Just like he 's been for twenty years . " " Only his body , Sister . His spirit lives on . " Mary Alice looked at me appraisingly to see if I was serious , decided I was , and said , " True . " " Mitzi Phizer was just here , " I said , getting back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to get in an investment club some friends of hers are starting . I told her I would , but I did n't know about you . " Sister finished the tea and put the glass on the coffee table . " What kind of investment club ? " " You know . Like the Beardstown ladies . We pool a certain amount of money and invest it in the stock market . Everybody studies the market and makes suggestions . " " Coca-Cola 's done fine by me , " Sister said . " Tell them to buy Coca-Cola . " " Tell them yourself . It would be great to have someone in there who already knows something about the market . " Actually , I knew that Sister did n't know diddly about the market , but her broker was sharp . Sister seemed pleased . " Who all 's going to be in it ? " " Mitzi said it 's a woman named Joy McWain 's idea . A friend of Mitzi 's , Connie Harris , called Mitzi . " " Joy McWain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , looked at my sister , and asked her a simple question : was I the only one who missed out on things like big thighs in commercials ? " Probably . Those thunder thighs were hard to miss , Mouse . And the woman had on a cheerleading outfit , a short white pleated skirt and red satin underpants . Lord . Cheering for used cars . " She reached over , got a piece of ice from her glass , and popped it into her mouth . " Do n't you dare chew that . " " I 'm not . " Mary Alice smiled . " Mercy , you sound like Mama sometimes . " " That 's not bad . " " No . " I picked up my sewing again . I heard a suspicious crunching sound and Sister reached for another piece of ice . I swatted at the air since I was too far away to reach her . " Quit that ! What 's the matter with you ? " " Nervous , I guess . I 've got a blind date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her watch " two hours and fifteen minutes . " " How come that 's making you nervous ? You have blind dates all the time . " " But this one 's really blind . As in ca n't see . " " You mean he 's visually impaired ? " " No . He 's blind as a bat . He said so himself . When he asked me out , he said , It 'll take a little getting used to , Mary Alice , I 'm blind as a bat . But I 'd love to take you out tonight . ' " Sister reached for another piece of ice . " His name 's Judson Murphree . I met him at a benefit party for the museum . He 's a sculptor . " " Well , he sounds great . Sounds like he 's got his act together . " Sister nodded . " He 's also forty-three and handsome . " " Crunch " went another piece of ice . I got up and took the glass away from her . I was beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tell him you are ? " " Well when I found out he was really blind , I sort of lost my head . I said I was forty-five . " " Anything else ? ' " I said that I was tall and blonde , but that 's the truth , Mouse . " " And he asked you out . " " Well of course he did . A forty-five-year-old slender blonde with a good personality ? Of course he did . " " Slender ? " " He 's blind , Mouse . Like I said , I sort of lost my head . " " And now your conscience is hurting you ? " Mary Alice looked at me , puzzled . " Of course my conscience is n't hurting me . I 'm just worried that I 'll say something about remembering World War Two . " I swear talking with Sister is like playing ping-pong . I returned the serve . " Why would you say something about remembering World War Two ? " " Because I 'm worried about it . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drills during World War Two ? ' " " Why would you do that ? How many dates do you ask if they remember the air raid drills during World War Two ? Get real . It just does n't usually come up in a conversation . " I paused . " You really should n't have lied to him , though . " " I know . But it was such an opportunity . " She flicked something from her pants leg . " I think that was a flea . Has Woofer been on the sofa ? Or Muffin ? " I jumped to the defense of my old sweet dog and of Haley 's cat , Muffin , who was staying with us while our newly married daughter , Haley , was in Warsaw . " Woofer and Muffin do n't have fleas . If it was a flea , you brought it with you . " " Bubba does n't have fleas , either . " Which was probably true . Sister 's cat spends most of his time snoozing on a heating pad on her kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment . I got back to the subject at hand . " About the investment club . Are you interested ? " " Sure . I 'll bring Shirley Gibbs . " " Your stockbroker ? " " The one I 've told you about . She 's the one who told me to buy Intel stock when it first came on the market . " " She 's a professional , Sister . The fun of the club is that it 's a bunch of amateurs learning about the market , talking about the stocks and reading about them . Of course we could check it out with her later about the stocks we 've chosen . I doubt she 'd want to come anyway . " " Sure she would . We could decide what stocks to buy and Shirley could just nod yes or no . Besides , we 're going to need someone to buy the stocks when we decide . " " That 's true . I 'm not sure how these things work . I 'll check it out with Mitzi . " That answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Okay , but did I tell you about the condoms ? " " What condoms ? " " Shirley was recommending condom stocks back when everybody thought they were just for emergencies . " Condom emergencies ? I decided not to pursue it . " I 'll mention it to Mitzi , " I promised . I put down my sewing and followed her to the back door . " You have a good time tonight . " Frown lines appeared between her eyes . " Do you think I ought to offer to drive ? " " Play it by ear . " I stepped outside into the sunlight and watched Sister drive away . The large crape myrtle tree in the Phizers ' backyard was still in late summer bloom , the color of watermelon . The smocking could wait , I decided , and reached behind the kitchen door where Woofer 's leash hung . A good walk was what we both needed . Woofer 's igloo doghouse is the best of things and the worst of things . I purchased it for peace of mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him in his old doghouse . If the weather was very hot or cold , I 'd bring him into the house which he really did n't like very much . Woofer 's a yard dog . He ca n't dig holes or bark at squirrels in the house . So , after reading the brochure about the igloo with its promise of warmth and heat , I was sold . So was Woofer . He moseyed in , sniffed around , figured he 'd found dog heaven , and settled down . Even on beautiful sunny mild days , he has to be coaxed out , and for a few minutes he acts as if I 've insulted him . So I do n't have to worry about him getting cold or hot . I have to worry about him forgetting how to move . I coaxed him out with a couple of dog biscuits , put his leash on , and we headed down the sidewalk . The September smell of kudzu-covered hills and knotweed followed us and became mixed with the smell of cut grass ; yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tea olive blooming in someone 's yard . We had strolled for several blocks and had turned to go back home when a white Buick LeSabre pulled up beside us . A handsome man who looked to be in his early sixties let down the passenger window and leaned over . " Ma'am , " he asked , " what breed is your dog ? He 's so unusual . All those colors . " " Thank you . He 's a Norwegian possum hound . One of a kind . " " So they have possums in Norway ? " " Must have . " Woofer headed toward a utility pole pulling me along . The car followed . " Ma'am ? " " What ? " " Anybody ever tell you you have a cute butt ? " " My husband told me this morning . " " I 'm glad to hear he appreciates the finer things in life . " " He 's an appreciative man . " " Right now he 'd appreciate knowing there 's a cold beer in the refrigerator . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm appreciative . " I laughed . " Get , you fool . I 'll be home in a few minutes . " " I 'll be waiting . " He twirled an imaginary mustache and drove off . I patted Woofer . " Your papa 's a nice crazy man , Woofer . " Woofer wagged his tail in agreement . Mitzi was out in her front yard picking a bouquet of daylilies as we went by . " Wait , Patricia Anne , " she called . " Take some of these . " The flowers she brought to me were almost a rust color with a yellow throat . " These are gorgeous , " I said . " What kind are they ? " " I do n't know . I got them a couple of years ago from a lady out near Wildwood shopping center who has a whole field of irises and daylilies . I wanted some that bloom late . They are pretty , are n't they ? " " I 've never seen any this color . All mine are orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitzi agreed . " Did you ask Mary Alice about the investment club ? I saw her car at your house . " " I did , and she wants to join . She also wanted to bring her broker . " " She did ? " Mitzi frowned . " A broker 's input would be nice , but would n't we just figure the broker knew more than we did and not really study the stocks ? " " That 's what I told Sister , but she reminded me that we would need a broker to buy the stocks . " " Connie said something about doing that through a bank . Some banker who Joy McWain knows has volunteered to help . " I looked at Mitzi and grinned . " We 've got a lot to learn , have n't we ? Do you know anything at all about the stock market ? " " Lord no . My checkbook is n't even balanced . " I thought about Sister 's condom stock . " It 's going to be interesting to see what stocks Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be good ones . " " Do n't bet the farm . " I thanked Mitzi again for the flowers and hurried next door where there was a lovely man waiting who thought I had a cute butt .
