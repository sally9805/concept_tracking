Terminator Salvation Christian Bale , Sam Worthington , Anton Yelchin , Moon Bloodgood , Bryce Dallas Howard PG-13 3 stars ACTION Want to feel old ? The first Terminator came out 25 years ago . Now , after a six-year absence , the franchise is back and looking remarkably spry , given its advanced age . Terminator Salvation , a solid fourth entry in the series , is set in 2018 and sticks to the established mythology . An adult John Connor ( Bale , better than he has to be ) , now a leader of the human resistance movement against the ruling Skynet machines , must find Kyle Reese ( Yelchin ) , the teenager whom Connor will send back in time to father him ( see the original Terminator ) . Confusing ? You bet , but it makes a wacky kind of sense . The film has a gritty futuristic look , rousing action and a ruggedly appealing costar in Worthington , who plays a hybrid man-machine . Even original metalhead Arnold Schwarzenegger returns -- making good on his " I 'll be back " vow -- for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Battle of the Smithsonian Ben Stiller , Amy Adams , Owen Wilson , Hank Azaria PG 2 stars ANOTHER NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM ! FAMILY Maybe it 's the history major in me , but I was amused by this sequel to 2006 's Night at the Museum . It 's packed with departed greats who come to life ( howdy , Abe Lincoln ! ) in Washington , D.C. 's Smithsonian Institution to help ex-museum guard Larry Daley ( Stiller ) foil a despotic reanimated Egyptian pharaoh ( Azaria , ripely amusing ) . Unlike the first film , which was loud and labored , this one is loosey-goosey and crammed with fun asides . It includes one chase too many , but why complain when General Custer ( Bill Hader ) is leading the charge ? Minor quibble : Museum sneaks in paintings , such as Grant Wood 's " American Gothic , " that actually hang in other cities . Shhh , do n't tell the children . Easy Virtue Jessica Biel , Colin Firth , Kristin Scott Thomas PG-13 2 2 stars COMEDY Remember the Sesame Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like the others . One of these things just does n't belong " ? It kept running through my mind while watching a fetching Biel gamely try to keep up with practiced British comedy-of-manors experts Firth and Scott Thomas in this droll film version of a 1924 Nol Coward play . Biel plays a sexy American flapper who finds herself doing battle with her battle-ax of a snobby mother-in-law ( Scott Thomas ) in a musty English country mansion . Biel works hard but the effort shows , while Scott Thomas and Firth ( as Biel 's boozy sympathetic father-in-law ) sail along , earning laughs with the simplest of gestures or looks and yet conveying bitterness that runs deep . BOX WHERE ARE THEY NOW ? STARS OF TERMINATOR MOVIES PAST We know the original Terminator has been battling the California budget deficit , but what have the other stars of the series been up to ?

BOX MUSEUM 'S AMY ADAMS FINDS HER INNER AVIATRIX * The two-time Oscar nominee , 34 , shows off her sassy side as pilot Amelia Earhart , who comes back to life in the new sequel . ARE YOU AS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely somebody who thinks about things too much and looks before I leap . And I 'm afraid of flying ! It was fun to play somebody who lacked fear and was living in the moment . HOW DID YOU PREPARE FOR THE ROLE ? I 'm a bit of a detail-oriented perfectionist , so I did research on her . The character is sassy and fun . I work really hard to be polite , but I 'm actually quite a bit sassy too . WAS IT FUN WORKING WITH THE GUYS ON-SET ? I was like their adoptive younger sister . Ben Stiller is a big Rock Band fan , so we spent a lot of time playing . I 'm not as good at it , so Ben learned that the safe place for me was on vocals . YOU 'RE ENGAGED TO ACTOR DARREN LE GALLO . HOW 'S THE WEDDING PLANNING COMING ALONG ? I have n't planned it ! I have n't had any time . BOX DAMON WAYANS JR .
