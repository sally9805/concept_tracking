It was a September to remember ! In Moose County , 400 miles north of everywhere , plans were rife and hopes were high . First , the historic hotel in Pickax City , the county seat , was finally restored after the bombing of the previous year , and it would reopen with a new name , a new chef , and a gala reception . Then , a famous American ( who may or may not have slept there in 1895 ) was about to be honored with the city 's first annual Mark Twain Festival . Next , a distinguished personage from Chicago had reserved the presidential suite and would arrive on Labor Day , setting female hearts aflutter . To top it off , the tri-county Scottish Gathering and Highland Games would be held at the fairgrounds : bagpipes skirling , strong men in kilts tossing the caber , and pretty young women dancing the Highland Fling on the balls of their feet . The one unexpected happening was the homicide on the Pickax police blotter , but that was a long story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good folk of Pickax ( population 3,000 ) were quoting Mark Twain about the weather , suggesting ribald names for the hotel , and gossiping endlessly about a man named Delacamp ; few would ever meet him , but all had something to say about him . Jim Qwilleran , columnist for the Moose County Something , felt an air of anticipation when he made his rounds of downtown Pickax . When he went to the bank to cash a check , the young woman who counted out his fifties said , " Is n't it exciting ? Mr. Delacamp is coming again , and he always comes into the bank . I hope he comes to my window , but the manager usually handles his transactions . Anyway , it 's all so thrilling ! " " If you say so , " Qwilleran said . After a long career as a newspaperman he was seldom excited and certainly never thrilled . At the florist shop where he went to order a flowering plant for a sick friend , the wide-eyed assistant said breathlessly , " Did you hear ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh flowers in his hotel room , and he sends roses to his customers . " " Good ! " said Qwilleran . " Anything that helps the local economy has my approval . " While picking up a New York Times at the drugstore he heard a woman customer saying she had received an engraved invitation to Mr. Delacamp 's afternoon tea , and she wondered what kind of perfume to wear . The pharmacist 's wife said , " They say he likes French perfumes . We do n't carry anything like that . Try the department store . They can special-order . " Qwilleran crossed the street to the department store , his newshound instincts scenting a good story with human interest and a touch of humor . Lanspeak 's was a large fourth-generation store with new-fashioned merchandise but old-fashioned ideas about customer service . He found the two owners in their cramped office on the main floor . " Hi , Qwill ! Come on in ! " said Larry Lanspeak . " Have a cup of coffee , " said his wife , Carol . Qwilleran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but please tell me something . Explain the Delacamp mystique . " He knew the couple were official hosts for the man 's visit . " Why all the excitement ? " Larry looked at his wife , and she made a helpless gesture . " What can I say ? He 's an older man , but he 's handsome-elegant-gallant ! He sends women roses ! " " And kisses their hands , " said Larry with raised eyebrows . " He pays lavish compliments ! " " And kisses hands , " Larry repeated derisively . " Everything is very formal . Women have to wear hats to his Tuesday afternoon tea , and we 've sold out of millinery . We sell the basic felt that women wear to church , but our daughter said we should gussy them up with feathers and flowers and huge ribbon bows . So we did ! Diane is a sober , dedicated M.D. , but she has a mad streak . " " Takes after her mother , " Larry said . " The results are really wild ! Sorry you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is private , invitational , and exclusive . No publicity ! " " Okay . I 'll forget it . No story , " Qwilleran acquiesced . " But he sounds like an interesting character . . . You two go back to work . " Larry accompanied him out of the office and toward the front door , down the main aisle between cases of men 's shirts and ties and women 's scarves and earrings . " Old Campo is harmless , although a trifle phony , " he said . " Still , his visits every four or five years are good for a certain element in our community-and good public relations for the store . It 's Carol 's project , actually . I stay out of it . " The facts were that Delacamp was a dealer who bought and sold estate jewelry , making periodic visits to remote areas with a history of affluence . In such communities the descendants of old moneyed families might be willing to part with an heirloom necklace of rubies and emeralds , or a diamond tiara , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extravagant cruise . Artisans in Delacamp 's Chicago firm could break up such outdated items and re-mount them in rings , pendants , earrings , and so forth for sale to a new generation-as an investment or status symbol . Moose County fitted the picture , and Delacamp apparently had found his visits worthwhile . It had been the richest county in the state in the nineteenth century , when natural resources were being exploited and there was no income tax to pay . The old mining tycoons and lumber barons had built themselves mansions with large vaults in the basement . They had sent their offspring to eastern colleges and had taken their wives to Paris , where they bought them jewels that would appreciate in value . When the mines closed in the early twentieth century , the economy collapsed and most families fled to the big cities . Others elected to stay and live quietly on their private means , going into business or the professions-or even bootlegging during Prohibition . All of this convinced Qwilleran that Old Campo had a good thing going , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white-collar opinions were freely expressed : " He 'll be puttin ' on the dog and gettin ' the old gals all het up . " " They say he drinks nothin ' but tea , but ten to one he puts a little somethin ' in it . " " Yeah , I was night porter at the hotel a few years ago , and he used to send out for rum . He was a big tipper , I 'll say that for him . " " I know a guy-his wife drew ten thousand from their joint account and bought a diamond pin . " " I 'm glad my wife 's not on his list . Women go to that tea party of his and they 're pushovers ! " " He always brings a female assistant , and she always happens to be young and sexy . She 's supposed to be his cousin or niece or something , but you never notice any family resemblance , if you know what I mean . " Gossip was the mainstay of Moose County culture , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had their coffee shops ; women had their afternoon circles . Qwilleran listened to it and nodded and chuckled . He himself had been the subject of gossip . He was a bachelor who lived simply , and yet he was the richest man in the northeast central United States . Through a twist of fate he had fallen heir to the vast Klingenschoen fortune based in Moose County . Previously he had managed on a reporter 's salary without any particular interest in wealth ; in financial matters , moreover , he felt like a simpleton . He handled the situation by establishing the Klingenschoen Foundation with a mandate to give the money away judiciously to benefit the community . Needless to say , " Mr. Q " had become an icon in the north country , not only because of his generosity . He wrote a twice-weekly column , " Straight from the Qwill Pen , " that was the most popular feature in the newspaper . He had a genial disposition and a sense of humor , even though his brooding eyes gave him a look of melancholy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made the natives into a race of determined individualists , as a glance at the map would confirm . There were places like Squunk Corners , Little Hope , Sawdust City , Chipmunk , and Ugley Gardens . Qwilleran belonged in this environment . He spelled his name with a QW , lived in a barn with two cats , sported an enormous pepper-and-salt moustache , and rode a recumbent bicycle which required him to pedal with feet elevated . There were other characteristics in his favor . Being tall and well - built , he had a distinct aura of authority . Being a journalist , he had trained himself to listen . Strangers felt they could confide in him , air their dreams , relate their woes . He always listened sympathetically . One of Qwilleran 's quirks was his desire for privacy . He needed solitude for thinking , writing , and reading , and his converted barn was effectively secluded . Though within the city limits and not far from Main Street , it had acreage . It had once been a strip farm extending from Main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the east . Paving was unknown in those days . Now Main Street divided into northbound and southbound traffic lanes , called Park Circle . Around the rim were two churches , the courthouse , a majestic old public library , and the original Klingenschoen mansion , now functioning as a small theatre for stage productions . To the rear of the mansion was a four-stall carriage house with servants ' quarters upstairs . From there a rustic wagon trail wound its way through evergreen woods , ending in a barnyard . The hundred-year-old apple barn rose like an ancient castle-octagonal in design , four stories high , with a fieldstone foundation and siding of weathered shingles . Odd-shaped windows had been cut in the walls , reflecting the angled timbers that framed the interior . The property to the east had been a thriving orchard until a mysterious blight struck the trees . Now it was reforested , and wild gardens attracted birds and butterflies . On the last day of August Qwilleran walked down the old orchard lane to pick up his mail and newspaper on Trevelyan Road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was now a rustic contemporary building housing the Pickax Art Center . County residents attended classes there , viewed exhibitions , and-in some cases-rented studios . As Qwilleran passed it , he counted the cars in the parking lot . It looked as if they were having a good day . The highway marked the city limits . Beyond it was farmland . He waved to a farmer chugging down the road on a tractor and the driver of a farm truck traveling in the opposite direction . His rural mailbox and a newspaper sleeve were mounted on posts alongside the pavement . There were few letters in the box ; his fan mail went to the newspaper office , and official business and junk mail went to the law firm that represented the Klingenschoen Foundation . A boy carrying a grocery sack was running toward him from the direction of the McBee farm . " Mr. Q ! Mr. Q ! " he shouted . It was the ten-year-old Culvert McBee . " I brought you something ! " Qwilleran hoped it was not turnips or parsnips from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Culvert . " The chubby boy was breathing hard after running . " I made something for you . . . I took a summer class . . . over there . " He jerked his head toward the art center and then handed over the sack . " What is it ? " " Look inside . " Qwilleran was dubious about knickknacks made for him by fond readers , and he peered into the sack with no great expectations . What he saw was a pad of paper stapled on a small board . The top sheet was computer-printed with the well-known saying Thirty Days Hath September . " It 's a calendar , " Culvert explained . " Every day you tear off a page and read what it says . " The second page had the date ( September 1 ) and the day ( Tuesday ) and a brief saying : Let sleeping dogs lie . " Well ! This is really something ! " Qwilleran said with a good show of enthusiasm . He flipped through the pages and read : What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . You can lead a horse to water but you ca n't make him drink . . . A cat can look at a king . " Where did you get these sayings , Culvert ? " " At the library . They 're from all over the world . " " They 're all about animals ! " " Yep . " " Well , I certainly appreciate your thoughtfulness ! " " There 's a hole in the board . You can hang it on a nail . " " I 'll do that . " " I made one for my mom , too . " " How are your parents ? I have n't seen them lately . " " Dad 's okay . Mom has a sore hand from using the computer . " " How about the dogs ? " Culvert had a shelter for old , unwanted dogs . " Dolly died of old age and I buried her behind the shed . I painted her name on a stone . You can come and look at it if you want to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nice of her . Are you ready to go back to school ? " " Yep . " Then Qwilleran praised the calendar once more , and Culvert walked back to his farm on Base Line Road .. . . At the art center there was a familiar car parked on the lot , and Qwilleran went in to talk with his friend , Thornton Haggis . He was a retiree with a shock of white hair , now serving as interim manager until they could find a replacement for Beverly Forfar . " Still holding the fort , I see , " Qwilleran said . " Has anyone heard from Bev ? " " No . After the turmoil she experienced here , I believe she was glad to wash her hands of our fair city . " The former manager had written to Qwilleran , however , thanking him profusely for his farewell gift , little knowing it was something he had been trying to unload . She had written , " It was so wonderful of you to arrange for me to have The Whiteness of White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admired by everyone . You may be interested to know I have found a small job in Ann Arbor , Michigan , that could develop into something big . " Qwilleran nodded . From what he knew of that city it had the right climate for an esoteric intaglio . He had won it in a raffle at the art center , simply because he was the only one who bought a chance . He bought several , using the alias of Ronald Frobnitz . As the winner he was trying to dispose of it discreetly without offending the artist who had donated it . Luckily Beverly Forfar was leaving Pickax forever , and she was happy to acquire an artwork valued at a thousand dollars . In a postscript to her letter she had written , " If you are in touch with Professor Frobnitz in Japan , please thank him for his generosity . I 'm sorry I did n't meet him while he was in Pickax . On the telephone he sounded positively charming . " Qwilleran asked Thornton , " Any good prospects for Beverly 's successor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't seem to make a decision . " " You 're doing too good a job , Thorn . Why hire a manager when good old Thorn will do the work free ? " " Do n't think that has n't crossed my mind ! After September thirtieth , I quit ! Meanwhile we 're setting up the craft fair . Are you coming to the opening ? I 'll have a few of my own things on exhibit . " " Are you doing something creative in tombstones ? " Qwilleran asked lightly . Thornton was a retired stonecutter who had studied art history at one time . " You can kid all you like , " he retorted , " but I felt the need for a manual hobby . I bought a lathe , and now I 'm doing woodturning in my basement . " " That I 've got to see ! " Qwilleran said . " Then come to the craft fair , " his friend said . " Bring money . " When Qwilleran walked up the lane to the apple barn , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a drive-through barn with huge doors east and west , large enough to admit a horse-drawn wagon loaded with apples . Now the huge openings had been filled in and equipped with human-size doors . On the east side there were handsome double doors flanked by glass panels . These were the front doors , opening into the foyer , although they were on the back of the building . The back door was , of course , on the front , opening into the kitchen . ( This kind of anomaly was common in Moose County , where Pickax was referred to as Paradox . ) Twice the Pickax voters had vetoed a proposal to change the names of streets . " Old East Street " was west of " New West Street , " and there was confusion about " North Street East " and " South Street West . " Only strangers were befuddled , however , and befuddling strangers was a local pastime . As Qwilleran approached the double doors , two Siamese cats watched from the sidelights , standing on their hindlegs with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to wade through weaving bodies and waving tails , circling him , doubling back , rubbing his ankles , and getting under his feet-all the while yowling in the operatic voices of Siamese . The tumultuous welcome would have been flattering if Qwilleran had not consulted his watch . It was feeding time at the zoo ! " What have you guys been doing this afternoon ? " he asked as he prepared their dinner . " Anything worthwhile ? Solve any world problems ? Who won the fifty-yard dash ? " The more you talk to cats , the smarter they become , he believed . The long , lean , lithe muscular one was Kao K'o Kung , familiarly known as Koko . His female companion was Yum Yum-small , dainty , shy , although she could shriek like an ambulance siren when she wanted something and wanted it immediately . Both had pale fawn-colored fur and seal brown masks , ears and tails . Her eyes were blue tinged with violet , and their appealing kittenish gaze could break hearts . Koko 's deeper blue eyes had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were indoor cats , but the barn interior was as big as all outdoors to a small creature weighing ten pounds or less . The space , a hundred feet in diameter , was open to the roof . A ramp spiraled up the walls and connected the balconies on three levels . In the center stood a huge white fireplace cube with white stacks soaring to the cupola , and it divided the main floor into functional areas : dining , lounging , foyer , and library . The kitchen was under a balcony , half hidden by an L-shaped snack bar . In the daytime a flood of light came through triangles and rhomboids of glass . Pale colors prevailed-in the bleached timbers , upholstered furniture , and Moroccan rugs . After dark , when a single switch activated indirect lights and artfully placed spotlights , the effect was nothing less than enchanting . Qwilleran 's favorite haunt was the library area . One wall of the fireplace cube was covered with bookshelves , and the shelves were filled with secondhand classics purchased from a local bookseller . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and writing materials . In a capacious lounge chair with an ottoman Qwilleran liked to read aloud to the Siamese or draft his column on a legal pad with a soft lead pencil . On the last day of August , before going out to dinner , he read to the cats from a book selected by Koko . He was the official bibliocat . He prowled the bookshelves and liked to curl up between the biographies and the nineteenth-century English fiction . At reading time it was his privilege to select the title , although Qwilleran had the power of veto . They had been reading Greek drama . Koko could sense which book was which , and he repeatedly sniffed The Frogs by Aristophanes . " Okay , we 'll do it once more , " Qwilleran said , " but this is the last time ! " Both cats liked the froggy chorus that he dramatized so colorfully : brekekekex koax koax . Yum Yum 's eyes grew wide , and a rumble came from Koko 's chest . " Those cats are just like little kids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was three years old , I wanted to hear Jack and the Beanstalk over and over again . It was in desperation that my mother taught me to read so young . " He was dining with the chief woman in his life , a charming companion of his own age , whose gentle voice , soft smile , and agreeable disposition camouflaged a will as strong as Yum Yum 's . She was Polly Duncan , director of the public library . She always wore something special for their dates , and this time it was a green silk dress with a necklace of long slivers of silver alternating with beads of green jade . " You look lovely ! " he said . He had learned not to say , " You look lovely tonight . " That would imply that she usually looked unlovely . Polly was sensitive about the niceties of speech . Pleased , she said , " Thank you , dear . And you 're looking very handsome ! " He always wore a coat and tie , well coordinated , when having dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . They had a reservation at Onoosh 's in downtown Pickax , a caf with the exotic murals , lamps , brasses , and aromas of the Mediterranean rim . Ethnic foods were finally being accepted 400 miles north of everywhere , although it had been a slow process . Seated at the brass-topped tables were foodists with adventurous palates , vacationers from out of town , and students from Moose County Community College , who were eligible for a discount . For starters Polly had a dry sherry and Qwilleran ordered Squunk water on the rocks with a twist , a local mineral water . " What 's the latest gossip at the library ? " he asked . It was a center of information in more ways than one . " Has the Pickax grapevine blown a gasket over Mr. Delacamp ? " " No , no ! " she corrected him with excitement . " The latest news is about Amanda ! Have n't you heard ? " " I heard the rumor in July , while you were in Canada , but she denied it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I think she was building up suspense . There 's nothing naive about Amanda ! " " So what 's the latest ? " he asked impatiently . As a journalist he always felt uncomfortable if he did n't know the latest . " Well ! Today was the deadline , and she picked up her petition at city hall at nine a.m . Eight hours later , she returned it with the required number of signatures-five percent of registered voters ! She stood in front of Toodle 's Market and Lanspeak 's and created quite a stir , as you can well imagine . " " That 's our Amanda ! " Qwilleran gloated . There was only one illustrious Amanda in Pickax . As owner of the design studio on Main Street she had decorated the homes of well-known families for forty years . She had served on the city council for twenty years-always outspoken and sometimes cantankerous . The locals loved her for her fearless individualism , and that included her eccentric dress and grooming . Now she was daring to challenge the incumbent mayor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms , simply because his mother was a Goodwinter . That was the big name in Pickax . The four Goodwinter brothers had founded the city in 1850 . But the mayor 's name was Gregory Blythe . His challenger was Amanda Goodwinter ! Qwilleran said , " I predict she 'll win by a landslide . " A bright young woman in an embroidered vest served them baba ghanouj and spanokopetes , and he said , " I wish my mother could see me now-eating spinach and eggplant . And liking it ! " Then he asked , " What 's the latest on Old Campo ? " " How can you be so derisive ? " Polly rebuked him . " The jealousy among our male population is ludicrous ! A few members of my library board are on his guest list , and they say he 's a grand gentleman with polished manners and great charisma ! " " I hear he always has a girl Friday who travels with him and happens to be young , sexy , and related by blood . " He said this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriousness , " He 's training family members to take over the business when he retires . . . . Or so I 'm told , " she added . " But the big news is that Carol has asked me to pour at his celebrated Tuesday Tea ! Those opals you gave me were ordered by Carol from a Chicago jeweler . That was Delacamp 's firm , and so I 'm suddenly in the inner circle . " " Just what does he do when he 's in town ? " " Well , first he gives an exclusive tea for potential customers . Then families with heirloom jewelry to sell invite him to their homes , and those who wish to buy vintage jewelry from his private collection make appointments to meet him in his hotel suite . " Qwilleran considered the situation briefly and then asked , " If he 's so discriminating , how did he react to the old hotel with its broken-down elevators and wretched food ? " " He had the good taste not to criticize or make fun of it . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm having stage fright about pouring tea for him . " " Nonsense , Polly . You 're always in control , and now that you 've had your surgery , you 're healthier and livelier and more admirable than ever . " The young waitress serving the entrees grinned to see " an older couple " holding hands across the table . " Do n't snicker , " Qwilleran told her . " It 's an old Mediterranean custom . " For a few moments they contemplated the presentation of food on the plate-stuffed grape leaves for her , curried lamb for him-and the subtlety of the flavors . Then he asked , " What are you wearing to the reception Saturday night ? " " My white dinner dress and the opals . Are you wearing your kilt with your dinner jacket ? " " I think it would be appropriate . " The grand opening of the refurbished hotel would be a black-tie event at three hundred dollars a ticket , proceeds going to Moose County 's Literacy Council . There would be champagne , music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I 'm getting a preview of the preview . Fran Brodie is sneaking me in . " " It was a stroke of genius to rename the hotel , considering its grim reputation in the past . " " The new sign is going up Thursday . " Conversation lapsed into trivia : The theatre club was opening its season with Night Must Fall . The art center had been unable to replace Beverly Forfar . Celia Robinson had married Pat O'Dell and had moved into his big house on Pleasant Street , leaving the carriage-house apartment vacant . When finally they left the restaurant , Qwilleran asked , " Would you like to stop at the barn and see my new calendar ? " " For just a minute . I have to go home and feed the cats . " It was twilight when they drove into the barnyard . A faint , dusky blue light seemed to bathe the world . It was the breathless moment after sunset and before the stars appeared , when all is silent . . . waiting . " Magical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word for it : l'heure bleue . " " There 's a French perfume by that name . I imagine it 's lovely . " Eventually they went indoors to look at the calendar , and eventually Polly went home to feed Brutus and Catta . Qwilleran took the Siamese out to the screened gazebo , and the three of them sat in the dark . The cats liked the nighttime . They heard inaudible sounds and saw invisible movement in the shadows . Suddenly Koko was alert . He ran to the rear of the gazebo and stared at the barn . In two or three minutes the phone rang indoors . Qwilleran hurried back to the main building and grabbed the receiver after the sixth or seventh ring . The caller was Celia Robinson O'Dell , who had been his neighbor in the carriage-house apartment . " Hi , Chief ! " she said cheerfully , her voice sounding young for a woman of her advancing age . " How 's everything at the barn ? How are the kitties ? " " Celia ! I 've been trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you 're hard to reach . " " We took a little honeymoon trip . We went to see Pat 's married daughter in Green Bay . He has three grandchildren . " " How do you like living on Pleasant Street ? " " Oh , it 's a wonderful big house with a big kitchen , which I need now that I 'm going into the catering business seriously . But I enjoyed living in the carriage house and running over with goodies for you and the kitties . I can still cook a few things for your freezer , you know , and Pat can deliver them when he does your yardwork . " " That 'll be much appreciated by all three of us . " " And if there are any little . . . secret . . . missions that I can handle for you . . . " " Well , we 'll see how that works out . Give Pat my congratulations . He 's a lucky guy . " As Qwilleran hung up the phone , he stroked his moustache dubiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked to snoop in matters that were none of his business-propelled by curiosity or suspicion-and he had relied on Celia to preserve his anonymity . She was an ideal undercover agent , being a respectable , trustworthy , grandmotherly type . And , as an avid reader of spy fiction , she enjoyed being assigned to covert missions . There had been briefings , cryptic phone calls , hidden tape recorders , and secret meetings in the produce department at Toodle 's Market . Now , as a married woman , how long could she retain her cover ? As for Qwilleran , there was nothing official about his investigations . He simply had an interest in crime , stemming from his years as a crime reporter for newspapers Down Below-as locals called the metropolitan areas to the south . In recent years he had uncovered plenty of intrigue in this small community , and in doing so he had won the trust and friendship of the Pickax police chief . It was an association that would continue , with or without his secret agent . From " The Cat Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) November , 1999 , Lilian Jackson Braun used by permission .
