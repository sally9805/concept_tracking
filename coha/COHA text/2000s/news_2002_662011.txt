" <p> CBS News " has evaluated these pictures and made a news judgment to broadcast them in a responsible way , mindful not to jeopardize national security , " spokeswoman Kelli Edwards said . <p> CNN did n't air its footage , though it did show images shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press in wartime are nothing new , and the fact is we are on their base and subject to their rules , " said network spokeswoman Megan Mahoney . <p> Rob Curtis , a photographer for The Army Times who often takes photos for The Associated Press , said he objected to being barred from transmitting photos he had taken of the prisoners ' departure . <p> " We signed papers that said we would not publish photos that endangered a military operation , " Curtis said . " There are no military implications for these photos , only political . " <p> The AP is protesting the Pentagon 's action . <p> " We feel this is an important news event and it is our job to provide coverage of important news events , " said Vincent Alabiso , AP vice president and executive photo editor . " We see no reason that these pictures should be barred from release . " <p> Photographers and camera crews from CNN , CBS , The Army Times and other organizations were allowed to take pictures of the 20 prisoners in Kandahar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cuba . But the journalists had to agree not to transmit the images until military officials gave permission . <p> Shortly after the plane left the airport , the organizations were told not to send the images . <p> A Pentagon spokesman said the decision was made because the Red Cross raised an objection , contending the images would violate international laws on the treatment of prisoners . <p> " The Geneva Convention prohibits humiliating , debasing photos , " said Rear Adm . Craig Quigley . " We need to be cautious in case there is a legal action somewhere downstream . " <p> Officials at the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva said the organization had not contacted the Pentagon about photographs taken in Afghanistan . <p> " They may have our stance on the issue in their files but we did not raise an objection , " said Vincent Lasser , a Red Cross spokesman . <p> &gt;+++++ Judge denies Flynt 's request for access to military missions <p> WASHINGTON ( AP ) - Hustler publisher Larry Flynt lost the first round in a court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with U.S. forces on combat missions in Afghanistan . <p> U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman denied Flynt 's request on Jan. 8 for a preliminary injunction to bar the Pentagon from denying his reporters access while his lawsuit against the Defense Department is pending . <p> It " is far from clear " whether Flynt ultimately will prevail or has suffered sufficient harm , Friedman said . <p> He said coverage has increased " and the media now has some level of open access to American troops on the ground in Afghanistan . " <p> On Oct. 30 Flynt first asked for his employees to accompany U.S. ground troops on operations ; he repeated his request Nov. 12 . The Pentagon offered access only to such missions as humanitarian food drops and airstrikes and promised to try to expand privileges later . Flynt sued Nov. 16 . <p> At the time of Flynt 's request , soldiers were entering Afghanistan only in small numbers on highly specialized missions . Now that hundreds of Marines and other military forces are in the country , some restrictions on reporters are being lifted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalists have a constitutional right to document front-line hostilities firsthand , even under specific guidelines . <p> " The court is persuaded that in an appropriate case there could be a substantial likelihood of demonstrating that under the First Amendment the press is guaranteed a right to gather and report news involving United States military operations on foreign soil subject to reasonable regulations , " Friedman wrote . <p> He also rapped the Pentagon for expressing its commitment to providing press access to military operations " somewhat vaguely and with minimal detail . " <p> Flynt said he considered Friedman 's ruling a victory , praising his assertion that the First Amendment could establish the media 's right to be present on the battlefield . <p> Government lawyers had argued that the media have no constitutional right to battlefield access . <p> &gt;+++++ Rumsfeld says tough questions from the press are helpful <p> WASHINGTON ( AP ) - Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld defended the press corps that peppers him with questions at Pentagon briefings , saying the rough-and-tumble is " really , truly helpful " to the discussion of national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington Journal " on Jan. 8 , Rumsfeld was asked how he deals with " a constant barrage of hostile questions " at news conferences . <p> " The truth is that the tougher the question , the more likely it 's a question that people in the listening audience want to hear the answer to , " he replied . <p> " And to the extent that 's the case , it 's helpful - really , truly helpful - to have difficult questions asked , so that you have an opportunity to discuss them and explain and add some dimension and texture to the subject . " <p> A recent column in The Wall Street Journal dubbed Rumsfeld 's press briefings " the best new show on television . " <p> During the C-SPAN call-in show , the defense secretary listened intently to each question and sprinkled his answers with chuckles and comments like " Goodness gracious ! " <p> One caller asked him to compare his service in the first Bush administration to his current job . Rumsfeld gently reminded the caller he had actually served in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife reminds him of the necessity for give-and-take with the news media . <p> " When I leave the house in the morning my wife , Joyce , says , ' Now , Don , they have their job and you have yours . ' And it 's true , they do have their job , and their job is to ask questions and to contribute to the national debate and dialogue on these very important issues . " <p> Rumsfeld called the briefing ritual " an amazing process " that is " particularly difficult , of course , during a conflict . " <p> Asked whether his televised briefings are popular because of his " charisma " or the public 's new interest in national security , Rumsfeld laughed heartily . <p> " No , it 's the fact that the subject matter is so important to our country , " he said . <p> &gt;+++++ <p> ATTACKS-COURT-MEDIA : <p> Networks argue for televising Moussaoui 's trial <p> ALEXANDRIA , Va . ( AP ) - A trial that could reveal Osama bin Laden 's internal operations should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moussaoui argued Jan. 9 . <p> Moussaoui , the only person accused of conspiring with bin Laden and the hijackers to kill and maim thousands , sat at the defense table in a green prison jumpsuit , cocking his head slightly to hear the arguments . <p> His lawyer , Edward MacMahon Jr. , was joined by TV networks in seeking to overturn a ban on cameras . He argued only briefly during the hearing , telling U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema that his client believes televising the proceedings would provide " an added layer of protection " in guaranteeing a fair trial . <p> Brinkema said she would rule no earlier than Jan. 15 . <p> Most of the arguments during the half-hour hearing were conducted by a lawyer for Court TV and C-Span in favor of live coverage and an attorney from the Justice Department opposing it . <p> " The entire nation has a direct interest in these proceedings , if not the entire world , " said Lee Levine , an attorney representing the networks . He contended that the ban - first imposed on still cameras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth Collery said the government is concerned that witnesses ' testimony would be affected if they knew they were on live television . That , in turn , she said , could affect the jurors . <p> Brinkema said she also is concerned about the security of witnesses and other trial participants . Having not only television pictures but permanent images of witnesses , the judge and others on the Internet long after the trial " could be a chilling problem , " she said . <p> During the hearing , two small television cameras that could hardly be seen were turned on to televise the proceeding to a nearby overflow room for those who could not get seats . <p> The judge said the small cameras show how technology has changed to make TV less intrusive , but Collery said the same security concerns remain regardless of improvements in the technical equipment . <p> Also responding to the judge 's question on whether radio broadcast should be permissible , Collery said , " I still think dangers ... exist " because witnesses would remain self-conscious about their testimony . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trial to those sitting in the courtroom provides the same public access as television . <p> " The right to observe is the right to observe what goes on in the courtroom , " Levine said . " Observation is seeing as well as hearing . " <p> He said the public , because so many state and local trials are televised , " is now comfortable that television is an unobtrusive medium " in the courtroom . <p> Collery , however , argued : " There is not a long-standing tradition of cameras in the courtroom . " While public seating is often limited , she said , " it 's never been necessary to hold them ( trials ) in amphitheaters . " <p> At least some courts in every state allow televised state and local trials . Others media organizations supporting a trial broadcast include the Radio-Television News Directors Association , CNN , the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press , NBC , CBS and ABC . <p> While the position of the news organizations was hardly a surprise , the issue took on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that live broadcast would help guarantee a fair trial . <p> Federal prosecutors countered that everyone involved would be endangered by live television because al-Qaida members almost certainly would be tuned in . <p> Among trials of people alleged to have al-Qaida links was last year 's conviction in New York of four men in the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa . <p> Moussaoui faces indictments on six counts , charging him with conspiring with al-Qaida members and the Sept. 11 hijackers to kill and maim thousands of people . Facing a possible death penalty if convicted , he has entered no plea . Brinkema lodged an innocent plea for him . <p> TV experts said a televised trial probably would get extensive , if not gavel-to-gavel , coverage on CNN , Fox News Channel and MSNBC . Broadcast networks were less certain of their plans , in part because jury selection is not scheduled until Sept. 30 . <p> &gt;+++++ <p> San Francisco Examiner fires editor in chief in latest shakeup <p> SAN FRANCISCO ( AP ) - The San Francisco Examiner has fired its editor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the Fang family took over the paper from the Hearst Corp . <p> David Burgin , 62 , was the second editor to hold the paper 's top spot in the 14 months since the Fangs took control of the afternoon daily , brought in a new staff and began morning publication . <p> Burgin will be replaced by Zoran Basich , 35 , who has served as editorial page editor . <p> " I think Dave Burgin did a great job here at the Examiner and got the paper on its feet when it needed a strong hand , " Basich said . <p> In an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle , Burgin said he received a call late Jan. 10 from Publisher Florence Fang , who read him a letter notifying him he was being fired . <p> " She told me our styles were incompatible , " Burgin said , describing his leaving as " really not a big deal . " <p> " I quietly went in , " he said , " did the best I could , and I 'm quietly leaving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not returned . <p> Burgin 's departure ends yet another chapter in the short but tumultuous history of the Examiner under the Fangs . In October , Fang removed her son Ted as publisher and assumed his duties . <p> The Fang family began publishing the Examiner as a morning paper on Nov. 22 , 2000 . As part of Hearst 's purchase of the San Francisco Chronicle , the Fangs received a three-year , $ 66 million subsidy to publish the Examiner and keep alive a second metropolitan daily newspaper in the city . <p> Before he was hired by the Fangs , Burgin had been editor of the Examiner in 1985 and 1986 , when it was owned by Hearst . Before returning to the Examiner , he was editor of the Dallas Times Herald and editor in chief of the Houston Post and the Alameda Newspaper Group . <p> When Burgin was hired to run the new Examiner in December 2000 , Ted Fang said Burgin " loves a good challenge , and let 's face it , we 've got one .

His editor , seeing a conflict , told him to choose between the two . Rosetta picked the torch . <p> News organizations throughout Utah are grappling with the same ethical question over reporters participating in an event they are covering : Journalists from four of the state 's six dailies will carry the torch as it heads for Salt Lake City . <p> Salt Lake Tribune editor James E. Shelledy said he did n't think twice before making his decision about the torch . <p> " Our ethical guidelines state if you are directly involved in reporting or editing a news story you ca n't be part of that event , " he said . " This is not just about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrity of the news gathering . That is all I can protect . " <p> The newspaper will allow two people - a popular columnist and the publisher - to carry the torch . Shelledy said the two men have a sufficient distance from news reporting to preserve the paper 's objectivity . <p> The city 's other daily , the Mormon-church owned Deseret News , will allow anyone on staff to carry the torch . Six people from the paper already have or will , said Rick Hall , managing editor . Hall is one of them , as is the reporter who led the paper 's coverage of the scandal in which planners were accused of paying off International Olympic Committee members . <p> " The torch is not graft or bribery or a gift , " Hall said . " Reporters need to be removed from stories to ( be sure ) they are not compromised . We did n't see this as a conflict because it wo n't change the way we cover the Olympics . " <p> Reporters at the Standard-Examiner in Ogden and The Daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1996 Summer Olympics , The Atlanta Journal-Constitution assigned two reporters to run in the torch relay and cover it from a first-person perspective , sports editor Robert Mashburn said . <p> The problem becomes even stickier when news organizations - such as NBC - tie themselves financially to the success of the games . Brink Chipman , news director for local NBC affiliate KSL , said the station faces continuous questions about the impartiality of the station 's reporting . <p> NBC paid $ 545 million for the U.S. rights to broadcast the 2002 Games , part of a multibillion-dollar contract for the same rights to every Olympics through 2008 . <p> " I think we 're all in an awkward situation , " he said . " We are a sponsor , but that has not stopped us from doing broad , intense coverage of the Olympics . If we did n't cover them honestly and legitimately , people would write about it and report it . ... We 'd be killed . " <p> Chipman said the station 's policy is to allow " personalities " such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporters or editors . <p> NBC is n't the only news outlet with financial ties to the games . <p> The Tribune and The Deseret News each donated free advertising space to the Salt Lake Organizing Committee in exchange for tickets to events . <p> Bob McClory , associate professor at Northwestern 's Medill School of Journalism , said ethical concerns sometimes can be carried too far . He thinks Rosetta 's case is an example . <p> " This is simply an honor for an old grizzled journalist . We 're not talking about revealing state secrets , " he said . <p> Rosetta , 60 , said he planned to retire before the Olympics , but his editor asked him to stay because his experience was needed . Now he wonders why he flew around the country covering figure skaters for nearly two years . <p> " I 've been a patriot from the get-go and this is the American thing to do , " he said .

It was once part of the 28-acre parcel purchased for the newspaper 's grounds . <p> Gannett owned the newspaper until October 2000 , when it was transferred to the California Newspaper Partnership , which is controlled by MediaNews Group of Denver .
