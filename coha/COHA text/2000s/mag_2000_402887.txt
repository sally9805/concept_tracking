<p> A HANDFUL OF HOT STARTUPS ARE EXPLOITING NATURE 'S OWN METHODS  --  VASTLY ACCELERATED  --  IN ORDER TO BREED BETTER DETERGENTS , DRUGS AND CROPS . <p> To catch a glimpse of evolution , Pim Stemmer does n't have to set sail for the Galapagos . He need n't trudge through the Costa Rican rain forest or blast into Antarctic sea ice . For a front-row view of evolution in action , Stemmer simply walks over to a lab bench at Maxygen , a biotech startup in Redwood City , Calif. , where he oversees research and development . At Maxygen , researchers are tapping evolutionary principles to " breed " new proteins , successively fine-tuning specific traits  --  say , heat tolerance or the ability to stick to a cancer cell  --  by tinkering with the underlying genetic code and selecting only the best of the new genes for the next round of improvement . <p> In farm fields and kennels , exploiting evolution is old hat . Farmers favor a corn crop that best survives summer , for instance , and with decades of patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pomeranians . But in the lab , evolving better proteins is a recent feat  --  and a faster one . By focusing their efforts at the genetic level , one molecule at a time , researchers can coax a protein toward perfection in just a matter of weeks . In the process , companies like Maxygen hope to crank out safer medications , more potent cleansers and healthier crops , lust a few years out of the gate , these young firms are already bringing new protein products to market , forging alliances with such giants as Dow Chemical , DuPont and Novartis and launching successful IPOs ( see " Evolving Industry , " p. 88 )  --  all evidence that " directed evolution " is really happening , not just in the test tube , but also in the marketplace . Evolutionary Alternative <p> Directed evolution is an alternative to " rational protein design " a technique that became popular in the 1980s . In rational protein design , researchers try to craft a new molecule  --  perhaps an antibody or an enzyme  --  by first studying an existing protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gene that encodes it . But that sort of painstaking methodology can prove to be difficult . Not only must researchers determine the sequence of amino acids  --  the 20 building blocks that make up all proteins  --  but they must also understand the complicated pattern of folding that the chain of amino acids undergoes to become a functional , three-dimensional molecule . Even after bringing sophisticated computer tools to bear on the problem , researchers say , it 's hard to unravel the workings of a protein folded up like origami , much less create a new one that behaves the way you want it to . " Rational design has failed miserably at helping us make useful proteins , " says Caltech 's Frances Arnold , a directed-evolution pioneer who sits on Maxygen 's scientific advisory board . <p> Frustrated with the limitations of rational design , a growing group of researchers are borrowing from nature 's tool kit instead , mimicking the basic processes of evolution  --  the generation of genetic diversity and the selection of desirable traits  --  to improve proteins , even without understanding their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . A team led by MIT chemical engineer Dane Wittrup , for example , evolved an antibody fragment to bind 10,000 times more tightly to its target in just four rounds of directed evolution . Researchers like Wittrup hope better-binding antibodies might someday be used to fight cancer : Attach a cell-killing agent to an antibody that binds specifically and tightly to molecules found only on cancer cells , the logic goes , and you can wipe out the cancer without damaging healthy tissues . And it 's not just antibodies but a wide range of potentially useful proteins  --  from industrial enzymes to protein pharmaceuticals  --  that stand to benefit . " With just a few evolutionary cycles , we can dramatically improve molecules that have frustrated companies for years " says Stemmer . Do the Shuffle <p> Stemmer invented his version of directed evolution , called " molecular breeding , " seven years ago , while working at Affymax , in Palo Alto , Calif . The brainchild of entrepreneur Alejandro Zaffaroni , Affymax was the first company to focus exclusively on discovering new drugs through combinatorial chemistry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molecules are randomly generated , and then the useful ones are fished out through clever screening . Extending the combinatorial idea into the realm of protein development , Stemmer struck upon the idea of shuffling DNA . The basic concept : Start with a few different versions of the gene for a protein you 'd like to improve , cut them up and mix the pieces together to generate a diverse pool of new versions of the gene , fish out the ones you like best , and start all over again ( see " Evolution , Maxygen Style , " above ) . In 1997 , Zaffaroni spun off Maxygen to take molecular breeding to market . <p> Larger companies , sniffing the commercial potential of evolution in a test tube , began hooking up with Maxygen . One of the first was the Danish firm Novo Nordisk , the largest industrial enzyme maker in the world , which had already been dabbling in directed evolution on its own . Reporting last year in the journal Nature Biotechnology , scientists from the two companies showed how directed evolution might churn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the structural gene for Savinase , a stain-eating enzyme developed by Novo Nordisk . Next they collected DNA for the naturally occurring version of the enzyme , subtilisin , from 25 different strains of Bacillus bacteria . With scissors-like enzymes , the team chopped up Savinase and wild subtilisin DNA , shuffling it together to create a new generation of unique " daughter " genes . Then the researchers inserted each gene into a bacterial cell . Finally , they exposed those cells to different temperatures and pHs to see how the resulting proteins held up . <p> The results were intriguing . While Savinase works best in a limited range of conditions  --  cool water and a fairly alkaline environment  --  some of the new proteins produced by the experiment worked four times better , and under acidic conditions . Many of the daughter molecules also performed better than their parents when heated or dunked in organic solvents . For 35 years , Stemmer notes , teams of industry scientists have tried to rationally design an improved subtilisin enzyme . " Within a year , three of our scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celebrate Diversity <p> And who could n't use a better molecule ? Analysts say the market for directed evolution stretches wide , including medicine and agriculture in addition to the chemicals industry . " This is no fad , " says David Molowa , a biotech analyst at Chase Manhattan in New York . " I think this technology is very real , and it 's already generating new products . " This list today includes a potential new catalyst for penicillin production , developed by Maxygen and now in commercial development at Dutch conglomerate DSM , and a fat-stain-removing enzyme from Novo Nordisk called Lipoprime , already on the market . <p> Indeed , the $2 billion industrial enzyme market is a logical niche for directed evolution , says Carolyn Fritz , global director of industrial biotechnology for Dow Chemical . Fewer than 30 enzymes generate more than 90 percent of industrial enzyme sales . That 's not for lack of trying on the part of the chemical companies to make new ones . The problem is that most enzymes fizzle under harsh , real-world conditions . Manufacturers could use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-cholesterol cooking oils and blue jeans . " We have a lot of different customers who could use better enzymes " Fritz says . <p> To bring those enzymes to life , Dow has partnered with another biotech firm , San Diego-based Diversa , which has a different take on directed evolution from Maxygen . Rather than starting with a few different versions of a gene and shuffling the DNA , Diversa researchers typically begin with one gene and then introduce a multitude of mutations . <p> This technique generates maximum diversity in the pool of new candidate proteins . Indeed , using a procedure called " gene-site saturation mutagenesis , " Diversa researchers can try each of the 20 possible amino acids in each position along the protein chain  --  in less than two weeks . " It 's a numbers game , " says Dan Robertson , head of enzyme technology at Diversa , a game the company hopes will yield hardier and more effective proteins . <p> Diversa researchers stack the odds in their favor by choosing unusual genes as starting points . The company has hired far-flung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bug from the Costa Rican jungle , an industrial dump site or the rotting skin of a submerged whale carcass . By harvesting DNA from bacteria on that dead whale , Diversa scientists collect the raw genes for enzymes that naturally break down polymers or fats in nasty environments . " If we need a high-temperature enzyme to work under an alkaline pH , we go looking for places that already have those kinds of conditions , " explains Diversa CEO Jay Short . " We discover enzymes that are optimal in those settings , and then we can use directed evolution to push favored traits even further . " <p> Short says Diversa hopes to spread its discoveries around , selling improved proteins for everything from animal feed to human medicine . " I think directed-evolution tools are going to be very important for evolving human therapeutics-increasing a drug 's binding affinity or its half-life , or lowering the dosages necessary for it to work , " Short says . <p> Diversa is n't the only evolutionary firm sizing up the $300 billion worldwide pharmaceuticals market . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of The Woodlands , Texas , is moving toward crafting antibiotics and drugs that fight cancer , says Peter Policastro , company president . San Diego 's Applied Molecular Evolution is packing an extra punch into existing drugs by changing their protein structures , evolving more powerful medicines . Currently , AME is partnering with Gaithersburg , Md 's MedImmune to churn out second-generation versions of several MedImmune drugs . <p> For now , Chase Manhattan 's Molowa says that directed-evolution firms will continue to sell themselves as technology-platform providers , partnering with industry giants that promise dollars and distribution . In addition to its deal with Novo Nordisk , Maxygen has forged collaborations with DuPont subsidiary Pioneer Hi-Bred , AstraZeneca and others  --  and has " proof-of-principle collaborations " with Abbott , Pfizer and Novartis under way . Diversa has joined forces not only with Dow , but with Novartis and Rhone-Poulenc , among others , as well . Eventually , Molowa adds , look for firms like Maxygen and Diversa to roll out their own products . White Potato , Red Potato <p> As in nature , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some researchers caution that the new technique has its limitations . " You 're not going to turn a potato into a broccoli , " says Arnold at Caltech . " Maybe you can turn a white potato into a red potato . The question is , what 's close , in terms of evolution ? We just do n't know yet . " <p> It 's a question lacking easy answers . At Maxygen , company president Simba Gill says DNA shuffling has worked in 90 percent of experiments  --  and the firm drops the experiments that fail . Duke University biochemist Homme Hellinga says he would like to see chemists combine aspects of rational protein design and directed evolution , using computers to model new proteins and then testing well they can adapt to different environments . <p> But even proteins that evolve beautifully in the lab face classic development hurdles , warns Arnold . When Arnold 's lab evolved a detergent enzyme for Procter and Gamble , the new enzyme passed lab tests with flying colors  --  only to fall apart inside company washing machines . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Arnold says . " You eventually have to try it . " In the same way , she adds , companies such as Diversa and Maxygen will have to prove that each of their evolved molecules works in the real world . <p> Yet another obstacle could crop up in an arena that is becoming central to almost all of high technology these days : intellectual property . Both Maxygen and Diversa have staked relatively broad patent claims , which some industry observers say might not survive litigation . And a patent issued to AME in 1998 , if broadly interpreted , might force some players in the field to seek licenses from AME in order to continue their projects . AME set up a licensing program this spring and has already successfully defended its patent against one challenge in Japan . Regardless of how the legal landscape shapes up , though , directed evolution seems certain to offer researchers in academia and industry alike a faster route to better proteins for years to come .
