A prophetic pope I GREATLY ENJOYED READING YOUR COMMEMORATIVE JUNE issue on Pope John Paul II . It seemed balanced , and the coverage was extensive . But I have to confess that in your issue , as well as in a great deal of other coverage I have been reading and watching , I have found relatively little about the pope 's consistent effort to inject Catholic social thought into public policy . In your publication I found attention to this aspect of his mission only in a couple of paragraphs of Kevin Clarke 's Margin Notes ( " What 's left in his legacy " ) . This seems unfortunate to me . More than almost any other public figure , John Paul II understood the meaning and dynamic of globalization , the accelerating and apparently inexorable domination of the world by the increasing concentration of market forces driven by the urge to maximize material gain . I believe John Paul II spoke truth to power . Power did n't always listen , rarely acted , and often repeated Pilate 's comment about truth . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice and peace did not always seem to blend with his rejection of Oscar Romero , his repression of liberation theology , and his embrace of Opus Dei . But he remains eminently quotable in support of global justice and in opposition to elements of the culture of death , like capital punishment and offensive war , which appeal to too many of our leaders and compatriots . I suspect that his legacy will take a while to sort out , but I hope that Pope Benedict XVI will try to continue those elements of his predecessor 's contribution that help to solve urgent and worsening world problems and also move the church into the future . Martin M. McLaughlin Arlington , Va . Do n't go changing We have been subscribers to U.S.CATHOLIC magazine for a number of years , as well as other Catholic and secular magazines . With the election of Pope Benedict XVI and his pronouncement of reaching out for unification , it was our hope that he would try to reunite our church first in the spirit of Cardinal Bernardin 's call for dialogue . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America to resign , it appears the pope is attempting to purge the church of anyone who does not think the way he thinks . I am truly disappointed and believe it is the " Reformation Part II " - only hopefully it will be bloodless . Please do not change your wonderfully open policy of expression , which we have enjoyed and admired over the years . Do n't turn the clock back to those guilt-ridden years . We try to remember that Jesus came for the sinner and not for the righteous . Larry and Pat Rose York Beach , Maine As a subscriber , I 've written in the past about my admiration for and enjoyment of your magazine . As bizarre as it felt , I sent an e-mail to Pope Benedict XVI when I heard about the removal of Father Thomas Reese , editor of America magazine . The sadness I felt at this move , which I saw as fear-based and punitive , impacted me very strongly . I just finished your June commemorative issue on the papacy . As usual , I was reminded how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My concern is that there maybe a tendency to " crack down " on liberal magazines . I do n't know how that would play out , but my prayer is that you do n't have to change or give up your work . May God guide all of us in the beginning of this new papacy . May we find a way to be united in the love we all feel for our church and our God , now and in the years ahead . Nancy Rocereto Haddonfield , NJ . Overworked , undernourished Thank you for the May cover story , " Time crunched : How busy schedules are sapping our spirit " by Thomas Billitteri . I was surprised , and also appreciative , to see that he talked about the partnership between the Seattle-based " Take Back Your Time " ( TBYT ) movement and the Massachusetts Council of Churches ' " Take Four Windows of Time " initiative , which TBYT endorsed . As the author pointed out so well , many Americans are caught in an epidemic of overwork , overscheduling , and time deprivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and join the growing number of people who are renewing their commitment to tend to their spiritual well-being and that of their families in whatever ways are appropriate to their religious tradition . As Billitteri noted , I received an astonishing number of unsolicited calls of gratitude from clergy and laity about our Labor Day-through-October 24 appeal to " Take Four Windows of Time . " We will be building on this initiative again in the fall of 2005 . Materials will be posted on our website ( **28;1123;TOOLONG ) this summer . Your readers are encouraged to use them in whatever ways are helpful . Jesus sometimes hopped in a boat and went away to a quiet place to be alone with God . We can too . Fundamentally this is a matter of good personal stewardship . Rev. Diane C. Kessler Executive Director Massachusetts Council of Churches Busy schedules are indeed sapping our spirit , as Billitteri discussed in his excellent article . Finding time for rest can seem impossible . Maybe we can only find a moment here and there . This can be a good start toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruct : " God is there in these moments of rest and can give us in a single instant exactly what we need . Then the rest of the day can take its course , under some effort and strain perhaps but in peace . " Jim Lein Minot , N.D. Surely Billitteri 's article should resonate with Americans of all faiths who are steadily losing their sabbaths and other time for spiritual life , family , friends , and health . I would quarrel with only one small note in an otherwise terrific piece . BiIlitteri mentions that because of high unemployment , French and German workers might trade places with their American counterparts . I find that most Europeans are proud of their shorter working hours . Moreover , their high unemployment rates are not the result of shorter worktime ; citizens of many other European countries , including the Netherlands and Sweden , also work far less than Americans do , yet their unemployment rates are equal to or lower than ours . We are sacrificing the things that really matter in life on the altar of overwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialogue about this crucial issue for Americans . John de Graff Seattle , Wash . Defending self-defense The May interview with Father John Dear ( " Disturbing for peace " ) is itself very disturbing because of the absurdity of the views that Dear is promoting . It is apparently Dear 's thesis that no war , not even one of self-defense , can be justified . Did he ever hear of St. Augustine 's requirements for a just war that are still the officiai guide in this matter for people of Christian faith ? If an individual has the right to defend himself or herself against an unjust aggressor so also does a nation . What would Dear have advocated that the United States do after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 ? The Judeo-Christian ethic does not in any way explicitly condemn all war as morally wrong . One of the heroes of the Old Testament is Joshua , who brought down the walls of Jericho . Jesus never condemned war or advocated radical pacifism . Does Dear condemn George Washington for waging the War of Independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union and abolish slavery ? It would seem that according to his own principles , he would have to . I , for one , have no sympathy whatsoever with Dear 's position that as Christians we must accept enslavement to evil rather than resist an unjust aggressor . James P. Ward Claymont , Del . In reading the May interview with Father John Dear , I sadly shook my head that someone of his intelligence could think that Jesus was a pacifist . Yes , by all means , be kind to others and strive for peace at all times ; but for goodness sake when you are attacked you have a right to defend yourself . I refuse to accept the proposition that if you are faced with a person bent on killing you , you are required to bare your chest to the attacker . Such an outlook reminds me of a scene in an old western . The outlaw was threatening to shoot this man holding a Bible and saying , " The meek will inherit the earth ! " With that the outlaw shot the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . " Joe Proctor New Albany , Ind . Photograph Sidebar " John Paul II spoke truth to power .
