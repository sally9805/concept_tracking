JIMMY LUNTZ had never been to war , but this was the sensation , he was sure of that-eighteen guys in a room , Rob , the director , sending them out-eighteen guys shoulder to shoulder , moving out on the orders of their leader to do what they 've been training day and night to do . Waiting silently in darkness behind the heavy curtain while on the other side of it the MC tells a stale joke , and then- " THE ALHAMBRA CALIFORNIA BEACHCOMBER CHORDSMEN ! " - and they were smiling at hot lights , doing their two numbers . <p> Luntz was one of four leads . On " Firefly " he thought they did pretty well . Their vowels matched , they went easy on the consonants , and Luntz knew he , at least , was lit up and smiling , with plenty of body language . On " If We Ca n't Be the Same Old Sweethearts " they caught the wave . Uniformity , resonance , expression of pathos , everything Rob had ever asked for . They 'd never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps , and into the convention center 's basement , where once again they arranged themselves in ranks , this time to pose for souvenir pictures . <p> " Even if we come in twentieth out of twenty , " Rob told them afterward , while they were changing out of their gear , the white tuxedos and checkered vests and checkered bow ties , " we 're really coming in twentieth out of a hundred , right ? Because remember , guys , one hundred outfits tried to get to this competition , and only twenty made it all the way here to Bakersfield . Do n't forget that . We 're out of a hundred , not twenty . Remember that , okay ? " You got a bit of an impression Rob did n't think they 'd done too well . <p> Almost noon . Luntz did n't bother changing into street clothes . He grabbed his gym bag , promised to meet the others back at the Best Value Inn , and hurried upstairs still wearing the getup . He felt the itch to make a bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded up in the pocket of his blinding white tux . They started running at twelve-thirty . Find a pay phone and give somebody a jingle . <p> On his way out through the lobby he saw they 'd already posted the judgments . The Alhambra Chordsmen ranked seventeenth out of twenty . But , come on , that was really seventeenth out of a hundred , right ? <p> All right-fine . They 'd tanked . But Luntz still had that lucky feeling . A shave , a haircut , a tuxedo . He was practically Monte Carlo . <p> He headed out through the big glass doors , and there 's old Gambol standing just outside the entrance . Checking the comings and goings . A tall , sad man in expensive slacks and shoes , camel-hair sports coat , one of those white straw hats that senior-citizen golfers wear . A very large head . <p> " So hey , " Gambol said , " you are in a barbershop chorus . " <p> " What are you doing here ? " <p> " I came here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Really . Believe it . " <p> " All the way to Bakersfield ? " <p> That lucky feeling . It had let him down before . <p> " I 'm parked over here , " Gambol said . <p> Gambol was driving a copper-colored Cadillac Brougham with soft white leather seats . " There 's a button on the side of the seat , " he said , " to adjust it how you want . " <p> " People will be missing me , " Luntz said . " I 've got a ride back down to LA . It 's all arranged . " <p> " Call somebody . " <p> " Good , sure-just find a pay phone , and I 'll hop out . " <p> Gambol handed him a cell phone . " Nobody 's hopping anywhere . " <p> Luntz patted his pockets , found his notebook , spread it on his knee , punched buttons with his thumb . He got Rob 's voice mail and said , " Hey , I 'm all set . I got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He thought a second . " This is Jimmy . " What else ? " Luntz . " What else ? Nothing . " Good deal . I 'll see you Tuesday . Practice is Tuesday , right ? Yeah . Tuesday . " <p> He handed back the phone , and Gambol put it in the pocket of his fancy Italian sports coat . <p> Luntz said , " Okay if I smoke ? " <p> " Sure . In your car . But not in my car . " <p> * * * <p> Gambol drove with one hand on the wheel and one long arm reaching into the back seat , going through Luntz 's gym bag . " What 's this ? " <p> " Protection . " <p> " From what ? Grizzly bears ? " He reached across Luntz 's lap and shoved it in the glove compartment . " That is one big gun . " <p> Luntz opened the compartment . <p> " Shut that thing , goddamn it . " <p> Luntz shut it . <p> " You want protection ? Pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I agree completely , " Luntz said , " and can I tell you about an uncle of mine ? I have an appointment to see him this afternoon . " <p> " A rich uncle . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
