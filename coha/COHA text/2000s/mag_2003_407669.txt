Birthdays are supposed to be fun for both parents and kids , but sometimes the pressure to come up with the perfect event can leave you more inclined to reach for painkillers than party hats . If you 're starting to panic because your child 's birthday is drawing closer and you still have n't pinned down " The Theme , " perhaps it 's time to call a quick time out . Why not resolve to plan a simpler celebration this year - something that 's less about flash and more about fun . Here are ten party ideas guaranteed to score big points with the kids without compromising your sanity or your bank balance . While all it takes is a little creativity to adapt these parties to different age groups , we 've started with themes for little kids , progressing to soirees for the more sophisticated tween crowd . 1 THE ULTIMATE POT PARTY Clay flowerpots , that is . You ca n't go wrong with painting inexpensive terra cotta pots - even preschoolers can slap on some bright colours with nice results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early on in the party . Then after cake and presents , when the paint is dry , fill the pots with goodies - perhaps a flower bulb and a few rocks and shells - and then wrap them with some Cellophane and a bit of ribbon . 2 MURAL MANIA You wo n't have much trouble keeping little kids entertained at a mural birthday party . Simply invest in a couple of rolls of heavy-duty kraft paper and masking tape . Cover the floor and the walls of your kitchen with the paper , then set the young artists loose with washable markers . Of course , if the weather happens to be nice , you can take your party outdoors - just tape the paper to the garage door or fence instead . 3 PLAYGROUND PARTY Kids spend so much time immersed in high-tech gadgetry that they sometimes miss out on good old playground games . Why not plan to teach them old favourites like hopscotch , four square and jacks by hosting a playground party ? Use chalk to draw the hopscotch and four-square games on your sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create the games indoors by using masking tape on carpet . When children tire of these , bring out other retro games like pick-up-sticks , Barrel of Monkeys , Twister and dominoes . 4 CARD PARTY No , not poker . We 're talking about a card-making party . Just make sure you have the basics on hand - blank cards with matching envelopes , rubber stamps , glitter , glue , markers , paints , tissue paper , dried flowers , clear contact paper and anything else that could be used to turn a blank card into a piece of art . And because each child will end up with a box of gorgeous , hand-decorated stationery , there 's no need to fuss over gift bags . 5 GARDEN PARTY If your little guy is n't into making pretty pots , get down and dirty planting something in them . This party works regardless of the season . In fact , an indoor garden party might be an even bigger hit because it 's so unexpected . Ask guests to leave the frilly party dresses at home and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or bulbs in the yard or create a mini-garden in a pot , chances are they 'll have a great time mucking about . The logical choice for dessert is mud pie ( chocolate ice cream in a crushed-cookie crust with a few gummy worms stuck in for added effect ) . Send guests home with a packet of sunflower seeds in their treat bag . 6 KEEP THEM IN STITCHES Aunt Mildred always predicted that knitting would be back in vogue . Looks like she was right . So if you 're searching for a one-of-a-kind party theme that 's very much on trend , knitting could be just the ticket . The loot bags are a cinch ( a pair of knitting needles wrapped in a pattern downloaded from a knitting company Web site ) . And you certainly wo n't have to look too far to find a volunteer to teach the old " knit one , purl two " moves to the next generation . Hey , looks like Aunt Mildred is pulling into the driveway right now .... 7 BOOKED ON SATURDAY NIGHT This idea works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read and who hangs out with an equally bookish crowd . You can plan an entire party around the theme . Design invitations to look like mini-books by including a few extra pages inside , and invite guests to help celebrate the next exciting chapter in the birthday girl 's life by coming dressed as their favourite literary character . A book-shaped birthday cake is easy for even the most culinarily challenged - using a plain rectangular cake , just ice the top and " spine " in a darker colour than the remaining three sides and squiggle a title ( " Emily 's Birthday Adventure " ) on the " cover . " Try board games based on popular literary characters like Madeline and Harry Potter , or quiz kids game-show style on characters and events in books they 'll all know . And as for what to put in the loot bags , what could be easier than a $5 gift certificate for the local bookstore ? 8 STARS IN THEIR EYES It can be tough to keep preteen boys entertained at a sleepover - unless , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit card renting truckloads of movies and video games . There is , however , an alternative : Why not host a backyard astronomy party ? While having access to a telescope or a pair of binoculars is a bonus , if you get a clear enough night , the troops should be able to spot the key constellations by simply gazing at the sky and referring to some charts . ( Download basic sky charts off the Internet or find a book in your local library . ) If you like , give each kid a photocopy of a chart , a mini-flashlight and some coloured markers to connect-the-dots on the constellations he finds . Of course , the success of this kind of gathering will depend on viewing conditions in your area as well as Mother Nature 's co-operation . Just in case it starts pouring buckets , you might want to have a bunch of kid-friendly astronomy flicks like Cosmic Voyage or Stargaze on hand . 9 MIDNIGHT MOVIE MARATHON A late-night movie fest is likely to appeal to kids who are always begging to stay up way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the VCR until midnight , so they 're pretty much guaranteed to be up until 2 a.m. ( unless , of course , some clever parent manages to trick them into picking a video with a soothing soundtrack that slowly lulls each child off to sleep ! ) . Of course , if your guests are a little younger , you might want to time things so that the VCR shuts off just as the clock strikes 12 . While they 're waiting for midnight to roll around , parry-goers can entertain themselves making pizza , testing their knowledge of movie trivia and popping popcorn. 10 HE SHOOTS , HE SCORES ! What could be more Cana- dian than a ball-hockey birthday party ? Just ask each party guest to tote along his hockey stick so that you can be sure you 've got enough to go around , and let them get to it on the street or in your driveway . Got a hoop and a budding Steve Nash ? Make basketball the sport of choice - or soccer , baseball , etc . You 'll find sports-themed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can easily transform a round cake into a hockey puck or any kind of ball . Score one for mom !
