Section : Money &; Business <p> It has become a staple of Sunday newspapers , television talk shows , and late-night news programs : the cautionary tale about the Internet turning America 's youth into a generation of socially inept zombies , plugged in but tuned out , incapable of any conversation longer than an instant message , and headed for a sedentary life of weight gain , eye strain , and information overload . <p> But if anyone is in danger from the growing power of the Internet and its transformative effect on communication , entertainment , information , and commerce , it is not America 's youth but the old media themselves . Companies such as the New York Times , Walt Disney , News Corp. , and NBC/Universal , as well as magazine and book publishers , are increasingly losing ground to a new breed of media elites who grew up in the digital world and are now out to control it by offering content and services to users worldwide . " These new entities have emerged with real businesses and real earnings , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly the landscape is shifting was demonstrated in the past two weeks . Google posted blowout profit numbers in the third quarter , with earnings rising sevenfold , handily beating estimates as its stock pushed the $400 mark . Rival Yahoo ! saw revenues rise 42 percent in the quarter . Microsoft , which increasingly sees online portals as its greatest threat , announced it would offer Web-based versions of its dominant Windows and Office software packages as it shifts more resources to the Internet . Even AOL , battered during the dot-com bust , has regained some luster , with a host of suitors from Yahoo ! to Microsoft to cable giant Comcast seeking a piece of the 110 million-viewer Web portal . Time Warner directors met last week to discuss the offers , as AOL cofounder Steve Case left the board to pursue his own healthcare ventures . Old media 's woes continue to mount , meanwhile . The largest shareholder in Knight Ridder , the nation 's No. 2 newspaper chain , called for the company to be broken up and sold partly because it can not capture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lynch analyst Lauren Rich Fine pointedly noted there might be a shortage of buyers , given the " secular challenges " facing traditional media houses . <p> Full speed ahead . It 's hard to remember that Google , Yahoo ! , and MSN were barely on the radar screen a decade ago . It was a dial-up world where only a small percentage of Internet users had high-speed access to the Web . Traditional media companies , with their film , television , and news operations , controlled the content universe and determined what was news , releasing information and entertainment products on a schedule of their choosing . Today , more than half of U.S. households have high-speed lines that allow them to easily access and download music and video from the Web onto an array of devices from laptop computers to cellphones to iPods . The average person now spends three hours a day on the Internet , and with the explosion of blogs and social-networking sites , where users provide free content , the line between consumers and providers has all but disappeared . <p> " Yahoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Allen Weiner of Gartner . " They will become the newspaper and radio station and TV station and also your communications provider . " <p> Competitor Google 's audacity appears boundless . The $36 billion company is plastering help-wanted signs all over the Net and even in newspapers . It is going ahead with a controversial plan to digitize the world 's top libraries on its site and is joining forces with NASA to research such topics as supercomputing , linking up with former rival Sun Microsystems to take on Microsoft , and testing an online classified-ad business that takes aim directly at eBay . <p> Yahoo ! , which pulls together content from a wealth of sources and whose 400 million unique monthly viewers make it the world 's most visited Web portal , is expected to post revenues of about $5.3 billion this year , up 47 percent over 2004 , with a fat profit margin in excess of 40 percent . " Yahoo ! is so hyperfocused on meeting the needs of its users , and it continues to innovate around them , " says Charlene Li @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , it 's not just about having the best content but having the best aggregation of the best content . " And now the portal is giving its own users more control over what goes onto its thousands of Web pages through an array of user-generated content sites such as blogs and social-networking sites , where photographs , product reviews , movie and music recommendations , political opinions , and other consumer information are posted on the site by users . It has even put a toe into producing original news and content , hiring TV journalist Kevin Sites to do online reporting from the world 's trouble spots and adding a bevy of personal finance columnists to its popular Yahoo ! Finance pages . <p> What the upstarts are doing is turning upside down the age-old relationship between the brokers of information and their audiences . Remember when Walter Cronkite was in everyone 's living room ending his CBS newscast with " And that 's the way it is " ? Now , " it is n't somebody else who programs you anymore , " Yahoo ! CEO Terry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The consumer is the programmer . All those folks who used to make those decisions for us , thank goodness they 're not in our lives anymore . " ( Cronkite , meanwhile , appears on an online blog . ) <p> Photo album . Hyperbole aside , Semel 's vision is playing out . During Hurricane Katrina , Yahoo ! ' s coverage offered traditional reports from the Associated Press , USA Today , ABC News , and other news outlets . But it also included hundreds of pictures posted by locals on Flickr , the amateur photo gallery Yahoo ! purchased in March , blogs from ordinary people reporting the scene in their backyards , home video , and even emergency contact information . " It was a comprehensive package of all forms of media , " says Morgan Stanley Internet analyst Mary Meeker . <p> The shifting tectonic plates have left executives of the old media  --  who a few decades ago controlled the news agenda from offices just blocks apart in midtown Manhattan  --  playing catch-up at a time when their stock values pale in comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When the bubble burst and the stock prices on all these new media companies tanked , they breathed a collective sigh of relief that they could go back to normal , " says Esther Dyson , editor at CNET Networks , which publishes Release 1.0 . " But they were totally mistaken , and now they 're finally waking up to what they 're losing . " <p> And that 's big bucks . Internet advertising is up by 26 percent this year to $14.7 billion ( out of total advertising of $278 billion ) and is expected to top $26 billion by 2010 , according to research by Forrester Research . Google alone sold $6.1 billion in ads this year , double that of last year and more than any newspaper chain , magazine group , or television network . By 2006 , its ad revenues are projected to top $9 billion , which would put it fourth among American media companies in total ad sales and ahead of such giants as NBC , Universal , and Time Warner . <p> Some of the graybeards have adopted the strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join ' em . " Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp . plunked down $1.3 billion earlier this year on acquisitions including MySpace.com , a fast-growing social-networking site , and IGN Entertainment , which publishes video games and other content . CBS owner Viacom tried to buy MySpace and IGN but ended up instead with Neopets , a website for children offering virtual pets . Disney recently announced a landmark deal with Apple to sell ABC ' s top-rated television shows Desperate Housewives and Lost in a digital format where they could be downloaded to a video iPod . The New York Times Co. bought About.com ( which features independent experts offering advice ) earlier this year for $418 million . Although its third-quarter revenue of $14.2 million was a small portion of the Times Co. ' s earnings , About 's ad revenues mushroomed by 67 percent  --  compared with just 2.9 percent for the Times Co. overall . <p> Online ads appeal to marketers because their effectiveness can be measured in a number of different ways . Advertisers can see exactly how many people click on the ads , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in some cases ) , and how often the ad converts a shopper to a buyer . " The virtuous circle , " says Yahoo ! Chief Operating Officer Dan Rosenzweig , " is that if the content is more relevant and the advertising is more relevant , the consumer will be happier and will keep coming back . " <p> TV offers nothing comparable , so advertisers rely on ratings information that is often subjective and less than reliable . " The Internet is the most ubiquitous experimental lab in history , built on two-way , real-time interactions with millions of consumers whose individual consumption patterns can for the first time be infinitesimally measured , monitored , and molded , " says Richard Yanowitch , a veteran Silicon Valley marketing consultant . <p> Get your clicks . The Internet is also helping to rewrite the very rules of advertising , where companies aimed ads at selected demographic groups they believed were most interested in buying their products . " Traditionally , the focus has been on the outbound message , " says Tim Armstrong , vice president of ad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming back in is as important or more important than the messages going out . For years , demographics has been a religion among advertisers because it was the only information they had . Now they 're realizing there 's more out there . " Google rationalizes that reaching 60 people who have actually shown interest in a particular product by visiting its marketing site or a related blog is much more effective than targeting 600 people who are in the right age , education , and income bracket to buy the product but have not indicated any special interest in it . And because most of Google 's ad-buying clients pay for ads only when users click on them , the company can precisely measure their effectiveness and charge more for ads that really work . <p> The question for the traditional media powerhouses , with their troves of content , is which role they want to assume : simple providers of content on whichever portal suits them , or portals unto themselves , offering search ( the biggest magnet for advertising right now ) , instant messaging , E-mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News Corp . is taking the portal approach and plans to add E-mail , search , and voice services to its Web offerings . Disney , burned from its Go.com portal venture , is now spreading its money around , investing in mobile phones , interactive television , and other advertising-supported websites . Steve Wadsworth , president of Walt Disney Internet Group , says the company has learned a lot since the Go.com days . " Just because something is cool does n't mean people will do it , " he says . " People do change their behavior , but it happens more slowly than you think and often in different ways than you expect . " The ability to download a movie over the Internet to your computer does n't necessarily mean you want to . But if you can download it onto Apple 's new video iPod , that may prove more appealing . In February , the company will launch Mobile ESPN , a cellphone service that gives users immediate access to real-time sports scores , news , columns , fantasy sports team management , and video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Disney . <p> Some of the hottest approaches to the Web , being embraced by new media and old alike , are sites like MySpace.com , Facebook.com ( story , Page 58 ) , and Flickr , where users create the content and the online community . The beauty of user-generated content is that it is free and almost limitless , and ads can be sold against it . MySpace , for instance , is adding 125,000 new , mostly teenage users each month , who spend an average of one hour and 40 minutes a month on the site , writing blogs , listening to music , and viewing each other 's home pages while browsing ads from the likes of Nike and other consumer brands . But free content alone was n't enough to justify News Corp . ' s spending more than $500 million for the site , and the entertainment giant , which owns Fox Broadcasting , has no illusions about how quickly cool can shift to cold . " The great thing about MySpace is what the users give each other . They 're the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of Fox Internet Media . " But we have to continually give them features and products and the ability to make it relevant , to make it work . We need to keep growing their engagement . " To that end , Fox plans to use MySpace as a giant focus group , testing its new fall TV pilots online or floating ideas from its hit teen shows American Idol and The OC and having MySpace users weigh in with their take . <p> Yahoo ! ' s research shows , for example , that even limited user reviews of movies , cars , consumer products , and travel experiences are surprisingly popular  --  and can draw ads . " A small number of users give reviews , but large numbers use those reviews , " says James Slavet , who runs Yahoo ! ' s auto and travel sites . " Expert views are really important . But other users ' opinions are another angle on making a decision . " <p> Ebert and Roeper , in other words , had better make way for Joe from Dayton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastest-growing sites , including Wikipedia and Instapundit . Yahoo ! now builds new services specifically to take advantage of its users ' proclivity to weigh in . A new product just rolled out , called Trip Planner , allows travelers to pull many Yahoo ! services , such as airline and hotel reservations , local maps , and sightseeing guides , into one document they can print out , like a mini travel guide . They can also go further and ask other users for tips . And once they 've traveled , users can create public blogs and slide shows of their trips for others to use . " A lot of the time , you do n't want a 600-page guide , " says Slavet . " You want 10 pages personalized to you . " <p> Blog it . Buying into the blogosphere is another way big media companies  --  old and new  --  can connect with their users . AOL recently paid a reported $25 million for Weblogs Inc. , a conglomeration of advertising-supported blogs covering everything from gadgets ( Engadget.com ) to autos ( Autoblog.com ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blogs are low cost , low production , and you can get in quickly , " says Jim Bankoff , executive vice president for programming and products at AOL . Blogs also give a big portal like AOL a way to divvy up its audience for advertisers into influential microcommunities . " If there are three people in the world you want to call up and ask what they think about a car , those people hang out on Autoblog , " says Bankoff . That said , once a media giant like AOL gets its grip on a blog , the blog loses its outlaw flavor , and its audience may be next . <p> In fact , it wo n't be long before all the new media are old enough that they start losing their rebelliousness and looking a lot more like their old-media predecessors , with thousands of employees , big bureaucracies , and heavy market pressures . " They 're going to start acting like their parents , " says analyst Vogel . " And inevitably they will disappoint people , have a down quarter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If history is any guide , that moment could occur anytime . It was only five years ago that the first round of Web frenzy came to a crashing end when many Internet stocks ( and the companies behind them ) lost all of their value . But there is a crucial difference now : The Internet leaders today actually are making money , gobs of it , with Google alone sitting on $7.6 billion in cash . That exceeds the current market value of Knight Ridder  --  what investors currently think the newspaper chain is worth  --  by a cool $3.5 billion . NEW MEDIA , OLD MONEY <p> As advertising shifts to the Web , the leading Internet sites are raking in the big bucks . TABLE <p> Source : Companies .
