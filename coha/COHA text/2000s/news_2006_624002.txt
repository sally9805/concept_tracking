<p> From the Sonoma wine country to the land of the Grapes of Wrath , from North Beach to the sands of the Southern California coast , some of the world 's best cyclists will get an unprecedented look at the Golden State in the Amgen Tour of California . <p> Starting Sunday in San Francisco , and for the next seven days , an international field of 128 riders , representing 16 different teams , will embark on a 596.2-mile journey up and down the California coast that constitutes the inaugural TOC . <p> " Everything 's in place and looking good , " race director Jim Birrell says . " The excitement in the pro peloton has been building for some time . It 's been a long time coming , and now it 's here . " <p> Also here now are a bunch of guys who would n't be out of place on the highways and byways of Europe , where the sport 's prime events are held . Riders such as Levi Leipheimer , the Santa Rosa resident and three-time top-10 finisher in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Floyd Landis of San Diego , another Tour de France contender who leads the Swiss Phonak team ; David Zabriskie of Denmark 's CSC squad , the one-time Berkeley resident who wore the Tour de France leader 's jersey for a few days last year ; Discovery Channel 's George Hincapie of South Carolina and Russian Viatcheslav Ekimov , long-time teammates and confidants of seven-time Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong ; Italians Gilberto Simoni ( of Spain 's Prodir-Saunier Duval team ) and Paolo Savoldelli ( Discovery Channel ) , past winners of the Giro d'Italia , and sometime Reno resident Bobby Julich ( CSC ) , the bronze medalist in the 2004 Olympic time trial . <p> " The magnitude of an event like this ... is huge , " says Sean Petty , chief of staff at USA Cycling , the sport 's governing body in the United States . " With the quality of the teams coming here , the Tour of California will be a showcase event for the sport of cycling . ... This will provide a platform for this sport like never before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California will raise the sport in the United States to a whole new level . " <p> The TOC , which will be shown nightly in a highlight package on ESPN2 , also will up the ante for a host of small , mostly domestic trade teams that rarely get such exposure . <p> " This race is super important for us , " says Robin Zellner , general manager of the San Francisco-based Kodakgallery.com/Sierra Nevada squad . " The Tour of California is one of the biggest races in the United States  --  this and ( the Tour de ) Georgia  --  and we 're racing against European teams . We will have to step up to it . " <p> The first step is Sunday 's prologue , a 1.9-mile " getting-to-know-you " race that starts at the Ferry Building in San Francisco and concludes at the base of Coit Tower on Telegraph Hill . The race wo n't be won or lost here ; it 's " mainly an opportunity for the race promoters to show off the 128 cyclists who are participating to the public , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 80.2-mile jaunt from Sausalito to Santa Rosa via the Marin and Sonoma county coast , is n't expected to shake out the peloton either . Because of the relative flatness of the route  --  the only real climbing is in the first few miles when the cyclists go over a shoulder of Mount Tamalpais  --  the winner  --  perhaps Emeryville 's Freddie Roriguez , who rides for the Belgian Davitamon-Lotto team , or Canadian Gord Fraser of Piedmont 's Health Net squad  --  most likely will come out of a bunch sprint in downtown Santa Rosa . <p> The second stage  --  Tuesday 's 94.9-mile ride from Martinez to San Jose  --  could be a key to overall victory . After the first 70 miles undulate through the East Bay hills , the course takes a decidedly steep climb to the heavens over Sierra Road , leaving little chance on the tricky , technical descent or the flat eight miles into downtown San Jose for any dropped cyclists to catch up with the leaders . <p> " The peloton will be so blown up by the climb , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Zellner says . " There wo n't be enough room to re-organize . " <p> And it 's this stage that small Bay Area teams such as Kodak/Sierra and Health Net can steal the big guys ' thunder . <p> " We know some things about these roads that the other teams do n't , " Zellner says . " The second stage is a very , very difficult one , and it will help to know the lay of the land . <p> Zellner likes the Stage 2 chances of his top gun , Ben Jacques-Maynes , who grew up in San Jose . " He knows those roads like the back of his hand , " Zellner says . " Plus , he 's riding really strong right now . " <p> If there 's any doubt after Tuesday 's ride about who will be TOC 's main men , the 17-mile individual time trial in south San Jose that constitutes the third stage surely will clear the air . The race of truth , as the time trials are often called , generally separates the contenders from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hammer away until it 's over . <p> " That 's the key stage for sure , " says Leipheimer , who likes Zabriskie 's chances the best in Wednesday 's race ( " If he does n't win it , I 'll be very surprised . " ) . <p> However , Zabriskie will be up against some powerful TT riders , including Ekimov and Julich , who finished 2-3 in the Olympic time trial ; Australian Michael Rogers , the three-time defending world TT champion who rides for the German T-Mobile squad ; Colorado 's Danny Pate ( Team TIAA-CREF ) , the 2001 world Under-23 TT champ , and Aussie Cadel Evans ( Davitamon-Lotto ) , who finished eighth overall at last year 's Tour de France . <p> With generally flattish terrain in stages 4 ( Monterey-San Luis Obispo , 130.9 miles ) , 5 ( SLO-Santa Barbara , 105.3 miles ) , 6 ( Santa Barbara-Thousand Oaks , 89.5 miles ) and 7 ( a 76.5-mile circuit race in Redondo Beach ) , there will be few opportunities to make up lost ground in the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter who is crowned the first-ever TOC champion , most people in the cycling community believe that the sport will be the real winner . <p> " I think everybody is excited about it , " Landis said in a recent interview with VeloNews . " It was n't hard to find people ( on his Phonak team ) to volunteer and go to the race . Who does n't want to go see California ? When the European guys get a chance to go ... to California , it 's not hard to find volunteers . " <p> Or as Zellner says : " The Tour of California is a showcase for the sport of cycling . It shows that the sport is alive and well in California .
