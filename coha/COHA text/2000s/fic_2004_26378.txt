My Weird School #1 : Miss Daisy Is Crazy ! Chapter One " My name is A.J. I like football and video games , and I hate school . " Our teacher , Miss Daisy , was taking attendance . It was the first day of second grade . Miss Daisy told everyone in the class to stand up , say our name , and say something about ourself . All the kids laughed when I said I hated school . But there was nothing funny about it . I have learned a lot in my eight years . One thing I learned is that there is no reason why kids should have to go to school . If you ask me , kids can learn all we need to learn by watching TV . You can learn important information like which breakfast cereal tastes best and what toys you should buy and which shampoo leaves your hair the shiniest . This is stuff that we 'll need to know when we grow up . School is just this dumb thing that grown-ups thought up so they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and have children of my own , I wo n't make them go to school . They can just ride their bikes and play football and video games all day . They 'll be happy , and they 'll think I 'm the greatest father in the world . But for now , I wanted to let my new teacher Miss Daisy know from the very start how I felt about school . " You know what , A.J. ? " Miss Daisy said , " I hate school too . " " You do ? " We all stared at Miss Daisy . I thought teachers loved school . If they did n't love school , why did they become teachers ? Why would they ever want to go to a school as a grown-up ? I know that when I 'm a grownup , I 'm not going to go anywhere near a school . " Sure I hate school , " Miss Daisy continued . " If I did n't have to be here teaching you , I could be home sitting on my comfortable couch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we all said . " What 's a bonbon ? " asked Ryan , a kid with black sneakers who was sitting next to me . " Bonbons are these wonderful chocolate treats , " Miss Daisy told us . " They 're about the size of a large acorn , and you can pop the whole thing right in your mouth so you do n't need a napkin . I could eat a whole box of bonbons in one sitting . " " They sound delicious ! " said Andrea Young , a girl with curly brown hair . She was sitting up real straight in the front of the class with her hands folded like they were attached to each other . Miss Daisy seemed like a pretty cool lady , for a teacher . Anybody who hated school and liked to sit around watching TV and eating chocolate treats was okay by me . Me and Miss Daisy had a lot in common . Maybe going to school would n't be so terrible after all . Miss Daisy said it was time for us to clear off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ugh ! " If I gave you fifty-eight apples and Principal Klutz took twenty-eight of them away , " Miss Daisy asked , " how many apples would you have left ? A.J. ? " " Who cares how many apples you would have left ? " I said . " I hate apples . If you ask me , you and Principal Klutz can take all the apples away and it would n't bother me one bit . " " You would have thirty apples , " said that girl Andrea Young in the front of the class . She had a big smile on her face , like she had just opened all her birthday presents . Andrea Young thinks she 's so smart . " I hate arithmetic , " I announced . " You know what ? " Miss Daisy said . " I hate arithmetic too ! " " You do ? " we all said . " Sure ! I do n't even know what you get if you multiply four times four . " " You do n't ? " " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and wrinkling up her forehead like she was trying to figure it out . " Maybe one of you kids can explain it to me ? " Boy , Miss Daisy was really dumb ! Even I know what you get when you multiply four times four . But that **35;97;TOOLONG Andrea Young beat me to it and got called on first . " If you put four crayons in a row , " she told Miss Daisy as she put a bunch of crayons on the top of her desk , " and you make four rows of four crayons , you 'll have sixteen crayons . See ? " Then she counted the crayons from one to sixteen . Miss Daisy looked at the crayons on Andrea 's desk . She had a puzzled look on her face . " I 'm not sure I understand , " she said . " Can somebody else explain it to me ? " Michael Robinson , this kid wearing a red T-shirt with a dirt bike on it , explained four times four again , using pencils . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four pencils . Miss Daisy still had a look on her face like she did n't understand . " What would happen if you subtracted half of the pencils ? " she asked . Michael took away two of the rows of pencils and put them in his pencil box . " Then you would have eight pencils ! " we all said . Andrea Young added , " Half of sixteen is eight . " Miss Daisy wrinkled up her forehead until it was almost like an accordion . She still did n't get it ! She started counting the pencils on Michael 's desk out loud and using her fingers . She got it all wrong . We all gathered around Michael 's desk and tried to explain to Miss Daisy how to add , subtract , multiply , and divide numbers using the pencils . Nothing worked . Miss Daisy had to be the dumbest teacher in the history of the world ! No matter how many times we tried to explain , she kept shaking her head . " I 'm sorry , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe you can explain it to me more tomorrow . For now we have to clean off our desks because Principal Klutz is going to come in and talk to us. "
