<p> From their sixth-floor apartment , in this thoroughly modern suburb of New Delhi , Gopal and Pranamita Sarma can see a bright future for themselves in India . <p> Sure , they see the grinding poverty and government corruption . They see the continued power of thuggish politicians and the relative weakness of the middle class . <p> But behind , they say , there is something bigger : a change in attitude . <p> The economy is growing at a rate paralleled only by China . Indian companies have become more sophisticated at making products that the world wants . And the Indian middle class has become more sophisticated as well , more willing to try new things and take new risks . <p> From their perspective , India is shining , and all the conditions are present to turn this once sleepy third-world country into an economic juggernaut . <p> " The last six months are the first time I have felt vindicated in not leaving India , " says Mr. Sarma , an economist and managing director for a consulting firm in New Delhi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US before graduate school , and I decided against it . All my family told me I was an idiot . But now , I feel this is a great place to be , and it 's only going to get better and better . " <p> For American taxpayers who see every job created in India as a job lost for them , this may not be welcome news . Gone are the days when India was a sinkhole for American aid dollars ; now it is a colossus ready to consume the world . In truth , India 's booming economy is still in its infancy , and not nearly as widespread or as popular as the statistics may indicate . <p> Here , many middle class and poor Indians complain that the boom has benefited a fortunate few and left ordinary Indians bearing the loss of 1.3 million jobs cut from the government bureaucracy over the past decade . Some of these cuts were made to satisfy international lenders and trade treaties . <p> The workforce frustration may be reflected in national elections , whose results will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative BJP coalition holding onto just enough power to rule a hung Parliament . In an ominous sign for the BJP , the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh , Chandrababu Naidu , conceded defeat to the Congress Party on Tuesday in state assembly elections . Mr. Naidu , a high-tech poster boy of the new Indian economy , and his party were a major part of the BJP 's governing alliance in the national Parliament . <p> Election Results <p> For the BJP , or Bharatiya Janata Party as it is called , it was not supposed to work this way . Early opinion polls , going into the election , portrayed a BJP that could n't lose . The economy was booming . Foreign exchange reserves - an indicator of foreign investment dollars coming in - were at an all time high . Even the Indian cricket team defeated their longtime rivals , Pakistan . Throwing millions into a glitzy television ad campaign called " India Shining , " the BJP called early elections and awaited the sweets and flowers . <p> Yet the undercurrent of discontent is unmistakable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining , and those are two different things altogether , " says Dipankar Gupta , a sociologist at Jawaharlal Nehru University . " People who have jobs are getting lots of money , but those who do n't have jobs , do n't . If you look at public hospitals , they 're a mess , the railways are a mess , the water is dangerous to drink . We have yet a lot to achieve . " <p> Indeed , even the signs of prosperity - call centers , computer software developers , and so on - have a feel of desperation . These positions number roughly 1 million , a small fraction of the India 's 400 million workforce . <p> At call centers it 's common to see hundreds of college graduates apply for a few dozen jobs . And while the private sector has begun to create jobs , mainly in major metropolitan areas , it has not been able to keep up with the 700,000 new job seekers entering the workforce each year . <p> " For five years , they have n't created one job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Prem Shankar Jha , a senior political analyst . " They have n't done a thing for the real people of this country . " <p> Mr. Jha points out that the BJP , bowing to middle class demands , have augmented consumer subsidies that divert government resources away from improving public services and infrastructure . " This is a response to organized middle class groups , and they get the larger benefit . " <p> Income Gap <p> But not all middle class Indians feel the benefit equally . In Bhopal , a lovely city with a tragic recent history of industrial pollution , one sees none of the jaldi-karo , or " speed it up , " enthusiasm and competitiveness of India 's high-tech or trading centers . The city remains a transit hub for food grains and cotton fabrics , but here middle class families like the Devgans of Green Park Colony have remained relatively untouched by the Indian " shining effect . " <p> Suresh Devgan , an electrical engineer who works for the municipal power company , often admits that he could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a power consultant or even designer for a computer firm . But he just ca n't bring himself to leave his post . " If everyone left their posts , then who would run the country ? " he tells relatives . <p> His wife , Chanchil , an elementary school teacher at a private Catholic school , says that she sees some Bhopal families spending more money and living a more lavish lifestyle , but most are still getting by and making do . Her salary , and that of her husband , has increased , but not at the same rate as inflation . The saving grace is that a decade ago , they purchased their current apartment in full , using Suresh 's mother 's jewelry as a down payment . Back then , rents cost 2,500 rupees , or $ 55 ; now they are 10 to 20 times that amount . <p> " If both parents are educated , if both parents are working , and if you are able to get job satisfaction , then definitely things are better now , " says Mrs. Devgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apartment her family shares with Suresh 's brother and his family . " But if you do n't have a support network , and are alone , then you get disgusted . " <p> As in the West , competition has filtered into children 's education . Every parent wants his child to succeed , says Mrs. Devgan , and will argue with teachers over grades . Sometimes they offer bribes even to raise a grade by one half percentage point . " Everybody thinks their child should be best , and the children grow up watching their parents , and thinking that money can buy everything . " <p> In the Family <p> Mrs. Devgan says that while the benefits of a boom economy are still filtering down to ordinary families , there has been a massive - and in Indian terms , quite sudden - cultural shift that she finds frustrating . <p> " When we were in school , we used to so easily follow what the teacher told us , " she says . " Now the children question the teacher . They really do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> It 's a phenomenon that troubles Gopal and Pranamita Sarma as well , one that they experience often among their neighbors in the lavish apartment complex , Ambience Island . <p> " Values have changed , both for better and for worse , " says Gopal . " A lot of people think there is an easy way through life . Children have learned from their fathers how to bribe . But it 's also true that a lot of people are willing to work harder than their parents did , and I think that 's good . " <p> His faith in India , ultimately , has to do with size and momentum . <p> " Between India and China , we generate more than 10 percent of the global economy , " says Gopal , who has master 's degree in economics . " We do n't need the United States ; it 's the US that needs us .
