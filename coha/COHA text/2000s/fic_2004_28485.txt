Chapter One Kit Davenport eyed the clock on the kitchen wall of the Dinner Belle Diner as she dumped handfuls of freshly chopped vegetables into the pot of stew meat already simmering on the six-burner stove . It was almost ten-thirty , and her part-time waitress , Bonnie Lennox , was n't scheduled to start work until eleven . Normally Bonnie came in when the diner opened its doors for breakfast at seven in the morning , but that day her young daughter was graduating from kindergarten , an event Kit had n't wanted her to miss . Unfortunately , the diner 's crusty old cook , George Ortiz , had called to say he , too , would be late that day due to a painful flare-up of the arthritis that occasionally crippled his gnarled hands and creaky knees but never his indomitable spirit . Handling the Dinner Belle single-handedly was n't a new experience for Kit . Since her mother , Dolores , had owned and operated the little diner in the small town of Belle , Montana , until her death this past December , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tourist season , with nearby Glacier National Park 's Logan 's Pass not yet open to vehicular traffic , the breakfast crowd , made up mostly of locals she knew on a first-name basis , had also been relatively undemanding . Kit had been able to take orders , fry eggs , flip pancakes , bus tables and wash dishes without a problem . But getting a head start on the lunch specials she and George had agreed upon for that Tuesday afternoon had been a bit of a challenge . Following even the simplest of her mother 's recipes involved a lot more time and mental energy than she had to spare , especially when she also had to keep an eye on her two-year-old godson , Nathan Kane . Though easily entertained by the constant activity going on all around him , as the morning wore on the little boy had been growing more and more unhappy with his confinement in the playpen she had set up for him in a corner by the counter . Taking a peek at the pans of lasagna , a Dinner Belle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mental note to start defrosting the loaves of garlic bread still in the freezer . But first she had another breakfast plate to serve up . She slid the eggs out of the cast-iron skillet , added several rashers of bacon , a scoop of hash-brown potatoes and two freshly baked biscuits , then made a beeline for the kitchen doorway . " Just a little longer , sweet boy , " she cooed to Nathan , shooting a smile his way as she hurried past the playpen . He called after her in his own special brand of gibberish , his high , young voice more aggrieved than it had been the last time she 'd walked through the kitchen doorway . He also waved his favorite stuffed teddy bear at her in an attempt to draw her attention to him rather than her customers . She did n't dare stop to acknowledge the gesture , though . That would only cause his fussiness to escalate another notch . " He 's such a good child , " Winifred Averill commented as Kit set the plate on the elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that Lucy Kane always was a wild thing . Lucky for her she had you for a friend . Otherwise there 's no telling what might have happened to that little boy . " " Yes , ma'am , Nathan is a good child , " Kit agreed , trying not to bristle at Winifred 's judgmental tone . She was well into her eighties , had lived her entire life in the small town of Belle and had n't ever had a shy bone in her body . Her tendency toward plainspokenness could often be unsettling , but she had never been intentionally malicious . " And I was the lucky one to have had Lucy for my friend . She brightened my life with her fun-loving ways , and she truly cared about Nathan . I was honored when she asked me to be his godmother and named me as his guardian in her will . " " Hard to believe how his daddy 's shirked all responsibility , and him coming from such a fine family , not to mention seeming like such a fine young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , " Kit replied . " Too bad he ca n't grow up here in Belle . But you were never as happy in this little town as your momma , or his momma , for that matter . Always had a yen for the big city , did n't you , Miss Kit ? " " Yes , ma'am . " " You were dead set on going away to college and you found a way to do it . Won a scholarship , got your undergraduate degree , then started working on a master 's degree , your momma said . Majoring in psychology so you could listen to folks talk about their problems . Just like your momma did here at the Dinner Belle , and she did n't need any fancy college degree to give good advice . " Chuckling softly , Winifred Averill stirred her eggs into her potatoes , adding , " I sure am going to miss this place when you close up at the end of the summer . " " I 'm hoping to have a buyer before then so closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've already had a few inquiries , " Kit said . Two , to be exact , and neither couple had pursued their interest in the diner beyond an initial inquiry . But she was n't about to set Mrs. Averill off again by admitting as much aloud . Kit did n't want to have to close the Dinner Belle for good . But neither did she want to give up the life she 'd made for herself in Seattle to run a diner in a small Montana town for the rest of her God-given days . She had gladly taken a leave from her graduate studies at the University of Washington to help out at home when her mother first became ill , and she had stayed on after her mother 's death for the sole purpose of keeping the diner going until it could be sold . Then Lucy had been killed in a tragic accident on an icy back road , and suddenly Kit had also had a precious little boy to raise all on her own . " Couple of years ago I would have bought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverie . " But I do n't have as much energy now as I did when I was eighty-five . " " That 's understandable , ma'am . " Kit hid a smile as she met the woman 's gaze . " Would you like more coffee ? " " Just a smidgen to warm up my cup , if it is n't too much trouble . " " No trouble at all . " As Kit turned to get the coffeepot from the warmer behind the counter , the tinkle of the little bell on the diner 's front door announced the arrival of another customer . Likely just another local , she thought , eager to refill Mrs. Averill 's coffee cup and get back to the kitchen . She had n't gone very far when the murmur of voices among the other customers sitting in the diner stilled , and into the silence Winifred Averill 's voice rang out , loud and clear . " Well , well , well ... speak of the devil , " she said , sounding not only amazed , but also quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been caught so completely , not to mention what had prompted Winifred 's comment , Kit glanced over her shoulder , checking out the newcomer as he closed the door , then paused a long moment to survey the friendly faces turned his way .
