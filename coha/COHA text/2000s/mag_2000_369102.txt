From highbrow art to mass-market gewgaws , transparency  --  a visual trend popularized earlier by Apple 's coveted iMacs  --  was the year 's clear ( ahem ) buzz word . Some of the year 's top buildings played with teasing , gauzy see-through effects , and you could scarcely buy consumer goods not skinned in Technicolor plastic : the Handspring Visor personal digital assistant , the Power Mac G4 Cube , translucent trash cans and toilet-brush holders from the likes of Ikea and Target . And magazines and books were rife with die-cut covers . The luminous transparent things of 2000 thrummed with Jell-O-colored energy , as if so jazzed they could hardly contain their insides . Now you see it . And you do n't . <P> 1 THE ROSE CENTER FOR EARTH AND SPACE The new planetarium addition to New York City 's Museum of Natural History is a 21st century update of an 18th century dream . Architect James Stewart Polshek 's simple design , a metal sphere set in a mostly glass cube , is a homage to the unbuilt ball that Etienne-Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newton . It tells of the grandeur of the universe itself , speaking in the language of both classic modernism and very high tech . <P> 2 HET OOSTEN PAVILION As the clouds pass over Amsterdam , colors shimmer and shift subtly on the surface of architect Steven Holl 's magnificent yet playful cube . This riverside structure , built for a Dutch corporation , looks less as if it was made from glass and perforated metal than from the surrounding water and light . <P> 3 THE TATE MODERN An ingenious appropriation took a former London power station and cranked up its wattage . The design team , led by Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron , has provided natural illumination for 20th century classics and warehouse-scale space for contemporary artists . <P> 4 THE OKLAHOMA CITY NATIONAL MEMORIAL The Butzer Design Partnership honored the 168 people killed in the 1995 bombing with a pavilion containing bronze and glass chairs  --  one for each victim  --  that recall the innocent dead while offering figurative comfort to the living . <P> 5 PS1 'S TEMPORARY DUNESCAPE OUTDOOR SUMMER PAVILION Architect firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N.Y. , became an inviting summer sensation . Made from 6,000 2-in. by 2-in. boards that rolled , twisted and slid about , it offered wet and dry places for visitors to bask , wade and escape the sun . It was an architectural drawing come to life . <P> 6 HEADBLADE A fashionably shaved head is either the ultimate in minimalist dandyism or the 21st century version of the comb-over . HeadBlade 's power razor has a form as curvy and clean as Patrick Stewart 's pate . Nestle it in your palm and " comb " yourself bald . It 's shear elegance . <P> 7 LIFE STYLE Design guru Bruce Mau argues passionately that form is inextricable from message . Nowhere is that truer than in his 624-page book , part portfolio , part manifesto , urging readers to become alert to the meanings transmitted in " the global image economy . " <P> 8 DUCATI SPORTS BIKE MH900e Like a futurist painting , this sensuously sleek Italian motorbike , designed in honor of champion racer Mike Hailwood , seems to move while standing still . And did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Day , it sold out its first year 's entire production at the Ducati website in 31 minutes flat .
