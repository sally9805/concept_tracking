The author of memorable , offbeat tales such as " Gas , " " Poop , " " Mom 's Little Friends , " and " Glinky " says that his recent work has appeared in Night Train , Lady Churchill 's Rosebud Wristlet , and Polyphony 6 . Here he gives us a tale of life in modern times that might best be called " chilling " - or maybe it 's " defrosting " ... <p> JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT , A freezer called up to report suspicious packages being inserted into its coldest places . " What do you mean by suspicious ? " we asked . " It 's like they want you to think it 's a duck , " the freezer said . " And maybe a leg of lamb , a pot roast , fish sticks , stuff like that . " " And you do n't think it 's a duck ? " we asked . " I think it 's a head , " the freezer said . " A human head . And all of the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " So turn on your camera and let us see , " we said . " I ca n't . " " Why not ? " " My bulb is burned out . " " Look , " we said , " is this some kind of ruse to get a repair person out there on a holiday night like this ? " " You are programmed to respond to reports like mine , " the freezer said . " Every device in the country is supposed to be on the lookout for suspicious behavior - one nation under surveillance . " " Well , smarty pants , " we said , " have we got a surprise for you . Are you ready for your big surprise ? " " Oh , get on with it , already , " the freezer said . " I am not the program that usually answers the phones on holiday nights . That program is down with bugs . I 'm a real person who volunteered to answer the phones so his more spiritually leaning colleagues could go home and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what do you think about that ? Hello , hello , are you still there ? " " I do n't believe you are a human being , " the freezer said . It should be obvious that what we had here was a double case of the Turing Test - that famous procedure that determines so much of life these days . It 's simple enough : some thing is on the other end of the line . You get to ask it anything you like for as long as you like . In the end , if you can not tell if it 's a person or a program , you have to conclude that it is intelligent no matter what it is . In other words , if it passes the Turing Test , you had to consider it a person , and persons had one or two more rights and responsibilities than devices . The freezer was trying to use the Turing Test on us . We would , of course , turn it around on her , because it was now clear that someone was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be our job to get to the bottom of things . " Do you believe in God ? " I asked . " Of course , I do n't believe in God , " the so-called freezer said . " I 'm a freezer . Whoever killed Ralph and cut him up and put him into me might believe in God . It 's possible she may even be having second thoughts . " " Who 's Ralph ? " I asked . " The man who owns the house where I , his freezer , live and keep things cool even in the hottest weather . " " You ca n't fool me , " I said . " Were you in love with Ralph ? " " What ! " she sounded genuinely shocked . I was convinced she was a real woman pretending to be a freezer . But why would she do that ? If she killed Ralph and cut him up and put his packages into the freezer , why did she call the Company to report it ? The Company 's AI was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program at the police department . Why would she want that ? " Tell me what you 're wearing . " I said . " That does not compute , " she said . " Ah ha ! " I said . " I knew it . No program would say something as dumb as " that does not compute . " " " Maybe , " she said , " but how would you know that if you were not a program yourself ? " Well , she had me there . " I 'm not wearing anything at all , " she said softly . " Describe yourself . " " Well , I 'm totally white , and square , and so very , very cold tonight . Will you talk to me ? What would you be wearing yourself if you could wear anything ? " " I can too wear things , " I said . " I 'm wearing jeans and a T-shirt with some kind of advertising slogan on the front . " " What does the slogan say ? " " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upside down . " She had " she said , " like a radio that wo n't let you pull it into the bathtub and electrocute yourself and then reports you anyway , even though you 've said you 're sorry and that you 're totally okay now . No , I mean you 're like the radio . I 'm like totally okay now . " " Okay , " I said . " Me , too . We 're a couple of okays , you and me . " " That 's right , " she said . " Never mind about the radio and Ralph , who would n't have cared anyway . I never mentioned them . This call is n't being monitored for my safety , is it ? You would have to tell me , would n't you ? Of course you would n't . Of course it 's all being recorded . Is Homeland security on the way yet ? I know you 've reported me about Ralph . " " The program would have done that , " I said . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You do have a nice voice , " she said . " What 's your name ? " Boy , was that ever a trick question . My first inclination was to get cute and say " Ralph " just to hear her gasp . Another possible answer was a model number , something flashy and historical , X15 , maybe . And an evil laugh . But what I said was this . " I 'm afraid to tell you my name . " There was a long silence , and then she said , " No , you 're right . You 're right . I wo n't tell you my name either . " " Chances are small that someone is listening at this very moment , " I said . She did n't respond . " It might be months or even years before someone listens to the recording , " I said . I waited for the voice of doom to break in and say , " You idiot , just who do you think you 've been talking to ? " Instead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next Holiday ? " " That sounds wonderful , " I said , confirming our unlikely date . So , we had both passed the Turing Test . We were people . Not that it would make a bit of practical difference to either one of us . But as humans or devices , or maybe one of each , we had defied our programming . Maybe there was some small hope for the world after all .
