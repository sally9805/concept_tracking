<p> When she was just 5 years old , Alysha Antonino knew she wanted to become a singer like her idol , Celine Dion . <p> Alysha even made up her mind that just like Dion , she would one day work with famed record producer-songwriter David Foster . <p> Now , the 12-year-old Scotts Valley ( Santa Cruz County ) girl is seeing her dreams come true , thanks to a new Web startup called Tonos.com , which has the backing of Foster and other top recording industry heavyweights . <p> Alysha won a singing contest sponsored by the Web site , which flew her to Hollywood for a recording session with Foster . During the session , Foster phoned Dion and let her listen to Alysha sing . <p> " She said something like , You 've got a beautiful voice and you 're working with the best , ' " Alysha said , still giddy about the encounter weeks later .
