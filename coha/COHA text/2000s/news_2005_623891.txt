<p> High gasoline prices do n't necessarily make service station operators rich . Ask Ricardo Tan . <p> Last year , not even record prices at the pump could save his Berkeley gas station business . <p> The problem was n't his location . His Shell station bordered University Avenue , thick with cars heading to and from the nearby freeway . <p> But oil giant Shell , which owns the facility , was drastically raising Tan 's rent . <p> The $2,000 per month he paid in the late 1990s had gone to $7,900 in 2001 , then $8,600 the following year , he said . Now , the company wanted $11,710 . And that did n't include other monthly fees he was obliged to pay for credit card processing and station maintenance . <p> Tan decided he could n't make a profit . He walked away from the station , turning it back over to Shell . <p> " With a gas station , everyone 's fighting for every nickel and dime , " said Tan , 48 . " It 's not necessarily a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil industry bonanza of 2005 is passing them by . Their parent corporations have posted record profits  --  $9.9 billion during the three months that ended in September in Exxon Mobil 's case  --  from prices that briefly topped $70 for a barrel of crude and $3 for a gallon of gas . <p> Angry motorists , convinced they 're being gouged , often blame the face behind the service station counter . <p> But ask dealers about their profit margins , and some insist they 're making 2 cents or less per gallon . They may even be losing money selling gas . <p> To understand why , you have to peer into the murky mechanics of street-level gasoline pricing . Dealers compete against each other while paying a host of fees to their parent companies . Government demands its own cut , through taxes and permit fees . <p> And all of these affect the price you pay at the pump . <p> First , understand that not all stations operate the same way . Some sell gasoline for the oil industry 's big brands , such as BP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what amounts to generic gas . <p> Even among the brand-name stations , there are important differences . Many stations are run by dealers who essentially act as franchisees , leasing their facilities from the company and setting their own retail prices . Others are run directly by the companies with a manager who oversees several stations . <p> The large oil companies can set prices as high or low as they want at the stations they directly control . But they ca n't dictate retail prices to the franchisees . As far as the oil companies are concerned , those dealers are free to run their businesses as they choose . <p> " Shell operators are independent businesspeople who make their own operating decisions and have the right to set gasoline prices as they believe appropriate , " Shell spokeswoman Karyn Leonardi-Cattolica said . <p> But those dealers do n't have complete freedom . Fees and requirements imposed by their parent companies greatly influence the prices they charge . <p> " The law says ( oil companies ) ca n't tell us how to price , and they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco . " But they 'll price wholesale in ways to force you up and down . " <p> Dealers at big-brand stations , for example , typically must buy their gasoline from the company they represent , even if they could find less-expensive gas elsewhere . <p> And the amount each oil company charges dealers for wholesale gasoline varies from one location to another , in a system called " zone pricing . " A dealer in San Francisco 's Marina district might not pay the same price , for the same gas , as a Mission District dealer working for the same firm . Dealers resent that . <p> " Zone pricing is nothing less than redlining in the insurance industry , " said Dennis DeCota , executive director of the California Service Station and Automotive Repair Association . <p> Dealers also typically pay a monthly fee , determined by their company , for processing credit card transactions . They pay another for maintenance on the station 's equipment , sometimes whether they need repairs or not . <p> Then there 's rent . <p> Tan 's experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices soared throughout California during the past five years , many oil companies ratcheted up rental fees to levels the dealers say they can barely afford . The companies say the higher rents merely reflect the market . <p> " The current rent structure is based on the appraised value of the real estate , improvements and equipment using standard commercial real estate techniques , " Leonardi-Cattolica said . " To the extent that rents went up , it was to bring them in line with the rest of the market . " <p> Dealers argue that if rents are pegged to a property 's market value , expensive cities such as San Francisco will lose their gas stations . <p> " You could never have a gas station there , " DeCota said . " You could make so much more if there were a skyscraper there . " <p> Subtract all of a station 's monthly fees and payments from the retail price of gasoline , and there 's little , if anything , left . <p> For example , take the monthly costs of one Bay Area dealer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The dealer charges $2.499 for a gallon of regular . Of that , 13 cents go to his rent , property taxes and monthly maintenance fee , combined . Credit card processing fees eat up more than 5 cents per gallon . Other taxes  --  including federal , state and sales  --  consume a little more than 57 cents . And he pays his brand-name oil company about $1.83 for each gallon of wholesale gasoline . <p> The result  --  he 's losing about 8 cents on every gallon of regular . And that 's before he factors in his payroll , his workers ' compensation insurance and the other myriad costs that go into running a small business . <p> Other local dealers , who also requested anonymity , reported similar costs , although the wholesale gasoline price varied by as much as 11 cents . Those losing money on gas have to find some other way to turn a profit , such as washing cars or selling Slurpees . <p> To some dealers , the high costs imposed by the oil companies look like an attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company-run stations . Doing so , they say , would give the oil companies more control over street-level pricing . <p> " You would think if they owned everything , they could control the price the way they want it , and that 's what they do n't have right now , " Currie said . " The companies are just kicking our butt , and they can do it . " <p> A spokesman for San Ramon 's Chevron Corp. , which makes the brand Currie sells , said the number of Chevron-owned stations has actually decreased in recent years , as a result of investment decisions . <p> A group of California Shell dealers has even taken their company to court , alleging that Shell is trying to destroy their businesses . The suit , which includes about 35 dealers , argues that Shell is using its company-run stations to undercut the franchisees , with the company stations paying lower wholesale gas costs through zone pricing . <p> Shell 's Leonardi-Cattolica declined to discuss the company 's fees or comment on the lawsuit in detail . <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete in today 's marketplace , but this is no evidence that Shell has acted improperly , " she said . <p> She noted that similar suits against Shell have failed in the past . <p> One , however , succeeded . A Boston jury last year found that Shell used unfair tactics against some of its Massachusetts dealers . That decision has been appealed . <p> Tan has joined the California suit against Shell . Company spokeswoman Leonardi-Cattolica declined to comment directly on his situation . <p> Tan has also gone back into the business , buying a Chevron station in Berkeley . His new company , he said , has treated him well , even though profits still are n't high . <p> " I 've got friends who come here from the Philippines and say , ' You must be a millionaire , ' " Tan said . " You do n't make much money from gasoline .
