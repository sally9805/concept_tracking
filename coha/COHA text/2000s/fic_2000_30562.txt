Chapter One Boston , February 1775 At dawn , North Square was seething with activity . Women with baskets stood amid the flimsy stalls of the marketplace , haggling with farmers or their agents over the high prices . Their voices mingled with the crowing of live turkeys for sale , the beckoning calls of merchants , and the rattle of carts that rolled through the square carrying precious firewood , apples , and onions from the country . Preoccupied with their own business , no one noticed the man who stood in the doorway of an inn on the edge of the square . Perhaps it was because the winter morning was bleak , and his long black hair and black cloak blended into the dark shadows of the doorway . Or perhaps it was because he stood utterly motionless , little more than a shadow himself . His position commanded an excellent view of the square , and in the dim light of early morning , his gray eyes restlessly scanned the area . He was looking for one man , and that man would tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ethan Harding 's acquaintances would have been astonished to see him skulking about in doorways in the wee small hours of the morning , since it was common knowledge that he never rose before noon . But then , they would not see him here , for they were fast asleep in their beds themselves , and it was unlikely they would have recognized him in any case . The dark clothing he wore was so unlike his customary wardrobe of colorful silks and lace , and his hair was not concealed by a powdered wig . The wealthy dandy of the Tory drawing rooms was completely unrecognizable in the serious man swathed in black who stood in the doorway of asecond-rate inn on North Square . And that suited Ethan perfectly well . A fishmonger 's cart rolled into his line of vision and came to a stop . Ethan let out his breath in a slow sigh of relief at the sight of the driver , a big , bald Scotsman who jumped down from the cart , crying , " Fresh clams today ! Fresh clams ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers . Ethan smiled to himself , knowing perfectly well that Samuel Adams did n't mind if his fiery prose smelled of cod or haddock , as long as the public was kept informed of every single transgression committed by the British government . Ethan started toward Colin , but matrons and housekeepers eager for fresh clams swarmed around the cart , and he stepped back into the shadows , waiting for the women to depart . While he waited , he continued to observe his surroundings , a habit gained from long experience . The baker , Matthew Hobbs , had a stall beside Colin 's cart and seemed to be doing a brisk business . A pity , since the man was a staunch Tory . Ah , well , not everyone wanted liberty from England . What they did n't realize was that it was inevitable . A young woman of perhaps nineteen or twenty paused beside the baker 's stall , less than a dozen feet from Ethan 's place in the shadows . Her clothes were rags , too tattered to make her the servant of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston winter , she wore no hat . Her hair , the golden brown color of honey , was cropped short , and Ethan guessed she had probably sold the rest of it to buy food or lodgings . She stood in profile to him , and although the long cloak she wore hid the lines of her body , Ethan could see hunger in the hollow of her cheek and the line of her throat . She was clearly a beggar , a common street waif a man would seldom notice , unless it was with a wary eye and a hand on his purse . But when she turned his way , Ethan drew a deep breath of surprise and revised his opinion . There was nothing common about this girl . She had the face of an angel . Ethan was not a man to be impressed by a woman 's beauty . In truth , he seldom noticed women at all these days , which he considered rather a shame when he took the time to think of it . There had been a point in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but suspicion was his only mistress now , and he knew all too well that treachery could hide easily behind a woman 's charms . Ten years as a spy had taught him that . Nonetheless , he could not help staring . Her wide eyes were the azure blue of a summer sky , with all the innocence of a child . Yet her thick , dark lashes and soft , generous lips had all the seductiveness of a courtesan . Her features were delicate , her flawless skin the color of cream . But it was her smile that fascinated Ethan . It was a smile that could make a man abandon his ideals , forget his honor , sell his soul . It was a smile that enslaved . It was magic . He wondered what had brought that smile to her lips , but from this vantage point , he could not tell . She returned her attention to the baker , who , like Colin , was preoccupied with a crowd of customers . Because he was observing her so closely , Ethan did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two meat pies that slipped from the baker 's table into the folds of her cloak . Well done , he approved , watching in amusement . Anyone who stole from a Tory deserved high praise indeed . She moved out of Ethan 's line of vision , and he leaned forward so that he could continue to watch her , but she disappeared into the crowd . He leaned back in the comfortable shadows of the doorway to wait for Colin to be free of customers . Even though the two men would speak in seemingly trivial terms , Ethan did not want to run the risk of having anyone overhear their conversation . It was always best to be cautious . A boy of about twelve stood near Ethan 's doorway selling newspapers . Tory newspapers , no doubt , since it was almost impossible for a boy to sell Whig newspapers in the marketplace these days . The soldiers harassed the Whig newspaper sellers so mercilessly that such an occupation was hazardous for a boy . Ethan set his jaw grimly . Soon , boys would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without fear of reprisal from the bored and unruly troops of a tyrannical king . A man paused beside the boy to buy a newspaper , a man who was obviously wealthy . His shoe buckles were cast of silver , his cane was made of gold and ivory , and his wig was of the finest quality . Ethan could not see his face , but the fashionable cut of his clothes , the vivid peacock-blue color of his coat , and the lavish lace at his cuffs proclaimed him an even more dandified Tory than Ethan pretended to be . " Thief ! Thief ! " The sudden cry rose above the noise of the crowd , and Ethan once again leaned forward in the doorway , curious to see what was going on . To his surprise , he saw the angel girl again , but this time , she was in the grip of a prosperous merchant . " I am no thief ! " she said indignantly , trying to wrench her wrist free of her captor 's grasp . " Unhand me ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Keeping a firm hold on her wrist , the man looked around for a constable . Ethan watched as she shoved and struggled against her captor , and he caught the glint of silver as she slipped the man 's watch into his pocket . Clever girl . Ethan grinned , knowing no one would be able to prove theft against her now . Unaware that his property had been returned , the merchant continued to shout for a constable , but the only person who came to assist was a young redcoat officer . " What is going on here ? " he demanded as he stepped forward out of the gathering crowd . " This girl stole my watch , " the merchant accused , twisting the girl 's wrist with enough force to make her cry out . " I did not ! It 's a lie ! " She looked up at the officer , her gorgeous eyes wide and pleading . She lifted her free hand in a helpless gesture . " A ghastly mistake has been made , " she said in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks I have stolen something from him , and I am unable to convince him of my innocence . Oh , Major , you seem such an able and intelligent gentleman . Please help me . " The officer , who was only a lieutenant , puffed up like an arrogant peacock at her flattery . He smiled and patted her arm . " I 'm sure everything will be fine , " he said soothingly , and turned to the merchant . " When did you lose your watch , sir ? " " I did n't lose it , " the other man said angrily , scowling at the officer . " She stole it . " " Have you proof of this ? " " Proof ? She 'll have it on her , and that 's all the proof you 'll need . " The girl 's expression was one of such martyred innocence that Ethan nearly laughed aloud . " By all means , search me if you must , " she said with injured dignity . " I will gladly submit if it will convince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , ask this gentleman to search his own pockets as well , for I am sure he is mistaken . " The lieutenant would not have been human if he had not responded to such a plea . He turned to the merchant . " Sir , are you certain your watch is not on your person ? " " Of course I 'm certain . Any fool can see she stole it . " Being called a fool did not sit well with the lieutenant . He frowned . " Would you mind verifying that the watch is missing ? " " Of all the ridiculous ... " The merchant let go of the girl and patted his pockets , muttering impatiently to himself and scowling , but his irritated expression changed to astonishment as he pulled the heavy silver watch out of his coat pocket . " It appears that you have falsely accused this young lady , " the lieutenant said . " I must have misplaced it , " the other man murmured , and Ethan choked back his laughter only with a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked away without another word . The girl turned to the officer , her face shining with gratitude . " Oh , Major , I do n't know how to thank you . " Now that the excitement had passed , the crowd that had gathered around them dissipated . The dandy with the peacock-blue coat walked on with his newspaper , and matrons returned their attention to Colin 's clams . Ethan , however , continued to watch the girl . After such a close call , he expected her to beat a hasty retreat , but he found he had underestimated her . Instead of counting her blessings and going on her way , she lingered beside the officer , talking with him . One or two more flattering comments , a few moments of rapt , wide-eyed attention , and the lieutenant was completely captivated . He smirked and swaggered , too besotted by his bewitching companion to notice when one of her small , delicate hands slid into his pocket . Tongue in cheek , Ethan watched her remove the officer 's money purse quicker than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the devil , he thought in admiration , this girl could get through heaven 's gates by stealing the keys . Impressed by her audacity , Ethan watched , certain that the officer would come to his senses and realize what had happened . But such was not the case . She touched the redcoat 's cheek in a lingering caress of farewell and turned away , leaving the dazed young officer staring after her with an expression on his face similar to that of a bewildered sheep . Giving him one last glance over her shoulder that held all the promise a man could want , she melted into the crowd and disappeared from sight . Still grinning , Ethan watched her go , feeling a hint of regret . He could n't recall witnessing anything recently that had given him more pleasure than the past few moments . That girl was one in a thousand . A movement out of the corner of his eye brought his attention back to the business at hand , and the pretty thief vanished from his mind . Colin was finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and approached the cart . The gazes of the two men met , but neither expressed recognition . No one watching them would ever be able to discern that they knew each other well . " No fresh oysters this morning ? " Ethan asked . " No , sir , but we 've a good supply of clams . " Ethan waved away clams with disinterest . " I wanted oysters . " The fishmonger made a sound of disbelief . " Fresh oysters ? Clams I can dig from shore , but with the harbor closed and the Port Bill in effect , how do you think I 'd get hold of oysters , my good man ? " " Is there nowhere hereabouts a man can find fresh oysters ? " Colin heaved a heavy sigh and said grudgingly , " I 'm told the White Swan sometimes serves ' em raw for breakfast , provided you 've the money to pay . Although where they get ' em from , I 'm sure I do n't know . Must bring ' em in overland during the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice for a meeting . At this hour , it was unlikely anyone would be there , despite Colin 's words about oysters for breakfast . Ethan nodded , tipped his hat in farewell , and left the marketplace . He made his way through the maze of North Boston 's twisting , narrow streets at a brisk pace . His worn and somber clothing of black broadcloth allowed him to blend easily into the crowd around him . He looked like an ordinary merchant , one of many who crowded the streets on early-morning business . He had chosen his clothing this morning for just that purpose . If any of Governor Gage 's spies were following him , they would find it difficult to keep him separate from every other man in the crowd . He doubted he was being followed , but one could never be too careful . Ethan always chose whatever clothing was appropriate to the mission of the moment , but no matter what role he played , there was one thing he always wore : the silver medal concealed beneath his shirt that proclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dangerous , but it was a badge of honor , and Ethan , like all his comrades , never took it off . The White Swan was known by most people in Boston as a Tory pub , but most people never knew about the politics that were discussed in the attic . When Ethan entered the place , the only people there were the owner , Joshua Macalvey , and his younger sister , Dorothy . Joshua stood behind the bar , and Dorothy , a plump and pretty brunette of twenty-two , was clearing tables of the tankards and trenchers left from the night before . Neither of them spoke to him , but Dorothy smiled a greeting , and Joshua jerked his head toward the kitchen . Ethan headed in the direction Joshua had indicated , going through the kitchen and up the back stairs to the attic . His knock on the door was answered immediately , and the door swung inward to reveal that the other two men with whom he had arranged this meeting had arrived before him . Ethan nodded to the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he murmured in greeting , stepped past his oldest boyhood friend , and entered the room . Andrew Fraser , with his melancholy face and deep voice , seemed more like an undertaker than a wine merchant . He was worried , but then , Andrew was always worried . Their mischievous pranks at school and notorious escapades with women during their days together at Harvard had long since given way to the hanging offenses of rebellion and sedition , but the seriousness of the situation could never be gauged by Andrew 's demeanor . Whether it was putting salt in a tutor 's tea , visiting the brothels at Mt . Whoredom , or plotting against the government , Andrew always looked as if doom had come upon them . " We 're taking grave risks by meeting in broad daylight , Ethan , " Andrew reminded him . " Do n't waste time telling me things I already know , my friend . " Andrew shook his head in disapproval . " Could n't this wait for our usual Friday-night rendezvous at the Mermaid ? " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom he recognized as Joseph Bramley , one of Samuel Adams 's messengers . He knew Bramley only by sight , but Samuel trusted his messenger implicitly , and that was good enough for Ethan . " I 'll make this quick , gentlemen . The less we linger here , the better . " Without bothering to remove his hat , he sat down at the table in the center of the room . The others followed suit , and Ethan came directly to the point . " Governor Gage is sending two officers into the country tomorrow morning on a secret mission . " " For what purpose ? " Andrew asked . " To map the countryside from Boston to Worcester . One Captain John Brown and one Ensign Henry De Berniere are to walk on foot to Worcester dressed as countrymen and posing as surveyors . Their mission is to determine the condition of the roads , paying specific attention to possible sites where troops might be ambushed . " The other two men received this news in silence , thinking out its implications . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pompous , but as a governor , he is not the tyrant Hutchinson was . Nor is he a fool . It seems clear that he wants to determine the safest , most discreet route by which he can send troops on the march . " " And those troops will be marching straight for our powder stores in Worcester , " Ethan added . He leaned forward in his chair and spoke his mind . " Gentlemen , we have to send a courier to Worcester and warn the town . " " So they can move our powder and ammunition to a new hiding place before troops arrive to take it ? " Joseph guessed . " Exactly . My sources tell me Gage knows we have more than fifteen tons of powder and thirteen cannon stored there . We can not allow that large a cache of weaponry to fall into Gage 's hands . A few months from now , we will need all the powder and cannon we can get . " Both men leaned back in their chairs , and a long silence followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You think it will come to war , then ? " " I do . War became the only possible course when that damned Port Bill was passed . " The Boston Port Bill had closed the harbor eight months previously , a move intended to starve Boston into submission . Thanks to the generosity of the other colonies , which sent food and supplies into the city over land by Boston Neck , the marketplaces still managed to conduct business . Boston citizens were still able to eat , despite Crown Law , but it was now nearing the end of a long , hard winter , and food prices were high . As food supplies decreased , hatred increased , and war became more likely with each passing day . Ethan went on , " How long can colonials live under what amounts to martial law ? How long before all our freedom is taken away ? It is now impossible for any colonial to get a fair trial in Boston , or speak his mind publicly , or even have a mind of his own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being harassed . Three years ago , we could freely discuss our political opinions . Now , four Whigs ca n't have a pint of ale together without being suspected of sedition . This situation can not continue . " Ethan took a deep breath and looked at the other two . " Let us be blunt , gentlemen . What we are really coming to is complete independence from England . " Joseph 's eyes met his across the table . " Our friends agree with you . I hate to think of it , but I believe it is unavoidable . " Ethan nodded slowly , glad of the reassurance that other Sons of Liberty saw the situation as he did . He had often wished he could communicate directly with men such as Samuel Adams , John Hancock , and Paul Revere , but his public position as a loyal Tory made such a convenience far too risky . Andrew spoke again . " Let us return to the situation of Worcester . Two officers will not take the powder but will simply report back to Gage on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marching there , is that not so ? " " Exactly , " Ethan answered . " My sources tell me Gage intends to accelerate his attempts to take our powder , and in the coming months , reconnaissance missions such as this will become commonplace . Despite the failure at Portsmouth two months ago , Gage is convinced he can avoid war simply by relieving us of our gunpowder one storehouse at a time . " " A shrewd maneuver , " Joseph commented . " He is absolutely correct . Our lack of weaponry is our greatest weakness if it comes to war . " He met Ethan 's eyes across the table . " Are you certain this information is accurate ? How did you come by it ? " " As Andrew will tell you , my sources are reliable . And confidential . " Joseph appeared satisfied by that . " I 'll deliver this news to Paul Revere . He 'll want to ride to Worcester tonight and get word to the militia there . " " Tell Paul to have the militia leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed through . Then move it to a new hiding place . " Joseph nodded . " That way , if the troops do march on the town a few days from now , they 'll come up empty-handed . " Andrew also rose to his feet . " I 'll pass this information on to the Boston and Charlestown militia so we can be ready for the repercussions . If troops march and find nothing for the trouble , God knows what Governor Gage will do . " He glanced at Ethan . " Why on earth did you take the risk of coming out at this hour to bring us this news ? Skulking about in patriot taverns at night posing as a dock worker named John Smith is one thing , Ethan , but during the day you could be recognized much more easily . " " I know , but it was necessary , " Ethan answered , and rose from the table . " I can usually tell when a Gage spy is following me . I do n't believe I was followed . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gage will eventually learn who you really are . You could be arrested , even hanged , for sedition . " " We all face that risk , if it comes to that , " Ethan answered . " But Gage is n't arresting anyone yet . He is a fair man , despite all Samuel 's attempts to paint him otherwise in the Whig newspapers . " " I feel compelled to point out that arrest is not the only risk involved here , " Joseph interjected . " As Ethan Harding , you have access to many friends of the governor . If Gage discovers that Ethan Harding and John Smith are the same person , we will lose you as our most valuable source of information . " " Gage would n't charge me with sedition without better proof than the word of an informant , " Ethan answered . " As I said , he is scrupulously fair . And , given my social position and connections , he will be especially careful to obtain irrefutable proof before arresting me . " Andrew came around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proof can be fabricated . I 'd hate to see you swing on the gallows , my friend . Watch your step . " " Andrew is right , " Joseph said . " Be careful . " Ethan smiled grimly . " I am always careful . "
