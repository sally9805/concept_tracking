In which Our Hero falls in love . Two months earlier Unlike most men of his acquaintance , Gregory Bridgerton believed in true love . He 'd have to have been a fool not to . Consider the following : His eldest brother , Anthony . His eldest sister , Daphne . His other brothers , Benedict and Colin , not to mention his sisters , Eloise , Francesca , and ( galling but true ) Hyacinth , all of whom  --  all of whom  --  were quite happily besotted with their spouses . For most men , such a state of affairs would produce nothing quite so much as bile , but for Gregory , who had been born with an uncommonly cheerful , if occasionally ( according to his younger sister ) annoying , spirit , it simply meant that he had no choice but to believe the obvious : Love existed . It was not a wispy figment of the imagination , designed to keep the poets from complete starvation . It might not be something that one could see or smell or touch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of time before he , too , found the woman of his dreams and settled down to be fruitful , multiply , and take on such baffling hobbies as papier-mache and the collection of nutmeg graters . Although , if one wanted to put a fine point on it , which did seem ratherprecise for such an abstract sort of concept , his dreams did n't exactly include a woman . Well , not one with any specific and identifiable attributes . He did n't know anything about this woman of his , the one who was supposed to transform his life completely , turning him into a happy pillar of boredom and respectability . He did n't know if she would be short or tall , dark or fair . He 'd like to think she would be intelligent and in possession of a fine sense of humor , but beyond that , how was he to know ? She could be shy or outspoken . She might like to sing . Or maybe not . Maybe she was a horsewoman , with a ruddy complexion born of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . When it came to this woman , this impossible , wonderful , and currently nonexistent woman , all he really knew was that when he found her . . . He 'd know . He did n't know how he 'd know ; he just knew that he would . Something this momentous , this earth-shattering and life-altering . . . well , really , it was n't going to whisper its way into existence . It would come full and forceful , like the proverbial ton of bricks . The only question was when . And in the meantime , he saw no reason not to have a fine time while he anticipated her arrival . One did n't need to behave like a monk while waiting for one 's true love , after all . Gregory was , by all accounts , a fairly typical man about London , with a comfortable  --  although by no means extravagant  --  allowance , plenty of friends , and a level enough head to know when to quit a gaming table . He was considered a decent enough catch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( fourth sons never did command a great deal of attention ) , and he was always in demand when the society matrons needed an eligible man to even up the numbers at dinner parties . Which did make his aforementioned allowance stretch a bit further  --  always a benefit . Perhaps he ought to have had a bit more purpose in his life . Some sort of direction , or even just a meaningful task to complete . But that could wait , could n't it ? Soon , he was sure , everything would come clear . He would know just what it was he wished to do , and whom he wished to do it with , and in the meantime , he 'd  - -  Not have a fine time . Not just at this moment , at least . To explain : Gregory was presently sitting in a leather chair , a rather accommodating one , not that that really had any bearing on the matter other than the fact that the lack of discomfort was conducive to daydreaming , which in turn was conducive to not listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was standing approximately four feet away , droning on about something or other , almost certainly involving some variation of the words duty and responsibility . Gregory was n't really paying attention . He rarely did . Well , no , occasionally he did , but  --  " Gregory ? Gregory ! " He looked up , blinking . Anthony 's arms were crossed , never a good sign . Anthony was the Viscount Bridgerton , and had been for more than twenty years . And while he was , Gregory would be the first to insist , the very best of brothers , he would have made a rather fine feudal lord . " Begging your pardon for intruding upon your thoughts , such as they are , " Anthony said in a dry voice , " but have you , - perhaps  --  just perhaps  --  heard anything I 've said ? " " Diligence , " Gregory parroted , nodding with what he deemed sufficient gravity . " Direction . " " Indeed , " Anthony replied , and Gregory congratulated himself on what had clearly been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you finally sought some direction in your life . " " Of course , " Gregory murmured , mostly because he 'd missed supper , and he was hungry , and he 'd heard that his sister-in-law was serving light refreshments in the garden . Besides , it never made sense to argue with Anthony . Never . " You must make a change . Choose a new course . " " Indeed . " Maybe there would be sandwiches . He could eat about forty of those ridiculous little ones with the crusts cut off right then . " Gregory . " Anthony 's voice held that tone . The one that , while impossible to describe , was easy enough to recognize . And Gregory knew it was time to pay attention . " Right , " he said , because truly , it was remarkable how well a single syllable could delay a proper sentence . " I expect I 'll join the clergy . " That stopped Anthony cold . Dead , frozen , cold . Gregory paused to savor the moment . Too bad he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I beg your pardon , " Anthony finally murmured . " It 's not as if I 've many choices , " Gregory said . And as the words emerged , he realized it was the first time he 'd spoken them . It somehow made them more real , more permanent . " It 's the military or the clergy , " he continued , " and , well , it 's got to be said  --  I 'm a beastly bad shot . " Continues ...
