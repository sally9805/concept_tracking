<p> When Victor Sarmiento reports to work aboard the Lynchburg Ferry each day , he worries about what he will breathe . <p> For 12 years , as he has steered the commuter ferry across the Houston Ship Channel , Sarmiento occasionally has been overtaken by fumes - odors so strong they burn his eyes and his nose and make him wonder whether there will be long-term effects on his health . <p> " It 's still here . It 's still around , " Sarmiento , 49 , said of the stench , which was so powerful in June that it invaded his enclosed pilot box with its panoramic view of nearby industrial plants . " I do n't know what it is , or what kind of health problems it causes . " <p> The Lynchburg Ferry is one of 11 hot spots in the Houston region , where levels of toxic chemicals in 2004 exceeded state odor thresholds or health guidelines in more locales than any other part of Texas , according to the latest air pollution data from the state . <p> Most are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrations of hazardous air pollutants recorded by state monitors reached levels high enough to create sickening odors or increase the chances of getting cancer if an individual were exposed over a lifetime . <p> In some cases , such as Galena Park and the southeast Houston neighborhood of Manchester , the data show the problem has been there for years despite a state permit process that is supposed to ensure pollution does not exceed health and odor guidelines . <p> " The goal of our agency is to help ensure that people do n't have health effects from air emissions . We do n't want that any more than they do n't want that , " said Michael Honeycutt , chief of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality 's toxicology section . The agency collects pollution data from 41 monitors in four counties around Houston . <p> " We have only a handful of places where we have concerns , " Honeycutt said . " The problem is that those handful of places are surrounded by large amounts of industry and it is really hard to figure out the source . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TCEQ , for the first time , plans to talk to local leaders to assess how best to disseminate the report 's conclusions to people living in the impacted communities . <p> Galena Park Mayor Bobby Barrett had yet to hear word on Monday of his community 's high benzene readings . " It really bothers me that I am not getting these figures , " Barrett said . " We have three schools around that monitor . This would affect each one of those . " <p> In Galveston County , health officials said the pollution levels were worthy of investigation , but did not warrant a public health warning . " At this point , it was n't considered a big health threat , " said Kurt Koopmann , of the county 's health district . <p> Houston Mayor Bill White said the latest data again point to a need for the state to better evaluate emissions from multiple sources before it issues a permit to a company to pollute . The state currently evaluates the impact of pollution on a facility-by-facility basis , rather than looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On Monday , White named Councilwoman Carol Alvarado as chair of City Council 's first Environmental and Public Health Committee . She hails from Manchester , where state data show high concentrations of 1,3-butadiene . <p> In 2004 , average concentrations of butadiene in Milby Park were the highest they 've been since 2000 . " I am disturbed that the butadiene levels in the Milby Park area increased again , " Alvarado said . <p> Workers ' health complaints <p> In 2004 , the report showed concentrations of 11 different chemicals exceeded levels where an odor would be noticeable 143 times . More than half of those violations occurred at the Lynchburg Ferry , where several employees , including Sarmiento , reported feeling ill in June because of fumes . <p> Long-term concentrations of carcinogenic pollutants were a concern at seven of the 11 sites . Specifically , TCEQ found : <p> Concentrations of benzene , a human carcinogen at the Lynchburg Ferry , in Galena Park and in Texas City , at levels that if inhaled continuously over 70 years could result in 10 to 60 additional people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TCEQ has said it wants every community in the state to have a cancer risk from pollution no greater than 10 in 1 million . Some other states have goals of one in 1 million . <p> High levels of formaldehyde in Channelview , Deer Park and along Clinton Drive . Formaldehyde is not a proven carcinogen , but can cause irritation of the eyes , nose and throat . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is evaluating the risk posed by the odorous chemical . <p> At Milby Park , where a Chronicle study in summer 2004 found risky concentrations of 1,3-butadiene , the state data reaffirmed the newspaper 's results : Butadiene , a carcinogen emitted from nearby plants , is at levels there that could possibly , over a lifetime , cause an additional 300 people in a population of 1 million to get cancer . However , data taken this year show that the levels in the area , where nearby companies have signed agreements to reduce their emissions , are on their way down . <p> " The levels that are in these hot spots remain troubling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are seeking to work with these companies that are associated with these levels to reduce them , " said Jonathan Ward , a professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston . <p> In some places , finding pollution sources will be easier than in others . At Milby Park , the large sources of butadiene were obvious . But benzene , formaldehyde and some of the compounds responsible for odors in the region are being emitted by a plethora of sources , including industry , cars , even household products . <p> State officials say they are armed with new tools to hunt down the sources - including infrared cameras that can spot leaks , monitors that measure and report pollution closer to real time , and strategies in place to analyze the data quicker . <p> " We are getting the best possible information . We are using new means to find out where the problems may be . We are acting faster , " TCEQ member Ralph Marquez said . <p> At the Lynchburg Ferry , investigations by the state and Harris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shipyard . Regulators believe the barge-cleaning facility north of the ferry landing is responsible for the high levels of styrene detected in the area . <p> That chemical could have been responsible for the odors the ferry workers reported . People who take the three-minute ride across the Ship Channel each day are unlikely to be exposed long enough to be put at risk . <p> Business faces probe <p> The Galveston County Health District , along with the state , plans to investigate Black Marlin Pipeline after an analysis showed that benzene recorded at the Texas City monitor is highest when blowing from the facility 's direction . <p> " It is something that does merit a closer look , " said Kelly Swan , a spokesman for Williams Co. , which owns the natural gas processing facility . " We are committed to full compliance with all air pollution regulations ... and would be happy to participate in any investigation . " <p> In Galena Park , the state is zeroing in on a band of industry along Clinton Drive , southeast of the monitor with the high benzene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributing to the risky concentration of benzene is a tank farm run by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners . Of the 100 tanks on site , only one - a 12,000-gallon container - holds benzene . <p> The company said it is " in total compliance with all environmental laws , regulations and facility permits at Galena Park . " <p> Lorena Guilanshah , a Kinder Morgan spokeswoman , noted , however , that there is a lot of other industry in the same general direction . <p> For a complete copy of the state 's 2004 analysis of air pollution data , log onto www.chron.com/metro <p> NOTES : dina.cappiello@chron.com <p> CORRECTION-DATE : January 12 , 2006 <p> CORRECTION : <p> CORRECTION : A map that accompanied this story used symbols representing the molecular structure of hazardous chemicals detected by state air monitors in the Houston area in 2004 .
