John Baxter made his decision as his family was leaving the hospital . <p> Elaine had shared with him and his family a moment of deep tragedy and deep love , a time that had bonded them beyond any other shared experience . He held her hand as they walked silently to the car . In a few hours , everyone would meet back at the Baxter house for dinner . They needed to be together , needed to share about how the brief life of little Sarah , his granddaughter , had touched them , changed them . <p> But in the meantime he could n't shake the feeling inside , the certainty that he wanted Elaine in his life not only in moments like this but always . <p> Elaine 's car was parked near his , but before she went to it , she stopped . " You 're quiet . " <p> He smiled and a calm worked through his soul . He was worn-out and weary , but he was no longer discouraged , not after what he 'd witnessed this afternoon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Elaine would be joining them for dinner after she spent a few hours at home . They all needed some downtime . But the look in her eyes told him that she would stand in the parking lot all day if he needed her . " Wan na talk about it ? " She angled her head , her eyes soft . <p> John could feel the warmth in his heart shining through his eyes . " God 's bringing some of the details into focus . About how much I need you . " <p> She looked surprised and touched and maybe a little shy . " That 's a good thing . " <p> " We 'll talk more about it later . " He hugged her , and they said their good-byes . <p> When John was alone in his car , the decision in his heart took root , writing itself across his soul and changing his picture of the future . The drive home seemed longer than usual and marked by a new sort of thrill and loneliness . He entered the old house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he stopped and leaned against the doorframe . Every inch of the place still held memories of Elizabeth , the way it always would . He walked up to their room and hesitated at the photo of her on his dresser . " You were there with us today , dear . I felt you . " <p> He gripped the dresser , and his thoughts drifted back to earlier today . Before he left the hospital , Ashley had shown him Cole 's picture . The artwork by his eight-year-old grandson had brought him the same much-needed comfort as it brought Ashley and her husband , Landon . Nothing could be more fitting than the image of Elizabeth holding little Sarah in heaven , taking care of her until they could all be together again . <p> He moved to the card table he 'd set up at the end of his bed . Elizabeth 's handwritten letters were spread across it , more organized than before , and on one end was a stack already copied . The project had outgrown this space , so later tonight he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finished copying , he would have six sets of her letters-one for each of their children . Each yellowed letter carefully opened and reread had filled his heart with Elizabeth 's presence and made him miss her more than ever . But now the emotional , painstaking process was nearly behind him , and he was almost ready to put the letters into scrapbooks and pass them out . He had a feeling there was something in Elizabeth 's words that would make a dramatic difference in each of their adult children . <p> Even with baby Sarah 's funeral planned for later in the week , he would focus his energy on the letters . It was time , and it was the right thing to do . When he was finished , he would finally have closure , finally have walked through everything left of the woman he still so dearly loved . He would need that closure because of the decision he 'd made an hour ago . The decision that one day very soon he would take the step he had been certain he would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife . <p> * * * <p> Dayne Matthews gripped the wooden railing of his back porch and stared out at the distant water . Even with the sorrow from earlier today , the sun sprayed a blanket of light across the surface of Lake Monroe . From inside the lake house he could hear the soft voice of his wife , Katy , talking to her agent again , trying to keep the conversation short . <p> This was n't a day for business deals . <p> He squinted against the shine of sparkling lake water and lifted his eyes to the deep blue sky . No matter how many Hollywood roles he 'd played , regardless of all the emotion he 'd conveyed and seen acted out across the big screen over the years , he 'd never seen anything like the strength and faith of his sister Ashley . <p> The events from a few hours ago came to life again-the call from his father , John Baxter , asking them to come quickly , and the way he felt walking into Ashley 's hospital room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their spouses and children , the people he 'd missed out on all his life until recently-filled every possible space , circling Ashley 's bed . <p> Of course , Ashley and Landon had known for months that their unborn baby girl would n't survive more than a few days . Anencephaly was merciless that way . The miracle everyone prayed for was n't an unexplained healing but rather what happened today in the few short hours of Sarah 's life . <p> The screen door sounded behind him , and he looked over his shoulder . Even on a day marked with so much sadness , his heart still found room for the familiar awe . Katy Hart had actually married him , agreed to put aside her private life in Bloomington , Indiana , and join him on his public journey of fame . <p> Now if only they could survive the ride . <p> He turned and held out his arms . " C'mere . " <p> Her steps were slow , measured , her expression lost and distant , as if the brief life and tender death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached him , she eased her hands around his waist and laid her head on his shoulder . For a long time the only sound was the cry of a lone hawk in a distant tree . <p> Finally Katy drew a shaky breath and stepped back so she could see his eyes . " We can do it ... right , Dayne ? " <p> He let himself get lost in her touch , in the sweet caress of her voice . " Do what ? " <p> She sighed . Her expression held fear and determination in equal amounts . " Use the next four weeks to remember what matters . Before the world tries to tear us apart again . " <p> Four weeks . That 's all the time they had to savor a semblance of normalcy in Bloomington , to enjoy their lake house and remember the reasons they 'd fallen in love . Just four weeks . Frustration built in a hurry and took the edge off his good feelings . He set his jaw , and for a moment he looked past her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking , encouraging her to star in a movie opposite him ? As if that were n't enough fodder for the tabloids , in less than a month they would face the debut episode of the reality show based on their shared movie experience . Both the show and their upcoming movie had been moved from a January release to the upcoming fall debut . His agent had explained the schedule change best . " Right now , no one 's hotter than you two . The studios realize that . " Everyone with a dime to make was counting on the conflicts between Dayne and Katy , racy headlines that during the filming had brought them to the breaking point . <p> But that was before they returned home to Bloomington . Here , finding love was as natural as breathing . Amid the sprawling country fields and rolling hills and endless sky , love had returned like a summer breeze , washing over them and assuring them that everything would be okay . And how could it not , in the company of the Baxters , surrounded by more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You 're not answering me . " Katy 's expression softened , and sadness added to the mix . <p> He brushed his cheek against hers . " I wish it were four years . " <p> " Or more . " Katy rested her head on his shoulder again . " There 's no way back , is there ? " <p> She was talking about their upcoming movies , the fact that in a couple of months she would fl y to London and he to Cabo San Lucas , Mexico . For ten weeks they would be separated , fulfilling their obligations while the rags took shots at them . A heaviness settled over his heart . <p> " Ah , Katy . " He held her close . The faint smell of her perfume , her skin , filled his senses and heightened the subtle urgency in their hushed tones . " Someday , maybe . When all this is behind us . " He did n't say it , and she did n't either , but what if they never made it to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and her world grabbed hold of her ? And what if they found themselves pulled so hard toward distant shores that they lost sight of the promises they made on a beach in the Mayan Riviera what felt like a lifetime ago ? <p> They talked about someday often , especially since they 'd been home from Los Angeles . Someday , when they 'd say good-bye to Hollywood and acting and every aspect of the celebrity life . When they 'd settle down in Bloomington and maybe bring to life again the Christian Kids Theater group Katy missed so much . A time when they 'd have walks on the shore of Lake Monroe , Sunday supper with the Baxters , and babies of their own . The picture grew and swelled and filled Dayne 's heart and soul because nothing could be better . <p> But they had a war to win between now and someday , the war they 'd welcomed by agreeing to do the reality show . For Real was supposed to be a white flag , a way of giving in to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't land on the set of their recently wrapped movie looking for happily-ever-after scenes . They stirred conflict from the beginning , creating headlines that screamed of doubt and unfaithfulness . <p> And the show had n't even aired yet . <p> Dayne kissed her forehead . " What did your agent say ? " <p> " He wanted to make sure I had a passport . " She sounded tired . " I told him I did , of course . Because of our wedding . " <p> For a heartbeat the world fell away , and Dayne could see all the way to the center of her soul , the way he had once seen her before the tension of the past few months . " It was beautiful , was n't it ? " <p> She smiled . " Sometimes in my dreams I see it again , playing out so real I can smell the ocean air . " <p> He nuzzled his face against hers . " Too bad you could n't get your movie switched to Cabo . " <p> The sun was setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what lay ahead . " It 'd be hard to shoot Big Ben from Cabo . " <p> " True . " He placed his hands on either side of her face and touched his lips to hers . Their kiss was slow , with a hesitancy born of the tension that had marked the recent weeks . But it kindled a passion that knew no bounds , and after a while , their breathing changed and a knowing filled her eyes . <p> " I love you , Dayne . " Her whispered words betrayed the intensity of her feelings , the way her body responded to his . <p> Even in the worst of times , their marriage had been marked by a physical love that seemed almost divine-a gift from the God they both believed in , the God who Dayne prayed would keep them together in the coming months when it might look easier to walk away . <p> " I love you too . " He held her closer . " Do n't ever stop saying it , okay ? And I wo n't either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... I wo n't ever stop . " She kissed him again and spoke close to his ear . " Let 's go inside . " <p> He swallowed and eased his fingers between hers . As they went in , as they walked past the kitchen and down the hallway toward their bedroom , Dayne still was n't sure about the someday they dreamed of . But for now they had something else , something that here and now maybe mattered more . <p> They had four weeks . <p> A WORD FROM KAREN KINGSBURY <p> Dear Friends , <p> What an emotional journey it 's been , trying to bring to a close my series on the Baxters . Especially this installment , which was written in the weeks after my dad 's death . My dad always told me that one day everyone would know what a wonderful writer I was . But having him in my life made me know for certain that life was about so much more than writing . <p> My dad was a firm believer in life . I told you that last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's why none of us were overly shocked when he survived his heart attack in what could only be described as a miracle . You can read about it on my Web site at www.KarenKingsbury.com . <p> Clearly because of what we went through with my dad , the idea of miracles was on my heart like never before . I 've heard from thousands of you who told me how glad you were that Ashley 's baby did n't receive a miraculous healing at the end of the last book , Summer . It was n't that you wished bad things for poor Ashley . But you wanted a real story , a way of seeing God 's hand at work even when life does n't go the way we want . <p> I 'm glad you were happy with that ending . It was the only one I could 've written , knowing the powerful God we serve and the very real certainty of heartache all around us . And so in this book , I had the chance to bring to light the fact that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen that a number of times in people close to us and in our community . With the passing of my dad , we saw it personally . <p> God is at work , even in our storms . <p> The story of Ashley and Dayne and Luke all finding their someday by the end of this book was also one in which I felt compelled to talk about the battles of life . The deaths and illnesses , the broken relationships and ruined finances . God tells us in 2 Chronicles that we do n't have to fight our battles alone . He 'll go before us . <p> Is n't that the greatest news ? For those who love Christ , wherever you go , you 're protected . The battle is won , no matter how grim the situation seems . <p> At our house , we love when Donald takes out his guitar and everyone gathers around to sing songs of praise to God . We 'll sit outside on the front porch or gather in one of the kids ' bedrooms . Between songs , Donald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hour progresses , the heart of each of the kids becomes more tender . Sometimes a few of them will have quiet tears as the time wraps up . Why ? Because victory comes in praising God . <p> Now , about the Baxters . I know .... I know . I hear from you , my faithful friends , many , many times each week . " Please , " you write , " do n't let the Baxters end ! You ca n't stop writing about these people . " <p> Believe me , I 'm as upset about writing the final chapter of Sunset as you are . And so I 've decided to keep the characters alive in a different way . With the conclusion of the Sunrise series , after the final book , Sunset , releases , I will start a blog on my Web site and in my monthly newsletters . One day you might hear from Ashley and another day from Dayne . John will weigh in on his new marriage , and Katy will share the joys of being a first-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you 'll be kept aware of how the Baxters are doing and what 's happening next . <p> And of course there will be more stories , more families and issues and emotionally driven characters and plots in the years to come , God willing . I have so many stories in my heart , so many times when we will meet again between the covers of a book . So stay posted . <p> Also , if you chose to start a relationship with Christ for the first time while reading this book , please get ahold of a Bible and read the book of John . Mark it and highlight it , underline it and memorize it . Scripture is the strongest weapon we have as we march into battle with God at our side . Then find a Bible-believing church where you can grow in the love and knowledge of our mighty King . <p> If you 're unable to find a Bible or you ca n't afford one and if you 've chosen now to start that life-saving relationship with Christ , then send me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " New Life . " Include your address , and I will send you a Bible . <p> As always , you can find out more information and sign up for my newsletter on my Web site . I have contests in the works and journal entries about my life as a Christian wife and mother as well as my ministry of fiction . In addition , you can find photos of soldiers who need your prayers as they serve our country . My contact information is there as well . Do n't forget : I love hearing from you ! <p> On that note , find a song and sing it as often as you can . Oh , and if your parents are still alive , call them and tell them you love them . Today , while there 's still time . <p> Until we meet again , in His light and love , <p> Karen Kingsbury <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
