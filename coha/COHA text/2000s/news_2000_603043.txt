<p> GREENVILLE , S.C .  --  Those attending the meeting at the Chamber of Commerce were unanimous : The Confederate battle flag should not be flying atop the Statehouse in Columbia . <p> One by one , leaders from what South Carolinians call the Upstate region talked about their proposal . They emphasized that their plan for an alternate memorial for the flag , somewhere on the Statehouse grounds , had support from blacks and whites . <p> Blacks and whites were solicited , they kept repeating ; blacks and whites . No one mentioned Hispanics . Or Asians . Or any of a dozen nationalities representing immigrants drawn in recent years to this region in the northwest corner of South Carolina by international companies such as German automaker BMW and tire giant Michelin . <p> It is that sort of fixation on ancient antagonisms that drives many South Carolinians crazy . This state , the first to secede from the Union in 1861 , has become one of the Southeast 's emerging business stars . The forces of progress had hoped to strut that image before Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national publicity . It has n't turned out that way . <p> " This state had a chance to show the nation just how much it 's changed since the bad old days , " says William Whitney , president and chief executive officer of the Urban League of the Upstate and a lifelong South Carolinian . Instead , he and others say , what the nation sees is a place forever looking backward , a state still fighting the Civil War . Never mind how much South Carolina has changed , they fret , how much it has courted an international business community , how hospitable it has been to waves of immigrants . <p> What outsiders see , they fear , is a state where blacks and whites seem consumed by their unresolved issues . And the battle over the Confederate flag  --  whether it should continue to fly over the Capitol with the U.S. and South Carolina flags  --  is the symbol of that discord . <p> " This issue just tarnishes the image of South Carolina , " says Paula Harper Bethea , a native and chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a South Carolina that really does n't exist . " <p> The state has transformed itself economically and demographically over the past 10 years . Once reliant primarily on textile mills and agriculture , South Carolina now boasts high-tech firms and automobile assembly plants . Since 1990 , it has added 200,000 jobs and nearly 400,000 people , many from other regions of the country or other countries . <p> Misunderstandings <p> Some of the new South Carolinians say that because of the flag fight , they have to fend off unwarranted accusations of racism when they travel . Others say they are simply puzzled . <p> " The U.S. flag has meaning to me because I 'm a U.S. citizen , and the South Carolina flag has meaning to me because I live here . I feel like they both belong to me , " says Aimon Kopera , 35 , an entrepreneur who moved here from Pittsburgh eight years ago . " As for the Confederate flag , I 've read the history , so I know the issues involved . I just do n't understand why it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> That is why former senator Bill Bradley flew into the Palmetto state last week to slam the Republican front-runners for their positions on the flag . Arizona Sen. John McCain calls the flag a " symbol of heritage " ; Texas Gov . George W. Bush says the issue should be resolved by South Carolinians . <p> What seems to be lost in the flurry of political haymaking , though , is that the debate has changed dramatically in the past month . <p> The NAACP announced a national boycott last summer against the state 's $ 14 billion-a-year tourism industry . Then , on the Martin Luther King Jr . holiday last month , 46,000 people marched in Columbia to protest the flag , the largest demonstration in the city 's history . After those events , the debate shifted . Suddenly , there is wide agreement among the public and politicians alike that the flag no longer should fly atop the Capitol . Now the debate centers on finding an alternative site . <p> The flag 's supporters are willing to move it from the Capitol to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the opponents , attuned to public opinion polls showing that most residents want the flag removed , say the banner should be displayed less conspicuously or banished from the Statehouse grounds . <p> Lonnie Randolph , a state NAACP official , says the flag belongs either in a glass exhibit case inside the Capitol or off the grounds entirely , in the Confederate Relic Room and Museum . <p> That will never happen , vows state Sen. Glenn McConnell , a Republican from Charleston who has fought efforts to relocate the flag . " To me , that flag represents the courage , the valor and the sacrifice of South Carolinians who answered the call of the elected government and died in service to the state , " he says . <p> Flag opponents hope that other old-time South Carolinians will help find a resolution . They are counting on people like Charleston Mayor Joe Riley , a Democrat who was one of the state 's first white politicians to call for relocating the flag . He has his Southern bona fides : his great-great-grandfather fought for the South . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they put away their uniforms and put away the flag in a place of respect , " he says . <p> " An amazing number of people have a blood tie to someone who died in the war . . . or who suffered losses in the war , " says Thomas Terrill , author of The American South : A History . " They think the people calling for the flag to be taken down are attacking their heritage . " <p> Haunting images <p> For many African-Americans , though , the flag conjures feelings just as powerful . It evokes painful images of slavery , or haunting memories of the night-riding Klansmen of a later era . <p> " This is much deeper than just a flag , " says David Swinton , president of Benedict College , the historically black school in Columbia . " That flag says , ' This is a white supremacist Statehouse . ' " <p> The Confederate battle flag has flown over the Statehouse since 1962 , when it was raised to celebrate the centennial of the Civil War . But legislators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbolize their defiance of the racial and social changes sweeping the region . Two states , Georgia and Mississippi , incorporate the emblem in their official state flags , but South Carolina is the only state flying the banner above its Capitol . <p> And though some defend the flag as heritage , the icon has been commandeered in recent years by the Ku Klux Klan and some Skinhead groups . It is now seen most often simply as a symbol of defiant racism . That is what prompted the boycott . <p> Scores of convention groups , athletic events and family reunions have canceled visits . The NAACP says 130 conventions and more than 100 family reunions have been moved elsewhere . State tourism officials say the boycott has cost about $ 7 million in lost revenue since last summer . <p> There were other costs . State and business officials say some companies have been reluctant to relocate or expand here because of the flag controversy . <p> Still , state Sen. Robert Ford says statewide sentiment had already begun to turn in favor of removing the flag before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag down this year or next year without a boycott , " says the Charleston Democrat , an African-American who introduced that chamber 's first flag-lowering bill in 1993 . <p> The Legislature must approve any relocation of the flag . The state Senate passed a compromise in 1994 that would have moved the flag to the Confederate memorial and set up a black heritage monument nearby . The House blocked that bill and has never voted on another flag measure . <p> The polls showing a majority in favor of moving the flag are driven by people like Carol Shucker , 52 . <p> The white Greenville schoolteacher says she never paid attention to scrapping over the flag until last year , when she read an editorial in The Greenville News . The article argued that the flag should not fly over the Capitol because it implies that the government is governed by it . <p> She says she now believes the flag should be given a place of honor elsewhere on the Capitol grounds , and she marched in the King Day rally because she wanted her voice heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . " And I did n't want to sleep through this . " <p> In recent days , talk of the flag and the boycott dominated conversation from the corridors of government to the stately homes and restored plantations of the Low Country around Charleston and to the landscaped golf courses around Myrtle Beach . <p> But it is here in the Upstate that the flag fight seems most out of step with today 's South Carolina . The five-county Greenville metropolitan area , with a population approaching 1 million , is the booming center of the state 's wealthiest , fastest-growing and most ethnically diverse region . <p> Unwelcome attention <p> So many have moved here from other nations that the International Center of the Upstate opened last year to serve immigrants from more than 15 countries . The tidy , welcoming streets downtown are lined with restaurants catering to every culture . The city bustles with possibility , but many of those lured by its opportunities say the flag battle is an unwelcome distraction . <p> " They 're spending too much time on this issue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , Bill , moved here seven years ago from Orlando and recently opened a restaurant downtown . " I can think of a lot of other issues that need more attention : drugs , poverty , homelessness . " <p> Geologist Brad Staub , 45 , who moved here 10 years ago from New Jersey , says , " It 's ridiculous that we have to spend so much time dealing with this . " <p> CORRECTION-DATE : February 15 , 2000 , Tuesday <p> CORRECTION : In some editions Monday , USA TODAY mistakenly reported that the population of Greenville , S.C. , is 1 million . The Cover Story should have said that 1 million people live in the five-county area around Greenville . The story also misidentified a schoolteacher quoted about her views of the Confederate flag controversy . Her correct name is Pam Shucker . And the story said South Carolina seceded from the union in 1861 when , in fact , secession was declared Dec. 20 , 1860.
