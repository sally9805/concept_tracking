You dial the number , and the automated voice answers . " Our menu has changed , " the voice says . And you are thinking , Yes , it 's going to be even worse than before . Customer experiences like those thrill Karl-Heinz Land , whose VoiceObjects program threatens to make us actually enjoy automated-voice systems . <P> In the same way that Apple 's Macintosh created a graphic user interface , GUI ( pronounced goo-ey ) , that made it easy for ordinary mortals to use personal computers , Land has laid claim to what he unabashedly calls a VUI ( voo-ey ) , or vocal user interface .
