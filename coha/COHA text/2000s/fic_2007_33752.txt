Chapter One We Take the Train I did n't always live here . And by " here " I do not mean the La Brea Tar Pits , where I am writing this down in a notebook-I mean Los Angeles . When I was a little kid I lived in Chicago . On Wilshire Boulevard , in Los Angeles , there is a restaurant shaped like a hat . It is called the Brown Derby , and that 's what it looks like-one of those derby hats , with the round top and the little brim all around . There is a sign outside that says eat in the hat . And people do . I knew about this because I saw pictures in Look magazine . The pictures showed the restaurant , the eat in the hat sign , and two movie stars-I think it was Bette Davis and Laird Cregar-inside the hat , eating cheeseburgers . They were eating cheeseburgers with knives and forks ! This was interesting too . I had only found out about cheeseburgers a short time before-and had actually eaten only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat them with knives and forks , but I thought of them as grown-up and sophisticated food even before learning that movie stars ate them . Anyway , when I read about the Brown Derby and saw the pictures , it became one of my life 's ambitions to eat there . I have to confess , I was not clear about exactly where Los Angeles , California , was-if it was not too far , maybe I could get my father to drive us over one day in the Buick . So I mentioned it to my father , and I learned two things . I learned that Los Angeles , California , of which Hollywood is a part ( the reason that movie stars eat in the Brown Derby ) , was way out West , and it took more than two days to get there by train . The other thing I learned ... Well , this is what my father said : " Neddie , my boy ! It is also my lifelong ambition to eat in the restaurant shaped like a hat ! " And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we eat in the hat , we will all go and live in Los Angeles , California ! We can eat in the hat all the time , and pick lemons off the trees , and live in the sunshine . " A week later , we had packed up our clothes , moving men had come and taken away the furniture , I had said goodbye to my friends forever , and my father , my mother , and my sister , Eloise , and I were on the Super Chief , which is a fancy deluxe train that goes from Chicago to Los Angeles . You might think there was something weird about my family-my father , anyway-and there is . He is unpredictable and tends to do things that surprise people , until they get used to him . My mother seems normal at first , but she 's married to him and always goes along with his ideas-like the parakeets , for instance . I bought a parakeet for ninety-nine cents at the dime store . Little blue parakeet . I named him Henry . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : goldfish , canaries , and parakeets . The usual price for parakeets is a dollar and a half , but they sell the shrimpy ones for ninety-nine cents . A dinky wire cage costs twenty-five cents , and the guy in the pet department threw in a box of birdseed for free . My father thought Henry was the greatest thing he 'd ever seen , and a week later he came home with eleven more , a big cage with a parakeet playground , ladders and bells and perches and mirrors , a book on parakeet care , and bags and bags of stuff for them to eat . After a week of playing with the parakeets and reading up on them , he made it my job to take care of them : clean the cage , spray them for mites , smear Vaseline on their feet-also , I was supposed to train them to hop onto my finger , and teach them to talk . The talking never worked out- probably because we had so many of them . The book said that in order to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and repeat whatever word you wanted it to learn while it was going to sleep at night , and again the first thing in the morning . With a dozen parakeets , they just talked to one another , chirping and whistling and screaming . I did n't mind being the family parakeet-keeper , but it was a lot of work . Also , I felt sorry for my parakeet , Henry , because all my father 's birds were bigger , and they picked on him and made him miserable . My father liked to let them fly around the apartment , the whole flock of them , whirring through the air and pooping on things . When it was time to put them back in their cage , I had to catch them one by one , which was n't easy . What worried me was that he might bring home more parakeets-or something worse . Sometimes he would talk about monkeys . " I am looking for a monkey , " he would tell me . " I just missed getting one-no bigger than this , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was . " When I went back to the pet store , someone had bought it . But do n't worry , Neddie . We will find a monkey . " I did worry . I worried a lot . I worried that he would find not one monkey but twelve monkeys . Those were going to be hard to catch-and they probably bit a lot harder than parakeets . " Do n't you think it would be nice to have a dog ? " I asked my father . " Just a regular dog ? " " You should have seen this monkey , " my father said . " He was just like a tiny person . " I think maybe there was already a plan to move to Los Angeles and everybody just forgot to tell me about it , or maybe not . My mother was used to my father , as I said , and when he announced we were moving across the country in a week , she just started getting things ready . Eloise seemed to be all right with the idea as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older than I am , was in high school at the time , and did n't discuss things with me very much . Or , maybe my father really had thought of it on the spur of the moment when I asked him about the eat-in-the-hat restaurant . My father is an eccentric . I did n't know that word at the time , but I knew he was one . He 's not crazy or anything like that . He does n't rave or flip his lips with a finger and go bibble , bibble . He just does things such as suddenly move his whole family to California , or travel in a deluxe double drawing room on the Super Chief with a bunch of parakeets . The Second World War had ended a few years earlier , and my father came out of the war a rich man . He had gotten rich selling shoelaces to the army and the navy . Brown shoelaces to the army and black shoelaces to the navy . Before the war started he had gone to this auction . An auction is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out how much they are willing to pay and the highest bid gets it . He was at this auction , and one of the items was a large lot of shoelaces-it turned out to be a boxcar full of them . He won the whole thing for fifty-seven dollars . It turned out that along with the shoelaces came a shoelace-making machine . All this machine does is put the little metal or plastic tips on the ends of the shoelaces-the actual shoelace stuff comes in big rolls . You want fourteen-inch shoelaces , you put the little metal tip , which is called an aglet , every fourteen inches ; you want a sixteen-inch shoelace , you put the aglet every sixteen inches . He got more machines and had a shoelace factory . After the war , my father invented plaid shoelaces , and shoelaces in colors like pink and bright blue . People bought millions of them . And this is why my father was rich , and why we were on the deluxe Super Chief going to Los Angeles without a care in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father had booked a double drawing room-that 's two of the largest compartments , with the wall between them folded open to make something like a tiny apartment , with two tiny bathrooms , armchairs that turn into beds , and long benchlike sofas that fold into beds at night , also beds that fold down out of the wall , and you climb a little ladder to get in . The walls and ceiling were made of steel , painted pale green , and the floor was carpeted . There was a little white button on the wall , and when you pressed it you 'd hear a bell go ding somewhere far away and a Pullman porter would come . There are these guys , Pullman porters , black guys with deep voices , elegant manners , and starched white jackets . When you travel in a double drawing room , the porters give you extra-good service , because you are obviously somebody important or rich . Our porters were Mr. Frederick and Mr. Jefferson . They called my father Mr. Wentworthstein , which is our name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7-Up , which I had never had before . My father said that 7-Up was the perfect beverage for train travel , and I agreed with him . Looking out the window I saw other travelers hurrying to get on the Super Chief , redcaps-who are guys with red caps-rolling carts piled high with luggage , chefs in white coats and those tall chef 's hats , loading boxes and boxes of things to cook into the dining car . There were conductors in blue suits with shiny brass buttons , the engineer in striped overalls , various railroad guys checking the wheels-everyone hustling and bustling-plus hot , steamy smells and powerful buzzing and hissing noises . The train itself was like a big living thing , like a dinosaur or a giant snake . You had to go up some steep steel steps to get into it . Once you were in it , it smelled ... like a train-I did n't have anything to compare it to-it smelled of leather and clean carpeting , and hot motor oil , and rich people . There was a lot of scurrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Frederick and Mr. Jefferson made sure all our suitcases were on board ; the conductor , in his blue suit , came by and punched our tickets with a shiny silver ticket puncher . We looked out the window again . The rush of people on the platform was thinning out , getting slower . There were clunks and thumps as the steel stairs were folded up , and the doors banged shut . Some of the people outside the train were friends and relatives of people who were taking the trip . They waved and made faces at their friends who were on board . Guys in blue railroad suits wrote things down on clipboards and looked at pocket watches . " All aboard ! " somebody hollered . The people on the platform took a step back from the train . More bumps , thumps , and bangs . A guy in a railroad uniform , looking annoyed , walked fast alongside the train , up toward the engine . Then he walked back the other way . Everybody on the platform was standing still , facing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bump the other way . Nobody said anything . Another bump . The people on the platform were sliding to the left . Poles and columns and baggage carts too . We were moving ! I could feel the wheels rumble under us . Slowly , slowly , the train was moving out of the station ! " Let 's let the birds out of the boxes , " my father said . " They need a little exercise . " My father was busy setting up his Zenith portable radio , a big thing , almost like a little suitcase , covered in black bumpy leather . It had the patented Wave Magnet , which was an oval plastic object the size of two dessert plates , with suction cups-this you 'd stick to the window , and there was a flat ribbonlike cable that connected it to the radio . My father had bought it specially for the trip , and we were going to hear all the usual radio programs while we crossed the country in style . My mother was leafing through a magazine , and Eloise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's expression , and what I knew about her personal tastes , I was pretty sure she was pretending she was traveling with some other family-one with no parakeets or little brothers-or maybe alone . As the train came out of the darkness of the station and into the semidarkness of the railyards on a gloomy winter afternoon , with the parakeets whirring and whizzing around the double drawing room and my family sipping 7-Up , I felt a kind of excitement I had never felt before . I knew I had begun my first big adventure . Up to now , all my adventures had been either small or completely imaginary . (
