Bill Spencer is the author of Resume with Monsters , Zod Wallop , and Irrational Fears , but around here , readers seem to remember him best for bis story about a would-be nature writer and the animals he finds , " The Essayist in the Wilderness " ( from our May 2002 issue and recently reprinted in his collection , The Ocean and All Its Devices ) . Originally from the Washington , D.C. , environs , Mr. Spencer lived in Austin , Texas , for many years . Recently he and his wife relocated to a town in Lafayette County , Missouri , where strangers on the street ask him , " So , how 's the novel coming along ? " The novel , entitled My Sister Natalie , is nearing completion . His new story was written in honor of the 2006 centennial anniversary of Robert E. Howard 's birth . He adds that , unlike the hero of this story , he has always been fascinated by the works of Marcel Proust . ( Okay , Proust and Howard-you 've been warned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wbim of circumstance . And barbarism must always ultimately triumph . " - Robert E. Howard I IN AFRICA , AGAIN HE WAS A CHILD OF SEVEN years when the Librarian 's men came for him and carried him from the small village where his father labored in the mines . They came in the afternoon , with his father away . His mother fought for him , fought until the Librarian 's soldier slew her with a single stroke of his broad axe so that all the child took with him from that day was the image of his mother sprawled on the ground , her garments in disarray , one arm flung out , fingers grotesquely clutching the dirt as though attempting to retrieve her head , bare inches beyond her reach . Bad luck for her , he thought , or later thought . He left the village forever , owning nothing but his name - and that given him by a stranger . He had acquired his name on the day of his birth , when his father , old Seamus McGarn , reeled into the pub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , McGarn called out for a beer . " Me heir has arrived ! " he shouted . " A wee stalling at the gate , but he 's here ! " Someone in the crowd yelled out , " Likely he did n't care to come into the world , seeing his inheritance . " This might , at another time , have precipitated a brawl . McGam was quick to anger and quick to use his fists , as were his fellows , for the poverty that clung to them did not teach brotherly love and tolerance but encouraged a constant Darwinian struggle . McGarn was feeling uncommonly proud and pleased to be released from the long vigil of the birthing . " He 'll be man enough to wrest a living from this blighted world , I tell you that . Fourteen pounds ! " " My God , " someone blurted . " A full stone ! " Amid laughter , he was named . Stone looked up at the hills ahead . Hundreds of birds , brown carrion feeders , flew over the green canopy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a drain . He had seen a dozen of these creatures on the plain below , a hunchbacked rabble pushing and shoving each other , snatching at the entrails of a dead antelope with much shrieking and flapping of wings . In the air they had a wind-borne grace that vanished when they touched the earth . Stone inhaled deeply . For all its dangers and grotesqueries , he loved the jungle . This primitive continent had surely saved his life and set his soul free . The wildness of these African gods , with blood on their teeth and tongues , with not an ounce of mercy to quench a prayer , had renewed him . Without Africa , the sentences might have bound him fast , might have fastened round his chest like iron bands and pressed the air from his lungs , the blood from his heart . He owed his freedom to the one called Hemingway . Not directly , of course , for the old man had killed himself in another world , another time . The Librarian had asked him who , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most , and Stone had said , " Hemingway , " although , in truth , Stone hated the lot of them , hated the way the books bred inaction , turned everything into words , the sun and the moon and the wildness of the sea and the lust for battle or for women . But he had learned that the Librarian 's questions were always to be answered . He was not suited for solitary confinement . So when the Librarian asked why , Stone answered , " He stands up . " The Librarian had not understood this , was not , perhaps , familiar with the habits of this Hemingway , and so Stone explained . " I 've read that most writers slouch in chairs as they write , and those that do n't , lie in bed scribbling away on pads of paper . Hemingway stood as he wrote . " Hemingway 's words showed this , showed a man who might walk , or run , from the words , forsaking them for the turbulent world of combat , of women , of storms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Yes . " And yet it seemed the Librarian thought Stone 's answer was a metaphor ( an honest mistake , for many of the students deemed plain-speaking contemptible ) . Stone did not disabuse him of this notion , did not say that Hemingway 's attraction lay not in his writing but in his willingness to forsake it , that the man was rightly skeptical of a vocation that harbored so many effete and degenerate types . Stone 's supposed admiration for Hemingway had lodged in the Librarian 's mind . Not six months later , the Librarian called Stone into his office and said , " What would you say to seeing that Africa your Hemingway so loved ? seeing Kilimanjaro itself . What would you say ? " Yes was what Stone would say and did , his only reservation being that he had not killed the Librarian yet and now , if he wished to secure his freedom , might never have the chance . As soon as the opportunity to leave the tour group presented itself , Stone took it and was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind . He 'd need a clear mind for the climb ahead . If the birds signified what he suspected , they would lead him to the Temple of The Librarian , held to be a myth by all those who had never been to this land and could not , as a consequence , fit their minds to its wonders . He plunged into the jungle , moving easily at first between tall trees whose smooth trunks sprang upward for a hundred feet before raising limbs to the green ceiling . Here there was little undergrowth ; light descended in long-slanted beams , light of an almost palpable density , celestial lumber propped up against the trees as though awaiting its destiny in the frame of some magnificent cathedral . Then , as die incline rose , the sense of exaltation diminished and died . The venerable giants were replaced by shorter , gnarled trees and dank explosions of vegetation with mottled and weirdly shaped leaves . Stone 's attention was drawn to a squat plant whose waxy leaves curved to form chalice-shapes filled with a pale green liquid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape , its antennae waving frantically as it sank beneath the surface . Stone turned away and pressed on . Lianas as thick as a man 's thigh blocked his path . He unsheathed his machete and began to hack his way upward through florid , steaming vegetation and stubborn thickets that were armed with long thorns , and inhabited , as every swing of the machete revealed , by angry , stinging ants . Stone proceeded with grim purpose . He would find the monster who had killed his mother and held him in long bondage . He would avenge an old wrong . As Stone went on , the incline grew steeper , and he was forced to pull himself up , gripping the smooth trunks of the trees with one massive hand while battling the undergrowth with the machete . The hours fell away as he fought the jungle . As the light of day retreated , shadows grew . Every yawning black hole that was bom in the hollow of a stone or in the cleft of a lightning-savaged tree seemed filled with red eyes and malevolent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended - abruptly - the darkness gave way to a luminous sky . Stone found himself in a clearing where tall , silver grass undulated in a fair breeze . He stood up , only now aware that his climb had necessitated a crouched and crippled posture . Above him stars glinted like knives , like assassins attending the moon . He saw the waterfall tumbling from a stone cliff and only then heard it , although it made a roar that filled the air before entering the pool with a fanfare of roiling white spray . Stone hastened to the side of the pool , where he knelt amid the lichen-mottled rocks and thrust his face toward the clear water . Small angular fish exploded from his reflection ; he drank . The water was cold with a brave taste of rock and metal . After the jungle , this place seemed a haven for gods , and Stone was tempted to spend the night here . In the morning , he would be rested and better equipped to deal with whatever awaited him . But as he lifted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water 's surface caught his eye . He reached for it . Something primal within recognized it with a thrill of revulsion . He lifted the wet , crumpled piece of ruled paper , pressed it smooth against his thigh , and read what the wretched student 's hand had wrought : GUILT IN THE SCARLET LETTER BY NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE by Harmon Perks I read The Scarlet Letter so that I could write this paper . I have picked as my theme guilt Hawthorne was interested in how guilt reacted in people . He was especially interested in this aspect with adultery which is a sin that Hester Prynne and Arthur Dimmesdale completed . Arthur Dimmesdale is a minister , so the guilt is worse and causes a " scarlet letter " to appear on his chest . This is a symbol , but it looks like a red " A " and it might not really The writer had crossed out the next two lines with angry scribbles and then written , " I hate this book I hate this book I hate this book I hate this book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this book I hate - " before crumpling the paper and hurling it into the stream . Stone uttered a powerful oath , one that he had vowed to use no more than five times in his life , honoring his mother by this frugality . He crushed the paper , his hand white-clenched as though it held an enemy 's heart , and hurled it back into the pool . Confronted by such suffering , he could not wait until morning . He turned away from the pool and the surrounding glory of the meadow and plunged back into the jungle . The darkness fought him with sharp spines , wet leaves , the resolute limbs of trees , spider webs , insects . Larger creatures followed him through the dark but did not attack , for Stone 's bulk was considerable ( he had fulfilled the promise of his birth-size ) , and no taint of fear could any beast detect , only the hot odor of rage and its hunger for release . No starlight found him in the jungle , no hint of sky , nothing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward and he followed the ache in his legs , the route that bent his back . He traveled for hours-three , by the feel of his calves . At some point , the anger engendered by the book reporter 's anguish relented , allowing Stone to regain his senses . He understood that further effort might only take him away from his goal . So he found the blasted stump of a tree , hollowed like a throne , and he brushed out a nest of blind shrews ( he recognized them by their fierce cries ) and centipedes ( their feathery feet ) , and wrapped himself in the rain poncho that bore the stamp of a warring nation two thousand miles to the north , a war whose outcome he no longer remembered . He slept and dreamed or perhaps he did not sleep and only remembered ; the images of his memory were so fragmented that they bore the look of dreams . " We come here from across time to find the ones who might save us , " the Librarian told the newly enslaved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his breath audible . The students sat in hushed rows as the monitors moved down the aisles with supple wands capable of raising a welt . As always , the Librarian was dressed in the same uniform the students wore . When Stone was a child , new to Knowledge Base #29 , he thought nothing of this , but later he realized it was an affectation of humility where no genuine humility existed , for the old man was thin and sharpfeatured , and his uniform was precisely tailored , creating an impression of elegance without extravagance . Those uniforms worn by the students were another thing entirely . They were made of some shoddy material , gray and shapeless as rags , the pants wide and overly long , inducing a loutish shuffle . The Librarian told them , again and again , that they were the hope of the future . He told them that he was from a future that was in need of hope , for the greatness of Mankind resided in its knowledge . In that future that was the Librarian 's present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all history had been blown into smoke by some dark magic . Stone thought , What is it worth if a sorcerer can banish it to oblivion ? But the Librarian went on , as he always did . In the two months since his capture , Stone had already heard the story six times in its fullness , and every morning began with a shorter version as he and his classmates sang " Lost Glory " ( " Our grandeur mourning , we watch a savage dawn unfolding " ) . There was no forgetting that civilization was gone . " I do n't miss it , " Stone told Lars Stoker , who immediately ran off and repeated that heresy to one of the headmasters , who came and punished Stone with some perfunctory swats . The long and the short of it was this : what knowledge remained had wound up in books , those archaic rectangles of pulped wood . With those the world would be reborn to knowledge . " My dad 's gon na get me out of here , " Stone told Lars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dad was here . I heard - " " He ai n't . " " Well , he wo n't find you . Could n't find you with a dozen bloodhounds . " " Why 's that ? " In truth , Stone doubted his dad would look much for him . They had never gotten along . " This here school moves around . It 's what you call mobile . Sliding in and out of space . " " Who told you that ? " " Nobody . But everybody knows it 's so . Just look out the window , why do n't ya ? One day you got snow falling down on a lot of piney trees and the next day you got a alley full of garbage and cats . How do you explain that ? " Stone did n't try . He hit Lars with his fist , a good whack to the temple , and when Lars came around Stone said , " Go tell one of the headmasters I smacked you . You do that , and I 'll smack you so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of telling headmasters anything . " The logic of this was not lost on Lars . One time Stone was reading about some made-up person who was wrestling and wrestling with his conscience because he 'd killed somebody and could n't make up his mind whether he should tell someone about it or not when any idiot with half a brain would know , with no thought at all , that telling was not a good idea and would only end in grief . In a room of desks and half-dozing students , Stone turned the book face down , thinking , not for the first time , If we are going to get knowledge , why ca n't wehave more of the science andhow-to knowledge and less of this literature ? But he knew the answer because it was another thing the Librarian went on about at every single rally and every single orientation . " It was n't , " the Librarian would boom over the speakers , " the lack of science that led to the end . " It was the absence of compassion , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization to its knees . So what needed to be stressed in this bunker where the flame of civilization burned with a small , hopeful light was knowledge of the heart . And where were you going to find that ? In literature , of course ! Stone would have given a lot to trade Crime and Punishment for a book on how to make a small bomb using only kitchen and bathroom supplies . There was knowledge going dying in the world for want of attention , and Stone felt for it . IN THE MORNING a band of monkeys woke Stone , shouting and leaping from branch to branch . They were overly pleased with their agility and sought to taunt Stone , who threw a net over the closest imp and , as it fought to untangle itself , screaming like a banshee , silenced it with his knife . Stone was always in a black humor in the morning , and hungry to boot . He made a small fire , rousing it with a flint . He carried spices with him , and these he rubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve the taste or Stone 's mood . He recalled that in Zaruba he had heard a tribesman describe the ancient chief there as a man with " no more savor than a Bakalu . " The chief had been a very old man covered in dust ( whether by design or happenstance , Stone never discovered ) . Stone decided that he had just eaten a monkey of the Bakalu family . He climbed the tallest tree and looked about him . The sun was out and already well-risen . He had slept later than was his wont , but that was one of his freedoms ; he moved to no clock but his own . He could see mountains in the far distance , bare stone wreathed in clouds . By his reckoning , the temple , if it had not been magicked away , was three or four hours " march ahead . As he watched , a flock of yellow butterflies floated over the trees , moving with a jaunty motion as though animated by music only they could hear . Then two loud explosions from below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds flew out of the jungle , uttering their squawks and dirge-like cries . So they aie already shooing them off for the day , thought Stone . He fumbled in the pocket of his fatigues and produced the small gem that old N'Loopa had given him when they had both fought the wizard Mesu Pork , and he held the gem up to the light . Within it a red liquid flowed , always seeking the west , and by this he adjusted his course . His travel during the night had not been in vain , he was barely an hour from his destination . II THE TEMPLE OF THE LIBRARIAN He spied the golden domes and turrets and strangely angled walls long before the whole of the building came into view . In fact , it could be said that the whole building never did present itself to his eye , for the temple stretched out and back and into the jungle so that its limits were not easily apparent . Indeed , Stone could not tell if it were a single building or a collection of buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gray brick and stolidly drab . The ornate structure he now beheld could only be a thing of Africa , brown and gold and shining and somehow of the earth , bathed in the blood and dust of this savage land . Stone did not doubt that mountains of bones lay beneath this labyrinthine structure . It might now be the refuge of the Librarian , but it had been raised by an older race . Despite its remote location , Stone assumed the temple would have guards and perhaps sophisticated instruments for spying out intruders . He proceeded carefully , remaining within the trees and tangled vegetation that came within fifty feet of the walls of the temple . Another explosion chased more of the brown , ungainly scavengers into the air . They were to Stone 's right , coming up over a red and brown domed roof . One of the birds landed clumsily in the branch of a tree just thirty feet to Stone 's right . They did n't scare far , these creatures , being fearless or , more likely , addled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the building , staying in the shadows and moving cautiously , always assuming that someone or something watched . He saw them then . A familiar revulsion , a sense of suffocation , rolled over him , as though he were imprisoned again in their company . The green , gentle hill with its well-manicured pass and tamed fruit trees was littered with the bodies of students . Not a one of them moved . They sprawled , leaned against trees , sat with their knees crossed , and all of them were studying . Books held them in thrall , eyes were willed to pages . The students were of both sexes , sometimes together , but always locked in separate trances as though this learning , this literature , exuded mind-killing vapors that immobilized its victims . The frenzy in the loins to mate , even this proud imperative , the progenitor of wars and fine heroic deeds , was stilled by the paralysis of study . This was death 's image , even if the breath still stirred within . Was n't it enough to fool the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guns when the birds proved too bold , would the birds move yet closer ... and feed ? The mere proximity of these students chilled his limbs . A wave of nausea overcame him , as though a powerful vertigo spell had found its mark , and he remembered the dreaded books . " Callmelshmael , " one book began . Not a hundred pages through and dead sick of whales , Stone called the writer many things , " long-winded " being the least of them . But you were n't allowed to call it quits . They devised tests to see if you had truly read the thing , with solitary confinement awaiting those who failed . Damnable books : The Iliad , Silas Monter , Vanity Fair .... The thought of Thackeray .. . Stone almost blacked out . Sometimes Stone would have a vision of an old man lying in bed , eating chocolates from a box , obese and in failing health , and talking and talking , occasionally shaking an admonitory finger , smiling or frowning , lecturing , unaware that everyone had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A book was an old man , impotent and raging , or , worse , self-doting beyond madness , a prattling assertion of ego . Sometimes , in the years of his imprisonment , Stone broke away from slumber in a blazing fever , grabbed from the nightstand something by one of the infamous Jameses ( Henry or Joyce ) , flipped wildly through the pages - and , full of dizzy revelation , saw precisely what the writer was getting at . He would jump up and run down the halls , banging on doors , awakening his fellow students . Waving the book in the face of some sleep-dazed wretch , he would explain . Yes . He would explain until someone roused the house monitor and a couple of orderlies were summoned . They would tackle and sedate him . " Nonsense , " Lars Stoker told him on the morning after one such episode . " Were n't even words you were saying , just gibberish like . " " ' Gibberish ? ' " " Yeah , you know , like bibble bleep bah jabber ho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush , that sense of having finally got it . Alas , it was a delusion , for when he revisited a book that made no sense prior to the episode , it was , again , an implacable wall . After one such episode , he reopened the Faulkner that had been the catalyst for his derangement and found it as impenetrable as ever . He might as well try to puzzle out the thought processes of a giant squid mulling things over at the lottom of the night-black sea . And he had thought he understood1 . He ro ired with laughter , laughter so violent that it convulsed his body . He broke out of his restraints and ran down the hall , smashing through to the adjoining ward where suicidal young women who had recently read The Bell far moped around like swamp wraiths . It had taken five orderlies to subdue him . Now was not the time for indulging the past . The students , the carefully composed lawn , the massive walls of the temple , all seemed to urge passivity , another name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placement of guards , he could not wait . To remain here would be to surrender to inaction , perhaps to never move again . He moved . With the speed and agility that had kept him whole among jungle and desert predators ( including the human ones ) , Stone raced over the grass and reached the wall , releasing the grappling rope from his waist even as he ran , and threw the grappling hook high where it caught on the lip of an ornate ledge . To anyone watching , it might seem that he ran up the wall and disappeared by supernatural means . In fact , as soon as he found the roof he threw his poncho around him , and the poncho , made for a desert war ( made as a hammer is made to recognize a nail ) , turned itself the mottled red and brown of the roof . Under this camouflage , Stone crouched and ran to a small domed shed that protruded from the roof . Above him , he spied three evenly spaced watchtowers , each containing the tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver weapon . The door to the shed was locked , but no match for Stone 's resolution and the thick sinews of his arms . It was dark within . Stone descended a short flight of stairs and discovered a large storage space filled with casks , crates , armor , rusting weapons of mass destruction , and boxes filled with books and ammunition . Stone 's mercenary days had taught him the look of fine weapons . Here , hanging from the stone wall , was a silver sword of great beauty and strength . He lifted it from the wall . When he pushed the button at its base , the blade seemed to shimmer , an illusion created by twin blades moving with uncanny speed . This was a sword to cut through stone and steel and bone . He made his way to the end of the room where yet another door awaited him . This door opened on a long corridor illuminated by dozens of brass torches that simulated fire . Moving quickly down the hallway , he heard voices to his right and moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and almost immediately the owners of the voices rounded a comer and came into view . He saw a teacher , dressed in traditional garb , a tweed jacket , elbow patches that signified thoughtfulness ( thought required considerable leaning on the elbows ) , and an ill-groomed beard , brown and flecked with silver , which some called - it was all coming back to Stone - a tenure . The man was accompanied by five students , two male and three female , who stayed very close to him , almost hugging him , and bent low , a posture that allowed them to look upward into the face of their mentor who was short and yet , by his station , demanded upward gazes . Spying Stone , they all stopped abruptly , gone mute until one of their group , a beardless boy , spoke , " Who 's this , Professor ? " " I have no idea , " the professor said , frowning . " He 's not a level two , so he has no business here . Where is your uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a leper in Wantoga , " Stone said . " Had he not been naked , he would have refused the gift , I 'm sure . " " What 's your name ? " " Stone . And yours ? " The professor smiled , turning slowly so his students could read his amusement . " Well , this fellow is grilling me like a first year , is n't he ? " The students giggled , and the professor , easily encouraged , began to recite a cynical , archly insulting poem . That is , Stone took the poem for an insult , but there was no way he could know for sure . He could never know what lay within a poem . The runic words , the incarnatory rhythm , seemed a threat filled with sorcerer 's guile . A blinding red haze filled his eyes - this had always been so - as the madness of the warrior rose up . He leaned forward and sank the humming blade deep into the man 's heart . Stone looked at the balding academic , lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accusation ( You 've killed a feeble foe ! ) , and thought , He should n't have poemed me . The students fled down the hall . Instantly , Stone was restored to his senses . A loud ringing filled the halls , the same ringing that used to send every student into the pavilion back at Knowledge Base #29 . Stone felt a need to go outside and stand in a line , but he was pleased to discover that this old imprinting no longer ruled him . He turned and ran in the other direction , spied a door on his right and wrenched it open . He ran quickly up the stairs . The Librarian would be above him . The old man loved a view , loved to sweep his hands before a window as though petitioning the world , and he would be up there in some high vaulted room , up there minding the clouds . Finally , Stone came to the topmost step and broke in another door . More than a dozen armed guards , bristling with swords , greeted him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - formidable brutes , but not , Stone thought , bound by loyalty . He knew the mercenary 's eye , having lived among them , and for all their love of money , they loved their own blood more and would bolt if the work of killing cost too much of their own red stuff . " Good then ! " Stone shouted . " Your numbers tell me that something of value must be lodged behind that door ! Some treasure ? Your master , I think . " He moved into them with a roar , his humming sword low . He crouched , lunged , moving with such speed that the gleam of his blade left a shining cross in the air , a swordsman 's benediction . Stone stepped over the fallen bodies . Others filled the void immediately and died as quickly . Shouts and imprecations thundered in the hall . Stone 's foes pressed forward with howling determination , thinking to overcome him with numbers , but their swords broke on his spinning one , and the swords that breached Stone 's defenses ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( made from the hides of sentient lizards from the distant planet Celicus , where they basked and rolled in fire as cats will yawn and stretch in a sunbeam ) . As Stone had guessed-no , it was a certainty ! - they turned and fled . With a wan smile , Stone watched the last of them round the corner . They could have killed him with their numbers , but each of them could not count past himself , an army of one , no army that . THIS LAST DOOR would not be broken into by brute force . This Stone knew , but he had not come unprepared . He removed the gem that his old friend N'Loopa had given him , hearing again his old friend 's words , " This be seek rock , some say Eye of Old Cod called sometimes Abathoth . Can find your way on journey , sure , but more more power too . Find man or woman 's heart . Find lost thing . Find hidden thing . " Stone held the gem up to the door , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridor . The gem cast an eerie , greenish light that uncovered what cunning spells sought to conceal from human eyes . Upon the door , strange runes were drawn in a square , and , as Stone looked on , one symbol grew brighter , then faded as another underwent the same transformation , dark to bright then dark again . Some primal voice spoke to Stone without words , without sound . Stone knew what to do . He leaned forward and touched each symbol as it shone . When the cycle had completed , the door swung open silently . Stone entered the room with his sword held high . The Librarian was motionless , slumped forward on his desk , a small lamp illuminating his bald pate . Stone thought to slay him in his sleep . The old man 's power and cunning were not to be underestimated . And the advantage of surprise was not to be traded for some misguided notion of fair play . Even as Stone thought this , the Librarian looked up . " Son , " the Librarian said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you been ? " Stone spoke , undaunted : " I have been many places . I have fought and reveled in lands beyond Atlantis and Mu , beyond the reach of your assassins . I have stood under a midnight sky where three moons illuminated the naked daughters of Lenthe , Goddess of Lust , as they danced their lascivious dances and fought for my seed . " The Librarian sighed . " Your mother went to bed in tears . I told her I 'd wait up . " " My mother was killed by your minions when I was just a child . And I am no son of yours . I doubt my father is alive , for - " " Yes , the mines of that small village you grew up in are dangerous . " The Librarian shook his head , expressing fatigue , disgust . " It was a simple field trip to the Museum of Natural History , Edward . Mr. Miller was extremely upset when he discovered you 'd slipped away from the group . I assured him that it has happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't keep your mother from hysterics . I finally talked her into taking a sedative . " " My mother is dead , " Stone said . " And I have had enough of your words . " The Librarian smiled . " Do you intend to hit me with that umbrella , Edward ? " Stone 's eyes rose slowly to his clenched hand . The sword was gone-and in his hand , instead : a thin black umbrella ! Stone felt the strength go out of him . The blue smoke that encircled him was not , as he had foolishly assumed , the familiar effluvium produced by the Librarian 's pipe . No , this was some insidious vapor that distorted - And then that thought was gone , and Stone lost consciousness before the floor smote his forehead . III REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST He went to the classes and returned to his room . How long he had done this , he did not know . " I think I 'm overmedicated , " he told the school 's physician , who nodded and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dosage , but for now .... " He shrugged . " Better safe than sorry . " They called him Edward , a name he hated . " Call me , Ed , okay ? " he said . So his fellow students called him Ed . His teachers insisted on Edward , to taunt him , he assumed . This day he lay on the bed and opened the new novel they had assigned him . At least , he thought , it 's a short one . It was about some teenager named Holden . It was " written " by Holden , although it was n't really written by him . There was a writer out there who had really written the book , pretending to be Holden . Ed hated this , hated the levels of the lie , the depth of dissembling . In the novel , this Holden kid calls everyone a " phony , " and complains about everything and does n't do much of anything , just drifts around , and talks about how he 'd like to be the one who stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cliff . This imaginary teenager 's imaginary job would be to grab a kid up if he strayed too near the cliff 's edge . Only : Why have children playing in such a dangerous place just so you could be a hero ? Ed thought Holden was a silly , coddled creature . But Holden was n't real , was as blameless as the air . The person responsible for Holden 's inflated ego and miserable personality was this Salinger who wrote the book , this fool , this writer , making a voice in his head , imitating the accent , the gestures , the slouch , imagining this whiny teenager . Ed could n't exactly explain why this was so enraging . This Holden Caulfield was a worthless waste of time , and that was bad enough , but it seemed a thousand times worse that someone had intentionally brought Holden to life . What an abomination : a listless author giving birth to a listless teenager ! That night Ed tossed and turned in his sleep and was harried by fantastical dreams that he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the morning , he resolved to stop taking his pills . He went to a drugstore on Livingston and bought a bottle of vitamin C pills that were white , oval shapes - just like the pills he swallowed each morning . He poured these pills into a plastic sandwich bag and walked down to the medical annex where Nurse Werther was drinking coffee and watching the news on the overhead television . She sighed the way she always did when anyone interrupted her , as though she was n't being paid to dispense medications but did it out of the goodness of her heart , despite the ingratitude of those she served . When she came back with the pill bottle , Ed pretended to stumble . He grabbed at the table to right himself , and Nurse Werther ' 8 coffee went over . " Shaw ! " she shouted . As she ran off to get a paper towel , Ed grabbed the bottle , turned away from the retreating nurse , opened the bottle and poured its contents into his left pocket . Another few seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the bottle and screwed the cap back on . Nurse Werther had n't returned . When she did , and when she had finished mopping up the spilled coffee while sighing copiously , she watched Ed take his pill . Tomorrow and the next day and the next day , he would dutifully come in and take his vitamin C. Three weeks later , Ed finished the obligatory book report . His report began , " If I metHolden Caulfield in an alley , I would kill him with a rock , " but he did n't hand that one in . He did n't want trouble . So he pretended he was one of the prissy girls in the class , and he wrote about how much he liked the book , and he used the word " alienation " because that was his teacher 's favorite word that month . He went to classes . Time turned the color of a rain-laden sky . When people called him Edward , it did n't bother him so much . " Many people consider this the greatest novel of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward thought . He was in a different part of the university now , and here the level of complexity was deeper . Many of his fellow students never finished a sentence , so besieged were they by elaborate , subtle thoughts . At least I do n't have to read it in French , he thought , as he studied Volume 1 , which contained four novels , the first half of this imposing masterpiece . He flipped through the pages of the book . There were 1,141 of them . Many pages were flat blocks of small type with no indentions , no paragraphs . The translator was a man named C. K. Scott Moncrieff , and Edward wondered if that was a pseudonym but realized he did n't really care . With trepidation that was immediately validated , he began reading the first paragraph : For a long time I used to go to bed early . Sometimes , when I had put out my candle , my eyes would close so quickly that I had not even time to say , " I 'm going to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt dull and heavy . His eyes traveled over several sentences before his attention kicked in again : ... Then it would begin to seem unintelligible , as the thoughts of a former existence must be to a reincarnate spirit ; the subject of my book would separate itself from me , leaving me free to choose whether I would form part of it or no ; and at the same time my sight would return and I would be astonished to find myself in a state of darkness , pleasant and restful enough for the eyes , and even more , perhaps , for my mind , to which it appeared incomprehensible , without a cause , a matter dark indeed . Edward read on . No one had to tell him that this Proust guy wrote while lying down . The convoluted sentences induced a fever state that destroyed his sense of time . Edward stopped attending classes , but in this crowded university , away from the usual parental supervision , his absence was not noted , and he did manage to drop by the medical annex for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise an alarm . He was free to dream . He lost all sense of the convoluted sentences , and they began to devour him . He could make no clear distinction between reading and staring at the ceiling . He had heard other students speak of this lack of clarity , the way the sinuous thoughts would turn to sounds , cadences that induced trance states . He thought he might die , but felt no sense of fear . He was interested only in describing this state with the longest sentence he could fashion . He had n't eaten in days , peihaps weeks . Could one not eat for weeks ? He stumbled toward the bed and fell . He grabbed an end table to steady himself , but it accompanied him downward , and a drawer fell out , tumbling as it fell . The bottom of the drawer was revealed , and on it , lashed with silver tape , was a book . Edward peeled away the tape and studied the book , a paperback . The end table , which he had brought from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been affixed to its hiding place long ago . He thought he remembered it , remembered reading it surreptitiously , late at night , the way one might remember eating a crumpet with some tea in some long ago past . He studied its garish cover , an oil painting of massive cavemen marching out of the mist of some brutal prehistoric dawn . A pale white woman is draped over the gigantic shoulder of one such brute . She is as white , whiter , than the moon above . She is naked . Edward lay on the bed reading the book . Halfway through the first story , a sharp knife stabbed his stomach . He identified the knife : hunger . He ate the cheese and ham in the refrigerator , washing it down with six or seven beers . He ate a loaf of bread . He had bought these groceries some time ago . There may have been mold growing on some of the items , but he did not care . He was not fastidious . He slept soundly and was roughly awakened by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're alive , " the man said . He was a big man , and his eyes burned with impatience . " Who are you ? " Edward asked . " You know , " the man said , and Edward was surprised to discover that he did know . This was the man who had made the sentences his slaves and so escaped the dust and tedium of West Texas . " They said you were dead . " " They would say that , would n't they ? " Of course they would ! The man leaned closer , his eyes solemn , intense . " The real question , " he said , " is who are you ? " Edward would have said he did n't know , but the answer was on his tongue when he opened his mouth . " Stone . " The man nodded and turned away . " I 've taken the liberty of breaking this window . You 're a sound sleeper . " He waited , as though Stone might want to refute this . Stone said nothing - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave without attracting attention . " Then the man was in the window , a silhouette , and then he was gone . Without hesitation , Stone followed , leaping into the night , the star-bright air roaring in his ears Iike the welcoming roar of a vast crowd . The soles of his shoes slapped down on the asphalt parking lot ; he stumbled forward , but he did not fall . He looked around at the campus , the rows of stark winter trees against the mist-enshrouded lamps , the stately admin building to his right , dormitories one through eight receding in the distance like some trick of a mirror or too much to drink . " Come on ! " the man shouted . He was on down the path ; another ten feet and he would disappear behind the tall evergreens that lined Burroughs Way . He raised his arm , and described an urgent arc . " Come on ! " he shouted . " We 'll be safe once we reach the jungle ! " And Stone knew he was right .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
