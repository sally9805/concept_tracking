Introduction I AM NO FAN OF BOOKS . AND CHANCES ARE , IF YOU 'RE READING THIS , YOU AND I SHARE A HEALTHY SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE PRINTED WORD . WELL , I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK I 'VE EVER WRITTEN , AND I HOPE IT 'S THE FIRST BOOK YOU 'VE EVER READ . DO N'T MAKE A HABIT OF IT . // How many American Flags can you find in this paragraph ? // Now , you might ask yourself , if by yourself you mean me , " Stephen , if you do n't like books , why did you write one ? " You just asked yourself a trick question . I did n't write it . I dictated it . I shouted it into a tape recorder over the Columbus Day weekend , then handed it to my agent and said , " Sell this . " He 's the one who turned it into a book . It 's his funeral . // But I get your " drift . " Why even dictate ? // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one man 's opinion I value above all others . Mine . And folks , I have a lot of opinions . I 'm like Lucy trying to keep up with the candy at the chocolate factory . I can barely put them in my mouth fast enough . // In fact , I have so many opinions , I have overwhelmed my ability to document myself . I thought my nightly broadcast , The Colbert Report ( check your local listings ) , would pick up some of the slack . But here 's the dirty little secret . When the cameras go off , I 'm still talking . And right now all that opinion is going to waste , like seed on barren ground . Well no more . It 's time to impregnate this country with my mind . // Sorry margin-huggers , but I 've got some opinions over here , too . Deal with it . // See , at one time America was pure . Men were men , women were women , and gays were " confirmed bachelors . " But somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to " let it all hang out " while you " kept on truckin ' " stopping only to " give a hoot . " And today , Lady Liberty is under attack from the cable channels , the internet blogs , and the Hollywood celebritocracy , out there spewing " facts " like so many locusts descending on America 's crop of ripe , tender values . And as any farmer or biblical scholar will tell you , locusts are damn hard to get rid of . // You will need your confirmation number to log in // I said on the very first episode of The Colbert Report that , together , I was going to change the world , and I 've kept up my end of the bargain . But it 's not changing fast enough . Last time I checked my supermarket still sold yogurt . From France ! See a pattern ? Turns out , it takes more than thirty minutes a night to fix everything that 's destroying America , and that 's where this book comes in . It 's not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the coward 's way out . // Half an hour not enough // This book is Truth . My Truth . // I deliver my Truth hot and hard . Fast and Furious . So either accept it without hesitation or get out of the way , because somebody might get hurt , and it 's not going to be me. // It 's going to be you // Think you can handle it ? // I 'm scared of Koreans . // Bam ! That 's me off the cuff . Blunt and in your face . No editing . I think it . I say it . You read it . Sometimes I do n't even think it , I just say it . // Baby carrots are trying to turn me gay . // Do n't put this book down // See ? I 'm not pulling any punches . I 'm telling it like it is . Get used to it or put this book down . Because this book is for America 's Heroes . And who are the Heroes ? The people who bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this book are not Heroes . They are no better then welfare queens mooching off the system like card-carrying library card-carriers . For the record , we 're not offering this book to libraries . No free rides . // Rides cost money // Okay , now it 's my turn to ask a question : What do I want from you ? Good question . // Thank you // Just because I have n't put a lot of thought into this book does n't mean you should n't . I want you to read this book carefully . Savor my ideas . Memorize pertinent passages . Eat with it , sleep with it , let nature take its course . // Because what I have dictated is nothing less than a Constitution for the Colbert Nation . And , like our Founding Fathers , I hold my Truths to be self-evident , which is why I did absolutely no research . // I did n't need to . The only research I needed was a long hard look in the mirror . For this book is My Story and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minus the Fruited Plains . ( See Chapter 7-Homosexuals ) // I am reminded of the words of Walt Whitman , the nineteenth-century poet , naturalist , and all around man 's man , who , through his epic lyricism , defined the character of this new nation . He said , // " I celebrate myself , and sing myself , And what I assume , you shall assume . " // That " I " he was talking about ? It 's me. // Bottom line : Read this book . Be me. // I Am America ( And So Can You ! ) // by Stephen Colbert //
