In the future , everyone will be famous for $15,000 . WITH the emergence of a whole industry devoted to re-creating celebrity culture for anyone who can afford it , fame is a commodity like any other , although it 's true that no matter how much you spend , you 'll probably sacrifice your dignity as well . <P> Actually , $15,000 is a lowball estimate , since that would barely cover the event-space rental tab for the kind of lavish spectacles that have become prime-time fare on MTV 's highly rated My Super Sweet 16 . The show documents the excesses of privileged youths commemorating the mighty achievement of making it through their 16th year . Shell-shocked parents  --  always uttering the mantra " It was worth it "  --  typically peel off checks for upwards of $200,000 . We learn that from the Sun Belt to Erie , Pa. , the lack of taste knows no ethnic , religious or cultural bounds . You give teenagers $200,000 , and they will spend it exactly as you would expect . The parties are the aesthetic equivalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming-of-age rituals . A child is inducted into the adult realm through a transformative experience , whether it 's becoming more steeped in religion or killing a deer or having a vision . It 's true that I would be happy to send any of the children of My Super Sweet 16 into the desert by themselves for a while . Their blingy flings are not celebrations of accomplishment ; they 're celebrations of self . What used to mark the end of childhood now seems only an excuse to prolong the whiny , self-centered greediness that gives infantile a bad name . Far from joining polite society like the debutants of the past , the kids gleefully rip through social graces , alienating friends and sacrificing tact all in the name of creating a VIP room filled with people too young to drive themselves home . <P> The protagonists ' excesses alone make for lurid , enjoyably outraged viewing . ( Surely one celebrant 's decision to dye her poodles pink should have prompted a call to the A.S.P.C.A. ) A precocious celebutant makes her entrance via helicopter . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rents out the mall to stage a faux fashion show ( prompting a backstage catfight over a limited supply of bustiers ) . There are hired dancers , a raj-like litter hoisted by hand-picked hotties and an apparent contractual obligation for someone to arrive in a stretch Hummer . I had no idea so many stretch Hummers even existed . No wonder we had to go to war in Iraq .
