She 's breathtakingly beautiful . Morning light fills the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria stirs , and opens her eyes . She stretches contentedly . <p> Then she frowns . Rolls over . She 's alone in the bed ? <p> No , she 's not : PETER ( 20s ) sits on the edge , his back to her . Two fresh , steaming mugs of coffee sit on a tray near him . <p> # MARIA # Hey . Are you okay ? <p> Peter does n't turn . He slowly stands and walks forward towards an OPEN WINDOW . <p> There 's something strange about the way he moves  --  stiffly , almost jerkily , straining his joints and muscles . <p> Maria gets out of bed , concerned . <p> # MARIA # Peter ? What 's the matter ? <p> He pauses at the window . Turns his head to look back at her . <p> His eyes are vacant . His face is a blank . <p> Then Peter slowly leans forward . And falls from the window . <p> Maria stands in shock as the sound of SCREECHING TIRES from outside reaches her ears . Then SCREAMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manages to numbly walk forward , towards the window . We MOVE PAST her and TILT DOWN TO REVEAL  --  <p>  --  PETER 'S BODY lies in the middle of the street . His head has burst open , his body broken and twisted . <p> ON THE PAVEMENT : a line of blood appears , moving down the center of the screen . As if hitting grooves we can not see  --  <p>  --  the blood slowly forms the shape of two KANJI CHARACTERS . A translation appears over them : " The Grudge . " <p> 2 EXT . STREET CORNER - DAY 2 <p> A blur of movement as hundreds of people stream up from a subway tunnel . Most are Japanese . We 're not in Kansas . <p> Standing in the middle of the rush-hour pedestrian traffic is <p> KAREN ( 20s , American ) . She faces upstream , looking for someone . The flow threatens to carry her away in a heartbeat . She looks fragile , intimidated by the madness . <p> DOUG ( O.S. ) Karen ! <p> She turns to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a reassuring smile he takes her hand  --  <p>  --  and together , they force their way through the throng , trying to escape the flow . They 're jostled and crushed by the crowd , and Doug protectively pulls Karen closer . <p> # KAREN # I 'll never get used to this . <p> # DOUG # Maybe we should find a different train station . <p> He abruptly stops , right in the middle of traffic , still holding Karen 's hand . She turns , wondering what 's going on . She sees the smile on his lips a moment before  --  <p>  --  he sweeps Karen into his arms and kisses her . As if the crowd of businessmen surging around them is n't there at all . <p> It 's tender and loving , and she responds ... at first . But then she pulls away , shy . <p> # KAREN # A public display of affection is considered rude in Japan . <p> There 's an opening ahead into a SIDE STREET . Doug and Karen deftly slip out of the traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STREET - DAY 2b <p>  --  and walk hand-in-hand down the much quieter street , away from the crowded thoroughfare . <p> Doug smiles as they pass by two JAPANESE HIGH SCHOOL COUPLES , making out on the street corner . He turns to give Karen a sarcastic look  --  <p>  --  but she did n't notice the school kids . She 's looking in the other direction , at a trickle of SMOKE wafting up over a nearby fence . <p> # KAREN # What 's that ? <p> Doug follows as she walks toward an OLD TEMPLE , nestled beneath a skyscraper . A collision of the ancient and modern . The fence surrounds a GRAVEYARD adjacent to the temple . <p> # DOUG # We walk past this temple every day , Karen  --  <p> # KAREN # Yeah , but I 've never seen this before . <p> A JAPANESE MAN stands before an ornate headstone , lighting a bundle of incense and bowing before the grave . <p> # KAREN # It 's a Buddhist ritual . The incense smoke carries the prayers to the spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> CLINK . She turns as Doug , grinning , lights a cigarette with his Zippo , flicking it shut and pocketing it . <p> # DOUG # It 's amazing . You 're like this infinite storehouse of wisdom . Or trivia . I 'm not sure which . <p> # KAREN # It 's not trivia . It 's what they believe . And it 's far better , by the way , than your little pollution ritual . <p> Doug 's grin softens to a smile . He does n't respond ... but the way he 's looking at Karen makes her curious : <p> # KAREN # What ? <p> He turns away for a moment , almost shyly , dropping his cigarette and crushing it . Finally : <p> # DOUG # Nothing . I just  --  I like that about you . You seem to be able to remember everything that 's really important . <p> She smiles . A tender moment . Then ... he checks his watch . <p> # DOUG # Except the time . <p> Karen checks her own watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  <p> She grabs his hand and starts to walk quickly . <p> # KAREN # C'm on , you 're gon na be late . <p> 2c EXT . CAMPUS - DAY 2c <p> An international college in Tokyo . The autumn chill does n't deter the students from enjoying the beautiful day . <p> Karen and Doug , still holding hands , enter the campus . <p> 2cc EXT . NURSING CARE CENTER - DAY 2cc <p> Karen and Doug approach the doors of a NURSING CARE CENTER . She pulls him to the side just as he 's stepping under a WORKMAN 'S LADDER by the doors . <p> # KAREN # Uh-uh . Seven years of bad luck . ( before Doug can respond : ) And I might have a vested interest in those years . <p> # DOUG # Is that right ? <p> # KAREN # Maybe . <p> Doug smiles , kissing her romantically . Then : <p> # DOUG # Will I see you tonight ? <p> # KAREN # I 'll call you when I get home . <p> With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> # DOUG # Fourteen . I hate odd numbers . <p> 2d INT . NURSING CARE CENTER - DAY 2d <p> Through the front doors , we see Doug kiss Karen again . They finally separate , and Doug walks off . <p> Then Karen walks through the doors into a bright , atrium-like lobby area . She waves " hello " to the RECEPTIONIST . <p> Leaning against a desk behind Reception is Karen 's boss ALEX ( 40s , American ) . He 's got a phone to his ear  --  it 's ringing . An ANSWERING MACHINE picks up in Japanese . <p> Alex mutters and hangs up . Then he notices  --  <p> # ALEX # Karen ! <p> She 's started up a STAIRCASE in the center of the lobby . She turns and comes back down , walking over to Alex . <p> # ALEX # Are you free this afternoon ? <p> # KAREN # I just came by to pick up some books I left here . I 'm not scheduled to work today  --  <p> # ALEX # I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> # KAREN # ( shaking her head : ) Just a test to study for . Why ? <p> Alex smiles , holding out a file . <p> # ALEX # Your wish has been granted . <p> Karen takes the file and opens it , looking at the first page - - a picture of an OLDER WOMAN ( EMMA ) is attached . <p> # ALEX # It 's Yoko 's case , but she did n't show up for work this morning , and I ca n't reach her at home . She must be sick , or something . And she has the damn house key . <p> Studying the file , Karen squints . <p> # KAREN # What 's this phrase ? <p> # ALEX # " Mild dementia with severe lethargy . " Apparently she sleeps through most of the day . Her daughter-in-law does n't work , so she 'll probably be there . <p> Karen seems unsure . It 's a big step for her . <p> # ALEX # You 're the one who 's been bugging me about getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an English-only house . <p> One of Alex 's CO-WORKERS appears in the doorway , motioning to him . Alex quickly hands Karen a card : <p> # ALEX # Here 's the address . Use the wall chart if you need help  --  and do n't forget to bring a map . <p> Karen looks at THE ADDRESS  --  a string of thirty numbers and Japanese characters . She glances up at <p> THE WALL CHART : a color-coded diagram shows how the long address string is broken down into Postal Code , Prefecture , City , Ward , District , Block , Sub-Block and House Number . <p> # ALEX # Do n't worry Karen , you 're ready . <p> Karen nods . But she 's not quite as confident . <p> 3 OMITTED 3 <p> 4 OMITTED 4 <p> 4a INT . RAIL STATION - DAY 4a <p> People rush madly around Karen as she studies A LARGE MAP on the wall . It 's the Tokyo rail system  --  daunting , at best . <p> 4b OMITTED 4b <p> 4bb INT . TRAIN - DAY 4bb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeezed in tightly by the people around her . The LOUD CRYING of a baby adds to her discomfort . <p> 5 EXT . RAIL PLATFORM - DAY 5 <p> The transit car pulls to a stop and a handful of people get out . Karen is one of them , shouldering her backpack . <p> 5a EXT . SHOPPING DISTRICT - DAY 5a <p> Karen walks down the populated sidewalk , weaving through STREET VENDORS , and passing a large GROCERY STORE . <p> She pauses , looking at the address on her card . She approaches a WOMAN and her DAUGHTER ( 6 ) and speaks to them in Japanese . The woman nods , pointing towards a small ALLEY . <p> Karen gives the daughter a smile ; the girl hides behind her mother 's leg . <p> 6 EXT . TOKYO NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 6 <p> Karen exits the alley , entering a quiet , narrow street . She 's still not sure if she 's in the right place . <p> But then her eyes fix on something . She begins to walk towards it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE HOUSE - DAY 6a <p>  --  it 's THE HOUSE . Cozy and shaded , nestled into the dead end of the street . Large by Tokyo standards . <p> She double-checks the address and opens the gate , walking around a BICYCLE leaning against the wall and following the stepping-stone path to the front door . She knocks . No answer . She tries again . Nothing . <p> Then , an afterthought , she tries the handle . It 's unlocked . <p> 7 INT . THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - DAY 7 <p> Karen pokes her head inside the genkan ( entry hall ) . <p> # KAREN # Hello ? Mrs. Williams ? <p> Nothing . She tentatively steps inside , and the door closes behind her . It 's dark and musty  --  the blinds are drawn . <p> # KAREN # Is anyone here ? <p> She turns and LOCKS THE FRONT DOOR . <p> 8 INT . THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 8 <p> Karen stands in the doorway , surveying the room . The place is in a complete state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention . <p> HER POV : at the far end of the room , a FROSTED-GLASS PANELED DOOR leads to an adjacent room . <p> A HAND is visible on the other side , clawing at the glass . <p> Karen runs over and slides open the door , revealing  --  <p> 8a INT . TATAMI ROOM - DAY 8a <p> EMMA ( 60s , American ) . The older woman in the picture from Karen 's file . She 's lying on her stomach on a stained mattress , feebly looking up at Karen . <p> # KAREN # Oh my God ... are you alright ?  --  <p> Karen immediately kneels down next to the infirm woman , helping her sit up . Emma looks dazed and disoriented . <p> Karen 's eyes sweep the room . It reeks of neglect . <p> 9 EXT . THE HOUSE - PORCH - DAY 9 <p> Emma sits on the back porch , staring vacantly . But her expression is n't simply blank - there 's an odd sadness there . <p> Karen is washing the dirty sheets in a bucket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her charge . <p> # KAREN # Okay , Emma . Let 's try again : my name is Karen . Do you remember ? I 'm from the Health Center . I 'm substituting for Yoko , just for today . <p> Emma does n't respond  --  and there 's no indication that she remembers Karen introducing herself before . <p> Kneeling in front of Emma , Karen notices a BAND-AID around one of her fingers . Blood has soaked through it . <p> # KAREN # Looks like you need a new Band-Aid . How 'd this happen , Emma ? ( still no reaction ) Would you like a bath ? Maybe that will help you feel better . <p> Emma does n't even turn towards her . <p> 10 INT . THE HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY 10 <p> Karen turns on the water , puts the stopper over the drain . <p> 11 INT . THE HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY 11 <p> Karen supports Emma 's weight as she leads the old woman slowly down the hallway to the bathroom entrance  --  <p>  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TUB . <p> # KAREN # It 's okay , Emma . <p> She takes Emma 's hand and walks inside . But Emma does n't budge . Her free hand TIGHTLY CLUTCHES the door frame . <p> Her eyes are wide . Staring at the bathtub . <p> 12 EXT . THE HOUSE - PORCH - DAY 12 <p> Karen uses a sponge to bathe Emma , her robe rolled to her waist . Emma stares absently at the sky . <p> 13 INT . THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DUSK 13 <p> With Emma back in bed , Karen steps out of the back room and slides the door shut . Leans against it for a moment . A tough first day on the job . <p> 14 INT . THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DUSK 14 <p> Karen has straightened up the room , and is vacuuming the floor . Something under the couch catches in the vacuum intake , jamming it . <p> She turns off the vacuum and feels underneath , pulling out A CRUMPLED PHOTO  --  ripped into pieces , compressed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - DUSK 15 <p> Karen sits at the kitchen table , flattening and taping together the pieces of the photograph . She finishes . <p> ON THE PHOTO : a grinning JAPANESE BOY holds a cute BLACK CAT . His MOTHER and FATHER stand beside him . They 're all beaming at the camera  --  a perfect , happy family . <p> But there 's a piece missing . The MOTHER 'S FACE . <p> Karen walks back into the Living Room . She looks underneath the couch for the missing piece . Ca n't see anything . <p> She lays down and sticks her arm under the couch , feeling around . Nothing . <p> Karen sticks her arm in deeper , to the shoulder , straining ... <p> She suddenly jerks her arm back , wincing . She has a small cut on her finger . <p> Karen looks under the couch for what cut her  --  <p>  --  a small FURNITURE NAIL sticks out underneath . <p> # KAREN # Nice one , Karen . <p> She gets to her feet , folding up the incomplete picture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - DUSK 16 <p> Karen steps into the foyer with the vacuum cleaner . She looks up at A RAILING overhead . Some trash is visible sticking over the edge . Karen shakes her head : <p> # KAREN # How did you get up there ? <p> She gathers up the vacuum and heads up to the SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY . There 's a nearby door , closed ( the FRONT ROOM ) , and an open door at the end ( the REAR ROOM ) . <p> As she looks for an outlet , she hears a SCRATCHING SOUND . <p> Karen stands there for a moment , listening . Silence . <p> Then she walks towards the open door at the end of the hall . <p> 17 INT . THE HOUSE - REAR ROOM - DUSK 17 <p> Karen steps inside . MOVING BOXES are stacked against the wall , next to a desk . It 's an unfinished room . <p> She listens . No scratching . Nothing unusual here . Except  --  <p> Karen notices a lone object sitting on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Facing the wall . Strange . <p> And then Karen hears the SCRATCHING SOUND again . <p> 18 INT . THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - DUSK 18 <p> Karen steps into the hallway and listens . There it is again , and this time there 's no doubt  --  <p> The sounds are coming from the room by the stairs . <p> Karen walks to the door . She pauses , disturbed by the eerie sounds from inside . Then she reaches for the doorknob . <p> THUD . THUD . Karen hesitates . The strange rhythmic THUDDING continues , coming from beyond the door . <p> # KAREN # ( nervous : ) Hello ? <p> Karen takes a breath . And turns the doorknob . <p> 19 INT . THE HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - DUSK 19 <p> The sounds immediately stop as Karen enters the MASTER BEDROOM . It 's dark , thick blinds covering the windows . A frosted window , overlooking the foyer , is n't helping much . <p> She stands there for a moment , listening . Silence . <p> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns towards THE CLOSED CLOSET DOORS . That 's where the sound is coming from . <p> And then she notices something strange about the closet door : <p> It 's been sealed shut with duct tape . <p> The SCRATCHING quickens , as if sensing a presence nearby . <p> And then there 's a muffled MEOW . There 's a cat in there ? <p> Karen pulls off the duct tape . She reaches for the door handle , slowly sliding it open a crack and peering inside  --  <p> The closet seems empty , except for a large BOOK on a shelf . Karen reaches inside and picks it up . <p> Then she sees , in the darkened far corner of the closet , a SMALL BLACK CAT . It 's sitting on something , watching her . <p> Karen slides the door the rest of the way open  --  <p>  --  revealing A YOUNG JAPANESE BOY ( age 7 ) sitting in the corner , staring at Karen . The cat is curled up on his lap . <p> Startled , Karen drops the book and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KITCHEN - NIGHT 20 <p> Karen is on her cell phone : <p> KAREN ( INTO PHONE ) Yes , he was shut in a closet ! There was tape around the  --  No , they 're not home yet . I do n't know , Emma has n't said a word to me  --  He 's still upstairs  --  yes , I 'm sure he 's Japanese  --  But  --  Yes , alright , Alex . Just please get here as soon as you can . <p> Karen hangs up , putting the phone down on the kitchen table . She leans against the counter , exasperated . <p> Then her attention turns to THE BOOK she found in the closet . <p> Karen ca n't resist . She opens it . <p> THE BOOK is a large journal , filled with elegant Japanese writing . Karen flips through it , stopping on  --  <p> A PHOTOGRAPH . A handsome young man , smiling at the camera . <p> We recognize him . It 's PETER , from the opening scene . <p> 21 INT . THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reaching out to unlock it  --  <p>  --  but she pauses , realizing something . <p> She reaches into her pocket , pulling out THE PHOTO she found . It only takes a second to verify  --  <p>  --  THE BOY in the photo is the one she found in the closet . <p> Karen lowers the photo , bewildered . Then she looks up , startled by  --  <p> THE BOY . He 's kneeling on the second floor landing above , watching her through the bars of the metal railing . Creepy . <p> Karen takes a step forward , forcing a smile . <p> KAREN ( IN JAPANESE ) Hello there . <p> The boy just stares at her . Really creepy . <p> KAREN ( IN JAPANESE ) My name is Karen . What 's yours ? <p> # THE BOY # Toshio . <p> Before she can respond  --  <p> RING ! RING ! The phone in the next room startles her . <p> 22 INT . THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 22 <p> Karen enters the room as the ANSWERING MACHINE picks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GREETING ( in English ) : <p> MATTHEW &; JENNIFER ( ON MACHINE ) " Konnichiwa !

( MORE ) <p> SUSAN ( ON MACHINE ) ( cont 'd ) Okay , well , I 'm leaving work now so you can try my cell , or just call me at home later . " <p> The caller pauses . Karen steps closer to the phone base , curious , listening : <p> SUSAN ( ON MACHINE ) " I just wanted to make sure Mom is okay . Yesterday was ... a bit weird , and  --  I 'm just a little worried . " <p> Karen , reluctant but realizing she should pick up , reaches for the phone ... <p> ... but the PHONE BASE is empty . The cordless is missing . <p> As Karen tries to figure out how to answer with the base : <p> SUSAN ( ON MACHINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can , okay ? " <p> CLICK . Too late  --  the caller hangs up . <p> Silence returns to the room ... but not completely . Karen hears the soft sound of WHISPERING from nearby . <p> Beyond her , we see a PALE FACE ( KAYAKO ) pressed against the frosted window of the sliding door of the TATAMI ROOM . <p> The face pulls away from the glass just before Karen turns towards it . But the sound of WHISPERING continues . <p> As she slowly walks to the door , we can make out some words : <p> EMMA ( O.S. ) ... I 've told them over and over ... I 've told them over and over ... <p> Karen listens for a moment , then slides the door open . <p> 23 INT . THE HOUSE - TATAMI ROOM - NIGHT 23 <p> It 's very dark in the room  --  the lights have been turned off . Emma , sitting up in bed , turns towards Karen . <p> # KAREN # Emma , who were you talking to ? <p> That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from where Emma is sitting . Where someone else would be , if the old woman was having a conversation . <p> Emma looks up at Karen with pleading eyes . <p> # EMMA # I just want her to leave me alone . <p> Karen sits down next to her . <p> # KAREN # You should get some rest , Emma . <p> She helps Emma lie back  --  <p>  --  but as the old woman 's eyes move to the ceiling , they suddenly grow wide , her mouth opening in fear  --  <p>  --  Karen follows her gaze , looking up  --  <p>  --  and she SCREAMS , falling off the mattress , backing away  --  <p> A MURKY BLACKNESS is lowering from the ceiling . Formless at first , but flowing and shifting ... like a FIGURE draped with black silk . Drifting down until the shadowy " head " is only inches from Emma 's terrified face . <p> And then the " head " slowly turns , rotating towards Karen . <p> In the midst of the blackness are TWO DISEMBODIED EYES . Filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Off Karen 's NERVE-SHATTERING SCREAM , we ... <p> CUT TO BLACK . <p> 24 INT . THE HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT 24 <p> MATTHEW and his wife JENNIFER are in bed . He sleeps soundly , she does n't . She 's staring at the ceiling , listening to  --  <p>  --  SOUNDS coming in through the open bedroom door . Someone moving downstairs , fumbling around , bumping into things . <p> Jennifer , frustrated , lets out a sigh . <p> 25 INT . THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - MORNING 25 <p> Matthew comes downstairs , dressed in a business suit . He pauses to pick up some of the RUBBISH on the stairs . <p> 26 INT . THE HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING 26 <p> Jennifer watches the last drops of coffee fall into the pot . She pours herself a mug , takes a big sip . Looks exhausted . <p> Matthew enters , surprised to see her . <p> # MATTHEW # You 're up ? <p> # JENNIFER # Mmmmmm . <p> Matthew glances into the back room through another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not frosted like the living room . <p> HIS POV : Emma is asleep on her mattress . <p> # MATTHEW # I wonder if Mom 's okay .

It was probably just the move  --  I 'm sure she 'll get back on schedule . <p> Jennifer nods , not convinced . <p> # MATTHEW # You seen my travel mug ? <p> # JENNIFER # I did n't unpack it yet . <p> Matthew kneels down next to a pair of MOVING BOXES in the corner  --  KITCHEN ' written on the side . He explores it . <p> # MATTHEW # Maybe you should say something to the helper , what 's her name ? <p> # JENNIFER # Yoko . <p> # MATTHEW # Who knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # JENNIFER # Yeah . Maybe . <p> He finds his travel mug , wrapped in the sports section of an American newspaper . Matthew scans it as he fills his mug . <p> # MATTHEW # I miss seeing this every morning . <p> No response from his wife . He turns to see Jennifer looking down at Emma through the window . <p> Matthew walks over , puts an arm around her . <p> # MATTHEW # Hey , kiddo .

THE HOUSE - MORNING 27 <p> The door opens and Matthew walks outside , stopping to look at a familiar BICYCLE , leaning against the house near the door . <p> # MATTHEW # Is this Yoko 's bike ? <p> # JENNIFER # I think so . <p> # MATTHEW # It 's been here all night . <p> Matthew rolls the bike from the porch to the gate , leaning it against the wall ( where we saw it earlier ) . <p> He turns back to Jennifer , giving her a kiss . <p> # MATTHEW # I 'll probably be home late , maybe around nine or so . <p> Jennifer gives him a look . <p> # JENNIFER # I knew you 'd forget . <p> Matthew pauses , looks back blankly .

GROCERY STORE - DAY 28 <p> Jennifer stands by a cart , looking pale under the stark fluorescent lighting . She also looks shell-shocked . <p> HER POV : before her is a WALL OF JAPANESE PRODUCTS . Barely a lick of English on any of the brightly-colored packages . <p> Jennifer is , in a word , clueless . She looks around for assistance  --  but she 's lost in a whirl of Japanese faces . <p> She tentatively reaches towards a bowl-shaped package . Studies the Japanese writing . <p> Stealing a glance around her , she quietly tears open a corner of the bowl . Peeks inside . Sniffs it . She smiles . <p> 29 INT . THE HOUSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same package , a microwaveable soup bowl , now open with a spoon sticking out of it . Resting , with a glass of water , atop the kotatsu table . <p> PAN TO REVEAL a pair of feet on the lip of a MOVING BOX next to the table . It 's Jennifer , asleep on the couch . <p> A CLATTERING sound wakes her , followed by the sound of FOOTSTEPS running away . We PULL BACK as Jennifer sees her bowl , and the glass next to it , have been knocked over . <p> She sits up , looking into the TATAMI ROOM . Emma sits on the edge of her mattress , staring blankly at her . <p> Jennifer gets up , sternly walks over . <p> # JENNIFER # If you need something , all you have to do is say so  --  <p> She stops short as she sees ... <p> FOOTPRINTS .

THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - DAY 30 <p> Jennifer follows the DAMP FOOTPRINTS . They 're getting lighter , and cease altogether in the foyer . <p> She stands there for a moment , bewildered . Then she tenses , as if sensing she 's being watched . She slowly turns to see  --  <p>  --  A BLACK CAT . Sitting on the first landing of the stairs . Staring at her with bright yellow eyes . <p> As Jennifer takes a step towards it  --  <p> TWO CHILD 'S HANDS reach around the corner , and pick up the cat , pulling it out of view . <p> Jennifer freezes . <p> # JENNIFER # Who 's  --  who 's there ? <p> No response .

The same rhythmic thumping that Karen heard . <p> After a moment , Jennifer steps inside the room , disappearing from our sight . <p> We hear her suddenly draw a GASP . <p> A beat . As we DRIFT CLOSER to the doorway , we notice something strange : the room appears to be growing darker . <p> A SHARP BREATHING can be heard from inside ... quick , panicked gulps of air .

Switches on a small lamp  --  <p>  --  JENNIFER IS RIGHT NEXT TO HIM . Lying in bed , staring wide-eyed at the ceiling . Matthew , startled , falls backwards . <p> # MATTHEW # Jennifer ? What is it  --  <p> Matthew rushes to her , shaking her . She 's unresponsive . The only sign she 's alive is that HER FEARFUL EYES slowly fix on him . Her mouth opens , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # What 's wrong ? What happened ? ? ? <p> She tries harder to form words , but can only produce a CROAK . <p> # MATTHEW # I 'll ...

He peers inside . <p> HIS POV : A FIGURE covered head-to-toe in a white sheet lies on the mattress . Unmoving . <p> Alex tries the sliding door  --  it 's open . He steps inside . <p> # ALEX # Karen ? <p> Silence greets him . He stares down at the figure in the bed . <p> Alex licks his lips , nervous . Finally walks to the mattress , kneeling down next to it . <p> Raises a hand and grabs the sheet . Raises it over the head  --  <p>  --  it 's Emma . As we last saw her , eyes on the ceiling , mouth and eyes wide open in fear . <p> But now it 's clear , from the tache noire in the eyes , the blanched skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Alex falls back onto his butt , staring at Emma . He pulls himself away from the corpse  --  <p>  --  and freezes . There 's something right behind him . <p> He whirls around  --  <p>  --  it 's KAREN . In the corner , looking pale and dazed . <p> 68 EXT . THE HOUSE - NIGHT 68 <p> Two POLICE CARS and an AMBULANCE are parked out front . <p> An UNMARKED CAR pulls up , and DETECTIVE NAKAGAWA ( 40s ) exits the passenger side . He looks up at The House with dread . <p> The driver , DETECTIVE IGARASHI ( 30s ) , moves next to him . <p> IGARASHI ( IN JAPANESE ) I can handle this myself , you know . It 's just a routine call . I do n't know why you wanted to come . <p> He turns to Nakagawa , awaiting a response . He does n't get one . Nakagawa just stares up at The House . <p> 69 INT . THE HOUSE - LATER 69 <p> The house feels completely different : all the interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two EMTs wheel EMMA 'S BODY out the front door on a gurney . <p> Alex sits at the kitchen table , frazzled . He turns to  --  <p>  --  KAREN . She 's sitting in the living room , wrapped in a blanket , being attended to by a FEMALE NURSE and speaking with Nakagawa and Igarashi , who is taking notes on a pad . <p> Karen says something and the Detective looks over at Alex . Then he speaks to the Nurse , who helps Karen to her feet . <p> Nakagawa and Igarashi enter the kitchen . In perfect English : <p> # NAKAGAWA # I am Detective Nakagawa . This is Detective Igarashi , my assistant . <p> # ALEX # Is Karen okay ? <p> # NAKAGAWA # She is very shaken . We would like her to stay in the hospital tonight , under evaluation . <p> He hands Alex a wedding picture of MATTHEW AND JENNIFER . <p> # NAKAGAWA # Do you know these people ? <p> # ALEX # Matthew Williams , and his wife Jennifer . He 's Emma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> # NAKAGAWA # When was the last time you saw him ? <p> # ALEX # I met them when they came to register . It 's standard procedure , though the visits were arranged by his employer . He works at  --  <p> # NAKAGAWA # We 've spoken with his employer . He did not show up for work today . <p> Something about this gives Alex pause . Nakagawa speaks briefly to Igarashi in Japanese , then hands Alex a card . <p> # NAKAGAWA # If you could please come by tomorrow to make a statement , the address is there , at the bottom  --  <p> # ALEX # ( realizing ) Yoko . <p> # NAKAGAWA # I 'm sorry ? <p> # ALEX # Karen was a substitute  --  Yoko is the girl who is normally in charge of Emma .

THE HOUSE - NIGHT 70 <p> Nakagawa stands outside by the front gate , looking at  --  <p>  --  YOKO 'S BICYCLE . He looks down at it , frowning . <p> Then he suddenly cocks his head . As if sensing something . <p> He turns to look up at A WINDOW ON THE SECOND FLOOR . <p> It 's empty . <p> 71 INT . THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 71 <p> Igarashi stands by the ANSWERING MACHINE . The message counter reads 1 ' . He presses PLAY . <p> SUSAN 'S MESSAGE replays , and he listens carefully . As it ends , he turns to see NAKAGAWA standing in the doorway . <p> IGARASHI ( IN JAPANESE ) That 's Matthew 's sister . <p> He shows Nakagawa a PHOTO of Matthew and Susan , brother and sister , grinning at the camera . <p> IGARASHI ( IN JAPANESE ) This must be her . <p> The look on Nakagawa 's face is grave . <p> NAKAGAWA ( IN JAPANESE ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one answers , send someone to  --  <p> He trails off , looking down at  --  <p>  --  the PHONE BASE . The cordless phone is missing . <p> Nakagawa reaches down , pressing the LOCATE ' button . <p> A distant BEEPING SOUND can be heard . <p> Everyone in the room stops what they 're doing . They listen . <p> 72 INT . THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - NIGHT 72 <p> Nakagawa and Igarashi enter from the hallway , followed by their men . They look up to the second floor . <p> The BEEPING is definitely coming from upstairs . <p> 73 INT . THE HOUSE - REAR ROOM - NIGHT 73 <p> Nakagawa and Igarashi come upstairs , their men following close behind . <p> They pause in the hallway for a moment . Then Nakagawa walks into the rear room ( Matthew 's office ) . The BEEPING is close . <p> He stands there , in the center of the room , listening . <p> Then he looks up , at the ceiling . Everyone follows suit . <p> Nakagawa turns to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NIGHT 74 <p> He quickly pulls open the door . The closet is empty . <p> Nakagawa looks up , peering into the darkness . <p> HIS POV : the ATTIC PANEL yawns wide open . <p> And right next to it are FOUR LONG GROOVES in the ceiling . As if something was dragged across it , right to the edge . <p> Something like fingernails . <p> Nakagawa leans out , looking at Igarashi . <p> NAKAGAWA ( IN JAPANESE ) I need your flashlight . <p> 75 INT . ATTIC - NIGHT 75 <p> A shaft of light from the flashlight through the open attic access cuts through the thick darkness . <p> Nakagawa appears , pulling himself up into the attic . He swings his flashlight slowly around the room . <p> Igarashi comes up next to Nakagawa just as the Detective 's flashlight stops on something . <p> A beat as they exchange an uneasy look . <p> Then Nakagawa and Igarashi crawl through the darkness towards the far corner of the space . <p> Two bodies are tucked into the corner . MATTHEW AND JENNIFER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nakagawa sits in front of the bodies , examining them . <p> IGARASHI ( IN JAPANESE ) What the hell ... what is going on ? <p> Nakagawa sees the beeping CORDLESS PHONE a few feet away . <p> SOMETHING next to it attracts Nakagawa 's interest . We ca n't see what it is , but there 's some DEEP RED in it , and something very WHITE  --  <p> IGARASHI ( IN JAPANESE ) What is that ? <p>  --  Nakagawa 's eyes widen as he realizes what he 's looking at . <p> 76 EXT . THE HOUSE - NIGHT 76 <p> The POLICE CARS outside have attracted a small crowd . The TWO BODIES are being loaded into a POLICE VAN . <p> Nakagawa stands with THE CORONER . The CORONER 'S ASSISTANT , wearing a face mask and rubber gloves , approaches . He holds something small , wrapped in a bloody white sheet . <p> The Coroner slowly unfolds the sheet . We ca n't see what he 's looking at  --  but it elicits quite a reaction . <p> CORONER ( IN JAPANESE ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JAPANESE ) We do n't know . <p> The Coroner quickly re-covers the object . <p> CORONER ( IN JAPANESE ) I can use the blood to help identify the person . <p> As the Coroner and his assistant walk away : <p> NAKAGAWA ( IN JAPANESE ) Is it possible that someone could live without ... that ? <p> The Coroner turns back , his face pale . <p> CORONER ( IN JAPANESE ) I certainly hope not . <p> Nakagawa turns away to see Igarashi approaching , talking into a cell phone . He looks disturbed . As he hangs up : <p> IGARASHI ( IN JAPANESE ) Someone just reported another death . It 's not in our district ... but I think we should check it out . <p> Nakagawa realizes something 's troubling his partner . <p> NAKAGAWA ( IN JAPANESE ) Why ? <p> IGARASHI ( IN JAPANESE ) The cause of death is not clear ... but it is the man who sold them this house . <p> 77 EXT . TOKYO STREET - DAY 77 <p> CLOSE ON the spinning wheels of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being pumped by a beautiful young Japanese woman  --  this is YOKO ( early 20s ) . <p> Yoko turns , riding down a small side street . It ends , and she rounds a corner stopping in front of  --  <p> 77a EXT . THE HOUSE - DAY 77a <p> Yoko opens the gate and walks her bike to the front door , leaning it against the wall nearby ( exactly where we saw Matthew bump into it earlier ) . <p> She rings the door buzzer . Waits . She seems to have expected this : she pulls a KEY from her pocket , with a plastic LABEL on it . <p> 78 INT . THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - DAY 78 <p> Yoko steps inside . She instinctively slips off her shoes . She calls out , in decent English : <p> # YOKO # Hi , excuse me ? <p> There 's a small ENVELOPE with YOKO 'S NAME resting on a small table by the door . She takes it , opens it . <p> THE LETTER says , simply : " Out for a walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It 's Yoko . I 'm coming in . <p> 79 INT . THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 79 <p> The house is the least " moved-into " that we 've seen so far : although the main furniture is in place , MOVING BOXES are stacked in every room , in various stages of unpacking . <p> But there 's also an unusual amount of mess in the house  --  a disarray , much like the opening sequence , that is n't exactly related to moving in . <p> Yoko surveys the room , dismayed by the mess . <p> Then she sees EMMA at the far end of the living room , her back to Yoko . She 's looking down at something in her hands . <p> # YOKO # Hi , Emma . It 's good to see you again . <p> Emma turns . Looks blankly at Yoko , who approaches . Realizing the woman does n't remember her : <p> # YOKO # My name is Yoko . <p> The old woman still gives no sign of recognition . Yoko gently takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed  --  <p> Then she sees what Emma was looking at : the roll of DUCT TAPE . She 's cut her finger on the serrated cutting blade . <p> YOKO ( IN JAPANESE ) You should n't be playing with this ! <p> Shaking her head , Yoko takes the duct tape and looks around for a place where Emma ca n't get at it  --  <p>  --  she puts the tape ON THE STACK OF BOOKS at the top of the bookshelf , next to the scissors ( where Matthew found them ) . <p> 80 OMITTED 80 <p> 81 OMITTED 81 <p> 81a INT . THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - DAY 81a <p> From the entrance , we see Yoko come out of the kitchen holding a tray with a teapot and cup . <p> She walks into the BACK ROOM , looking down at Emma 's bed . The old woman must be asleep : Yoko gently lays down the tray , quietly steps out of the room and slides the door shut . <p> Then Yoko moves through the LIVING ROOM to the PHONE BASE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it belongs . <p> Yoko dials a number as she walks into THE ENTRANCE HALL . She begins a conversation ( in Japanese ) as she looks at the scattered rubbish on the ground , shaking her head . <p> She climbs up to the SECOND FLOOR , pausing to kneel and pick up some pieces of crumpled paper , chatting all the while . <p> THUD . THUD . Yoko pauses , turning towards the open door to the front room . The rhythmic THUMPING continues . <p> 82 OMITTED 82 <p> 83 OMITTED 83 <p> 84 INT . THE HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - DAY 84 <p> The room is a mess . The bed is unmade , clothes are strewn on the floor . Looks like a storm swept through it . <p> Yoko stands in the doorway , listening for the THUMPING sounds . But they 've stopped . <p> She finishes her call and hangs up . Sighs . She sticks the cordless phone into her pocket and starts to clean the room . <p> As Yoko straightens the bedspread , she hears something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a familiar THROATY CROAKING SOUND . Quiet and muffled . <p> Yoko , a bit unnerved by the strange sound , pulls a small M player and headphones from her pocket . She puts them on , and goes back to work . <p> 84aa INT . THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY 84aa <p> Yoko backs into the hallway , humming along to the music . Preoccupied , she does n't notice as  --  <p> The DOOR TO THE REAR ROOM , at the end of the dark hall behind her , SLOWLY SWINGS OPEN . <p> Yoko turns and walks down the hall towards it . <p> 84a INT . THE HOUSE - REAR ROOM - DAY 84a <p> Yoko enters the room , which is also a mess . The MOVING BOXES are tumbled about the small room . She sighs . <p> Then she notices the CERAMIC CAT on the shelf , FACING HER ( where Susan left it ) . Apparently she 's not a big fan of felines : she uneasily turns it to FACE THE WALL instead . <p> Yoko turns back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the way we saw them before ) . As she does  --  <p>  --  she pauses again . The music in her headphones starts PHASING , digital noise creeping in ... <p> Yoko takes off the headphones . Stares at them . <p> And then there 's another CROAKING SOUND . From close by . <p> Yoko draws a breath , quickly looking up  --  <p>  --  AT THE CEILING , directly above her . That 's where the horrible sound is coming from . <p> Freaked out , Yoko backs away , and opens the bedroom door  --  <p> 85 INT . THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY 85 <p>  --  the hallway is COMPLETELY DARK . An unnatural blackness . The skylights above , which were previously filled with sunlight , are now completely opaque . <p> Yoko stands in the doorway , scared , afraid to step into the darkness . Then she looks down  --  <p> HER POV : the murky blackness of the hall seems to be slowly CREEPING IN , phantomlike , around the edges of the door . <p> 86 INT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yoko stumbles back into the room . Her eyes fixed on  --  <p>  --  THE DOORWAY : the creeping darkness is now coming in around all sides , not just the bottom . <p> Yoko backs up to the bed , still clutching the CORDLESS PHONE . <p> She looks back at the door , suddenly CRYING OUT  --  <p>  --  A BLACK CAT sits in the doorway . Tail wrapped around itself , sitting perfectly still , like a statue . Staring at Yoko with its yellow eyes . Something unnatural about it . <p> Yoko backs away towards the closet . Nowhere to go . <p> The cat suddenly HISSES AT HER  --  <p>  --  and that 's all Yoko can take . In a panic , she opens the closet door , ducks inside . <p> 87 INT . CLOSET - DAY 87 <p> Yoko slams the door shut , pulling herself up onto a raised shelf . Breathing hard , looking down at  --  <p>  --  the crack under the door . The light is beginning to dim . <p> Yoko presses back into the closet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quickly . <p> Yoko looks around desperately . Looking up , she sees  --  <p>  --  THE ATTIC PANEL above her is wide open . <p> Caught between a rock and a hard place . Yoko decides : <p> She shakily stands on the shelf and reaches up to pull herself into the attic . <p> 88 INT . ATTIC - DAY 88 <p> Yoko 's head appears . Then her shoulders . She looks around , but ca n't see a thing in the darkness . <p> She 's about to pull herself all the way up  --  <p>  --  when she hears the THROATY CROAKING SOUND . <p> Coming from the darkness . <p> Yoko stiffens , her breath catching in her throat . <p> ANOTHER POV : we 're at the far end of the attic , suddenly and rapidly RACING FORWARD TOWARDS YOKO ... <p> ON YOKO : something brushes her face . Long , black hair . <p> There 's a head , just inches from hers . Almost nose-to-nose . <p> Yoko is paralyzed with fear , eyes wide . A long beat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a LIGHTER . <p> Yoko raises it and flicks the wheel  --  <p>  --  we get a glimpse of a PALE FACE , surrounded by long black hair , eyes wide and mouth open , the THROATY SOUND suddenly increasing in pitch and volume  --  <p>  --  as the face moves forward  --  <p> CUT TO BLACK . <p> 89 INT . HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 89 <p> Karen slowly wakes up in bed . As her eyes clear , she sees  --  <p> DOUG . He sits on the edge of the bed , slightly slumped , his back to her . <p> He slowly turns  --  and a relieved smile crosses his face . He moves closer , and reaches out a hand . <p> # DOUG # It 's okay . I 've got you . <p> Karen nods , lacing her fingers in his . But her eyes are glazed and unfocused  --  she 's exhausted . <p> # DOUG # Your boss told me what happened . I 'm sorry . <p> She turns away , the memory bothering her . Doug takes her hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I talked to your teachers . They said you can take as much time as you need . We could go to Kyoto for a weekend , see those temples you 're always talking about . <p> Karen tries to smile back , but her heart 's not in it . <p> # KAREN # Running away wo n't help . <p> # DOUG # There 's nothing to run away from , Kat . No one blames you for what happened . <p> # KAREN # I 'm not even sure what did happen . <p> # DOUG # You went to help someone who was , quite simply , beyond help . <p> # KAREN # No , that 's not what I mean ... <p> She trails off , trying to remember . Doug waits . <p> # KAREN # That house . There was something ... <p> Doug sees her frustration , and tenderly brushes a hair from her face . <p> # DOUG # Do n't beat yourself up searching for a greater truth , Kat . An old woman passed away in her sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  <p> # KAREN # Is that how they said she died ? <p> # DOUG # I 'm sorry this happened to you . But maybe , in a way , it will help you later . Death is an unfortunate but integral part of your future career . There 's no avoiding it . Maybe now you 'll be more ... ready for it . <p> # KAREN # I do n't think I 'll ever be ready for something like that . <p> She turns away . Doug wraps an arm around her . Karen leans into him , and he strokes her hair . <p> The moment is broken by a soft KNOCK . Detective Nakagawa stands in the doorway , holding a thick FILE . <p> # NAKAGAWA # I 'm sorry to disturb you , Miss Davies . I was wondering if you could answer some additional questions ? <p> Doug stands , intercepting Nakagawa . He sticks out a hand . <p> # DOUG # I 'm Doug . Karen 's boyfriend . <p> Nakagawa nods . Fixes Doug with a blank stare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # DOUG # You up for this ? <p> # KAREN # ( nodding : ) Why do n't you find out when I can check out of here . <p> Reluctantly , Doug kisses her brow , then exits . Nakagawa pulls a chair up to the bed and sits , putting the file on a small table . <p> # NAKAGAWA # How are you feeling ? <p> # KAREN # Okay . Tired . <p> # NAKAGAWA # You are an exchange student ? ( Karen nods : ) And you have been volunteering at the Health Center for ... ? <p> # KAREN # Three months . I needed a social welfare credit . <p> # NAKAGAWA # You said this was the first time you 'd been in that house ? <p> # KAREN # Yes . <p> She notices Nakagawa is n't taking notes . He seems somewhat uncomfortable , as if he 's building to something : <p> # NAKAGAWA # About the Japanese boy you said you saw there  --  <p> # KAREN # Did you find him ? <p> # NAKAGAWA # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taped into the closet ? <p> # KAREN # Yes , that 's right . He was ... holding a cat . A black cat . ( remembering : ) There was a book in the closet , too . I think it was a journal . <p> # NAKAGAWA # Did it belong to the boy ? <p> # KAREN # I do n't think so . I think it belonged to a woman . <p> Nakagawa looks up . Karen tries to explain : <p> # KAREN # The writing . It looked feminine . <p> # KAREN # I left it on the kitchen table . <p> Nakagawa frowns , scribbles a note . <p> # NAKAGAWA # I did n't see any book on the table . Perhaps someone moved it . Did you speak with the boy after you opened the closet ? <p> She thinks , recalling : <p> # KAREN # I asked him his name . He said Toshio ' . <p> Nakagawa immediately tenses . A long beat . He can see how exhausted Karen is . But something 's troubling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please . <p> He slowly reaches into his pocket and pulls out THE PHOTO Karen found , and taped together . He shows it to her . <p> # NAKAGAWA # We found this in the room where ... <p> Karen looks at the picture . <p> # KAREN # This is him . This is the boy . <p> # NAKAGAWA # Are you certain ? <p> # KAREN # Yes . Positive . <p> Nakagawa stares down at the picture in his hands . <p> And Karen notices  --  Nakagawa 's hands are shaking . <p> # KAREN # Detective Nakagawa ? <p> He looks up at her , a faraway look in his eyes . <p> # KAREN # The whole time I was in that house , I felt something was ... wrong . <p> From the expression on Nakagawa 's face , she 's onto something . <p> # KAREN # What happened there ? <p> Nakagawa holds Karen 's gaze for a moment . Even in her exhausted state , it 's clear  --  she 's as frightened as he is . <p> # NAKAGAWA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman you were caring for were found in the attic . <p> Karen just stares at him , stunned . <p> # NAKAGAWA # It seems that the son killed his wife , and then himself  --  <p> There 's a KNOCK on the door . Igarashi stands in the doorway . He speaks to Nakagawa in Japanese . <p> # NAKAGAWA # ( to Karen ) Please excuse me for a moment . <p> Nakagawa puts the photo down and steps into the hallway and closes the door , but not all the way . Karen watches and listens through the crack : <p> 90 INT . HOSPIAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT 90 <p> IN THE HALLWAY : the men speak with hushed voices . <p> IGARASHI ( IN JAPANESE ) We checked the apartment of Susan , the sister . She was n't there ... <p> He trails off , hesitating . <p> NAKAGAWA ( IN JAPANESE ) Yes ? <p> IGARASHI ( IN JAPANESE ) The chain lock had been drawn from the inside . And the deadbolt . But we found no one in the apartment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JAPANESE ) Get the surveillance tapes from the office building . <p> Igarashi nods . But does n't move . After a moment , quietly : <p> IGARASHI ( IN JAPANESE ) They were the first family to live in that house since the incident three years ago  --  <p> Nakagawa 's harsh look silences him . Then the Detective turns , noticing KAREN watching them . He pulls the door shut . <p> 91 INT . HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 91 <p> Nakagawa 's stern voice is muffled by the closed door . Karen sits back in bed , disturbed . <p> Then her attention turns to THE FILE on the table . <p> She considers . Then reaches for it . Opens it . <p> It 's a POLICE REPORT , in Japanese . <p> Karen scans it , and turns the page . She draws a breath  --  <p>  --  it 's a photo of THE HOUSE . Cordoned off with police tape . An ambulance out front . Like the scene she just left ... <p> ... only the picture is dated three years ago . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferring in the entryway . <p> The photo of the house is attached to a POLICE REPORT , with THREE PICTURES . A stern-looking Japanese man ( TAKEO ) , a somber woman ( KAYAKO ) , and a YOUNG BOY we know very well  --  <p> Karen makes the connection . She picks up the taped-up photo and compares it to the file ... the boy and his father are the same as in the newspaper . <p> Karen gently touches the " missing " face of KAYAKO  --  then her eyes move to the picture of THE BOY . <p> Her eyes widen as she reads THE JAPANESE TEXT under his face : <p> # KAREN # Toshio ... <p> 92 INT . NURSING CARE CENTER - NIGHT 92 <p> The place is quiet , completely deserted . Except for  --  <p>  --  Alex . He 's behind his desk in the reception area , staring off into space . Alex finally glances up at a clock  --  it 's almost ten o'clock . <p> He gets up , turns off his computer , switches off the lights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FRONT DOORS . He hits a final light switch and is almost to the exit , when  --  <p>  --  he suddenly SLIPS . Almost falls . Saves himself by throwing a hand up against the wall . <p> He looks down . What the hell did he slip on ? <p> A pool of liquid . Right by the front doors , where the ladder stood earlier . It 's too dark to make out what the fluid is . <p> Alex looks down at HIS HAND  --  it 's covered in the liquid . And there 's a dark HANDPRINT where he grabbed the wall . <p> HIS POV : a trail of FOOTPRINTS lead from the pool of liquid , around the base of the stairs . <p> His eyes on his dirtied hand , Alex slowly reaches for the nearby light switch . The overheads come on  --  <p>  --  the liquid is deep red . Blood . <p> Alex looks across the room . Shaking , he starts to walk forward , following the footsteps . <p> He pauses at the bottom of the stairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right by the bottom step . <p> Alex looks up the staircase . No blood . <p> After a moment , Alex starts to walk up . As he reaches the first landing  --  <p> He freezes . Sensing something behind him . He turns to see  --  <p> YOKO . Head lowered , clothing is torn and bloody . She 's slowly climbing up the steps , but she 's MOVING JERKILY , like a marionette , her limbs making a strange CREAKING as if tendons and muscles are being pushed to their limits . <p> And there 's BLOOD DRIPPING DOWN , splattering on her shoes . <p> # ALEX # Yoko ? <p> She keeps moving , straining , climbing ... towards him . <p> # ALEX # What ... What happened , Yoko ? <p> Now she finally stops , two steps away . A long beat . <p> # ALEX # Say something , please ... <p> Yoko slowly raises her head towards him  --  <p>  --  the lower half of her face is missing . Her jawbone has been ripped out , her tongue hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his foot lands right in a puddle of blood . His legs fly out from under him and he CRACKS HIS HEAD AGAINST THE GROUND . <p> HIS POV : everything goes blurry , and canted 90 degrees . But it looks like there 's A FIGURE standing in the hallway , watching the scene ... <p> ... a small boy holding a black cat ... <p> Dazed , Alex plants a hand on the ground and pulls himself into a seating position  --  <p>  --  and coming face-to-face with YOKO , kneeling down directly in front of him . Her bloody tongue dripping , lolling ... <p> ON ALEX : eyes wide , he opens his mouth to scream  --  <p> HARD CUT TO : <p> 93 INT . POLICE STATION - NAKAGAWA 'S OFFICE - DAWN 93 <p> Nakagawa sits at the desk . Exhausted , dark circles under his eyes , he 's staring down at  --  <p> THE FILE on his desk . As if he 's afraid to even open it . <p> But he does . He flips through the photos , pausing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND WHITE PHOTO of The House from three years ago ( the one Karen saw ) , with the THREE DETECTIVES . <p> Nakagawa turns to a FRAMED PICTURE on his desk  --  it 's YOUNGER NAKAGAWA at a bar with THREE FAMILIAR DETECTIVES . They 're off-duty , grinning at the camera . Buddies . <p> The two photographs share THE SAME THREE DETECTIVES . <p> As Nakagawa looks at the crime scene photo , he realizes something . He slowly stands , in shock , trembling . <p> The phone RINGS , startling him . <p> Nakagawa walks over , picks up the phone . <p> NAKAGAWA ( IN JAPANESE ) Hello ? <p> He listens . <p> His face goes blank . He slowly lowers the phone . <p> 94 OMITTED 94 <p> 95 OMITTED 95 <p> 96 OMITTED 96 <p> 97 OMITTED 97 <p> 98 OMITTED 98 <p> 99 INT . MORGUE - DAY 99 <p> The CORONER sits on a stool , staring at the floor . TWO BODIES lie under bloody white sheets on two STEEL TABLES . Between them is a small cart  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter . The Coroner stands , nervous . He walks to one of the tables and pulls back the sheet . <p> NAKAGAWA ( IN JAPANESE ) Have you determined a cause of death ? <p> CORONER ( IN JAPANESE ) Not yet . The blood on his body  - -  is n't his . It belongs to her . <p> He points to the other table . But does n't look at it . <p> NAKAGAWA ( IN JAPANESE ) I do n't understand .

Still missing her jawbone . <p> Nakagawa and Igarashi stare down at her in disbelief . <p> The Coroner walks to the small table , removing the cloth .

Carefully . <p> # DOUG # Okay . How about this : the American family knew about what had happened there before , and this knowledge subconsciously caused them to repeat the same events . <p> Karen gives Doug a skeptical look . <p> # DOUG # It 's exactly how superstitions survive : if you walk under a ladder and think uh-oh , you 're in for some bad luck , sure enough , what do you know ?

Softly , but firmly : <p> # KAREN # You might be right , Doug . But I know what I saw .

This seems to worsen Karen 's mood . <p> Karen looks down at a NOTEPAD . She 's written THREE JAPANESE NAMES . The detectives in charge of the case three years ago . <p> They all have red lines drawn through them . <p> Then we PAN UP to see that these are the last names on a longer list . We recognize the other names : MATTHEW , JENNIFER , and EMMA WILLIAMS ; YOKO and ALEX ; NAKAGAWA and IGARASHI . Everyone who 's been in The House . <p> Everyone who died . All the names have been CROSSED OUT  --  <p>  --  except Nakagawa ' and Igarashi ' . Karen picks up a red pen and draws a line through them . <p> Then we see one final name at the bottom : <p> Me . ' Now the only one not crossed out . The only one left . <p> Karen puts down her pen . Then she looks up at  --  <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pictures and articles in a circle . <p> Karen realizes something . She reaches for the lamp , and turns it closer  --  <p>  --  the picture in the middle of the " spider 's web " is gone . <p> The photo of The House . <p> Karen draws a breath . Then , out of the corner of her eye , she sees something she had n't noticed before  --  <p>  --  a faint red FLASHING from a small table by the kitchen . <p> She slowly stands . Walks over to it . The flashing red light is barely visible on her face , as she looks down at  --  <p>  --  HER ANSWERING MACHINE . The message light is blinking . <p> 1 MESSAGE ' . <p> She reaches out a shaky finger and presses PLAY ' . <p> DOUG ( ON MACHINE ) " Hey , Karen . It 's me . I just wanted to say  --  I 'm sorry . I know I was n't hearing you . ( MORE ) <p> DOUG ( ON MACHINE ) ( cont 'd ) If all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , and I 'm gon na check that house out . So just sit tight , I wo n't be long . I love you . " <p> Karen presses the STOP button . <p> She stands there for a moment , in the near-darkness . <p> Then , softly : <p> # KAREN # No . <p> 126a EXT . KAREN 'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 126a <p> Karen runs outside , struggling to pull on her coat . She races down the sidewalk at top speed . <p> 126b EXT . THE HOUSE - NIGHT 126b <p> Doug stands at the gate , lighting a cigarette , looking down at the POLICE TAPE sealing the entrance . He pockets his Zippo and ducks under the tape , walking up to  --  <p> THE FRONT DOOR . Doug tries the handle , and the door swings open . He stands on the porch , looking into the dark place . <p> 126bb EXT . STREET - NIGHT 126bb <p> Karen runs down the steps from the train , racing into the SHOPPING DISTRICT . <p> 126c INT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside , trying the light switch . Nothing happens . But he smiles , shaking his head , completely unafraid . <p> # DOUG # Hello ? <p> As he takes a step forward his foot bumps THE GAS CANS , still sitting by the front door . <p> He 's confused  --  and then he gets a good idea . He tosses his cigarette outside and closes the front door . <p> 126d INT . THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 126d <p> Doug walks through the living room , glancing inside the small KITCHEN , then he slides open the door to the TATAMI ROOM . <p> He winces as his eyes meet the STAINED MATTRESS . <p> 126e INT . THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - NIGHT 126e <p> Doug re-enters the entryway , looking back up to the second floor . He starts up . <p> 126f INT . THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT 126f <p> Doug walks to the FRONT ROOM door and opens it . He leans inside , trying to let his eyes adjust to the dark . <p> Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . Nothing but darkness beyond . <p> Doug closes the door and turns away from it , wondering why he 's here , what he 's looking for . <p> He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his cell phone . Speed-dials Karen 's number . As he raises it to his ear  --  <p>  --  he does n't notice the door to the rear room SLOWLY SWINGING OPEN BEHIND HIM  --  <p> 127 EXT . THE HOUSE - NIGHT 127 <p> Karen runs towards us , breathless , stopping as she reaches  --  <p>  --  THE HOUSE . Looming over her . Waiting . <p> She only hesitates a moment before running inside . <p> 128 INT . THE HOUSE - NIGHT 128 <p> Karen enters , calling out : <p> # KAREN # Doug ! Where are you ? ? ? <p> A MUFFLED SOUND from upstairs . A voice . <p> # KAREN # Doug ? ? ? <p> Karen immediately runs up the stairs to  --  <p> THE SECOND FLOOR . Before she reaches the top of the stairs , Karen suddenly realizes : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> VOICE ( O.S. ) Hey , Maria , it 's me . Yeah , I 'm still at school ... <p> Karen slowly looks up to see  --  <p>  --  PETER . She recognizes him immediately . He 's standing in the hallway , talking on his cell phone . <p> PETER ( INTO PHONE ) ... I know , I 'm sorry  --  these staff meetings always run over  --  maybe another ten minutes or so  --  okay , I 'll be home soon  --  I love you too . <p> He hangs up . Leans against the wall . Looking into  --  <p> THE FRONT BEDROOM . Karen gasps as she sees TOSHIO through the open door . He 's sitting on the ground , making drawings of BLACK CATS . This is his bedroom . <p> # PETER # ( under his breath ) Guess your mom 's late , huh ? <p> Then Toshio suddenly looks up . Right at Karen . <p> Following Toshio 's gaze , Peter quickly turns to face Karen . But even though she 's right there , he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened three years ago . <p> As if sensing her presence , Peter walks right to the edge of the stairs , looking down . Then : <p> A RUSTLING SOUND comes from the dark hallway . Peter turns towards the REAR BEDROOM at the end of the hall . <p> 129 INT . THE HOUSE - REAR BEDROOM - NIGHT 129 <p> Peter stands in the doorway , looking into the MASTER BEDROOM of Toshio 's parents . His attention is drawn to something near the door  --  <p>  --  a DESK . It 's got a computer , some files . Someone 's personal work space . <p> Peter steps to the desk . He picks up A STACK OF PHOTOGRAPHS . Family pictures : with father ( TAKEO ) , mother ( KAYAKO ) , and son ( TOSHIO ) , holding his black CAT . <p> KAYAKO 'S FACE has been torn out of every one . <p> Peter notices something underneath the pile of photos  --  a familiar JOURNAL . The same one Karen found in the closet . He opens it . <p> HIS POV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flips through it , KAYAKO 'S VOICE speaks the words ... <p> ... and even though it 's mostly Japanese , there 's one word we recognize , that she 's written repeatedly  --  <p>  --  " Peter " . It 's been written over and over , in both English and Japanese , as if she could n't get enough of seeing it . <p> Past the early pages Karen saw , THE WRITING becomes more manic , the delicate script becoming a frantic scrawl , KAYAKO 'S VOICE becomes more desperate and pleading . <p> Taped on the final page is A PHOTO : PETER with a group of his University friends , at a party . Kayako has scribbled hearts around his head , and SCRATCHED OUT the other faces . <p> A bloody THUMBPRINT distorts Peter 's face . It 's still wet . <p> Peter slams the book shut and drops it . As he does , a PHOTOGRAPH falls out from inside , landing right-side up . <p> THE PHOTO is of PETER at a college party , talking with MARIA . It 's clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ... but the photo is TORN IN HALF , splitting Maria 's face . And KAYAKO is visible between them , sadly and stoically watching Peter , strands of hair falling down her face . <p> Peter and Karen both reach to pick up the photo at the same time  --  and they BUMP SHOULDERS . Karen falls backwards , against the wall . <p> In disbelief , Peter looks around wildly . He reaches out a tentative hand , feeling around ... Karen moves out of the way . She ca n't understand how this could be happening . <p> As Peter is about to stand back up , SOMETHING small flutters down from above , landing on the floor in front of him . <p> It 's KAYAKO 'S FACE . One of the missing pieces from the torn-out photographs . <p> Peter slowly looks up to see  --  <p>  --  ALL THE MISSING KAYAKO FACES have been pinned to the closet door . Many of the pins go through HER EYES . <p> And that 's when Peter and Karen hear THE FLIES . Buzzing anxiously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's coming from THE CLOSET . Just behind the torn-out faces . <p> Karen watches , terrified , as Peter reaches out a hand  --  <p>  --  and slides the door open . <p> He immediately recoils . A terrible stench inside . <p> The BUZZING of the flies is louder . Coming from above . <p> Peter pulls a book of matches from his pocket . Lights one . <p> And looks up . <p> HIS POV : the attic panel is slightly open . <p> Peter reaches up to open it fully  --  <p>  --  AND THE UPPER HALF OF KAYAKO swings down . <p> She 's been wrapped in plastic sheeting , mottled splotches of blood on the inside . Her neck hangs at an odd angle . <p> Peter backs away in horror  --  <p> 130 INT . THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT 130 <p> Peter backs into the hallway , breathing hard . <p> Then a familiar sound reaches our ears : THUD . THUD . THUD . <p> It 's coming from Toshio 's room . And it 's the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Peter wrenches his gaze from the horrific sight and heads quickly down the hall ( with Karen following him ) : <p> # PETER # Toshio ! We have to  --  <p> He stops short at the door , as he sees  --  <p>  --  TAKEO , Toshio 's father . Eyes rolled back in his head , tongue swollen and lolling from his blue lips . <p> He 's dead  --  he 's hanging from the ceiling by BLACK HAIR that seems to cover its entire surface . Kayako 's hair . <p> TOSHIO , now back to his " dead " appearance , playfully swings the body . Takeo 's feet THUD rhythmically against the wall . <p> # KAREN # Oh my God ... <p> Peter does n't stay to see any more . He runs . <p> 131 INT . THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - NIGHT 131 <p> Peter tears down the stairs and runs for the front door , passing a mirror  --  <p>  --  he freezes . He saw SOMETHING in the reflection as he passed . Something wrong . <p> He takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not his reflection in the mirror . It 's KAYAKO . <p> Peter stares at the image in disbelief . Then he notices TOSHIO standing next to Kayako , looking up at her . <p> As Peter slowly turns to look down , a small PALE HAND slips into his own . Peter jerks backward in shock as  --  <p> A SERIES OF IMAGES , THE ORIGIN OF " THE GRUDGE " , FLASH BY : <p>  --  TAKEO , looking down at THE JOURNAL , reading his wife 's words , his face contorted with rage ... he turns to see KAYAKO , home from work , standing in the doorway ... <p>  --  KAYAKO running down the steps , TAKEO chasing her , tackling her before she can reach the door ... sitting on top of her , he wraps his hands around her neck ... <p>  --  KAYAKO seeing TOSHIO , her son , watching through the bars of the second floor railing as ... <p>  --  TAKEO snaps Kayako 's neck with an audible CRACK ... <p>  --  KAYAKO , not dead , but paralyzed , watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathroom tub ... <p>  --  TAKEO tears apart TOSHIO 'S CAT , still alive , in the bathroom sink ... <p>  --  KAYAKO letting out a HORRIBLE CROAKING , the only sound her broken neck can emit , as TAKEO advances on her with a knife , his eyes filled with a manic madness ... <p>  --  TAKEO in THE ATTIC , stuffing KAYAKO and TOSHIO , both very dead , wrapped in plastic sheeting , into a corner ... <p>  --  KAYAKO suddenly TURNING HER HEAD and GRABBING TAKEO 'S ARM ... her lifeless eyes focusing on Takeo 's as she CROAKS ... Takeo 's eyes go wide with fear ... and TOSHIO suddenly reaches from his plastic grave , grabbing Takeo 's other arm ... <p> BACK TO THE PRESENT : <p> We PAN FROM Peter to THE REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR  --  <p> It 's not the pale , frightening Kayako anymore . Rather : a beautiful , young Kayako with eyes filled with sorrow . <p> We PAN BACK to see KAREN standing there , instead of Peter . <p> Karen slumps to the ground in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her . <p> A beat . Then : <p> THUMP . That came from upstairs . <p> Karen looks up as the sound continues . We PAN OVER towards the stairs as A DRAGGING sound moves across the ceiling . Accompanied by a strange SCRAPING , like plastic . <p> # KAREN # No more ... please , no more ... <p> She suddenly freezes , sensing something next to her . We see it now , as she turns her head , almost hidden in the darkness  --  <p>  --  a PALE FACE in the darkened hallway , staring up at the ceiling . Eyes wide and rolled back , mouth yawning open in abject terror  --  <p>  --  it 's DOUG 'S BODY . He lies on his back , his top half sticking out from a niche by the stairwell . It 's been right next to her all along . <p> # KAREN # DOUG ! NO ! ! ! <p> Karen takes Doug into her arms as the SOUNDS continue above , growing closer . But it 's no use  --  he 's dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the stairs . A familiar THROATY CROAKING SOUND , along with a strange SKITTERING , like the world 's biggest cockroach . <p> Karen turns to the staircase to see  --  <p>  --  KAYAKO , crawling down the stairs . Still wrapped in the plastic sheeting , she moves like a wounded animal , neck hanging limply , struggling to pull herself forward  --  <p>  --  her eyes locked on Karen , CROAKING horribly  --  <p> Karen sorrow turns to abject terror . She tries to lift Doug 's body and pull it to the front door . It 's too heavy . <p> And KAYAKO is getting closer . <p> Sobbing , Karen drops Doug and falls back against the front door , bumping into  --  <p> THE GAS CANS . The one Nakagawa unscrewed TIPS OVER , spilling gasoline into the entryway . <p> As Doug 's arm flops to the floor , his outstretched HAND lands next to Karen . She sees something clenched in his fingers  --  <p>  --  his ZIPPO LIGHTER . <p> Realization dawns over Karen as she feels the liquid spilling onto her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaches forward , trying to loosen Doug 's grip on the lighter as  --  <p>  --  Kayako reaches the bottom of the stairs . Her broken neck makes a horrific CRACKING as she swivels to face Karen . <p> Karen finally gets the lighter . She pushes back against the door with legs too numb to stand . Her eyes drift up to see  --  <p>  --  TOSHIO , watching from the railing above , as before , his cold eyes locked on hers . <p> Karen grabs another can , and spins the lid until it pops off . She tips it onto the floor , spilling more gas . <p> Kayako does n't seem to care . She crawls over Doug 's body and pulls herself through the gasoline , slowly , drawing inexorably closer  --  <p> Karen drops the empty gas can and opens DOUG 'S LIGHTER . <p> She flicks it . Nothing . <p> Karen tries the lighter again . And again . Nothing . <p> Kayako reaches out , blood dripping from her gaping mouth  --  <p> The lighter CATCHES . <p> Karen flails with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  just as Kayako GRABS HER ANKLE . <p> Karen reaches outside , anchoring a hand to the door frame  --  <p>  --  but she ca n't pull herself free , as  --  <p>  --  Kayako pulls herself closer , her CROAKING intensifying  --  <p>  --  resigned , Karen slowly lowers the flame to the gas can  --  <p>  --  and ignites the gas ! There 's a sudden BRIGHT FLASH that overtakes the screen  --  <p> FADE TO WHITE : <p> 132 OMITTED 132 <p> 132a EXT . THE HOUSE - NIGHT 132a <p> The flashing lights of POLICE CARS wash over the formerly quiet neighborhood , illuminating  --  <p> KAREN . She 's lying on a gurney , regaining consciousness . Japanese EMTS are speaking to her as she 's being loaded into the back of an ambulance . <p> KAREN 'S POV : the blurry forms of FIREMEN rush by in slow motion . Everything is dizzy and incoherent ... <p> Karen tries to sit up  --  but a YOUNG EMT lays a gentle hand on her arm , deftly sliding a needle under her skin . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the gurney , her eyes rolling back in her head . She 's fading fast . <p> 132b INT . AMBULANCE - NIGHT 132b <p> The EMTs secure the gurney inside and close the doors . Karen fights the drug , but its grip is inevitable : she finally gives up , sliding into a medicated sleep . <p> We slowly MOVE IN on her face , until it fills the screen . <p> Then ... <p> 132c INT . AMBULANCE - DAY 132c <p> ... the light CHANGES . Darkness becomes morning sunlight spilling across Karen 's face . The tranquil sound of birds CHIRPING surrounds us . But it sounds like a distant echo . <p> Karen 's eyelids flutter . She opens her eyes and sits up , now wide awake  --  but peaceful and calm . <p> She gently swings her legs from the gurney and walks to the window , confused by the daylight . She looks out to see  --  <p> 132d EXT . THE HOUSE - DAY 132d <p> It 's the most beautiful we 've ever seen it . A lush springtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> VOICES off-screen ( Japanese ) are audible , getting closer  --  <p> ON KAREN , as she is surprised to see ... <p> KAYAKO . Beautiful and meek . She 's smiling , walking hand-in-hand with TAKEO . A happy couple . <p> As they reach the front door and go inside , Kayako turns back to the front gate . She smiles and gestures , " come on " . <p> And then TOSHIO walks forward , through the gate . His attention is on a tiny BLACK KITTEN in his arms . <p> At the door , Toshio turns to look back over his shoulder  --  <p>  --  DIRECTLY AT KAREN . They hold each other 's gaze for a moment , as if he somehow sees her in the ambulance . <p> Then Kayako gestures to Toshio , and he turns away , entering The House and closing the door . <p> CUT TO BLACK . <p> # THE END # <p> 133 OMITTED 133 <p> 134 OMITTED 134 <p> 134a OMITTED 134a <p> 135 OMITTED 135 <p> 136 OMITTED 136 <p> 137 OMITTED 137 <p> 138 @
