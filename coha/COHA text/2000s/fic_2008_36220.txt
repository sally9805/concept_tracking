The Stranger in the Snow <p> " A horse ! " the temple lad cried as he ran in panting for breath . " Quick , come and see . " <p> " Why ? " I asked without looking up . I was in the middle of writing , which I did every morning . My scribbles never reached anyone outside this dim , falling-down hut , but that 's of no matter . <p> " Because he 's huge . Hurry , or somebody might steal him . " <p> " Before you do , you mean ? " <p> The boy was so excited that he kept sloshing his bucket of hot water on the floor . He was permitted to barge into the hut to fill my bath just after dawn . <p> I frowned at him . " What about detachment ? " <p> " What ? " he asked . <p> " I thought the priest was teaching you not to get so excited . " <p> " That was before the horse . " <p> If you were born high in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where would this one be from ? The Western empire probably , where huge black stallions are bred . The locals knew animals by the compass . Elephants come from the south , where the jungle begins , and camels from the eastern desert . In all my travels , I had seen only one of these gray monsters , who are like walking walls . <p> From the north , over the passes , came small , furry ponies , and these were very common  --  traders used ponies to reach the villages with their goods : hemp , silk , incense , salt , dried meat , and flour . The bare necessities plus the silk to adorn a bride in joy or wrap a corpse in sorrow . <p> I set the ink-laden brush back on its stand and rubbed the black from my fingers . " You 'd better put that bucket down before you drown us both , " I said . " Then fetch my cloak . " <p> Outside , a storm had swooped down off the high peaks overnight , batting at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fresh snow . I emerged from the hut and looked around . <p> More than a horse is here , I thought . <p> The temple lad could n't stand to wait for me and rushed down the trail . <p> " Find the stranger , " I shouted . <p> The boy whirled around . I was calling with the wind , and at these altitudes my voice could be heard at a long distance . <p> " What stranger ? " the boy called back . <p> " The one who fell off the horse . Search for him . Search hard , and do n't dawdle . " <p> The temple lad hesitated . He much preferred gawking at a fine huge horse , but finding a body in the snow had its own appeal . He nodded and turned the corner out of sight . The boulders on either side of the trail were large enough for a grown man to disappear into , much less a scrawny boy . <p> I proceeded slowly after him , but not because of age . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest long ago . But I can still move without creaking . <p> I had foreseen the mysterious stranger two days earlier , but not the overnight storm . The snow would n't kill him , but the blast of frigid air that howled off the peaks most likely would . Nobody from the world below anticipates that kind of cold . I 've helped the villagers rescue the stranded travelers who were fortunate . Only their noses and toes were blackened . They were numb at first after being dragged to shelter , but started screaming with pain as soon as the rescuers warmed them up . <p> Everyone in my valley has enormous respect for the high peaks and their dangers . But they also revere the mountains , which remind them of how close Heaven is . I do n't need the comfort of Heaven . <p> The villagers did n't call on me for rescue work anymore . It disturbed them that an old ascetic who looked like a crooked teak carving could trek in his bare feet when theirs were bound in layers of goatskin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , and they decided that I had made a pact with a demon . Since there were thousands of local demons , a few could be spared to look after my feet . <p> I walked down the trail until I heard a faint distant sound in the wind , more like a rodent squeak than a boy 's voice . But I understood its meaning . I veered left where the sound came from and hurried my steps . I had a personal interest in finding the stranger alive . <p> What I found when I came over the next ridge was a mound in the snow . The temple lad was staring at the mound , which did n't move . <p> " I waited for you before kicking it , " he said . His face held that mixture of dread and relish that comes over - people when they think they 've discovered a corpse . <p> " Listen to me . Do n't wish him dead . It does n't help , " I warned . <p> Instead of kicking at the mound , the lad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stranger had managed to bury himself under a foot-thick layer of snow , but that was n't as surprising as something else . When I finally saw his outlined body , the man was crouched on his knees with clasped hands folded under his chin . The boy had never seen anyone in that posture before . <p> " Did he seize up like that ? " he asked . <p> I did n't reply . As I gazed at the body , it impressed me that someone could remain praying to the point of death . The position also told me that this was a Jew , because as you travel east , holy men sit cross-legged when they pray ; they do n't kneel . <p> I told the boy to run down to the village for a sledge , and he obeyed without question . In truth the two of us could have carried the body out on our own . But I needed to be alone . As soon as the temple lad had disappeared , I brought my mouth close to the stranger 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frost . <p> " Stir yourself , " I whispered . " I know who you are . " <p> For a moment nothing happened . To all appearances the stranger remained frozen , but I did n't embrace him to give him warmth from my own body . If this was the visitor I was expecting , it was n't necessary . But I granted one small concession . I called the stranger by name . <p> <br> Continues ...
