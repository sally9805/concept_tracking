Section : 2006 Investment Guide Stocks &; Bonds Why the smartest investors make the dumbest decisions . <p> TERRY R. HORN VERY NEARLY CALLED A PRIVATE DETECTIVE before investing with John H. Whittier in November 2004 . But then he thought , " Why bother ? " The promising young hedge fund manager had all the right credentials  --  UC , Berkeley graduate and onetime analyst at Donaldson , Lufkin &; Jenrette . His father was a former executive at Intel who could give Whittier the scoop on promising high-tech stocks . Besides , Horn was giving Whittier only $3 million , just a slice of the $130 million in the cash account at PNM Resources , a utility in Albuquerque , N.M. , where he is acting chief financial officer . <p> Still it stung when he learned he 'd been had . On Oct. 7 , 2005 Wood River Capital Management , Whittier 's hedge fund firm , disclosed that it owned 40%  --  4.3 million shares  --  of Endwave Corp. , which makes wireless transceivers and whose price had plunged 74% between July and September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No dice . Days later the Securities &; Exchange Commission sued Whittier , accusing him of betting more than 65% of his hedge fund on a single risky tech stock , which the agency claimed violated promises that the fund would be broadly diversified and not concentrated in " an extraordinary position in one small-cap stock . " ( Through his lawyer , Whittier insists he did n't defraud anyone . ) Among the red-faced investors who got scorched was an unnamed client of BNP Paribas who tried unsuccessfully to yank $49 million from Wood River before it collapsed into receivership . " We went into it knowing these things are risky , " says Horn , who claims a 17% annual return on his hedge fund investments , including the Wood River wipeout . " Sometimes some of them go wrong . " <p> Sometimes unnecessarily . There were plenty of signs that Whittier was skating close to the edge ; a little due diligence would have unmasked his unpaid taxes and the lawsuits accusing him of failing to pay for securities his fund had purchased . Yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family connections . How could he have failed them ? " He was part of the information network , and people thought that would translate into returns , " says Richard Klitzberg , a hedge fund consultant who was familiar with Whittier 's pitch but did n't represent the fund . <p> What makes smart investors so dumb ? <p> Greed , of course . They would n't be in this game if they did n't hope to rake it in . But we 're talking about sophisticated investors who rarely take people  --  or balance sheets  --  at face value . Avarice alone ca n't explain why so many of them fall for flimflammery , from hedge funds and secretive offshore commodities pools to ordinary Ponzi schemes . How , for example , could a buyout artist like Thomas H. Lee be taken in by Phillip Bennett , the Refco chairman eventually caught hiding ( so say prosecutors ; Bennett denies the charge ) $430 million in bad debt ? <p> A certain predisposition to folly is hard-wired into the human species . Decision making means processing an immense amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Authority , scarcity , consensus , social proof  --  these are relatively primitive decision-making strategies we deploy , " says Robert B. Cialdini , a professor of psychology at Arizona State University and author of Influence : Science and Practice ( Allyn &; Bacon , 2000 ) . In other words , we 're all susceptible to suggestions by influential people ; we gravitate to something if it seems to be unavailable to everyone else , and we trust strangers who appear to be like us . <p> How well do these " weapons of influence " work ? One of Cialdini 's students ran an experiment in which customers of a meat wholesaler were exposed to three different stories : The first group heard the standard sales pitch about high-quality meat ; the second , that beef prices were rising because of a drought in Australia ; the last , that the wholesaler heard from a confidential source within the Australian weather service that a drought was expected and that could drive up beef prices . Orders from the third group were six times those of the first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this irrational desire to jump at what 's scarce or rare , " Cialdini says . <p> PEOPLE LIKE US <p> One of the most effective  --  and potentially dangerous  --  shortcuts is relying on someone 's family background and pedigree as proxies for reliability . Investors in Samuel Israel III 's Bayou Management learned that painful lesson when the hedge fund turned out to be little more than a vehicle for Israel to squander money on bad trades and personal expenses . <p> A Tulane University dropout who had worked at several money-management firms , Israel hardly had the qualifications to run a $450 million hedge fund ( prosecutors are still trying to determine how much money he took in ) . But he had something even more valuable than job experience in the clubby world of finance : his name . Israel 's relatives were well-known traders in New Orleans and New York who had sold ACLI , a large commodities brokerage , to Donaldson , Lufkin &; Jenrette in 1981 . " His family was legendary in the business , " says John Mauldin , president of Millennium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerleader for Israel 's fund because he liked Israel 's investment style . Mauldin helped promote Bayou with a glowing profile in his client newsletter in 2002 that called Israel " a winner , one of those guys who are driven by the love of the game . " A lot of folks fell for it , including advisory firms like the Hennessee Group . <p> And yet , there were red flags everywhere . Israel claimed he had been " chief trader " for money manager Leon Cooperman when he was , in fact , little more than an order-taker . Randy Shain of First Advantage CoreFacts , which investigates money managers for institutional investors , punctured that myth with a single phone call to Cooperman in 2001 . " The fact that he got any money in the beginning is hard to believe , " says Shain . <p> Some investors were gulled by the steady returns . Israel drew in more money by claiming he was getting 17% a year through rapid short-term trades . " That was singing the song I wanted to hear , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bayou in early 2003 . " If they 'd said 50% , I would have run like a scalded cat . " <p> Israel was making up the numbers . He and an associate pleaded guilty to fraud this fall after regulators seized Bayou 's last $100 million as Israel was on the verge of gambling it on a fanciful international lending scheme . <p> FRIENDS IN NEED <p> How about trusting a buddy with your money ? That 's how Thomas Frame lost $4 million in a $330 million pyramid scheme run by his pal and onetime business partner , James Hillman , a pillar of the Oakland , Calif . Jewish community who formed a real estate lending operation called PinnFund with Michael Fanghella . It invested in preapproved subprime mortgages that could be flipped quickly to a bank to produce a 17% annual dividend to investors . In fact , the fund was using lines of credit to buy mortgages and was losing money , paying out old investors with new investor contributions  --  and diverting funds to the two partners . Fanghella was sentenced to ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wire fraud and awaits sentencing . <p> At first Frame had no reason for suspicion . He 'd known Hillman for 25 years , and they had vacationed together with their wives in Vermont ; each served as trustee for the other 's children . " There was a lot of cocktail talk " about PinnFund , Frame says . Without hesitation , he kicked in $200,000 in 1996 , and kept upping his kitty . PinnFund 's consistent returns raised an eyebrow . " You 'd think there would have been some months of a downturn , " Frame says . <p> He grew concerned that PinnFund was growing too quickly : If those subprime loans blew up , would n't his investment be vulnerable to creditors ? Frame , who was buying and selling securities and once ran a real estate syndication business with Hillman , hired an accounting firm to study the business . But when the firm tried to interview PinnFund employees , Fanghella always insisted on being present , saying he was protecting the firm 's proprietary interests . <p> Frame 's anxiety turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PinnFund had processed $8 billion in subprime mortgages in 1999 . Digging further , Frame found a report on the Internet that PinnFund had done only $700 million worth of loans that year . He phoned Hillman , who told him the fund had processed $700 million a month in business . Tormented by the discrepancy , Frame began sending letters to low-income borrowers who supposedly had mortgages in which PinnFund had invested  --  and found that some customers did n't exist . " I was sweating bullets , " he says . " I still thought , ' There 's got to be a logical answer , ' " Frame says , but he asked for half his money back in December of 2000 anyway . The SEC shut the fund three months later , before he could recover a dime . " I take responsibility for my own stupidity , " Frame says . <p> Could he have stopped himself ? " At some point everyone becomes committed , when we go over the line , and we 're part of this and we have to make it work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at George Mason University . " Once I have put my life savings into this thing , I 'm saying , ' Dear God , it ca n't go wrong . ' Then you 're in denial . <p> PEER PRESSURE <p> " Stepping over that line is easy when you fall into the trap of conformity . Cialdini 's research has shown that hotel guests are 27% more likely to comply with requests to reuse bath towels , for example , if there is a sign suggesting that previous occupants of that same room did the same , instead of one that simply makes a plea for the environment . " You follow the lead of people like you , " Cialdini says . <p> Money managers are not that different . Michael Lauer 's Lancer funds sucked in more than $1 billion from investors like the Edmond de Rothschild bank in France and Luxembourg ( $11 million ) , Kuwait &; Middle East Financial Investment ( $25 million ) and AXA Group ( $14.8 million ) . In a 2003 suit the SEC accuses Lauer of investing in dicey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just before the close of each month . <p> Lauer 's biggest haul came from the insular French-speaking business community in Quebec , where investors lost more than $300 million . None of those investors would comment on the record , but the chronology is clear from a lawsuit against PricewaterhouseCoopers and Banc of America Securities , which investors accuse of abetting Lauer 's alleged scheme . ( Lauer , who is representing himself in the litigation over his fund , says he did n't do anything wrong . ) <p> The connecting thread is the Universit de Montral , where many of Canada 's business executives were trained and still teach classes . A portfolio manager there named Germain Bourgeois first recommended Lancer in 1998 , and the university and an affiliated school eventually sank $83 million into the fund . Bourgeois then left to work for cable-television magnate Andr Chagnon , who invested another $137 million between family accounts and his private foundation . Bombardier put in $68.5 million from various pension accounts , and the National Bank of Canada and a large association of credit unions invested $10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's investment committee and now advises the Tremont Capital Opportunity Trust , a hedge fund of funds  --  says he was misled by Lauer 's seemingly high returns . <p> That so many investors followed the university 's lead is no surprise to Klitzberg , the hedge fund consultant who also lost money in Lauer 's fund . " There 's a lemming effect , " he says . Once money managers hear a colleague has invested , " they tend to think most of the due diligence work has been done . <p> IT 'S WHO YOU KNOW <p> " Thanks to a successful graphic design business in New York City , Robert Pellegrini had built up a net worth of $12 million , including a winery on Long Island . In April 1999 his personal trainer at a SoHo gym introduced him to a stockbroker named Robert Pellegrini . Eberhard was a frequent guest on CNBC and on CNN 's Lou Dobbs Tonight , and claimed to be investing for Steve Jobs and Donna Karan , and a friend of Michael Bloomberg . The trainer boasted about the 20% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was intrigued . " I was getting 8% to 9% from my broker , " he says . " I started to give him some of my money , and eventually I gave him all my money . " <p> Meeting at monthly " cheeseburger lunches " with Eberhard , Pellegrini discussed everything from investment theories to his mother 's farm , which sold venison to the same restaurants that bought Pellegrini 's wine . Pellegrini got monthly statements from PaineWebber and later Pershing that indicated his account was declining ; at the same time Eberhard , he says , was showing him phony statements that indicated his account was growing . <p> But he grew suspicious after spotting a $250,000 investment in a hedge fund called Stone House , instead of the millions of dollars he says Eberhard claimed he had invested in the fund . He called Eberhard and got a rambling explanation . Then in February 2002 Pellegrini got a more revealing call from the U.S. Attorney 's Office in New York . The prosecutor said Eberhard was a polished swindler who had blown most of his investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand the cash to Eberhard rather than to a well-known bank or brokerage firm ? Especially since it is so easy to set up a brokerage account that gives a stock picker the right to make trades but no ability to make withdrawals ( see ' Stop That Broker ' ) . <p> Pellegrini lost $8.5 million in the scam . Last June , after pleading guilty to 11 counts , Eberhard was sentenced to 13 years in prison . <p> THE LAST ONE IN <p> Another powerful draw : the fear of getting left behind . Experiments have repeatedly shown that people  --  even professional currency traders  --  bid up investment prices to insane levels if they believe somebody else will pay even more . " In the short run it is rational to go with the crowd " and get in early , says Urs Fischbacher , economist and game theorist at the University of Zurich 's Institute for Empirical Research in Economics . <p> But in the long run it 's a prescription for asset evaporation . Kenneth Londoner was a respected former fund manager with J.W. Seligman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which ran multiple hedge funds , starting in 1997 . Soon he claimed to have more than $950 million and was boasting returns of 37% a year . " What drives it is word of mouth , " says a New York hedge fund manager who bought into Red Coat but sold out before many of his friends did . " Once a person with a good reputation recommends it , it spreads like wildfire . " <p> Soon word of Londoner 's hot hand got out to retail investors . Despite a December 2000 article on TheStreet.com , in which Londoner admitted to having a " challenging " year  --  it turned out later that his investments were down 70%  --  CIBC Oppenheimer promoted a new Red Coat fund in its Los Angeles office in early 2001 , in part because Londoner promised to double its sales commission take from Red Coat . ( That agreement is detailed in memos cited in a lawsuit accusing CIBC of promoting Red Coat without proper investigation ; CIBC denies this . ) <p> Murray Gomer , a retired attorney and CPA , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invested $200,000 in early 2001 on the advice of his broker , adding $50,000 in October after Red Coat reported a 65% monthly return  --  startling for a fund that supposedly held a balanced mix of long and short positions . Gomer is an experienced investor , but he missed the improbability . The eye-popping returns came from a heavily leveraged bet on a single high-tech medical company , E-Medsoft.com , which went bankrupt in 2002 . <p> " Other people who were smarter said , ' If they 're up 65% , there 's something wrong , ' " Gomer says now . One of those smarter people , according to a letter cited in the CIBC lawsuit , was the manager of its Los Angeles office , Richard Wiseley . He pulled his $100,000 out of Red Coat , in violation of a one-year lock-in agreement , at the same time that Gomer was putting more money in . <p> Gomer was relatively lucky . He and nine other investors sued CIBC Oppenheimer and recovered $3.6 million , or 70% of their losses .
