<p> The Big Red Balloon <p> <p> What were the British doing on Mars ? <p> <p> For one thing , they had no difficulty calculating with metric figures . For another , their space exploration effort had not been fueled primarily by a military-industrial complex . This meant that it had never received infusions of taxpayers ' money on the huge scale of certain other nations , but also meant that its continued existence had been unaffected by bungled wars or inconvenient peace treaties . Without the prospect of offworld missile bases , the major powers ' interest in colonizing space had quite melted away . This left plenty of room for the private sector . <p> <p> There was only one question , then : was there money on Mars ? <p> <p> There had definitely been money on Luna . The British Lunar Company had done quite well by its stockholders , with the proceeds from its mining and tourism divisions . Luna had been a great place to channel societal malcontents as well , guaranteeing a workforce of rugged individualists and others who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Luna was pretty thoroughly old news now and no longer anywhere near as profitable as it had been , thanks to the miners ' strikes and the litigation with the Ephesian Church over the Diana of Luna incident . Nor was it romantic anymore : its sterile silver valleys were becoming domesticated , domed over with tract housing for all the clerks the BLC needed . Bureaucrats and missionaries had done for Luna as a frontier . <p> <p> The psychiatric Hospitals were filling up with unemployed rugged individualists again . Profit margins were down . The BLC turned its thoughtful eyes to Mars . <p> <p> Harder to get to than Luna , but nominally easier to colonize . Bigger , but on the other hand no easy gravity well with which to ship ore down to Earth . This ruled out mining for export as a means of profit . And as for low-gravity experiments , they were cheaper and easier to do on Luna . What , really , had Mars to offer to the hopeful capitalist ? <p> <p> Only the prospect of terraforming . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of effort , with the successful result being a place slightly less hospitable than Outer Mongolia in the dead of winter . <p> <p> But what are spin doctors for ? <p> <p> So the British Arean Company had been formed , with suitably orchestrated media fanfare . Historical clichTs were dusted off and repackaged to look shiny-new . Games and films were produced to create a public appetite for adventure in rocky red landscapes . Clever advertising did its best to convince people they 'd missed a golden opportunity by not buying lots on Luna when the land up there was dirt cheap , but intimated that they need n't kick themselves any longer : a second chance was coming for an even better deal ! And so forth and so on . <p> <p> It all had the desired effect . A lot of people gave the British Arean Company a great deal of money in return for shares of stock that , technically speaking , were n't worth the pixels with which they were impressively depicted in old-engraving style . The big red balloon was launched . Missions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and actual scientists were sent out to the new colony along with the better- socially-adapted inhabitants of two or three Hospitals . So were the members of an incorporated clan , as a goodwill gesture in honor of the most recent treaty with the Celtic Federation . They brought certain institutions the British Arean Company officially forbade , like polluting <p> <p> The Empress of Mars industries and beast slavery , but conceded were necessary to survival on a frontier . <p> <p> So all began together the vast and difficult work of setting up the infrastructure for terraforming , preparing the way for wholesale human colonization . <p> <p> Then there was a change of government . It coincided with the British Arean Company discovering that the fusion generators they had shipped to Mars would n't work unless they were in a very strong electromagnetic field , and Mars , it seemed , did n't have much of one . This meant that powering life support alone would cost very much more than anyone had thought it would . <p> <p> Not only that , the lowland canyons where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with devastating velocity . Only in the Tharsis highlands , where the air was thinner and colder , was it possible to erect a structure that would n't be scoured away by sandstorms within a week . The British Arean Company discovered this after several extremely costly mistakes . <p> <p> The balloon burst . <p> <p> Not with a bang and shreds flying everywhere , exactly ; more like a very fast leak , so it sort of dwindled down to an ignominious little lopsided thing without much air in it . Just like the dome of the Settlement Base . <p> <p> So a lot of people were stuck up there without the money to come home , and they had to make the best of things . Under the circumstances , it seemed best to continue on with the job . <p> <p> Excerpted from The Empress Of Mars by Kage Baker . Copyright 2009 by Kage Baker .
