Are virtual wedding bells about to chime for America Online and Microsoft ? Senior execs from AOL and Time Warner ( which owns AOL and TIME ) have been meeting with Microsoft officials for several months , trying to work out a deal that could unite AOL with Microsoft 's MSN network . The talks , which were first reported in the New York Post , have risen to the highest levels of both companies , involving direct discussions between Time Warner CEO Dick Parsons and Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer , says a source close to the talks . Negotiations are now at an impasse over key technology issues , such as whose instant-messaging platform would be used . But a variety of proposals remain on the table , including the creation of a separately traded company . " We could take a more modest approach with co-marketing agreements , " the source tells TIME , " but the bias is , if we 're going to do this , let 's really play to win . " <P> Why get together now ? Microsoft and AOL fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vied for dial-up customers before broadband took off . Today they 're losing billions in ad revenues to Google and Yahoo . By consolidating their websites into a mammoth network , they could sell ads across the board . Hooking up would be a defensive play too . Google raised $4.1 billion in a stock offering last week and has been encroaching on Microsoft 's most precious turf , the computer desktop . Microsoft is worried about falling further behind Google in the Web-search races and would love to get AOL to replace its Google search engine with Microsoft 's . The AOL unit could fetch as much as $20 billion on the market , and spinning off a piece in a joint venture with Microsoft would ease the pressure on Time Warner 's Parsons to generate higher returns for shareholders . There 's no word yet on a prenup.  --  By Daren Fonda
