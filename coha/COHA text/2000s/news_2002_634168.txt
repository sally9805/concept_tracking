<p> The dust had yet to settle on Florida 's hanging chads when a new buzz phrase entered the lexicon of White House watchers and even ordinary citizens who actually had better things to do : " appearing presidential . " Let 's see if we 've got this right : From his very first post-inauguration speeches , President Bush has been said to seem as if he may be someone who might be the actual president . It 's enough to leave one wondering if we are n't perhaps expecting too little from the leader of the free world . <p> All that aside , the desire to appear presidential has been around for longer than the current resident of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave . But acting like a president has generally been the task of actors attempting to , well , act . It goes back to at least 1915 , when Donald Crisp appeared as Ulysses S. Grant in D.W. Griffiths ' " Birth of a Nation . " <p> ( It 's worth noting that the one actor who actually became president , Ronald Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he appear presidential , although that Bonzo fellow had the high sheen of a future cabinet member . ) <p> In honor of Presidents ' Day , which will be marked on Monday , here 's a look at what happens when the presidential seal gets the Hollywood seal of approval . <p> Privileged Executives <p> The United States has had 43 presidents to date , but of those 43 , only four have made a graceful trek from Pennsylvania Avenue to Hollywood and Vine . Following is a quartet that  --  good or bad  --  has had Hollywood do justice to their legacy . <p> John F. Kennedy  --  The 35th president has been done to death and beyond , what with Cliff Robertson in " PT-109 , " William Devane in " The Missiles of October " and Martin Sheen in 1983 's " Kennedy . " ( In fact , Sheen has played Bobby Kennedy as well , in " The Missiles of October , " and worked the Oval Office as president Josiah Bartlet on TV 's " The West Wing " and as Michael Douglas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With all that Hollywood insider experience , does n't that make sons Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen the perfect pair to play as J- and RFK ? And would n't that put the so-called Kennedy and Bush dynasties to shame ? Make room , Beltway , for the Sheen Monument ! ) <p> One thing , though : What with all these films focusing on JFK , there has been nary a mention of Marilyn Monroe , Jayne Mansfield , Angie Dickinson , Blaze Starr or Judith Campbell Exner . Seems odd , does n't it ? Where is the star power ? <p> Richard M. Nixon  --  The bizarre paranoia of the 37th prez has launched a veritable Hollywood cottage industry . Nixon , in fact , has provided work for every dark-haired , swarthy actor this side of Dan Hedaya . Oh wait , that 's right , Hedaya , the man who shot to trivia fodder as Carla Tortelli 's neanderthal ex-husband Nick , played Tricky Dick in " Dick . " <p> In addition , there 's Phillip Baker Hall in the Robert Altman-directed one-man show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hopkins ' over-the-top turn in Oliver Stone 's " Nixon " and Lane Smith 's inspired weirdness in the made-for-TV adaptation of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein 's The Final Days . ( When Smith turns to Theodore Bikel 's Henry Kissinger in the film 's last act and urges the secretary of state to pray with him , why , that 's Hollywood magic on a scale with some of John Waters ' finest moments . ) In addition , notable man-in-black Rip Torn played the man from Whittier , Calif. , in the telepic of John Dean 's " Blind Ambition . " <p> That 's nothing , though , compared to the indignity of being played four times from the mid- ' 70s to the early ' 80s , by one Richard M. Dixon . <p> Nixon 's died , but , through the magic of Hollywood , rest assured we 'll still have Richard Nixon to kick around years from now . <p> Bill Clinton  --  Speaking of kicks , it was clear to all that **31;1263;TOOLONG John Travolta got his playing a transparently veiled William Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Primary Colors . Savagely funny and witheringly prophetic , the film gave us <p> the making of the candidate with more than the barest suggestions of Clinton 's alleged indiscretions , Hilary 's Lady Macbeth machinations and campaign schemer James Carville 's out-and-out weirdness . And all this was in the 1992 primaries , before Kenneth Starr , Henry Hyde and , oh yes , Monica Lewinsky had made their runs at strange fame . Imagine the film fun yet to come . <p> Harry S.Truman <p> How could Hollywood overlook a haberdasher who went on to hold up a copy of Chicago journalism 's biggest gaffe and  --  oh yeah  --  drop the atomic bomb ? And indeed , the man from Independence has made it to the big screen and small repeatedly . Ed Flanders , the beleaguered hospital administrator on TV 's late , lamented St. Elsewhere , had a nice little side job going radiating earnest integrity as Truman three separate times . ( Flanders , it should be noted , is several steps up from Richard M. Dixon . ) <p> The A-bomb prez has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , notably James Whitmore 's Oscar-nominated performance in the one-man show Give Em Hell , Harry and Blue Island 's own Gary Sinise in Truman . <p> Presidential Unpardonables <p> A handful of chief executives have been done not-so-secret disservices by the dream factory in California . <p> Abraham Lincoln <p> Hollywood is anything but the land of Lincoln . Sure , you 've got Henry Fonda in Young Mr. Lincoln . And board-stiff but still iconic Gregory Peck in TV 's The Blue and the Grey . But after that , Lincoln on film is a monumental load of , well , bad celluloid . The venerable Raymond Massey , did a decent turn in 1939 's Abe Lincoln in Illinois . Then he dined out on the ol ' railsplitter three more times , once with Ruth Gordon  --  yes , Ruth , Harold and Maude Gordon as Mary Lincoln . And Massey 's not the worst of the repeat offenders . What Ralph Ince , George A. Billings , Frank McGlynn and Charles Middleton did to the memory of Honest Abe should land them front-row seats in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from now , one can only hope some sort of film will do justice to one of the nations greatest presidents . <p> Thomas Jefferson <p> The third president and most fatherly of the founding fathers is best remembered on film for purportedly fathering a child with his 15-year-old slave , Sally Hemings . And while this makes for magnificent speculation among filmmakers and historians  --  and allows Nick Nolte and Sam Neill to wear silly wigs  --  does n't the man who wrote the basic draft of the Declaration of Independence and was the principle architect of our democracy deserve something just a little bit better ? <p> Ulysses S. Grant <p> The hard-drinking , hard-driving general who was instrumental in the Union 's victory in the Civil War gets elected president and what happens ? Harry Morgan , James Gregory and one of the great players of psychopaths , Anthony Zerbe , are what has happened to Grant . What 's buried in Grant 's tomb ? Any realistic hope of a thoughtful film , that 's what . <p> Coming soon to a multiplex near you ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the rise . <p> Theodore Roosevelt <p> A hot book by Edmund Morris , Theodore Rex , may raise the profile of America 's 26th president high enough to get a film deal heated up . And why not ? War hero , survivor of an assassination attempt , and brave warrior against corrupt big business . In the age of Kenny Boy Lay and Enron , is this a no-brainer or what ? And performances by Whit Bissell and Brian Keith are hardly definitive . <p> John Adams <p> Adams , too , is the subject of a popular and respected new bio , by David McCulloch . And maybe that will be enough to raise interest in this founding father and second president . Then again , Adams is almost infamous for his lack of infamy . No boozing , no cheating , no carousing , so maybe this is n't such a good idea . Still , portrayals by Burgess Meredith , Pat Hingle , Frank Langella , Robert Preston and David McCallum have left plenty of room for an Adams for all time . <p> Ronald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gipper 's name on just about everything else in the country that does n't move ; why not a major motion picture ? ( The Day Reagan Was Shot just does n't count as a major motion picture . Major irritation , well , that 's another story . ) Plenty of candidates , but Clint Eastwood might do a nice job . Or Judi Dench . <p> Two presidents who will never be the subject of films  --  but should <p> Andrew Johnson <p> What with the travails of the most recently impeached chief executive , should n't the man who blazed the impeachment trail get some big-screen consideration ? Gary Cooper would have been a dead ringer . Harry Dean Stanton or Sam Waterston in a John Sayles ' ( Eight Men Out , Matewan ) - directed film would be a winner . <p> James Buchanan <p> His fiancee , Anne Caroline Coleman , killed herself with an overdose of laudanum . There were whispers that he was gay , and papers that may have confirmed this were destroyed unopened by the executors of his will upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies . <p> Two presidents who will never be the subject of films  --  and thank heavens . <p> Calvin Coolidge <p> He cut the national debt by about $2 billion and reduced federal taxes three times . Still , Coolidge was a man of few words , so few , in fact , that upon his death , Dorothy Parker is reported to have quipped , How could they tell ? <p> William Henry Harrison <p> Old Tippecanoe caught pneumonia at his inauguration and died 35 days later . Sounds more like a bad Saturday Night Live skit than a movie .
