Writing fiction can cause hallucinations . In one that appeared before me last winter , I was 17 years old again , a nervous high school student with an overbite , wearing a paper bib around my neck and lying back in a large chair . After gargling with minty liquid , I opened my mouth wide and looked up , and looming above me , holding a gleaming metallic instrument , was Keanu Reeves . That was disconcerting enough , but even odder was the realization that we were not alone but were being watched by hundreds of moviegoers at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah . <P> That hallucination will be playing on a dozen American movie screens this weekend as Thumbsucker , the independent movie based on my novel . Like most writers , I had always dreamed of having one of my books made into a film , but I had never expected that it would be the one about my most tender adolescent secret : the oral fixation that I tried to hide from others until I was old enough to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , was replaced by a host of more troubling obsessions ( some of them involving illegal substances ) . Writing this often mortifying story had made me feel vulnerable enough , but when Hollywood called to show interest in filming it , I wondered whether my psyche would survive . <P> When a book becomes a movie , the novelist goes from author to spectator  --  always a bewildering transition , even more so when the book in question is based on his life . For me the process began about four years ago , three years after the novel 's publication , when writer-director Mike Mills invited me to his house in California to discuss his adaptation of the book . He had shortened the time span of the narrative , combined several young female characters into one and focused on the protagonist 's complex relationship with his unhappy mother . He had improved my work , in other words , and I knew from the moment I read his script that his movie might be better than my book . <P> The artistic and psychological shocks continued when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ore. , where he was re-creating my upbringing ( or my fictional version of it ) , using people who were much better looking than I remembered . Lou Taylor Pucci , who plays Justin ( the character I had modeled on myself ) , is shorter and darker-haired than I am , but his aura and manner were so weirdly familiar that I shivered when I shook his hand . I shivered again when Pucci winked at me and popped his right thumb into his mouth , performing the act without any of the embarrassment that still haunted me as a fortyish adult . <P> Meeting Audrey , my quasi mother , was even stranger . Tilda Swinton had a Scottish accent in her trailer but spoke like a born American when the cameras were turned on . Her performance was so convincing that when the actors took time out for lunch , I found myself confiding in her about a romantic breakup I was suffering through . Writing autobiographical fiction , it 's often said , is therapeutic for a novelist , but it 's nothing compared with spilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posing as one 's parent .
