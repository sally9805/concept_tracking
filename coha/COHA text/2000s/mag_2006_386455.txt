African-American women are on the front lines of improving health care // Growing up in Nigeria , Olufunmilayo Falusi Olopade , M.D. , was urged by her father , a minister , to become a doctor . " He realized that the health of his congregation was poor , " says Dr. Olopade . " He kept encouraging me . He saw a need among our people . That floats what I do . " Honoring her father 's wishes , she studied medicine in Africa and later in the United States . Today she is director of the Center for Clinical Cancer Genetics in the Department of Medicine at the University of Chicago Hospital . Inside one of her two labs that are stocked to capacity with rubber gloves and test tubes , Dr. Olopade has been advancing the area of cancer genetics through tireless research to find out why Black women develop breast cancer earlier than White women . Nixing the idea that the cause may be environmental factors such as poverty and lack of health care , she determined that Black women developed a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetic factors . Dr. Olopade also challenged the long-held belief that breast cancer is one single disease . " Now that we know why some women are so much more likely to get breast cancer , we can do something about it , " says Dr. Olopade , who is working with doctors in Nigeria to study the gene in African women . The groundbreaking research earned Dr. Olopade the MacArthur Foundation 's genius award of $500,000-money that will help her continue her work here and in Africa . Dr. Olopade is an example of the African-American women who are making a difference in health care and who are having a significant impact in medicine by addressing issues such as breast cancer , substance abuse , AIDS , and providing care for underserved individuals . However , medical officials say there still are not enough African-American doctors graduating from medical schools around the country and less than 10 percent of medical school faculty members are Black . According to the 2004 data provided by the American Medical Association , 8,437 female doctors are categorized as being AfricanAmerican ( out of 235,627 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , M.D. , dean for diversity and community partnership at Harvard Medical School since 2002 , is hoping to change . As many colleges , particularly those in the health and science fields , struggle with diversity among students and faculty , Dr. Reede 's job includes providing an oversight for diversity efforts that relate to the medical school and affiliate hospitals and include faculty , residents , fellows , students and staff . " There have been challenges , but I do n't think that they are unique to Harvard , " say Dr. Reede . " One of the major issues has been trying to help people understand the importance of collaboration , so that it 's not Harvard alone trying to address issues of diversity in academic medicine . You have to look at it from a perspective of being across academic levels . For example , unless you have students who are graduating from high school and able to complete college , you do n't have the students who can apply to medical school . " Dr. Valerie Montgomery Rice , M.D. , a graduate of Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicine at Meharry Medical School in Nashville , Term. , agrees . " The pipeline to medical school clearly has to start early , " Dr. Rice says . " If you never see Black doctor , you never know that you can be one . In the first , second and third grades we have to teach them that they can be physicians . " At Meharry , which was founded in 1876 to train Black doctors , Dr. Rice has implemented some major changes , including doing more cutting-edge research inside the newly developed Center for Women 's Health Research . The research includes studying why more women of color are afflicted with fibroid tumors , and at an earlier age . The college is also working on a new weapon in AIDS prevention , a chemical condom , which would protect women from contracting the disease . Dr. Rice , who once had ambitions to be an engineer , is enthusiastic about what the AIDS medical breakthrough could mean , especially for women living in African countries where the disease continues to spread . Attending a historically Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. Tanner , M.D. , who has been in practice for 50 years . She attended Fisk University at the insistence of her father , who was a physician . " My dad said , " You need the Black experience . You must go to Fisk , ' ' " recalls Dr. Tanner , who lived in Chicago at the time . She later transferred to the University of Chicago , where she was one of only a few AfricanAmericans living in the dorm . She then decided to go to Meharry College , where she met her husband , a surgeon , and was trained in pediatric pathology . Dr. Tanner , 84 , currently works at the Children 's Hospital of Michigan and maintains a positive bedside manner with patients . " I 'm just a little girl from Mississippi trying to make a difference , " she says . " I have the satisfaction of helping people by doing my job . I like helping people . " Another doctor on the front line doing battle in health care is Regina M. Benjamin , M.D. Dr. Benjamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alabama . As former associate dean for rural health at the University of South Alabama College of Medicine , she is in the process of building her third clinic in Bayou La Batre , a small shrimping village on the Gulf Coast . Hurricane George destroyed her first clinic in 1998 . After rebuilding on higher ground , the new clinic building was devastated by Hurricane Katrine last year . Once again , Dr. Benjamin rebuilt the clinic , yet it was destroyed by fire earlier this year . None of the past events has deterred Dr. Benjamin , who attended Xavier University in New Orleans and was a member of the second class at the Morehouse School of Medicine . You 'll find her driving her truck to make house calls to see patients in the community . " I always did house calls , " she says . " What was different after Katrina is that we were under 25 feet of water , and 20,000 people did n't have homes . That was the difference . " And , yes , she will rebuild her clinic again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The job itself is rewarding , " she says . " The people . The patients . Our patients are like family . I find that there 's nothing like the smile when a patient is happy or just feeling better . It 's worth getting up every day . " Whether it 's affording health care , or the problem of drugs and alcohol abuse that continues to plague the African-American community , the need for strong Black leadership is key . Beverly Watts Davis , senior advisor on substance abuse policy for the Substance Abuse Mental Health Service Administration ( SAMHSA ) , has been outspoken on the topic . The organization 's 2004 report states that 19.1 million Americans ( 7.9 percent ) of the population over the age of 12 were illicit drug users . " Because I am passionate about having drug-free communities , " she says . " Sure we could turn this around with drug prevention for African-American kids in our communities . Our children deserve better .
