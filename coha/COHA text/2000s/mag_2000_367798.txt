For Paula Marshall-Chapman , 47 , CEO of the Bama Companies , a $140 million Tulsa , Okla. , frozen-dough-and-pie concern that started in her grandmother 's kitchen in 1927 , the road to success has been studded with familial potholes . When Marshall-Chapman took over from her father in 1984 , her two brothers were furious that they would not be involved in running the show . The business was changed from a corporation to a partnership , with Marshall-Chapman named general partner . Her parents Lilah and Paul Marshall took their equity out of the business to live on . The structure of the general partnership left the business strapped for cash , and for the first time , Bama was forced to take on debt and cut back on its distribution network . <P> " My father saw me as the most likely person to take over the business , " says Marshall-Chapman , and she has n't done badly at all . Bama employs 750 people and has about a 10% annual growth in revenues . But she acknowledges that " my brothers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the business . If we had all just sat down and discussed everyone 's needs and expectations , we might have been able to structure things differently and without such hurt feelings . " Marshall-Chapman is in the process of buying out the minority shares of one of her brothers , and time has healed some of the wounds in the family . <P> For Marshall-Chapman and the other owners of nearly 13 million family-owned businesses in the U.S. , the decision about how to pass the corporate torch gracefully to the next generation is an exercise in reason over emotion , usually coupled with legal wrangling and considerable financial finesse . From the elder generation 's point of view , you want to make sure you will be taken care of in your golden years . At the same time , the business must be passed on in a way that helps ensure both its continued success and the financial welfare of the younger generations who rely on the venture to pay the bills . The longer a business stays in a family , the harder this becomes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a 40% chance of surviving , second to third generation have a 15% survival rate , and the number dwindles down to 1% from third to fourth generation , says John Messervey , principal consultant with the National Family Business Council , a consulting-and-research group in Lake Forest , Ill . Compounding all this is the fact that as many as 25% of senior family-business shareholders do not complete any estate planning other than writing a will , according to the Family Firm Institute
