One Patrick and I became friends because of a vegetable . Not just any vegetable . A cabbage . And not just any old cabbage . A Korean pickled cabbage . Which is n't a round cabbage like Peter Rabbit would eat , but a longer , leafier kind . It gets cut up and salted and packed in big jars with lots of garlic , green onions , and hot red pepper , and then it 's called kimchee . Kimchee is really spicy . Koreans eat it for breakfast , lunch , and dinner . I do n't like kimchee . My mom says that when I was little , I used to eat it . She 'd rinse off the spiciness and give me a bite or two . When I got to be six or seven years old , she stopped rinsing it . Most Korean mothers do that , and most Korean kids keep eating it . Not me . I hated the spiciness , and I still do . My mom keeps telling me I should eat it because it 's refreshing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on fire ? My family used to tease me about not liking kimchee . My dad said maybe it meant I was n't really Korean . ' We should have your DNA tested , ' he 'd tell me . The seven-year-old snotbrain named Kenny who lives with usotherwise known as my little brotherwould wave big pieces in front of me and threaten to force me to eat them . Another thing about kimchee is , it has a really strong smell . Even though it 's stored in jars , you can still smell it , right through the jar and the refrigerator door . It sends out these feelers through the whole house . Three years ago , when I was in fourth grade , we were living in Chicago . I 'd made friends with a girl named Sarah . The first time she came over to play , she stopped dead in theentryway and said , ' Eww ! What 's that smell ? ' I 'd never really noticed it . Smells are funny that waythey can sort of disappear if you live with them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was really embarrassed . The exact same thing happened again a few weeks later , this time with two friends , a boy named Michael and his sister , Lily . They both stopped dead in their tracks and grabbed their noses . Then they insisted that we play outside because they could n't stand the smell . I asked my mom to stop making kimchee , but she told me I was being unreasonable . When we moved to Plainfield two years ago , our new apartment did n't smell like kimcheefor about half a day . Then my mom unpacked some groceries , including a big jar of kimchee . Sigh . I met Patrick on our second day in Plainfield , a Saturday morning . Actually , I saw him on the first day ; he was hanging around on his front steps three doors down , watching the movers . Not just him but his three brothers as well . I noticed him right away , not because of the way he lookedbrown hair in a normal boy-haircut , a few freckles , a gap between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed to be the closest to my age . The other three boys were little , younger even than Kenny . On the second day , I took a break from unpacking and went out to have a good look at the neighborhood . There they were again , the four boys , like they 'd never moved off the steps . This time there was a girl with them , too , but she was a lot older . Patrick came down the steps and said hello and told me his name . I said hi back told him mine . ' Can I see inside your house ? ' he asked . ' Sure , ' I said . As we started down the sidewalk , we were suddenly surrounded by his three younger brothers . ' Can we come , too ? ' ' Patrick , we wan na see . ' ' Patrick , what 's her name ? ' Patrick stopped walking . ' Claire ! ' he yelled . The girl on the steps looked up from picking at her nails . ' Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , ' Patrick said . ' I ca n't go barging in with all of them . ' ' I 'm leaving soon . Michelle is picking me up to go to the mall . ' ' Well , that means I 'll be looking after them then . So you take them for now . ' Claire stood up . ' YOU BEEN ICKY ! ' she yelled . At least , that was what it sounded like to me , but later I learned that their names were Hugh , Ben , and Nicholas , and that Hugh was a year older than Ben and Nicky , who were twins , and that they usually got called ' Hugh-Ben-Nicky ' all in one breath . ' Aw ' ' Patrick ' ' Pleeeeease can we ' ' Hugh , let 's go see if there are any cookies , ' Claire said . Hugh let go of Patrick 's arm and turned back toward their house . Ben and Nicky trotted after him . Patrick grinned at me . ' If you get Hugh to do something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained . As we walked in the door of my house , Patrick tilted his head and sniffed . I braced myself for his reaction . ' Whoa , ' he said . ' What 's that ? It smells great ! ' That was the beginning of Patrick 's love affair with kimchee . Whenever he eats dinner with us , my mom puts one bowl of kimchee on the table for the family and gives Patrick a whole private bowl for himself . mouthfuls , sometimes without even adding any rice . I can hardly stand to watch him . Maybe he 's the one who needs his DNA tested . ' Goats . ' ' No . ' ' Sheep . ' ' No . ' ' Swine . ' ' Wine ? ' Patrick and I were sitting on the floor of my room . He was reading aloud from a pamphlet . I was sewing up one of the cushions I keep on my bed . It had split the week before when we had a pillow fight , and the stuffing was falling out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they 'd let us anywhere near alcohol ? Anyway , we 've already decided to do an animal project . Wine is not an animal . ' Patrick and I had just joined the Wiggle Club . Its real name is the Work-Grow-Give-Live ! Club ( Plainfield Chapter ) , which means its initials are WGGL , which is why all the kids call it Wiggle . The Wiggle Club is supposed to teach kids about farming . Or at least it started out like that , a long time ago . It used to be for kids who lived on farms , far apart from each other , and it gave them a way to get together . These days , hardly anyone lives on farms ; most of the land has been taken over by giant companies . Then the Wiggle clubs got started in cities and suburbs , so now we have one in Plainfield . That 's what Mr. Maxwell told us , anyway . He 's the guy who runs the Wiggle Club , and he owns one of the only small farms left near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a project . They work on it for months , and the best ones get chosen to be exhibited at the state fair in August . Now it was March , and everyone else in the club had been working on their projects for a couple of months . Patrick and I signed only a week ago , so we were going to have to work fast . We 'd just attended our first meeting , where we decided we 'd do an Animal Husbandry project . ' Mr. Maxwell ? ' Patrick had waved his hand . ' Why is it called Animal Husbandry ? Are we only allowed to work with male animals ? ' Mr. Maxwell laughed . ' No , Patrick , we work with both male and female animals . It 's called husbandry because it 's raising animals , taking care of them ' Patrick interrupted him . ' Then why is n't it called Animal Wifery ? Wives take care of stuffI mean , like raising babiesmore than husbands do , do n't they ? ' Patrick is n't a rude person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas sort of pop out of him like he does n't have any control over them . His question made Mr. Maxwell pause a second . ' Hmm . I think maybe it 's because the word ' husband ' has another meaning , one that not many people use anymore . It means to guard or watch overlike if someone 's resting , we say they 're ' husbanding their strength . " Patrick thought it over . He said , ' Okay , I get it . But would n't it be fairer just to call it Animal Parentry ? ' That made Mr. Maxwell laugh again . ' That would be fairer . Maybe you could start a campaign to change it . In the meantime ' He handed Patrick a Wiggle pamphlet on Animal Husbandry projects . Patrick began reading it right away . He loves to read . He goes to the library all the time , and if he reads something interesting , he absolutely has to tell me about it . Once , when he was reading late at night about crows , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imitate sounds like car engines or dogs barking , he told me afterwardthat he forgot how late it was and called me . My dad answered the phone and yelled at him . So now when Patrick 's excited like that , he sends me an e-mail instead . Wiggle meetings are held in the community recreation building a few blocks away from where I live . When the meeting ended , we walked to my house . We went up to my room , and that was when Patrick started reading the pamphlet out loud to me . Patrick and I went through the whole list of animals . It was discouraging . Most of them were big farm animals , and the rest were ordinary petsdogs , cats , hamsters . We could n't pick dogs or cats because the townhouses we live in do n't allow pets that are n't in cages . ' We could do a hamster project , ' Patrick said doubtfully . ' Bo-o-o-rring , ' I said . I needed one more piece of thread to finish sewing up the cushion 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held up the needle , and took a deep breath . I always want to thread a needle on my first tryit 's a thing with me . I poked the thread at the needle 's eye . Bingo . ' Reptiles , ' Patrick said . ' Reptiles are more interesting . Maybe we could raise some kind of ... of snake . No , not snakeslizards . Lizards would be cool . ' I pulled the thread halfway through and knotted the ends together . ' I do n't think so , ' I said as I started stitching . ' My mom hates snakes , which means she probably would n't be too keen on lizards , either . And a snake at your house ? ' I snorted and shook my head . Patrick nodded . ' Gak , ' he said , which is what he always says when he 's frustrated . ' Yeah , you 're right . ' Both of his parents work , so during the day his grandmother looks after the family . Patrick is the third oldest , after Claire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best she can , but nothing , and I mean nothing , is safe from those three . Patrick shares a bedroom with his three brothers , and ages ago he started storing all his important stuff at my house . My mom does n't mind , because he 's very tidy about it . He even leaves his backpack here most days , and picks it up every morning when we walk to school . It 's easy , because we always do our homework together anyway . ' Maybe we should do a gardening project instead , ' Patrick said . ' Remember that girl Mr. Maxwell told us about who grew three different kinds of strawberries , and made jam from them , and wrote about which made the best jam ' ' Bo-o-o-rring , ' I said again . ' Well , do n't forget , Jules , she won a prize at the state fair . ' Patrick usually calls me Jules , which I kind of like . Everyone else calls me Julia . A long time ago I tried out ' Pat ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did n't seem to fit . ' Yeah , but not for the gardening , ' I said . ' She won a ribbon for the jam . For the cooking partyou know , that cooking and sewing category . ' ' Domestic Arts , ' Patrick said . ' But it was still a really good project . Mr. Maxwell said so , because it counted in two categories , Gardening and Domestic Arts . I wish we could think of an animal project like that . ' Patrick looked at the alarm clock on the bedside table . It was almost five o'clock . ' I 'd better go , ' he said . Now that his older sisters are in high school , they 're almost never home , and Patrick usually helps his gram give Hugh-Ben-Nicky an early supper . He stood up and put the pamphlet next to the clock . ' I 'm leaving this here . Read it before you go to bed . I 've already read it , so I 'll think about it . Maybe one of us will wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Patrick 's favorite theories . He read somewhere that people remember stuff better if they read or think about it right before they fall asleep . We always try to study for a test together at bedtime , on the phone or by instant messaging . I glanced at the pamphlet as we left the room . It would probably take a while before I got around to reading it . I do n't like to read , not the way Patrick does . Besides , he reads enough for both of us . I 've got another story to tell you , and I 'm going to do it here , between the chapters . Every story has another story inside , but you do n't usually get to read the inside one . It 's deleted or torn up or maybe filed away before the story becomes a book ; lots of times it does n't even get written down in the first place . If you 'd rather read my story without interruption , you can skip these sections . Really and truly . I hereby give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning about how this book was written background information , mistakes , maybe even a secret or twoyou 've come to the right place . Some people like that sort of thing . It 's mostly conversations between me and the author of my story , Ms. Park . We had a lot of discussions while she was writing . Here we go . Me : Why am I named Julia ? Ms. Park : You 're named after my sister . Sort of . Her name is Julie . Me : What about Patrick ? Ms. Park : Oh , that 's just a name I like . But his character is partly based on a boy named Mark who lived across the street from me when I was growing up . Mark had five or six brothers and sisters , and he always had some kind of project going . I liked hanging out with him and was sad when he moved away after only a year in the neighborhood . I guess writing about Patrick is a way for me to spend more time with Mark . Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story ? Do you already know the ending ? Ms. Park : I have a general idea of how I want the story to go , but nothing definite yet . Really just you and Patrick and the Wiggle projectthat 's all I 've got so far . Me : Hmm . It looks like you could use some help . Good thing I 'm here . And I have one more question . That part about the friends who thought the house smelled awful . Did that really happen ? Ms. Park : To me or to you ? Me : To you , of course . I know it happened to me . Ms. Park : Yes . But it happened to me in third grade , not fourth grade . Me : Is that , like , legal ? To change stuff like that ? Ms. Park : It is if you 're writing fiction .... Fiction is about the truth , even if it 's not always factual . I changed the fact about the grade , but not the truth about the feelings . Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay , do you see how this is going to work ?
