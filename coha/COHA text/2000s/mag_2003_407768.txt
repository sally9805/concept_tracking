In Beantown , art museums get a face-lift , new hotels spring up , and high tea is de rigueur . BY CHRISTINA IANZITO // Think you know Boston ? The city that 's a brain trust of universities and research hospitals , the Yankee town that 's steeped in early American history , a darn good place to get some " chowdah " ? All true , still . But have you been here lately ? Next year the Museum of Fine Arts breaks ground on a glassy new East Wing , and the Institute of Contemporary Art begins work on a new waterfront home . Stylish hotels are popping up all over Beacon Hill and near the formerly tawdry Theater District . A grand new convention center is under construction , anticipating the flood of Democratic Conventioneers arriving in July 2004 . Local historian Robert Allison says that while Boston does have a reputation for being conservative ( if not stodgy ) , people here are actually quite open to change . " Bostonians embrace the past , they do n't simply shred it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , you 'll find many innovations have come from this city-the mutual fund , the telephone , not to mention the American Revolution and transformation of government . " Then there 's the " Big Dig " - the ongoing 14.6-billion-dollar project to sink the conspicuous elevated highway that splits the waterfront from the rest of the city and replace it with a system of tunnels and bridges . This enormous undertaking , many say , is what 's shaken this city out of complacency in the past few years . You ca n't help focusing on the future when your front yard is a massive construction site . FAST FACTS Boston 's population is 600,000 , joined every September by 167,000 college students , attending the metropolitan area 's 47 colleges-and who keep the place hopping except for a few quiet summer months . Logan Airport is just across the harbor , a short cab ride from downtown , or for $10 the Airport Water Shuttle bounces between the Logan dock and Rowes Wharf , offering a stoplight-free entry into the city . Use the subway-called the T-or , better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a walking city , and much of what 's not to be missed is within strolling distance in the various neighborhoods that give the area its character including , Back Bay , Beacon Hill , the North End , and the South End . DO N'T MISS History here is never far away . Wherever you wander , you 'll cross paths with the Freedom Trail , a two-and-a-half-mile walk through America 's colonial past , from Boston Common to the Bunker Hill Monument in Charlestown and the Old North Church in the Italian North End . There are other iconic Boston experiences worth considering , though : a visit to Boston Common and to the Public Garden to see the swan boats ; hearing the Boston Pops play on the Fourth of July ; or watching the fall regatta known as the Head of the Charles ( October 18-19 ) , the world 's largest two-day rowing event . For whale-watching tours , Boston Harbor Cruises has naturalist-guided cruises to Stellwagen Bank . The North End is one of the jewels of Boston and worth an extended visit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and merchant neighborhood since 1630 and solidly Italian since the 1920s-somehow managing to stay authentic even today , despite the influx of young urbanites . A culinary/historical tour of the area is led by Michele Topor , a chef who 's lived in the North End for 30 years . She 'll lead you through shops to taste biscotti , limoncello , and prosciutto , including a stop at Polcari 's Coffee , which Topor calls " a real old-world shop selling 27 varieties of coffee beans and more than a hundred different herbs and spices . " On the artistic front , the Museum of Fine Arts boasts a permanent collection that encompasses Hopper , Renoir , Cassatt , Turner , and Monet , along with a large collection of Asian art . Special exhibitions in the works include " Rembrandt 's Journey " ( Oct. 26-Jan. 18 ) , which displays the artist 's range as an etcher , draftsman , and painter . This year marks the 100th anniversary of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum , home to the vast collection amassed by Gardner , a passionate art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ museum announced this year that anyone named Isabella is offered free admission for life ) . The works-Sargent to Velazquez to Titian-are displayed in her 15th-century Venetian-style palace a block and a half from the MFA . On weekends ( Sept. - May ) , classical music concerts are held in the museum 's Tapestry Room , and lunch is served daily ( except Mon. ) in the small cafe . WHERE THE LOCALS EAT " I 'm a late-night eater , " says chef Todd English , of Olives fame , and his favorite stop is Teatro , a cavernous spot located in the Theater District . The kitchen is open until midnight and the food by popular local chef Jamie Mammano is " modern-rustic Italian " - antipasti and grilled pizza for starters , and main courses such as spinach and mascarpone ravioli with creme fraiche and parsley . A few blocks from Teatro is Mantra , a cosmopolitan restaurant serving Indian-French fusion cuisine that was voted best new restaurant by Boston magazine last year . The pan-roasted cod is served with a coconut and ginger sauce , and the caramelized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty left of old Boston , though , best represented by the Union Oyster House , billed as America 's oldest restaurant . Situated on the Freedom Trail near Faneuil Hall , it 's a local landmark that 's been selling New England seafood since 1826 . Legend has it that Daniel Webster would regularly stop in to consume three dozen oysters , with brandy , for breakfast . JFK came on Sundays for lobster stew . " Locals are our bread and butter , " says owner Joe Milano . " Ted Kennedy was in the other day , the mayor was here last week , and Senator John Kerry has a lucky stool that he sits on during election nights . " A sweet after-dinner stop is Finale Desserterie , the result of a field study by a trio of Harvard Business School students . One , Kim Moore , says they concluded that a plush dessert cafe with candlelight and offerings like molten chocolate cake could n't fail . They were right , and there 's now a Finale in the Theater District and in Cambridge . NIGHTLIFE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two BosTix booths-at Faneuil Hall and Copley Square-on the day of the show . The 2003-2004 season will feature hits like Urinetown and Hairspray . Beyond the Theater District , though , is the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge , a nonprofit company that gets kudos for its renditions of works by Mamet and Shakespeare ; September brings Chekhov 's Lady with a Lapdog . And catch concerts at Boston Symphony Hall , the acoustically acclaimed venue that goes back 103 years . The Boston Symphony Orchestra will play here once the season begins on October 2 . TOP SHOPPING The city 's best shopping is down tree-lined Charles Street ( which separates the Common from the Garden ) , for boutique clothing stores and a long line of antique shops . Wish has racks full of women 's fashions from the likes of Trina Turk , Shoshanna , and Milly . Marika 's Antiques is a mishmash of unique old jewelry and china , while Stephen Score Antiques is great for whimsical folk art . On the west side of the Public Garden is Newbury Street , home to everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Burberry , but the art galleries along this strip are one-of-a-kind . Lynda Saltz , art editor for the Newbury Street and Back Bay Guide , suggests the Barbara Krakow Gallery for contemporary art from artists like Sol LeWitt and Jenny Holzer . To see works from some of New England 's finest painters , Saltz recommends checking out the nearly 90-year-old Guild of Boston Artists . Vose Galleries of Boston , established in 1841 and run by the fifth generation of Voses , has four stories of works by 18th-and 19th-century American painters . Booklovers should head to Harvard Square in Cambridge for its eclectic mix of bookstores specializing in everything from literature to comics to architecture . Since 1927 , the Grolier Poetry Book Shop has thrived on poetry alone . LODGING There 's been an infusion of chic little hotels here lately , joining the quaint B &Bs; such as A Cambridge House , Bed &; Breakfast Inn near Harvard Square , which offers evening hors d'oeuvres and Victorian ambience , and the established and luxurious types like the Boston Harbor Hotel . The latter is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms with views of the Boston skyline and water . There 's a health club with a spa , and the Airport Water Shuttle drops off guests at the hotel 's dock . The Beacon Hill Hotel &; Bistro sits one block from the Public Garden on Charles Street . It 's decorated with black-and-white photography by Daniel Jones , plantation shutters , and flat-panel TV monitors . The bistro is a cheery place for breakfast , included in the price . Located in the Financial District , Nine Zero is the much talked about new 190-room boutique hotel in the 21st century vein-bold colors , complimentary Internet access , and in-room printers-with a progressive French restaurant called Spire . Sidebar Two for Tea Our picks for a Boston Tea Party . Bostonians have always enjoyed their tea , and , despite the ascension of Starbucks , there are still places to linger over a cuppa here , none more classic and princessy than the Ritz-Carlton , Boston . The hotel , recently renovated to its former elegance , is a 76-year-old landmark that once received notables like Winston Churchill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll get the whole package : floral couches surrounded by antiques , Wedgewood china , currant-and-orange scones with Devonshire cream , and cucumber and salmon sandwiches . As a counterpoint , across the park sits the two-year-old Ritz-Carlton , Boston Common , its modern sister with an Asian-inspired tea lounge . It 's decorated with muted earth tones and a wall-size fireplace , and tea is served with dim sum delicacies. - C.I . Sidebar Hitting a Homer Havin ' fun in Boston 's other park . I ca n't think of anything more ' Boston ' than a Red Sox game , " says Jay Heaps-and this from a Major League Soccer player ( Heaps plays with the New England Revolution ) . It 's undeniable that Boston is a sports-loving town , and the Red Sox are its pride and heartache , still malingering under the fabled " curse " that descended upon the team when its owners sold Babe Ruth to the Yankees in 1920 . The Sox have n't won a World Series since . But Fenway Park is a classic gem of a ballpark and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catch a game ( 877-733-7699 for tickets ) or tour the park any day of the week ( Fenway Park Tours , 617-236-6666 ) . - C.I .
