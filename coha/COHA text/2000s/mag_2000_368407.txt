While other journalists have been attending events and writing stories here in Sydney , I figured out what America really wants to know about the Olympics  --  as little as possible . So I focused on spending my time and expense account at restaurants , beaches , the zoo and even , by mistake , a museum . <P> After a while , I longed for a buddy to freeload with . That 's when I saw Eric Moussambani , the athlete from Equatorial Guinea who swam in the first heat of the 100-m freestyle . After the other competitors were disqualified for jumping at the " on your mark " part , Moussambani had to swim alone . Moussambani had never even come close to swimming two pool lengths before . Halfway through the race , he started flailing and seemed in danger of drowning . But he prevailed , clocking in at 1:52.72 . That 's 1:04.08 longer than it took gold-medal winner Pieter van den Hoogenband and 50.27 longer than Moussambani 's closest competitor , the 70th-place swimmer from Bahrain . It turns out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to swim . <P> Because Sydney , as part of the bid that brought the Olympics to the most ridiculously located country in the world , promised to fly any athlete to the Games , Moussambani was able to get free airfare , housing at the Olympic Village and food at the cafeteria . This guy was my idol . <P> Better yet , Moussambani was being feted as a hero . The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that he exhibited the true Olympic spirit , not once using the phrase " ballsy hucksterism . " The Today show did an interview ; the Olympic Committee took him to lunch and put him on a postcard ; Speedo bought him a uniform . The way I saw it , Moussambani was more than a hero ; he was a name I could put on my expense account . So last Friday I offered to take him to 41 , one of the most expensive restaurants in Sydney . He accepted , then called later to say he could come only if I took all three of his fellow Equatorial Guinean athletes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Despite the language barrier , we all enjoyed the five-course meal , and it turns out we have much in common . Sure , Moussambani has never read TIME , and I have no idea where his country is , but we both know how to work it . He and his fellow swimmer Paula Barila Bolopa , who swam the 50-m in 1:03.97 , doubling the second worst time , had received money to be interviewed by Australian papers . And Moussambani had already turned down an ad campaign . " Speedo offered to sponsor me , but I did n't like the contract , " he said , eating baked Alaska as the waitress came over with a stack of menus to be signed . " Michael Johnson was here two days ago , and we did n't ask for his autograph , " she said . After signing , the team stopped for some photo ops with diners , then headed back to the Olympic Village . Moussambani promised to call me next year , when he hopes to be invited to a swim meet in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After that , I figure , Moussambani can write self-obsessed columns while I competitively doggy paddle .
