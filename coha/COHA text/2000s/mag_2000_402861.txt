Section : Militarize Space NOW ! Wasteful and inefficient , with no clear mission , NASA has become just one more massive federal bureaucracy  --  HUD with booster rockets . <p> The laws of government , like the laws of physics , apply everywhere  --  whether on earth or in the dark reaches of outer space . When governmental bodies are funded without strict measurable objectives and deadlines , the result will be waste , pork , corruption , and incompetence . <p> So it is with NASA . When President Eisenhower created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on July 29 , 1958 , it was a shining testament to the power and grandeur of big government in its infancy . The space agency 's first " big hit " was in February 1962 when John Glenn became the first American to orbit the earth . Its next big success , indeed NASA 's crowning achievement , was the first manned lunar landing on July 20 , 1969 . <p> In the 31 years since then , NASA has made fantastic progress . Indeed , its most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1998 , when John Glenn was shot back into space . Hmm ... Something seems amiss . <p> Outer space is a place of numerical extremes . The distances it spans and the amounts of money required to explore it are both measured in digits that make the eyes spin like a slot machine . But while the universe expands at a steady , predictable rate , space budgets have an unnerving tendency to inflate suddenly and dramatically . <p> The answer lies in the simple , commonplace , and lamentable fact that NASA is today as much a federal bureaucracy as the department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) . True , there are some basic differences . Most NASA employees can read , write , and do sums rather well ; NASA is somewhat smaller , and HUD is n't rocket science . But NASA 's primary unofficial purpose , like all federal bodies , is to keep its staff employed . And , like all federal bodies , NASA survives by offering valuable pork to Congress  --  considering that it started with rocket launches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another ( Texas ) , NASA was seemingly created in a pork-barrel . NASA 's two most significant projects  --  the shuttle and the space station  --  serve to illustrate . The Space Shuttle <p> In 1972 , as the Apollo program came to a close , NASA sold the shuttle program as a way to establish routine , low-cost , reliable access to space . Instead of Expendable Launch Vehicles that burned up after take off , Reusable Launch Vehicles could be used again and again , and save money . <p> Thanks to the " cost saving " Reusable Launch Vehicles , the price tag of hefting a pound of payload into space has increased from $3,800 in the 1960 's to $6,000 ( in constant dollars ) . And this is only an estimate . Dr. Alex Rowland , formerly a NASA historian but now a history professor at Duke University , calculates that , once the development and capital costs of the shuttle are factored in , the actual per-pound cost is $35,000 . In other words , the cost of one shuttle flight is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2 billion . International Space Station <p> As it became increasingly obvious that the shuttle program was a commercial bust , NASA needed a mission to justify the shuttle 's  --  and not inconsequentially their own  --  continued existence . Thus , the quest for a new space station . <p> Initially named " Freedom , " the American space station was to measure 500 feet , cost a mere $8 billion , and be launched and ready for activity by 1992 . So over the next eight years NASA went to work , spending $10 billion and producing ... nothing . Nothing but plans . <p> Even Congress could n't ignore such waste  --  at first  --  and the project was slated for termination . But NASA was handed a gift : the collapse of the Soviet Union . Concerned that the defense industry would wither in recession after post-Cold War cutbacks , Congress turned to the International Space Station as the aeronautics contractors ' way station . <p> In 1993 , President Clinton ordered NASA to design a less expensive station that could include Russia as a cost-sharing partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it barely escaped the gravity of congressional objection . In June 1993 a proposal to cut off funding for the station lost by only one vote : 216 to 215 . <p> So NASA did what any good government agency would do : It sat down to reinvent and restructure , from head to toe , its lobbying efforts . It promised to create a " procurement constituency " of 40 states . In effect , NASA offered Congress a jobs and pork bonanza . As Albert Wheelon , a former executive at Hughes Aircraft and member of the 1993 presidential space station commission , summed it up : " The space station is now just a jobs program . " <p> Florida , Texas , and Alabama were already locked in because much of the station work would be done within their borders . Not surprisingly the congressional delegations of all three states were unanimous in their support . The station 's primary contractor is Boeing , with offices in Seattle , Houston , and Huntsville , Alabama . In recent years , however , NASA has spread the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 22 states . The pork was sufficiently succulent to change congressional minds : In 1994 , the space station 's one-vote margin became a hefty 123-vote margin . By 1999 , the margin of victory was secure : 245 votes for pigs in space . <p> The Clinton administration promised that U.S. spending  --  not including the $10 billion that was thrown away during the first eight years of the space station project  --  would not exceed $17.4 billion . But include th cost of Russian holdups ( repairing and updating aging equipment ) and bailouts ( much of which the Russians can not account for ) and the cost comes closer to $25 billion . And that does n't include the additional $15 billion to $20 billion for shuttle flights to ferry the station 's parts out to space . <p> Add the expected two decades of expensive consulting and repair work and the total price tag for the U.S. component of the International Space Station becomes upwards of $96 billion , says the General Accounting Office . <p> Allowing the pedestrian facts of economics and politics to hinder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NASA . The pro-NASA response-patter is bound tightly with notions of real scientific and technological progress . Through NASA , it is said , the nation can invest in its future . <p> Yet NASA is n't exactly a stepping stone to technological advancement . Already NASA has sacrificed planned scientific shuttle and satellite projects in order to throw more resources at the International Space Station  --  a triumph of public relations and politics over hard science , particularly since the space station is so scientifically unnecessary . NASA even sacrificed planned biological experiments on the station itself to compensate for cost overruns in building the station . Clearly the pursuit of knowledge is slipping down this project 's priority list . <p> Which is one reason why many American scientists oppose the space station . Another reason is that space research itself is far more cost effective when done by satellites and unmanned probes  --  most of which can be launched for the price of a single space-station resupply mission ( and that 's just using NASA 's figures ) . About the only research the International Space Station will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space . And we already have much data on this from Russia 's Mir space station  --  though even if we did n't one wonders if it would be worth close to $100 billion . As the special presidential advisory commission set to evaluate NASA 's space station plan stated in 1991 , " We do not believe that the space station ... can be justified solely on the basis of the non-biological science it can perform , much of which can be conducted on Earth or by unmanned robots . " <p> The chairman of the commission neglected to mention that some of NASA 's experimenting in space is fairly worthless science to begin with : What does it matter whether spiders spin their webs differently in zero gravity ? What value is there in redundant zero-gravity fluid control experiments ? Why spend hundreds of millions of dollars discovering the effects of weightlessness on an aged John Glenn ? <p> Or take the " Mission to Planet Earth . " MTPE was initially established by President Bush in an effort to appease environmentalists . Its goal , as expanded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of global warming by having a dozen satellites hovering around the planet taking the earth 's temperature . All this despite the fact that NASA 's satellite data has consistently demonstrated that the phenomenon does not exist . Project cost : $33 billion over 25 years . <p> Typical of NASA 's scientific experiments is the gallium arsenide ( GaAs ) semiconductor wafer project . The GaAs wafer is used in producing the GaAs computer chip . NASA was convinced that a superior GaAs wafer could be produced in space  --  the zero-gravity would promote a nearly perfect crystal structure . So NASA spent a whopping $2.5 billion on five shuttle flights to make five GaAs wafers . The cost was about $100 million per wafer versus the $500 per GaAs wafer cost of the conventional terrestrial variety  --  not much of a commercial improvement . According to T.J. Rodgers , CEO of Cypress Semiconductor ( the largest GaAs chip maker in the country ) , since the GaAs computer chip manufacturing process entails destroying and rebuilding the GaAs crystal , NASA 's experiment was based on an entirely asinine hypothesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply ludicrous . " <p> The quest for knowledge will always challenge man 's material and intellectual resources . But until there is a return on our investments into NASA , space exploration wo n't produce any new knowledge , only expensive demonstrations of old truths : Federal bureaucracies swallow taxpayer money whole . In this respect , NASA is better than federal agencies like HUD : At least NASA , at the end of the day , shoots the feeble , feckless fruits of its labor into space . <p> By Josh London <p> <p> Josh London is deputy editor of The American Spectator <p> <p>
