<p> Since 1983 , the first time one of his teams ever reached the postseason , Tony La Russa has watched the sane world of regular season baseball crumble before his studious eyes in October . That year , an obscure Oriole outfielder named Tito Landrum hit a home run in old Comiskey Park to swing the American League Championship Series away from La Russa 's White Sox . His hot team was sent home and Baltimore won its last world title . Ever since , La Russa has seemed luckless at best and perplexed at worst in his many trips to the playoffs . The crucial plays by lesser-known players , the hunch moves by managers that turned out brilliantly , have so often gone against him . <p> Is that about to change ? Is the manager who is famous for taking powerful teams  --  frequently favorites  --  into October , then going home sooner than expected , about to find himself on the other end of the sport 's good fortune ? After Friday night 's 9-6 Cardinals victory to tie this NLCS at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The St. Louis heroes were little-known Scott Spiezio , with a two-run , game-tying triple in the seventh and an insurance-run RBI double in the ninth after a go-ahead homer by So Taguchi . <p> And the man who put them in place to do those improbable deeds was , in both cases , La Russa . Finally , Tony 's hot . <p> For the first time in a career that has brought him 2,297 wins , more than any manager except Connie Mack and John McGraw , La Russa has entered the postseason with a genuinely scruffy underdog team , one which should be hounded by the least imaginable pressure . His Cardinals won only 83 games , 11th best in baseball , and almost performed the worst final-fortnight collapse in baseball history , threatening to out-disgrace the ' 64 Pholdin ' Phillies . However , his Birds escaped that misfortune on the final weekend of the season . Now with second lives , they 've beaten the Padres in the division series and , on Friday night at Shea Stadium , came from behind to steal a crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9-6 . <p> And who was the crucial man in this St. Louis escape from a two-game deficit ? Ostensibly it was Spiezio , the son of former Cardinal third baseman Ed Spiezio , whose two-run seventh-inning triple off reliever Guillermo Mota tied the game at 6 and completely changed the sense of momentum  --  that dastardly , capricious October baseball term  --  toward the Cards . <p> But it was La Russa who played a dramatic hunch before this crisis game by benching slumping third baseman Scott Rolen , a perennial all-star , in favor of the colorful Spiezio , an extrovert who wears what he calls an " imperial "  --  a drooping tuft of lower-lip whiskers that he has dyed Cardinal red . <p> And who hit the decisive game-winning home run in the top of the ninth inning ? Why , Taguchi with a blast over the left-field fence off Mets closer Billy Wagner . How did he get in the game ? Why , naturally , La Russa inserted him in the game for defense  --  not offense . If that 's not a switch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gets home run instead  --  then what would be ? <p> Is this the beginning of a moment of payback , a squaring up of the scales of injustice for La Russa , who has taken teams to the World Series that won 105 , 104 and 103 games in the regular season and lost them all  --  while winning one game in total ? <p> If it is , if in a week it is the underdog Cards who are in the World Series , not the Mets , who were so close to a two-game lead , built on a pair of deflating home runs by Carlos Delgado against the Cards ' Cy Young winner Chris Carpenter , then the slaps on the back  --  rather than the familiar kicks in the pants  --  will go to La Russa for tapping Spiezio and his designated long-shot hero . <p> Make no mistake , La Russa hates the playoffs the way the Pope hates pornography . Maybe the manager ca n't define exactly what when he sees it . The whole format is screwy , build on dumb luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are too many off days and twilight starting times . Why , the postseason barely resembles the righteous regular season when the truth of who 's good and who 's not always comes out in the long run . The whole premise of deciding champions on the basis of five- and seven-game series is a deviant kind of autumn baseball . Unfortunately , his teams often sense how Tony the Purist feels . Sometimes they play like it . <p> This is La Russa 's 12th visit to the playoffs . On nine of those visits , he bossed teams that averaged 99.8 wins in the regular season . Yet Tony was won only one world title . Because La Russa is a natural leader and one of the best ( regular season ) managers ever , his teams mirror his personality . So , many surmise , they hate the playoffs , too . How 's that working out so far ? <p> " Actually it is kind of a tournament , " La Russa said this week of the postseason format . " It is what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather have it that you win the National League pennant and go straight to the World Series without the playoffs . That 's just not the way it is so I do n't even bother to think about it . " <p> Of course he does n't really banish those dark thoughts from his mind . No , not hyper-intense , **65;1396;TOOLONG Tony . Not more than a thousand times a year . <p> After his Spiezio-for-Rolen gut-check , the rest of this NLCS may revolve around La Russa . This was no easy decision . Rolen has been in a slump , but he has also been a symbol of toughness , continuing to play even though he has what seems to be severe shoulder fatigue . And why would n't he ? Rolen played 142 games this season after having surgery that required five screws be put in that shoulder . " It 's not an enjoyable decision , " La Russa said . " But I watched him yesterday . Something is prohibiting his stroke from being right . He has been cleared by the medical staff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been such a central figure in baseball over the last 25 years that his fate in October becomes a recurring subtext of the postseason . Because he 's so smart , yet sometimes too subtle by half , he 's constantly in a boiling pot . <p> In six division series , La Russa is 20-5 , with only one loss . No problem . In 10 LCS , he 's 27-27 with six series defeats , including a blown three-games-to-one lead in ' 96 and an upset by the wild-card Astros last year . Finally , there 's his 5-12 record in four World Series . The conclusion : The more pressure , the worse the results ? That 's the rap . <p> But now , at last , there 's a twist , a switch in an old plot . La Russa runs the underdog , the team that survived an utter collapse . Few things in playoff baseball are more dangerous than a Ghoul Team that have already risen from its grave . Once a team has been left for dead , then finds a way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony La Russa has never had such a team under his command . Does he now ? And did he himself , with Spiezio 's great help , start a change of momentum that may reverse his October curse ?
