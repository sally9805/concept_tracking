READY TO RETURN TO TEXAS AND A ' NORMAL ' LIFE , THE BUSH FAMILY LOOKS BACK ON EIGHT YEARS WITH HEADS HELD HIGH -- AND , THEY SAY , PRINCIPLES UNCHANGED . " You 'd think , on your way out , they 'd only want one picture , " joked the President , even as he gamely struck several poses with his family -- newly expanded to include daughter Jenna 's husband , Henry Hager -- in the Yellow Oval Room of the White House residence . Famously impatient , George W. Bush took his time with this final PEOPLE year-end portrait and interview . When he met with editor Larry Hackett and Washington , D.C. , correspondent Sandra Sobieraj Westfall on Nov. 29 , the conversation was by turns lighthearted and serious , as he reflected on two tumultuous terms in office . Cast yourself back to your Inauguration in 2001 What did you think then your presidency would be about , and how does that stack up now ? THE PRESIDENT : In 2001 I was focused on getting a good team together and dealing with an economy that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education system that needed serious reform . Little did I know that on Sept. 11 , 2001 , our world would change and so would my presidency . I was aware that the unexpected was going to happen . I just was n't , obviously , at the time aware of how big the unexpected would be . Are there regrets , goals you could not achieve because of what happened ? THE PRESIDENT : Two major issues I was passionate about were immigration reform and Social Security reform . I would argue that both those issues did n't happen because of raw politics or risk aversion . Which moments from the last eight years do you revisit most often ? THE PRESIDENT : I definitely think about the families I 've met of the fallen soldiers -- about the compassion , love and determination of the families , to make sure that the Commander-in-Chief hears their stories and knows their pride . I think about throwing out that pitch at the World Series on Oct. 30 2001 My heart was racing when I got to the mound . Did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . My heart was pumping so hard , I was n't sure if I could lift my arm . I never felt that anxious any other time during my presidency , curiously enough . The country is in tough times -- the credit crisis , layoffs , the war . Are Americans worse off now than they were eight years ago ? Does any part of you feel you let folks down ? THE PRESIDENT : I think this country is much more secure today . One of the accomplishments of this administration is to prevent another attack on our homeland and leave in place the tools necessary for our professionals to protect the American people . In terms of the economy , this administration has taken some extraordinary measures to make sure that the financial system does n't melt down and to make sure that the free enterprise system is strong . We go through economic difficulties in our country , and we 'll come out better after this one . Mrs. Bush , are you hurt more by public opinion of your husband than he is ? MRS . LAURA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very strong sense of who we are . In a lot of ways , that 's just chatter out there . THE PRESIDENT : Look , I 've been popular and not so popular . But the thing that matters most in life is not one 's popularity but principles . And I am not going to sacrifice my principles on the altar of political popularity . If you chase popularity , you 'll be a lousy President . If you make decisions based upon sound principles , you 've done your job . Could you have done this job without your wife ? THE PRESIDENT : No , because Laura provides great comfort . She reminds me of realities , like , " Hey , buddy , you volunteered to do this job . " laughter Oftentimes Presidents fall prey to self-pity . There 's nothing more pathetic than self-pity . Laura has been very good about bolstering my spirits . Jenna and Barbara , how have you seen your parents change over the last eight years ? MS . JENNA HAGER : Eight years ago my dad was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little naive about how people would treat him here . But he 's never wavered in his decisions and he 's the same as he was when we were little , his ethics . So that 's something to be proud of in itself . MS . BARBARA BUSH : They 've stayed the same to us and they have the same ethics that they had all their life . THE PRESIDENT : I thought you 'd say my hair got grayer. laughter MS . HAGER : He 's been under a lot of stress , so we 're ready for him to go back to Texas and be warmly received . Mr. President , does Sarah Palin have a future as a national GOP figure ? THE PRESIDENT : Sure . She was on the stage , and I thought acquitted herself just fine . She will be around . Was part of you happy to witness history , the election of the first African-American President ? THE PRESIDENT : No , I wanted John McCain to win . But once the verdict was in , I was pleased about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they 'd ever see an African-American President . And they were elated to see Barack Obama elected . And I think that 's good for the country , that people now have renewed faith in the system . Barbara , Jenna , any advice for Sasha and Malia Obama ? MS . HAGER : Well , they 're a lot younger than we are , cuter than we are . We 're old news . MS . BUSH : Even the puppy is going to be cuter . laughter We gave them a tour of the White House residence , showed them our little secret , fun places . There 's , sort of , trap doors --  MS . HAGER :  - -  that little kids are fascinated by . It 's a house that can inspire a lot of games and imagination . One of them said , " This will be a great house for hide-and-go-seek . " Henry , what 's it like spending time with your in-laws ? MR . HAGER : It 's been great , because they can be completely down-to-earth , and family time really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out together ? MR . HAGER : We do . We bike together . He usually leaves me. laughter He 's a very good biker . What are you most looking forward to about life after the White House ? THE PRESIDENT : It 's hard to tell , hard to imagine what it 's like to go from 100 miles an hour to 5 . I 'm going to want to build a policy institute at Southern Methodist , probably write a book . And beyond that , I 'm open for suggestions . laughter MRS . BUSH : I look forward to a more normal life . I look forward to the next house that we 're going to have , that will be ours , with our own things in it . As much as I 've loved this , I 'm ready to move on to that next step .
