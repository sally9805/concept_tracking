<p> A LIGHTWEIGHT WIND TURBINE IS FINALLY ON THE HORIZON AND IT MIGHT JUST BE THE BREAKTHROUGH NEEDED TO GIVE FOSSIL FUELS A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY . <p> The newest wind turbine standing at Rocky Flats in Colorado , the U.S. Department of Energy 's proving ground for wind power technologies , looks much like any other apparatus for capturing energy from wind : a boxy turbine sits atop a steel tower that sprouts two propeller blades stretching a combined 40 meters-almost half the length of a football field . Wind rushes by , blades rotate , and electricity flows . But there 's a key difference . This prototype has flexible , hinged blades ; in strong winds , they bend back slightly while spinning . The bending is barely perceptible to a casual observer , but it 's a radical departure from how existing wind turbines work-and it just may change the fate of wind power . <p> Indeed , the success of the prototype at Rocky Flats comes at a crucial moment in the evolution of wind power . Wind-driven generators are still a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But last year , 1,700 megawatts ' worth of new wind capacity was installed in the United States-enough to power 500,000 houses-nearly doubling the nation 's wind power capacity . And more is on the way . Manufacturers have reduced the cost of heavy-duty wind turbines fourfold since 1980 , and these gargantuan machines are now reliable and efficient enough to be built offshore . An 80-turbine , $245 million wind farm under construction off the Danish coast will be the world 's largest , and developers are beginning to colonize German , Dutch and British waters , too . In North America , speculators envision massive offshore wind farms near British Columbia and Nantucket , MA . <p> But there is still a black cloud hovering over this seemingly sunny scenario . Wind turbines remain expensive to build-often prohibitively so . On average , it costs about $1 million per megawatt to construct a wind turbine farm , compared to about $600,000 per megawatt for a conventional gas-fired power plant ; in the economic calculations of power companies , the fact that wind is free does n't close this gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must come down if it 's ever to be more than a niche technology . <p> And that 's where the prototype at Rocky Flats comes in . The flexibility in its blades will enable the turbine to be 40 percent lighter than today 's industry standard but just as capable of surviving destructive storms . And that lighter weight could mean machines that are 20 to 25 percent cheaper than today 's large turbines . <p> Earlier efforts at lighter designs were universal failures-disabled or destroyed , some within weeks , by the wind itself . Given these failures , wind experts are understandably cautious about the latest shot at a lightweight design . But most agree that lightweight wind turbines , if they work , will change the economic equation . " The question would become , How do you get the transmission capacity built fast enough to keep up with growth , ' " says Ward Marshall , a wind power developer at Columbus , OH-based American Electric Power who is on the board of directors of the American Wind Energy Association , a trade group . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> And , say experts , the Rocky Flats prototype-designed by Wind Turbine of Bellevue , WA-is the best hope in years for a lightweight design that will finally succeed . " I can say pretty unequivocally that this is a dramatic step in lightweight wind turbine technology " says Bob Thresher , director of the National Wind Technology Center at Rocky Flats . " Nobody else has built a machine that flexible and made it work . " STEADY AS SHE BLOWS <p> Wind turbines are like giant fans run in reverse . Instead of motor-driven blades that push the air , they use airfoils that catch the wind and crank a generator that pumps out electricity . Many of today 's turbines are mammoth machines with three-bladed rotors that span 80 meters-20 meters longer than the wingspan of a Boeing 747 . And therein lies the technology challenge . The enormous size is needed if commercial wind turbines are to compete economically because power production rises exponentially with blade length . But these vast structures must be rugged enough to endure gales and extreme turbulence . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneers made the first serious efforts at fighting these forces with lightweight , flexible machines . Several startups installed thousands of such wind turbines ; most were literally torn apart or disabled by gusts . Taking lightweight experimentation to the extreme , General Electric and Boeing built much larger prototypes-behemoths with 80- , 90- and even 100-meter-long blades . These also proved prone to breakdown ; in some cases their blades bent back and actually struck the towers . <p> All told , U.S. companies and the Department of Energy spent hundreds of millions of dollars on these failed experiments in the 1980s and early 1990s . " The American model has always gravitated toward the light and the sophisticated and things that did n't work " says James Manwell , a mechanical engineer who leads the University of Massachusetts 's renewable-energy research laboratory in Amherst , MA . <p> Into these technology doldrums sailed researchers from Denmark 's Rise National Laboratory and Danish companies like Vestas Wind Systems . During the past two decades they perfected a heavy-duty version of the wind turbine-and it has become the Microsoft Windows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts for virtually all of the electricity generated by wind worldwide . Perhaps reflecting national inclinations , these sturdy Danish designs had little of the aerodynamic flash of the earlier U.S. wind turbines ; they were simply braced against the wind with heavier , thicker steel and composite materials . They were tough , rugged-and they worked . <p> What 's more , in recent years , power electronics-digital silicon switches that massage the flow of electricity from the machine-further improved the basic design . Previously , the turbine 's rotor was held to a constant rate of rotation so its alternating-current output would be in sync with the power grid ; the new devices maintain the synchronization while allowing the rotor to freely speed up and slow down with the wind . " If you get a gust , the rotor can accelerate instead of just sitting there and receiving the brute force of the wind " says Manwell . <p> Mastering such strains enabled the Danish design to grow larger and larger . Whereas in the early 1980s a typical commercial machine had a blade span of 12.5 meters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's biggest blades stretch 80 meters and crank out two megawatts ; a single machine can power more than 500 homes . <p> The newest challenge facing the Danish design is finding ways for it to weather the corrosive and punishing off-shore environment , where months can pass before a mechanic can safely board and fix a turbine . Vestas , for one , is equipping its turbines with sensors on each of their components to detect wear and tear , and backup systems to take over in the case of , say , a failure in the power electronics . <p> Vestas 's approach goes to the test this summer , as Denmark 's power supplier begins installing 80 Vestas machines in shallow water 14 to 20 kilometers off the Danish coastline . It will be the world 's biggest offshore wind thrm , powering as many as 150,000 Danish households . WIND SHADOWS <p> These upgrades will make big , heavy turbines more reliable , but they do n't add up to a fundamental shift in the economics of wind power . Nations like Denmark and Germany are prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much more costly in Europe , where higher taxes cover environmental and health costs associated with burning them . ( About 20 percent of Denmark 's power comes from wind . ) But for wind power to be truly cost competitive with fossil fuels in the United States , the technology must change . <p> What makes Wind Turbine 's Rocky Flats design such a departure is not only its hinged blades , but also their downwind orientation . The Danish design faces the blades into the wind and makes the blades heavy so they wo n't bend back and slam into the tower . The Wind Turbine design ca n't thee the wind-the hinged blades would hit the tower-so the rotor is positioned downwind . Finally , it uses two blades , rather than the three in the traditional design , to further reduce weight . <p> Advances in the computer modeling of such dangerous forces as vibration helped the design 's development . Flexible blades add an extra dimension to the machine 's motion ; so does the fact that the whole machine can freely swivel with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind , then locked in place . ) Predicting , detecting and preventing disasters-like rapidly shifting winds that swing a rotor upwind and send its flexible blades into the tower-are control challenges even with the best design . " If you do n't get that right , the machine can literally beat itself to death , " says Ken Deering , Wind Turbine 's vice president of engineering . <p> Two years ago , when Wind Turbine 's prototype was erected at Rocky Flats , there were worries that this machine , too , would beat itself to death . Thresher says some of his staff feared that the machine , like its 1980s predecessors , would not long escape the scrap heap . Today , despite some minor setbacks , those doubts are fading . <p> Emboldened by its early success , Wind Turbine has installed , near Lancaster , CA , a second prototype , with a larger , 48-meter blade span . By the end of this year , the company expects to boost blade length on this machine to 60 meters-full commercial size . What 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at reducing the noisy thump-known as a " wind shadow " - that can occur each time a blade whips through the area of turbulent air behind the tower . And with its lighter weight , the turbine could be mounted atop higher towers , reaching up to faster winds . BECALMED <p> Whatever the advances in technology , however , the wind power industry still faces significant hurdles , starting with uncertain political support in the United States . In Europe , wind power is already a relatively easy sell . But in the United States , wind developers rely on federal tax credits to make a profit . These vital credits face chronic opposition from powerful oil and coal lobbies and often lapse . The wind power industry raced to plug in its turbines before these credits expired at the end of last year , then went dormant for the three months it took the U.S. Congress to renew them . Congress extended the credits through the end of next year , initiating what is likely to be yet another start-and-stop development cycle . <p> A second obstacle to broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and widely accessible , but it is also frustratingly inconsistent . Just ask any sailor . And this fickleness translates into intermittent power production . The more turbines get built , the more their intermittency will complicate the planning and management of large flows of power across regional and national power grids . Indeed , in west Texas , a recent boom in wind turbine construction is straining the region 's transmission lines-and also producing power out of sync with local needs : wind blows during cool nights and stalls on hot days when people most need electricity . <p> Texas utilities are patching the problem by expanding transmission lines . But to really capture the value of wind power on a large scale , new approaches are needed to storing wind power when it 's produced and releasing it when needed . The Electric Power Research Institute , a utility-funded R &D; consortium in Palo Alto , CA , is conducting research on how to make better one-day-ahead wind predictions . More important , it is exploring ways to store energy when the wind is blowing . " We need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focusing on the wind turbines " says Chuck McGowin , manager for wind power technology at the institute . Storage facilities " would allow us to use what we have more efficiently , improve the value of it . " <p> In the northwest United States , one storage option being developed by the Portland , OR-based Bonneville Power Administration balances wind power with hydroelectric power . The idea is simple : when the wind is blowing , do n't let the water pass through the hydroelectric turbines ; on calm days , open up the gates . And the Tennessee Valley Authority is even experimenting with storing energy in giant fuel cells ; a pilot plant is under construction in Mississippi . <p> Wind power faces plenty of obstacles , but there 's more reason than ever to believe these obstacles will be overcome . Worries over the environmental effects of burning fossil fuels and political concerns about an overdependence on petroleum are spurring a boom in wind turbine construction . But it is advances in the technology itself , created by continued strong research efforts , that could provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> At Rocky Flats , four rows of research turbines-a total of a dozen machines ranging from 400-watt battery chargers to grid-ready 600-kilowatt machines-share a boulder-strewn 115-hectare plain . With the Rocky Mountains as a backdrop , their blades whup against the breezes blowing in from El Dorado Canyon to the west . At least , they do much of the time . " We have a lot of calm days , in the summer in particular , and for a testing site it 's good to have a mix , " Thresher says . <p> Calm days may be good for wind turbine research , but they 're still among the biggest concerns haunting wind turbine commercialization . While no technology can make the wind blow , lowercost , reliable technologies appear ready to take on its fickleness . And that could mean a wind turbine will soon sprout atop a breezy hill near you . <p> IN NORMAL CONDITIONS : Blades spin freely , the entire turbine swivels according to wind direction , and a gearbox amplifies blade rotation speed so a generator can produce power . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blades to flex up to 15 degrees downwind and five degrees upwind to shed excess wind force . Control systems include a brake to slow blade spin and a yaw drive to counteract swiveling .
