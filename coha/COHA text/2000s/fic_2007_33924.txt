Chapter One It was a beautiful hot July day in Marin County , just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco , as Tanya Harris bustled around her kitchen , organizing her life . Her style was one of supreme order . She loved having everything tidy , in its proper place , and in control . She loved to plan , and therefore she rarely ran out of anything , or forgot to do anything . She enjoyed a predictably efficient life . She was small , lithe , in good shape , and did n't look her age , which was forty-two years old . Her husband , Peter , was forty-six . He was a litigator with a respected San Francisco law firm , and did n't mind the commute to Ross , across the bridge . Ross was a prosperous , safe , highly desirable suburban community . They had moved there from the city sixteen years before because the school system was excellent . It was said to be the best in Marin . Tanya and Peter had three children . Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of August . He was going to UC Santa Barbara , and although he could n't wait to go , Tanya was going to miss him terribly . And they had twin daughters , Megan and Molly , who had just turned seventeen . Tanya had loved every moment of the last eighteen years , being a full-time mom to her kids . It suited her perfectly . She never found it burdensome or boring . The tedium of driving car pools had never seemed intolerable to her . Unlike mothers who complained of it , she loved being with her children , dropping them off , picking them up , taking them to Cub Scouts and Brownies , and she had been head of the parents ' association of their school for several years . She took pride in doing things for them , and loved going to Jason 's Little League and basketball games , and whatever the girls did as well . Jason had been varsity in high school , and was hoping to make either the basketball or tennis team at UCSB . His two younger sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were as different as night and day . Megan was small and blond like her mother . She had been an Olympic-caliber gymnast in her early teens , and only gave up national competitions when she found it was interfering with her work at school . Molly was tall , thin , and looked like Peter , with dark brown hair and endless legs . She was the only member of the family who had never played competitive sports . She was musical , artistic , loved taking photographs , and was a whimsical , independent soul . At seventeen , the twins were going into their senior year . Megan wanted to go to UC Berkeley like her mother , or maybe UCSB . Molly was thinking about going east , or to a college in California where she could follow artistic pursuits . She had been thinking seriously about USC in L.A. , if she stayed out west . Although the twins were very close , they were both adamant about not going to the same school . They had been in the same school and class all through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to go their own ways . Their parents thought it was a healthy attitude , and Peter was encouraging Molly to consider the Ivy League schools . Her grades were good enough , and he thought she 'd do well in a high-powered academic atmosphere . She was considering Brown , where she could design her own curriculum in photography , or maybe film school at USC . All three of the Harris children had done exceptionally well in school . Tanya was proud of her children , loved her husband , enjoyed her life , and had thrived in their twenty-year marriage . The years had flown by like minutes since she 'd married Peter as soon as she 'd graduated from college . He had just graduated from Stanford Law School , and joined the law firm where he still worked . And just about everything in their life had gone according to plan . There had been no major shocks or surprises , no disappointments in their marriage , no traumas with their kids as Jason , Megan , and Molly navigated through their teens . Tanya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of their children . They had no regrets , and were well aware of how fortunate they were . Tanya worked in a family homeless shelter in the city one day a week , and she took the girls with her whenever she could and their schedules allowed . They both had extracurricular pursuits , and did community service through school . Peter liked to tease Tanya about how boring they all were , and how predictable in their routines . Tanya took great pride in keeping it that way , for all of them . Everything about their life felt comfortable and safe . Her childhood had not been quite as neat and clean , which was why she liked keeping their life so tidy . Some might have called her life with Peter overly sterile and controlled , but Tanya loved it that way , and so did he . Peter 's own youth and adolescence had been very similar to the life he and Tanya had created for their children , a seemingly perfect world . In contrast , Tanya 's childhood had been difficult and lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alcoholic , and her parents had gotten divorced when she was three . She had only seen her father a few times after the divorce , and he died when she was fourteen . Her mother had worked hard as a paralegal to keep her in the best schools . She had died shortly after the twins were born , and Tanya had no siblings . An only child of only children , her family consisted of Peter , Jason , and the twins . They were the hub of her world . She cherished every moment that she spent with them . Even after twenty years of marriage , she could n't wait for Peter to come home at night . She loved telling him what she 'd done that day , sharing stories about the children , and hearing about his day . She still found his cases and courtroom experiences fascinating after twenty years , and she liked sharing her own work with him as well . He was always enthusiastic and encouraging about what she did . Tanya had been a freelance writer ever since she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their marriage . She loved doing it because it fulfilled her , added to their income , and she worked at home , without interfering with their children . She led something of a double life as a result . Devoted mother , wife , and caregiver by day , and singularly determined freelance writer at night . Tanya always said that to her , writing was as essential as the air she breathed . Freelance writing had proven to be the perfect occupation for her , and the articles and stories she 'd written had been well reviewed and warmly received over the years . Peter always said he was immensely proud of her , and appeared to be supportive of her work , although from time to time , he complained about her long work nights , and the late hours when she came to bed . But he appreciated the fact that it never interfered with her mothering or devotion to him . She was one of those rare , talented women who still put her family first , and always had . Tanya 's first book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's issues . It had been published by a small publisher in Marin in the late 1980s , and reviewed mostly by obscure feminist reviewers , who approved of her theories , topics , and ideas . Her book had n't been rabidly feminist , but was aware and independent , and the sort of thing one would expect a young woman to write . Her second book , published on her fortieth birthday , two years earlier , and eighteen years after her first book , had been an anthology of short stories , published by a major publisher , and had had an exceptionally good review in The New York Times Book Review . She had been thrilled . In between , she had been frequently published in literary magazines , and often in The New Yorker . She had published essays , articles , and short stories in a variety of magazines over the years . Her volume of work was consistent and prolific . When necessary , she slept little , and some nights not at all . Judging by the sales of her recent book of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average readers who enjoyed her work and among the literary elite . Several well-known and highly respected writers had written her letters of warm praise , and had commented favorably about her book in the press . As she was in all else , Tanya was meticulously conscientious about her work . She had managed to have a family , and still keep abreast of her work . For twenty years , she had set time aside every day to write . She was diligent and highly disciplined and the only time she took days off from her writing mornings was during school vacations , or when the children were home sick from school . In that case , they came first . Otherwise , nothing kept her from her work . In her hours away from Peter and the children , she was fanatical about her work . She let the phone go to voice mail , turned off her cell phone , and sat down to write every morning after her second cup of tea , once the kids had gone off to school . She also enjoyed writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of it for them , something Peter respected as well . She did occasional articles for the local Marin papers , now and then for the Chronicle , on an editorial basis . She liked writing funny pieces , and had a knack with comedic work , in a wry , witty tone , and now and then she wrote pure slapstick when describing the life of a housewife and mother , and scenes with her kids . Peter thought it was what she did best , and she enjoyed doing it . She liked writing funny stuff . The real money she 'd made , compared to what she made on her articles and essays , was writing occasional scripts for soap operas on national TV . She had done quite a number of them over the years . They were n't high literary endeavors , and she had no pretensions about what she did . But they paid extremely well , and the shows she wrote for liked her work , and called her often . It was n't work she was proud of , but she liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She usually wrote a dozen or so scripts a year . They had paid for her new Mercedes station wagon and a house they rented for a month at Lake Tahoe every year . Peter was always grateful for her help with tuition for their children . She had saved a nice little nest egg from her commercial writing work . She had cowritten a few miniseries , too , mostly before the market for miniseries and television movies had been impacted by reality TV . These days no one wanted miniseries or TV movies , and the only regular work she got for TV was on her soaps . Her agent called her about a script for a soap at least once a month , and sometimes more often . She knocked them out in a few days , working late at night while the rest of the family slept . Tanya was lucky that she needed very little sleep , much to her agent 's delight . She had never made gigantic money for her work , but she had produced steadily for many years . She was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a combination that worked well . Over the years Tanya 's freelance writing had been a steady , satisfying , and lucrative career , and as the kids got older , she had plans to write more . The only dream she had that had n't been fulfilled yet was to write the screenplay for a feature film . She had persisted in pushing her agent about it , but to some extent her work in TV made her ineligible . There was very little , if any , crossover between television and feature films . It irritated her because she knew she had the skills to do movies , but so far nothing in that vein had come her way , and she was no longer sure it ever would . It was an opportunity she 'd been waiting for , for twenty years . In the meantime , she was happy with the writing she did . And the system and schedule she juggled so successfully worked well for all of them . She 'd had a steady flow of work during her entire career . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she tended to her family with her right and met all their needs . Peter always said that she was an amazing woman , and a wonderful mother and wife . That meant far more to her than favorable literary reviews . Her family had been her first priority during all her years of marriage and motherhood . And as far as Tanya was concerned , she had done the right thing , even if it meant turning down an assignment now and then , although that was rare for her . Most of the time , she found a way to fit it in , and was proud of having done that for twenty years . She had never let Peter or her kids down , nor her work , or the people who paid her to do it . She had just sat down at her computer with a cup of tea , and was looking over the draft for a short story she 'd started the day before , when the phone rang , and she heard the answering machine pick it up . Jason had spent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , and Peter had long since left for work . He was preparing for a trial the following week . So she had a nice , peaceful morning to work , which was rare when the kids were out of school . She wrote far less in the summer than she did in the winter months . It was too distracting trying to write when the children were home on vacation , and around all the time . But she 'd had an idea for a new short story that had been bugging her for days . She was wrestling with it , when she heard her agent leave a message on the phone , and strode rapidly across the kitchen to pick it up . She knew that all the soaps she wrote for were on hiatus , so it was n't likely to be a request for a script for a soap . Maybe an article for a magazine , or a request from The New Yorker . She answered the phone just before her agent hung up . The message he 'd left was a request for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent in New York , who had represented her for the past fifteen years . The agency also had an office in Hollywood , where they generated a very respectable amount of work for her , as much as in New York , sometimes more . She loved all the different aspects of her work , and had been dogged and persistent about pursuing her career through all the kids ' years of growing up . They were proud of her , and once in a while watched her soaps , although they teased her a lot , and told her how " cheesy " they were . But they bragged about her to their friends . It was immensely important to her that Peter and her children respected what she did . And she liked knowing she did it well , without sacrificing her time with them . There was a sign on her office wall that said " What hath night to do with sleep ? " " I thought you might be writing , " her agent said as she picked up . His name was Walter Drucker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , hopping onto a high stool near the phone . The kitchen was the nerve center of the house , and she used it as an office . Her computer was set up in the corner , next to two file cabinets bulging with her work . " What 's up ? I 'm working on a new short story . I think it may turn out to be part of a trilogy when it grows up . " He admired her , and the fact that she was unfailingly professional and conscientious about everything she did . He knew how important her children were to her , but she still stayed on track with everything she wrote . She was very serious about her work , and everything she touched . It was a pleasure to deal with her . He never had to apologize for her missing a deadline , forgetting a story , going into rehab , or blowing a script . She was a writer to the core , and a good one . Tanya was a true professional . She had talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although usually he was n't a short-story fan , but hers were good . They always had an interesting twist , a surprise . There was something very quirky and unusual about her work . Just when the reader expected it least , she came up with a stunning twist , turn , or ending . And he liked her funny stuff best . Sometimes she made him laugh till he cried . " I 've got work , " he said , sounding vague and somewhat cryptic . She was still thinking about her story , and not entirely focused on what he 'd said . (
