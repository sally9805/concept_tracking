It seems hard to believe , but it was n't that long ago that the idea of birds evolving directly from dinosaurs seemed just a little flaky . Sure , they shared generally similar body plans  --  paleontologists have known that for more than a century  --  but that hardly constituted an airtight case . Over the past couple of decades , however , scientists have uncovered all sorts of detailed characteristics common to birds and dinosaurs : wishbones , swiveling wristbones and , most recently , proof that some dinosaurs sported feathers . There 's behavioral evidence too . Some dinosaurs made nests and sat on them , and one four-winged , feathered dino evidently glided like a flying squirrel . <P> A flurry of new finds offers even more evidence that the pigeon you see in the park had an ancestor that ruled the earth . Writing in Nature over the past two weeks , Chinese and American paleontologists announced the discovery of one dinosaur that evidently slept curled up in a posture identical to that of a sleeping duck and another that is the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyrannosaur is significant because that family of dinosaurs is believed to be among the closest relatives of modern birds . <P> Another team , meanwhile , recently published an analysis showing that Tyrannosaurus rex grew ( and thus metabolized ) at an impressively fast rate  --  suggesting that it might have been warm-blooded like birds . " There 's now so much material linking dinosaurs and birds that I ca n't imagine anybody being able to ignore it , " says paleontologist Luis Chiappe of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County . <P> Like many of the most dramatic dinosaur finds of the past few years , the new specimens were unearthed in a geological formation in northeastern China 's Liaoning province that has become one of the world 's most renowned fossil beds . Since the late 1990s , digs in Liaoning have produced an astonishing array of exquisitely preserved plants , insects , primitive mammals , birds and , most famously , feathered and winged dinosaurs . <P> Luckily for paleontologists , the beds are divided into different layers that yield different sorts of fossils . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark Norell of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City calls Liaoning 's " Pompeii layer , " a 10-ft. - thick stratum of ash and sand . It was deposited so quickly that , like the ash from the infamous eruption in Italy , it buried creatures alive wherever they were standing  --  or snoozing . This one was tiny : excluding its tail , it 's about the size of a Rock Cornish hen . That some of its bones have not completely fused indicates that this particular specimen was not quite fully grown . <P> In addition , it 's a new species , which Norell and co-discoverer Xing Xu of Beijing 's Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology named Mei long , from the Chinese for " soundly sleeping dragon . " But the specimen , dating to between 128 million and 139 million years ago , is clearly an early troodontid , an evolutionary cousin of tyrannosaurs.
