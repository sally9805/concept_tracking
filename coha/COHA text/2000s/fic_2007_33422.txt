Home Remedies By Pneuman , Angela Harvest Books Pneuman , Angela Home Remedies o o WHEN LENA GETS SICK , June , her mother , does n't notice for two days . It 's a Kentucky January , bleak and rainy with an occasional paltry snow , and Lena 's father , Patrick , from whom June has been divorced one year , has just announced his plans to remarry in March . Lena hears her mother talking to friends on the phone , her voice cheery and capable . " Oh , well , you know , it was bound to happen . We 're both moving on . Now , six months ago ? I would have been shaken to the core . " But off the phone , June shifts around the house , teary-eyed at irrelevant things she brings to Lena 's attention : a greeting-card commercial on television , the few dead leaves still stuck to the branches of the sycamore outside the kitchen window , a lumpy ceramic turtle Lena made for Patrick in kindergarten , four years ago . To cheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair turns frazzly , separating into kinky hunks with straight , brittle ends . " What do you think ? " June says , holding up the back of her hair with her hand , lowering her head for Lena to see . Lena squeezes a fistful , says it feels like the pink roof insulation in the attic . This sends June to her bedroom for an hour . At school Lena sits at her desk , listless and warm . The glands at the back of her throat swell to the size of peas , and when her teacher takes the classto the bathrooms , Lena pushes past the other girls to the mirrors over the sink , where under the fluorescent light she tries to see . She opens her mouth so wide that the corners crack into tiny grains of dry skin , but her throat lies in shadow . All day she probes the lumps with the back of her tongue , just to make sure they 're still sore . She likes how her voice has gone husky . At home June circles the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the calendar by the refrigerator . Since the announcement she 's been talking to the pastor each week again , as she did just after the divorce , and has taken to repeating for Lena phrases he gives her : " You must learn to love yourself , " and " All things work together for good . " " I want you to fully grasp that , " she tells Lena . It 's easy , she 's said on the phone , to talk to Lena as though the girl is much older . It could have something to do with how Lena 's eyes shrink behind thick glasses , how in sickness her skin has taken on a yellowish tint . " Do you love yourself , Lena ? " June asks , bringing her face so close that Lena can see every hair , every pore . This close , faces look like something else entirely , the nubbly surface of the planets Lena 's seen on science shows . " I guess , " says Lena . She 's never thought about feeling anything at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but June seems to think it 's important , which means it might be or it might not be . The problem with June , Lena once heard Patrick say , is that everything turns into a big production . A weepy federal case . " What 's that you 're doing with your mouth ? " June says . Lena has been feeling her glands , and she bites her tongue to keep it still . On her hot forehead , June 's palm is clammy . " You 're burning up , Lena . You 're hot as can be . Have you been feeling bad ? " " I can feel my throat , " Lena says . " You 're sick , " June says . " Lena , you 're sick . I did n't notice and you did n't say . Why did n't you say ? You have to say , Lena . " June 's fingers disappear into her stiff hair . She closes her eyes and says , " I feel like a horrible mother . " IT TURNS OUT TO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor gives Lena some medicine , and after four days and a weekend Lena returns to school . But three weeks later , she 's sick again . This happens sometimes , the doctor says . If the antibiotic does n't kill all the bacteria , they come back with renewed force . Lena pictures it like tug-of-war in gym . All the bacteria on one team , lunging hard to make their comeback . June is in a pinch . She processes payments at the electric company and has run out of days she can take off . The woman who used to sit for Lena during the day now has two toddlers of her own , and wo n't expose them to strep . All the mothers of Lena 's friends work , the teenaged girls are in school , and Patrick lives half a day away , over the border into Tennessee . So the pastor makes an announcement at church about a member needing a sitter , and the following Monday morning Mrs. Shefferd arrives . She is a small , bony woman , with short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leopard-print coat from Sears , some thirty years old . Because it does n't button all the way , Mrs. Shefferd wears a jacket underneath , and several sweaters underneath the jacket . " Lena , back to bed , " June says . She clips earrings onto her earlobes and buttons her own coat . " Mrs. Shefferd , I 've left directions on the counter . " " Go on , now , " says Mrs. Shefferd , her voice throaty and sure . " You do n't worry about a thing . " Each morning when Lena wakes up , Mrs. Shefferd greets her with a glass of water . The directions say for Lena to drink a glass of water each hour , even though after the fourth glass , fourth hour , she can hear her stomach sloshing and has to pee every ten minutes . The directions also say when the antibiotic is to be taken and what Lena is to have for lunch each day . The notes make it clear Lena should stay in bed , but Mrs. Shefferd allows her to lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Shefferd rocks purposefully in June 's antique rocking chair , the one Lena 's supposed to be careful of . During commercials she asks Lena questions . Not the questions Lena has come to expect from old ladies -- nothing about school , or church , or her parents . Instead , Mrs. Shefferd offers choices . " Where would you rather live , " she asks , " the beach or the mountains ? " Lena says " beach " and Mrs. Shefferd reminds her of hurricanes and tidal waves . Lena says " mountains " and Mrs. Shefferd reminds her , cheerfully , that some mountains are volcanoes . " If you could only eat foods that begin with ' r ' or ' c , ' Mrs. Shefferd says , " which would you pick ? " " R , " Lena says . " No celery ? No Cream of Wheat ? " " I like roast beef , " Lena says . " Oh , yes , and rhubarb and rutabaga , " says Mrs. Shefferd . " Good thinking . " When Lena feels like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of her closet -- crocheting that her grandmother tried to teach her on the last visit , a half-finished floral paint-by-number , the oils gone slick and runny inside their tiny plastic vials . Mrs. Shefferd comments politely on the painting and fingers the crocheting -- just a granny square in tricolor pink yarn that Lena can'teven remember how she made . " I do n't know how to crochet , " Mrs. Shefferd says . She holds the square to the lamp , then rubs it against her face , eyes closed . " My mother was a different breed . " Lena , kneeling at her feet , can smell cinnamon on Mrs. Shefferd 's breath . On the television people exclaim and jump around , having won a prize for guessing something , but Lena has turned down the sound . Lena brings out her shoebox of teeth from her father 's office of orthodontics . They are n't real , are really just the molds he makes of patients ' teeth , to display on before-and-after shelves in the waiting room and to take to conferences . These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room floor for Mrs. Shefferd to admire , which she does ; so many sets of jaws , incisors twisted in their sockets , or pushed into unnatural rows , and plaster gums that just end , the irregular shapes of upper mouths . There are also strips of wax in little boxes , miniature rubber bands of all colors that Lena and Mrs. Shefferd string on yarn for necklaces , and a black mouthpiece Lena 's father uses to wedge open his patients ' mouths , and to pin down their tongues . It 's a durable plastic , so that if the hand of his assistant slips , or even his own -- though this has never happened -- and nicks a tongue or shut on anyone 's fingers . or transmitted in any form or by any means , electronic or mechanical , including photocopy , recording , or any information storage and retrieval system , without permission in writing from the publisher
