Chapter One They sat together at their favorite corner table , two of them alone , absorbed in the candlelight and in each other . He toyed with the dinner knife that lay beside his hand , his eyebrows raised , gazing at her face . She leaned toward him and smiled , her elbow on the table , her chin propped inside the chalice of her palm . Her dainty gold bracelet caught high on her wrist and dangled there . " I do n't know why they wo n't let Braden pitch , " she said . " All he needs is a little confidence . If the coach would just be willing to work with him a little more . " David laughed . " What ? Why are you laughing at me ? " " Abby . Braden can hit , but he 's probably never going to be a pitcher . He throws about as straight as a jackrabbit runs . " " He could do it . " David Treasure reached across the table and laid his fingers across his wife 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I thought we agreed that tonight we would n't talk about kids . " " I ca n't help it , David . I 'm his mother . What do you think ? I see everything he ought to be able to do , and I do n't know why he 's not doing it . " " I think you 're beautiful when you 're all wrapped up in being a mother . That 's what I think . " She laughed at him then , and felt her earrings dancing like two tiny birdcages against her earlobes . She sighed and shook her arm and her bracelet toppled from her wrist to her forearm . " Okay . You 're right . We did promise each other , did n't we ? " " Yes . " " So we 'll talk about something else . Anything else . " She paused . " Something . " She cast about to change the subject . " How about my new little black dress ? " " I like your new little black dress just fine . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " I 'd like you even better- " " David ! " He grinned at her , the expression in his eyes as unguarded and as open as a schoolboy 's . " You wanted to know what I was thinking , did n't you ? " " Okay . You 're right . I left myself open for that one . " " You did . " He grinned and lifted his water glass , holding it high so the ice glistened in the candlelight . " Happy Anniversary . Just think what we were doing twelve years ago right now . " " Twelve years , " Abigail said . " It does n't seem possible . We were probably walking down the aisle right about now . " " Well , no . " He checked his watch . " It 's three hours past that . I was thinking what happens after the wedding . " " David ! " He crossed his arms and laughed and leaned back in his chair , his blue eyes mischievous . " Well , you said you wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romance . That 's ... that 's ... " " I 'm a man , Abby . That 's romance . " " Do n't lean so far back in your chair . You 'll fall over and the waiter will have to pick you up . " He raised his eyebrows and righted his chair . " To twelve years as Mrs. David Treasure , " she said , lifting her glass . " Hear . Hear . " David raised his goblet , too , clicked it against hers , and set it down . He squared his shoulders and eyed her for a long moment , the sudden stretch of silence an uncommon thing between them . " You 're the best thing that has ever happened to me , " he said , reaching across the table and , in a sure sign of possession , gripping both of her wrists . " I want you to know that . " After all these years , the shape of his hands could still stir her . His broad fingers . His powerful , square knuckles . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cuff of his shirtsleeve and the band of his watch . She raised her eyes to his , touched her stomach where the warmth began ... and blushed . He grinned and leaned back in his chair . Anyone watching could see by the relaxed way they chatted , by the way their laughter came in short , sharp bursts , that this was n't the celebration of new romance . They celebrated an old , strong love . Conviction and commitment had been tempered by the test of time . The waiter brought around a cake with " Happy Anniversary " scripted in pink-sugar icing . When Abigail cut David a piece and licked the knife , he inclined across the table and kissed her . " No fair . You always figure out ways to get more icing . " Only a few people recognized them as they rose to leave the restaurant ; it was summertime and they 'd reserved a late table at the Rendezvous Bistro to avoid the tourist crowd . But the friends who did see them here in the newest , classiest eatery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from across the room . " Heard about your anniversary on KSGT this morning . That radio morning calendar keeps me up to date on everybody in town . " " Hey , Treasures . Congratulations , you two . " " Heard Braden 's pitching 's getting better this summer . Great kid you 've got there . " " Thank you . " " Hello . " " Good to see you , " Abigail and David repeated half a dozen times on their way out the door . David hurried down the front walk of the restaurant to bring around their Suburban while Abigail carried the white box with extra cake . " Are you tired ? " Abigail asked when he yawned on the drive . " Yeah . Boring , huh ? I 'm an old married man these days , anxious to get home . " " Just as long as you 're going to the same home I 'm going to , we do n't have anything to worry about . " When they parked in front of their own house twenty minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Abigail grabbed her purse from where it lay beside her on the seat . " I do n't know why she ca n't turn some of the lights off after she gets him into bed . " " She 's young . Probably still afraid of the dark herself . " But everything seemed fine when the babysitter let them inside the front foyer . Brewster , their black Labrador , met them with delirious happiness in the hall . " Everything all right ? " Abigail surveyed the living room , making sure all was right in the Treasure territory . " No problems or anything ? " The teenaged sitter examined the scuffed toes of her clogs as if trying to decide whether or not to tell them the whole story . " Not any problems , really . Except Braden would n't go to sleep when I told him to and he kept jumping on the bed . He said he was practicing pitching wind-ups . " " I 'll have a talk with that young man tomorrow . " " He threw the ball sideways and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It crunched a big hole in the lampshade . I 'm really sorry . " David draped his arm around Abigail 's shoulders . " To think that only an hour ago his mother was saying she wanted him to get more practice . " The babysitter picked up her backpack before she turned back to tell them something else . " Oh , and some lady called and left a message on the machine . I did n't answer it . I just listened to make sure it was n't you needing anything . " David handed her a twenty and a five-hefty pay for four hours of babysitting these days , but Abigail had encouraged it coming home in the car . Crystal was good and they both wanted to keep her . " You ready to ? I 'll take you home . " " Sure . Thanks . " Abigail waved them off and smiled to herself as she locked the door behind them . Well . Well . David had certainly been in a hurry to get rid of the babysitter . She padded into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ankles with her opposite feet , kicked her shoes halfway across the room , and wiggled her toes in the carpet . She assessed herself in the mirror for a moment before she peeled the spaghetti straps from her shoulders and laid the new dress over a chair . Once she 'd slipped into her fancy nightgown and robe , she prowled , telling herself she ought to wander through the kitchen to turn lights off . Which of course was only an excuse to snitch another bite of cake . In the kitchen , she licked icing off her fingers and stared at the blinking light on the phone machine . Hm-mmm . She should listen . She ought to check and see who 'd called . But just then she heard the door , the click of her husband 's key in the lock . He 'd scarcely made it inside before he drew Abigail against him and kissed her . " Let 's check on Braden , " she whispered against his chin . Before she gave herself to her husband , she wanted to make certain all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . She took his hand , leading him up the hallway to their son 's room with its fancy lodge-pole pine bed , Ralph Lauren curtains , and Elks baseball cap dangling from the chair . David crossed his arms over his chest and there they stood in the doorway , mother and father shoulder to shoulder , looking at the little blond head on the pillow . Each of them was thinking how this time together had been good for them . Sometimes being busy with children and jobs and everyday life could make a husband and wife forget how to complete a sentence when they were alone . Every time they went out they had the chance to start over . Braden had fallen asleep with his head cradled in his baseball glove . David released Abigail 's hand long enough to slip into the semidarkness and wriggle the battered leather from beneath his son 's cheek . " Hey , sport . " The movement roused Braden , who rolled over and squinted his eyes open . " Dad . " Nothing more . Just the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two arms shot out of the blankets and tangled around David 's neck , pulling him low against the pillow as Abigail watched with a weight of gratitude growing heavy in her chest . Her two boys , David and Braden . They meant the world to each other ... and to her . Lord , when I trust you , I can trust everything around me . You 've given me everything I ever wanted , right here . David readjusted the blankets beneath his son 's chin and kissed Braden on the forehead . " Love you , Brade . " " Crystal would n't let me practice my pitches , " Braden mumbled , still half asleep . " She told us . We 're going to have to work out something about your lamp , you know . You 'll have to do a few chores and earn money . " " Did you have fun ? " " Yes . It was very romantic . Your mother wore a new dress and made me feel special . " " G'night , Dad . " " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping us secure . Braden burrowed his face deep into his pillow and his baseball mitt again , his eyelids closed . Abigail said in a hushed tone , " Ah , he 's fine , is n't he ? " She leaned her head against her husband 's shoulder . " I just wanted to make sure . Do you have any idea how much I love seeing you two together ? " " Well , Mrs. Treasure . You 've seen everything you need to see , have n't you ? " He cupped his fingers around wisps of her hair . " Maybe we ought to finish what we 've started . " " Maybe , " she echoed , and this time she could n't help smiling as David took her by the hand and led her where he wanted . As they passed through the kitchen , though , the blinking light on their answering machine distracted him . He stopped for a moment and stared at it . " That can wait , ca n't it ? With all the things that go on around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning ? " " Exactly what I was thinking . " " A girl after my own heart . " " I am after your heart . And I think I know just how to get it . " " Hm-m-mm . " Abigail followed her husband into the bedroom that they 'd shared since exchanging wedding vows a dozen years ago tonight . Through the open window she could hear the coyotes yipping and the lilting music of Fish Creek and the hiss of night breeze like rain , moving through pine boughs and cottonwood leaves . " Love you . " Abigail nuzzled the words against his ear . " Nothing will ever change that , David . Ever . " " You mean that ? " " Yeah . " " You promise ? " " I do promise . That 's an easy promise to make . " " You sure ? " " I am sure , " she answered without hesitating , her voice reflecting all the fervency of her faith in her God and in her husband . But in the next room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it flickered red against the microwave , the dishwasher door , the chrome faucet , against every shiny surface in the kitchen . Blink . Blink . Pause . Blink . Blink . Pause . All through the night . ( Continues ... )
