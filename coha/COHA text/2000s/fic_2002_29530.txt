MY USED-BOOK STORE had been open for just about a month when the police showed up . I had n't called them , of course ; a black man has to think twice before calling the cops in Watts . They came to see me late that afternoon . Two well-built young men . One had dark hair and the other sported freckles . The dark one wandered around the room , flipping through random books , looking , it seemed , for some kind of contraband . " Where 'd you get all these books , son ? " the other cop asked , looking down on me . I was sitting in my favorite swivel chair behind the makeshift table-desk that I used for book sales and purchases . " Libraries , " I replied . " Stole ' em ? " the dark-haired cop asked from across the room . There was an eager grin on his face . " Front'a each page marked discarded , " I said , editing out all unnecessary words as I spoke . " Library throws away thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folder at the far end of the table , and the cop standing over me let his right hand drift toward his holster . I removed a sheet of paper and handed it over slowly . " This letter , " I said , " is from the office of the head librarian downtown . " The freckled and frowning cop used his left hand to take the letter from me . I was put out by the roust but not surprised . The police were n't used to a Negro in Watts going into business for himself . Most black migrants from the South usually got jobs for the city or did domestic work or day labor . There were very few entrepreneurs active among us at that time . That 's why I had asked Miss Ryan , assistant to the president of the county library system , for a letter of explanation . She had written the letter on official letterhead , addressed " To whom it may concern , " stating that any library book marked discarded was no longer the property of the library and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw fit . Upon reading this the officer 's hand moved away from his gun . " The law says that you 're supposed to post business hours clearly on the front door , " he said , letting the letter fall back on the table . There was no such ordinance , and I knew it , but I said , " Yes , officer . I 'll take care of it tomorrow . " I felt no rancor toward them . Being challenged by the law was a rite of passage for any Negro who wanted to better himself or his situation . I HAD OPENED my nameless bookstore on Central just down from 101st Street . It was the only one of its kind for miles . I carried everything from Tolstoy to Batman , from Richard Wright to Popular Mechanics . No new books , but a used book is just as good as a new one as far as the reading goes . At first I was scandalized by the thought that a library would discard a book , but once I realized the possibilities for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.A. , carting off almost two thousand volumes in just over three months . Then I paid first and last month 's rent on a storefront that was down the street from a Holy Roller church called Messenger of the Divine . My friend Fearless Jones helped me throw together some pine shelving and I was in business . I bought magazines two for a nickel and sold them at twice the price . I traded one book or magazine for two of equal worth . Business was n't brisk , but it paid the rent and utilities . And all day long I could do the thing I loved best-reading . I read Up from Slavery , Tom Sawyer Abroad , Journey to the Center of the Earth , Mein Kampf , and dozens of other titles in the first few months . Whole days I spent in my reclining swivel chair , turning pages and drinking Royal Crown colas . Every once in a while I 'd have to stop in order to sell an encyclopedia to proud parents or a romance to a woman who needed more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's work . I had a whole army of little children helpers who 'd sort and alphabetize for comic book privileges and maybe a free taco now and then . For a solid three months I was the happiest man in L.A. , in spite of the cops . I had a checking account , and for the first time in my life I was caught up on my bills . But then Love walked in the door . It was a cloudless day in October , the year was 1954 . It was n't hot or cold outside , but her dress was definitely a summer frock , white with a floral pattern . The thin straps lay loose on her brown shoulders . She did n't seem to be wearing anything under that dress-not that she needed to . The sunglasses had been pushed up to the top of her head , nestled in the big , floppy curls she 'd had done at some beauty shop . Her face is what scared me . It was too wide to be pretty and too flat to be handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel my cheek rubbing up against hers . The last time I 'd felt like that about a woman I almost got killed . So the fast beating of my heart was a coin toss between love and fear . " Is Reverend Grove here ? ' " she asked me in a breathy voice . " Who ? " " Reverend William Grove . He preached with Father Vincent and Sister Thalia . " The skirt came down to the middle of her knees . Her legs were bare and her ankles were bound with thin straps of white leather snaking up from delicate sandals . " I do n't know any Grove , " I said , forcing my eyes back to her face . The name had some meaning to me , but it felt so distant that I thought it must be someone from long ago , maybe from down in Louisiana . Certainly not anyone this beautiful girl and I would both know . She looked around the room , twisting at the waist to see for herself . She had a figure made for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtain that hung over a doorway . " Where 's that go ? " she asked . " My back room , " I said . Then it came to me . " You must be talking about the Messenger of the Divine . " " Oh yes . Yes . " The hope in her voice brought me up out of my chair . She moved toward me . Her hands reached out for me . " They had a place look like mine down the street , " I said . " But they moved out . Must be two months ago now . " " What ? " Her face went blank . " Moved , " I said . " Went away . " " Where ? " " I do n't know . They moved out in the middle of the night . Took everything . All that was left was an empty space and a few paper fans . " I was sad to make my little report because now there was no reason for her to stay and twist around . I realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in books . I had the notion that I should go out to the Parisian Room that night . Just then the young woman leaned backward and then crumpled forward , into my arms . As I stood there holding her steady , the fear fled my heart . At close quarters her scent was floral , but it was also sharp , like the smell after lightning strikes . " You got some water in the back ? " she whispered . I nodded and led her through the heavy burlap curtain to the back room and put her on my cot . She was mumbling and crying . " Are you okay ? " I asked , perching next to her . " Where did they go ? " I could n't find the words to hurt her again . " What am I gon na do ? " she cried , turning her head , looking around in the dark as if the room might somehow transform itself into the church she sought . " Reverend Grove is the only one who can help me now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking , even then , that I did n't really want to know . " I have to find William . If I don't- " She broke off in tears . I tried to console her but she was bereft . After a moment or two I heard the front door to the store come open . She heard it too and took in a quick breath . Her fear made me wary again . I rose up and went through the curtain to the store . The man standing there was a study in blunt . His hairless head was big and meaty . The dark features might not have been naturally ugly , but they had been battered by a lifetime of hard knocks : broken nose , a rash that had raged and then scarred over the lower left side of his face . His eyebrows seemed to be different sizes , but that might just have been the product of a permanent scowl . " Wherethegurl ? " he said in a tone so guttural that for a moment I could n't make out the words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I 'm only five eight ) , but he had the chest and shoulders of someone who should have been much taller . He was a volcano crushed down into just about man size . His clothes were festive , a red Hawaiian shirt and light blue pants . The outfit was ridiculous , like a calico bow on an English bulldog . " I don't- " I said . " Wherethegurl , muthahfuckah ! " He had the build of a fire-plug but moved like a cat . He had me by the arm and in the air before I could invent a lie . " Where is she ? " He looked around the room and saw that the burlap curtain was the only exit besides the front door . He threw me at the curtain , and I tore it down falling into the back room . He came in right behind me , looking at all the corners and then at the bed . My eyes were on him . " This your last chance , " he said , threat heavy in each word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was empty . " I do n't know , man , " I said as bravely as I could . " She come an ' asked about a church used to be around here . I told her that they were gone . So then she said she had to go to the bathroom . " I gestured with my hand . He saw the door and flung it open with so much force that one of the hinges ripped loose from the wall . All that was revealed was a lidless commode and tin sink . " Where is she ? " He dragged me to my feet with one hand . " She must'a gone out the back , man . I do n't know . " I think he slapped me , but I 've been hit by blackjacks that had more give than his fingers . The taste of salt came into my mouth and the lightbulb on the desk multiplied into a thousand stars . " Wherethegurl ? " a parrot somewhere said . " She must'a gone out the back , " I repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie . " He slapped me again and I tried to think of what I could say to save my life . But I did n't know anything , not even the frightened woman 's name . I decided that , since he was going to kill me anyway , I would go out bravely . For once I would be as brave as my friend Fearless . I had never stood up to a bully in my life . So at least this one last time , in a back room in Watts , Paris Minton would show some backbone . Fuck you , asshole , was on the tip of my tongue . " Please do n't , brother . " My trembling words betrayed me . " I do n't know nuthin ' . " He slapped me again . My head turned around so far that I was sure my neck had broken . " You a dead man , " my attacker said . A child 's voice squeaked , " Mr. Minton , you okay ? " " Who 's that man ? " another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I hit that my killer wore leather sandals on bare feet . As I lost consciousness I thought that if a man was going to kill me , he should at least wear grown-up men 's shoes .
