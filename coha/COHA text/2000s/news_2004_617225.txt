<p> On Friday , it will be March 19  --  exactly one year since the United States went to war in Iraq . Many things in Iraq have changed since then . <p> So what 's it like to be a student in Iraq 's capital , Baghdad ? <p> News for Kids asked a reporter in Iraq to find out . So he recently visited a middle school for boys and a middle school for girls . <p> The students told him that things are better at school , but not everything is great . <p> Today , News for Kids gives you an idea of what your life might be like if you were a student in Baghdad . <p> Baghdad , Iraq  --  In a class at Amjad Middle School , the teacher asks how the ancient Phoenicians earned their living . The students , all girls , jump up with answers . <p> They raise their hands , stand , lean forward and say , " Sitt ! Sitt ! " That 's an Arabic word that 's similar to " Ma'am . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " they say , and " traders . " <p> The teacher tells them , " Mumtaz , " which means " excellent . " <p> Learning about the Phoenicians in Iraq is like studying the Pilgrims in the United States . But the Phoenicians were around thousands of years earlier . <p> Like American middle school students , Iraqis in middle school take history , science , mathematics and gym . They study even English . <p> But their schools are missing a few things normally found in U.S. schools . Like what ? Computers , photocopiers , telephones and , usually , electricity . <p> A SHORTAGE OF ALMOST EVERYTHING <p> Schools in Iraq have been neglected for a long time . Saddam Hussein , the former dictator who for many years ruled the country with an iron hand , did n't spend much money on schools . <p> Last year , after American soldiers took over Baghdad and threw Saddam out , there was chaos and people stole furniture , desks and lights . <p> Work to get the schools fixed has gone slowly . But at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat of paint . And students now carry blue book bags donated by the U.S. government . <p> But it 's been mostly the students and teachers themselves who have brought their schools back to life . <p> In a district of Baghdad called " 9 Nissan , " there are two middle schools near each other that are like many others . These schools were not looted , but they still do n't have much . There are barely enough desks for the children , and there are few school supplies . <p> THE BIRTHPLACE OF ALGEBRA <p> Mathematics is popular with many Iraqi students . Why ? Some say it helps them keep track of money . <p> They learn algebra in middle school , just like kids in America do . <p> But algebra has a special place in Iraq . Iraq is where algebra is believed to have started , way back in the eighth century . It was called " al-jabr . " That eventually became our word " algebra . " <p> WORRY ABOUT GETTING KIDNAPPED <p> Iraqi students now worry about security , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls and boys getting kidnapped since Saddam Hussein 's government was toppled by American forces last April . <p> A guard with an automatic rifle keeps watch outside Amjad Middle School for girls . <p> At Na'oman Ibn al-Munther Middle School for boys , Principal Ibrahim Mohsen al-Musawi , 46 , has found old military shells outside . <p> SADDAM THROWN OUT OF TEXTBOOKS <p> Chalkboards and books are used in Iraqi schools . The books are similar to the ones used before the war last year . But there 's one big difference . The parts about Saddam Hussein , the tyrant who ruled Iraq before the United States threw him out , and his Baath Party have been removed . <p> When Saddam was in power , men from his Baath Party would come to schools and collect money . Sometimes they also made the students say slogans about the glory of Saddam . All of that has ended now . <p> STUDYING RELIGION IN SCHOOL <p> Iraqi middle school students take classes where they study Islam , the main religion . A few students , however , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes . <p> SOME GIRLS NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE PE <p> Both the boys ' and the girls ' schools are crowded compared with American schools . Classes at Amjad Middle School usually have about 34 girls in them . Na'oman Ibn al-Munther Middle School has as many as 50 boys in some classes . <p> Physical education classes at Amjad are smaller , because some parents do n't want their girls running around outside . The girls who do take PE class wear long pants and long sleeves . In Iraq , girls and women are expected to be modest . <p> Their teacher , Khansa'a Bahjat al-Khafaji , who is 31 , says the school has no gym equipment . But that does n't stop her . She keeps the girls busy with a full workout of running and exercises . <p> " Relax ! Sit down ! Do n't be afraid ! " she tells them . " Take a breath ! " <p> A PAY RAISE FOR TEACHERS <p> Iraqi teachers got a big pay raise after the U.S. invasion of Iraq . Before the war last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars a month . Now they make more than $150 a month . <p> Before , teachers often earned extra money by giving private lessons . Now it is easier to stop teachers from charging for private tutoring . In the past , some teachers would make their students pay a tutoring fee in order to get a passing grade . <p> KEEPING BOYS AND GIRLS APART <p> Boys and girls in Iraq can go to the same elementary schools . But starting in middle school , they must go to separate schools . <p> Amjad Middle School in Baghdad is for girls . Na'oman Ibn al-Munther Middle School , which is nearby , is for boys . ( " Amjad " means " glory , " and Na'oman Ibn al-Munther was a historic Arab hero . ) <p> Why are the schools separate ? <p> Most people in Iraq are Muslims . In their culture , boys and girls of middle school and high school age are not allowed to mix or start going on dates as young as they do in America and Europe . <p> Many Iraqi parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools . But others would never send their daughters to a mixed school , because they believe girls should not be in the company of boys . <p> Some think more studying gets done without girls and boys distracting each other . <p> LEAVING SCHOOL TO GET MARRIED OR GO TO WORK <p> The girls at Amjad Middle School are 12 to 16 years old . Some do n't finish school because their parents pull them out when they find husbands for them . <p> Some of the boys at Na'oman Ibn al-Munther Middle School sometimes miss class because they must work . <p> " My father is not working , and I want to help my family , " says Ahmed Aziz al-Zarkani , 14 . He is only in the first level of middle school , equal to seventh grade , because working has made him miss a lot of classes . <p> Ahmed 's father is disabled . After school , Ahmed works in a tire shop , where he earns about 75 cents a day . <p> Some students are luckier . They have more time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high school and college . <p> " I want to learn English , " said Ali Fadel , 13 . " This is the future now . " <p> KEEPING AN EYE ON OTHER KIDS <p> Each class has a student " controller , " chosen by the teacher . You 'd better behave in front of this student , who reports trouble and helps keep track of attendance . <p> Seba Mohammed al-Mousawi , 13 , is one such student . But that 's not all she does . She helps teach other students , too . <p> Last year , Seba says , one of her jobs as a controller was to collect money from students to give to Saddam Hussein 's Baath Party . She 's glad she no longer has to do that . <p> Seba wants to be an architect . Iraq is known for its good architects .
