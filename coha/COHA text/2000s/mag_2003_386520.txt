A creative approach to funding that puts students in both the corporate office and the classroom has sparked a renewal in Catholic education . <p> Urban Catholic high schools have had a tough go over the last few decades . Nationwide , their number has dropped from almost 1,100 in 1970 to just over 600 today , according to the National Catholic Education Association . <p> The financial strains that lead to high school closings and consolidations come from all directions : older buildings that cost more to maintain ; fewer students bringing in less tuition money ; the fact that more than 85 percent of faculty and staff today are lay women and men who need larger paychecks to make ends meet than the sisters , brothers , and priests who preceded them . <p> So John Huelskamp , principal of the two-year-old , 192-student De La Salle North Catholic High School in Portland , Oregon can be excused if he sounds a little proud and a bit more than incredulous at what they 've managed to accomplish in North Portland . " Growth like this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these areas . You 're not supposed to be opening them . " <p> De La Salle North Catholic is part of the Cristo Rey Network , a growing coalition of small high schools that aim to provide a Catholic , college-prep education to students who would otherwise miss the opportunity . The stroke of genius that allows these schools to function is a corporate work-study program in which all students work one day a week at an entry-level professional job . The money they earn goes directly back to the school , keeping tuition low and the school in reach of economically disadvantaged families . In Portland , that means families pay $2,100 a year while students contribute $4,375 through their work . <p> Five schools are currently operating : The first , Cristo Rey Jesuit High School , opened in Chicago in 1996 ; De La Salle North Catholic opened in 2001 . Last year Juan Diego Catholic High School opened in Austin , Texas and Verbum Dei High School in Los Angeles switched from a traditional tuition-based school to the corporate work-study program . Arrupe Jesuit High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next year , thanks to an $18.9 million gift from the Bill &; Melinda Gates Foundation and the Cassin Educational Initiative Foundation , six more schools are set to open in Tucson , Arizona ; Cambridge and Lawrence , Massachusetts ; Waukegan , Illinois ; Cleveland , Ohio ; and New York City . Keys to success <p> Cristo Rey ( " Christ the King " in Spanish ) opened seven years ago in Pilsen/Little Village , the heart of Chicago 's Latino community . The 450-student school that bills itself as " the school that works " has convinced everyone from students and their parents to corporation presidents and office managers that this innovative model is the way to go . <p> " They do n't call in sick . They 're never late . They 're quick . They do n't screw around . There are days when it 's much easier to deal with them than some of the other people in the office , " says Mary Dwyer , an executive assistant at LaSalle Bank in Chicago who has worked with Cristo Rey students for six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the John Buck Company , a commercial real estate office , says her job " helps me out for the future , for college . I have a better understanding now of what I want to do . " <p> The school draws mainly from nearby public schools and looks for kids who may be up to two grade levels behind , but who are motivated and capable of handling college prep classes and a professional work environment . The application process includes an essay , two letters of recommendation , and an interview . Last year just 57 percent of applicants were accepted . <p> The academics and community spirit at Cristo Rey are also key ingredients to the school 's distinctiveness . " Most schools claim that students are the priority . Here that claim is lived , " says Jesus Marquez , a 16-year-old junior who spends his Tuesdays working at a law firm . " Since the school is small , you get to know the teachers more ; they get to focus on your needs . " <p> And Marquez says his mom and dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school 's corporate internship program : " They love it . From their view , I 'm learning what it takes to earn a dollar instead of just to spend it . " <p> That lesson also appeals to businesses that hire students , says Jeff Thielman , president of the Cristo Rey Network . " A lot of people in the business community remember when they were young , and they admire that these kids are working . " <p> " It was scary at first , " says Araceli Heredia , a junior who works at a hotel representation company . Heredia still does n't like dodging the traffic and crowds of Chicago 's Loop , but her coworkers make up for it : " They 're really friendly . I get a chance to learn new things and become familiar with what they do . " Going national <p> As Cristo Rey honed its program , many looked at the school with hopes of replicating it in other cities , but no one managed to secure the initial funds to start a school . Cristo Rey administrators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to build a library and gym . But when Cassin saw what was going on at the school , he plunked down $22 million instead to help take the model nationwide . A network office opened in 2001 to oversee the creation of new schools , and the energy spread fast . <p> Right away , groups in Portland , Cleveland , and Austin signed up to do feasibility studies . Recent inquiries have come from Indianapolis , Washington , D.C. , and Albuquerque , New Mexico . A proposed school needs to meet nine " mission effectiveness standards " developed by the network , and if it 's deemed feasible , the network awards Gates and Cassin money for the startup . <p> The network continues to get three or four serious inquiries a month , Theilman says , because this type of school is a real hope for otherwise underserved communities . Rich Clark , president of St. Martin de Porres High School , slated to open on Cleveland 's East Side next fall , estimates that 14,000 kids between the ages of 5 and 18 live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ median family income in the neighborhood is $16,000 . <p> " Colleges are thirsty for kids like this , " says Clark . Currently Cristo Rey is the only school with graduates who completed all four years of high school under the corporate work-study program , but Clark 's point bears out : All 70 members of Cristo Rey 's class of 2003 were accepted to at least one college , and the class was awarded more than $1 million in financial aid . Schools they chose include Brown University , St. Louis University , and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . <p> Maria Tirado is a freshman at Monmouth College , a small liberal arts college three and a half hours from Chicago . She was Cristo Rey 's valedictorian last June and is the first member of her family to go to college . Tirado is studying accounting and Spanish . She 's also gotten involved with the university 's Christian fellowship and the coalition for ethnic awareness in her first semester . <p> " My whole high school career prepared me for this , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family moved from Mexico to Chicago when she was in the seventh grade . She picked her high school not because of its internship program or its Catholic foundation , but because of something far more basic : " Cristo Rey was just a name in Spanish , " she says with a laugh . <p> Tirado did n't know any English before moving to the U.S. , and she was worried she would n't catch up to the level of her high school classmates . She credits the dedicated faculty with her progress . <p> " I feel competent now , " Tirado says . " Because of Cristo Rey , I 'm more committed to my studies . " Her goal is to become an accountant and be able to return to Pilsen/Little Village to help residents with their taxes . " A second family " <p> Tirado 's story is exceptional , but nearly all students at Cristo Rey are first- or second-generation Mexican Americans . A decade ago , Father Jim Gartland , S.J. spent nine months researching how best to meet the needs of this underserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on doors , and listened to everyone he could : residents , local business owners , pastors , parents , principals . <p> In a neighborhood where the two overcrowded , gang-ridden public high schools reported graduation rates of just over 50 percent , the top request was for more educational opportunities . The Jesuits rose to the challenge and opened the high school in an old Catholic elementary school building that had closed . <p> Six years later , Cristo Rey formalized its ad hoc campus ministry program to complement the religion classes and to help instill students with Catholic values and a sense of religious identity . The office organizes monthly liturgies , annual retreats , and prayer opportunities . " We invited faculty and staff to be a part of the spiritual life committee , " says Gartland . " Out of 50 , 36 joined . It 's an incredible group . We had too many volunteers . " <p> Students , too , appreciate the ministry focus . " We really get to know each other when we go on retreats , " says Miguel Blancarte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I consider it a second family . " <p> While almost all students at Cristo Rey are Catholic , only about half at De La Salle North Catholic and Verbum Dei are . The network requires that all its schools be Catholic . And while Cristo Rey , Verbum Dei , and Denver 's Arrupe are run by the Jesuits , De La Salle North Catholic , the first school to replicate the model , is run by the Christian Brothers . <p> Matt Powell , president of De La Salle North Catholic , first heard Cristo Rey president Father John Foley , S.J. at a workshop he attended . " John said the Jesuits developed the model , but it 'll take the Christian Brothers to replicate it . He knew it was so in line with our mission . " <p> Although the Christian Brothers already ran a school near Portland , they planned to open this one in North Portland , an area where many parishes , schools , and other ministries had been shut down or consolidated over the past few decades . Until Powell heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did n't have a clue how to fund this school if it were n't tuition-driven . " <p> So the Christian Brothers joined in . Soon more than a dozen different orders , dioceses , and lay groups had embraced the movement 's mission . Cleveland 's St. Martin de Porres is a lay initiative endorsed by the Jesuits and the Sisters of Humility of Mary . And while Austin 's Juan Diego is run by the diocese , five of its 10 faculty are religious : two are Holy Cross brothers , two sisters are Marianites of the Holy Cross , and one is a Franciscan priest . <p> " Bringing different religious orders and lay people together has been great , " says Kristy Blackmore , who serves as a liaison between each school and the network . " People put their egos aside for this work . " <p> Representatives of each school meet this month to hash out what the Catholic connection means for the whole network and what common values they want to highlight . One element that has taken root is a culturally focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dia de la Raza ( Day of the Race ) in October and Dia de los Muertos ( Day of the Dead ) in November . Students and faculty in Austin celebrate Saint Juan Diego 's newly official feast day on December 9 , and Las Posadas later in the month . <p> Perhaps the most admirable and some times elusive aspect of the schools is the balance they aim to strike between Catholic values and corporate savvy . Does the importance of their work with companies like Dell Computers , Bank One , or Leo Burnett Advertising interfere with the Catholic message ? <p> " The reality is our kids are going to go off and work somewhere , and chances are they 'll be part of corporate America , " says Theilman . " I 've come down on the side that it 's better to get them exposed to this world . We 're working with kids from low-income communities . By introducing them to the business world , they have the option to decide if that 's for them or not . <p> " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to the classroom and have a really good discussion about what Nike 's doing , " says Thielman , referring to the company 's use of sweatshop labor to make athletic gear . " They can do their own research ; they can think about the facts . It 's a great moral challenge . " <p> But that challenge can be difficult to meet when teachers still have to cover math , English , biology , and history . <p> " The reflection piece is not where we want it to be yet , " says Huelskamp . Independently , some teachers already include it in their lesson plans : recently a social studies class did a critique of practices and policies of corporate America . " But we have to build that into the curriculum , and it has to go beyond what we 're doing now . " <p> The schools still have time to work out the kinks . While the foundation funding is meant to help develop 16 network schools by 2008 , the reality that fewer urban Catholic high schools will be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this model . <p> And that may benefit many others besides the students . <p> " There 's such bad press about teenagers , " says LaSalle Bank 's Dwyer . " Then you meet these kids . They 're so helpful . They share what goes on with them at school . They want to get good grades . They want to go to college . It 's refreshing to see young people who really want to succeed .

On any given day , about a quarter of the students are at work , so ifs hard to have an all-school function . The academic year starts earlier and ends later than other schools . The school day is longer , too : LA. ' s Verbum Dei starts at 7:30 a.m. and ends at 3 p.m . They 've got a strict dress code and attendance policy . There 's not much room for elective classes , and it 's a one-track , college-prep school , so there are no provisions for students with learning disabilities . Even the sports programs are somewhat compromised . If there 's a practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , tough . That goes for games , too . The policy did n't go over well at Verbum Dei , the first school to shift from a traditional tuition-driven model . <p> " This school was definitely known as an athletic powerhouse , " says Jamie Mainvielle , vice president of development at Verbum Dei . The 41-year-old school in Watts had been struggling financially , and enrollment had plummeted from a high of about 400 to 125 . Although two nearby Catholic high schools had closed , Mainvielle says , Cardinal Roger Mahony wanted to keep this one running . In an area where only 38 percent of public high school students graduate , Verbum Dei was worth saving . The Jesuits came aboard in 2000 to help revive the school . <p> To focus on its new priorities and revamped schedule , the all-boys school  --  currently the only single-sex school in the network  --  suspended its football program the year prior to and the first year of the new model , " It was a big deal for students , and for some parents as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduating class under the new model had just 12 members . <p> But many others were excited . This year 115 freshman enrolled , and the 26 seniors who toughed it out as the school was going through the transition are doing OK , Mainvielle says . " Here are 16-year-olds who get business cards from company vice presidents who say , ' If you need anything , call me . ' " <p> Today the school , whose students come from throughout South Los Angeles , has an enrollment of 247 . " Now we 're financially stable ; we 're growing , " says Mainvielle . " We 're reaching more students who normally would n't be able to afford a Catholic college prep high school . " <p> Meanwhile , the sports program is holding its own . In the school 's first year under the corporate work-study model , the basketball team won the conference championship . And this year , football is back " It 's a big deal , " says Mainvielle.  --  Heather Grennan Gary <p>         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
