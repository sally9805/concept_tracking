In Colombia , job opportunities are , shall we say , limited , even for a young woman as heartbreakingly beautiful as Maria ( Catalina Sandino Moreno ) . When we meet her , she is stripping the thorns off roses for a wholesale florist  --  hating the boss , the degrading working conditions , the paltry pay . <P> The alternative is being a " mule , " smuggling heroin into the U.S. That involves swallowing packets of the drug ( 62 of them in her case ) in Colombia and excreting them once she has cleared customs in El Norte . It 's ugly work ( you may want to avert your eyes while she is endlessly swallowing the drugs )  --  and dangerous too . If a packet breaks , the heroin will kill the carrier . But , of course , the money is great  --  thousands of dollars for a week 's unpleasantness , enough to lift Maria 's fractious family out of poverty and pay for the birth of the baby she is carrying . <P> In a way , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What we come to care most about in writer-director Joshua Marston 's film is how his heroine achieves the state promised by his title , Maria Full of Grace . Our emotional investment in her derives primarily from the astonishing performance of Moreno , 23 . <P> This is not merely a matter of fresh-faced beauty . It has more to do with the unmediated openness of her work . Playing a 17-year-old , she never imparts the slightest hint of calculation in her reactions . She is pure instinct  --  at once , for example , eager for boys yet wary of them  --  full of flashing anger , impatient for adventure , sexual and otherwise , yet also full of doubts , which assail her when she thinks no one is looking . This is n't acting , it 's behaving . And it is behaving with a point . Without quite knowing it herself , this child-woman wants to become the good person that she inarticulately senses is hidden beneath her heedless petulance . <P> Marston does n't make that easy for her in this unpretentious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York City . Her friend Lucy ( Guilied Lopez ) sickens and dies when heroin poisons her . Another friend , Blanca ( Yenny Paola Vega ) , turns out to be at once rebellious and dependent when she and Maria are stranded , broke and friendless , on the New York streets . Yet somehow Maria prevails . <P> Immigrant fictions are always hymns to persistence , to scrambling for a hard , narrow , marginal place in the newfound land . They also depend for their effectiveness on a lack of overt sentiment . And that may be the best thing about Maria Full of Grace . Maria 's circumstances may keep changing , but she accepts them and the consequences of her desperate responses to them ; she makes no special pleas for herself ; she just keeps moving ahead , never entirely sure where she is going . Vulnerable , always obliged to master new difficulties , she elicits our sympathy  --  even finally our love  --  without ever suing for it .  --  By Richard Schickel         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
