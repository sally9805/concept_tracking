London 1811 May 14 Just before midnight Lord Beecham stopped dead in his tracks . He turned around so quickly that he nearly tripped over a huge potted palm . He could n't believe it . He had to be wrong . She could n't have said that , could she ? He looked for the woman he had just heard speaking . He parted two huge palm fronds and peered into the Sanderling 's library , a long , narrow , shelf-lined room just off the ballroom . Where the library was filled with dark-bound tomes , cobwebs in gloomy corners , and just one small branch of candles casting shadows , the ballroom was overflowing with lit candles , plants , and at least two hundred guests , all of them laughing , dancing , and drinking too much of the potent champagne punch . The woman he had heard before spoke again . He took a step closer to the dimly lit library . Her voice was rich , tantalizing , filled with laughter . " Really , Alexandra , " she said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing the word , saying it slowly to yourself and letting it caress your tongue as you say it , does n't it conjure up all sorts of delicious scenes of dominance ? Ca n't you just see yourself ? . You are completely at the mercy of another , that person is in total control , and there is nothing you can do about anything , You know something is going to happen , you 're dreading it , your heart is pounding , you 're afraid , so very afraid , yet it 's adelicious sort of fear you feel . You know , deep down , that you are anticipating what is to come . You ca n't wait for it to come , but there is nothing you can do except imagine what will be done to you . Ah , yes , your skin is rippling with the excitement of it . " There was dead silence . Wait , was that heavy breathing he heard ? Lord Beecham , whose very active imagination had conjured up a vision of himself standing over a beautiful woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her head and her legs , spread , to the posts of his bed , knowing that in just a few minutes , he would remove her clothing , one lovely garment at a time , slowly , ever so slowly , and " Oh , goodness , Helen . I have to fan myself . I believe my bosom is palpitating . You are far too good at painting word pictures . What you describeit sounds terrifying and wonderful . It rather makes my mouth water . It also sounds like a grand production that requires a lot of planning . " " Oh , yes , but that is part of the ritual . It is very important that it be planned perfectly . You are part of the ritual , the most important part , if you are the one in control . It requires that you be constantly inventive , that you do n't continue to rely on the same old disciplines . Remember , anticipation of something unknown is a very powerful thing . To be effective , discipline must constantly grow and change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people nearby to witness the discipline . This makes the recipient all the more frightened , his senses more heightened , his thoughts more focused . It is an amazing process . You will have to try it . Both sides of it . " More deep silence . Try it ? He wanted to run into that room this very instant and try everything he could possibly envision or dream about . His fingers were already on his cravat , ready to jerk it off so he could tie the wrists of the woman speaking , together over her head , so she would be helpless , her eyes large and frightened and excited as she stared up at him , her lips parted . Damnation , he had only one cravat , the one he was wearing . He needed at least two . He shuddered , imagining the smooth flesh of her wrists as he lightly wrapped the cravat around and around them , then pulled them bound , over her head He heard a deep sigh . " All of that is well and good , Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A list of disciplines , if you will . From mild disciplines to the most rigorous . " He realized suddenly that he knew that voice . Good God , it was Alexandra Sherbrooke . He could n't believe it . On second thought , he pictured Douglas Sherbrooke in his mind 's eye , that big , hard man who had reputedly kept his wife happy for eight whole years now . And Alexandra wanted to know about discipline ? To try on her husband ? What a delightfully wicked idea . Who was the woman speaking to her , this Helen ? " On the other hand , " Alexandra said after a moment , " I would like to know how you know so very much about discipline . " " I have read every book , every article , every paperboth scholarly and secularever penned on the subject . I have seen every painting , etching , and drawing of disciplines employed throughout the world and throughout the ages . Now , the disciplines in Chinagoodness , talk about inventive . The drawings show that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then Alexandra said , her voice lowered a bit , as if she were leaning closer to this other woman , speaking in confidence , but he could still make out her words . " Helen , you are laughing at me . All right , I accept that you know all about discipline . Now , you must force yourself to come to my level . You have told me how you discipline your servants . You have told me about the ritual , how to build to a climax , how to squeeze out every tantalizing drop of fear and excitement during the discipline to achieve the result you wish . " Now I want to go directly to the extreme pleasure end of things . I want specifics . I am talking about physical pleasure , Helen . I want to know exactly what you would do to a man to drive him to the brink of madness . Since you have read every tome written about the subject , you must know something that would help me . " Lord Beecham would not have moved if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and started kissing him . Now this was a kicker . Alexandra Sherbrooke wanted to know how to drive Douglas to the brink of madness ? That made no sense . Driving a man like Douglas to the brink would require very little effort on her part . It would probably require an effort of ten seconds , no more . Actually , any man who was still breathing was a suitable candidate . He himself , for example . Suddenly it simply became too much . He was eavesdropping on two ladies discussing discipline , for God 's sake . He was lurking there behind a palm , listening to them , sweating , and ready to remove his cravat . It was not to be borne . Lord Beecham could n't hold it back . It just burst from his mouth . He laughedsomething he did n't normally do because he was , after all , a man of the world ; a lazy nod or a slightly contemptuous snicker was usually more fitting . And so what poured out of his mouth sounded a bit rusty , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a laugh , a good strong laugh , and it just kept rolling out of him . He realized they could hear him . That would never do . He tried so hard to stop laughing that he hiccupped . He clapped his hand over his mouth and quickly slipped behind another-giant palm tree . And none too soon . " I know I heard someone , Helen . It was a man and he was laughing . Oh , dear , you do n't think it was Douglas , do you ? No , Douglas would come right in here and laugh in our faces . Then he would look at me with a smile in his eyes and tell me to forget the thought of disciplining him , that he is in charge . I am tired of his controlling everything . Eight years is a long time , Helen . I want to make him wild first , for once . " " Well , that ca n't be too difficult . Simply distract him when he is reading the Gazette . Start nuzzling his ear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you done this already ? " Dead silence . " Oh , dear , you are scarlet to your hairline , Alexandra . " " I have bitten him , Helen , I have . My bites simply take place in a different context . There is no Gazette lying about . " " A context that Douglas has provided ? " " Yes . You know , it 's just that Douglas has only to look at me , perhaps give me a small touch anywhere with his hand or his mouth , and I lose every shred of thought . I puddle right on the floor , directly in front of him . It just does not stop , Helen . Help me . Oh , dear , what if he is out there , listening ? Now he knows what power he wields over me . " " Trust me , he already knows . Now , you 're right , of course . If it had been Douglas , he would be standing right in front of us , laughing his head off . But then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin disciplining him this very nightthat is , if he did n't decide to discipline you first . " Alexandra sighed . " Goodness , you mean it ? You 're serious here , Alexandra ? Does n't Douglas ever let you have control ? Eight years of one-sided marital sorts of things ? From everything I 've read , this is n't good . The Italians , especially , believe that participation in lovemaking should be balanced . You must pull yourself together . " " It 's difficult once Douglas turns his attention on me . I would like to read what the Italians have to say about this . " " I will lend you a treatise on it . Now , you can not allow Douglas-always to discipline you first . You must focus your mind , Alexandra . " Alexandra 's eyes nearly crossed . She shuddered delicately . " Douglas has never said anything at all about discipline . I 'm sure he 's never done any to me . " Helen laughed and patted her cheek . " From everything I 've read , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discipline on you and you do n't even realize it . You 're just having fun . " " Do you really think so ? I wonder what specific sorts of things that Douglas enjoys with me one could call discipline ? Perhaps I shall ask him . " " Or perhaps not , at least not yet . " " Whatever he does , it 's true that I do sometimes forget to think , " Alexandra said , then squared her shoulders , " but that 's another problem , one I will have to solve . " Her shoulders squared even more and her magnificent bosom achieved new prominence . " I will have to learn how to retain my own control if I want to have a chance of controlling Douglas . I will have to have a specific goal in mind , a course that I will have to follow . I will get the upper hand of Douglas . The brink of madnessyes , Helen , that is where I want to dispatch Douglas . You must tell me specifically what I am to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She knew she should keep her mouth shut , but she could n't help herself . She said on a deep , wistful sigh , overflowing with exquisite memories , knowing that Alexandra would be enraged within moments , " Ah , even when I was fifteen and I first saw Douglas and fell in love with him , I knew instinctively that he would n't be a clod . I knew he would excel , and I wanted to be the female he chose to excel upon . Such a pity that it was n't meant to be . " She sighed again , a sad , forlorn sigh . Helen watched beneath her lashes as Alexandra 's eyes narrowed remarkably , and her voice turned mean and low . " Helen , I will not tell you again . You will forget those early years of infatuation with Douglas . You will forget those tender feelings you cherished for him when you were too young to realize what was what . " " Yes , " Helen said at her most humble , her head bent to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She hoped Alexandra could n't hear the laughter in her voice . Lord Beecham heard the laughter . And then he realized that here he was , a man of immense savoir faire , hiding behind huge green palm fronds , hanging on these women 's every word . He had n't yet seen the disciplinarian , but he could see Alexandra Sherbrooke now . She was looking around , just a bit apprehensively , her fingers splayed over her incredible bosom . It was too bad Douglas insisted she keep all that lovely white flesh more covered than not . It was n't at all the style . God gave women bosoms to flaunt , and every woman he knew flaunted , except Alexandra Sherbrooke . Everyone had seen Douglas drag his wife into a corner from time to time to pull up her bodice if the thought there was too much white flesh showing . A pity . Lord Beecham loved breasts : bountiful breasts like Alexandra 's that would overflow a man 's hands , small breasts that were ripe and sweet , breasts pushed up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He loved to bury his face in a woman 's breasts . He got hold of himself . Who was the other woman , the self-proclaimed mistress of discipline ? He knew only that her name was Helen . Lord Beecham was not normally a skulker , but he had to know who she was . He waited , veiled by the palm fronds , until , finally , the two ladies came out of the Sanderling 's library . He nearly dropped his glass of champagne when he saw Helen . She was the woman he had seen riding in the park with Douglas . He remembered remarking to himself then that he wanted a better look at her . Now he was getting it . She had to be nearly as tall as he was , but there all resemblance between them ended . His imagination soared to Mount Olympus for suitable comparisons . She was sculpted like a goddess , statuesque and beautifully curved , skin so white it was alabaster , and her hairsurely even goddesses did n't have hair like that , thick and pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore it twisted atop her head , making her appear even taller , with long , lazy curls caressing the white flesh of her shoulders , Her eyes were bluer than Aphrodite 's , her smile so charming , so utterly seductive , it could have belonged to Helen of Troy . He would wager that this new Helen could launch even more ships . Lord Beecham had just lost his wits . Frankly , his literary-inspired imagination had made him produce tripe . She was a woman , just a woman , and her name was Helen . She might be on the magnificent side , but she was still only a woman , nothing more , nothing less . He had seen women who were more beautiful , had bedded women who were more beautiful . She was not a goddess , not even close to a siren of myth . She was just a very big girl who happened to have very nice hair of a shade that sparked poetry in a man 's soul . And she had spoken authoritatively of discipline . All other things being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched Helen and Alexandra walk away from him , down the corridor to the ballroom . She was n't a young , untried girl of eighteen either , newly released from the schoolroom to prey upon the hapless bachelors of London . No , she had been released a goodly number of years ago , which meant she was well married and knew exactly what was whatand that was surely an utterly excellent thing . He had always preferred married women . What man did n't ? They were safe . They wanted what he wanteda bit of excitement , a bit of warmth , a new companion to add spice and passion . They did n't usually whine or carp when he was ready to move on . He did not have to worry about their husbands , most of whom were his friends and who bedded other friends ' wives just as he did . Many men and women were not discreet , and that sometimes stretched civilized manners to the limit . Lord Beecham , however , never spoke of his conquests . There was n't any need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brag . For some reason , he could not escape the gossips ; no matter how silent he remained He tossed down the rest of his champagne as the two women disappeared from his view back into the ballroom . He rubbed his hands together . Helen was a very big girl , He spread his fingers out . He thought of her breasts . Were his hands big enough for her ? Oh , yes , he thought , his hands would make do quite nicely . He looked at his hands , pictured her breasts , and knew that if he had been speaking just then , he would doubtless have been stuttering . Why were they talking about discipline ? His flesh rippled . He pictured Helen on her back , her white arms pulled above her head , her wrists tied with two of his softest cravats to the posts at the head of his bed . A woman who was well versed in the art of discipline ? She had read everything ever written about it ? Had she also employed everything she had learned ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a heady thought , one that made him swallow a bit convulsively . When he reached the ballroom he looked and looked , but the big girl was gone . He was n't worried . He would simply call upon Alexandra and , with his exquisite finesse , discover Helen 's address and the name of her husband . He hoped Alexandra would cooperate . He had stopped trying to seduce her at least six years ago , when one evening in the midst of one of his more effective offerings she laughed at him . It had wounded him greatly . He was a renowned loverat least that was what the gossips were always saying . But in the end , he quite liked Alexandra Sherbrooke , despite her appalling preference for only her husband in her bed . He liked her husband as well , all the more so once Douglas determined he would n't have to kill him for trying to seduce his wife . It was nothing more than attempted poaching , and that , Douglas had told him some years before , he would let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many couples like the Sherbrookes in London . Exactly what did the big girl know about discipline ? Like Alexandra , he wanted specifics , He could n't wait to find out . Other than her far-flung reading , had her husband taught her ? Or a lover ? Lord Beecham wanted her in his bed , and he wanted her there very soon . He would be a lover who would teach her something altogether new about discipline . He would take his fill of her and when they eventually parted , she would never forget him . Whenever she spoke of discipline after her time with him , she would remember him , and smile . He rubbed his hands together in anticipation even as he wondered if her hair was long enough to fall over her shoulders and curl lazily around her breasts . Lord Beecham was a man with a very detailed imagination . He saw her beneath him , all of her , stretched out , smiling up at him , and her hands were busy , very busy . He was forced once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon . Tomorrow night would fit nicely into his schedule . His fingers clenched at the emerging picture in his mind , a very big picture . So much white canvas .
