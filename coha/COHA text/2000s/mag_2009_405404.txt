MELISSA JOAN HART opens up about the struggle she faced to lose weight after her two pregnancies -- and the pride she feels now that she has gotten back her bikini body . Melissa Joan Hart can still picture the " horrifying " moment in 2005 when , while pregnant with her first child , she was shaving her legs " and I looked down and I had tons of cellulite around my knees ! " she says . Having gained 55 lbs . and getting up to 170 lbs . on her 5 ' 2 " frame , " I knew I was huge , " Hart admits . " But that was crazy . " Still even that discovery was n't as devastating as what she went through last June , when unflattering bathing-suit shots -- taken only three months after Hart , then about 155 lbs. , gave birth to her second son -- led to cruel Internet attacks about her body . ( One blog went so far as to blast her for " giving pregnancy a bad name . " ) " I still read blogs about me discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Everyone still thinks I 'm huge . But I 'm not anymore ! " While it 's true that one look at the actress 's new , 113-lb. bikini body leaves no doubt she is " in the best shape of my life , " as she puts it , Hart understands the confusion . After all , the public has grown accustomed to seeing celebs ( like Hart 's close friend , My Name Is Earl star Jaime Pressly ) back in their skinny jeans a scant six weeks post-pregnancy . " There are enormous pressures put on you in Hollywood , " she says . In fact when Hart returned to the audition circuit after her first son was born , " everyone kept asking , ' How does she look ? Is she fat ? ' Everyone wanted me to dance for them and show my behind -- they literally wanted to see how big my behind was ! It was horrifying . " Hart says that experience " motivated me " to hit the gym , and she was back in shape in about 10 months . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV movies , including Holiday in Handcuffs . ) The second time around , however , reclaiming her slim figure ( she had some 35 lbs . to lose ) took her 14 months and " a lot of effort , " she admits . " It did n't happen by magic -- it was as hard for me as it would be for anyone else . " Especially because she refused to commit to the 4:30 a.m. workouts that had kept her trim during her teen years on the hit shows Clarissa Explains It All and Sabrina , the Teenage Witch . " I did n't want to take any time away from spending it with my sons , " she explains . Instead she tried to lose weight beginning last April by first getting rid of all the candy she 'd stashed in the 5,000-sq. - ft .

" It 's really hard for me to say ' no ' to something , whether it 's a cupcake at a party or popcorn at the movies . " By January , despite her efforts , she still could n't fit into her pre-baby jeans . " It was hard for her to accept that she 'd had two kids and her body does n't respond the way it used to , " Wilkerson says . But Hart was n't ready to give up , especially with her 33rd birthday looming . " I thought , ' Losing weight will only get harder as I get older , so I better do it now , ' " she says . " I wanted to prove to myself I could do it . " Hart admits she was " lucky " to be able to consult both a nutritionist and a trainer ( see box ) , but says that her biggest inspiration came from the women around her -- including Pressly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as her own mom , Paula , 53 , who gave birth to seven children " and is tiny ! " Hart says . " I realized I do n't have to be heavy just because I have kids . " Adds Pressly : " She finally took time to take care of herself . I 'm blown away by how amazing she looks . " Hart admits to being impressed with herself as well . " I never thought I 'd pose in a bikini again ! " she says , noting that her last scantily clad photo shoot was a decade ago . ( See " Growing Up in Public " on the previous page . ) " To do it two kids and 10 years later ? I 'm so proud ! " What would make her even prouder , however , is if -- after all her hard work -- she maintains her svelte figure . " My biggest fear is that I 'm going to blow it again , " admits Hart .

Yep : a candy store ! Wo n't that be a problem for Hart ? " No , actually , " she says . " I love having a candy store because it reminds me of childhood . The only thing I plan to eat there is the nonfat frozen yogurt .
