I had paid for my purchases , but the security gate at Barnes &; Noble was squealing anyway . The problem was Al Franken 's Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them : A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right . The cashier had not deactivated its anti-theft insert , but I could n't help wondering if the book was screeching at being trapped in the same bag with liberal-bias critic Bernard Goldberg 's best seller Arrogance : Rescuing America from the Media Elite . ( One Franken chapter is titled " I Bitch-Slap Bernie Goldberg . " ) " Let me desensitize Mr. Franken for you , " the guard said . <P> I 'm afraid scientists have not invented a machine capable of desensitizing Mr. Franken . Nor Bill O'Reilly , Michael Moore , Ann Coulter , Molly Ivins , Laura Ingraham and the rest of the authors and TV and radio hosts divided by beliefs but united by a common employer : the burgeoning American anger industry . It 's a multimedia platform  --  TV and radio shows stoking book sales and vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rise of Rush Limbaugh and the conservative-publishing boom . But the monologue has become  --  O.K. , not a dialogue , but at least two angry monologues , as liberals have discovered the cathartic power of mass-market name calling . ( Moore 's Dude , Where 's My Country ? is No. 1 on the Nov. 23 New York Times best-seller list , with Franken at No. 3 , while a liberal talk-radio network appears to be in the works for next year . ) " People feel more strongly because they perceive the stakes as being much higher , " says publisher Steve Ross of Crown Publishing and its conservative Crown Forum imprint . " The more extreme the polemic , the greater the potential number of book buyers . " <P> What do these political voices have in common ? They 're not political  --  not in the " vote for my side and we 'll do X , Y and Z for you " sense anyway . They do n't emphasize the substantive matters that define one as liberal or conservative  --  tax policy or affirmative action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your convictions are a given . What you want , apparently , is to be told  --  at Wagnerian volume and in Proustian detail  --  what a bunch of S.O.B.s the other guys are . <P> For starters , they  --  the universal epithet  --  are liars . Besides Franken , David Corn holds forth for 337 pages on The Lies of George W. Bush ; Coulter followed Slander : Liberal Lies About the American Right with Treason : Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism . They are also elitists and exclusionary . Writes Ingraham in Shut Up &; Sing , liberal elites " think where we live  --  anywhere but near or in a few major cities  --  is stupid . " ( Ingraham , says her " About the Author " note , " lives in the Washington area . " ) They control the media  --  notwithstanding the best seller you are holding or the hit radio show you are listening to  --  and their followers are sheep . Franken observes that Coulter 's readers " buy her books out of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know or need to know . " Franken disregards the fact that people buy his book for exactly that reason  --  proof No. 1 that he is good at his job .
