" Do you really think this will work ? " <p> The question , posed by consumer advocate DeAnne Cuellar , was directed at Tony Wilhelm of the Commerce Department 's National Telecommunications and Information Administration . It was February 2008 , and Wilhelm , head of consumer education , had just explained the digital TV coupon program to a group of consumer advocates that included Cuellar . <p> The program , core to the government 's plan to turn the USA into an all-digital TV market , offers $40 coupons  --  two per household  --  toward converter boxes that turn digital signals into analog . TVs that use antennas must have a converter ; otherwise , they 'll go dark once the switch happens . Cable and satellite TV customers are n't affected . <p> Cuellar , director of the Texas Media Empowerment Project in San Antonio , was concerned that the $1.34 billion program would run out of money before the nation 's neediest  --  the poor , elderly and disabled  --  could apply . For many , she pointed out , free TV is their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her not to worry . <p> " He said most coupon programs have low redemption rates , so he did n't expect many people to use or cleaning products and such  --  which have average redemption rates of 10% or less . " They were confident that everything would be fine . " <p> Cuellar 's recollection of the exchange is shared by two other people who attended the private briefing : Chris Murray , senior counsel for Consumers Union , and Gene Kimmelman , vice president of international policy for the same group . Wilhelm says he does not recall the meeting or the exchange . <p> As it turned out , everything was not fine . NTIA exhausted its budget just 10 months later , forcing Congress to scramble to keep the program afloat . <p> The coupon program " was supposed to help everyone who was losing a piece of equipment that was perfectly functional  --  their ( analog ) TV , " says Kimmelman . " Instead , at every stage  --  from the drafting of the ( DTV ) bill to actual implementation  --  this program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Congress , digital TV was supposed to give " free " TV , a fixture in U.S. living rooms for more than 50 years , a much-needed face lift . Instead , the program got so bogged down that lawmakers , in the midst of dealing with an epic financial crisis , had to run to the rescue . <p> Why did the program go off the rails so badly ? <p> Interviews with more than a dozen current and former NTIA officials , consumer advocates , White House personnel and others suggest a combination of factors . Among them : bureaucratic bumbling , penny-pinching , NTIA 's narrow interpretations of provisions in the DTV bill , and relentless warring about money between Republicans , who wanted to spend as little as possible on the DTV transition , and Democrats , who had concerns about funding from the start . Some sources would speak only on the condition of anonymity because they 're not authorized to comment publicly and fear retribution from current and former employers . <p> Demand was seriously underestimated <p> " There were so many hurdles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program working successfully were very small right from the beginning , " says Rep. Ed Markey , D-Mass. , former chairman of the Subcommittee on Communications Technology and the Internet , which has congressional oversight of NTIA . <p> NTIA 's assumptions about the popularity of the coupons proved woefully off target . As of March 18 , more than 54.2 million coupons had been requested , and 25.7 million redeemed . Average redemption rate to date : 55.7% . <p> The agency 's miscalculations came into play in dramatic fashion in late December . In a conference call with reporters , Meredith Baker , then acting director , said NTIA was effectively out of money and would have to put consumers on a waiting list . Within days , more than 100,000 requests had piled up . By February , there were more than 4 million , and thousands of requests were pouring in daily . <p> Factoring in processing time  --  4 to 6 weeks  --  wait-listed consumers had little hope of receiving their coupons in time to beat the DTV deadline , then set for Feb. 17 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DTV transition date by four months , to June 12 . Lawmakers also included $650 million in new coupon funding in the stimulus package approved in February . <p> Ushering in a new era <p> America 's DTV plan has been a long time in the making . In 1996 , the Federal Communications Commission and Congress started talking about ushering in a new era in TV broadcasting . Talk was spurred , in part , by the Telecom Act of 1996 , which called for a transition to an all-digital TV format when most consumers had abandoned analog TV . <p> There were many potential benefits . Digital technology is far more efficient than analog , so broadcasters could squeeze more channels into the same space . Pictures would be sharper ; colors , brighter . <p> But there was an even bigger motivating factor : money . <p> The Bush White House , with the support of many Republicans , was pushing for tax cuts for wealthy Americans . They hoped to find a way to make up for the deficit of funds the U.S. Treasury would receive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue to help reduce the USA 's growing deficit . <p> The solution : a spectrum auction . <p> By selling airwaves that had been given to broadcasters  --  free of charge  --  decades earlier , lawmakers figured they could raise $10 billion , at least . The spectrum could penetrate walls and other obstacles , making it ideal for wireless broadband and public safety communications . <p> Many Democrats , including Markey , supported the auction plan , but they also had concerns . The transition , they pointed out , would idle as many as 70 million analog TVs . Democrats said it was only fair for the government to make sure the switch was cost-free for affected consumers . <p> Ultimately , the DTV bill passed with bipartisan support . It was signed into law by then-president Bush in early 2006 . <p> NTIA , which oversees U.S. spectrum usage , was directed to implement the coupon program . Its budget : $1.5 billion , including $1.34 billion for the coupon program . That was far less than the $4 billion Democrats had requested but a lot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America 's TV spectrum hit the auction block a year later , in January 2007 . The sale raised $20 billion , about double what many had expected . The money was earmarked for a range of government uses , including $7.2 billion for deficit reduction . <p> According to two former officials who would not speak for attribution , NTIA 's decision-making during this period was based primarily on two factors : the DTV switch date  --  Feb. 17 , 2009  --  and the coupon program 's budget . <p> Many decisions boiled down to : " What money do we have , and how far can we make the money stretch ? " one of the former officials recalls . <p> Against that backdrop , the agency made a number of pivotal decisions : <p> *Expiration rules . The DTV bill requires that coupons expire after 90 days . The bill is silent , however , about whether a household may reapply once coupons expire . <p> NTIA took the position that households could not reapply . After 90 days , expired coupons were reissued to other consumers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of limiting the number of people who could use coupons , Kimmelman says . One of the former NTIA officials says the decision was influenced by funding limitations . <p> *Definition of " households . define the word . As a result , NTIA was free to use its own discretion . <p> NTIA decided to use the U.S. Census definition  --  a single , residential dwelling where one family lives , with no shared dining or living facilities . The agency 's decision eliminated broad swaths of America , including nursing homes , drug-rehab centers and residential hotels . People living in unconventional arrangements  --  such as ministers who maintain living quarters in their churches  --  were also out . <p> *P.O. boxes . Though the DTV bill is silent on this issue , NTIA decided that people who only used P.O. boxes , with no fixed address , were n't eligible for coupons . ( Native American reservations were the exception . ) <p> The former NTIA officials say this decision was driven , primarily , by concerns about fraud , which could have drained funds . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of P.O. boxes but decided that would have been time-consuming and expensive . <p> *Bulk mail . In the DTV bill , Congress instructed the agency to use the U.S Postal Service , but left the details up to NTIA . The agency decided to use bulk mail , which is far cheaper than first class but slower . Mail traveling first class arrives in days ; bulk mail can take weeks . <p> The bulk-mail decision came under harsh criticism in late December , when NTIA ran out of funds and coupon requests started piling up . <p> Even with all those limitations , however , consumers continued to clamor for the government 's $40 coupons . <p> When the FCC conducted a citywide test of DTV in Wilmington , N.C. , in the fall , NTIA received requests for almost 76,000 coupons  --  five times the number of over-the-air TV households that Nielsen said existed there . Part of that was due to the efforts of the FCC , which had blanketed the local market with public service ads leading up to the test . <p> According to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in media attention would result in artificially high coupon requests . For that reason , the same person says , NTIA groused when the FCC made plans to put a DTV clip-and-mail coupon request in AARP The Magazine , circulation 25 million . <p> The FCC placed the ad anyway . <p> Defending the NTIA <p> The NTIA 's Baker , who has since left the agency , declined multiple requests for an interview . She did send an e-mail to USA TODAY shortly after her resignation : " NTIA effectively and efficiently administered the program that Congress designed , " she wrote . <p> However , in an interview with Communications Daily , a Washington-based trade publication , Baker had plenty to say . She blamed NTIA 's penny-pinching ways , in part , on the White House 's Office of Management and Budget , which is responsible for making sure federal programs adhere to their budgets . <p> In the interview , published Feb. 5 , Baker makes it clear that money was a constant concern . NTIA " ran a very strict program because Congress gave us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cites the bulk-mail decision as an example of the agency " being sensitive to cost . " <p> Said Baker , " We really tried to make this a bipartisan effort for everyone to know what we were doing , exactly what the numbers were , because it was Congress program , and Congress was going to have to make changes if changes were to be made . " <p> Baker 's comments stand in contrast to NTIA 's report to Congress last fall . In the Nov. 6 report , submitted on Baker 's watch , the agency assured Congress that it had " sufficient funds " to meet its coupon obligations and could possibly " return as much as $340 million to the U.S. Treasury . " <p> In the report , NTIA allowed that there were also " less optimal but possible " scenarios : that consumer demand could surge significantly , causing NTIA to exhaust its funds . <p> In that unlikely event , the agency noted , " NTIA will notify the Congress and address the matter as quickly as possible . " <p> How many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard fix on how many TVs might be affected . When the DTV bill was passed , estimates varied widely , from a low of 20 million to more than 70 million . Republicans , who wanted to spend as little as possible on DTV , tended to embrace the smaller estimate ; Democrats favored the higher one . <p> NTIA decided to do a little sleuthing on its own . <p> Since cable and satellite customers would n't be affected by the switch , NTIA figured they would n't request coupons in large numbers , one of the former officials recalls . <p> NTIA soon hatched a plan : It would ask cable and satellite TV companies to provide numbers of subscribers , by market , to the government . The agency planned to cross-reference those lists with U.S. population maps to come up with a guesstimate of the number and location of free-TV households . <p> The response from cable and satellite ? <p> " They turned us down flat , " the same source says . " They told us they considered that information to be confidential . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coupon demand were based not on anticipated demand but on simple arithmetic . The agency took its $1.34 billion budget and divided it by $40 , the face value of coupons . Total : 33.5 million . <p> That figure  --  33.5 million  --  became NTIA 's coupon cap . In reports to Congress , the agency said demand could ratchet as high as 50 million by the time the program shut down . To pay for the difference , the agency was counting on millions of people allowing their coupons to expire unused . <p> NTIA was silent about what happened to all the people who inadvertently allowed their coupons to expire . But the reality was this : They were flat out of luck . <p> On track for June ? <p> What 's the lesson here ? Kimmelman says the DTV program underscores the folly of any government trying to bring about major cultural and societal shifts on the cheap . <p> " Programs designed to help people that are run by people whose only interest is minimizing cost are doomed to fail , " he says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration that wants this program to be successful , " says Markey , the current chairman of the House Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment . As a result , he says , " I think we will finally have a successful transition " to digital TV on June 12 . <p> As for NTIA , at the request of lawmakers , it is now sending out coupons via first-class mail . Congress has also directed the agency to allow households whose coupons have expired to reapply . <p> NTIA began processing those requests on Monday . <p> " There were so many hurdles and detours ( for consumers ) that the chances of the program working successfully were very small right from the beginning .
