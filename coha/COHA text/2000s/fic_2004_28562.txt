Chapter One Dear Mr. Smith , It is our duty at this time to inform you of the death of Marcus McCoy due to an unfortunate , unforeseen encounter with a grizzly bear while fly-fishing in Alaska on June 8 of this year , and per the stipulations set forth in his last will and testament , to make formal his acknowledgment of one Mitchell Davis Smith , aka Mitch Smith , age 31 , of the Circle S Ranch , Rural Route 5 , Whiskey Ridge , Colorado , as being his son and heir to an equal portion of his estate . It is the wish of Joseph McCoy , father to Marcus McCoy , grandfather to Mitch Smith , and founder of McCoy Enterprises , that you immediately assume your rightful place in the family home and business with all due haste and utmost discretion to preserve the family 's privacy . Regards , David Weidman , Esq . Weidman , Biddermier , Stark Mitch squinted at the letter in his hand , the June Colorado morning sun reflecting brightly off the expensive white business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top rail of the corral and tipped his tan cowboy hat back with his finger . His squint deepened into a frown as he tuned out the bawling Angus calves behind him . Even after a second reading , the letter still made no sense , and the day was n't even that hot yet . He settled his forearms on the rail and looked up at the leggy redhead who 'd brought his men to a standstill in the middle of inoculating some prize calves . She 'd sashayed from her rented white pickup truck in high-heeled black boots , snug black jeans and a black knit top to hand-deliver the envelope bearing this letter to him . It was n't every day that a woman who looked like a darker-haired Nicole Kidman in one of his crews ' favorite movies , Days of Thunder , showed up in U-Haul Rental pickups . He could tell from the conspicuous lack of whistles and shouts behind him that she still had their interest . He nodded at the letter . " What is this ? " " Just what it says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she 'd had a little too much fun the night before . Which might explain her lack of anything bordering on friendliness . He certainly knew the type . And did his damnedest to steer clear of them after almost committing himself to one . He would n't have had a dime to his name within a year . He waited for more explanation , staring at a distorted reflection of himself in her dark , rimless sunglasses . Did n't get any . Great . A tight-lipped female when he wanted answers . So far all she 'd done was ask if he was the Mitch Smith who owned this ranch , then handed him an envelope with a ringless left hand . " Well , Miss ... ? " She hesitated a moment , shifting her weight to one scary pointy-toed boot , then supplied , " Sullivan . Alison Sullivan . " " Well , Miss Sullivan , what I think this is , is a mistake . I 've heard of the McCoys - at least the ones who own all those stores that sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCoys ? " At her emphatic nod , he shook his head . " Then I sure as hell have never met one . Or know anyone who has . Sorry , but you 've got the wrong man . " He folded the letter up and tucked it into the envelope . When he handed it back to her , she just stared at it , her lips - much fuller than Miss Kidman 's , he realized now that he really looked at her - parting slightly . She shook her head with conviction . " No . There 's no mistake . " She yanked off her sunglasses and pinned him to the rail with the prettiest blue-green eyes he 'd ever seen . " The McCoys hired me - my private investigation firm - to find you , Mitchell Davis Smith , deliver this letter , then escort you to Dependable , Missouri . " She took the letter back out of the envelope and thrust it at him . Mitch had no choice but to take it . " Ah . That explains the bad-to-the-bone look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence . " Then there must be another Mitchell Davis Smith running around some-where , because I think I would have known if my natural father had been - " he glanced down at the letter " - Marcus McCoy . Him being a member of one of the richest families in the states , and all . " She took a step closer to the rail and placed her hand where his forearms had been , lending an air of intimacy to their conversation that would catch any man 's interest . She glanced at the three men behind him and leaned forward more . Not that Carl , Juan or Richie could hear her over the noise of calves unhappy about being separated from their mamas . In a low voice she said , " No , you would n't have . Your mother was paid a million dollars to keep your true paternity a secret . " Mitch froze . A million dollars . Mitch , we 're so proud of the man you 've become . It 's time for you to have the money I received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a million dollars before taxes had been sitting in an account since before he 'd been born . The interest it piled up had been more than enough for the down payment on his maternal great-grandfather 's old ranch . The ranch he 'd yearned to bring back into the family since his mother first lulled him to sleep as a kid with stories of her visits here when she 'd been a child . He wiped away the echo of his mother 's words along with the sweat on his brow . " No , " he insisted to the gorgeous P.I. , as well as to the spark of doubt that flared in his chest . " My mom 's first husband , my real father , died before I was born . " She nodded as if he 'd just told her his cattle were the other white meat . " And you know this how ? " His hackles rose . " For your information , when the man I 'd thought was my dad , Ed Smith , was diagnosed with heart disease around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed was n't my biological father . She was afraid I would worry about having inherited his health issues . " ( Continues ... )
