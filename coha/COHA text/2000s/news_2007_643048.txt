<p> By the end of David Harrower 's " Blackbird , " a drama that promises to be the most powerful of the season , Jeff Daniels and Alison Pill are about as naked as it 's possible for two people to be . <p> I did n't say nude . " Blackbird , " which opened last night at the Manhattan Theater Club under the masterly direction of Joe Mantello , is about a sexual relationship that transforms , cripples and paralyzes . But no one removes much clothing during the production 's time-suspending 90 minutes  --  only an overcoat , a scarf and , briefly , a pair of shoes . <p> What is completely stripped away , in a process as unavoidable as it is painful , is a full armor of defenses that a man and woman have assembled with watchful care in the 15 years since they last saw each other . That was when Ray ( Mr. Daniels ) was around 40 ; Una ( Ms. Pill ) was 12 . Those numbers alone suggest the degree of damage done . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " embodied with uncanny strength and subtlety by Mr. Daniels and Ms. Pill , Ray and Una are peeled down to their barest souls . Shivering and unprotected , they are so utterly in the raw that you feel you should look away . On the other hand , how could you possibly ? <p> Theatrical as well as emotional nakedness may explain why " Blackbird , " a bare-bones drama by a largely unheralded 40-year-old Scottish playwright , stole this year 's Laurence Olivier Award for best new play in London from flashy and deserving contenders by big-name writers , like Tom Stoppard 's " Rock ' n ' Roll " and Peter Morgan 's " Frost/Nixon . " <p> Unlike those plays , which deconstruct world events with bright intellectual showmanship , " Blackbird " is theater at its most elemental : one man , one woman , one set and a head-to-head confrontation , about events long past , that occurs in real time . Its characters are not well spoken or even particularly insightful . What emerges as truth  --  which is less a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should make it clear that " Blackbird " is a recollection of what , by any legal definition , was sexual abuse . The word " abuse " comes up in the play , and it sticks in the throats of the characters . They have had it drilled into their heads by assorted medical and legal functionaries over the years . Like most of the words they use , " abuse " is woefully inadequate . <p> Mr. Harrower has said that " Blackbird " was inspired by the case of Toby Studebaker , an American ex-marine who , in 2003 , ran off with a 12-year-old British schoolgirl whom he had met in an Internet chat room . But the play is in no way a literal dramatization of real events . <p> In " Blackbird " both characters come from the same town . ( Location and even nationality are unspecified . ) Ray lived alone , down the street from Una and her family . They first spoke at a barbecue in her parents ' backyard . What followed over the succeeding three months led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life over with a new name in a new town . <p> " Blackbird " is set in the office building where Ray ( now Peter ) works and where Una has found him after seeing his picture in a trade magazine . Scott Pask 's set  --  a litter-cluttered staff room in the midst of antiseptic corridors  --  is imbued with a sterile squalor , a sense of anonymous mess . <p> Through frosted windows you glimpse Ray 's colleagues moving , pausing , looking in . You ca n't help being curious about these faceless creatures , who are no doubt curious about the young woman who has shown up late in the afternoon , demanding to see Peter Trevelyan . <p> Such curiosity , the basis of so much narrative art , is what shapes " Blackbird . " You can imagine Mr. Harrower reading about Mr. Studebaker and reaching beyond the initial shock and puzzlement to speculate on just what was going through his head . We all do that , to some extent . Most of us , though , do n't have Mr. Harrower 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Every detail in the staging of " Blackbird " must be exactly right for an audience to stay with it . Not only is its subject uncomfortable , but also its sustained intensity . The New York cast and creative team provide an unflinching immediacy and emotional commitment that suspends judgment and obviates prurient jokiness . <p> This is essential , since for " Blackbird " to work , you have to accept it as a love story  --  a tragic , horrible love story that destroys lives , but a love story all the same . Mr. Daniels and Ms. Pill are extraordinary in guaranteeing this acceptance . <p> Throughout the tangle of recriminations and accusations and explanations of Una and Ray 's dialogue , the balance of power shifts , warps and finally melts altogether . Mr. Daniels and Ms. Pill make it clear that the Ray and Una of the play 's first moments are provisional constructs of personalities , devised to allow maimed souls to function as if life did n't hurt them every waking second . <p> Maybe it 's because he inhabits his characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know rather than as figures in a play or movie , but I keep forgetting just how good Mr. Daniels is . His performance here is on the high level he has brought to films from " Something Wild " to " The Squid and the Whale . " As Ray , he has the bureaucratic shell of the petty office power-wielder down pat . But he also makes it inevitable that the shell will crack . <p> Ms. Pill , who appeared on Broadway in " The Lieutenant of Inishmore , " digs so deep into Una that you 're afraid she may lose herself there . The ravenous needs to wound and to be accepted inform every gesture . And even more than Mr. Daniels , she seems to exist in the past and the present simultaneously . <p> In Una 's big aria of reminiscence , staged with mesmerizing restraint by Mr. Mantello , Ms. Pill looks and sounds no more than 12 , and this illusion of youth comes like a punch in the stomach . You realize that Una is hopelessly frozen in time . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Other works of fiction have , of course , centered on the relationship between an under-age girl and a grown man : Vladimir Nabokov 's novel " Lolita " and , more recently , Paula Vogel 's Pulitzer Prize-winning play , " How I Learned to Drive . " What makes " Blackbird " different is how little reflective distance it allows you . <p> With both Nabokov and Ms. Vogel , language becomes a sort of consolation , a means of giving shape to the chaos of pain and loss . For Mr. Harrower , whose characters speak in dissolving fragments and exploding words , there is no such relief . <p> Both Una and Ray have read deep in the psychological literature of sexual abuse , and it does n't begin to encompass what they experienced . The miracle of " Blackbird " is that it does .
