<p> LOUISVILLE - Jimmie Heuga does n't want to be one of those athletes who lives in the past , but sometimes he catches himself doing just that , and it embarrasses him . <p> He does n't want to spend a lot of time thinking about that historic day 40 years ago this month when he and Billy Kidd became the first American men to win Olympic medals in alpine skiing . He would rather be pursuing his ' calling , ' helping fellow victims of multiple sclerosis to live fuller lives through the Jimmie Heuga Center in Edwards . <p> He ca n't do that from his room at the Balfour Retirement Community , where he has lived since June 1998 . Above the bed is a picture of him and Kidd exulting with coach Bob Beattie after their historic achievement in the slalom at the 1964 Innsbruck Olympics . Kidd won the silver medal , Heuga the bronze . <p> ' It 's embarrassing , but I think about it , ' Heuga says in his wheelchair . ' I 'm a little embarrassed because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' and I do . I think a lot of it is because I 'm in this holding pattern the last five years . I ca n't pursue my calling , and that is the center . ' <p> The Heuga Center , which marks its 20th anniversary this year , teaches MS patients to manage their disease with exercise , a revolutionary approach when Heuga pioneered it two decades ago . MS is a disabling disease that attacks the central nervous system , and there is no known cause or cure . <p> ' I did n't dwell on ski racing in the past , ' Heuga says . ' I was into the calling I had then , to find ways for people with a personal challenge to get on with their lives through the emotional anchor that was a fitness program . ' <p> Heuga , 60 , does n't want to be in this ' assisted living ' facility that has been his home for nearly five years . He has three sons in Edwards , ages 14 , 12 and 9 . All of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to see them race often . He sees them a couple times a month . <p> ' It 's terrible , ' Heuga says . ' I just miss my children so much . ' <p> MS is not fatal - those afflicted have normal life expectancies - but Heuga worries about his future . The funding that covers the $ 72,000 annual cost of his stay at Balfour is scheduled to expire in three years . Heuga has no idea what will happen then . <p> ' That 's why I say I 'm in a holding pattern , ' Heuga says . ' I feel like I 've been thrown out of an airplane , and I 'm not in a position to do much about it . I 'm going for it until I crash . ' <p> United forever in a glorious moment for the U.S. Ski Team , Heuga and Kidd are closer today than they were when they won their Olympic medals the same weekend the Beatles made their debut on ' The Ed Sullivan Show .

' He has really , really done a great job . ' <p> Heuga says Kidd has been a better friend to him than he has been to Kidd . <p> ' I think it 's just the opposite , ' Kidd says . ' He 's been a really good friend and an inspiration to me . I just feel bad I have n't done more for him . For anybody who knows him or has met him or even read about him , Jimmie is just bigger than life . He 's the kind of person you read about and you think , ' He just could n't be that good , he could n't be that true , ' but he is . He 's just an amazing guy . ' <p> They were a couple of 20-year-old kids in 1964 . Heuga was from Tahoe City , Calif. , Kidd from Stowe , Vt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older teammate who had done great things in ski racing but had never won an Olympic medal . Innsbruck would be his last chance , and they knew it . <p> Beattie had been telling everyone who would listen that his men would win medals , but they were shut out in the downhill and the giant slalom . Heuga was disqualified in the GS for missing a gate , and to this day it rankles him because GS was his best event . <p> The slalom was their last shot . <p> ' I thought we were the best-conditioned team in the world , I thought we had the most character , and I thought we had great athletes , ' Beattie said . ' We all felt ( winning medals ) was possible , and we all felt it was going to happen , frankly . But there was a lot of pressure to make it happen . ' <p> Heuga could see he was skiing better than the European stars in training , but he knew they would be more formidable on race day . <p> ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medal , ' Heuga says . ' Although you dreamed of winning medals , and you knew you were beating these guys , the idea of winning a medal was inconceivable . ' <p> Heuga was in third place after the first run , Kidd sixth . When Heuga finished the second run and saw he was in third place behind Kidd and gold-medal winner Pepi Stiegler of Austria , he threw down a glove in disgust . <p> ' My first reaction was that I had lost the race , I had gotten third , ' Heuga said . ' The next reaction was , ' Gee , I won an Olympic medal , and it 's never been done before . " <p> It was n't long before Heuga began to think about Werner , his hero who finished eighth after falling in his last important race . Even in his moment of glory , Heuga felt ' shattered in many ways ' because Werner would end his legendary career without a medal at the Olympics or world championships . Heuga 's reaction says a lot about Werner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt Buddy ought to have the medal , ' Kidd remembers . ' He just felt awkward , and he wanted to give Buddy his medal because he deserved it more than we did . ' <p> Heuga and Werner were roommates at the Olympics , and Heuga agonized over what would happen when he walked into their room with his medal . He was relieved when he arrived and Werner was n't there . Werner had gone to dinner with his wife . <p> ' I did not know what I was going to say to him , ' Heuga says . <p> Werner was killed two months later in an avalanche in Switzerland . Had he lived , Werner would have become director of skiing at Jackson Hole resort . That job went instead to Stiegler , whose daughter Resi is now a promising young racer on the U.S. Ski Team . <p> Pepi Stiegler was diagnosed with MS in the early 1990s . <p> Heuga competed in the 1968 Grenoble Olympics , finishing seventh in slalom and 10th in giant slalom , but he already was beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease in 1970 . <p> He was able to ski conventionally until five or six years ago . Now he skis while seated in a ' bi-ski , ' a chair mounted with two parabolic skis . <p> ' I really love it , ' Heuga says . <p> Heuga , Kidd and Beattie had a celebration in Steamboat this month to mark the 40th anniversary of Innsbruck . With 18 inches of fresh powder blanketing Mount Werner , they took a trip down Buddy 's Run , named after their old friend and mentor . <p> " Jimmie just had a big grin on his face , powder streaming up in his face , " Kidd said . " We had an absolutely great time .
