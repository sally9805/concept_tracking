One night last November , Randy Fogle was snoring in bed . His wife Annette poked him and told him to roll over . This has happened regularly over 24 years of marriage . But on this particular night , Randy said , " I ca n't . " Annette asked why not . " I ca n't , " he repeated . " If I roll over , I 'm going to drown . " Months later , thinking back on the incident , Annette smiles ruefully . " I let it go , " she says . " I figured in his mind he was back underground . " <P> That Randy Fogle should dream of drowning is not surprising . Unlike the millions of other people who battle demons or wolves or rising waters on their bad nights , Fogle actually lived the nightmare , escaping only at the last minute . A year ago , in the midst of a bad case of level-orange jitters about national security , Americans got a bit of good news . After three days of suspense , nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Somerset County , Pa. , gasping as the last of their air leached away , were delivered from their flooded mine . The first figure millions of TV viewers saw emerge from the land of the dead , cradled in a yellow rescue capsule , was the crew foreman , Randy Fogle , 45 , sent up before the others because he had developed a heart palpitation . <P> No , the occasional nightmare seems natural . Far more surprising is that today , a year after the disaster , Fogle , as he has been doing each workday for the past six months , will go down into the mine . He will descend and walk through tunnels that were deathtraps , past sledgehammer marks that commemorate his crew 's desperate attempts to be heard on the surface , past the date , time and initials he scrawled in chalk on a coal face the day of the disaster  --  7/24/02 3:55 p.m . RF . Fogle is the only one of the rescued miners who has returned . <P> On July 24 last year , shortly before 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor , startling Annette . At almost the same instant , millions of gallons of water in an abandoned mine slammed through a thin coal wall and into the working mine , called Quecreek No. 1 , where her husband and his eight-man crew were drilling bituminous coal . " It blew hard , " he now says . " It was moving fast . Oh , man , it was wicked . " Over the next 78 hours , the nine men fled rust-colored torrents through 4-ft. - high tunnels and ended up stranded in a huge air bubble . Its oxygen became so depleted that by the time their rescuers managed to bore a fresh air hole for them , they had begun to vomit . <P> No one passed this unimaginable trial by water better than Fogle . In the first chaotic minutes , he picked up Dennis Hall , who had fallen into the swift-running current , and threw him to the safety of a raised conveyor belt . " He saved my life right there , " says Hall . Later , Fogle risked his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miner Mark Popernack , who was stranded on the other side . It is Fogle who is acknowledged to have kept his crew focused , adamantly refusing to let them give in to despair . If anyone epitomized their fierce solidarity , which Pennsylvania Governor Mark Schweiker captured in the phrase " Nine for nine " before he had even met them , Fogle did so .
