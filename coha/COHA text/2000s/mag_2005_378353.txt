" I 'm a father of nine , all of them grown up on grits , " says Kofi Moyo from his home on the South Side of Chicago , where he presides over his blended family 's kitchen with diligence , passion and Southern-inflected love . " All of my kids are grits champions . Maybe that 's because I approach grits as something different . Grits with cheese , tomato and pepper . Fish and grits . Lately I 've begun working diligently on shrimp and grits . I 've knocked a few people over with that one . " Moyo , a gemologist by training and a brand builder by trade , belongs to the growing ranks of husbands and fathers who are the primary cooks for their families . He keeps his pantry well stocked with onions , garlic , ginger , fennel , curry and cayenne . And when his kids , now grown , head home for a visit , they phone in orders . " Dr. Moyo , my daughter who 's an intern in child psychology , she loves fish-head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Moyo explains . " Then I have another daughter who wants Thanksgiving every day . In the summertime they expect all kinds of smoked fish . Catfish , trout , I 'll smoke anything . " <P> When not manning the smoker or stove Moyo spends much of his time organizing Real Men Cook , a nationwide cooking- for- charity event that takes place on Father 's Day . Real Men volunteers whip up huge batches of their favorite dishes , people buy tickets , and everyone chows down . This year , the event 's 16th , Moyo expects 1,000 male cooks to feed 30,000 mouths in 10 cities . Moyo also has a new cookbook , Real Men Cook : Rites , Rituals , and Recipes for Living ( Fireside Press ; 192 pages ) . He aims to help local charities , such as Chicago 's Community Mental Health Council . In the past 15 years he has raised $800,000 . But he also wants to make a point : cooking is not just women 's work ; it 's a vital part of being a responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moyo and his 1,000 real men represent a larger trend . Over the past 40 years , as women poured into the labor force , the average amount of time that American married men spend cooking has tripled , from seven minutes per day to 22 , according to John Robinson , co-author of Time for Life : The Surprising Ways Americans Use Their Time . Meanwhile the number of hours married women spend cooking has fallen from 88 minutes per day to 48 . A recent survey by Mediamark Research found that the number of men ages 25 to 54 who cook for fun at least twice a week has jumped 36% in the past 10 years . No wonder Mark O'Connor at the Food Network reports " a definite increase in male viewership . " <P> In many cases , men are home on the range because their wives are stuck at the office . In other households , dads prefer to retreat to the kitchen while their spouses wrangle the kids . Then there are the families in which the guy is just clearly the better or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
