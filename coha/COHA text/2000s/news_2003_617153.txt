<p> Three years ago , an interesting little phrase turned up missing in Atlanta-based Southern Co. ' s financial reports . <p> Tucked for years into boilerplate passages about capital improvements , the phrase said Southern Co. subsidiaries had an ongoing capital program to " upgrade and extend the useful life " of power plants . <p> The problem with that wording ? <p> It describes an activity the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said undermined the Clean Air Act 's intent to shutter old , dirty-burning power plants . That activity  --  as carried out by the country 's coal-fired power industry  --  also broke the law , according to government lawsuits against Southern Co. and a handful of other large utility companies . The lawsuits were filed the year before the wording disappeared . <p> Power plant " life extension " work lay at the heart of a U.S. Justice Department enforcement campaign that hit the courts in late 1999 . <p> Federal investigators alleged that Southern Co. and others performed extraordinary , but illegal , work to keep the old plants running . The industry countered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintenance , repair and parts replacement at those plants and that the EPA changed the rules . <p> " No one ever suggested that these projects were not routine maintenance , repair and replacement ... until EPA tried to change the rules retroactively in the 1999 enforcement initiative , " Southern Co. spokeswoman Tiffany Gilstrap said . <p> But the words that appeared for years in Southern 's annual financial reports  --  known as 10-Ks and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission  --  suggest that the company did in spirit exactly what the Justice Department claimed . Southern Co. today says the words refer " primarily " to work done at its hydroelectric plants , although its 10-Ks make no mention of that and some subsidiaries that used the wording  --  or similar wording  --  do n't operate hydroelectric plants . <p> The SEC filings by Southern Co. , as well as its state regulatory filings and federal court documents involving several of the nation 's largest utilities , show the industry spent years attempting to hew to the letter of the air law while flouting its spirit . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces of worn-out power plants  --  and calling the work " routine . " <p> The old plants are still running today , more than three decades after they were exempted from the Clean Air Act 's toughest and costliest requirement on the assumption they would wear out and be retired . Those plants are major contributors to acid rain , smog and mercury contamination . <p> While the Bush administration this fall weakened the legal basis for the Justice Department 's enforcement effort , the campaign continues . Several federal lawsuits are pending , including the one against Southern Co. , and more than a dozen state attorneys general have vowed to pick up the fight if the federal government continues to back away . <p> Rules change <p> The move by the Bush administration this fall involved a change to what is called the " new source " rule . It was regulators ' sometimes-confusing attempt to spell out what Congress meant when it exempted old plants  --  including old coal-fired power plants  --  from a requirement to install state-of-the-art pollution controls . <p> The law said the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modified . <p> The intent was clear , as a state court judge wrote in a 1979 Alabama Power case : " The statutory scheme intends to grandfather existing industries , but the provisions concerning modifications indicate that this is not to constitute a perpetual immunity . " <p> Power plants , designed to last 30 to 40 years , were not to be modified in ways that kept them and their exempted status alive , unless modern pollution controls were installed . <p> But interpretation of the rules was another matter . <p> A modification was described as a physical change that increased emissions . But what 's an increase ? The industry and its watchdogs went around and around . <p> The industry said only physical changes that increased a plant 's hourly emissions could be counted as a modification . <p> Regulators said changes that allowed deteriorating units to run more hours  --  to run more like new , in other words  --  also were n't allowed . <p> Most work targeted in the lawsuits increased hours of operation , rather than hourly emissions , said Bruce Buckheit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eric Schaeffer , a former enforcement chief at the EPA , said the Justice Department lawsuits established that those kinds of upgrades had " increased pollution , in some cases by more than ten thousand tons . " Schaeffer , who resigned from the EPA in protest over the Bush administration 's stance on pollution , is now director of the Environmental Integrity Project at the Rockefeller Family Fund . <p> Industry spokesman Bill Brownell called regulators ' interpretation " astonishing . " <p> Brownell , a lawyer for the Utility Air Regulatory Group , said , " Nearly every industrial facility in the country repairs or replaces some worn-out major piece of equipment nearly every year . Because the repaired or replaced equipment works better , the facility typically has less downtime ... and will operate longer . " <p> The new-source rules also meant that power companies had to get permits before beginning projects that might increase emissions . For two decades , the coal-fired power industry , including Southern Co. , routinely did n't apply for those permits . <p> Instead , the industry herded even its largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was required for routine maintenance , replacement or repair . <p> As an administrative judge would write in 2000 , in a ruling against the Tennessee Valley Authority , the routine maintenance loophole became " the exception that swallowed the rule . " <p> Defining ' routine ' <p> Court records in the power plant lawsuits show how liberally power plants classified projects as " routine . " <p> In the TVA case , for instance , a company maintenance supervisor testified about one project the company had described as " routine . " He opined that a project done every 36 years on a plant designed to last 30 to 40 years should n't qualify as " routine . " <p> Another employee described a " routine " replacement project that cost more than the plant 's annual maintenance budget : " This was part of a strategy to make these plants run for an indefinite period of time , " he said . <p> Another " routine " project required construction of a railroad track inside the plant to get it done . <p> The industry 's explanation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was using a special definition of " routine "  --  which was anything other utility companies have done . <p> The definition was based on a 1992 finding against a Wisconsin utility , which had tried to pass off an unprecedented huge replacement project as routine . <p> The fact that the replacement project was bigger than other utilities had ever attempted became part of why the Wisconsin company lost . The project 's size became the industry 's new ceiling . Companies did smaller projects duplicated by someone else . <p> So far , two federal judges and one administrative law judge have ruled on the " everybody does it " definition of " routine . " In a Duke Power case now headed to trial , a North Carolina federal judge sided with industry on that and most other legal issues . Judges in the Tennessee Valley Authority case and another case , involving Ohio Edison , disagreed and found against those companies . <p> The industry definition of routine , according to the TVA opinion , would " stretch the exception beyond recognition . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any other coal power company defendant . The case is likely to go to the Supreme Court . <p> Modified language <p> The other lesson of the Wisconsin case was to stop saying " life extension . " <p> The EPA argued successfully that the Wisconsin utility 's use of the phrase showed the purpose of its project was not routine . <p> Until then , though , talk of life extension was common . <p> A trove of documents in the court records reveals an industrywide " life extension " campaign intended to keep grandfathered plants running 10 , 20 or even 30 years longer than they were designed to last . The industry even held conferences about it . <p> Court records include a 1986 industry group report acknowledging that coal power plants were to have been replaced by new ones at the end of their 30-year life spans , but that life extension could keep them alive " 50 to 60 years or longer " and avoid " regulatory constraints . " <p> The industry knew the risks . A TVA memo on an industrywide life extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to be considered reconstruction , EPA might try to apply the new-source performance standards . This could erase one major advantage of life extension over new plant construction . " <p> The records describe a " plant betterment/life extension " program at Ohio Edison and a " life optimization " program at American Electric Power , also based in Ohio . <p> AEP 's explanation of its program is particularly vivid . <p> In 1994 testimony to state regulators , the company said it carried out its program in phases beginning " several years prior to the end of a unit 's ' traditional ' lifetime , " in order to save Clean Air compliance costs by extending the 40-year lifetime of its coal plants by 10 to 20 years . <p> " In all cases , the achievement of a lifetime in excess of 40 years is directly dependent on carrying out the life optimization program . Such lifetimes simply could not be achieved without the unit modernization program , and without incurring the program 's considerable capital cost . " <p> Southern Co. mentioned life expansion to Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposing a new depreciation schedule for Georgia Power . Its coal-fired plants would last longer , it said , because of good maintenance and a planned life extension program : " Many companies have found it possible to delay generating unit retirements with relatively modest capital outlays , " its testimony said . <p> The industry 's defense of its behavior is that the EPA knew what it was doing and did n't care . <p> The industry produced as evidence a Reagan-era trade magazine article written by two EPA staffers that matter-of-factly discusses life extension as a way utilities were undermining the Clean Air Act . <p> The industry claimed to be blindsided by the EPA 's 1990s decision to enforce the law as it did . <p> That defense has been its most successful . The judge in the Duke case sided with the " blindsided " argument , to the glee of other defendants . <p> " The Duke Energy decision shows that industry was justified in relying on the understanding of the modification rule that had been communicated to the industry for the past 25 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The federal judge who found Ohio Edison in violation also cited a decades-long " abysmal breakdown " in EPA enforcement as part of the problem , and said he may take that breakdown into consideration in the case 's penalty phase . <p> He said the law was clear , though , even if enforcement policy was not . <p> The TVA judge was less sympathetic . " Those playing " perilously close to an area of proscribed conduct shall take the risk that they may cross the line , " he wrote . <p> The industry 's casual discussion of life extension largely ended after the Wisconsin case that also created the industry definition of " routine . " <p> Change of position <p> The language hung on in Southern Co. financial reports . But the company was more wary , as one company executive displayed in depositions during a 1998 Georgia Power rate case . <p> After a company consultant testified that the company 's projections of its power plants ' life spans were n't realistic without life extension capital spending , the company executive corrected him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are looking to remove and dismantle a large portion of the plant , keeping certain components and adding to it , in essence creating a new plant going forward , " the executive said . <p> " I am not aware that there are any plans for life extension at this time for any Georgia Power plant , " he said . <p> Justice Department lawyers were already combing through public service commission records by then . <p> They sued the following year .
