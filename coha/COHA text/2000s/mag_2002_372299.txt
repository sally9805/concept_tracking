When the targeteers at U.S. Central Command grew frustrated in their hunt for al-Qaeda fighters hiding in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan , they utilized a new tactic that turned the rugged terrain to their advantage : causing avalanches . With the help of U.S. Geological Survey maps and a Navy reservist who is a geologist in the civilian world , U.S. bombs triggered dozens of rock slides into forested areas where al-Qaeda troops were hiding . Warplanes dropped smart bombs on precise points where the geologist predicted they would act like jackhammers on rocky cliffs . The tactic had the advantage of surprise : enemy forces , relieved to see bombs explode at a distance , faced a rocky tidal wave seconds later . While there are no estimates of the number killed in the avalanches , Centcom considers the strategy a success , and could use it again when facing an enemy in rocky terrain . In addition to the casualties , says Air Force Lieut . Colonel Bradley Jones , " it had a tremendous psychological effect . " <P>  --  By Mark Thompson  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
