1 . Ash Wednesday // I was late . That in itself was a novelty . It was a dark , gusty evening in February 1969 , only a few weeks after I had left the religious life , where we had practiced the most stringent punctuality . At the first sound of the convent bell announcing the next meal or a period of meditation in the chapel , we had to lay down our work immediately , stopping a conversation in the middle of a word or leaving the sentence we were writing half finished . The rule which governed our lives down to the smallest detail taught us that the bell should be regarded as the voice of God , calling each one of us to a fresh encounter , no matter how trivial or menial the task in hand . Each moment of our day was therefore a sacrament , because it was ordained by the religious order , which was in turn sanctioned by the church , the Body of Christ on Earth . So for years it had become second nature for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it really was tolling for me . If I obeyed the rule of punctuality , I kept telling myself , one day I would develop an interior attitude of waiting permanently on God , perpetually conscious of his loving presence . But that had never happened to me. // When I had received the papers from the Vatican which dispensed me from my vows of poverty , chastity , and obedience , I was halfway through my undergraduate degree . I could , therefore , simply move into my college and carry on with my studies as though nothing had happened . The very next day , I was working on my weekly essay like any other Oxford student . I was study- ing English literature , and though I had been at university for nearly eighteen months , to be able to plunge heart and soul into a book was still an unbelievable luxury . Some of my superiors had regarded poetry and novels with suspicion , and saw literature as a form of self-indulgence , but now I could read anything I wanted ; and during those first confusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a source of delight and a real consolation for all that I had lost . // So that evening , when at 7:20 p.m. , I heard the college bell summoning the students to dinner , I did not lay down my pen , close my books neatly , and walk obediently to the dining hall . My essay had to be finished in time for my tutorial the following morn- ing , and I was working on a crucial paragraph . There seemed no point in breaking my train of thought . This bell was not the voice of God , but simply a convenience . It was not inviting me to a meeting with God . Indeed , God was no longer calling me to anything at all  --  if he ever had . This time last year , even the smallest , most mundane job had had sacred significance . Now all that was over . Instead of each duty being a momentous occasion , nothing seemed to matter very much at all . // As I hurried across the college garden to the dining hall , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of defiance had occurred on Ash Wednesday , the first day of Lent . That morning , the nuns had knelt at the altar rail to receive their smudge of ash , as the priest muttered : " Remember , man , that thou art dust and unto dust thou shalt return . " This memento mori began a period of religious observance that was even more intense than usual . Right now , in the convent refectory , the nuns would be lining up to perform special public penances in reparation for their faults . The sense of effort and determination to achieve a greater level of perfection than ever before would be almost tangible , and this was the day on which I had deliberately opted to be late for dinner ! // As I pushed back the heavy glass door , I was confronted with a very different scene from the one I had just been imagining . The noise alone was an assault , as the unrestrained , babbling roar of four hundred students slapped me in the face . To encourage constant prayer and recollection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day ; talking was permitted only for an hour after lunch and after dinner , when the community gathered for sewing and general recreation . We were trained to walk quietly , to open and close doors as silently as possible , to laugh in a restrained trill , and if speech was unavoidable in the course of our duties , to speak only " a few words in a low voice . " Lent was an especially silent time . But there was no Lenten atmosphere in college tonight . Students hailed one another noisily across the room , yelled greetings to friends , and argued vigorously , with wild , exaggerated gestures . Instead of the monochrome convent scene  --  black-and-white habits , muffled , apologetic clinking of cutlery , and the calm , expressionless voice of the reader  --  there was a riot of color , bursts of exuberant laughter , and shouts of protest . But whether I liked it or not , this was my world now . // I am not quite sure of the reason for what happened next . It may have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my essay , or that I was disoriented by the contrast between the convent scene I had been envisaging and the cheerful profanity of the spectacle in front of me . But instead of bowing briefly to the principal in mute apology for my lateness , as college etiquette demanded , I found to my horror that I had knelt down and kissed the floor . // This was the scene with which I opened Beginning the World , my first attempt to tell the story of my return to secular life . I realize that it presents me in a ridiculous and undignified light , but it still seems a good place to start , because it was a stark illustration of my plight . Outwardly I probably looked like any other student in the late 1960s , but I continued to behave like a nun . Unless I exerted constant vigilance , my mind , heart , and body betrayed me . Without giving it a second ? s thought , I had instinctively knelt in the customary attitude of contrition and abasement . We always kissed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community duty . This had seemed strange at first , but after a few weeks it had become second nature . Yet a quick glance at the girls seated at the tables next to the door , who were staring at me incredulously , reminded me that what was normal behavior in the convent was little short of deranged out here . As I rose to my feet , cold with embarrassment , I realized that my reactions were entirely different from those of most of my contemporaries in this strange new world . Perhaps they always would be . // But there may have been another reason why I kissed the ground that evening . Ever since my dispensation had come through , many of my fellow students and tutors had made a point of congratulating me . " You must be so relieved to be out of all that ! " one of them had said . " It never seemed quite right for you . " " How exciting ! " others had exclaimed . " You can start all over again ! You can do anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you ! " It was true , in a sense : now I could fall in love , wear beautiful clothes , travel , make a lot of money  --  all the things that , most people presumed , I had been yearning to do for the past seven years . But I didn ? t feel excited or relieved . I didn ? t want to do any of the things that people expected . I had no sense of boundless opportunity . Instead I felt , quite simply , sad , and was constantly wracked by a very great regret . When I pictured that dedicated Lenten scene in the convent , it seemed unbearably poignant because it was now closed to me forever . I mourned the loss of an ideal and the absence of dedication from my new life , and I also had a nagging suspicion that if only I had tried just a little bit harder , I would not have had to leave . There had been something missing in me . I had failed to make a gift of myself to God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , when I kissed the floor that night , I had unconsciously wanted  --  just once  --  to appear in my true colors to the rest of the world . // In Beginning the World I described how I had threaded my way through the tables , flinching from the curious gaze of the other students , until I was rescued by a group who had become my friends and who had kept a kindly but tactful eye on me during the past difficult weeks . There was Rosemary , a cheerful extrovert , who was reading modern languages ; Fiona , a gentler , more thoughtful girl ; her constant companion , Pat , who had been a pupil at one of the boarding schools run by my order ; and finally Jane , who was also reading English . All were Catholics . All had some experience of nuns . Jane retained a great fondness for the kindly semienclosed sisters at her rather exclusive school . Pat had actually known me as a nun , since I had been sent to help out at her school in Harrogate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholicism and convents were alien territory and who clearly intended to keep it that way . In Beginning the World I made them all tease me good-naturedly about my gaffe , question me about convent life , and express shock and horror at such customs as kissing the floor , confessing faults in public , and performing elaborate penances in the refectory . Maybe there was some discussion along these lines ; certainly people were curious , up to a point . But I doubt that anybody was really very interested . // These young women had been quite wonderful to me . It had been Rosemary , Fiona , and Pat who had marched me down to Marks &amp; Spencer a couple of hours after my dispensation had come through and helped me to buy my first secular clothes . Rosemary had cut and styled my hair , and all three had escorted me to dinner , my first public appearance as a defrocked nun . But they were probably wary of prying too closely into the reasons for what they could see had been a traumatic decision . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the convent we had been carefully trained never to tell our troubles to one another and it would never have occurred to me to unburden myself to my peers . And these girls had their own concerns . They too had essays to write ; they were falling in love , and trying to juggle the demands of concentrated academic work with those of an absorbing social life . They were making their own journeys into adulthood , and now that the drama of my exodus was over , they almost certainly assumed that I was happily reveling in my new freedom , and were content to leave well alone . // I also knew that they could not begin to imagine my convent existence . Occasionally one of them would express astonishment if I inadvertently let something slip . " My nuns weren ? t a bit like that ! " Jane would insist stoutly . " Your lot must have been abnormally strict . " Pat would look even more bewildered , because she and I had lived with exactly the same community , but her perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so modern and up-to-date , even sophisticated ! " she would protest . " They drove cars , were starting to go to the cinema again , and were changing the habit ! " Both girls would look at me reproachfully , because I was spoiling a cherished memory . Nobody likes to be told that things were not as they imagined . But I was quite certain that my own order had not been particularly austere , and agreed with Pat that it had been far more enlightened than many . Most nuns had observed these arcane rituals , had kissed the ground , confessed their external faults to one another , and were forbidden to have what were known as " particular friendships , " since all love must be given to God . That was why the reforms of the Second Vatican Council were so necessary . //
