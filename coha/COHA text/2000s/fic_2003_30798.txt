Acurdate de Acapulco , de aquellas noches , Mara bonita , Mara del alma ; acurdate que en la playa , con tus manitas las estrellitas las enjuagabas. - " Mara bonita , " by Augustn Lara , version sung by the composer while playing the piano , accompanied by a sweet , but very , very sweet violin ************** We 're all little in the photograph above Father 's bed . We were little in Acapulco . We will always be little . For him we are just as we were then . Here are the Acapulco waters lapping just behind us , and here we are sitting on the lip of land and water . The little kids , Lolo and Memo , making devil horns behind each other 's heads ; the Awful Grandmother holding them even though she never held them in real life . Mother seated as far from her as politely possible ; Toto slouched beside her . The big boys , Rafa , Ito , and Tikis , stand under the roof of Father 's skinny arms . Aunty Light-Skin hugging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the shutter clicks , as if she chooses not to remember the future , the house on Destiny Street sold , the move north to Monterrey . Here is Father squinting that same squint I always make when I 'm photographed . He is n't acabado yet . He is n't finished , worn from working , from worrying , from smoking too many packs of cigarettes . There is n't anything on his face but his face , and a tidy , thin mustache , like Pedro Infante , like Clark Gable . Father 's skin pulpy and soft , pale as the belly side of a shark . The Awful Grandmother has the same light skin as Father , but in elephantfolds , stuffed into a bathing suit the color of an old umbrella with an amber handle . I 'm not here . They 've forgotten about me when the photographer walking along the beach proposes a portrait , un recuerdo , a remembrance literally . No one notices I 'm off by myself building sand houses . They wo n't realize I 'm missing until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look at it for the first time and ask , - When was this taken ? Where ? Then everyone realizes the portrait is incomplete . It 's as if I did n't exist . It 's as if I 'm the photographer walking along the beach with the tripod camera on my shoulder asking , - Un recuerdo ? A souvenir ? A memory ? 1 . Verde , Blanco , y Colorado Uncle Fat-Face 's brand-new used white Cadillac , Uncle Baby 's green Impala , Father 's red Chevrolet station wagon bought that summer on credit are racing to the Little Grandfather 's and Awful Grandmother 's house in Mexico City . Chicago , Route 66-Ogden Avenue past the giant Turtle Wax turtle-all the way to Saint Louis , Missouri , which Father calls by its Spanish name , San Luis . San Luis to Tulsa , Oklahoma . Tulsa , Oklahoma , to Dallas . Dallas to San Antonio to Laredo on 81 till we are on the other side . Monterrey . Saltillo . Matehuala . San Luis Potos . Quertaro . Mexico City . Every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cousins-Elvis , Aristotle , and Byron-stick their tongues out at us and wave . - Hurry , we tell Father . - Go faster ! When we pass the green Impala , Amor and Paz tug Uncle Baby 's shoulder . - Daddy , please ! My brothers and I send them raspberries , we wag our tongues and make faces , we spit and point and laugh . The three cars-green Impala , white Cadillac , red station wagon-racing , passing each other sometimes on the shoulder of the road . Wives yelling , - Slower ! Children yelling , - Faster ! What a disgrace when one of us gets carsick and we have to stop the car . The green Impala , the white Caddy whooshing past noisy and happy as a thousand flags . Uncle Fat-Face toot-tooting that horn like crazy . 2 . Chillante If we make it to Toluca , I 'm walking to church on my knees . Aunty Licha , Elvis , Aristotle , and Byron are hauling things out to the curb . Blenders . Transistor radios . Barbie dolls . Swiss Army Knives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress shirts . Lace push-up bras . Socks . Cut-glass necklaces with matching earrings . Hair clippers . Mirror sunglasses . Panty girdles . Ballpoint pens . Eye shadow kits . Scissors . Toasters . Acrylic pullovers . Satin quilted bedspreads . Towel sets . All this besides the boxes of used clothing . Outside , roaring like the ocean , Chicago traffic from the Northwest and Congress Expressways . Inside , another roar ; in Spanish from the kitchen radio , in English from TV cartoons , and in a mix of the two from her boys begging for , - Un nikle for Italian lemonade . But Aunty Licha does n't hear anything . Under her breath Aunty is bargaining , - Virgen Pursima , if we even make it to Laredo , even that , I 'll say three rosaries . . . - Cllate , vieja , you make me nervous . Uncle Fat-Face is fiddling with the luggage rack on top of the roof . It has taken him two days to get everything to fit inside the car . The white Cadillac 's trunk is filled to capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car dips down low . There is n't room for anything else except the passengers , and even so , the cousins have to sit on top of suitcases . - Daddy , my legs hurt already . - You . Shut your snout or you ride in the trunk . - But there is n't any room in the trunk . -I said shut your snout ! To pay for the vacation , Uncle Fat-Face and Aunty Licha always bring along items to sell . After visiting the Little Grandfather and Awful Grandmother in the city , they take a side trip to Aunty Licha 's hometown of Toluca . All year their apartment looks like a store . A year 's worth of weekends spent at Maxwell Street flea market* collecting merchandise for the trip south . Uncle says what sells is lo chillante , literally the screaming . - The gaudier the better , says the Awful Grandmother . - No use taking anything of value to that town of Indians . Each summer it 's something unbelievable that sells like hot queques . Topo Gigio key rings . Eyelash curlers . Wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle is betting on glow-in-the-dark yo-yos . Boxes . On top of the kitchen cabinets and the refrigerator , along the hallway walls , behind the three-piece sectional couch , from floor to ceiling , on top or under things . Even the bathroom has a special storage shelf high above so no one can touch . In the boys ' room , floating near the ceiling just out of reach , toys nailed to the walls with upholstery tacks . Tonka trucks , model airplanes , Erector sets still in their original cardboard boxes with the cellophane window . They 're not to play with , they 're to look at . - This one I got last Christmas , and that one was a present for my seventh birthday . . . Like displays at a museum . We 've been waiting all morning for Uncle Fat-Face to telephone and say , - Quihubo , brother , vmonos , so that Father can call Uncle Baby and say the same thing . Every year the three Reyes sons and their families drive south to the Awful Grandmother 's house on Destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the summer , one in the middle , and one at the summer 's end . - But what if something happens ? the Awful Grandmother asks her husband . - Why ask me , I 'm already dead , the Little Grandfather says , retreating to his bedroom with his newspaper and his cigar . - You 'll do what you want to do , same as always . - What if someone falls asleep at the wheel like the time Concha Chacn became a widow and lost half her family near Dallas . What a barbarity ! And did you hear that sad story about Blanca 's cousins , eight people killed just as they were returning from Michoacn , right outside the Chicago city limits , a patch of ice and a light pole in some place called Aurora , pobrecitos . Or what about that station wagon full of gringa nuns that fell off the mountainside near Saltillo . But that was the old highway through the Sierra Madre before they built the new interstate . All the same , we are too familiar with the roadside crosses and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , her sons finally give in . That 's why this year Uncle Fat-Face , Uncle Baby , and Father-el Tarzn-finally agree to drive down together , although they never agree on anything . - If you ask me , the whole idea stinks , Mother says , mopping the kitchen linoleum . She shouts from the kitchen to the bathroom , where Father is trimming his mustache over the sink . - Zoila , why do you insist on being so stubborn ? Father shouts into the mirror clouding the glass . - Ya vers . You 'll see , vieja , it 'll be fun . - And stop calling me vieja , Mother shouts back . -I hate that word ! I 'm not old , your mother 's old . We 're going to spend the entire summer in Mexico . We wo n't leave until school ends , and we wo n't come back until after it 's started . Father , Uncle Fat-Face , and Uncle Baby do n't have to report to the L. L. Fish Furniture Company on South Ashland until September . - Because we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , imagine that . But that 's nothing but story . The three Reyes brothers have quit their jobs . When they do n't like a job , they quit . They pick up their hammers and say , - Hell you . . . Get outta . . . Full of sheet . They are craftsmen . They do n't use a staple gun and cardboard like the upholsterers in the U.S. They make sofas and chairs by hand . Quality work . And when they do n't like their boss , they pick up their hammers and their time cards and walk out cursing in two languages , with tacks in the soles of their shoes and lint in their beard stubble and hair , and bits of string dangling from the hem of their sweaters . But they did n't quit this time , did they ? No , no . The real story is this . The bosses at the L. L. Fish Furniture Company on South Ashland have begun to dock the three because they arrive sixteen minutes after the hour , forty-three minutes , fifty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - We are on time . It depends on which time you are on , Western time or the calendar of the sun . The L. L. Fish Furniture Company on South Ashland Avenue has decided they do n't have time for the brothers Reyes anymore . - Go hell . . . What 's a matter . . . Same to you mother ! It 's the Awful Grandmother 's idea that her mijos drive down to Mexico together . But years afterward everyone will forget and blame each other . *The original Maxwell Street , a Chicago flea market for more than 120 years , spread itself around the intersections of Maxwell and Halsted Streets . It was a filthy , pungent , wonderful place filled with astonishing people , good music , and goods from don't-ask-where . Devoured by the growth of the University of Illinois , it was relocated , though the new Maxwell Street market is no longer on Maxwell Street and exists as a shadow of its former grime and glory . Only Jim 's Original Hot Dogs , founded in 1939 , stands where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . 3 . Qu Elegante Pouring out from the windows , " Por un amor " from the hi-fi , the version by Lola Beltrn , that queen of Mexican country , with tears in the throat and a group of mariachis cooing , - But do n't cry , Lolita , and Lola replying , -I 'm not crying , it 's just . . . that I remember . A wooden house that looks like an elephant sat on the roof . An apartment so close to the ground people knock on the window instead of the door . Just off Taylor Street . Not far from Saint Francis church of the Mexicans . A stone 's throw from Maxwell Street flea market . The old Italian section of Chicago in the shadow of the downtown Loop . This is where Uncle Fat-Face , Aunty Licha , Elvis , Aristotle , and Byron live , on a block where everyone knows Uncle Fat-Face by his Italian nickname , Rico , instead of Fat-Face or Federico , even though " rico " means " rich " in Spanish , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no disgrace to be poor , Uncle says , citing the Mexican saying , - but it 's very inconvenient . - What have I got to show for my life ? Uncle thinks . - Beautiful women I 've had . Lots . And beautiful cars . Every year Uncle trades his old Cadillac for a brand-new used one . On the 16th of September , Uncle waits until the tail of the Mexican parade . When the last float is rolling toward the Loop , Uncle tags along in his big Caddy , thrilled to be driving down State Street , the top rolled down , the kids sitting in the back dressed in charro suits and waving . And as for beautiful women , Aunty Licha must be afraid he is thinking of trading her , too , and sending her back to Mexico , even though she is as beautiful as a Mexican Elizabeth Taylor . Aunty is jealous of every woman , old or young , who comes near Uncle Fat-Face , though Uncle is almost bald and as small and brown as a peanut . Mother says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can bet it 's because someone 's giving her reason to be , know what I mean ? It 's that she 's from over there , Mother continues , meaning from the Mexican side , and not this side . - Mexican women are just like the Mexican songs , locas for love . Once Aunty almost tried to kill herself because of Uncle Fat-Face. - My own husband ! What a barbarity ! A prostitute 's disease from my own husband . Imagine ! Ay , get him out of here ! I do n't ever want to see you again . Lrgate ! You disgust me , me das asco , you cochino ! You 're not fit to be the father of my children . I 'm going to kill myself ! Kill myself ! ! ! Which sounds much more dramatic in Spanish . - Me mato ! Me maaaaaaaatoooooo ! ! ! The big kitchen knife , the one Aunty dips in a glass of water to cut the boys ' birthday cakes , pointed toward her own sad heart . Too terrible to watch . Elvis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but by the time the neighbors arrived it was too late . Uncle Fat-Face sobbing , collapsed in a heap on the floor like a broken lawn chair , Aunty Licha cradling him like the Virgin Mary cradling Jesus after he was brought down from the cross , hugging that hiccuping head to her chest , murmuring in his ear over and over , - Ya , ya . Ya pas . It 's all over . There , there , there . When Aunty 's not angry she calls Uncle payaso , clown . - Do n't be a payaso , she scolds gently , laughing at Uncle 's silly stories , combing the few strands of hair left on his head with her fingers . But this only encourages Uncle to be even more of a payaso. - So I said to the boss , I quit . This job is like el calzn de una puta . A prostitute 's underwear . You heard me ! All day long it 's nothing but up and down , up and down , up and down . . .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
