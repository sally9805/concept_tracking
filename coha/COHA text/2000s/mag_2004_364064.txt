Most of America is sleeping , but deep within CIA headquarters in northern Virginia , officials pulling overnight duty are scarfing junk food , soft drinks and coffee as they surf mountains of intelligence reports for the latest potential threat to Americans . These are the men and women of the year-old Terrorist Threat Integration Center ( TTIC ) . As they sit at gray , modular workstations equipped with secure computer terminals and phones , their toil is long and arduous but never dull . " It 's day right now in half the world , so this shift 's pretty fast paced , " says an official . " In another hour , it 's morning prayers in East Africa . It 's morning already in Kabul . " <P> In an unprecedented tour of TTIC 's interim quarters as well as the CIA 's Counterterrorist Center and the pipeline that leads to the site of President Bush 's top-secret daily intelligence briefings , TIME correspondents got an inside look at the nerve center of America 's efforts against terrorism . The atmosphere was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes by without any potentially alarming intelligence reports coming in , an official replies , " I have n't had a night like that . There 's always something . " <P> Each day , officials at TTIC ( pronounced tee-tic ) examine 5,000 to 6,000 pieces of intelligence , trying to assemble the best picture of what 's out there . Staffed by representatives of about a dozen government entities , TTIC strives to address the failure of agencies to share vital intelligence before 9/11 . " We have an FBI analyst who 's sitting next to a CIA analyst who 's sitting next to a Secret Service analyst who 's sitting next to a Coast Guard analyst , " says TTIC chief John Brennan , a senior CIA officer . " They take information from their different systems and say , ' Hey , have you seen this ? ' or ' Is this something that affects what you 're doing now ? ' " <P> Brennan insists TTIC does n't run spy operations inside the U.S. , which the CIA is prohibited from doing . But , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FBI to do so to fill " gaps in our knowledge . " The center is helping to monitor " a lot of folks who have acquired U.S. citizenship or green cards that are engaged in international terrorism , " says Brennan . A well-placed source says the FBI now keeps tabs on about 400 individuals in the U.S. who are thought to be sympathetic to al-Qaeda or somehow connected to Sunni extremism . The FBI has also tried to co-opt some of them as informants . <P> Toward midnight , in an interview in a nondescript office in the Counterterrorist Center , a senior official describes a mission that is much closer to the Hollywood image of spy work : intense , often risky covert action against terrorists abroad . " Our job is to capture them and kill them , " the official says . That means , he explains , taking action " at the direction of the President , by formal decree , clandestinely . Sometimes you 're acting at his direction to change the world . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
