H. J. Heinz Shareholders have waited all too long for William Johnson to fix the focus at Heinz . He promises one saucy turnaround . <p> WILLIAM JOHNSON , THE sixth chief executive in the 136-year history of ketchup king H.J. Heinz , loves to toss around sports clichs , spicing his speech with quips from college football legend Paul ( Bear ) Bryant , Yankees manager Joe Torre and UCLA basketball coach John Wooden . His favorite , from a book by Wooden : " Although there is no progress without change , not all change is progress . " <p> Since taking over in 1998 , Johnson , 56 , has made a lot of changes at Heinz  --  but very little progress . Heinz 's stock price has gone nowhere since 2000 ; its net income has yo-yoed wildly in that time , and it fell 7% last year . Sales growth has crept along at 1.3% a year since 2002 , by some estimates , after stripping out acquisitions and currency benefits . <p> " It has been nothing but one disappointment after another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which owns 90,000 Heinz shares . Nine of the 14 sell-side analysts who follow Heinz give it a lukewarm " hold " or an outright " sell " rating . One big institutional holder , Deutsche Bank , cut its position in Heinz by 12 million shares , 80% of its holdings . <p> But Johnson says Heinz is on the mend with a sharpened focus on its staple : ketchup  --  " the soul of the company , " he says  --  and condiments and sauces . He is shedding other operations to buy local ketchup and sauce brands in Russia , the U.K. and elsewhere . And Johnson wants to get consumers in North America to slather ketchup far beyond the burger . <p> This amounts to playing catch-up in ketchup . But the tomatoey standby actually continues to enjoy mass appeal , even as a nation of beef-eaters turned to chicken , fish and the ubiquitous wrap . It survived exaggerated reports of its demise at the hands of its sexier doppelgnger : salsa . ( In the U.S. 10 billion ounces of ketchup are sold each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he uses ketchup on nearly everything he eats , making ketchup sandwiches and pouring the stuff on mashed potatoes , broccoli and even his wife 's Thanksgiving turkey . ( It took a while , but she finally got used to this . ) <p> " In Sweden people put ketchup on their pasta . And in Russia they put it on their eggs , " he says with an earnest hopefulness . In the U.S. , by contrast , only 4% of people use ketchup on their eggs . Heinz is waging a new ad blitz urging people to add it to meatloaf and is encouraging its food-service partners , like Chili 's , to use it in recipes for fish and chicken . The company wants Americans to lust after ketchup so much that they will buy it in one of the bulky 64-ounce bottles insiders have nicknamed " the Hummer , " which will debut next year . <p> Heinz has made a barely noticed but remarkable leap in its share of the North American ketchup market , from 47% to 60% since Johnson took charge in 1998 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress owes mainly to product innovations like colored ketchups ( purple , pink , blue ) and plastic squeeze bottles ( see Heinz 's Hallmarks ) . <p> To get back to basics , Heinz is undergoing a sweeping restructuring  --  its third in six years  --  this one aimed at stripping Heinz of businesses with $1.5 billion in annual sales ( 17% of total revenue ) . In two previous overhauls Heinz took a total of $1 billion in aftertax charges to shed such unwanted distractions as Weight Watchers . The latest plan , unwrapped in September , will spark a $100 million charge in the next year . <p> But this face-lift could set up a prettier , slimmed-down Heinz for an outright sale to a supergiant such as Kraft Foods , with annual sales of $32 billion , or , say , Unilever , with $52 billion . Heinz is a bantamweight at less than $9 billion , but it has great brands like Ore-Ida potatoes and Classico pasta sauces . With a market cap of $12billion , it is valued at 18 times what it earned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 29 times earnings . <p> Johnson does n't fret over such matters . " We have to be the best we can be and let everything else fall out as it may , " he says , sounding like a coach . But he knows he is living his own sports clich : fourth and long , bottom of the ninth , one last shot at the buzzer . ( Business writers love sports clichs , too . ) " I bet my career every day I come to work , " he says , " and I 'm betting that this plan fundamentally finishes the transformation of the company with the goal of making cooking less onerous . He first bottled horseradish , then ketchup in 1876 . Family members lorded over the company for three generations and 118 years , until Johnson 's celebrated predecessor , Anthony O'Reilly , added the chairman title in 1987 , eight years after he became chief executive . <p> O'Reilly expanded Heinz from 22 countries to 39 and made some 40 acquisitions at a total cost of $3.6billion . He ventured far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in South Korea and fashion eyewear in Italy . Under O'Reilly , Heinz 's market cap rose from $900 million in 1979 to $15 billion in 1998 , one and a half times the growth of the Dow for the same period . Total revenue grew a compound 7.2%per year , as net rose 11% . <p> And the Irish O'Reilly , a former rugby player , did it with panache . He hosted lavish parties at his mansion in Ireland . He supported the arts and dallied in a few side businesses ; he 's still the largest shareholder of Independent News &; Media , a leading Irish newspaper company . His lower-key successor lacks O'Reilly 's flair . When O'Reilly went out , he " would only go to the white-tablecloth places , " says Michael Milone , a 25-year veteran who runs most of Heinz 's global operation . " If Bill Johnson was going out to check on our products , he 'd eat at a fast-food restaurant . " O'Reilly rode to on-site visits in a limo ; Johnson rides shotgun in a delivery van . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a coach for pro football 's Cincinnati Bengals . " It 's a very black-and-white existence when you grow up in a coach 's family . You either won or you lost , " Johnson says . His stomach got queasy before every one of his dad 's games . <p> The son never played football ( " I did n't want to be compared to my dad " ) and instead studied political science at UCLA and got an M.B.A . at the University of Texas . He joined Heinz at age 33 in 1982 as a marketing manager for new business . <p> In 1987 O'Reilly tapped him to run the troubled pet division , whose share of cat food , once 45% , tumbled all the way to 15% . " I felt like I was being sent to Siberia , " he says . He fired management , cut costs to accommodate a price-obsessed market and increased profits from $55 million to $230 million in seven years . Cat food share recovered to 28% . <p> That turnaround earned Johnson a promotion to president in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson two years later , Heinz was an unfocused mishmash . Lame brands were allowed to fester on shelves , and each country manager was buying his own size bottle of ketchup . <p> Johnson set out to fix things , uncomfortable that his mentor stayed on as a nonexecutive chairman for two and a half years , still attending every board meeting . " It was unpleasant at times , " says Johnson , " and it slowed down the decision-making process . " <p> O'Reilly declined to comment on the handoff of power but emphasizes that he is still a major shareholder and says , " I have complete confidence in Bill as CEO . " <p> In 1999 Johnson launched " Operation Excel , " shutting down 20 factories and selling the Weight Watchers business to better focus on foodstuffs  --  ketchups , condiments , sauces , canned tuna and jarred and frozen vegetables . Johnson cut the number of SKUs ( stock-keeping units ) worldwide from 36,000 to 16,000 . More slimming-down came in 2002 , when Johnson spun off his old pet food business ( 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , infant foods and store-brand soups into a new company and handed it to Del Monte . <p> But Wall Street yawned , and the stock pretty much went nowhere . " It 's a shell game , " says Leach of Neuberger Berman . " They restate earnings downward . Then when they grow back to where they were , they pretend it 's progress . But it 's not . " <p> Johnson insists his latest renovation will set Heinz right . Europe in particular needed fixing . Private-label pressure , from Tesco in vegetables and ASDA in tuna , has eaten into Heinz 's profits in these categories , where consumers shop on price . " We ca n't command the premium in these categories that we do in ketchups , " says Joseph Jimenez , who heads Heinz Europe . <p> So Heinz is dumping those businesses . In October it sold its European prepared- vegetable group to NPM , a Dutch private equity group . Next up : the European frozen-food and tuna businesses and Tegel , a New Zealand poultry producer . All told , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue to 8% by 2008 , and sales outside the U.S. , now at 60% of Heinz 's total , will be halved ; North American sales will make up 50% , up from 42% . <p> The sales will free time and resources to pursue Heinz 's strengths . In May the company bought a majority stake in Petrosoyuz , the second-largest maker of ketchup in Russia . Johnson hopes to win big business from McDonald 's outlets there , where ketchup is more tomatoey and less spicy . Around the world , in fact , local versions of ketchup are generally sweeter than in the U.S. , where Americans like it tart ; in the Philippines Heinz makes ketchup from bananas . ( It 's still red , though . ) <p> In August Heinz made the largest acquisition in its history , paying $820 million for HP , the British maker of Lea &; Perrin 's Worcestershire sauce , in a kind of cocktail-sauce-synergy . In India Heinz is introducing what it says is the first nationwide line of commercial chutneys . <p> Back home in Pittsburgh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Innovation Center , just north of the city in Marshall Township , Pa . There a hundred food scientists watch consumers trying new products through two-way mirrors ; they also isolate food pathogens in a microbiology lab and drop and shake boxes of bottles to find ways to cut down on shipping breakage rates . A testing room uses lights that render food samples monochromatic so testers concentrate only on taste . <p> Researchers also work on refining the breeding , processing and taste of the all-important tomato . New seed hybrids will produce fruit redder in color and higher in sugar and lycopene , an antioxidant that may prevent prostate cancer . They try cooking ketchups in different ways , using dry spice blends or oil-based ones . " Very few people are allowed to know the exact recipe , " says the chief technical officer , Kerr Dow . <p> Ketchup ignites the palate as one of the few foods to stimulate all five sensations inside the mouth : salty , sweet , sour , bitter and umami , the latter of which gives body to food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's inexpensive , thus easily mass-marketed , and is controlled by the food eater , not the food preparer . Not bad for a condiment that was originally used to mask rotting food . <p> But can a company thrive on an all-ketchup diet ? The company 's single largest shareholder , Capital Research &; Management , with 52 million shares , recently added 3 million more . " We 're playing to our strengths , like the Steelers do with their defense , " Johnson says , reverting to SportsCenter mode . " The return will come .
