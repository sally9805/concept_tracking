Harriet Cleve Dufresnes , the 12-year-old heroine of Donna Tartt 's The Little Friend , is a bookish girl in small-town Mississippi in the early ' 70s . So was Tartt . Harriet has dark bobbed hair and an intense stare that unnerves other children and even grownups . Look at Tartt 's photo , and compare for yourself . And  --  not unlike an author gestating a Gothic suspense novel  --  Harriet is patiently hatching a terrible and ominous plan . <P> For Tartt , " patiently " is the operative word . As the precocious 28-year-old author of 1992 's The Secret History , about a murder by a clique of college intellectuals , she won rave reviews , media adulation and a welcome-wagon of advance and movie-rights money . Then she withdrew to complete a novel that was to be finished in a few years , then a few more years . The lit-world gossips nattered : Was she a one-hit wonder ? In hiding ? Sophomore-slumped ? <P> If so , every sophomore should slump this well . The Little Friend ( Knopf ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with few wasted words , told in a rich , controlled voice that can come only from long effort , which does n't show ostentatiously on the page . Like History , it 's a murder mystery in which the mystery is secondary . Twelve years before the novel begins , Harriet 's 9-year-old brother Robin was found hanged in the backyard . Harriet 's family  --  social pillars who have lost their wealth but not their hauteur  --  have not healed well . Her father has abandoned the family ; her mother has checked out emotionally , leaving Harriet 's rearing to the maid and the Alexandria , Miss. , library , whose blackhearted adventure tales  --  Stevenson 's pirates , Kipling 's cobras  --  she reads greedily . She also loves Bible stories , for their morbid , operatic horror ; in her yard , she stages Passion plays , in which she stars as Jesus , serving Ritz crackers and grape Fanta as the Last Supper and acting out Christ 's capture at Gethsemane beneath the tree where Robin was hanged . <P> Robin hovers over Harriet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an anvil : a stained-glass window in their church , dedicated to him , depicts Jesus talking to " a red-haired boy in a baseball cap who bore an unmistakable resemblance to Robin . " One summer , Harriet sets out to " solve " his murder . She concludes  --  through an arbitrary and disastrous hunch  --  that he was hanged by his playmate Danny Ratliff , now 20 , a drug dealer from a trailer-trash family . The penalty : she will kill Danny by getting a poisonous snake to bite him .
