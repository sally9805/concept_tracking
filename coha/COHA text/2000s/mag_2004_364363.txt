Sometimes Steve Jobs is wrong . When he launched Apple Computer 's iTunes Music Store in April 2003 , for instance , he predicted it would sell 100 million songs within a year . As of last month , a little more than 50 million 99 songs had been downloaded . Sometimes wrong is right enough , though . " I 'm thrilled , " he says . " It 's been a great year . " For a man whose marketing prowess is almost as brilliant as his imprint on the computer age , " great " is an understatement . His iTunes-to-iPod music strategy suggests a way to save the free-falling , Napster-knackered music industry . Pixar , his computer-animation studio , won another Academy Award this year , for Finding Nemo . But Jobs ' major coup has been his reinvention of the venerable Apple Computer . <P> Nearly half the M players out there are Apple iPods , more than 2.5 million have been sold so far , and iTunes controls 70% of the music-download business . " I think you 're seeing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing can do when we do n't have  --  " Jobs says , pausing for a beat , " that operating-system feeling . " <P> Ah , that . Apple 's " operating-system feeling " is a delicate way to refer to the firm 's long decline in market share . Fewer than 3% of the world 's computer users now have a Mac . The true significance of Jobs ' music play was that it allowed the company to get away from the computer wars and find new markets . <P> In Silicon Valley , being wrong is a common side effect of being innovative . Jobs has been synonymous with the kind of ingenuity that 's at the forefront of the tech industry . Everything his company does is scrutinized , often imitated and sometimes even stolen by competitors . ( Windows is the most notable example of the highest form of flattery ; Wal-Mart 's launch of a download-music site is the most recent . ) The mouse , how your computer 's desktop acts when you point and click at folders and files , wireless Net connectivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the things that Jobs was the first to get right for a mass market . He baked them into his Macs , which forced the PC world to follow along . What 's next ? Jobs will say only , " What drives us is delighting customers . " He 's definitely right about that .  --  BY JOSH QUITTNER , editor , Business 2.0
