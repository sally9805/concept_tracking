Section : PEOPLE FILE Master horologist John Metcalfe keeps on ticking <p> ON SEPTEMBER 11 , 2001 , an Associated Press photographer captured stunned Wall Street workers witnessing the collapse of the south tower of the World Trade Center . It is a moment in time , 9:59 a.m. , and one of utter panic ; most of those in the photograph are running for their lives . One man , however , does n't move . He is John Metcalfe , who owns a tiny clock-repair shop around the corner from the trade center , on Beekman Street . He continues to look up at history unraveling before his eyes . <p> Sitting in a caf a block from the sorrowful pit that is the twin towers site today , Metcalfe recalled that terrible moment . " One minute we could see the fires glowing deep within the building and great sheets of its skin peeling away and drifting down to earth like autumn leaves , " he said . " Then the tower seemed to fall everywhere and nowhere at once and disappear into dust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock restoration , would be idling in New York City 's financial district that morning amid thousands of notoriously time-urgent money-changers might strike some as odd , unless they take the long view . " There was a period a couple of hundred years ago when clock-repair shops were everywhere in Lower Manhattan , " Metcalfe said . " They serviced the chronometers aboard sailing ships docked in New York . I 'm simply here where it all started . " <p> Metcalfe has been one of New York 's premier clock mechanics for the past 11 of his 48 years . His fascination with timepieces  --  technically , a timepiece tells time , a clock strikes a bell or a chime  --  began when , as a 10-year-old boy , he unearthed a busted alarm clock in his grandmother 's garden shed in North London . He took it apart and inside found his life 's calling . He received a technical degree in clock repair , did a stint at the British Museum 's Ilbert Collection in the Department of Medieval and Later Antiquities and taught clock repair at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I dismantled it down to its smallest component , and the student would spend the semester putting it back together . " <p> Eleven years ago he decided to hang a shingle in Manhattan , a city long on exquisite timepieces and short on people who know the oddball mechanics of how they work . Today , collectors and institutions such as New York 's Metropolitan Museum of Art bring Metcalfe their rarest treasures . He disassembles each one at an elf 's workbench using age-old hand tools  --  a bow-driven drill ; delicate tweezers  --  while scores of clocks around the room chime the passing hours and the mighty computers of the world 's financial giants whir in the tall buildings outside . <p> Standing at one of the bookshelves in his cluttered sixth-floor workshop , called Antiquarian Horologist , Metcalfe smiled and lightly tapped the side of a small ornate table clock . " This one is making a fuss just now , " he said . " French , 1820s . Quite a gothic confection . " He is youthful and small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the hottest days , he has the look of a Victorian poet . <p> He moved around the high-ceilinged room , its floor creaking , and stopped at a clock hanging on the wall . It was round with a long-stemmed case housing a pendulum . " This is a banjo clock . American . Mass-produced , 1890s . Cheap and cheerful . Stops mysteriously at 20 past . " Across the way was a German clock missing its bell and hands . " This one dates to 1550 , " he said . " It 's a wonder it 's survived . " Just then , bells and chimes all around the work- shop lightly marked the quarter-hour . Ting ting ting . Clang clang . Ding ding cling . <p> " You know , there 's really very little new in clocks , " Metcalfe went on . Ping ping ping . " For example , you know that clock they sell at Kmart that displays the time on the ceiling of your bedroom ? That 's an Italian Renaissance idea ! It had an oil lamp inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As social critic Lewis Mumford noted in a 1934 essay , " The Monastery and the Clock , " humankind hummed along for eons allowing the seasons to mark time . He speculated that it was n't until the seventh century , when Pope Sabinianus decreed that monks observe seven periods of daily prayers , that the imperative arose to keep track of the hours . By the 13th century , the tyrannical mechanical clock was synchronizing humanity 's deeds . Centuries later , the day was further broken down into minutes , minutes into seconds . " Time-keeping passed into time-serving and time-accounting and time-rationing , " Mumford wrote . " Eternity ceased gradually to serve as the measure and focus of human actions . " <p> Time , German philosopher Immanuel Kant observed , is a " subjective condition . " One ca n't see it or touch it , yet it exists . What was needed was a device to accurately measure it . <p> " That 's where the portable coil spring came in , the real breakthrough , " Metcalfe said , pawing through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the energy The trick was to wind up the spring and then allow the energy to escape little by little in tiny increments over the course of a day or a week , by means of a device called an ' escapement , ' a mechanism that interrupts the turning of the clock 's wheels at regular intervals . That 's the ticktock ticktock sound . The Germans , the French , the Italians , the Dutch , the Americans , the British each developed their own idiosyncratic way  --  sometimes breathtakingly simple , sometimes needlessly complex  --  of doing the same thing . But the source behind the spring is always the same . It 's you ! You had to remember to wind the clock . " <p> Some came to view clocks as art , others as science , but everybody claimed them as status symbols . " By the Renaissance you begin to see portraits where a clock appears behind the subject , " Metcalfe said . " It was a memento mori and a way of showing off that time meant something to you and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calendar like some peasant . " <p> And entire towns wanted the glory . " Every village longed for a clock in the town square , " said Metcalfe , opening his arms to the tall windows in his workshop . " It made a statement to visitors about what a sophisticated place they were entering . " By the early Renaissance , particularly in the Low Countries , clocks were designed with tubular bells and glass windows and mechanical figures popping out of trapdoors . " Keeping time became almost secondary to the amusement . " <p> And someone had to keep them all running . Until the installation of an electric winch in 1912 , at least two men worked five to six hours three times a week to wind London 's Big Ben . " That 's a huge responsibility , " said Metcalfe . Which is why , he said , he turned down the offer several years ago to become Clock Master of the City of New York , a job that demands making sure that municipal clock towers in neighborhoods like Bowling Green and City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It 's one thing to forget to wind your watch , but to keep time for everybody else ? No thanks . Besides , I 'm not keen on heights . Or pigeon guano . " <p> Small antique clocks provide just the right scale for Metcalfe , and the job of mending them comes with responsibility enough . " When people hand me their clocks , " he said , " many of them plead , ' Please look after my baby . ' " Which is why , in the week following 9/11 , he paced the police line waiting to get back into his workshop . How had one and a half million tons of debris falling two short blocks away affected all those babies in his care ? <p> " When I finally got back into my shop , the windows were closed , but still , a fine layer of dust  --  what I 've come to think of as ' finely ground zero '  --  covered everything in a ghostly kind of way , " said Metcalfe , standing at a sunlit window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street , tourists studied maps in their quest for the Five Points , the Lower East Side Tenement Museum , the old Fraunces Tavern where Gen. George Washington , departing for a short-lived private life , bade farewell to his officers on December 4 , 1783 . <p> And the clocks  --  were they all running ? " Oh yes , " he said . " Some were even running that were n't working when I left . People often come to me with a clock that has n't worked for years , and by the time they arrive at my door it 's ticking . Why ? Because the jolt of the cab ride has unstuck an old spring . On September 11 , the clocks in here felt the crash of the falling buildings . And they came to life .
