<p> PALISADE - Good prospects for this year 's grape crop are tantalizing wine producers here . <p> But in the nascent Colorado industry , net income is as rare as a humble wine critic . <p> The old joke applies : How to retire with $ 1 million in the wine biz ? Start with $ 2 million . <p> The business is driven by enthusiasts whose zeal for wine outpaces their thirst for cash . Starting a modest winery costs at least $ 175,000 , according to one industry study . <p> The hard work and uncertain returns are suggested in grape grower Kenn Dunn 's sunburned neck , baked by dozens of hours spent pruning his rows of vines . <p> The spiritual reward is found in the sparkle of his eyes as he talks about last year 's syrah vintage , the best he has ever made . <p> The dirt below Dunn 's vines yields slightly under his dusty white sneakers - a sign that winter moisture has graced Grand Valley 's vineyards . <p> A string of winter snowfalls on the Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in several years . Although freezes in November and January damaged some vines , Dunn is optimistic . <p> Married with three children , Dunn was a Houston-based field service electrical engineer . A native of Durango , he moved back to Colorado in 1994 . He began planting his 4 1/2 acres of grapes in 1995 on the verdant East Orchard Mesa southeast of Grand Junction . <p> Like many of Colorado 's grape growers and winemakers , Dunn began as a hobbyist . He had sought to buy some grapes to make a batch of homemade wine , but found virtually no sellers . All of Colorado 's grapes were going to commercial wineries . <p> ' I figured if it was so hard to find grapes , I would grow some for me and the other home winemakers , ' said Dunn , a husky 47-year-old who prowls his vineyards in an Australian bush hat with pruning shears holstered on his belt . <p> Dunn 's grape production grew , and he soon began selling to Grand Valley wineries . <p> On the winemaking side , his progression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quirk of fate . <p> Two days before he was to sell 4 tons of his 2001 grape harvest to a winery , the buyer backed out of the deal , leaving Dunn with no choice but to press the grapes himself . <p> He sold 1,100 cases of his Hermosa Vineyards wine last year to Western Slope restaurants and liquor stores , making him typical of a new entrant into the Colorado wine business - small , enthusiastic about wine , and trying to master the tenuous economics of winemaking . <p> ' I ca n't think of anybody who got into this business to make a living , ' said Ron Binz , a former home winemaker who invested a year 's salary to start Trail Ridge Winery in Loveland . <p> Trail Ridge buys grapes such as gewurztraminer , riesling and chardonnay from Western Slope vineyards , then makes the wine in Loveland . <p> A former director of the Colorado Office of Consumer Counsel and now a utilities consultant , Binz has not given up his day job to make wine . <p> But his heart is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1993 . <p> Startup wineries almost always operate at a loss for several years . <p> A University of Arkansas study shows that building a winery that produces 5,000 gallons costs at least $ 175,000 , apart from buying or growing the grapes . A larger-scale winery of 20,000 gallons would cost $ 630,000 , according to the study . <p> Even established wineries like Trail Ridge are n't assured of profits . <p> ' It 's nip and tuck for us year to year , ' Binz said . ' You ca n't be too hard-core about profitability in this industry . It 's a labor of love . That 's not to say you ca n't be profitable , but it 's a tough go . ' <p> Vineyard owners are capitalizing on the fast-growing industry 's hunger for grapes - as long as they do n't get wiped out by a late spring freeze , drought or the vexatious grape mealybug . <p> But if ever there was a recent year pointing toward a bumper crop in Colorado , this could be it . If the September harvest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home among the state 's wineries . Colorado added 10 new wineries last year , making it one of the fastest-growing winery states in the nation . <p> Collectively , Colorado 's 50 wineries are beginning to show some economic muscle . <p> Wineries have become Mesa County 's top tourist attraction . Vintners sold $ 6.7 million of Colorado wines last year . The grape harvest was valued at about $ 2 million . <p> ' You hear from Colorado that it seems to be working there , it 's exciting , and it 's going places , ' said Bill Nelson , vice president of Washington , D.C.-based industry group WineAmerica . <p> California , it is not . Nor Washington or Oregon . Even relatively obscure winemaking states such as Arkansas , Kentucky and Ohio outpace Colorado 's wine production . <p> But steady growth is moving the Colorado wine industry from a novelty to a noticeable sector in the Colorado economy - and from an unknown on the national wine scene to a mid-tier player . <p> ' My sense is ( Colorado ) could become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a niche somewhere below secondary wine producers such as Idaho , Missouri , Virginia and Pennsylvania . <p> ' It 's a tough business ' <p> Industry experts such as Nelson say Colorado 's immediate goal should be to increase awareness of the state 's wines and stimulate sales among local residents . <p> The Colorado Wine Industry Development Board does marketing campaigns , distributes brochures and sponsors wine tastings around the state . The board 's $ 450,000 budget comes from a 5 cent-per-liter tax on sales of Colorado-made wine , plus 1 cent per liter on all wine sales , regardless of origin . <p> While the market penetration of Colorado wines has risen over the past decade , it still accounts for just one of every 100 bottles sold in the state . <p> Wine experts say western Colorado 's hot summer days and intense sunlight make grapes with strong flavors , yet the cool nights help preserve acids that give wines crispness and character . <p> The best of Colorado 's wines have fared well in national competitions . Over the past 10 years , Colorado wines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco International Wine Competition to the Colorado State Fair . <p> On the Western Slope - a region already well known for its high-quality peaches , cherries , pears and apples - grape vines are being planted at a faster pace than any other fruit . Grapes can yield average revenue of about $ 4,000 per acre . That 's on a par with peaches , yet with lower production costs than peaches or most other orchard fruits . <p> Several Mesa County growers , including industry leader Talbott Farms , have uprooted low-profit apple trees in favor of newly planted vines , even though the grapes do n't reach full production until five years after planting . <p> Vines are being grown on 650 acres in Colorado - a tiny fraction of the state 's agricultural land - but an increase of about 50 percent from three years ago . Unlike the profit potential of growing grapes , producing wine is an iffier proposition , subject to the whims of consumer preference and the ever-changing mysteries of fermentation . <p> Steve Smith , president of Grande River Vineyards in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry . <p> He 's among the biggest grape growers in the state and one of the leading wine producers . His well-situated tasting room on a prime Interstate 70 interchange attracts up to 20,000 visitors - and potential wine buyers - a year . <p> Selling wine from a tasting room at full retail price - ranging from $ 8 to $ 19 a bottle at Grande River Vineyards - is a decided advantage compared with lower margins from selling wholesale through distributors , as many wineries do . <p> But even after 13 years in business , Smith is never assured of making money . <p> ' We turned our first profit in 1995 , ' he said . ' Since then , some years yes , some no . ' <p> Like other winemakers and many businesses , he faces a conundrum . He could keep the winery the same size . Or , he could risk investing more in equipment and labor , produce more wine , increase sales and get the benefits of economies of scale . <p> Smith is mulling his options . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes to expand their small , home-based winemaking into a fledgling commercial winery . <p> Nancy Janes and John Behrs were software engineers in Boulder before succumbing to the grape bug in 1998 . <p> They invested their savings in 20 acres of East Orchard Mesa grapevines in 1998 and now produce six grape varieties - cabernet sauvignon , chardonnay , merlot , cabernet franc , muscat blanc and syrah . <p> While Janes and Behrs see the winery as an opportunity to supplement income from grape growing , they have n't let wine 's romanticism blind them to economic reality . <p> " This is a lifestyle thing for many people , " Janes said . " But it 's a tough business . It 's always going to be a horse race . "
