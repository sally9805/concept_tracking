<p> The mantel of heroism is a transitory thing in today 's NFL , a week-to-week deal at best , and the 49ers this morning can only ponder a 20-14 loss to nemesis Green Bay as the latest example of that self-evident truth . <p> They could have , in a better world , pulled past the Packers in the waning seconds on Sunday at Candlestick Park . In that better world , quarterback Jeff Garcia would have capped an impressive last-minute drive with the glory of the winning touchdown , spreading joy and confidence to an organization that wants to believe it has big things in its future . <p> Instead , the real world , muddier and less pretty , beckoned . <p> Last week 's gleeful escape at Dallas , a game that spoke to this team at its best in the clutch , into this week 's disappointing flutter . After driving the 49ers from their own 26 to the Green Bay 14-yard line in the final moments , after trying to make something sunny and pretty on a gray and gusty and wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three tries to move forward , Garcia on 4th-and-7 from the 11 felt heat in the pocket , stepped up quickly and threw a feckless incompletion , intended for tight end Eric Johnson . The ball lay on the damp grass , seemingly miles from the end zone , and the 49ers could only wonder : What now ? <p> " We 're in the playoffs , " said receiver Terrell Owens , one of the more upbeat voices in the locker room . " We lost , but it 's not the end of the world . " <p> Countered Garcia , whose bid to outduel Packers great Brett Favre ended with that foul taste : " We did n't take advantage , and we let one slip away . " <p> What now ? <p> There are , apparently , a few ways to ponder that question . The reality is this : The 49ers ( 9-5 ) lost a previously remote chance to get a first-round bye in the playoffs , and now will host a wild-card game on Jan. 5 . This means they have essentially two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> From this Green Bay game , like from the 49ers ' season at large , there are signs of both good and bad : On the one hand , the 49ers ' battered defense held Favre out of the end zone in the fourth quarter , twice forcing field-goal attempts . On the other hand , the 49ers ' defense surrendered two lightning-quick Favre touchdown drives in the third quarter , turning a 6-3 halftime lead into a 17-6 Packers lead . <p> On the one hand , the 49ers ' offense failed to take advantage of a poor Green Bay run defense , rushing Garrison Hearst and Kevan Barlow just 18 times for 75 yards . On the other hand , the 49ers ' offense was able to strike , as when Garcia spotted a rare moment where Owens was left in man coverage . <p> Through the falling rain , Garcia lofted a pass downfield , and Owens hauled it in with Packers corner Mike McKenzie on his back . There , Owens did what he does so well , churning and running and not stopping , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when McKenzie tried to wrestle him down . Owens stormed into the end zone with a 45-yard score to make it 17-12 , and before Garcia could sneak in for a 2-point conversion , Owens injected flair and life back into his team . <p> He spotted a Gold Rush cheerleader in the back of the end zone , ran up to the young woman , and took her gold pompons from her . There , in front of the cheerleaders and a poncho-wearing , roaring Candlestick crowd , Owens shimmied and swayed like a high-school cheerleader . It was uproarious stuff , and in such moments , Owens seemingly can turn momentum and energy . <p> " In my next life , " Owens said with a sly grin , " I want to be a cheerleader . " <p> By this point , the game had turned good . The first half , certainly , was not . Both teams played cautious zone defenses . Combined with the weather , it produced timid play , even from the swashbuckling Favre . Green Bay 's longest gain of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 8 yards . <p> The third quarter , then , would be where Favre left his mark . Disgusted with a lack of aggression , Favre made sure the Packers would play with moxie . A drive full of chunky gains ended with Ahman Green running in from 9 yards out , and Green Bay led 10-6 . More important , the Packers raised the stakes . <p> " At some point , " Favre said , " we had to take chances . " <p> Things seemed firmly Green Bay 's way when Garcia , pressured , then threw a bizarre interception off the back of guard Matt Willig . It popped in the air , and was snagged by Green Bay 's Vonnie Holliday , who lateraled to Na'il Diggs for a 33-yard return . Favre does not waste chances like these  --  he led the Packers 29 yards in six plays , finding Donald Driver when Driver sped past rookie corner Mike Rumph on a slant pass . Green Bay 17 , 49ers 6 . <p> It appeared certain the magnificent Favre would improve to a haunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 49ers in the second half  --  13 carries , 57 yards  --  the Packers would have the ball for over 36 minutes . Short passes , quick runs  --  the 49ers were watching Favre control things again . <p> " That quick passing game , teams do it because of our team speed , " safety Tony Parrish said . <p> Quick passing and ball control ; cautious zones on defense . It was a good game plan for Green Bay , and it would negate Owens , who caught seven balls for 30 yards outside of the big touchdown . <p> " Mostly , it was the coverage , two-deep zones , " said coach Steve Mariucci . " When they did blitz and jump us man-to-man , we scored . So teams shy away from that against us . " <p> Which brought the 49ers to the final drive . Down , 20-14 , with 4:41 left . Here it was : a chance for Garcia to mimic his Dallas brilliance , only against a much better team . A chance to take a pound of flesh from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As against Dallas , it required good decisions , and short gains . Garcia ran for 13 yards , and a Garcia-to-Johnson pass gained 14 yards and set up 1st-and-10 from the 14 . From there , it went like this : <p>  --  First down , Garcia scrambled right , had an open field , but tried a throw to Tai Streets in the corner of the end zone . Streets ' left foot was out-of-bounds . Garcia looked back with regret . " In retrospect , maybe I should have kept it and got 6 or 7 yards , " Garcia said . <p>  --  Second down , a draw play to Hearst . " The thinking being , " Garcia said , " with that zone coverage , and them protecting the goal line , we could squeeze one through . " Three yards when Diggs tackled him . <p>  --  Third down from the 11 . Garcia dropped back , but stepped up quickly and threw a pass into Willig 's back . " I felt pressure , " Garcia said . <p>  --  Fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dallas fresh , Green Bay double-teamed the receiver , and forced Garcia to look for Johnson . The 49ers had sent two receivers to the end zone , and two for a first down . Garcia stepped up , and felt heat . Incomplete . " Unfortunately , I felt pressure off my backside , " Garcia said . " It forced me to throw before I wanted to . " <p> Conclusions can be drawn in January . For now , count it as a third home loss of the season , and a fifth loss to a team with a winning record . With losses to NFC powers Philadelphia , New Orleans and now Green Bay , why should the 49ers believe they have something special inside of them ? <p> " Because , " Owens said , " once the playoffs start , it 's a whole new season . It 's anybody 's ballgame .
