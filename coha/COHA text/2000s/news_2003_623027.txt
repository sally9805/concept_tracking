<p> They shrug off their knapsacks , tuck skateboards under chairs and put cell phones on vibrate as they enter UC Berkeley 's Kroeber Hall at the dimming of the day . Pens and paper poised , students prepare to think deep thoughts and study the great minds of civilization for 90 intellectually taxing minutes . <p> Aristotle and Socrates . <p> Kant and Descartes . <p> Nietzsche and Sartre . <p> Homer and . . . Marge , Bart , Lisa and baby Maggie . <p> " The Simpsons , " believe it or not , now grace the syllabus of at least one course at Cal , one of the country 's most prestigious public universities , home to Nobel Prize winners , renowned scientists and more famous authors than there are hemp clothing sellers on Telegraph Avenue . <p> This two-unit course , called " Simpsons and Philosophy , " is part of the university 's De-Cal program , student-sponsored initiatives in cooperation with UC Berkeley faculty meant to " broaden the education , and the university experience , of all Cal students . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic highbrows out there . To quote that animated miscreant Bart Simpson , " Do n't have a cow , man ! " This actually is an academically rigorous class , not a dumbing down of either philosophy or " The Simpsons . " <p> What " The Simpsons , " which recently aired its 300th episode on Fox , represents is nothing less than a glimpse at the complex human condition , how we live now and make our way morally in an often confusing world . At least that 's the line you get from Tyler Shores , the English major and student instructor who developed the course after 14 years of avid " Simpsons " watching . <p> To Shores , the high jinks of this animated dysfunctional family and its friends and neighbors in fictional Springfield can serve as a lesson in relationships for us all . Even if you do n't hang out in coffeehouses , arguing the finer points of Hume and Barthes , Shores believes that students and  --  heck , even the common folk  --  can glean life lessons from a simple cartoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Shores said . " Students are able to develop their own De-Cal courses for real class credit , and I figured Berkeley students are smart and want something to pique their interest . But they also want something fun because they work so damn hard . So I put the two together . It 's a fun but challenging class . " <p> The germ of Shores ' brainstorm came in 2001 , after he thumbed through a thick paperback at the bookstore called " The Simpsons and Philosophy : The D'oh of Homer , " edited by William Irwin ( Open Court , $17.95 ) . It serves as the text for the class , and it answers all the burning questions , such as " Can Nietzsche 's rejection of traditional morality justify Bart 's bad behavior ? " ( Short answer : no . ) <p> Shores , who by his own count has watched " Simpsons " episodes 3,000 times , figured that this class might be popular , and his faculty sponsor , Chris Nealon , agreed . But he had no idea just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first night , 400 students crammed the lecture hall to vie for 100 spots . <p> Lest anyone think this is a course that academically challenged jocks seek for easy credits to stay eligible for football , Shores quizzed the students on ( a ) their knowledge of philosophic principles ; and ( b ) " The Simpsons . " The majority of those accepted were upperclassmen with majors ranging from philosophy to economics to English literature . <p> " Honestly , I definitely needed the two units  --  and it counts toward my major , " said Bryan Derballa , a third-year English major . " It 's interesting the connections they 're making between the Socratic method and , like , Ned Flanders . I do n't think it 's going to spoil the show for me . As an English major , I like to tear apart works I like and see what 's beneath them . " <p> " The Simpsons , " added classmate Jill Sederholm , has a message for us all . " It 's not just some dumb cartoon , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights dimmed , and you could hear the students fidget to get comfortable in wooden chairs bolted to the floor . The screen flickered and there , in its brilliant bouffant blueness , was Marge Simpson 's vertically hegemonic hairdo . <p> This was Episode 175 , titled " In Marge We Trust . " Marge , upset that her family grumbled about having to go to church ( Snoozing Homer : " I got a lot of work to do around the bed today " ) , volunteers to become the " Listen Lady " at church . Soon she has displaced the Rev. Lovejoy and is dispensing sage advice , saving marriages and solving family squabbles . <p> Then Marge gets a call from Ned Flanders , the Simpsons ' hyper-devout neighbor . <p> Ned : " I 'm in some hot soup here , Marge . Some teenagers are hanging out in front of the store . I think they could start slacking at any moment . " <p> Marge : " Ned , you do n't have to stand for that . You just march right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Ned : " Well , if you 're sure it 'll help . . . . " <p> It does not help . In fact , the slacker teens chase Flanders out of town . They strand him in the zoo with rabid baboons . Lovejoy , eventually , rescues him . When the lights come back up , Shores has struck a contemplative pose in front of the lectern . He sips from his Jamba Juice smoothie , then begins . <p> " So , what is moral goodness ? " Shores said . " That 's a pretty big question . Is it doing what 's right ? But right to whom ? What 's right ? You think , what 's the greatest good for the greatest number of people ? What are the guiding principles that determine how we act ? Let 's take a moment and ponder this . " <p> He bowed his head , slightly . Dead air filled the room . <p> " OK , " Shores resumed , " duty as ( Immanuel ) Kant described it is a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do to make yourself a good person . They can conflict . What you should do usually means subordinating personal desires . Good intentions is another thing Kant talks about . Must a good deed be intended for good to be perceived as such , and can something intended as evil have good results and be judged morally good ? <p> " I 'm thinking of the episode where Homer is at an auction place , right ? He places a bid under Flanders ' name for 20 bucks , and the bid actually turns out to be for a hundred-dollar bill . Homer intended to screw Flanders over , but it had good results . " <p> Some students in front anxiously scribbled down the anecdote . <p> " With the ' Listen Lady ' episode , " Shores continued , " we see what happens when Marge 's good intentions turn bad . Kant talks about a duty directed toward oneself and acting to help others . Marge acts out of this duality . How should something be judged if the intentions were good and the results bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A student in the front row , wearing a black Clash T-shirt , was called on . <p> " I think it still can be considered a good deed , " he said . " Marge did n't think the consequences would be bad , though she might have known these were not good kids . But she could n't have possibly known Flanders would be chased out of town . " <p> Another hand goes up . <p> " Remember that episode , " a young man added , " where Lisa cheats on the standardized test and gets an A+++ and it makes tons of money for the school so they could buy new equipment ? Was that morally bad or good ? " <p> He was interrupted by a woman from the back . <p> " You know , a democracy is theoretically the greatest good for the greatest number of people , " she said . " But there 's always going to be an underrepresented group hurt by any decision . " <p> Shores : " Yes , that brings in the Aristotelean question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p.m. rolls around , and it 's time for the students to grab their knapsacks and skateboards and go home to study or watch TV  --  or , in the case of students in English 198 , " Philosophy and the Simpson , " both . <p> " I asked one of Cal 's philosophy professors what he thought of our course , " Shores said , " and he said , ' I do n't know anything about " The Simpsons " and I do n't own a TV . ' I 'm , like , thinking , fine if you think you 're too good for ' The Simpsons . ' But do n't spoil it for us . " <p> " Men , though they look , fail to see what is well-being , what is the good in life . " <p> Aristotle <p> " I ca n't live a button-down life like you . I want it all ! The terrifying lows , the dizzying highs , the creamy middles ! " <p>  --  Homer Simpson . <p> " There are no facts , only interpretations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do it . No one saw me do it . There 's no way you can prove anything ! " <p>  --  Bart Simpson . <p> " Act in such a way that you treat humanity , whether in your own person or in the person of another , always at the same time as an end and never simply as a means . " <p>  --  Immanuel Kant <p> " If you raise three children who can knock out and hog-tie a perfect stranger , you must be doing something right .
