<p> At Ummangaliso ( " Miracle " ) Primary School , the oldest elementary school in Khayelitsha Township , more than 1,400 children play on the lone jungle gym during morning recess . Nearby , half a dozen women sit with large plastic buckets of sweets and soft drinks , waiting for those children with pocket money to spare . Many of the kids have already eaten the one meal of the day they can count on - the school 's standard-issue two slices of bread plus a protein shake . In the school 's 17 years of existence , burglars have stolen everything from bricks to toilet bowls , so a construction team is installing new security grids over the windows . Beyond them all , through the smoke of the squatter camps , stands Table Mountain . <p> Tuesday is Freedom Day in South Africa , honoring the first multiracial vote in 1994 . But a decade after the official end of apartheid , the legacy of the former regime 's racially based policies still looms large in the nation 's schools . <p> The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 distinct departments of education and creating a single nonracially based one - came in the early heady days of democracy . Their major goals were straightforward and attainable . They successfully excised the most blatant excesses of apartheid education by officially doing away with racially divided schools and a white-supremacist curriculum . <p> Yet 10 years later , there is still little racial mixing in South Africa 's schools , and a far more complex and fundamental problem endures : ensuring that blacks get access to equal academic opportunities . <p> Distribution of resources <p> " The overwhelming majority of resources were lavished on white students , " says Edward Fiske , co-author of " Elusive Equity : Education Reform in Post-Apartheid South Africa . " If the new government had tried to redistribute resources - a practical difficulty , since it 's not easy to split up a state-of-the-art science lab or a cricket field - Mr. Fiske says the spreading would be thin , because blacks are the overwhelming majority . " Their goal was an equitable system , but they did n't want to lose the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of South Africa 's schools , the racial demographics have n't changed at Ummangaliso in the past 10 years . It remains all black . <p> The schools that have experienced the most racial and cultural exchange are the formerly white ones , virtually all of which now enroll at least a handful of nonwhite students . <p> Virtually all black schools remain all black . Whites have n't voluntarily integrated them . Anthony Hess , principal of the formerly " colored " ( mixed-race ) Groenberg High School in Grabouw , a wealthy fruit-farming town east of Cape Town , does n't expect whites to be integrated . " Parents still see across racial lines , " says Mr. Hess . " There 's a stigma associated with being a colored school . " <p> Apartheid has left once-white schools with better facilities than black schools . For example , a school in Grabouw maintains its excellent sports facilities , while Groenberg has no playing fields . Hess hopes that offering subjects not taught in the town 's formerly white school might attract some white students , at least for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barrier to integration . In South Africa , public schools may levy whatever charge they want . " No school can deny students access for nonpayment , but schools can sue the parents , " says Helen Ladd , coauthor of " Elusive Equity . " " Schools serving middle-class kids can raise a lot more money than those in rural areas or townships . " <p> Pupils at Ummangaliso are asked to pay 30 rands ( $ 4.45 ) per year . When parents ca n't pay even this modest amount - and most ca n't - they tend to avoid any direct contact with the staff . <p> At Groenberg High , total student fees amount to 370,000 rands ( $ 55,000 ) per year , while the formerly white school in town rakes in 2 million rands ( $ 297,000 ) per year . The extra funds go toward hiring more teachers , buying new materials , and maintaining facilities . <p> If fees are an unofficial barrier , language is a real one . For decades , policy dictated that only the Afrikaans language could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 official languages as the medium of instruction . But in rural areas , learners may have to choose between studying in an unfamiliar language or not attending school at all . <p> Do you speak my language ? <p> In the trilingual Cape Town region , English now dominates as the lingua franca . At Groenberg , 150 of its 1,400 students are ethnically Xhosa . Although students may take Xhosa as a language elective , the native Xhosa speakers must take math , history , and science courses in Afrikaans . <p> At one time , South African teachers were required to use prescribed texts . Today there 's more freedom as to how to teach - but frequently there are n't enough books to go around . As a result , the photocopy machine is in high demand . <p> " Last year , I bought 80 boxes of paper , but we ran out , " says Ummangaliso 's principal , Mlungisi Siko . " This year , I bought a hundred , but I do n't know if it will last . " <p> Despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure in creating lessons that would not have been allowed a decade ago . Ms. Nkewaa says she likes " to take today 's newspaper and develop a lesson " for the life skills class she teaches . <p> Last week she asked students to find pictures of South African leaders to facilitate discussions of Freedom Day . <p> Ummangaliso has two computers to manage a student body of nearly 1,500 ( one was won in a contest last year ) . They must identify a dedicated room to receive a set of computers for student use . Yet classes are already oversubscribed , some with more than 60 students . Officially , classes should be capped at 40 , but the school is reluctant to turn away any learners for lack of space . <p> A focus on outcomes-based education ( OBE ) also arrived in South Africa with the end of apartheid in an effort to make classroom teaching more practical . Rather than lecturing on abstract topics ( such as the responsibilities of an accountant ) , teachers are now encouraged to set up groups with hands-on tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank ) . <p> Outcomes-based education <p> In the big picture , OBE is expected to prepare students better by forcing them to apply concepts rather than recite facts . It 's also linked to a gradual move toward continuous evaluation , rather than an all-or-nothing testing period at the end of the year . <p> But changing teaching methods has proven difficult . While the demand for nonracially based schools came from the bottom up , pedagogical decisions were mostly imposed from the top down . Most of South Africa 's teachers are themselves the products of apartheid education , and some are neither willing nor able to adapt to the new approaches . <p> There has , however , been one large gain for the nation 's post-apartheid schools , many South African teachers agree . They have a stability now that did n't exist before . Though student activism had been a cornerstone in the struggle against apartheid , boycotts led to many students failing to complete their education . <p> But today , principal Hess says , there 's been " no disruption at the schools since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa <p> ELGIN , SOUTH AFRICA - Ten years ago , while I was home in the United States studying for my last set of college exams , a revolution was taking place in South Africa . In April 1994 , I devoured the international section of the newspaper daily , hungry to get as much information as I could about the coming elections and the end of apartheid . <p> Fascinated , I clipped the sample ballot , which was a long list of candidates with both names and small photos . Presumably the pictures were for people who could n't read , but they helped me put a face to each name . Never before had I so badly wanted to be somewhere else . <p> In January , with a group of about 20 , I flew to Cape Town to teach school for a year . Many of the other volunteers were like me , recent graduates with little to no teaching experience , but a keen desire to witness - and perhaps even assist - in South Africa 's transformation . <p> My placement was teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural school for the children of farm laborers outside Cape Town . The families were all so-called " colored . " <p> Last Friday I returned to Glen Elgin Primary School . <p> The student body today is still almost all colored - there are no white students - although they are now joined by a few Xhosa-speaking African children . Afrikaans is still the primary language of instruction . <p> Of course , there have been some changes . The textbooks are new , as are most of the teachers . A 19th-century encyclopedia has been replaced with a computer . Tina du Toit , who attended the school herself and who now teaches fourth grade , is also now its acting principal . <p> But in so many ways , the transformation I came to South Africa to witness still seems far from complete . <p> It 's chilly in the mornings here . I huddle with some of the students on the cement stoop before their teachers arrive . They know that they have Tuesday off for Freedom Day . They think it has something to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says one - but they 're not exactly sure why . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
