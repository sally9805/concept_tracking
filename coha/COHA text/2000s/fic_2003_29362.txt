I do n't do bachelor parties . Wait , that sounds like I jump naked out of cakes . And who makes cakes that tall and skinny ? What I mean is , I do n't plan bachelor parties . Weddings , yes . Rehearsal dinners , of course . Bridesmaids ' luncheons , engagement cocktail parties , even the occasional charity gala , when business is slow . The business in question is " Made in Heaven Wedding Design , Carnegie Kincaid , Proprietor . " I 've got a pretty decent clientele in Seattle by now , and sometimes I accept non-nuptial referrals . But I do n't do bachelor parties , for two very good reasons . First off , I resent the symbolism , the whole bit about the doomed groom 's last spasm of freedom before he turns himself in at the matrimonial slammer . I 'm in favor of matrimony , after all . I might even try it myself someday . But that 's another story . The second and more compelling reason is that no event planner in her right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on drinking themselves into oblivion , and behaving as poorly as possible en route . The potential for disaster is huge . So why , at ten p.m. on the twelfth of December , was I standing out in the freezing night wind , hammering on a locked door behind which lurked a gang of undoubtedly drunken bachelors ? Because of Sally " Bridezilla " Tyler . I had inherited Sally 's New Year 's Eve wedding from Dorothy Fenner , my longtime , more-or-less friendly competitor in the Seattle bride biz , when Dorothy 's fuddy-duddy husband purchased two tickets on a world cruise and a prescription for Viagra . I appreciated her vote of confidence -- let 's face it , I desperately needed the revenue -- but it wasturning out to be hard-earned . This particular bride , besides being lovely and wealthy , was a control freak of the first order . Most brides are content to let the best man handle the bachelor party , but not Sally Tyler , oohh no . She supposedly wanted me to plan this one so that my valuable services could be her wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say besotted ) fiance . But I saw through that little fiction . What Sally really craved was more scope to contradict , criticize , and generally micromanage Frank 's every waking moment . Though why she thought my involvement would prevent Jason Kraye , the know-it-all best man , from pouring too much booze , or showing porno movies , or doing anything else he pleased , was beyond me . I 'm a wedding planner , not a governess for overgrown boys . Anyway , I declined Sally 's request , she fumed , and tensions mounted . And then Jason Kraye broke the deadlock by coming up with the perfect party site : the Hot Spot Cafe on the south side of the Seattle Ship Canal , owned by a buddy of his and closing soon for a major remodel . Said buddy was offering use of the Cafe for free . The guests could do their worst , with Jason as master of ceremonies , and I could steer clear . The only catch was that the party had to happen ASAP , on a Sunday night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment that anyone who could n't skip work Monday could just sleep it off on company time . He promised Frank a memorable blowout ; Frank loved the idea , and that was that . I even made peace with Sally by arranging for the food : a bachelors ' banquet of serve-yourself Greek appetizers , catered by my friend and colleague Joe Solveto . But I stipulated that I personally would not be visiting the party premises . Frank thanked his bride for her generous gift , and everybody was happy . Until now . I 'd been working late the night of Frank 's bachelor party , at my borrowed desk in Joe 's catering office , when my cell phone sounded . " Carnegie , it 's Sally . You 've got to go over to the Hot Spot right away . " I could picture Sally in my mind 's eye : a mere slip of a girl , with milky skin and white-blonde hair , but possessed of a dark , furious glare that could pierce your vital organs like a stiletto chipped from ice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sighed . " We 've been over this already . Jason 's in charge of the party , not me . " " I know that ! But he needs you . Now . " " Why did n't he call me himself ? " I stalled . " What 's wrong ? " But as I spoke , my stomach was clenching at the thought of all the things that might be wrong : property damage , an angry neighbor , an injured guest . . . " Just go , OK ? " The stiletto stabbed deeper . " Why are you always so difficult ? You 're , what , two minutes away from there ? " Solveto 's was in the Fremont neighborhood , on the north side of the Ship Canal . " Not exactly , but --  " But Sally had already hung up , and did n't answer when I called her back . So , roundly cursing Ms. Tyler and the stack of wedding magazines she rode in on , I climbed into my van and drove south . By the time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit , and for an unusual reason : the weather . Usually , Christmas in Seattle is gray and drippy ; you get used to it . But this year , December had surprised us all with clear skies and genuinely cold temperatures . This evening had a very non-Seattle , winter wonderland feel , with Christmas trees and decorations all aglitter in the crisp darkness . Gradually , in spite of myself , I stopped cursing and starting humming " Good King Wenceslaus . " The so-called Artists ' Republic of Fremont has gone pretty mainstream these days , now that a big software firm calls it home and the fancy condos are rising high . But there are still plenty of funky shops and tempting restaurants , both new and old , and plenty of customers for all of them . Everywhere I looked tonight , Yuletide shoppers and late-night diners bustled across the intersections , trailing Christmas cheer and pale plumes of frozen breath . I wished I could join them . Instead , I crossed the Fremont Drawbridge , with its goofy blue girders and orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The festive lights disappeared behind me , and I dropped down a side street . I was driving Vanna White Too , the new replacement for my dear departed white van . She rode like a Beemer after the clanking and stalling of the old one , and we pulled up smoothly to the undistinguished brick front of the Hot Spot Cafe . At least there were no police cars in sight , and no ambulance . The angry neighbors , if there were any , must be deaf by now anyway , given the rock song now throbbing through the Cafe 's front door . The volume was unbelievable , the lyrics incomprehensible , and the message unmistakable : Me man , you woman , lie down . As I said , the Cafe 's front door was locked , so I hammered on it , then tried to peer through the gaps in the curtained windows . No telling if anyone could hear me . After one last pound , I gave up and went around back , hugging myself against the cold . I was still wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank -- as if dove-gray silk tweed could make up for all the glaring red ink on Made in Heaven 's books . Meanwhile , all day long the wind had been rising and the temperature dropping . My stylish blazer was no match for the night air , and my short skirt offered no protection against the icy gusts that kept trying to goose me . So now I was shivering as well as irritated and anxious . Out back , a wooden dining deck extended over a wedge of patchy grass and clumps of shadowy , wind-ruffled bushes . The ground sloped down to an empty bike path and a wide lane of dark , still water between concrete walls : the Seattle Ship Canal . The Ship Canal is a major waterway between Puget Sound to the west and big Lake Washington to the east , with little Lake Union in between . On summer afternoons , the Hot Spot 's patrons could sit out there on the deck to watch the big luxury sailboats and the even bigger barges passing right by : salt water meets fresh water meets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planks held nothing but stacks of plastic chairs and a silver veiling of frost . The frost flashed and sparkled in the light pouring from the sliding glass doors of the Cafe -- glass that was vibrating to a 4/4 beat . I crossed the deck , mindful of my footing , and tugged at a handle . The door stuck a moment , then slid back , and I plunged into the warm , wild atmosphere of Party Central . A quick look around revealed a scattered crowd of young men , a fog bank of cigar smoke , a spreading puddle of spilled liquor , and a massive serve-yourself Greek mess . Empty plates and glasses littered all the tables , but the mess went far beyond that : from the demolished dolmathes scattered across the pool table , to the fragments of fried calamari stuck to the ceiling , to the spatter of spanakopita on the big-screen TV , Joe 's feast had clearly been enjoyed in ways he never intended . There was broken glass here and there -- apparently juggling retsina bottles is now a recognized indoor sport -- but no broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no police . And no best man . As I peered through the fumes for Jason Kraye , I spotted Frank Sanjek , the bridegroom . He sat , alone and apparently stupefied , before an oversized TV screen on which two women of improbable physique were silently cavorting in a hot tub . Frank 's handsomely cleft chin had sunk to his chest , and beneath the curly brown hair his equally handsome and amiable eyes were drifting shut . Aside from his devotion to Sally , Frank was a pretty reasonable fellow , though , to my mind , his looks exceeded his brains by a long shot . Still , if he was n't too far gone by now , he should be able to explain Jason 's alleged emergency . Averting my gaze from the hot-tub hotties , I headed toward him . But my path was blocked by three men , all of them young and none of them sober . " Hey , she 's here ! " shouted one , a beefy fellow whose sweatshirt was anointed with something damp and garlicky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Garlic 's face was long and lantern-jawed , with coarse blond hair and small round eyes gone glassy with drink . He swayed a bit on his feet , and gazed at me with the oddest expression , a sort of hopeful leer , as he dropped one moist , meaty hand on my shoulder . " She 's finally here . " " Brilliant observation , " I said coldly . Someone turned off the music . In the heavy-breathing silence , I removed the offending hand . " Of course I 'm here . Now where 's Jason ? " No answer , just more heavy breathing . Then another of the threesome , a weaselly sort leaning on a cue stick , demanded , " How come you 're wearing , like , a suit ? " " How come she 's so flat ? " muttered the other , and there was sniggering all around . This drunken discourtesy left me speechless . While I gathered my wits to tell them off , some of the other men -- the ones who were still ambulatory -- began to congregate around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull , the movements too clumsy . More like a herd of cows . But still . . . " It ai n't whatcha got , it 's whatcha do with it ! " yelled someone from the back . " So do it ! " Whistles and more lewd comments followed . Make that a herd of bulls . A sort of testosteronic bellowing arose , and I backed away nervously -- right into Mr. Garlic . Perhaps it was unintentional , but he did n't so much fend me off as draw me in , and as I stumbled backward , his meaty hands slid around my ribs and halted conveniently at breast level . I am not a violent woman , but that tore it . In a single unthinking movement , I wrenched myself away , leading with my right shoulder , and windmilled around to land a ringing slap upside Mr. Garlic 's thick head . It was a toss-up which of us hurt the most -- the blow jolted me to the shoulder -- but at least I kept my feet . My assailant staggered into a tangled collision with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unintended and horizontal visit to the buffet table , accompanied by a mixed chorus of crashing plates , angry shouts , and drunken guffaws . A painted ceramic platter teetered dangerously on the edge of the table . What was Joe thinking , giving this crowd his good serving pieces ? I snatched at the platter and stepped back from the fray , as a new voice -- a familiar voice -- cut across the others . " Shut up , you disgusting white boys ! Carnegie , what are you doing here ? " The speaker was a young black man , tall , with rock-solid biceps gleaming darkly against a sleeveless white T-shirt . He had large , ardent eyes , and a humorous curl to his wide mouth that I knew very well . Not so much from my acquaintance with him , but from all the time I spent hanging out with his big sister . Darwin James , younger by a decade , but with a close family resemblance , was the kid brother of my best friend , Lily . " Darwin , what 's going on here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Solveto 's on the floor near his feet , half-full of crumpled packing paper . I set the platter gently inside it and brushed off my hands . Now I smelled like garlic . " I had a call to come see Jason right away . Is someone hurt ? " " Not that I know of . " Darwin shrugged , a bottle of orange juice held lightly in one long , muscular hand . " I think Jase is watching the pool players . Want me to get him ? " " Please . " I looked around . The herd was moving off , while surveying me sullenly over their shoulders . " Why 's everyone staring ? " From across the room , a sardonic tenor voice said , " Mistaken identity , do n't you think ? " From the pool room beyond the bar , a rangy , sharp-featured individual sauntered toward us through the debris-laden tables . Jason Kraye 's small , light eyes held disdainful amusement , as they often did , and a spark of malice . Or is that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our planning talks for the wedding , he 'd been cooperative enough , but always with an unctuous manner akin to mockery . " So you came , " he continued , smugly folding his arms . " I did n't expect you so soon . The thing is , we need some more booze around here . Some of these gentlemen brought their friends , and everybody was thirsty ; you know how it is . Make it a mixed case , OK ? And another rack of beer . " " What ? ! You called me over here to make a liquor run ? " The narrow lips stretched into a slow , arrogant smile . Jason , I realized , was also three sheets to the wind , though he held it better than his pals . " You 're in charge of the food and drink , are n't you ? That 's what Sally said . " " If Sally had told me this on the phone --  " But of course , that 's why she had n't told me . Because I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite sure of getting his way . " You 've got your car here anyway , why not do us a favor ? All my plastic is maxed out . " " Listen up , Jason , " I said . " If you want more liquor , you can take up a collection and get your ass to a 7-Eleven . I 'm off-duty . " Then I picked up the Solveto 's bin and turned on my heel . It was heavier than I expected -- there must be other dishes underneath -- and the dignity of my exit was compromised when I stumbled over a shish kebab . But I kicked it sternly aside and strode to the glass door . The door slid open just as I got there , and in walked -- no kidding -- Santa Claus . Salvation Army on overtime ? I wondered . A late guest with a sense of humor ? Behind me , a howl went up from the men . " That 's her ! " " She 's here ! " " Merry freakin ' Christmas ! " Meanwhile , Santa glared at me eye-to-eye -- he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work alone . " I took a closer look . Beneath the rippling white beard and padded red suit , this particular Santa Claus wore shiny scarlet lipstick and extravagant false eyelashes . I glanced down , past the big tote bag she carried : several inches of her stature came from wickedly high-heeled black boots . Enter stripper , exit flat-chested wedding planner . I stood aside to make way for Santa , and walked furiously back to my van . Ho , ho , ho .
