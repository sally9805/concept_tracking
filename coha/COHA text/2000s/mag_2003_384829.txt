Section : LAW &; JUSTICE Despite being tagged the " Corporate License to Lie Act " by critics , the law " strikes a balance between the goal of deterrence and the cost that securities fraud class actions impose on investors . " <p> THE ENACTMENT of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ( PSLRA ) was a victory for accountants , securities firms , and the high-technology industry , who were frequent targets of securities fraud class actions . Subsequent events have substantially diminished the lobbying clout of these industries . Arthur Andersen 's involvement in the accounting legerdemain at Enron and its subsequent criminal conviction have discredited the accounting industry as a whole . Incriminating emails from Merrill Lynch , Credit Suisse First Boston , and Salomon Smith Barney suggest that the stock picks that brokers offer their clients may be little more credible than the pitch of the average used-car salesman . The collapse of the high-tech bubble erased 4.3 trillion dollars in market capitalization from the NASDAQ . Those developments have left multitudes of angry investors in their wake . <p> Opponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class action bar  --  see Enron , Worldcom , and the host of lesser scandals that have followed as their great chance to undo securities litigation reform . The Enron fiasco , the plaintiffs ' lawyers claim , shows that the curbs on abusive lawsuits created by the PSLRA give corporations carte blanche to engage in fraud . William Lerach , dean of the class action bar , labels PSLRA the " Corporate License to Lie Act . " Bills have been introduced in Congress that would repeal its critical provisions . <p> Evidence does not support repealing PSLRA . In fact , securities class actions are getting filed at a record pace . Although a higher percentage of these lawsuits are being dismissed than prior to the act , the ones that survive lead to larger settlements . The combination of higher settlements in a smaller percentage of cases suggests that the class action lawsuits under PSLRA deterring corporate fraud are more cost effective . This conclusion is bolstered by the fact that post-PSLRA complaints have more delineated allegations that are more highly correlated with factors related to fraud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspicuously , fraud may influence how investors direct their capital . Firms selling securities disclose more information in an effort to attract investors . If those disclosures are fraudulent , investors will pay an inflated price for those securities and companies will invest in projects that are not cost-justified . That risk of fraud will lead investors to discount the value of securities , thus raising the cost of capital for publicly traded firms . <p> The U.S. scheme of securities regulation deploys a variety of countermeasures to discourage fraud . Reputable accounting firms audit financial statements . Audit committees of outside directors oversee company disclosures . Analysts rate them for credibility and completeness . In addition to those market mechanisms , fraud is further monitored by Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) enforcement and criminal prosecutions by the Justice Department . Class actions promise additional deterrence as well as compensation to the victims of fraud . That promise of compensation  --  and the enormous damages necessary to fulfill that promise  --  strikes genuine fear into the hearts of corporate executives . Yet , the potential for large damages undermines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compensation is important when the corporation has been selling securities through fraud , correcting fraud 's distortions in two ways . First , requiring compensation to the victim discourages the corporation from committing the fraud . Second , compensation discourages investors from expending resources trying to avoid fraud . Expenditures by both the perpetrator and the victim due to fraud are a social waste , so compensation makes sense in that context . The Federal securities laws encourage such fraud suits with a generous standard for recovery . Despite that encouragement , claims asserting a misrepresentation made by a company in connection with an offering of securities are just a small percentage of securities class actions . <p> The overwhelming majority of securities fraud class actions do not involve corporations selling securities . In the typical securities fraud class action , plaintiffs ' attorneys sue the corporation and its officers for alleged deceptions regarding the company 's operations , financial performance , or future prospects that inflate the price of the company 's stock in secondary trading markets . Because the corporation has not sold securities ( and thereby transferred wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend real resources in executing the fraud . Commonly referred to as fraud on the market , it does not create a net wealth transfer away from investors , at least in the aggregate . For every shareholder who bought at a fraudulently inflated price , another shareholder has sold : The buyer 's individual loss is offset by the seller 's gain . Assuming all traders are ignorant of the fraud , over time they will come out winners as often as losers from fraudulently distorted prices . Therefore , shareholders should have no expected loss from fraud on the market , so they would have no incentive to take precautions against the fraud . Diversification protects them . <p> Despite the lack of gain to the corporation , class action lawsuits allow a full measure of compensation from the corporation to investors who come out on the losing end of a trade at a price distorted by misrepresentation . Given the trading volume in secondary markets , the potential recoverable damages in such suits can be a substantial percentage of the corporation 's total capitalization , easily reaching hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range , class actions are a big stick to wield against fraud . Punitive sanctions of that sort are only appropriate , however , when they closely correspond to the actual incidence of fraud . Securities fraud class actions fall far short of that ideal . Distinguishing fraud from mere business reversals is difficult . The external observer may not know whether a drop in a company 's stock price is due to a prior intentional misstatement about its prospects ( fraud ) or a result of risky business decisions that did not pan out ( misjudgment or bad luck ) . Unable to distinguish the two , plaintiffs ' lawyers must rely on limited publicly available indicia ( SEC filings and press releases from the company ; evidence of insider trading by the managers alleged to be responsible for the fraud ) when deciding whom to sue . Thus , a substantial drop in stock price following news that contradicts a previous optimistic statement may well lead to a lawsuit . <p> That leaves courts with the unenviable task of sorting the meritorious cases from the strike suits . Courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowingly false statements from unfortunate business decisions . Both create a risk of liability and , thus , provide a basis for filing suit . The thinking usually is : Sue all of the plausible candidates and let the courts sort them out . Filing numerous cases is not only reasonable , but profitable for plaintiffs ' attorneys because of the incentives that defendants face . If plaintiffs can withstand a motion to dismiss , defendants generally will find settlement cheaper than litigating to a jury verdict even if the defendants believe that a jury would share their view of the facts . Moreover , any case plausible enough to get past a judge may be worth settling if only to avoid the costs of discovery and attorneys ' fees , which can be enormous . Securities fraud class actions are expensive to defend because the focus of litigation will often be scienter , that is the extent and timing of the defendants ' knowledge . The most helpful source for uncovering that fact will be the documents in the company 's possession . Producing all documents relevant to the knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a massive undertaking for a corporate defendant . Having supplied the documents , the company then can anticipate a seemingly endless series of depositions , as plaintiffs ' counsel seeks to determine whether the executives ' recollections square with the documents . Beyond the cost in executives ' time , the mere existence of the class action may disrupt relationships with suppliers and customers , who understandably will be leery of dealing with a business accused of fraud . <p> Putting to one side the costs of litigation , the overwhelming potential damages also make settlement an attractive option , even when the company is optimistic that it will prevail at trial . The math is straightforward : a 10% chance of a $250,000,000 judgment means that a settlement for $24,900,000 makes sense . The combination of the cost of litigating securities class actions and the potential for enormous judgments means that even weak cases may produce a settlement if they are not dismissed before trial . If both weak and strong cases lead to settlements , the deterrent effect of class actions is diluted because both innocent and wrongful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enacting PSLRA was to discourage frivolous litigation , believing that class actions were being filed with " a laundry list of cookie-cutter complaints " against companies " within hours or days " of a large drop in the company 's stock price . Legislators felt that a substantial number of weak cases settled because the underlying legal merits could not be determined from the complaint alone . Faced with the discovery , defendants found that " the pressure to settle became enormous . " Even if a company were willing to bear the expense of litigation , Congress concluded that the company would inevitably settle rather than face a potentially ruinous jury verdict . The overall effect was that liability exposure was chilling issuers from making statements about their business . There was concern as well that innocent bystanders were being caught in the securities fraud class action crossfire . According to the Senate Report , " underwriters , lawyers , accountants , and other professionals are prime targets of abusive securities lawsuits . The deeper the pocket , the greater the likelihood that a marginal party will be named as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rule of joint and several liability , a secondary defendant could be left holding the bag if the defendant that engaged in the fraud later became insolvent , not an infrequent occurrence . <p> Congress addressed these problems through a series of procedural obstacles . The first barrier to frivolous class actions is a " safe harbor " provision for projections that are not knowingly false , or that have been qualified by " meaningful cautionary language . " That makes it very difficult for plaintiffs to bring lawsuits based on predictions concerning the company 's future that have not come true , the archetypal " fraud by hindsight " claim . The second barrier is broader . PSLRA imposes a rigorous pleading standard , requiring plaintiffs to specify in their complaint each statement alleged to have been misleading and the reasons why it is so . It also requires plaintiffs to state with particularity facts giving rise to a " strong inference " that the defendant acted with " the required state of mind . " Judges apply these rules in reviewing the complaint before discovery , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the complaint becomes the critical document in the case  --  if the plaintiffs can not make out a credible case of fraud when they file their suit , they can not proceed with the claims . Early dismissal with no discovery greatly reduces the expense to corporations forced to defend such suits , thereby limiting the settlement value of weak cases . <p> PSLRA limits the liability of certain peripheral defendants as well . The act adopts proportionate , rather than joint and several , liability for defendants who are not found knowingly to have violated the securities laws . That protection is most important for secondary defendants , such as accountants , lawyers , and investment bankers , who may be implicated in fraud by corporate defendants . If those secondary defendants can show that they did not know of the fraud , their liability exposure will be limited substantially . <p> The average number of suits is up nearly 25% from pre-PSLRA levels , so it does not appear that the law has discouraged plaintiffs ' attorneys from filing suit . Yet , that increase in filings does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as there is evidence that PSLRA has resulted in a higher percentage of cases being dismissed . A study by the National Economics Research Associates reports that the dismissal rate for securities fraud class actions has roughly doubled since the passage of PSLRA , so nearly a quarter of all suits are now dismissed . <p> The combination of more filings and more dismissals seems contradictory . Why would plaintiffs ' lawyers waste time and effort filing suits that are likely to be dismissed ? Plaintiffs ' attorneys argue that the upsurge in filings simply reflects a massive increase in fraud . The sole difference post-PSLRA , claim the lawyers , is that meritorious suits are being dismissed . An alternative explanation for the surge in filings is that the plaintiffs ' counsel is incapable of sorting fraud from misjudgment or bad luck based on the information available to them . Consequently , they sue on the basis of bad news that may reflect either . If they can withstand a motion to dismiss , they can gain access to discovery of the corporation 's internal documents in an attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate means that plaintiffs ' lawyers need to file more suits in hopes that a reasonable number will make it through to discovery . If plaintiffs ' lawyers simply are filing more suits in the hope that a few will " stick , " PSLRA may not have achieved its goal of discouraging frivolous class actions . If those actions are quickly dismissed , however , the costs of defending them are greatly diminished . Moreover , the higher dismissal rate suggests that the sanctions that flow from securities fraud class actions are more precisely targeted  --  weaker suits are dismissed more often , while stronger claims proceed . <p> Deterrence is determined not only by the precision , but the magnitude of sanctions . Studies have found that settlements are larger for post-PSLRA cases . The available evidence points out that suits naming accountants and underwriters lead to greater settlements , suggesting that the PSLRA has not exempted secondary defendants from paying damages . <p> The impetus for calls to repeal PSLRA is easy to understand . A spate of accounting and corporate governance scandals followed shortly after the passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fraud . It 's not just the fraud headlines that support this impulse  --  the number of restatements of accounting results generally has been on the rise . Some conclude from that chronology that PSLRA " caused " corporate fraud . That logic is based on publicity rather than sound statistical inference . After a flurry of headlines trumpeting corporate wrongdoing , it is easy to be misled by a small number of high-profile cases , but the Enrons and Worldcoms are not representative of America 's corporations . There are more than 15,000 public companies in the U.S. , and a mere handful of them have been implicated in wrongdoing . Fraud always will be present , but it would be a mistake to conclude from what may be little more than a statistically insignificant blip that the U.S. is headed toward a financial apocalypse . The increased number of restatements also is misleading . Many of those are the result of shifts by the SEC in interpreting accounting rules . A company 's failure to anticipate a change in the SEC 's position does not equate to fraud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial environment that helped lead to these corporate scandals , like the popularization of stock options at the expense of more traditional forms of compensation , such as cash . The stock option craze of the late 1990s was driven in part by companies with good ideas , but little cash , who needed to attract talented employees . In addition , that frenzy was sparked by an excise tax that Congress imposed on " excessive " executive compensation in 1993  --  yet another example of the law of unintended consequences . <p> The excise tax excluded " incentive " compensation , which led to an enormous spike in the use of stock options , with a corresponding motivation to keep those options " in the money . " For the options to be lucrative , the current price of the stock had to exceed the exercise price of the option . If accounting results had to be massaged a little to inflate the stock price , what was the harm ? A dramatic loss in investor confidence , it turns out . Stock options are a useful component of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cash compensation , Congress has no business putting its fat thumb on the scale in favor of one over the other . <p> A number of bills have been introduced to undo securities class action reform . Not surprisingly , given Arthur Andersen 's role in the demise of Enron , accountants were the central target . Those bills include proposals to bring back joint and several liability for secondary defendants and to eliminate the discovery stay if auditors were named as defendants , allowing the plaintiffs ' attorney immediate access to the accountants ' work papers . Is diminished liability for secondary defendants a real concern ? Hardly . The reputational sanction for complicity in fraud is severe , as Andersen 's bankruptcy filing after its conviction for obstruction of justice shows . Accountants are in the business of renting their reputation to corporations . Once they lose their reputation for integrity , they have nothing left to sell . The market sanction for misbehavior is swifter and surer than any legal punishment PSLRA does not let secondary defendants off scot-free , either . Proportionate liability does not signify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liability . Rather it means they are responsible specifically for the incremental harm caused by their participation in the fraud . <p> Under PSLRA , secondary defendants are only entitled to the protection of proportionate liability when they lack the knowledge of the fraud . Even then they can be required to pay an additional 50% above the damages based on their fault if the issuer is insolvent . Proportionate liability offers no protection at all for secondary defendants if a jury concludes they were knee deep in the fraud . Accountants still must consider the risk of a securities fraud class action when a client tries to pressure them into acquiescing in a dubious interpretation of accounting principles . <p> Current proposals to repeal securities fraud class actions would give plaintiffs ' lawyers another weapon with which to coerce settlements . Strong sanctions are appropriate for defrauders , but it must be ensured that those sanctions are imposed on bad actors only . Honest businesspeople and professionals need to be protected against threats intended solely to generate larger settlements and attorneys ' fees . Investors are the intended beneficiaries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they bear the costs when class actions get out of control in the form of higher insurance premiums for directors ' and officers ' insurance , as well as higher fees that accountants , lawyers , and investment bankers will charge if they face unjustified litigation risk . PSLRA strikes a balance between the goal of deterrence and the costs that securities fraud class actions impose on investors . Congress will not be doing investors a favor if it opens the door to frivolous class action lawsuits and coercive settlements in its desire to get tough on corporate wrongdoers . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By Adam C.
