Prologue A long time ago in ancient Anatolia there lived a peasant farmer named Gordius who ruled an ancient city of the Lydian Empire . One day when Gordius was plowing his fields , a flock of birds gathered around his oxen . The image startled Gordius , and he knew it must be an omen . He set out to consult the augurs in a nearby town , where he met a beautiful maiden who told him the birds were a sign of his royal destiny there . Realizing the value of this peasant before her , the maiden offered herself to Gordius as his queen . Gordius then drove his oxcart to the temple , where he was immediately greeted by the people as their ruler . An oracle had informed them that the first man to arrive at their temple would be their king , and they accepted the peasant farmer with great reverence . To show how grateful he was for his new power , the farmer decided to enshrine his oxcart to the temple by attaching the yoke to the shaft with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The elaborate knot had no visible end and was considered impossible to unravel . Legend had it that whoever succeeded in unraveling the knot would be the next ruler of Asia Minor . When Alexander the Great arrived to set up his winter quarters in Gordion in 334 B.C. , he set out to fulfill the prophesy and climbed the citadel to Gordion 's oxcart . Although he knew that a knot must unravel itself , Alexander failed to loosen it and instead , sliced through it with his own sword . I June 1953 Southwestern Turkey Nurdane moved between the looms , inspecting knots . The room was cool and smelled of burnt cedar . The floor , damp , freshly washed . The chairs and desks had been pushed against the walls , where skeins of colored wool hung like wigs from the hooks and half-carved reed flutes lay propped in the windows . The lodge was normally used as a music school for boys , but on Saturday afternoons the headmaster allowed her to teach the village girls weaving , the only formal education they would ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared by two sisters and moved her fingers slowly over the pile of wool . She wiggled her pinky between the strings to search for gaps , poking her finger through the weft . She had found a large hole , the size of a coin . She raised her eyebrows in disapproval . The young girls sitting at the loom stiffened , slowly lifting their small chins to meet her gaze . They watched her lips part , waiting for a smile , begging her approval with their dark eyes . But she withheld , careful not to mislead them with a false sense of accomplishment . She found their workmanship satisfactory . They had woven a prayer rug filled with scatter motifs , stylized representations of familiar objects . A deer , flowers , sheep , water , the concerns of daily life in the village . It was not a difficult pattern , a modern prayer rug of no great beauty or merit . The center , or field , consisted of a plain red mihrab , or prayer niche , surrounded by a green border of angular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rugs , were based on geometric units . Called nakis , embroidery , the motifs had functioned as a language among the women of the weaving communities . Passed from mother to daughter , the geometric symbols were the basis of communication among the Anatolian women kept illiterate under Islam . Birds for the soul ; stars for eternity and marriage ; eyes , hooks , and amulets to protect against evil ; roses for happiness ; running water for a long life ; swastikas and dragons to protect the tree of life ; apple blossoms for fertility ; pinwheels , symbols of heaven , fortune , and hands for protection . To weave was to write and to write was to be understood . Using any one symbol or a combination of several , a Muslim woman was safe to express herself , channeling her creativity into a body that would survive her long after the Prophet had stripped her of her tribal solidarity . The sum of symbols , too , insured the Turkish woman with the only possession she could own . In possessing the rugs , women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever compromise . Like any good grammar instructor , Nurdane looked for errors in the compositions she read , her unflinching eye slashing mistakes . She had reminded her students that the choice of symbols was not the point of weaving , despite how poignant or obscure the themes they conveyed . She wondered if the two sisters had ever listened . The goal of every weaver , she reminded them , was to tie knots so strong they could hold the dead . She picked up a beater , a wooden comb , from the floor , and handed it to the youngest sister . Tighter , she instructed . Tighter ? The girl panicked and dropped the comb . Her sister snatched it from the floor . I know how to make them tighter , she said . Nurdane dropped her hand on the older girl 's shoulder . She spoke calmly . I know . So let her try . The older girl sighed and reluctantly passed the wooden comb to her sister 's trembling hands . She was younger than the rest and bony , wearing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty and her hair fell out of her headscarf in multiple braids , like a bride 's . She looked vulnerable beside the others , anxious , too , and yet she had about her a determination that Nurdane recognized as her own . She could see the pride in the arch of the young weaver 's back while the others sat slumped and defeated at the loom . The girl looked up at Nurdane with expectant eyes . What do you want me to do ? Pack it harder . The girl inserted the long , forklike slats of the beater between the weft and pulled down on the pile . Her tiny muscles bulged from her forearm . Again . But it 's already tight . Nurdane shook her head and poked her finger through the weft again . The hole smaller , but still there . Is it ? The girl lowered her gaze to the floor and shook her head , ashamed . She spoke quietly , humbled . It 's hard . I know . It takes time . The girl shifted her eyes to balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any of us at our age . I had a lot of time to learn . You must be patient . The girl swallowed , her eyes glazed like large round tiles in the light . You were better than our mothers . Better than our grandmothers , she insisted . How did you ever learn to tie them so well ? Nurdane stepped behind the loom and stood in front of the window , a silhouette in the backlight . Put your hand over your heart . All of you . Nurdane panned the room from one loom to the next until all the girls had followed her instruction . Now close your eyes . The girls shifted , the wooden benches creaking beneath their weight . And listen . The room fell silent . Only the tinkling of goat bells came in through the window . Nurdane continued . Imagine the rug has a heart . It has a rhythm , a beat . Your job as a weaver is to breathe life into the knots . Feelings . Emotions . When you 're sad , the knots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will sing . When you are confused or lonely or excited or scared , the knots will hold it all . They will remember everything about you so you do n't forget who you are . Nurdane paused for the caw of a raven , the flap of wings . Then silence again . She whispered . Every weaver records a part of herself in each knot . She watched their faces twitch , the nervous bite of their lips . Some had opened their eyes to peek at the others , then shut them quickly when they caught Nurdane watching . She continued . Now imagine your heart with a hole . Gasps from the girls . What do you hear ? Nothing . Right . Nothing . A broken heart ca n't beat . You see , if the rug has a hole because the knots are loose , the rug wo n't sing . And we like songs-because they tell us stories . She watched the girls nod , small smiles stretched across their faces as they remembered bits of folktales too ancient to unravel at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would find a place for their stories in the rugs . Nurdane stepped out from behind the loom and crossed the lodge . The slow squeak of her braces broke the silence . She stopped at the door . You can work now . The girls rubbed their eyes , trying to focus again in the harsh light that fell in triangles across the room as the morning sun shifted over the village . The air was warm and dry , sweet with sage . Nurdane stood at the door and ran her hands along the old Arabic carved in the wood , prayers she could not read . Let me hear the songs . The girls began to pluck the weft like the strings on a harp . They worked up their speed , each relying on the other to keep the pace until they synchronized the twanging of fingers into a soft , hypnotic percussion . Nurdane stepped outside and followed a stone pathway to a group of elderly women and their married daughters , who sat cross-legged , spinning wool under the shade of a fig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were building a warp , the foundation of every carpet . They used no formal measuring device to build the apparatus , estimating the length of the warp with a long plank , which they laid across the ground , and two adjustable posts , driven into the earth with stakes . The warp was prepared as one of the women walked from one pole to the other , wrapping yarn continuously around the posts , where the other women sat , crouched on their heels , inserting twine between each thread , ensuring the sequence of the warp . The process would take about five hours , so they worked quickly , speaking little , concentrating . Together with the spinners , they formed a colorful sight . Their bright , baggy trousers , blouses , and vests were a mismatch of prints and patterns leaving no empty space for the eye to rest . Most of their heads were wrapped in two cotton scarves , a white one covering their hair , tied behind the nape of their brown necks . The other , either a pastel or elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the forehead , framing their faces like a crown . Nurdane joined the spinners , lowering herself to the ground slowly , awkwardly , beneath the braces . The wind lifted her skirt , revealing her legs . The muscles were severely atrophied , the skin purple and green , her knees imprinted from the metal rim . Her upper body was completely disproportional to her lower body . Her arms were healthy , long , and slender , the muscles tight and cut over her shoulders , defined by years at the loom . The women did not stare at her legs , their eyes locked on the spindle passing into Nurdane 's bare feet , bare humps and bulbs , too misshapen for shoes . The soles had grown thick and yellow with calluses , and the toes curled like talons and reminded them of raptor 's claws . Nurdane took the spindle , anchoring the pointed end between her toes , and spun in silence . The women did not disturb her when she was teaching and kept their questions to themselves . They worked quietly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the loom . Toothless smiles among them . They were content to hear the labor of others after spending a lifetime tying their own knots , sowing , weeding , harvesting crops in the fields . Their hands had become gnarled , their fingers bony and twisted like the ancient roots of an olive tree . Most suffered from arthritis , but they insisted on spinning . They insisted in putting a part of themselves into the rugs for as long as they could . Nurdane could feel them watching her work , studying the turn of her fingers , the way her left hand fed the wool into the spindle while her right rotated it clockwise , making a Z-twist with the yarn . Her speed , twice theirs . Her movement effortless , seemingly involuntary . Spinning ran deep through her blood , passed down from her mother and grandmother and the women of Anatolia . She had never seen her mother weave , nor had she ever seen her mother , dead after childbirth . June twenty-first , the solstice , at once a celebration of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was her father who taught her to weave , borrowing from his wife 's techniques . He taught Nurdane to manipulate the flywheel , as she did now , by tilting the spindle every few seconds , to either slow down or speed up according to the dictates of her fingers . Faster now . The cadence chased the song from her lips . Songs of the nomad . The drop spindle was old technology , the most practical , too , for the nomadic life from which she came . She stopped only when the spindle was full and heavy with wool , and only then did she pause to massage the cramp in her hand . You 've been working a lot . She nodded , shifted her eyes to meet the crinkled faces of the older women . They were filled with concern now and pressed her for answers . I 'm catching up , Nurdane said . Quickly ? Fast enough . How many knots are tied ? I have n't counted yet , she said , cutting off their questions . The women lowered their heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women knew better than to beg for answers from her , but the nervous twitch of their hands , the way their fingers picked at the wool , gave them away . The women wanted to know more . When will the rug be finished ? A rug is never truly finished . Is it ? She looked up and locked eyes with them . Her quick answers frustrated them . She removed the wool from the spindle and began to spin again , interrupted by the hand of a short , squat woman pressing on her shoulder . Do n't forget who you make the rugs for . Nurdane lifted her eyes and searched the woman 's weathered face . Two silver braids dangled over the woman 's milky eyes , challenging her not to look away too soon . A bride waits for you . They always do . The old woman shook her head and leaned closer . She pressed her cheek against Nurdane 's and lowered her voice . This one is different , she said . Her life depends on you . - From The Virgin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dutton , a member of Penguin Putnam Inc. , used by permission .
