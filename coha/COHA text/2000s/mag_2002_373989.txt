In 1997 a team of Japanese engineers dared to imagine a computer so powerful that it could keep track of everything in the world at once  --  steaming rain forests in Bolivia , factories in Mexico belching smoke , the jet stream , the Gulf Stream , the works . What 's more , they dared to build it . On March 11 , 2002 , when they turned it on , the engineers did something no mere mortal had ever done before : they created the Earth . <P> Or at least the next best thing . The Earth Simulator , the most powerful supercomputer ever built , was designed for a single purpose : to create a virtual twin of our home planet . Before the Earth Simulator arrived , the fastest computer in the world was an American military machine that can perform 7.2 trillion calculations per second . The Earth Simulator runs at more than 35 trillion calculations per second , almost five times faster . In fact , it 's as powerful as the next 12 fastest supercomputers in the world put together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yokohama , the Earth Simulator is the size of four tennis courts . The price tag ? Around $350 million . <P> It was worth every penny . By plugging real-life climate data from satellites and ocean buoys into the Earth Simulator , researchers can create a computer model of the entire planet , then scroll it forward in time to see what will happen to our environment . Scientists have already completed a forecast of global ocean temperatures for the next 50 years , and a full set of climate predictions will be ready by year 's end . Soon , instead of speculating about the possible environmental impact of , say , the Kyoto accord , policymakers will be able to plug its parameters into the virtual Earth , then skip ahead 1,000 years to get a handle on what effect those policies might have . That kind of concrete data could revolutionize environmental science . By digitally cloning the Earth , we might just be able to save it .  --  By Lev Grossman               @ @ @ @ @ @
