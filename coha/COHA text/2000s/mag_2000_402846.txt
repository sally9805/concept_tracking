Section : Overview : THE LIST WELL , IT ALL DEPENDS . AND , IN FACT , THAT MAY NOT BE THE ISSUE AT ALL <p> THE BASE YEAR FOR THIS YEAR 'S crop of Inc. 500 companies , 1995 , also happens to be the year in which a certain high-profile , high-growth company began operations . Since that time , Amazon.com has gone from zero to more than $1.6 billion in sales , which gives it a growth rate that makes the Inc. 500 look like a slow and slothful lot . <p> And yet the past five years have hardly been kind to Amazon , which , judging by some of its numbers , looks more like a nonprofit charity than a billion-dollar publicly owned business . Sure , Jeff Bezos and company have created more than $12 billion in market value , but that figure has melted down from a much loftier peak of $40 billion . Even more dubious , Amazon continues to float debt  --  now $2.1 billion and counting  --  to run its business ever deeper into the red . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative economics at work . The past year has seen the virtual implosion of many dot-com businesses , leading one to wonder whether what is truly novel about the much vaunted new economy is that making a profit might actually bar you from the club . Of course , being on the Inc. 500 list is no guarantee of profitability , either , but most of the companies seem to have their eyes on more than the top line . Of the 76 companies founded in 1995 on this year 's list , 60 report that they are now profitable . <p> Building a company in today 's overramped economy seems like a cruel twist on the classic tortoise-versus-the-hare tale . On one hand , it would be nice to move slowly in order to build a solid foundation . On the other hand , no one can really afford such a luxury . You have to grow fast . But when exactly does fast become too fast ? <p> " Speed is a critical component of success , " says Dan Weinfurter , founder of Parson Group , the #1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow quickly , or others will beat you at your game . " But speed , Weinfurter adds , can quickly undermine quality and fiscal discipline . To solve that problem , the financial consulting firm , based in Chicago , opened offices not in the biggest markets but in places where it knew top-drawer people who could manage those offices . ( See " Ready , Set , Grow . " ) <p> Another check on growth for the sake of growth was Parson 's throttling back for a year to digest its gains . That disciplined the company to slow its burn rate , achieve profitability , and make sure things were running right before Parson revved itself back up again . <p> Weinfurter foresees that Parson will have 30% to 40% growth in each of the next few years but not simply because the business is there for the taking . The need for growth is more complicated than that . To begin with , people want to work at high-growth companies to further their careers , and if the growth is n't there , the talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even contemplating going public , Wall Street expects at least 40% growth as a " benchmark minimum , " says the Parson founder . <p> As for the public markets , Weinfurter comments on " the craziness that is going on today . I know people who have great companies , they hit their numbers , and the stock 's one-quarter the price of what it was . All their people are leaving , " he laments . <p> That sense of bewilderment is all but endemic , even among successful high-growth companies . Just ask Michael Hodges , the founder of Cherokee Information Services Inc. , #76 on this year 's list . " If I had it to do over again , I would n't have started this business , " he says flatly . It 's not because Hodges does n't like what he 's doing ; it 's because he feels too darned old to keep up with today 's demands of growth . Hodges , who is 55 , would like to spend more time with his grandchildren , yet he finds himself working seven days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there used to be privately held companies with 25 employees or fewer that were steadily profitable . " But that paradigm does n't work anymore , " he says , because the market places such a premium on high growth . " There 's too much money out there , too much consolidation , and there 's an explosion in information technology . And all that is dragging a lot of traditional companies along . " On top of that , employees want the " bragging rights " of working for high-growth companies . <p> Still , Hodges is determined to somehow make growth work for him  --  by implementing a five-year exit plan that will transfer ownership of his Arlington , Va. , company to his employees . " That 's my measure of success , " he says . It 's not how fast he can grow the company but how successfully he can shepherd it before handing it over to others . Hodges says that maybe that 's about the best you can do in an economy that often rewards growth at the expense of profitability  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One company that fell into the growth trap was CyberTech Systems Inc. ( formerly Cybertech International ) , a provider of information-technology services in Oak Brook , Ill . The company was riding high a year ago at #5 on the 1999 Inc. 500 . Cofounder Prasad V. Rao had cranked up the business , taking it from $26 million in 1997 to $52 million in 1998 . But then the company 's momentum slowed . CyberTech had sales of only $60 million last year , far below its projected $85 million to $90 million . The company 's dynamic technology markets shifted , and it was caught pushing a software solution that nobody wanted . It has taken the company a year and a half to regroup . <p> What Rao learned was that growth was literally worthless  --  CyberTech reported a loss in 1999  --  if it came at the expense of understanding the market . " We have to look harder to see those waves coming , " says Rao , who has since diversified the business , has put more effort into planning , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest technologies . By 2001 , CyberTech expects to be back in the black , and Rao believes it can comfortably grow at 30% to 40% a year . <p> Perhaps Rao 's experience contains the answer to the riddle of how fast is fast enough when it comes to growth . It is not so much about hitting goals in record speed as how easily you can tame growth and convert it to a level of profitability that can sustain a business . <p> One thing seems clear in today 's economy : growth seems more random and more unexpected than ever . So perhaps the fitting response to that reality is that companies must find a way to plan for that random growth . That , in essence , is what vaulted Keystone RV Co. to the #2 spot on this year 's Inc. 500 roster . <p> You might think Keystone is another one of those software " solutions " companies that does inexplicable things with technology . It 's not . Keystone is in the business of making recreational vehicles , an industry that even in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Keystone 's five-year growth rate , on the other hand , is 17,117% . How did that happen ? <p> To begin with , founder Cole Davis came from another company in the industry that had experienced high growth , and all along he planned for Keystone to follow a similar path . He designed a business model that would use manufacturing capacity more efficiently and target more niche markets than his past employer did . He was confident the model would foster growth . <p> " From my experience I was aware that a company could grow fast . A lot of people never had that opportunity , " says Davis . " Our model from the get-go has been rapid growth . " <p> He also tempers the effects of that growth by planning for it . " I start selling an idea to our entire staff up to a year before we want to implement it , " he says . That has resulted in Keystone 's actually exceeding its ambitious targets . In 1997 , Davis projected 1999 sales of $120 million , and revenues came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course to exceed its $190-million target by $60 million . And Davis expects the company to surpass $550 million in 2001 . <p> Keystone , based in Goshen , Ind. , seems to be a curiosity , an old-line company in an economy that celebrates the new and wondrous . And , when Davis talks about the business , he sounds similarly old-fashioned . Keystone , he says , is " a relationship business . We have attracted people who have been in the industry for years , and their relationships give us entre into the marketplace . " It sounds like a throwback to the quaint idea that success in business is about who you know , not what you know . <p> In truth , success in business has come to be about surviving the best way you can in a volatile economy , and whatever strategy works best in achieving that aim is the right one . For now , companies like Keystone have mastered growth not so much by growing at the right pace but by growing in the right way . <p> By Edward O.
