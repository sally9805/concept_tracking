INNOCENT BYSTANDER Headnote When our standards do n't live up to our standards // Earlier this fall the literary critic Harold Bloom unloosed a memorable blast in the Los Angeles Times . His target was the National Book Foundation and its decision to bestow an award for " distinguished contribution " to the novelist Stephen King . This award , Bloom noted , had previously been given to such masters of the literary craft as Saul Bellow , Philip Roth , and Arthur Miller , whereas Stephen King 's thrillers " sell in the millions but do little more for humanity than keep the publishing world afloat . " Bloom saw the decision to honor King as one more episode in " the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life . " Shortly before Bloom 's article appeared , that same paper ran a news story about yet another instance of sliding norms-in this case , involving how the military deals with its deserters . I remember reading about a scholarly conference in Belgium some years ago on the subject of executions for desertion during World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong to regard the fleeing soldiers as derelict in their duty ; they were n't deserting , silly , they were " merely exploring the boundaries of consent and personal motivation in a democracy at war " ( the boundaries being somewhat to the rear ) . That argument has now been embraced in spirit by the U.S. Army , which today-even under the Bush Administration and in time of war-almost never prosecutes deserters and , according to the news account , takes a " passive , good-riddance approach to its runaways . " In 2001 about 5,000 people decided to simply up and leave the U.S. military . No American has been shot for desertion since 1945 . Whatever happened to standards ? This has been a consistent refrain of social observers and literary critics down through the ages , and although some of these people are professional curmudgeons , it 's hard to argue that they do n't have a point . My father , when informed that Bill Clinton had admitted to indulging in " inappropriate " behavior with Monica Lewinsky , observed that he could remember a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public after 6:00 P.M. An article in the pages of this magazine in 1892 took note of softening standards for admission to Harvard , but the " new " criteria it described ( including " an elementary working knowledge of four languages , two ancient , Latin and Greek , and two modern , French and German " ) would seem almost laughably stringent to modern eyes . Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan , writing in The American Scholar a decade ago , described how society 's increasingly relaxed standards were allowing more and more marginal behavior to gain gradual acceptance . He called the process " defining deviancy down . " // As foreigners are often quick to point out , the entire American way of life sometimes seems to be a monument to eroding standards . One of George Carlin 's most famous routines , back in the 1970s , centered on the seven words one could n't use on television or radio . Today most of those words are used multiple times in any episode of The Sopranos . In many jurisdictions people were once drawn for service on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now so low in some places that courts must draw from the pool of people with driver 's licenses . Until recently it was rare for professional basketball teams to recruit players directly from high school ; high school students , it was argued , simply lacked sufficient personal or athletic maturity . LeBron James , Tracy McGrady , and Kevin Garnett , among others , show what has happened to this standard . For most of my lifetime North America had only five lakes that were officially deemed Great-until 1998 , when Congress voted to classify Lake Champlain , on the border between Vermont and New York , as a sixth Great Lake . The provision was actually signed into law , but was later revoked . ( The instigator of Champlain 's enhancement , Senator Patrick Leahy , of Vermont , gamely weathered criticism as " the Fourth Stooge . " ) Of course , the situation with respect to standards is not straightforward , because for every example of declining norms in one area of life there is an example of rising norms somewhere else . Educators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing , but there 's no question that assessment tests are increasingly widespread , having been mandated by the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 . Almost every state has by now set a blood-alcohol concentration of .08 percent as the legal threshold for intoxication while driving-stricter than the 0.1 percent that used to be common . It is well known that language purists in France vociferously resist the encroachment of words from America ; but the French have been joined in this hand-wringing by worried elites in England , Russia , Spain , and elsewhere . The writing of a resume was once a personal and even idiosyncratic enterprise , encompassing a variety of approaches , but there now exists a Professional Association of Resume Writers and Career Coaches to certify practitioners and enforce a code of ethics . And although the Pentagon may have become lax on the matter of desertion , it is a Torquemada on the matter of obesity . In fiscal year 2002 the Marine Corps discharged eighty-eight people because of an excessive percentage of body fat ; the Air Force discharged 394 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not discharge anyone for obesity-perhaps because in that service the extra buoyancy is actually an advantage . ) The Russians , no doubt honoring some vestigial memory of superpower competition , have shown a similar resolve in the weight department . Last September the overseers of the Bolshoi Ballet dismissed the well-known ballerina Anastasia Volochkova on the grounds that " she is hard to lift . " In his book The Control of Nature , John McPhee described the dynamic of upthrust and erosion in the mountains of southern California . " The San Gabriels , in their state of tectonic youth , are rising as rapidly as any range on earth , " he wrote , and then added , " Shedding , spalling , self-destructing , they are disintegrating at a rate that is also among the fastest in the world . " Standards experience a similar dynamic . The body dimensions of the original Barbie doll were such that if she were life size , the critical measurements would be 38-18-34 . But in 1998 Mattel introduced a revised doll , Really Rad Barbie , whose unofficial extrapolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A box of Crayola crayons once held a single crayon whose shade was designated " flesh " - roughly the color of a piglet after a warm bath . Now Crayola markets a whole box devoted entirely to flesh tones : peach , mahogany , sepia , burnt sienna-the full Benetton spectrum . Some standards are n't worthy of the name in the first place , and in any event standards will always be in flux . But surely there are a handful on which we might all agree to hold the line-this far and no further , unto the end of days . To start this long-overdue public conversation , I 'll propose ten . I. " EMPLOYEES MUST WASH HANDS BEFORE RETURNING TO WORK " ( " Los empleados deben lavarse las manos antes de regresar al trabajo " ) . II . " Women and children first " ( except maybe Ann Coulter ) . III . Notoriety does not denote " famousness , " enormity does not denote " bigness , " and religiosity does not denote " religiousness . " IV . " The bat shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches in diameter at the thickest part and not more than 42 inches in length . The bat shall be one piece of solid wood .
