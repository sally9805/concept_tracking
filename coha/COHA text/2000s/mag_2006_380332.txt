Did James Frey , on the night of Oct. 24 , 1992 , pull up outside a bar in Granville , Ohio , in a white Mercury ? Was he both drunk and high on crack at the time ? Did he jump the curb , bump a cop with said Mercury and then get dragged out of the car screaming by the police , who proceeded to beat him up ? <P> Did he then go to rehab , write a book about it , inspire millions of readers and make a ton of money ? <P> A lot of the stories Frey tells in his 2003 memoir , A Million Little Pieces , are currently in dispute , but that last tale is n't . To date A Million Little Pieces has sold about 3.5 million copies , helped not a little by the fact that Oprah Winfrey chose it as her book club 's third nonfiction title . She proclaimed Frey the Man Who Kept Oprah Awake at Night . The only book that sold better than A Million Little Pieces last year was Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , My Friend Leonard , did n't do too badly either . <P> But what exactly did those millions of readers buy ? A Million Little Pieces is the gritty , graphic , bombastic story of an Angry Young Man who  --  despite his well-concealed heart of gold  --  manages to get himself addicted to drugs and booze . After a string of arrests and a lot of self-destructive behavior , he winds up in a Minnesota rehab clinic , where he befriends a scary-funny gangster ( also with a heart of gold ) and falls in love with a tragic recovering crack addict ( ditto ) . Redemption ensues . <P> On Jan. 8 , however , the Smoking Gun ( www
