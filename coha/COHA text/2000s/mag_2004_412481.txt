SIX INSPIRING STORIES FROM THE FRONT Eric Fulmer Age 34 . He credits his new job to his " energy and enthusiasm and aggressiveness " - and his network of friends and colleagues . At 34 , Eric Fulmer was ready for a new job . he was ambitious , and his position as a regional sales manager for a technology company in North Carolina did n't offer enough opportunities for growth . he knew that having work made him one of the lucky ones . To land another , better job he 'd have to sell himself with every bit of the savvy he put into selling his company 's products . He 'd always made a point of sending holiday cards and making the occasional phone call to his old colleagues , figuring the contacts might come in handy one day . he was right . When he heard that the man who had hired him to work at Fuji earlier in his career had joined Rimage , a manufacturer of CD and DVD publishing systems , he called to offer congratulations . It had been more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it took only a few minutes to discover that there might be a place for Fulmer . He wasted no time . Rimage called for an interview in Atlanta on a Friday ; Fulmer said he 'd be there on Monday . he could have made the eight-hour drive from his home in Chapel Hill ; instead he invested his own cash in a plane ticket and used the time he saved to create what he thinks convinced the company to hire him : a PowerPoint presentation that showcased what he could do for the company . " I thought it would be a lot better than just talk , " he explains . It worked . " What got me the job , " Fulmer concludes , " was my energy and enthusiasm and aggressiveness . It 's the lesson of the story : Go above and beyond . " Above and beyond , certainly . Over the top , perhaps . But that 's an example of what it takes to land a job in what some economists are calling the toughest job market since the 1930s . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across a wide range of industries and from coast to coast , " says Mark Zandi , chief economist at Economy.com . " And if you 've lost your job , in all likelihood you will remain unemployed for longer than in any period since the Great Depression . " While the unemployment rate has dipped to 5.6% , that simply reflects the fact that layoffs have slowed . " That 's not helping people who are already out of work , " Zandt says . " Companies have yet to step up and start hiring . " But Fulmer and the five others you 'll read about here beat those odds . Read on to see how they did it-and how you can too . SHE KEPT UP TO DATE-AND KEPT IN TOUCH Brenda Carter Age 55 . While she was unemployed , she stayed current in her field and learned new computer programs . Brenda Carter worked as an executive , specializing in purchasing , for more than 30 years before seeing the inside of an unemployment office . She had just started a new job at R.R. Donnelley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 53 , Carter found herself out of a job . " It did n't seem so bad , " she recalls . " I got a package and I decided to take a little time off . " That was in June 2001 . Before she knew it , her time off had turned into a year . Carter posted her resume with several retained executive-search firms , which are hired and paid by a company looking to fill an open position . " It means they have the jobs already , " she explains . " That 's a real advantage , because at my level those kinds of jobs are n't advertised . " Acutely aware of her younger competition , she spent time mastering new computer programs . Toward the end of the year , she began consulting for Mercury Marine ; after two months , they offered her a position as commodity manager . There were many reasons for Carter to refuse : a three-hour commute , two or three weeks of overseas travel a month and a lower salary . But her family needed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resume up to date and stayed in touch with the search firms . A full year later , the phone rang . The caller was Anthony Jones , a recruiter at Minority Executive Search in Cleveland . He 'd been retained by Johnson Controls , an automotive systems company , to hire a director of purchasing and logistics for North America . Jones deserves credit for spotting Carter 's qualifications and making the match with Johnson , but it 's Carter who ultimately sold herself . She stayed current in procurement and operations , and was not shy about sharing radical ideas about teamwork with her interviewer . She exuded confidence . " I do very well at interviews , " the new grandmother confirms . " Always . " A GUERRILLA JOB-HUNTING SITE GOT THE WORD OUT Connie Guglielmo Age 41 . The website 8GoodPeople.com helped her find freelance work and impressed the man who finally hired her . After a frustrating two-year search , technology journalist Connie Guglielmo finally found a job in December-with a little help from seven of her friends . Laid off in November 2001 from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guglielmo was a media casualty of the Bay Area dotcom bubble . " If you do n't have an industry , you do n't need media to cover it , " she says . Her unemployment benefits exhausted , Guglielmo turned up some freelance work , but full-time employment eluded her . It was during some of her most difficult days that Guglielmo decided to band together with seven other writers around the country to take their plight to the Web . " We all had done everything right-updated our resumes and contacted our networks , but the economy is so bad that nothing was working , " explains Guglielmo . So she rallied the troops to network , commiserate and do what they loved the most : write . The result was 8GoodPeople.com , an experiment in reality programming and guerrilla jobhunting . They sent press releases about the website to every news organization they could think of and alerted all their journalist friends . The website serves partly as an opportunity for the writers to attract and impress potential employers by posting a biography and pieces that they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to document this jobless recovery ? We 're journalists , " says Guglielmo . But the site quickly became something else just as important : an emotional release . Many of the essays offer personal testimony to the challenges of extended unemployment in a way that helped the writers cope . Guglielmo credits the site for getting her through . " It was an outlet for all of us , " she says . " The long-term despair , the hopelessness of unemployment-it 's been a way to relieve that . " More important , the site helped all eight good people find leads and freelance , contract or consulting jobs . So far , three of the eight have found full-time work . Guglielmo got her current job , working for a major news organization as a technology reporter , through a referral from a friend . " But the guy who was interviewing me for my current job saw the site and was impressed with it . It certainly helped , " she says , adding , " Five good people are still looking for work . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero . " BEING WILLING TO MOVE-RIGHT NOW-WAS THE KEY Eric Green Age 39 . A Labor Department website got him the interview-and he cinched the job by moving 700 miles in three weeks . Seventy-two hours . That 's the longest Eric Green had ever gone without a job . Until last June , that is , when the Phoenix start-up he 'd been with for two years announced it was going belly up . " I 'd known for some time the company was n't doing well financially , " he says . " My resume was up to date . " Green , an information technology guy with experience in the data-storage industry , posted his resume online , sent it to members of his industry trade group and perused the trade magazines . When he filed for unemployment , his resume also went into America 's Job Bank , an online resource for employers and job seekers developed by the Department of Labor . The lowdown on the job bank is what you 'd expect of a government enterprise-you put your name in because you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nah . But Eric Green did-as a software engineer at StorAd , a start-up in San Jose , Calif , that is building a next-generation data-storage product . " I think the No. 1 reason I got a job is because I cast a wide net and I was willing to move , " he says . " I did n't stick to one geographical location . " What 's more , the company wanted him to start in three weeks , and Green was not only willing but eager to meet StorAd 's deadline : After being unemployed for three months , he was in debt . But could he really get to San Jose that quickly ? The biggest problem was the house he owned in Phoenix . He knew he could n't afford to carry it for long . He considered renting it but soon found out that because the Phoenix rental market was soft , he could n't charge enough to cover his costs . His real estate agent came to his rescue , he says , by underpricing his home just enough to bring in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little ambivalent about his new rented digs-he misses the open spaces of Phoenix but loves the ethnic restaurants around San Jose . He 's decidedly less ambivalent about the work : " It 's challenging . I did n't have to take a job I did n't want . " And the biggest attraction : he believes he actually has a chance to take a product to market . VOLUNTEERING WAS HER ROUTE TO OPPORTUNITY Rebecca O'Mara Age 38 . Doing leadership training for a Hispanic group in Chicago led to her introduction to executives a Caterpillar . Rebecca Martinez O'Mara insists that she got her job because she stopped looking for one . " It 's just like what a friend once told me , " she says with a laugh . ' " The minute chicks know you 're interested , they 're not . ' " O'Mara may credit her new position-as director of business development for remanufacturing at Caterpillar-to her decision to stop sending out resumes , but it took more than that for her to land this plum job . She became an active and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the attention of the right people . A former Ameritech executive-her position was squeezed out in 2000 after a merger-O'Mara was unemployed for almost a year . " All of the job-search gurus say send out letters to CEOs , " she says . " I sent out 400 letters with zero response . I think being midcareer is a different ball game . It takes customized networking . There has to be a unique approach . " After earning an executive M.B.A . from the Kellogg School of Management , she took a less than ideal position as a global account executive at Underwriters Laboratories . She felt underutilized , and compensated by doubling her commitment to volunteer work for the Hispanic Alliance for Career Enhancement ( HACE ) , a national organization that nurtures Latinos ' career ambitions , beginning with high school students . In fact , HACE had helped O'Mara get her first job out of college . For almost two years , O'Mara worked at UL by day and gave motivational speeches for HACE whenever she had a chance . The longer she led this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she wanted more than a job ; she wanted a career that she could fall in love with , that felt like a perfect fit . Then , last December , HACE invited 25 of the " best and brightest in Chicago 's Latino community , " according to the group 's chair , Abe Tomas Hughes , to meet six Caterpillar vice presidents for dinner at the Palmer House . " I knew you did not get to have dinner with six of the top executives in the world more than once , " O'Mara recalls . So she prepped . She researched the company on the Internet . She learned what Caterpillar was doing in China and who its major competitors were . She rehearsed her one-minute elevator speech-and she wore the burgundy silk pants suit she 'd had made in Hong Kong . " I was in the zone , " she says . " I was like Michael Jordan . " Two months later , Caterpillar invited 10 of the original HACE group of 25 to visit the company 's headquarters in Peoria . O'Mara was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may insist that her success lies in her decision to opt out of the job-search market . But dig a little deeper and you find that her thinking is n't as magical as it may at first appear . Once she no longer felt driven to hunt for a better job , she had the freedom to spend her own time as she pleased , volunteering at HACE . And that raised her profile , especially with the organization 's CEO . " I was at the top of Abe 's mind , " she says of the man who set up the opportunity that has brought fulfillment in her career at last . " And he knows I 'm the blue chip . " HIS TECH SKILLS GOT HIM IN THROUGH THE BACK DOOR Gilbert Wilson Age 24 . He used his technical skills to get his foot in the door at an international policy center in the capital . Gilbert Wilson graduated from Allegheny College in 2003 with a double major in political science and religious studies , and a single dream : a paying job in international policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he needed income fast . Since policy jobs were few and far between in his native Pennsylvania , he took a gamble and moved to Washington , D.C. , where he might have a real shot at getting the job of his dreams . " I knew the job market was n't in my favor , " says Wilson , 24 , " but I was determined to try . " He had only about three months ' worth of cash and credit , so he hit the ground running . He contacted more than 50 organizations that specialize in national security , international relations or conflict resolution , faxing and e-mailing his resume and following up with phone calls . His worst fears were confirmed . " I was told over and over that they loved my resume but did n't have the money to hire me . " He even beseeched his congressman for a recommendation and advice . " I was just about out of options , " Wilson says . After almost three months of searching for the right position , Wilson spotted an advertisement for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Non-Proliferation . The institution was just the kind of place he wanted to work , and although the job was n't what he was looking for , he did have the right skills for it . He 'd spent his high school and college years , he explains , as a committed techie and computer hobbyist : " I participated in work/study programs in school , then worked part time in a local mom-and-pop computer business . " Sensing that the Web post might be a way into the international policy world , Wilson reconfigured his resume to reflect his technical skills , then sent an e-mail and followed up with a phone call . " I told them I ultimately wanted policy work , " he recalls , " but I was willing to get in any way I could . " Then he created and posted a website that offered customized Web-design ideas for the center . " During my first meeting I asked the interviewer to pull up the URL , " explains Wilson . " I wanted them to know that I was n't just blowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in policy issues has turned out to be a real advantage . " Because I understand the nature of our mission , " he says , " I can make better technical recommendations . " Wilson performs a variety of different technology tasks at the center , including website maintenance , database management and general office work . He also serves as the intern coordinator , sifting through students ' resumes daily . Since he fixes all the computers and installs software , he works with senior staff on a regular basis . " Everyone is always happy to see me . " And , after seven months on the job , he 's found some opportunities to do some research and policy work as well . " I got in through the back door , " he says , " and actually got what I wanted . " Sidebar <p>
