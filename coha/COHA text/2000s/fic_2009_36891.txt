Sydney , Australia , August 17 , 2004 <p> " I 'm not Albert C. Ward III . My name is Herbert Goldman ! There must be a mistake . " The man in the hospital bed was insistent . <p> I was amused . <p> " Look here , " he tried again , when he saw my knowing smile . " I 'm a sick man . The doctors say I should n't get overexcited . What you 're doing to me is murder , you in a hospital gown that bared his backside , and a feeding tube crawled under the top part . Looking at him , I almost felt sympathy . Albert C. Ward III could have been any other patient in the ward : a slight , almost unnoticeable middle-aged man , lying there now like a deflated balloon . But that was Ward 's greatest asset . Who 'd be suspicious of a small man in his late forties , whose few remaining teeth were n't in such great shape ? He had thinning hair that he combed sideways , applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side where it still grew , and loaning it to the side where hair was long gone . <p> We had just met for the first time , but I knew who I was dealing with . Right there in his hospital bed , he might have seemed older than his years , and he might have seemed humble . Albert C. Ward III was humble ; he would n't confront or cross you on anything , unless you were an investor or a banker sitting on some money , while he was thirsty for cash . The problem was that he was always thirsty . To quench that thirst , Ward would become a human chameleon and change from nobody to somebody in a heartbeat-a sneaky little devil , who 'd siphon money from banks and walk silently away while the banks collapsed into the receiving hands of federal regulators for being undercapitalized , while investors lamented the loss of their uninsured savings , and while American taxpayers picked up most of the bill . Yes , that was Ward 's expertise . He was a banker for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greed . A con artist of epic proportions . <p> Ward was the only patient in a small room at the internal-medicine department of Macquarie Street Hospital in Sydney , Australia . It was a public hospital in the city center , not far from my hotel . Ward could have been mistaken for the man behind the counter at the post office ... the refrigerator repairman , maybe . But that 's not entirely fair to say . Those good people never made history . Albert C. Ward III did . <p> One detail set Ward apart from the other patients in the hospital : a uniformed Australian policeman sat beside him , making sure that Ward would n't vanish again . Ward lay there in a simple metal-frame hospital bed , its white paint chipping around the edges . The room was clean , almost sterile , but no one would linger unless they had to . The unbroken view of cement wall , the smell of antiseptic mixed with human urine , and the hollow eyes of patients for whom this would be the last stop ensured that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely not the last stop . This was his usual route-feigning a critical illness , approaching death 's door when he felt the law closing in on him . The history Albert C. Ward III made was n't an achievement to be inscribed on his tombstone when the time came . He would n't make the record books . But still , he was a champion of something . Otherwise , how could he have evaded law and justice for nearly two de cades , not to mention evading me for longer than any other target I 'd ever chased ? Well , he had come close . <p> The only available pictures of him , dating back to high school , were on my desk , at home , and even in my car . Ward was a wanted man . Everyone was after him , including the FBI and the Office of Asset Recovery and Money Laundering of the U.S. Department of Justice ( with me their senior investigative attorney ) . All of my life-three years at the Mossad , Israel 's foreign intelligence ser vice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been leading up to this . As an investigative attorney at DOJ , I 'd been finding the money launderers , the scammers , the con artists who made off with other people 's money and stashed it away in sunny , far-off places and brought it back to the United States . Sometimes I also brought home the perpetrators . We called them absconders , targets , or defendants ; the tax havens of the world called them investors . Obviously there was an ongoing conflict between me , the asset hunter , and these exotically located asset protectors . A better word would be battle , or even war . Conflict is a laundered word for stiff-upper-lip delegates at the UN . <p> We had long been at war with the money launderers and their guardians . And when you 're at war , you enlist the finest . As for whether I fit into that category , well , you could ask any of the people who dealt with me professionally-that is , if you could get into prison to find them . So although I had pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bed , I was still awed by how he had managed to pull it off . Not once , not twice , but eleven times . And those were only the cases in which the FBI had determined him to be the main suspect . Who knew how many others there had been ? <p> " Mr. Ward , " I said . " I 'm quite impressed with your display . But would you kindly stop the drama and talk to me ? " His resistance impelled me to try again . <p> " Here you go again , " he sighed . " I 'm not Ward , my name is Herbert Goldman . " I noticed a slight accent when he pronounced the word here . <p> " I need to rest , I do n't feel too well . You 'll have to excuse me . " He closed his eyes and turned his face to the wall . I stood there for five more minutes until a nurse came in . <p> " Please , you are disturbing our patient , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had thought Albert C. Ward III was disturbing my patience . <p> The policeman looked bored as he sat there apparently not listening . He never said a word . <p> The cafeteria outside was just about to close for the day . There was only one other diner , a man with a protruding nose hair noisily slurping a soup that even from a distance smelled like my socks after two weeks of basic training in the desert . I was hungry , and meat loaf with potato pancakes seemed safe . But one bite was enough . The meat loaf was probably made of the ass of an ass , and the potato pancakes tasted as if they had been fried in castor oil and lightly seasoned with sawdust . The plate smelled of ammonia . I pushed the tray away . Even my voracious appetite had its limits . Anyway , it was time to write my report on my meeting with Ward . My boss , David Stone , the director of the Office of Asset Recovery and Money Laundering , was going to love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how long I had waited to face Ward , how long I had mentally prepared what I would say to him . But when the time had finally come , there had been no bombast , no fireworks . Just hollow emptiness . I was n't recognizing yet that the battle was n't over , it had just begun . <p> It was n't just the anticlimax , I quickly realized . I was still disturbed by the meeting and did n't quite know why . Something just was n't sitting well . <p> I pulled out my cell phone and called Peter Maxwell , the curly-haired , easygoing Australian Federal Police agent assigned to help me . I decided not to share with him the tinge of doubt I had . <p> " I think it 's him all right , " I told Peter . " Let 's wait for the U.S. Department of Justice to prepare the request for provisional arrest with a view toward extradition . Meanwhile , just make sure he does n't leave the hospital until the request arrives . " <p> " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " What do you mean , might ? " I asked in a startled voice . " He could still leave ? " <p> Peter , with his heavy Australian accent , had actually meant " mate . " <p> " I mean , we 've a court order for the next twelve days on local Australian fraud offenses . Until then , you 're safe , but the criminal division of the Justice Department better hurry . " <p> " What did he do this time ? " I asked . <p> " Sold the same real-estate property to three different people , " said Maxwell , chuckling . " But the land was n't even his in the first place . " <p> The next call was to David Stone in Washington , DC . <p> " David , I just saw the Chameleon . " <p> " Good . What 's the latest color ? " David never was much for emotion . He could be elated , but he 'd speak with the same tone of a voice as if I 'd told him it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . But David , it 's going to be harder this time for him to change it up . He gave me a show that unfortunately wo n't be coming to a movie theater near you . The hot part is that the Australians have him on unrelated charges . " <p> " We 're sure it 's him ? " <p> " Pretty sure . The guy I saw matches Ward on seven points . Some physical , some circumstantial . " <p> " Only pretty sure ? " asked David . <p> I hesitated . " There are a few things that are still holding me back , " I said . " He 's been calling himself Herbert Goldman . " <p> We talked over some procedural stuff , how the Australians would need to positively ID him before they 'd extradite him . <p> " But that crap 's not the problem , " I said . " The Australian police can verify our ID information . Anyway , I 'm after the money , not the body . " I paused . " Any word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only have twelve days to get that provisional arrest request here . " <p> He sighed . " Hold on . I need to take another call . " <p> A few minutes later , David came back on the line and told me that the FBI had just received a memo from the Australian Federal Police that the suspect had n't been fingerprinted yet , because he was in the hospital . <p> " They did n't ? " I said . " Well , I think I can solve that problem . " <p> I waited until evening visiting hours to return . The corridor and the nurses ' station were empty , so it was n't hard to borrow a plastic bag and a doctor 's white coat from a nearby closet . Ward was sound asleep and snoring . A policewoman read a newspaper beside him . Nonchalantly , I slid one hand into the bag and , with my fingers protected by the plastic , picked up the empty water cup from his side table . With my other hand I peeled the bag off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding prints of my own , and walked away , returning the coat to its place . The policewoman did n't even blink . <p> Peter Maxwell was sitting at his desk , rubbing his eyes over a pile of papers , when I arrived . I held out the plastic bag . " Check the prints on the cup , and match it with the sample the FBI sent you . That 'll convince you . " <p> " Dan , I 'm already convinced , but it may not be enough for the court . There could be an argument that this fingerprint evidence was compromised . " <p> " That 's not for the court , " I said . " It 's for law-enforcement purposes . I 'm afraid if there 's any doubt about his identity , he 'll be let go even after the extradition request comes in . The prints on the cup will do for now . " <p> After a pause , Peter agreed . I 'd liked him from the moment we 'd met . He was a tall , brown-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling , willing to help , and never put bureaucratic obstacles where none were necessary . He also had that quirky , uniquely Australian sense of humor that can inject levity even into the most serious circumstances . So can I. During one of our conversations , somehow the subject of Jewish holidays came up . " Sounds mighty complicated , mate , " he said . <p> I smiled . " Not really . It can be summed up easily : Our enemies tried to destroy us . They could n't . We survived . Let 's eat . " <p> When I 'd seen his toothy grin , I knew that he got it . <p> Back to Albert C. Ward III , now claiming to be Herbert Goldman . He had all the reasons in the world to fight extradition to the United States . In fact , he had eleven good and solid reasons , each of them a case bundled neatly into an indictment . He was on the line for ninety-eight counts of bank fraud , money laundering , grand larceny , and more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could outsmart the world usually made one mistake too many . Albert C. Ward III 's mistake was trying to scam someone who did n't deserve it . It was , indirectly , how I 'd finally found him . I know I should never trade luck for skill , but there are exceptions . <p> Sheila Levi was forty-one , with no special attributes . She was n't very pretty , or rich , or smart . But she was a nice woman , and she 'd had the misfortune to fall in love with Ward . Sheila had worked as a secretary in a small Sydney law firm and had never married . Ward had charmed her , wined and dined her , and soon moved in with her to the one-bedroom apartment she 'd bought after years of saving every penny , taking a big mortgage . <p> The rest of the story was sadly predictable , as I realized when she met me for lunch the day after my frustrating hospital interview with Ward . At his suggestion , she had taken a second mortgage on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their future . " She 'd given him the jewelry she 'd inherited from her grandmother , which he sold immediately . But Sheila still had faith in him . Why ? <p> " I wanted so much to marry and have a family , " she said , sobbing , sitting opposite me in the dining room of my Sydney hotel . " He proposed marriage , and I believed him . My dream collapsed just a few hours before the wedding ceremony . How could I have known that he was already married ? " <p> I nodded sympathetically . <p> " I know it makes me sound stupid , but I really loved him and believed what he told me . That 's where I went wrong . Now I do n't have him , and I do n't have my apartment . I could n't make the payments , and the bank foreclosed . " <p> " Where do you live now ? " <p> " I share a rented room with a waitress I work with . " <p> " A waitress ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowering her eyes . " I lost my job as well . My employers were sick of me being distracted , and the creditor phone calls got out of hand . I 'm waitressing now in two different restaurants . " She dried her eyes . " Today is my day off . " <p> I felt mounting rage . Cheating banks out of their money was bad enough , but cheating a trusting woman who 'd had almost nothing to begin with and was then left with even less was appalling . But more than just that , something did n't make sense . If Ward had scammed millions from U.S. banks and investors over the years , why was it worth his while to scam a secretary out of something as modest as her grandmother 's jewelry ? Where had all that money gone ? <p> I flew back from Sydney to New York . After those three long days of travel , including a layover , I went to my office and read an e-mail from David that had just come in . <p> Your report that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The FBI compared the fingerprints of Albert C. Ward III maintained in its database with prints lifted from the cup you gave the Australian Federal Police , and against subsequent prints obtained by the Australian police after you left . They told me an hour ago that the prints do n't match . The person you saw in the hospital bed is not Albert C. Ward III . The U.S. will not request his extradition . David . <p> The triumph I 'd felt on the flight from Sydney had turned out to be fleeting , and was immediately replaced with bitter disappointment . How could this have happened ? I 'd followed my hunch as well as procedure , and still failed . I 'd lost the round , but I did n't lose the lesson . I thought of a phrase from Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's poem " The Rime of the Ancient Mariner . " I was n't ready to wear my failure like an albatross around my neck . How come when I managed to pull off a task , there was nobody around , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnesses ? When I fucked up an exercise during my Mossad training , my instructor had told me sarcastically , " You have to learn from the past experiences of others , although I 'm sure you 'll find new ways to err . " It had hurt . <p> I shut the office door and collapsed into my chair , trying to figure out what to do next . I was facing a brick wall . I 'd tried to scale it and failed . <p> Should I throw in the towel ? How long do you keep digging before you concede that the well is dry ? Not here , buddy . <p> My father had taught me that while a defeat is sometimes just a temporary setback , surrender makes it permanent . I was n't there yet , far from it . I was determined to win , but how ? I would have to start again from the beginning . <p> Chapter Two Manhattan , New York , November 2003 <p> The sun would n't shine that morning , and the skies would only lighten to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clock , I could already feel it . It was six forty-five a.m. , and only the slowly fading darkness told me it was already morning . When I finally got out of bed , I instantly regretted it . There had to be a better way to start the day than waking up in the morning . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
