TECHNOLOGIES THAT provide us with the greatest benefits often also expose us to great risks . In the case of the Internet , the risk is to your privacy , your files , your identity , and your precious bandwidth . This month an expanded Internet Tips digs a little deeper into two security areas that are becoming bigger issues to all users : wireless networks and file sharing . The main drawback to a home or smallbusiness network is the wiring . That 's why wireless networking is the greatest advance since , well , the Internet . Just buy a wireless access point or router ( using either the 802.11b or the faster 802.11a wireless protocol , also known as Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi5 , respectively ) and a few wireless client cards , install them , and boom  --  you can check your e-mail at the kitchen table , in bed , or just about anywhere else within a one- or two-block radius . But therein lies the problem : Unless you 've enabled the wireless router 's security features , you may be sharing your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wireless-enabled notebook PC or PDA and a copy of NetStumbler.com 's NetStumbler software for detecting networks . ( Wireless-network infiltrators are known as war drivers ; see this month 's Privacy Watch , page 48 , to learn more about war driving . ) If your network has been insecure for a while , it may even show up in NetStumbler.com 's nationwide database of wide-open wireless networks ( go to find.pcworld.com/ 30317 to check-and look out front for parked cars filled with notebook users ) . Bandwidth theft is n't the worst part of leaving your wireless network insecure , however . A knowledgeable person can easily capture and view the contents of your wireless-network traffic , including e-mail messages and log-in passwords , or hijack your online identity for nefarious purposes , such as using your network and computers to attack other systems . Security in the current Wi-Fi versions is inherently flawed . Until the more secure 802.11i version of Wi-Fi is approved , you ca n't fully secure your network against war drivers . But by employing multiple security techniques , you can make cracking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move on to another , less secure network . Your unsecured home or office network is n't your only vulnerability , however . If the public Wi-Fi network you connect to at an airport , hotel , or coffee shop is unsecured , your passwords , e-mail , and other data are at risk . The person sitting next to you may be there for the cracking , not for the coffee . Here 's how to stay safe : Enable WEP : The 802.11b and 802.11a protocols each include an optional security element called Wireless Equivalent Privacy ( WEP ) that authenticates anyone who wants to access the wireless network , and encrypts all traffic . WEP is flawed in a number of ways that must drive the average cryptography expert right up the wall ( University of Maryland computer science professor William A. Arbaugh gathers the damning evidence at find.pcworld.com/ 30332 ) . Still , some security is better than no security . Your Wi-Fi hardware manuals will tell you how to enable WEP. // Use 128-bit WEP : Wi-Fi equipment supports WEP encryption of either 40 bits or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with WEP 's other documented flaws , makes a system easy to crack . Nota bene : To use 128-bit WEP , you must first make sure that all wireless devices on the network support it . Enabling 128-bit WEP on your entire network might justify the expense of replacing your cards that do n't support this higher-level security . Choose good pass-phrases , or go hexadecimal : Part of the process of enabling WEP is to choose a pass-phrase . Unfortunately , an easily guessed pass-phrase makes WEP even simpler to bypass . Mix upperand lowercase letters with nonalphabetic characters , do n't use real words ( including foreign ones ) , and avoid transparent tricks such as shifting your hands a key to the side , up , or down before typing an obvious password ( like password ) , or making predictable character substitutions ( such as password in place of paSSwOrd ) . Seasoned war drivers have dictionaries and other tools that run through all these tricks and permutations in no time . // FIGURE 1 : AVOID WEP pass-phrase woes by entering a hexadecimal key In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenience you can skip if you want-just make up your own hexadecimal WEP key ( a series of two-digit hex numbers ) and type it into the setup screens of your wireless router and card ( see FIGURE 1 ) . Hexadecimal ( base 16 ) numbers start with zero and use the letters A through F as singledigit equivalents of the decimal ( base 10 ) numbers 10 through 15 , yielding twodigit quantities like OB ( decimal 11 ) and FF ( decimal 255 ) . Avoid building memorable keys using hex homonyms like Al , 3D , 4F , 2B , B4-the crackers have already thought of that , and they 're looking for it . Encrypt your e-mail log-in : One way to prevent snoops from snatching your mail server password is to use one of several secure log-in methods that encrypt the password before it travels across the network to your ISP 's or company 's server . Ask tech support which method , if any , is supported ; then enable it in your e-mail program . Most support both Secure Password Authentication ( SPA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see FIGURE 2 ) . Use IPSec or a VPN : You can replace WEP altogether with one of two better-designed encryption and authentication protocols , although doing so is not for the techtimid , and if 's not cheap . IPSec is a secure version of the Internet Protocol ( IP ) networking protocol-the IP in TCP/IP . As long as both your computer and the wireless router or access point that it communicates with support IPSec , you can skip WEP . Windows XP supports IPSec ( for instructions on enabling it , choose Start . Help and Support and search for IPSec to view a list of articles on the topic ) . Though wireless routers that support IPSec also exist , that $150 unit you picked up at CompUSA probably does n't . Virtual private networks are a different technology ; a VPN creates a secure , encrypted tunnel running between your PC and a remote device ( such as a router or your firm 's mail server ) . Again , your operating system and router each need to support VPN connections ( most versions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VPNs also provide an excellent solution to the insecurity of public wireless access . Use 802. lx : Not content to wait around 10 , for the more secure 802.11i , several network product vendors support an ad hoc preliminary version called 802.1x that avoids most of WEP 's weaknesses . As with IPSec and VPNs , both your wireless access point or router and the PC that communicates with it must speak 802.1x . Windows XP supports this protocol . Install a firewall on every computer : Since the wireless network is essentially insecure , every computer on your LAN is basically unsafe . Installing one of the free firewalls mentioned earlier and setting it to allow access only to specific known machines on your network as needed ( to share a printer , for example ) will add an extra dollop of protection to keep Internet pests at bay and security at hand . // FIGURE 2 : // SHARE FILES SECURELY PROGRAMS LIKE Kazaa , Morpheus , and BearShare seem too good to be true . Free files , forever ! The legal and moral issues surrounding file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal . ( For more on this issue , see " Hollywood vs . Your PC " on page 127 . ) Still , you could inadvertently get into serious trouble using one of these programs . // FIGURE 3 : // As with Web browsing , e-mail , or any other technology that downloads files to your computer , you could contract a virus or Trojan horse that may destroy data or let someone else control your computer remotely . A recent Hewlett-Packard Labs project found that a surprising number of Kazaa users were unknowingly sharing e-mail in-boxes , browser cookies , financial data , and other personal files ( for details , see find.pcworld.com/30311 ) . To reduce your vulnerability but still search for those images and sounds , follow these steps : Skip the spyware : Most commercial filesharing tools install spyware , adware , or other bandwidth-eating , intrusive utilities you do n't want . You can usually choose to block them just by paying attention during installation . However , you can also safely remove unwanted spyware using Lavasoft 's Ad-aware ( find.pcworld.com/ 28401 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kazaa , creating an underground version called Kazaa Lite . Naturally , Kazaa 's owners are doing their best to shut him down , but you can still find and download Kazaa Lite by searching the Zeropaid.com file-sharing site . Better yet , use a noncommercial filesharing tool that does n't foist unwanted wares on you at all . My current favorite is 30314 ) , the open-source program that the current version of Morpheus is based on . Shut the barn door : Make sure you use firewall and antivirus software . Sygate 's Personal Firewall Pro and Zone Labs ' ZoneAlarm , PC World 's topranked commercial antivirus and firewall software , respectively , are both free ( for reviews , see July 's " Protect Your PC " at find.pcworld.com/27361 ) . Do n't share private files : Your file-sharing program creates default upload and download directories . If you dislike the default file-sharing folder location , make another one , but keep it separate from your personal data files ( see FIGURE 3 ) . And remember : You 're sharing not just the shared folder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are truly paranoid ( a good thing , in my opinion ) can disable file uploads completely . Do n't download viruses : In general , you wo n't receive a virus from sharing a file if you stick to downloading standard text , image , audio , and video file formats . Your file-sharing program may include filtering to block the download of dangerous types , including . exe , . vbs , and . scr . Archive files-those ending with the zip , . rar , sit , or . arj extension , for example  --  are n't inherently unsafe but still can contain just about anything , including a virus- or Trojan horse-laden file . Sidebar DOWNLOAD OF THE MONTH SpamNet : The Napster of Outlook Spam Blocking Sidebar WHEN IT COMES to eradicating spam , no one tool or technique is best . PC World recently recommended McAfee 's SpamKiller ( find.pcworld.com/27424 ) as the best all-around antispam utility , in part because it works with a variety of e-mail programs . Nick Bolton 's MailWasher ( $20 donation requested ; find.pcworld.com/ 30335 ) helps you nuke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both are excellent tools , but I sometimes long for a spam eater that does its job without requiring my personal attention . Cloudmark 's free SpamNet ( find.pcworld. com/30336 ) may be the answer . The program works exclusively with Microsoft Outlook 2000 and XP ( the company says Outlook Express compatibility is on the way ) . It requires that you first download mail to fry spam , but it managed to find nearly every unsolicited commercial email message that I received over the course of a few days . When it occasionally misses one , I select the message and then click the Block button that SpamNet places in Outlook 's toolbar . Conversely , to move back to my in-box the few nonspam messages that SpamNet mistakenly adds to my Spam folder , I simply click the Unblock button . Blocked and unblocked spam is fed back into Cloudmark 's database of known spam messages , improving the overall detection accuracy for everyone using the program . It 's the antispam equivalent of Napster .
