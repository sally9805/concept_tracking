. From Bayliner , a sturdy new cruiser that can take you the distance on a single engine : the Discovery 246 . AS CRUISES GO , THIS ONE HAD ALL THE ELEMENTS of a real adventure : running offshore for long distances ; exposure to the inevitable changes in wind and water conditions ; and desirable ports of call . Yet we made this big trip in what some would call a small boat , a 25-footer . My ride was the Bayliner Discovery 246 hardtop cruiser , the place was the Southern California coast from San Diego to Santa Barbara , about 170 nautical miles of coastline infamous for accelerating afternoon winds and rough water . The cruise gave me the opportunity to evaluate this stout new single-engine cruiser , which replaces Bayliner 's popular 242 Classic , a boat that 's been in the line for over 15 years . Along for the ride was another boat carrying a film crew that was on hand to videotape our adventure for a Webisode broadcast ( see www.motorboating.com for more details ) . We cleared Point Loma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . On our way out to the sea buoy , I was watching an Aegis class cruiser well out to sea when the sail of a partially submerged submarine appeared and then seemed to turn toward the harbor . We immediately turned NNW and began our uphill ( against the southerly current ) run toward Avalon on Catalina Island . The Discovery 246 was equipped with an optional 300-hp MerCruiser 350 MAG MPI engine and Bravo Three sterndrive that , according to the manufacturer , would burn 13.2 gph at a cruising speed of 27.6 knots for a range of 152 nautical miles . At that speed , we could make the trip of roughly 70 nautical miles from the sea buoy to Avalon in just under three hours . But then the wind gods blew 10 to 12 mph out of the SSW , stirring up three- to four-foot waves . Needless to say , we slowed our passage to 20 knots and arrived at our destination almost five hours later . Along the way , I regularly checked our position on the Navman Tracker chartplotter against the Maptech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinette table inside . Even though conditions were bumpy , the dimensions of the well-lit cabin made going below a pleasure . It was August , so the harbor at Avalon was packed , although we were able to rent a mooring . We hailed one of the launches for a ride to the town dock and headed ashore . There are many restaurants , gift shops and inns in this quaint town ; most are concentrated near the harbor as the streets climb steeply up into the hills . Residents use golf carts to get around , although there are some privately owned cars  --  and a 15-year waiting list if you want to import one . Rather than spend the night on board , we found two rooms at the Avalon Hotel and cleaned up for dinner at the Catalina Country Club , a restaurant in an open courtyard with excellent food that was once the spring training clubhouse for the Chicago Cubs . A jazz quartet provided the background music . The stars overhead promised clear weather for tomorrow 's short run up to Two Harbors at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At Two Harbors , a destination popular with cruisers who want a change from the busy pace of Avalon , we rented kayaks and camping gear , and then took a breathtaking tour by Hummer from sea level up to 1,802 feet to see some of the American Bison that roam the interior of the island . Later , Doug Odin , vice president of harbor operations , gave us a tour of the anchorages to the west , including the stunning waters of Emerald Bay . That night , we camped out on the beach with the sound of surf rolling in . The experience reminded me that cruising boats like the Discovery 246 make it easier for people to find and enjoy beautiful places . On the third day of the cruise , we powered up to East Anacapa Island , which is part of the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary , all the while keeping watch for the commercial ships that regularly pass between the islands and Santa Barbara . We had hoped to go ashore to explore the Anacapa lighthouse , but the afternoon wind piped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That changed our plans to anchor out . Yet even with the sloppy seas , the Discovery held its own . We set the throttle to run at a steady 18 knots and powered on past the offshore drilling platforms until we reached the shelter of Santa Barbara Harbor . Chuck Thompson of Bayliner was aboard the other boat for the duration of the trip . He said the Discovery would occasionally disappear from sight as the gusty winds lifted spray from the waves that we simply could n't avoid . Yet not once did I get wet . One of the best features on the Discovery 246 is the hardtop , which extends well aft of the helm and companion seats and has a drop curtain . Having run the Bayliner for a long distance and for three days , I can attest to the fact that a hardtop cruiser like this one makes it possible to keep on boating when conditions get sloppy and the warm days of summer begin to wane . When properly equipped , the Discovery 246 is an all-season cruiser for anyone with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( w/test power ) : $54,579 LOA ( W/SWIM PLATFORM ) : 25 ' 8 " BEAM : 8 ' 6 " FUEL : 81 GALS .

Please see hardcopy of magazine or PDF . BOX HOT 1 Outstanding protection and visibility on the bridgedeck. 2 Great headroom and layout in the cabin for a family of four . 3 Good galley and general storage for a weekend cruise . 4 Drop-down aft bench and cockpit storage are well done . NOT 1 Why no overhead rail beneath the hardtop ? 2 There should be more clearance between forward and aft-facing seats . 3 Indicators for drive trim and tabs would be helpful . 4 One more handrail per side to assist transit from cockpit to sidedeck .
