We know what you 're thinking : Secret hikes in the Whites ? Have n't been any secrets there since Cal Coolidge was president . Think again . We blew the dust off old maps and hiked into the farthest-flung corners of three wilderness areas to bring you six fresh backpacking trips and dayhikes .

" So began the January 1 , 1876 invitation from MIT Professor Edward Pickering to an exclusive list of Boston academics that launched the Appalachian Mountain Club . Few trails to major summits existed prior to 1876 , but by 1925 the AMC was maintaining 300 trail miles and 14 shelters .

Marooned in Northeast alpine zones after the last Ice Age , many found in the Whites grow in few other places . Flowers like diapensia , lapland rosebay , and alpine azalea tend to be small and dark , which helps them survive cold , wind , and a short growing season . The best spots to see them are Mt . Washington 's Alpine Garden , Bigelow Lawn , and Lakes of the Clouds . New England 's rarest alpine plant , the dwarf cinquefoil , has small green leaves and yellow , five-petal flowers and is found only on Mt . Washington and Franconia Ridge .

Thornton resident Cath Goodwin has hiked all 48 peaks in a single winter-four times . Ed Hawkins of Chester last February completed his goal of hiking a peak on every day of the year . Moose If you do n't see a moose up here , it 's not their fault . The Granite State 's Alces alces population has exploded in the past 20 years ; estimates put their numbers near 10,000 . The largest member of the deer family , moose may measure 6 feet tall at the shoulder .
