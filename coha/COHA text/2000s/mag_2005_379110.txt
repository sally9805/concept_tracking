It was my first interview with the President , and I expected a simple " Hello " when I walked into the Oval Office last December . Instead , George W. Bush joked , " Cooper ! I thought you 'd be in jail by now . " The leader of the free world , it seems , had been following my fight against a federal subpoena seeking my testimony in the case of the leaking of the name of a CIA officer . I thought it was funny and good-natured of the President , but the line reminded me that I was , very weirdly , in the Oval Office , out on bond from a prison sentence , awaiting appeal  --  in large part , for protecting the confidence of someone in the West Wing . " What can I say , Mr. President , " I replied , smiling . " The wheels of justice grind slowly . " <P> After a fight that went all the way to the Supreme Court , the wheels of justice have stopped grinding  --  for me , anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigating the leak . I did so after I received a specific last-minute waiver from one of my sources , Karl Rove , the President 's top political adviser , releasing me from any claim of confidentiality he might have about our conversations in July 2003 . Under federal law grand jurors and prosecutors are sworn to secrecy but those who testify , like me , are under no such obligation , which is why I 'm able to tell you what happened in the grand jury room . Patrick Fitzgerald , the special counsel , told me that he would prefer that I not discuss the matter , and I suspect he said the same thing to White House officials who are now treating his request as a command and refusing to comment on the case . I do n't know if I can illuminate this confounding investigation , but I can at least explain my small part in it . Like the blindfolded man and the elephant , all I know is what seems to be in front of me . <P> So here 's what happened last Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9:30 a.m. , my lawyers and I met briefly with Fitzgerald , a couple of his attorneys and the lead FBI agent in the case . It was , to say the least , unsettling sitting there in the federal courthouse in Washington with the man who , for months , had tried to get me to testify or he would put me in jail . Fitzgerald counseled me that he wanted me to answer completely but did n't want to force any answers on me or have me act as if I remembered things more clearly than I did . " If I show you a picture of your kindergarten teacher and it really refreshes your memory , say so , " he said . " If it does n't , do n't say yes just because I show you a photo of you and her sitting together . "
