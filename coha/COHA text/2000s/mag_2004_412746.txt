// THINK about it . When was the last time that you focused on yourself ? When did you last take a moment to do a wellness check of your mind , body and spirit ? If you 're like the millions of women who are on the gograbbing for the brass ring , focusing on the family or trying to shatter that glass ceiling-it 's past time for you to take a step back and concentrate on finding the real you . Those who 've mastered the mind-body-spirit connection say that it 's essential , particularly in today 's stressful society , to take care of yourself . Black women can have it all , experts say , with a bit of planning , pacing and putting self first every once in a while . ( Men should take heed as well . ) " What happens , for Black women in particular , is that we get somewhat dislocated when dealing with the everyday Stressors of life-spiritual , physical and social , " says Sigrid Kennebrew , a licensed psychologist and president of Diverse Counseling &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it affects our states of mind to the point that our lives ca n't be in harmony . " One solution , says Kennebrew , who holds a doctorate in psychology from the University of Georgia , is to focus on spending time with yourself , either in meditation or in prayer-no TV , personal digital assistant or cell phoneevery day . That 's a practice that Bishop Vashti Murphy McKenzie of Baltimore maintains . She became the first female bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in 2000 , and somehow balances her husband and children with a demanding professional life . McKenzie says that too often people do n't admit that they ca n't do it all and have it all at the same time . The hectic pace we set for our lives builds up an almost unbearable pressure and " creates a kind of pain " within us that is difficult to heal without a real commitment to living differently . She suggests focusing on what you can do and what you ca n't do in order to maintain your personal boundaries . " For me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my spiritual life . I practice a daily sabbatical , where I pull away emotionally and mentally , in prayer and quiet time , so that not only can I share God , but I can also hear myself think , " says McKenzie , author of Journey to the Well : 12 Lessons to Personal Transformation . " It 's during this daily sabbatical that I have an opportunity to prioritize , by taking a look at what I need to do and what things I need to delegate to others .

Photograph Focusing on the whole you , particularly the physical self , can prevent , experts say , the onset of preventable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. // Another way to keep mind , body and spirit together is through relationships , says Chicagoan Winifred Scott . An organizational consultant with a doctorate in philosophy , Dr. Scott says that her friends and family are key pieces in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says she could not achieve the balance that is so necessary for her well-being . She meditates and prays daily and occasionally visits the spa . But that is n't always necessary . Dr. Scott says she is often able to go on mini-retreats without ever leaving the comfort of her own home . Instilling that practice within yourself is necessary , Dr. Scott says , because there 's a very " thin line " between living a healthy life and allowing stress and pressure to control your life . " I can see deterioration when I do n't maintain a balance , " Dr. Scott says . " When I do n't keep mind , body and spirit together , I get depressed . You have to have an anchor . " The body component of the mind-body-spirit mix often is the most neglected . The level of obesity in America has reached epidemic levels , bringing with it increased health care costs , more preventable diseases and rising levels of depression , experts say . Rovenia M. Brock , Ph.D. , a nutritionist and author of Dr. Ro 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to realize the connection between physical health-the body-and mental and spiritual health . At times , we tend to lose focus in one area , and that creates a domino effect where other areas of our lives are thrown out of balance . If you do n't know how to fix it , experts say , it can begin a cycle of self-abuse that is difficult to break . " The very first step is to make up your mind that you 're going to live a different life , " says Dr. Brock , who lives in Washington , D.C. , with her husband . " You 're going to change the way you think about your life . As nurturers and caregivers , Black women have made whole lives of taking care of everybody else . Overall , it 's about making up your mind that , to some extent , your life is going to be about you . " The Rev. Dr. Suzan D. Johnson Cook made that important decision a few years ago . She was handling the responsibilities that came with pastoring her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 people a day-every day . It was go-time all the time , and she could n't stop . Eventually , she decided to take a sabbatical-against the advice of her peers who thought she might lose her job-because , as she puts it , " I did n't want to lose me . " Now a best-selling author and senior pastor of Bronx Christian Fellowship , Dr. Cook says she practices what she preaches , that mind , body and spirit must flow together for us to be whole . That connection , she says , is one of the priorities that can lead to a more pleasurable existence . Rev. Cook believes that you have to stop and take a look at your real life-not the fairy tale that you want your life to be-so that you can make wise decisions , unclouded by stress , exhaustion and other people 's expectations . " One definition of recreation is re-creation , " says Dr. Cook , whose latest book is Balancing Your Life : God 's Plan for Hope and a Future .
