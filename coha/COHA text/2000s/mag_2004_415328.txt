Accounting regulators want $1 trillion or more of hidden corporate debt moved into plain view . The reform could pull the rug from under the credit-driven economy . <p> For all the evils at Enron et al . And the damage done to America 's faith in the markets , the worst impact may be on its way  --  from some of the fixes that regulators and politicians are now pursuing . Who knows whether the inevitable crackdowns on options or accounting firm consultants will sap incentives and productivity ? We 're talking about a more obscure , but potentially far more devastating , change in accounting . It has to do with securitized lending . If it 's implemented , it could throw a giant monkey wrench into a weak economy . <p> Securitization describes a form of financing in which a bank or other lender wraps up a package of assets  --  car loans , for example , or mortgages or credit card receivables  --  and issues securities against that package . ( The securities are traded as bonds ; hence the " securitizing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy those securities . That provides cash that lenders can recycle in another round of car loans , mortgages and credit card charges . <p> Such financial alchemy keeps America 's buy-now-pay-later consumers swimming in credit . It helps explain why , despite two years of layoffs and 401(k) disasters , people are buying cars and houses at a furious pace . Securitized lending has its antecedents in Ginnie Mae , created in 1968 to package home mortgages . In the past decade it took off , having climbed to a staggering total of $6 trillion , most of it to finance consumers . For comparison , all household debt in the U.S. totals $7.7 trillion . <p> With the right attention to detail , the lender securitizing its book of car loans or credit card balances gets both the stream of income from assets ( that is , the consumer loans ) and virtually all the liabilities ( the securities issued to investors ) off its balance sheet . The investors are thrilled with the arrangement . They can look to a predictable stream of consumer loan repayments to back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lender gets into trouble , they get first dibs on that cash stream . For lenders , keeping these assets and liabilities buried in footnotes rather than on the balance sheet is vital . Consolidate them and some lenders would look dangerously leveraged . <p> Securitization is a big business for some finance companies . Citigroup has $204 billion of asset-backed debt outstanding , J.P . Morgan Chase $75 billion . Credit-card issuer MBNA , a master of the art , has $73 billion  --  compared to on-balance-sheet assets of $45.4 billion and a comparative sliver of shareholders ' equity , $7.8 billion . Ford Motor Credit was able to save several hundred million dollars over the past 18 months using off-balance-sheet financing . GMAC is another big player . Without securitization you might not see as many 0% car loans . <p> What could stop this happy arrangement ? Enron-wary reformers are agitating to have some or all of that $6 trillion consolidated on the balance sheets of lenders . Some lenders are fighting this tooth and nail . It would force a lot of them to raise the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It could , if you believe the people lobbying against the reform proposal , stop the economic recovery in its tracks . <p> Investors are already hesitant to provide all the credit this economy needs , says bond manager Paul McCulley , who has 5% of the Pimco Short-Term Fund parked in asset-backed securities . " A period of rising risk aversion is the worst time to tighten the rules , " he says . A worst-case outcome of the accounting change : a credit meltdown , with " everyone trying to sell at the same time . " <p> Andrew Smithers , chairman of Smithers &Co.,; economic consultants in London , warns , " If they have to put the debt back on their balance sheets , it will violate the debt covenants of leading banks . " If banks ' balance sheets lard up with the extra debt , " banks will have less propensity to lend in similar size and pricing . It will diminish the return on equity , " says Michael Malter , head of asset-backed securities at J.P . Morgan Chase . <p> <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the rule change in the fourth quarter , dismisses all the hand-wringing . " We 're trying to increase transparency and disclosure on the financial statements . If the markets or regulators think that consolidating all the debt is being overleveraged , I ca n't control that , " says Edward Trott , a member of the seven-person board . <p> FASB just got some more ammunition for its reform campaign . The Securities &; Exchange Commission accused PNC Financial Services , the big Pittsburgh bank , of inflating income last year by hiding loan losses in off-balance-sheet entities . PNC agreed on July 18 to consolidate the entities in question without admitting or denying charges . Presumably , if FASB gets its way and banks have to consolidate some or all of their off-balance-sheet entities , it will be harder to hide any problems . No bank examiner or securities cop wants to be blamed for the next Enron . <p> For now FASB is targeting only one portion of securitization , amounting to $1 trillion or so of off-balance-sheet debt . Consolidation would be mandatory whenever the parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trust ) that holds the assets and floats the securities . If , in contrast , the trust is on autopilot  --  if assets are assigned to it according to prearranged rules , and if the parent has no say in when the trust is liquidated  --  then it would escape consolidation . <p> Who would get hit ? It appears that a portion of asset-backed securities issued by banks would be consolidated . Same goes for Ford Motor Credit , GMAC and the financing arms of Boeing , Sears and other retailers . <p> Who would escape ? MBNA , for sure . It has skillfully set up its trust of credit card receivables to put it at arm 's length from the parent company . Among other things , MBNA is not on the hook if the trust , despite its ample dose of collateral , winds up bankrupt . <p> FASB 's opponents fear that the pending rule is only the opening wedge in a frontal assault that will eventually force all off-balance-sheet entities out into the open . After all , distinctions having to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cares what the legal mechanism is for liquidating a trust ? In economic substance , just about all of the entities that securitize assets are the alter egos of their parent companies . If the assets do well  --  if the cars do n't wind up with the repo man , if the credit cards mostly stay out of the hands of deadbeats  --  the parent does well . If the assets do badly , the parent suffers through the reduced payout from the trust 's income . Investors would n't want it any other way . If the parent were genuinely indifferent to the financial results of the trust , it would put in all its worst assets and walk away . <p> Moody 's , the credit rater , does n't make FASB 's distinction between controlled and independent trusts . Looking at the economic substance of what is going on , it adds off-balance-sheet debt back onto the main balance sheet to determine the parent company 's credit rating . MBNA gets a Baa2 rating and would have 93% debt and only 7% equity if the MBNAMaster Credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liabilities . Note , though , that the credit card trust itself gets an Aaa for the most senior tranche of its paper . That translates into a low cost of borrowing for MBNA , and thus into profits for MBNA shareholders . Since MBNA went public in early 1991 , its stock has climbed elevenfold . <p> It is a credit to the skill of the financial engineers setting up these securities-issuing entities that few have blown up . " The extent of credit defaults on securitized debt is far less than with unsecured corporate debt , " says Tanya Azarchs , a credit analyst at Standard &Poor's.; <p> Case in point : An off-balance-sheet vehicle of J.P . Morgan Chase called Park Avenue Securities took part in a $1.5 billion receivables-backed financing earlier this year to WorldCom  --  as bad a bet as any bank could make . When WorldCom confessed to doctored accounts , Park Avenue and other financiers were able to demand extra collateral from WorldCom ( in the form of WorldCom 's own receivables , owed by phone customers ) . J.P . Morgan Chase expects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss . <p> That kind of insulation has impressed even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , who said publicly in April : " A major contributor to the dispersion of risk has been the wide-ranging development of markets in securitized commercial and residential mortgages , bank loans and credit card receivables . ... Shocks to the overall economic system are accordingly less likely to create cascading credit failure . " <p> " The ability to securitize has made a significant contribution to the world economy , " says Vernon Wright , 59 , chief corporate finance officer at MBNA and architect of its credit card trust . " There is n't a need to change the existing accounting for securitizations . " <p> From his point of view there is n't , but the public mood is hostile to anything that has " off balance sheet " in its name . Under the circumstances , securitizers should take the precaution of assuming that the FASB rule will go through . <p> Money Machine <p> MBNA earns over 50% on income from its off-balance-sheet portfolio , collecting a 2% servicing fee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> By Robert Lenzner and Matthew Swibel <p>
