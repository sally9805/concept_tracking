Richard Chwedyk introduced us to the amiable saurs in our January 2001 issue and followed it with " Bronte 's Egg " in our August 2002 issue . You need not have read either of the two previous stories to enjoy this one , but if you have read them , well , you 're probably going to ignore these header notes and rush right into the story anyway , so let 's not even finish this thought . Lower the drawbridge and enter Tibor 's castle ... and behold what lies within ! <p> TIBOR STEPPED OUT OF HIS cardboard box and walked to the edge of the desk . " Tibor 's universe ! " he declared , as if he had recently been challenged on this point . The desk on which the box sat was right up against the window in the second floor " workroom " of the old neo-Victorian house where the saurs lived . There were two other desks in the room : one in the corner near the door , where Preston worked at his keyboard and display screen ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Geraldine 's desk , on which her cardboard box sat , her " lab . " Tibor spoke as if making a general proclamation , but he stared straight at Geraldine 's lab . " Tibor 's universe ! " - more as if claiming authorship than ownership . Across the room , through the little doorway cut from the cardboard , one could see lights flickering and shivering like a miniature thunderstorm inside Geraldine 's lab - until Tibor spoke . The lights stopped . Geraldine stuck her head out , smiling as if pleased with a very private joke - a joke that was on everyone else . She walked slowly but directly to the edge of her desk . " My universe , " she said in a voice that was , as usual , barely audible : that made you doubt you 'd heard it at all , except that you heard it so clearly . Her reply was confident , and it was more than a challenge : it was a gauntlet . " Tibor 's universe , " Tibor replied firmly . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person-and he insisted on pronouncing the first syllable to rhyme with " eye " and the second to rhyme with " saur . " No force of logic or dictionary citation could convince him otherwise . They stood there , at the edges of their desks , as if the room was a valley between them . They were both about the same size , which was small - designed to look like the great apatosaurs of the Jurassic Era ( in a cartoonish sort of way , and their tails , alas , were short and stumpy ) , but each could just about fit in your open hand , from the heel of your palm to the end of your fingers . Geraldine waited until Tibor looked ready to rear back in a moment of triumph . And then she said : " Geraldine 's universe . " Tibor scowled at Geraldine - but he always scowled . His brows were permanently knit . He inhaled as if the force of his breath would strengthen the force of his words . " Tibor 's universe ! " His voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by much . Not only did it have that same diffuse quality , but a certain tinniness too , a slightly artificial edge , as if he had taken elocution lessons from a voice synthesizer . Geraldine paused a little longer , like an orchestra conductor exaggerating the rest before a coda . " Geraldine 's " - without change in pitch or volume . A brief but distinctly visible shudder ran through Tibor . " Tibor 's ! " His name hung in the space between the desks like a tiny puff of smoke with an exclamation point attached to it - Until it was answered by " Geraldine 's , " - and the little puff disintegrated . " Tiber 's ! " " Geraldine 's . " " Tiboi 's ! " " Geraldine 's . " As much as they argued over it , the universe seemed very far away from them - it might as well have been an errant checker that had fallen off the board and rolled into a corner . But if the universe was far away , it was not quite out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed at the distraction . The dark green theropod , who had a somewhat rounder and larger head than most tyrannosaurs , was for once not working on one of his novels , but reading over a list of questions submitted to him by a graduate student . This graduate student wanted to know about his life , his influences , his writing habits and his " personal philosophy . " That last part was the most troublesome . He knew the answers to the other questions , though he was n't sure he was ready to share them . What would happen if his readers knew that the eight novels written by " Ellis Lawrence Cartwright " were the work of a tyrannosaurid no more than half a meter tall who was manufactured in the factory/lab of a toy company ? Who now lived in an old house out past the sprawl of a great megalopolis with a hundred-odd other " saurs " ? By rights , he should n't exist at all , much less have written eight novels . But that last question : his " philosophy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say what it was . And the duel going on between Tibor and Geraldine would n't bring him any closer to an answer . On the floor , in the center of the room , Agnes watched over everyone and everything . She was a gray stegosaurus , about forty centimeters long , and if the universe was created by Tibor , or Geraldine , or " some other idiot " ( as she would have put it ) , Agnes was its guardian and its judge , self-appointed . And , hearing the exchange between Geraldine and Tibor , she was not pleased . " They do it to annoy me , " she muttered to her mate , Sluggo , a slightly smaller gray stegosaur who stood next to her . " Just to annoy me ! " " Agnes ? " Sluggo spoke apprehensively . It had been his job for years to calm his mate and reassure her , and it never deterred him that at this one job he had consistently failed . " I do n't think they even know you 're here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " They know ! They know damn well who 's here ! " A small hadrosaur named Ace rode around the room on a shoe-sized , battery-powered contraption called a " skate , " which many of the little ones used to get around what was for them a leviathan of a house . " Hey ! " Agnes called to him . " Slow that thing down ! You might hurt someone ! " Ace pretended not to hear her and skated one more circuit of the room before rolling out the door . He also pretended not to hear the battle between Geraldine and Tibor above him . To Agnes 's right , a short , somewhat owlish theropod with a down turned snout named Alphonse had gathered an audience : the triceratops couple , Charlie and Rosie , and two other stegosaurs named Elliot and Veronica . Alphonse listened to a tiny digital radio with a pocket phone at the ready , waiting for the ImpacNewzRadio Daily Trivia Question . If he could answer today 's question correctly he would set a new record . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the possessives of two proper names . But Charlie looked up at Tibor , who from that angle was backlit by the early summer afternoon sunlight - a silhouette , tiny and severe . " When do you think they 'll stop ? " he whispered to Rosie . " Geraldine , " Rosie whispered back , " will stop him . " In general , the other saurs tried , really tried , not to pay any attention to Graldine and Tibor , or anything that happened on those two desks , with their cardboard boxes . It had been so since they first arrived . Before he was brought to the house , Tibor arrived at an Atherton Foundation office in a cat carrier with several other saurs , in the custody of a bewildered , flustered woman who found them scrabbling with squirrels and robins for the contents of her feeder . Tibor wore a little green plastic " something " on his head - it could have been a very large , rimmed thimble , if such a thing existed , or a doll-house-sized flower pot-he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had a tiny children 's picture book : I Am a Big Dinosaur- " Tiber 's book . " Geraldine , on the other hand , was brought right up to the doorstep in the middle of the night - like a foundling or a terrorist 's bomb - by someone who managed to elude detection by the Reggiesystem security protocols . That " someone " also left a note , written in a very shaky hand : GERALDINE . PLEASE BE CAREFUL . That was as much as anyone knew about them previous to their arrival at the house . Tiber 's cardboard box was big , like the ones used to ship large electronic devices . It was hard to say what it had originally contained : all the printing and manufacturer 's logos on the box had been scribbled out and replaced with a terse , angry scrawl of a name TIBOR ! PROPERTY OF TIBOR ! KEEP OUT ! TIBOR 'S ! Above the little cut-out doorway , printed in much smaller , but still adamant , lettering : TIBOR 'S CASTLE . In truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battlements , no towers , no walls , no moat . No effort had been made even to draw those elements on the surface and make it seem more castle-like by some trompe l'oeil effect . But the other saurs thought of it as a castle and nothing else . That point was established one night when the saurs - big and small - were gathered in front of the video in the parlor , watching one of the artifacts of the former century : a movie called Citizen Kane , considered quite a masterpiece in its time . As they watched the beginning , with its image of the shadowy castle on the hilltop of the Xanadu estate , all behind the ominous No TRESPASSING sign on the wrought iron fence , Symphony Syd - a stegosaur not prone to exclamations , or even whispers - squeaked out in recognition , " Tibor ! " The other saurs understood perfectly . Not for any physical resemblance , but when they looked up at Tibor 's " castle , " very often with Tibor glaring down at them , they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really frighten them . He was a runt when you came down to it . His Beethovian scowl was more likely to inspire laughter or unease , but never fear . He could worry them , though . He could even worry the human , Tom Groverton , who also lived in the house and took care of the saurs . Dr. Margaret Pagliotti , the human who came every week to check on their health , might also worry over Tibor , when he stood in his castle entrance , staring up at her and declaring , " Tibor chooses not ! " at the prospect of a bath ( a bath which he received all the same ) . Tom once described the feeling as knowing that a carbonated pop bottle had been shaken vigorously then put back in with the other bottles , so you no longer knew which bottle was going to spray you when you opened it . Tibor , of course , seemed to interpret their expressions otherwise . As much as anyone could guess at the workings of the mind of Tibor , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tibor saw awe , and reverence , and deference . In Tibor 's reckoning ( to the extent that he declared it ) , he was the unrecognized , misunderstood genius . Tibor the thinker . Tibor the bold leader . The aesthetic innovator . The brilliant strategist . Tibor : lonesome , rejected outcast , embittered , unbroken ! The saurs tried not to reckon him at all . Not because they did n't like him , but when they did , he recruited them into the Great Tiborian Army , the Tiborian Council or , when he felt especially generous , into the Knights of Tibor . Or he would often try to appropriate anything he desired from the other saurs by boldly walking up to them and claiming possession of it : " Tibor 's corn ! " " Tibor 's ribbon ! " Or , if he desired possession emphatically : " Tibor 's imperial skate ! " " Tibor 's universe ! " - insistent , like a fiery pianist whose every finger hammered the same , single note . Alphonse pressed closer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airline crashes in Kentucky and downturns in the stock market . Preston closed his eyes . The sentence he had been forming in reply to the graduate student shrank into one word : " Patience . " Geraldine paused just long enough to move Tibor from the simmer to the boil . " Geraldine 's . " " Tibor 's ! " Geraldine smiled , as usual , to herself . The box behind her also had all its markings crossed out , but there was only one word that replaced all the writing and logos . One word - DANGER ! All it took to brighten her smile was to look at that word . Neatly drawn beneath it were a saurian skull and a pair of crossed femurs . There was another old film that evinced from the saurs a degree of recognition when they viewed it : The Biide of Frankenstein . It was Kincaid , a squirrel-sized bright yellow corythosaur , who whispered the name " Geraldine " upon seeing the mad doctor 's laboratory with all its strange devices . The screen flickered with lightning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shudders , as thunderstorms - or the name Geraldine - always did . They knew somehow that - as they trembled down in the parlor , watching this frightening tableau - Geraldine was up on the second floor , in her lab , smiling . Tom Groverton kept two fire extinguishers in the workroom , close to Geraldine 's lab , which seemed a sensible precaution . In the medieval days of humans , children were born of whom it was said that " their eyes were too bright " and that they bore " a look too uncanny . " They were considered " devil 's children , " not really human at all , and they were often killed or banished to save the village from destruction and damnation . Those were days of superstition and barbarism . The new century was , at least ostensibly , an age of reason and pragmatism . No one wished to harm Geraldine , or at least no one would admit to it . If Tibor might make one feel uneasy on occasion , Geraldine could bring on waves of anxieties within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Downstairs in the parlor , at that very moment , Tyrone and Alfie , two inseparable little theropods , were telling Doc that Alfie saw Geraldine floating in the air once . Doc was a beige tyrannosaur , about fifty centimeters tall when he stood up straight - which was difficult , since he had a " tricky " left leg . His thick brows made it look as if he were always squinting , though you could just make out a twinkle in his eyes as he smiled at the little ones . " A dream , no doubt , " Doc told them . " I 've dreamt of Geraldine myself - a dream where I 'm running for my life , faster than I 've ever- " Alfie shook his head . He never spoke except to whisper into Tyrone 's ear . " Alfie says it was n't a dream . Everyone was still at breakfast , and he came back to the workroom . Geraldine was floating . " " Well . " Doc looked at Alfie . " I did see once on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic - clear as glass - that rides on the static electricity in the air like a kite rides on the breezes . Very popular with the children . Perhaps Geraldine 's acquired a small piece of that substance , and you saw her riding on that . " Alfie , himself no bigger than Tibor or Geraldine , looked up at Doc with his perfectly round , dark eyes , then whispered some more into Tyrone 's ear . " Alfie says she was n't riding . She was floating . " Doc leaned forward and gently placed his forepaw on Alfie 's head . " Perhaps . Anything within reason is possible . " He looked over at the other saurs in the parlor , engaged in a game called Not So Hard , using their tails to flick checkers like little hockey pucks across the wooden floor . " Or without reason , I suppose . " Back upstairs , Tibor hammered away while Geraldine lengthened her pauses to frustrate her opponent further . " Tibor 's ! " " Geraldine 's . " " It 's torture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight and clicked together in her agitation . " They 're torturing us ! " " Agnes , please , " said Sluggo . Preston 's reply to the graduate student evaporated into " Patience " for the third time . Alphonse turned up the volume on his little radio . His companions tried not to look up at either desk . But there were two other saurs in the room whose attention was fixed on the duel above . Their heads moved as they shifted their attention from one apatosaur to the other - as if they were watching a tennis match . One of them was Axel , a blue theropod who stood about thirty centimeters tall when he craned his neck . He had a long scar down his back - healed for many years but still visible . His eyes were opened wide and he let his jaw drop down so that the pink insides of his mouth and all his thorny white teeth were visible . He was fascinated with the exchange between Geraldine and Tibor , though he had no idea what provoked it or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . It was the energy that fascinated him , the activity . It was like watching the humans who brought the food supplies every week : they went to the back of the truck and unloaded another box , and then another , and then another . The momentary idea that the action could be repeated into infinity was intoxicating and almost addictive . No matter whose universe it was , it threatened to become nothing more than these two names , Geraldine and Tibor , bouncing back and forth forever . To Axel , the possibility was horrifying , and for that reason it was also hypnotic . And exhilarating . Next to Axel stood a small pink apatosaur - smaller even than Geraldine or Tibor . Her name was Guinevere . That was not the first thing she was called , but it was what she was called now . The first thing she was called ( by Axel , it so happened ) was " Gack ! " because that was the first sound she made when she hatched from her egg . It was a momentous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No saur in the house had ever been born from an egg before - or even " born " in any other imaginable way . No one even knew it was possible until it happened . Bronte , a dark green cat-sized apatosaur , was the mother and she decided ( with a little help from Agnes ) that " Gack ! " was not an appropriate name for such a special creature . Axel 's second choice for a name was Lancelot , since Lancelot had been his buddy many years before , and Axel had been thinking about him a lot just then . But that name was voted down too - as it seemed to all the assembled saurs that the hatchling belonged to another gender how they could tell her gender was not discussed ) . The name Guinevere was suggested by Hetman , a blind , limbless theropod so crippled he was confined to a little bed that had been wheeled over to the hatching so that , unable to see it , he could listen to the event . Bronte liked the name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for herself . " She is Guinevere . " Time confirmed the appropriateness of Hetman 's choice . Guinevere was treated like a princess , especially by her mother . Great things were expected of her : a saur who had been born , in a sense , not manufactured . A saur who had never had to suffer the indignities of being purchased , treated like a toy , and often abused . She was a creature free of the saurs " past . Guinevere was the future . And Axel formed a special relationship with her . Axel helped bring her into the world when he " invented " the robot Rotomotoman , a metal cylinder capped with a hemisphere that held two rolling eyes the size of tea saucers , and duly equipped with arm-like appendages and four small wheels . He ( Rotomotoman was rarely referred to as " it " ) stood in a corner of the workroom , attentive , and for the moment facing Geraldine and Tibor . The names " Geraldine " and " Tibor " flipped back and forth almost casually on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product of sheer creative will on Axel 's part and a great deal of assistance from Axel 's fellow saurs ( and the Reggiesystem computer that so greatly aided in the operation of the house ) . He had dreamed of Rotomotoman and would n't rest until Rotomotoman had been built . Only after Rotomotoman 's eyes lighted with a kind of mechanical consciousness , and he had rolled along the floor of the house on his four little wheels , was it discovered that he also possessed a little drawer secreted in his cylindrical torso - an incubator , perfect for saurian eggs . The first egg ever placed in the drawer was Bronte 's , and from that egg Guinevere emerged . Axel , therefore , could consider himself as a kind of uncle , or godfather . He thought of himself as Guinevere 's " buddy . " Bronte often spent the afternoons reading to Hetman in the library . Sometimes Guinevere stayed with her . At other times Guinevere went off with Axel - which Bronte allowed with a little worry and only if Agnes stayed nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world he knew and the world he imagined he knew , which was much bigger than the old house . What troubled Bronte about this arrangement was that Axel found it difficult to get his facts together coherently , if he resorted to facts at all . " The first thing the world did was blow up , " Axel told Guinevere . " That 's called the Big Bang ! Everything flew out of the Big Bang and it 's been flying around ever since ! You look outside at night and see all those stars and planets and moons ? That 's all Big Bang stuff still out there ! And it 's all moving It do n't look like it 's moving but that 's because it 's all moving away from us and getting smaller and it 's like millions of years away . We ca n't see how it 's moving because time moves slower the farther it is from us ! see ? " Axel was also subject to extended , energetic reveries for which his imagination was the only boundary . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like some of those little stars are really big stars , like the Sun , but they " re far away ! And those stars have got planets too ! And the planets have got space guys who fly around in interstellar ships and talk to each other and float around because they do n't have any gravity ! Did I tell you about gravity yet ? " Not that Agnes made any close acquaintance with facts either , but where Axel 's imaginative improvisations were light - light enough at times to float up to the ceiling - Agnes 's were heavy and drew one back down to the floor . About humans Agnes would say , " Idiots ! Cruel , selfish idiots ! Even the ones who seem nice - keep an eye on them ! You never know when they might turn on you ! " Or she would say , " Brain size ! What good is having a big , fat , bulging brain if you do n't know how to use it ? " Agnes might best be described as a realist unburdened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Between the two Bronte hoped , apprehensively , to sort out for Guinevere some picture of the world as it really was . As for Guinevere , it was hard for anyone to say what she thought , for she was still very young . She was attentive and curious , and showed signs of understanding most everything that was said to her . But what she made of it no one could say , because she had so far not uttered a word . A few , not the least of them Bronte , worried that she might not be able to speak at all . Bronte was a worrier , like many new mothers , and though it was pointed out to her by her friend Kara - a rust-colored apatosaur the same size and shape of Bronte ( but with a longer , somewhat impudent snout ) that many saurs spent a long time listening before trying to speak , she could n't help herself . There were other saurs , of course , who having once started to speak , could n't stop . " Tiber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ! " " Geraldine 's . " " TIBOR 'S ! " " Stop it , you two ! " Agnes shouted . Nothing subliminal in Agnes 's deep voice : you heard her clearly , unquestionably , even if you were on the other side of the house . " I do n't want to hear another word out of either of you ! " " Do n't listen , " said Geraldine . With Geraldine distracted , Tibor took the opportunity to repeat , " Tibor 's ! Tibor 's ! Tibor 's ! " - as if by saying it more often he could win the debate . " Hey ! You want trouble ? " Agnes raised her tail and arched her back until her plates clicked like castanets . : " Yes - " Geraldine said it in a way that sounded both like a question and an answer . Axel and Guinevere turned around to watch , as if a new player had been introduced to the game . " We do n't want trouble , " Sluggo called up to Geraldine . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Tibor 's ! Tibor 's ! Tibor 's ! " Geraldine smiled down at them . Agnes fiercely returned the regard . Sluggo pressed himself closer to Agnes . Charlie and Rosie shuddered . Elliot and Veronica turned away . Alphonse whispered , in a sort of chant , " Ask the question . Ask the question . Ask the question . " Preston , with his keyboard resting on his outstretched legs - an awkward-looking but comfortable posture for him - started to write with the four digits of his small forepaws : " Dear Jeanne , Thank you for your interest in my work . I 'm not sure if I can tell you anything very interesting or revealing about what I do . The books have to speak for themselves - " Guinevere looked up at Geraldine and shook her head . Geraldine looked down at Guinevere and nodded approvingly . Guinevere had reason to shake her head often in the few brief months of her existence . She shook her head at the explanations of how the saurs came to be in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , and when they acted in ways that their manufacturers had n't anticipated , they were treated even worse . Of the thousands that had been sold , most were destroyed or abandoned . Only through the intercession of the Atherton Foundation were the few hundred surviving saurs given places to live , refuges where they were fed and cared for - places like the house where they lived now . Guinevere shook her head quite often with those stories . She shook her head at Agnes 's explanations for the behavior of the humans , the ones who made them and humans in general . She shook her head as she watched the other saurs in the house : playing , being read to , taking messages and lessons from the Reggiesystem computer ; watching the video or - like the Five Wise Buddhasaurs , who did n't look wise at all - blowing into small , plastic musical instruments , looking at each other and chuckling in their high , croaking voices ( " Hoho , " " Hee-hee , " " Hah-hah , " in almost fiendish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never spoke a word . Agnes said that it was because Axel never gave her a chance , but Kara said that when Guinevere was ready to speak , she would . A wealth of questions followed Kara 's assertion . Could Guinevere speak ? Would she ? And when ' ? The other saurs not only wanted to know , they needed to know : already , two more eggs were sitting in Rotomotoman 's incubator , one of Kara 's and one of Agnes 's . Could they expect the egg-born saurs to have the same capabilities as the ones that came from lab/factories ? Or maybe more ? Guinevere was the future . But , for the time being , the future had to be kept a secret . At that very moment , Tom Groverton was in his office a few doors down from the workroom , on the phone with Susan Leahy , the head of the Atherton Foundation , about the strange van that had been parked in the woods near the house . security system cameras had picked it up several times in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its forestry service logo on the side , but the Reggiesystem confirmed that no such service existed . " We ca n't hide Guinevere forever , " Susan said to Tom . " Or the others , when they hatch . " Tom looked out his window , as if he might catch a glimpse of the van again . " Or the others . " " So who are these people with the van ? " " No one from the Office of Bioengineering , " Susan said . " That much we 're sure of . The SANI Corporation owns Toyco , and they 've just merged with a company called Biomatia that just received a big defense contract . They 've been petitioning us pretty strongly for " research privileges . ' " " They want their saurs back , " Tom said . " They wo n't succeed , Tom . We need time , but we 'll work something out . You 'll need to be extra watchful , but I know you can handle it . " Tom Groverton , as he usually did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject . " The other day I was going through some music files in a public database . I found some things by a twentieth-century musician and composer named Omette Coleman . I do n't know if it 's just me , but it sounds just like the Five Wise Buddhasaurs ! " Susan laughed . Tom did n't know enough about music to understand why , but he laughed along with her . He said goodbye and went outside - just for a few minutes - to inspect the security system and to see if he could once more catch a glimpse of the suspicious van . Before stepping out he stopped by Doc , who was sitting on a little plastic cube he kept that served as a stool . He was the unofficial referee of the Not So Hard game . " I 'll just be a minute , " Tom said . " Keep an eye on things . " Doc raised a forepaw in what would have been a salute had his forepaws been longer . " Worry not , " Doc said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the workroom , Geraldine and Tibor were still faced off , Geraldine still smiling , Tibor still scowling back . But for the moment - silence . Blessed silence . Except for the sound of the radio and Preston typing energetically . " There is no grand scheme to my writing , " Preston tapped away at the keyboard . " I listen to music . The music suggests stories to me , the way that clouds suggest images and shapes . Shostakovich for some . Mahler for others . And every now and then I dabble in Bruckner . " " After these messages , " Alphonse heard from the radio , " we 'll be giving today 's trivia question ! " Agnes lowered her tail and cautiously unclenched her teeth . Geraldine kept smiling , as if testing the light breeze that came through the window behind Tibor 's castle , or staring through that window at something far off - or , as if waiting for the proper moment to say " Geraldine 's . " " Tibor'sl " " That does it ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Get those plastic stairs over there and put them up by her desk ! " The plastic stairs were an adjustable device used by the saurs to get up on tables , chairs , couches and the like . They were set on casters so that they could be moved easily from one place to another , and a few presses of a lever reset the height and pitch of the stairs . Axel brought over the set of stairs currently placed up against Preston 's desk . " Hey ! " said Charlie . " Now Preston ca n't get down ! " " We 'll bring it back ! " Agnes said . " This is important ! " Axel pushed the stairs over to Geraldine 's desk . Preston kept on , not even noticing . " I listened to many stories , and read many more . Something about their shape , their certainty , comforted me through some very hard times . " He thought about taking out that last part .

" " " Do n't make me come up there ! " Agnes shouted . " You do n't want to go up there , " Sluggo whispered to her , and added emphatically , " Geraldine ! " " Oh , shut up ! " Agnes approached the plastic stairs . " This nonsense has to stop ! " " The universe does n't belong to either of you ! " Sluggo called up to Geraldine and Tibor . " It does n't belong to anyone !

" They 're only doing it for the attention . " Agnes scowled up at the two . " If they were n't doing it in front of Guinevere ! " " Hey ! Guys !

' " " Not one , " Tibor said . " Many . " " Many what ? " Axel , forepaws resting on the plastic stairs , stared up at Tibor . " Universes . Many . This one is Tibor 's ! " " Geraldine 's . " Axel 's jaw opened wide . " Universes ? " Still holding on to the plastic stairs , he stepped toward Tibor 's desk . " Many universes , " Tibor said . " Where you keep'em ? " He took another step . " Come . Up here . Tibor will reveal all . " " Heyyyy ! " Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's universes ? " he asked . " Physics guys say you can make universes as small as a pocket . You know what a pocket is ? " Guinevere , hurrying along after Axel , looked up at Geraldine . Geraldine smiled down at her and nodded . Agnes watched the plastic stairs scooting quickly away from her and shouted , " Hey ! Put that back ! Leave it ! Ne touchez pas ! " " Agnes ! " Sluggo whispered . " Please ! " " Oh , shut up ! " She followed after them with her tail raised . " Axel ! Guinevere ! " But Axel could n't hear her . He was thinking : Universes ! The stairs slapped abruptly against Tiber 's desk . The desks were all about the same height , so Axel did n't need to adjust the steps . " Do n't go up there ! " Agnes shouted . " And do n't let Guinevere - " But Guinevere had already shot past Axel and was halfway up the stairs . " Guinevere ! " Agnes gasped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey ! Guinevere ! Wait ! " Axel raced up after her . Agnes followed , tail raised as she shouted , " Stop her , you idiot ! " Sluggo trailed behind , ducking back several times to avoid Agnes 's tail . Tibor stood in the small ( Tibor-sized ) doorway of his castle when Guinevere and Axel made it to the top of the desk . It was the only entrance - or exit . Guinevere , on her tiny but very swift legs , slipped into the castle past Tibor . " Hey ! Guinevere ! Maybe you should - " Axel stopped at the doorway : Tibor-sized , not Axel-sized . " Heyyy ! How do I get in ? " " Tiber 's sanctum sanctorum . " Tibor backed into his castle until he was completely within its cardboard walls . Axel dropped down to his belly . He squeezed his head and forepaws through and could squeeze no further . Agnes and Sluggo stood behind him . " Get her out of there ! " Agnes shouted . " Get her out of there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Axel 's vision slowly adjusted to the dark interior of the box . At first he could see nothing at all . And then - the darkness filled with stars ! " Heyyyy ! " More stars than the clear nighttime sky . More stars than on the old Screensaver of the Reggiesystem downstairs computer ! There were stars and planets and galaxies and clouds of cosmic gases extending in every direction . The universe expanded outward like a projection in a planetarium show , and Axel could see it all - stars being born , galaxies collapsing in their dotage . In the middle of it all " stood " Tibor and Guinevere , looking more like they were floating in space . " Tibor 's universe , " Tibor said to Guinevere . " Behold ! " " It 's neat ! " Axel shouted . " You got any space guys in here too ? " " Very few life forms exist in this universe , " Tibor said , looking at Guinevere but answering Axel 's question . " Tibor had other universes , teeming with life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? " " Sizes and scales are relative . All universes may fit in here , within scale . All time may fit in here . " Suddenly , the universe started moving backward , or inward , and everything Axel had seen moving away from him was now rapidly approaching , like a huge skyrocket in reverse , pulling back all its fire , fragments and filaments . The hundred billion stars seemed to be heading straight for Axel 's head . " AAAAAAAAA ! " he screamed . But the Big Crunch did n't crush him . It retreated to a spot in the center of the castle , where for an instant it looked like one fiercely brilliant star over Tibor 's head , then extinguished . " So it was . So it is . So it will be . " It sounded like something Axel heard in the space stories he watched on the video , like Guardians of the Galaxy ; or the historical stories where the humans wore robes and sandals , and they walked around in big temples and pyramids . Absent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tibor 's castle : a few luminous blue lozenges , which might have been pulled off the control panels of some technical equipment ; a pocket-sized computer with its color screen repeating an image of an expanding sphere ; a booksized rectangular piece of clear material , like an old Plexiglas remnant ; a few oddly shaped pieces of metal , bolts and washers possibly , arranged in two lines that met at a right angle to form a big letter T. Some paper pictures were pinned to the cardboard walls . Axel recognized the portraits of Napoleon and Beethoven . The other faces he did n't know , but they all looked like Tibor , even one that had the hair and tusks of a warthog . " Eight hundred billion years ago , " Tibor said , " - eight hundred billion years from now , Tibor and Geraldine played . " " Whatcha play ? " Axel found any mention of play interesting . An image filled one of the walls of Tiber 's castle : projected . Not projected on the wall so much as in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sitting before a huge , dark space : like an aviation hangar or the interior of a cathedral . Each of them sat before their own small gray box , on which they each rested their forelegs . And then Axel felt something smack hard against his back , just above his tail . " Owwww ! Hey ! " " What the hell 's going on in there ? " Agnes shouted . " Move it ! " WHEN ACE RETURNED to the workroom , still riding on his skate , he could n't quite see what was happening atop Tibor 's desk . He saw the plastic stairs . He saw Agnes 's tail swinging . He could hear Axel 's shout , " I 'M STUCK ! " But muffled , as if his head was inside a cardboard box . And from Alphonse 's little radio , he heard an announcer : " And here 's today 's trivia question : Which major toy company once used the slogan , " From our labs to your playrooms ' ? " " Toyco ! " Alphonse tapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Toyco ! Toyco ! It 's - it 's so easy " he said to his gathered friends . He had a high voice and he shouted the syllables with such enthusiasm that it sounded more like the honking of one of the Buddhasaurs " plastic horns . But Charlie , Rosie , Veronica , and Elliott did n't hear any of it . They were staring up at Tibor 's castle . Preston heard none of it either . He was staring at what he had just written : " I want to be forthcoming for once . You know I write under a pseudonym . My real name is Preston . Just Preston - no other name . The photograph that accompanies my novels is of the human who takes care of the house where I live . I am - " He hesitated , the digits of his forepaws raised over his keyboard before finishing the sentence " - a saur . " Geraldine was not to be seen , but her lab was once again alive with flickerings and flashings and strange noises . Ace U-turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode downstairs on the flatbed lift ( originally designed to hold a wheelchair ) that took the saurs from one floor to the other . On the first floor he rode straight to the library , where Bronte was reading to Hetman , whose bed had been wheeled over to the window . Kara was with her , as were a number of other saurs who enjoyed listening to her read . Bronte read from a book titled Ulysses . Diogenes , a shy tyrannosaur and the unofficial librarian of the house , had pulled it from one of the upper shelves . At a little over a meter tall , he was one of the few saurs who could reach it . He must have thought it was another account of the events that followed the Trojan War , since Hetman enjoyed the works of Homer and Virgil . But as Bronte read about Buck Milligan , the shaving bowl and the lather , she stopped to say , " Maybe this is a " modern " prologue . They are using a lot of Latin - " When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the little boy , Sargent , doing over his sums , she said , " I 'm sorry , Hetman . I thought this was another story . I 'll have Diogenes find us another book . " " Keep going , " Hetman said in his rough , deep voice . " I like this Stephen Dedalus - what he says about the little boy : " Yet someone had loved him , borne him in her arms and in her heart . But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot/Please read on . " " Axel 's head is stuck in the door of Tibor 's castle ! " said Ace . " What ! " The pages of Ulysses fluttered before Bronte like a fan . Ace said , louder : " Axel 's head is stuck in the door of Tibor 's Castle ! " " Where 's Guinevere ? " " Inside Tibor 's Castle . " The copy of Ulysses slipped from Bronte 's footstool-lectern and thudded to the floor . " But Agnes - " " She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but he still ca n't get his head out . " " As if that 's going to help ! " Kara looked upward . " We better get up there before Agnes flattens him ! " The little ones who 'd gathered around for the reading started to chatter and whisper . The story circulated among them , from those who had heard to those who had n't , inevitably altered along the way on a few slight details : " Agnes is heating Axel ! " " Tibor 's castle ate Guinevere ! " " Somebody stole Axel 's head ! " As quickly as the story spread the saurs made their way up to the workroom to see . " Oh , Hetman , I 'm sorry ! " Bronte said , trying to close the book neatly on the floor as Kara waited . " I do n't remember the page where - " " The story can wait , " Hetman replied . " You must go to your child . " " Thank you , " said Bronte . " I 'm so - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm sure she 'll be fine . " " Geraldine 's lab , " Ace told them , " is making a lot of noise . " He turned his skate around and joined the crowd heading upstairs . " Geraldine ! " Hetman took a deep , wheezy , breath . " Hurry , Bronte ! " Bronte and Kara made their way quickly , but the lift was already too crowded . Every saur who was n't already in the workroom was heading for it , with the exception of Diogenes , who stayed with Hetman , and the odd pair ( one short , one tall ) of green tyrannosaurs - Jean-Claude and Pierrot - who were captivated by a catalog from the Idaho Steak Ranch . The game of Not So Hard was unofficially declared delayed on account of Axel 's head being stuck in something . Even the Five Wise Buddhasaurs put down their synthesized horns and hopped down from the couch . Doc limped along on his tricky leg and called out to the other saurs , " My friends ! My friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please ! " " Doc ! " Kara called out from the clot of saurs heading up the stairs . " We 'll need your help ! " " I 'll be there as soon as I can ! " He lamented for once that the house did n't have a device larger than the skates - for which he was too big . Something along the lines of a scooter , perhaps , would be in order . Hubert , a tyrannosaur of about the same height as Diogenes , noticed Doc 's plight and held up the advance of a large spaniel-sized ( but wider in girth ) brown triceratops named Dr. David Norman . Hubert bent his legs , picked Doc up from just under his forepaws and gently placed him on Dr. Norman 's back . " Now , " Hubert said in a whispery voice , " you can ride . " " My thanks . " Doc held onto Dr. Norman 's bony crest . " This is most - unconventional . I hope I do n't prove too heavy . " Dr. Norman shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He started for the stairs and added , somewhat cryptically , " Or monkeys . " Hubert stayed alongside , a forepaw on Doc 's back in case he slipped , and the three carefully but determinedly made their way through the throng of saurs heading upstairs . UPSTAIRS , AGNES and Sluggo dropped onto their bellies , exhausted . They had shouldered ( with as much shoulder as they had , which was very little ) up against Axel , in an effort to push him out : an exercise which had about as much effect in extricating Axel 's head from Tiber 's castle as pressing their shoulders against a solid stone wall . " Sluggo , " Agnes said between deep gasps . " This is n't working . We 're - we 're - " She could hardly bring herself to say it . " - quadrupeds ! We 're not built for this ! " " I know , " said Sluggo through shorter , faster gasps . " Well , why did n't you say something ? " " I -I did . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey ! " Agnes shouted to Rotomotoman , who had rolled over to the desk and stared at them with his enormous eyes . For two simple plastic disks with simple-looking black pupils , Rotomotoman 's eyes displayed a remarkable range of expression , finding every nuance between astonishment and bafflement . But Agnes , so intent on scrutinizing others , was less adept at being scrutinized . " Get back over there ! You 've got eggs in you ! I 'm not going to have you tipping over and killing my little one ! " From where she stood , Agnes could n't read the words displayed on Rotomotoman 's torso screen : WANT : TO : HELP - but it would n't have made a difference to her . " Go on ! Beat it ! Everything 's under control here ! " To the saurs crowded into the workroom , it must not have sounded very convincing . Agnes stared down at them from the edge of the desk . " Hey ! Nothing to see up here ! Go back to whatever you were doing ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way up the plastic stairs , were not about to go anywhere . " Hmmm . " Agnes , as usual , could not hide her embarrassment . She could only ignore it . " Well , I did n't mean you ! As long as you 're here , you can help me out . " " Agnes , " Bronte started to say , " what - how- ? " " I 'M STILL STUCK ! " Axel shouted . Agnes delivered to him a lateral whack with her tail . " Calm down , idiot ! " Kara quickly stepped between them . " Stop hitting him ! " " I 'm not hurting him . Just giving him a little incentive . " " Quiet ! Quiet ! " Alphonse shouted to the saurs who filled the workroom . " I 'm on the radio ! " He adjusted the volume in time to hear the announcer say , " In a moment we 'll be back to the phones with a voice that 's familiar to most of you . That 's right , Alphonse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully answer today 's trivia question - " " Toyco ! " Alphonse shouted . " Toyco ! Toyco ! Toyco ! " " After this brief message- " INSIDE THE CASTLE , Tibor continued to tell his story to Guinevere - between Axel 's cries of " I 'M STILL STUCK ! " and his wrestlings to extricate himself . " The game was to build universes , " Tibor said , looking down at Guinevere . " Tibor and Geraldine possessed computers with the initial settings to expand infinitely compressed matter infinitely in all dimensions . The process could be repeated an infinite number of times , with infinite results . " " Infinity , " Axel called to Guinevere . " That means a tot ! " Guinevere stared at the projected image of Graldine and Tibor with their gray boxes , presumably the computers , like the little game units some human children still played with in front of their video screens . Two bright sparks appeared before them , which grew into shimmering spheres . From inside each sphere grew another sphere , and from inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geraldine were neatly concentric and symmetrical , like ripples from a stone dropped in a pond , but ripples in three dimensions - maybe four . They looked like part of a brilliantly choreographed light show . The spheres closest to Tibor looked oblong and wobbly , misshapen and unevenly spaced . Guinevere watched carefully , her head turning from one set of spheres to the other . Axel tried to push , then pull , himself out . Whatever movement he 'd made to squeeze so far into the castle apparently could not be simply reversed . He arched his hind legs and tried to get some traction on the desk 's surface , but it did n't work . Perhaps his head had grown , expanding like one of Tibor 's or Geraldine 's universes . " Each sphere is a universe . Each universe a probability , " said Tibor . " Geraldine 's were mathematically perfect . Tibor 's were not . Tibor hoped to find perfection in imperfection . It was not what Geraldine says : that Tibor did n't know how . Perfection is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Axel called to him . " I 'm stuck in your doorway ! How do Iget out ? " Tibor continued , oblivious to Axel 's predicament : " The world will understand someday that they scorned Tibor unfairly . They will lament ! Once , there were worlds with life forms grateful to Tibor ! Life forms that worshiped Tibor ! That built the great Oracle of Tibor ! Tibor Cathedral . Tibor 's Hat , the stately rock formation at the foot of Lake Tibor . The planet of the Tiborians . The Tiborus galaxy . Tibor created all probabilities that loved Tibor ! And Tibor would reward them with his beneficence and genius ! " Guinevere shook her head . Tibor took no notice . He stared up at his own projected images of the gleaming , golden statue of Tibor in the Great Temple of Tibor , one hundred meters tall . " Had they lived , " Tibor said . " Had they lived . " " Hitting him is n't going to get him out ! " Kara said . " He 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You give it a try ! " " Ca n't we , maybe , lift the box up ? " asked Bronte . Agnes shook her head . " Tibor 's managed to glue it down with some sort of junk . " " We 'll have to think of something else , " Bronte said . " We should go find Tom , " said Sluggo . " No ! " Agnes faced the box again . " It 's not his business ! We 've got to figure this out for ourselves ! " She raised herself , placing her forelegs on Axel 's back , then pressed down on the base of his tail as if it were a pump handle . " I 'M STILL STUCK ! " Axel shouted . " Hmmm ! " said Agnes . " That wo n't work either . " By this time , Doc had arrived . Hubert had lifted him from Dr. Norman 's back and placed him more than halfway up the plastic stairs . " My friends , my thanks , " he said , and cautiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catastrophe has befallen - " Doc started to say , but , making a quick inspection , he did n't require an answer . " Good heavens ! " " What are we going to do ? " asked Bronte . " Lubrication is not going to help . " Doc gently patted Axel 's back with his forepaw . " Relax , my friend . We 'll have you out of there soon enough . " " Not soon enough for Guinevere , " Agnes said . " Who knows what sort of idiocy that psycho-saur is telling her ! " Doc put his ear up to the cardboard castle 's side . " Whatever he 's telling her , he 's not being very concise . " " Hey ! " Agnes banged on the castle with her tail . " Guinevere ! Whatever he 's telling you , do n't listen ! " " STOP HITTING THE BOX ! " Axel shouted . Doc walked to the edge of the desk , where Hubert was waiting to see if he could be of any more help . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office ? " Hubert nodded slowly . " Knife ? " Bronte looked back at Axel , still kicking and struggling . " We ca n't use a knife ! " " I know we 're not very well adapted to human tools , but we could take a stab - er , we can give it a try . " " What if we slip ? " " It ca n't be too difficult , it 's merely cardboard . " " What is ? Axel 's head ? " Agnes said . " It is n't that , " Bronte said . " We 'd be wrecking Tiber 's place . I know it 's silly . It 's delusional , but it 's Tibor 's . What else can it be ? It 's his - his - environment . " " What ! Are you nuts ? " said Agnes . " Your baby is inside that thing ! " " I know , " said Bronte , turning from the cardboard walls to Axel . " But we ca n't wreck Tibor 's home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hubert , we wo n't use the box knife . We 'll have to find another way . " IMPACNEWZRADIO followed their " brief " message with another " brief " message , followed by another " brief " message . Ice cream stores , bedding sales , real estate and youth-restoring over-the-counter inhalants : Alphonse heard about all of it . " We need to break for weather and headlines , but as soon as we 're back we 've got Alphonse on the line to answer today 's trivia question . Thanks for holding on , Alphonse . " " Toyco ! " Alphonse wrapped his duo-digited forepaws into little fists in anticipation . " The boy I 'd been bought for went to school during the day , " Preston wrote . " I was alone . I started to read the books on the shelf : the " Great Books " and the encyclopedia . No one else ever touched them . They were considered as decoration , though they were rarely even dusted . But they helped a great deal when I had to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castle , the projected images of Tiborian glory were replaced with the images of Tiborian decline : his universes floundering , faltering , collapsing in on themselves like sandcastles in the Sun . " Had they lived , " Tibor said to Guinevere . " In the few remaining Tiborian universes , worship turned to hatred . Tibor visited these worlds , to help - out of the kindness and goodness and mercy in Tibor 's heart - " Guinevere made a little noise , like a sneeze . " It was not what Geraldine says , that Tibor did not know what he was doing . Tibor suspects conspiracy . Tibor suspects sabotage . " Guinevere sneezed again , only this time the noise sounded more like a chuckle . The noise came out two , three more times . Guinevere could n't suppress it . " Across a hundred universes , Tibor was hunted by his enemies , " said Tibor . " He lost the means to return to his own universe . It was not what Geraldine says : that he does n't know how . Tibor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As did Geraldine , who followed Tibor , out of guilt and worry for his well-being . " And now Tibor works to find a way back to his own time and universe . His true home . Tibor will return . " Guinevere 's sneezes increased in number , and as they increased they were joined by the first noises to issue from that tiny , virginal larynx at the top of the apatosaur 's slender neck . It was laughter . And she kept laughing for some time after Tibor had finished his long , sad tale . Outside , Doc gestured to Rotomotoman , who was still watching , his display screen still proclaiming WANT : TO : HELP . " Rotomotoman ! " Doc said . " We need your assistance , if you please . " " No you do n't ! " Agnes said . " That thing 's got our eggs in it ! " " My dear Agnes , " Doc said , " with all due respect , we need someone or something that can turn and pull Axel with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit on the desk , but too short to reach Axel from the floor , as would be Diogenes . Our friends , Jean-Claude and Pierrot , might be able to do the job , but the last time I saw them they were transfixed by a copy of some catalog of meat . " " Buffoons ! " Agnes said . " Idiots ! " " What we need , frankly , is a pair of hands , which Rotomotoman has . Our friend , Tom , also has a pair of hands . If you would prefer to call for him - " " Oh shut up ! " Agnes said . " You win . But if anything happens to those eggs - " " Completely understood , " Doc replied . " Hubert , if you could stand just behind our cylindrical assistant in the unlikely event that he loses balance - " Hubert placed himself behind Rotomotoman , legs and forepaws spread in a kind of near-embrace . " Now , Rotomotoman , " Doc continued , " if you could adjust your height enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow 's ankles . And Axel - " " Yes , Doc ? " Axel said , from the other side of the cardboard wall . " Please cease kicking , if you would . " " Okay ! " Rotomotoman extended the metal tubes on which his wheels were affixed ( and were usually retracted into his torso ) , raising his height just the few centimeters necessary to reach out straight with his metal hands and take hold of Axel 's ankles . " Now , " Doc said , " raise him just a bit and turn him this way , on his back . " Doc made a counterclockwise gesture with his forepaw . " Kara , Bronte : if you can get your forelegs a little under him as Rotomotoman does that , you can keep Axel from chafing . " " Hey ! " Axel called out as the makeshift crew went to work . " What are you doing ? " " Unscrewing your head ! " Agnes said . " Like a lightbulb . " " AAAAAA ! " " Not exactly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I know a way to get you out . You must , however , do one thing for me , at least for a few minutes , if you can . " " Sure , Doc . What do I have to do ? " " Close your mouth . " " I can do that ! Watch ! " Not that anyone but Tibor and Guinevere could watch , nor did they , but he really did close his mouth . " Mouth closed ? " : " Mmmm-mmmm ! " " Good work ! " Doc patted him again . " Now , lift ! " Doc said to Rotomotoman . " Up ! Straight up , but with a bit of an arc ! Pull - just a trace ! Yes ! I think we 've almost got him free ! " Rotomotoman extended his legs a little higher and lifted Axel until he was completely upside-down , but nearly extricated . The snout part of his head was still inside the castle . Doc reached down and placed a forepaw on either side of Axel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good Axel . Now all we need to do is pull your head just - a bit - more . " All those years , " he said softly , " helping children with their wooden block toys and puzzles have finally paid off . " With Axel just a few millimeters away from freedom , Doc hardly took notice of how much louder he had to speak even to hear himself in these quiet remarks . But it was more apparent when Agnes nudged him over and shouted into the box , " Guinevere ! Come out of there ! " - and that was hard for him to hear - that something was intruding on the already chaotic ambience of the room . A noise of some sort - a humming , though it could also be understood as a rapid , steady oscillation . This humming noise was accompanied by the brightening light from the ceiling fixture , which escaped notice until it occurred to some of the saurs in the workroom that the ceiling fixture had not been turned on , it being the midafternoon of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the light , and the hum - and most particularly of the vibrations through the floor that seemed to be coming from both . Doc looked up when he heard the crackle of delicate glass in the light fixture . Off it went . The shards of bulb , fortunately , were contained within the fixture itself . Bronte tried to say something to Doc , which he could n't make out . He wondered if he might be going deaf but then , as if to dispel this fear , he turned to a greater one - across the workroom . Geraldine 's lab was alive with intense light . It could have been a theater 's or movie studio 's arc lamp , or a lighthouse beacon - Doc would n't have been surprised . The light did have a sort of direction - a concreteness to it , like a shaft - directed across the room and through the window . The fire extinguishers , in that instant , seemed ridiculously inadequate . Some of the little ones , understandably frightened , headed for the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plastic cube not unlike Doc 's , burst into applause at the light , the hum , and the panic . " Hee-hee ! " said the Buddhasaur triceratops . The Buddhasaur stegosaurus said " Hah-hah ! " The Buddhasaur allosaurus , hadrosaur , and tyrannosaur answered , " Ho-ho ! " and cackled . " I lived with those homeless people for several months , " Preston wrote to the graduate student , " sleeping in the underpass . I justified my " keep " by making signs they used when panhandling . " He had to squint now to read over his words . Not only was the light from Geraldine 's lab creating a glare , but the image itself was fading , as if the power was being drained from his screen . " Eventually , the police rounded them up and I was taken along . That 's when I was turned over to the Atherton people . " He now felt clearly that revealing the truth about himself was not a good idea . The news would be met with disbelief . If not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven more by novelty than the relative merits of what he had written . Still , he wanted the chance to read over this little biography and get a feel for what it might be like to tell the world ( or at least a curious graduate student ) who he really was . For , in a sense , he would n't really know the answer until he had written it . " Now we 're back , " the radio announcer said . But the digital signal seemed to be encountering interference . Pieces of it , like tiles on an old mosaic , were dropping out . " - think Alphonse is stion the line . Alphonse , thanks waiting . " " Toyco ! Toyco ! Toyco ! " Alphonse pressed the phone tightly to his ear . " Now ; repeatday 's trivques , what major toy com once the slogan , " our labs to playrooms ' ? " " Toyco ! " Alphonse shouted again . " It 's Toyco ! Toyco ! " AGNES AND BRONTE peeked into the space between Axel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glimpse of Guinevere . Doc pulled Axel 's head out a little farther : almost there . So far , Axel had done just what Doc requested , kept his mouth closed and restrained himself from saying anything or making any noise . But when the same overpowering light that emanated from Geraldine 's lab came out of Tibor 's castle as well - in one bright , humming flash - Axel was left with one , predictable , recourse : " AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! " Doc had to turn away , at once temporarily blinded and deafened . He tried to signal to Rotomotoman to bring Axel down slowly , but Rotomotoman was motionless , as if his batteries had drained . The display screen on his torso filled with an apparently random hodgepodge of Greek and Arabic alphabet characters . Axel , left dangling in the firm grip of Rotomotoman , continued , somewhat more emphatically : " AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! " With the light now coming out of both cardboard edifices , the Five Wise Buddhasaurs applauded even more effusively , much as if a fireworks display had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phonse , we could n't quite he that answer . Could you turn your rad down , please ? " " TOYCO ! TOYCO ! TOYYYYCOOO ! " " Alphonse ? Alphonse ? " " TOOOOYCO ! " " Sorry , think we 've lost Alphonse . We getting of ference. go to move on to the next - " " TOY- ! " Alphonse 's mouth was still open , but the last syllable never made it out . The light grew even brighter . For a moment , the light was all anyone could see And then it was gone , and with it the infernal hum and the crackling rush of air . The workroom fell silent - or almost so . " AAAAAAAAAAAAA ! " Preston looked at his display screen - empty ! Except for the little word " Sent , " on the function display line above his toolbar . He felt numb and practically had to will himself to breathe . He thought : What have I done ? and slowly closed his eyes . " Guinevere ? Guinevere ? " Bronte looked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out now ! " " Guinevere ! " Agnes pushed past Bronte and poked her head through the doorway . " Hey ! Time to go ! Smells terrible in here ! " Rotomotoman jolted back to life . He gently lowered Axel to the top of the desk while his display screen clicked through a number of punctuation marks and a spasm of diagonal interference . At last he locked upon the message , AXEL : SAFE . Axel , out of the box , rocked from one side to the other , trying to stand up . " Relax , " Doc said , helping him up . " Slowly . You 've been through quite an ordeal . " " Hey , Doc ! Guys ! You wo n't believe ! I saw my own body like it was on the other side of the room ! " " Calm down , " Doc said gently . " Are you all right ? Can you see ? " " Yeah ! I see - spots ! And they 're shaped like Guinevere and Tibor ! " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fortunately , not like that . " Doc looked across the room , at Geraldine 's lab , and his jaw dropped open . " Oh - my - dear ! " " Guinevere ? " Bronte looked once more into Tiber 's castle . " Please come out . We 're worried about you . " Her eyes were still clouded from the blast of light . All she could make out , faintly , in Tiber 's castle was Tibor , or just his forelegs , in the shadows . Guinevere was not to be seen . Doc tapped her gently on the back . His voice faltered and sounded higher-pitched than usual . " She - she 's over there ' . " Bronte withdrew her head from the cardboard box . Doc was pointing across the room , to Geraldine 's lab - and to Guinevere , who had just emerged from it . Bronte blinked , as if it might just be an effect of the light , then looked again . " Agnes , " Bronte said , as she watched Guinevere walk to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You said - " " She was ! " Agnes 's mouth dropped open . " I saw her go in myself ! " " She was in therel " Axel pointed to Tibor 's castle . " Now she 's over there ! " He pointed back to Guinevere . " That 's like - super science ! " " I do n't see this . " Agnes said . " I refuse - " " Maybe it 's a trick , " Sluggo said , " like the magic shows on the video . " " If so , then how ? " Doc asked . " The stage magicians have trapdoors . Where is the trap door here ? " " It 's in space ! " Axel said , stretching to rub his neck with his f orepaw . " Like , the wormy-holes where everything gets sucked in and comes out on Saturn ! " " Axel , my friend , " Doc said . " I try not to discount any fairly reasonable hypothesis , but I do wish that reality would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kara called into the cardboard castle . " Tibor ! I know you 're in there . " " Tibor is not ! " The shaken voice came from inside . " Tibor ! What happened ? " He did n't answer . When Kara peered in she could make out no more than a shadow , shuddering in a corner . Bronte shouted , " Guinevere ! Stay there ! I 'm coming ! " and started down the plastic stairs . The others followed , and as soon as they were all on the floor , Hubert rolled the plastic stairs over to Geraldine 's desk . Alphonse stared at the little group walking from Tibor 's desk to Geraldine 's , but really did n't see them . The phone had dropped from his open forepaw . Rosie nudged him consolingly . " We know , anyway . " " You did good , " Charlie said as he switched off the radio . " Does n't matter what they know . " " It does , " Alphonse said , then corrected himself : " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Veronica carefully closed up the phone with her snout . " Wo n't be a record , but - tomorrow . " PRESTON , LOOKING at his empty screen , resigned himself to his fate . The world would discover the identity of Ellis Lawrence Cartwright . Or maybe Jeanne , the graduate student , would n't believe him . Or if she did , maybe no one would believe her . But if they did , what would happen then ? He checked his " sent " folder - the message was n't there ! It was possible that the message had been intercepted by something , or just disintegrated in whatever strange power surge emanated from Geraldine 's lab . Which meant the message might not have been sent after all . He put the keyboard down to his side as if coming out of a trance , stood up , and for the first time that afternoon he looked around the workroom . Half the saurs in the house seemed to be there , all staring up at Geraldine 's desk as if something astounding - or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see was Guinevere , standing at the edge of the desk as her mother , Kara , Agnes , Sluggo , Axel and Doc made their way to her . Geraldine 's lab was dark and still . Tom found the suspicious " forestry service " van about where he expected to find it , parked in a small clearing roughly twenty meters out past the property line and security perimeter . Nothing much about it suggested that it had anything to do with forestry . The only thing on or around it that even vaguely qualified as equipment was a rather long antenna fixed dead center atop the cab . He could n't detect any activity around the van , and no one was visible inside or nearby it - like it had simply been parked there . He was about to move on and see if he could find some sign of the van 's occupants elsewhere when he heard an odd noise : like a gust of wind and a sizzling of atmosphere , followed by a bright flash , like lightning . On a clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . He did n't hear anything like thunder but remained flat in the moss and cool dirt until he heard a muffled yelp and a startled expletive that sounded like it came from the back of the van . Tom looked up at the van . A white-bluish smoke escaped through the back doors . The engine started up quickly , gunned , and the van jolted into motion with a gear-stripping groan . As it pulled away , the van just missed a tree . The antenna bent severely as it caught in the lower branches . Tom watched them - heard them , really - connect abruptly with the service road on the other side of the dense line of trees , and head off with a roar . In the hazy smoke the van left behind , he smelled something distinct from the smells of even an old , inefficient , gas-burning vehicle ( and the van did n't look that old ) : something more like burning plastic , and that " ozone " smell one associates with electrical fires . He pressed a finger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ van had malfunctioned . But he remembered that he first heard that strange sizzling noise behind him . Tom turned around , where he could clearly see the house . It might have been an intuitive leap , or his imagination getting the better of him , but he saw ( or thought he did ) a flicker of light - from that distance no more than a little glass bead catching the sunlight - in the workroom window . Tom ran all the way back to the house . " Guinevere ? " Bronte gently nuzzled her child 's head . " It 's time to go . I 'm reading a book to Hetman downstairs . It 's called Ulysses . Would you like to listen with us ? " Guinevere pressed herself against her mother 's side and nodded . " I think we should be together more . It 's very nice of Agnes and Axel to keep an eye on you , but maybe they should have some more time for themselves . Do n't you think ? " Guinevere shook her head . Geraldine peeked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the workroom , breathless , holding his chest . " What - " Tom said and stopped to take a few extra breaths . He looked at the saurs in front of Geraldine 's lab , then at Geraldine , in her doorway - then he took a second look at her . She was wearing goggles . Tiny , Geraldine-sized goggles . They might have been appropriated from some child 's doll or action figure , but how did the little quadruped ever get them on ? " What did I just , conveniently , miss ? " Tom asked Doc . Doc raised his forepaws and let them drop back down slowly . " Is there a chance that one might find a few drops , just a thimbleful , maybe , of vodka in the house ? " Axel whispered to Guinevere , as he pointed to the pair of jeans Tom was wearing . " see that flap where Tom 's got his hand ? That 's a pocket ! " Geraldine stepped out of her lab . She smiled at Bronte , who protectively stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled at Guinevere too , but for once her smile appeared to suggest that she was sharing her private joke . She nodded to Guinevere . And Guinevere nodded back . Bronte shuddered . And when she noticed that Guinevere was smiling very much the way Geraldine smiled , she hurried her child back down the plastic stairs . " Monster ! " Agnes barked at Geraldine . " Demon ! You are insane and dangerous ! " " So what ? " said Geraldine . Doc and Sluggo managed to restrain Agnes before any further escalation occurred . Geraldine walked to the edge of the desk and surveyed the workroom as if she were making an assessment of it and all the rest of the great world beyond it , fixing her gaze last upon the cardboard box that Tibor called his castle . " Tibor 's universe , " was her conclusion . Nothing stirred in the cardboard box for a good two minutes , until Tibor , very cautiously , poked his head out from his castle . Geraldine repeated : " Tibor 's . " Tibor took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swelling himself with a great breath , returned to his serene , imperial posture . " Tibor 's ! " he said and , with order restored to his universe , he retired to his castle . Tom stood in a spot just between Geraldine 's lab and Tibor 's castle . He looked up at the light fixture with its broken bulb , then bent down a little , as if trying to get a desk-eye view of what could be seen through the workroom window . He pressed his finger thoughtfully up to his mustache and started to ask , " Geraldine - " then shook his head and turned to Preston . " I do n't suppose you would know - " " Sorry . " Preston shook his head . " I was a little involved in my work . It all happened rather suddenly . " Tom , with his eyes closed , nodded . " That it did . Whatever it was . " He held up a finger and said , " I need to make a call . I 'll be back later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jean-Claude and Pierrot came running in , Pierrot holding open a page of the Idaho Steak Ranch catalog . " Tom ! Tom ! " said Pierrot . " Why ca n't we get meat that looks like this ? " Tom looked at the open page . " Because , guys , that is a side of beef . We do n't buy sides of beef . " He headed out of the room . " Well , why not ? " asked Pierrot . " Hey , " Jean-Claude asked , looking around the room . " Something happen here ? " " Who knows ? " Tom ushered them into the hallway . In the middle of the room , Alphonse was still sitting among his companions , but they were joined by the Five Wise Buddhasaurs , who had gone off and returned with their instruments . They were playing , for Alphonse , something that might have sounded like " Chicago Breakdown " colliding with " Beau Koo Jack " simultaneously , or just the random squealings and squawks of five plastic horns interspersed with " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But they were playing for Alphonse , and Alphonse was smiling . " Hey , Preston ! " Axel pushed the plastic stairs over to Preston 's desk . " I brought this back for you ! " " Thank you , Axel . " " Agnes said I should have my head examined ! " " Agnes says that to everyone , " Preston said . " Does your head hurt ? " He turned his head experimentally , first left , then right . " No ! It feels fine ! My neck is a little stiff ! " " That should go away soon . If it does n't , make sure to tell Dr. Margaret . " " Oh , I will ! " Axel stood in front of the plastic stairs , just looking at them . " Preston ? " " Yes , Axel . " " They want me to stay away from Guinevere ! Agnes said I 'm danger- . ous ! " " That 's not for Agnes to decide . I 'm sure it 's only for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also knows you 're not dangerous . " And Preston added , to himself , at least not intentionally . " I still got a lot of things to teach Guinevere ! " He looked down at his feet , as if unable to look anywhere else . " I did n't mean to get my head stuck in Tibor 's castle ! And Guinevere is - she 's - fasti " " Axel , " Preston said , " If you 'll give me a minute or two to finish something I 'm writing , I 'd like to hear about everything that happened to you and Guinevere , if you 'd like to tell me about it . " " YES ! " Axel hurried up the stairs , smiling . " Yes ! Preston ! My bestbest friend in the whole world ! Yes ! " " Just a few more minutes . " He sat back down and returned his keyboard to his outstretched legs . He reprised all the information about his work habits that he had already given to the graduate student , but left out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive the earlier message , he could say it was a story he was working on that was inadvertently included . He looked back to find not only Axel but Rotomotoman as well , staring at him . But their wonder and curiosity seemed much less worrying than the scrutiny of a graduate student . " I saw the whole universe ! " Axel said . " It was small , but it was n't anything like apocketl " " Just a moment , " Preston said . " I 'm almost finished . " " About my " philosophy , ' " Preston wrote . " It 's no different from any other creature 's with a sense of good and evil , right and wrong , and some sense of a world beyond one 's internal meanderings . If anything distinguishes my personal philosophy from anyone else 's , it may be my feeling that we are in the employ of some " unknown power/ as Matthew Arnold would have put it . But I 'm divided as to whether that power belongs to a being of great aspirations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Tibor 's castle , then at Geraldine 's lab to his left . " - or one of great but mischievous energies , the goals of which , or of whom , we can only hope are benign . " In the background Preston heard , from a tiny Buddhasaur horn , something that sounded very much like the solo from " Basin Street Blues . " " Patience , " he wrote . " That 's it in a word . My thanks again for your interest . " " He read the lines over with the same sort of trepidation he felt when he finished his first novel - when he finished anything , for that matter - and hit the " send " key . " There , " he said to Axel . " That 's done . Now tell me all about what happened . "
