You remember Dazzle the dog , light ! He debated in 1988 in the British anthology Other Edens II , but more recently ( in " 99 and " 02 , to be precise ) we published two of his capers , one involving his paternity and another concerning his adventures in animal experimentation . ( Another tale , concerning his political exploits , is due to appear in the magazine Fence . ) Now we find the clever canine enjoying life in the ivy-covered halls of academe-but academia has its troubles , too . Aficionados of Mr. Bradfield 's animal tales should seek out Hot Animal Love , his most recent story collection , which contains a baker 's dozen of his reports from the human/animal divide . <p> Weh ! Weh mir Unglcksel'gem ! - Wagner 's Tannhuser FOR A LATE-MIDDLE-AGED mutt with barely three weeks of obedience school under his collar , Dazzle was as surprised as anybody to be awarded a Seymour Fischer Guest Professorship from the Free University in Berlin . " As awkward as it is to admit , Herr Dazzle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Krantzbaum on the day he called to arrange the opening address . " But you would be surprised by how difficult it is to find a decent lecturer in Post-Humanist Studies , especially these days . When Oscar the Baboon canceled at the last minute , we found ourselves grasping at straws . We contacted internationally renowned cats , songbirds , dancing bears , penguins , gender-neutral pachyderms , and even a high-profile crow we once heard about , but they were all booked into the next decade . Then , just as we were about to give up hope , someone told us about you - and your history of iron-jawed protest against the forces of sapienhegemony and control . And the movie deal , mein Gott , that really perked our ears . Be straight with us , Herr Dazzle . Is it true about Scan Perm playing the lead in your life story ? If he 's not too busy , perhaps you might even arrange a guest appearance for your class . " While Dazzle had been giving the matter serious consideration for the last two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a decision until he heard Dr. Kiantzbaum 's strong , sensible voice reaching out for him through the speaker phone . " I 'm genuinely tempted , " Dazzle said , sitting at his lawyer 's desk in a large leather-bound swivel chair . " I really am . I 've always wanted to visit foreign countries and learn about different cultures , and goodness knows I 'm not getting any younger . But frankly , the idea of presenting a public lecture makes me queasy , and while I 've always possessed the gift of gab , I might start feeling pretty intimidated if , you know . People actually started listening . What I 'm trying to say is that I 'd hate to be a big disappointment to you guys . Especially since you 'd be putting me up in that nice apartment off the Rudesheimer Platz , and paying me such a hefty per diem and all . " The transatlantic connection was as crisp and clear as a cold glass of water . " Ach , do n't worry about it , old boy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly doggy like yourself ? We are big dog lovers here in Berlin , Herr Dazzle . We love big shaggy doggies very much . " Dazzle was sitting alone in his lawyer 's office , gazing up at shelves of tightly bound legal volumes which likewise seemed to be gazing down at him . You make a few bucks , Dazzle reflected , sell a few pieces of yourself , and pretty soon it gets harder and harder to escape back into the woods for any decent length of time . There 's always another contract to sign , or another call to take . " Herr Dazzle ? Are you still there ? " But then some pieces of yourself are easier to sell than others . " Yes , Doctor Krantzbaum , and one more thing . As embarrassing as it is to admit , you should know that I do n't speak a word of German . This might prove something of a problem , considering I 'm supposed to be giving lectures and all . " The speaker phone breathed a long , happy sigh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this minor difficulty . Our students are very knowledgeable and hard-working , and their canine is quite excellent , as you will soon find out . Many of them , in fact , speak it even better than myself ! " Dazzle 's reception was held in the lecture hall of the Department of Comparative Cultures , a low-ceilinged , aluminum-sided , mobile-home-like structure set among many fragrant bushes and trees . " You should know right off that I 'm not a trained scholar . Heck , when I was a pup ? I barely learned how to roll over and play dead , which led to some pretty uncomfortable confrontations with my first ( and only ) human family , the Davenports . No , I 'm what you 'd call an autodidactic sort of dog , which is probably what makes me so skeptical about authority figures and so forth . Political leaders , say . Or movies , newspapers , the world-wide-web and , well , I hope this does n't sound rude , but even highbrow academic-types such as yourselves . I simply do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sniff for my goddamn self . It 's not that I think I 'm better than anybody else . It 's just that I never met anybody who 's any better than me - if you can dig the distinction . " They were probably the best-looking group of human beings Dazzle had ever seen in his life : well dressed , well fed , and attentive . But it did n't seem right somehow . All these attractive young people sitting politely in hard foldable chairs and wasting their formidable concentration on him . " I guess what I 'm saying is that I believe in honest advertising , and to be totally honest ? I probably do n't have anything interesting to teach you guys except , of course , what it 's like to be a dog in a human world . So I hope I wo n't be too boring , or distract you too much from the very useful work you 're probably doing in your other classes . And , well , at this point I should probably ask if there are any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any questions , I can let you all go home . " Dazzle was already starting to climb down from his awkward perch on the rim of a rickety pine table when he saw a hand go up . The young woman attached to that hand was so beautiful and well-formed that she could put a dog off other dogs . " I am Agatha Meineke , Herr Professor Dazzle , and I was wondering- " " Please . lust Dazzle . " She blushed . " If you do n't mind my asking , what happens to dogs in America when they refuse to roll over and play dead ? " Her yips and arfs , despite a weird inflection , were almost perfect . " Nobody feeds them , " Dazzle explained simply . " Nobody loves them . They get sent to extermination camps . And if they manage to dig their way out under the fence , they spend the rest of their lives on the lam , running from one garbage can to another . If they 're lucky , like me , they might make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of them are n't lucky . They get picked up by the Man . They get run over by cars . " Three more hands went up . Four . Five . " Are you sure you are providing an accurate representation of canine life in America ? " enquired a young man with a spiny Norwegian burr . " Many of us receive a different impression entirely from your highly entertaining television programs , in which dogs are profound and witty creatures adored by everyone . Billionaires leave them mansions in their will . They live like kings and queens in the lap of luxury . " It was almost sweet , Dazzle thought . Some Norwegian kid believing what he saw on American TV . " Television , " Dazzle replied simply , " only imagines what ca n't be believed . Otherwise , why would there be so many freaking commercials ? " " Are you claiming that in the Land of Liberty , freedom does not exist for everyone ? " " Only if you can afford it . " A buzz of reflected glances and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another hand went up . And signaled that the buzz was over . " Yes . You in back . " The audience emitted a long , collective sigh . A few even rolled their eyes . " Heinrich Mandelbrot , " the young man said . He wore black from head to foot : black turtleneck , black jeans , black loafers . " Abstract philosophy . " " How 's it hanging , Heinrich . " Heinrich leveled his pupil-filled gaze at Dazzle , as if aiming a rifle . " When you label yourself an empiricist , are you referring to empiricism of the logical or moral variety ? And would n't you say that contemporary research into the combinatory nature of public perception has proven conclusively - " " Oh jeez , Heinrich . I do n't think I can answer this . " " Please let me finish . How can you believe what you learn for yourself when you lack the intellectual , moral , or political grounds for knowing who you are to begin with ? I 'm speaking in a meta-linguistic framework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said with a slow , wise nod of his head . He felt a little woozy and out of breath . " The meta-linguistic thingy . Like how do I know I exist outside my head , or something like that ? " The entire audience subsided slowly , as if all the air were being let out of their tires . " No , Herr Dazzle , I am merely seeking a critical self-appraisal in terms of post-Descartian discourse . I 'm sure you 're familiar with Habermas . I 'm sure you 're familiar with the Frankfurt School of Social Research . " Now Dazzle was n't entirely unfamiliar with post-war German philosophy . As a pup , he had browsed vigorously through many books that fell in his path , and had even snuck off to a college lecture or two . But it all seemed so terribly far away , he thought now . And the idea of those well-meaning German exiles wandering the sun-struck streets of Santa Monica just made him feel lonely . Sometimes , he thought , it 's not who t you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say anything at the exact same moment when someone 's waiting to hear it . " Excuse me , Heinrich . I 'm not what you 'd call a systematic thinker , but perhaps I can answer your question . But only with another question . " It was like snapping on all the lights in a dark room - causing the audience of really attractive people to look up with an expression that Dazzle did n't often find in the faces of human beings . Hope ? " And that question is this : Do n't you think it 's time you and your pals led me to some of this Weissbier and sauerkraut I 've heard so much about ? We 've got all term to discuss epistemology , but after traveling fifteen hours baggage class in the bowels of a jumbo jet-hey . This little doggy is starved . " From that day forward , Dazzle liked to say that he had Berliners eating out of his hand . But then , nobody enjoyed an inverted metaphor more than Dazzle . " When I saw my first canine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class during one of his typically aimless , unprepared lectures , " I could n't believe my eyes . Unlike those dead spaces you find in the States , it was n't carpeted over with broken bottles , hypodermics and whatnot , or located in the worst part of town . It actually had flower beds , and a little doggy water fountain , it was classic . I 'm not saying you guys got it perfect here in Berlin ; that 's not what I 'm saying at all . But compared to the States , you still have this fairly workable notion of public life . Public parks , public playgrounds , public transport , even socialized medicine - and it works . Whoever woulda thunk it ? " Dazzle realized that his lectures probably did n't qualify as very educational . He was simply gabbing aimlessly about whatever struck his fancy . Yet students were always thanking him for his time and patience ; the prettier girls openly scratched him behind the ears and cooed sweet endearments ( " What a nice big doggy ! " ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meals at the University cafeteria were surprisingly tasty-though nobody in this far-flung and not-quite-fallen empire seemed to realize that there was such a thing as green vegetables . It was only Heinrich , really , who reminded Dazzle that he was n't measuring up to his role as intellectual mentor . At times , he even made him feel quite guilty about it . " Herr Professor Dazzle ! One moment of your time ! " " Please , just Dazzle . Or poochie-dog . Everybody in the States thinks they can call me poochie-dog-you might as well call me poochie-dog too . " " I 'm so sorry , Herr Professor , but I was thinking about our discussion yesterday and I still do n't understand . Let us imagine , as we were saying , that your doggy consciousness is a goldfish in a goldfish bowl . Is that acceptable ? " " Sure , Heinrich ; whatever . But I have this problem with abstract speculation , see . Ideas about ideas about , you know , ideas . " " Now inside this goldfish bowl , everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bubbling air filter , even your benignly puckered reflection in the mineral-streaked glass . " " I think I follow , Heinrich . Nothing but goldfish bowl . So far as the eye can see . " " But beyond this glass , everything is different . Space , weight , distance . It 's inhabited by huge , distorted creatures . Sometimes they notice you ; but most of the time , they do n't . " " We 're not talking ontology , are we , Heinrich ? Not about knowing the world , or its reality . But simple communication , right ? You speaking to me ; and me speaking to you . " " There is a quite fascinating story about Goethe and Schiller , who were discussing , if I remember correctly , the difference between experience and ideas - " " Goethe and Schiller , " Dazzle said slowly . He could finally see the thronging crowds of the Metro station just ahead . Middle-aged men and women in muted primary colors ; college kids in backpacks and denim . He felt himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoying our little discussion , Heinrich , I 'm afraid this is where I get off . " " Formbewusstein , " Heinrich enunciated harshly . " Surely not an unfamiliar concept for you , Herr Professor . You being such an internationally renowned intellectual and all . " " Form-buh-whatsit , " Dazzle muttered thickly . These Germans sure like ideas , he thought . " Meet me in my office just before class , and I promise . This time I wo n't be late like , you know . The last couple times . " It was just about the only lie Dazzle had told anybody in years . And the funny part was ? It did n't bother him at all . " The sad fact of the matter , " Doctor Krantzbaum explained over a friendly , intercollegiate lunch at Cafe Einstein , " is that nobody wants to swim in the goldfish bowl with poor Heinrich . He is simply too much Sturm und Drang , even for us Germans . He is too much dasein-en-sich and fur-en-sich , too much unterheimlich , too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much Wagner . Perhaps you have not noticed , Mein Doggy , but our new Germany is a far more lighthearted and unassuming place than it once was . We have taken the lead in the common market , and opened our collective hearts to Super Mario and American Pie . We have even adopted many hip expressions from you laid-back California-types , such as " go with the flow , " " tell me about it , " and " let 's get it on . " If I were to boil this cultural sea-change down to a simple analogy : today 's Germany is far less Goethe and far more Friends . You know , as in that weekly assembly of footloose , wacky , and perpetually inter-pollinating youths who enliven our otherwise drab television programs many nights of the week . " Dr. Krantzbaum leaned back and gazed at the bright , chandeliered ceiling , his voice suddenly hushed and reverent . " Now that 's what I call a proper Isolde , Mein Doggy . The sloe-eyed , sharp-tongued one who stole Brad Pitt 's heart a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all my trans-celestial yearnings . " Dazzle liked the Caf Einstein , where they kept the long-stemmed glasses filled with fruity red wine . He liked the shiny white linen tablecloths , the gilded mirrors , the pervasive whiff of coarse-ground sausage , and the multiply reflected images of very old men accompanied by youngish , dyed-blonde second wives wearing too much jewelry . " I 'm not saying that I dislike Heinrich , " Dazzle explained distantly , scanning the wide hand-written menu with barely concealed bemusement . ( Pork venison beef beef lamb pork pork chicken and fish . ) " But he does make me feel like a charlatan . Here he is , coming to class every day with so many intense , well-prepared questions about the truth of perception , and the meaning of reality , and here I am , supposed to be his teacher , and I do n't have a thing to tell him . I look at Heinrich , I look at the clock on the wall , and I simply do n't know how to shut him up . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Something about nature 's excess of sensation . According to Heinrich , nature pulses with so much raw experiential stuff that our meager animal senses ca n't possibly take it all on board . Heinrich calls it a " reality-deficit disorder , " and according to Heinrich , this is why our lives continually reverberate with insufficiency and loss . " Dr. Krantzbaum was already brooding into the final sips of his Black Forest Burgundy . For one long moment , Dazzle thought the good doctor might be getting as tired of Dazzle as Dazzle was getting of Heinrich . Finally , Doctor Krantzbaum replied softly : " Insufficiency , yes , in the face of all our Isoldes . And now , if you do not mind , I will place my order for the pork roast and mashed potatoes with gravy , and thus distract myself from that smug grin I see before me always on that barbarian , you know . That movie star who goes by the name of Brad Pitt . " ACCORDING TO Herr Doctor Krantzbaum , Heinrich 's peasant-stock Mom , a vender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **26;2826;TOOLONG ) by Heinrich 's errant Bavarian father enroute to an international hang-gliding competition on the Greek Isles , where he promptly soared from the rocky cliffs like Icarus and fell just as hard . As a result , Heinrich grew up envisioning Germany as more than a metaphoric and always-absent Fatherland ; it was the fulfillment of identity toward which his overhuge heart always yearned . He grew up reading German poetry , listening to German opera on his Walkman , reading German culture pages , and replaying Fassbinder on his video until he knew every halting line of dialog and every swooping camera-fugue by heart . Eventually , he attended German schools on a DAAD fellowship , and during his third year at his dead papa 's alma mater in Cologne , produced a highly regarded honor 's thesis , entitled Hegel , Kant , Marx and Adorno : When Is Too Much Not Enough ? which won him a State Arts Grant to Frankfurt , where he completed his baccalaureate at seventeen on the subject of Ossian . Since his arrival at F.U. , however , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this had not prevented him from mapping out so many ambitious lifetime projects that it made his advisor 's head hurt . " I am compiling notes for a trilogy on the failure of knowledge , " Heinrich breathlessly explained on their long afternoon walks to the Metro , while Dazzle just as breathlessly tried to outdistance him . " Then there is my history of Prussian Absolutism , my critique of Benjamin 's radical desubjectivization of spirit , an essay on the anxiety of essay-writing and , of course , my reschematization of German philosophy since Lessing , which should encompass at least twenty book-length manuscripts and lead me to the doorstep of my self-proposed lifetime project : to chart the intellectual DNA of God through the prose and poetry of every heterotext on the Internet . What do you think about that for a lifetime project , Herr Dazzle ? I realize it may sound excessively ambitious , but as you must know by now-if there 's one thing I 'm not afraid of , it 's excess . " Walking with Heinrich was like trying to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast you thought you were going , they were always a few steps ahead - even on two feet . " Do n't you ever get lonely , Heinrich ? " Dazzle asked one day when they found themselves slumped side by side on a leafy , convenient bus bench just short of the Metro . " Do n't you ever feel that you 're spending too many nights alone in your bed ? " " German women are afraid of commitments , " Heinrich replied sulkily , nostrils flaring . " Especially when it comes to making commitments with Heinrich . " " What about TV or movies , Heinrich ? Or even Nintendo ? Just something , you know , to get your mind off itself . " " German TV is nothing but bourgeois propaganda about the terrible , nonsensical traumas associated with being bourgeois . And as for American TV , forget it . Dreams of plenitude , twenty-four hours a day . And as you must realize , Herr Dazzle - those are n't the sort of dreams that fool me at all . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working with kids , or cleaning up the environment . You ca n't spend your entire life being obsessed with Liebestod , Heinrich . Especially when you have so much trouble just getting a date . " " Heinrich has no trouble getting dates . " " Okay , second dates . " " Making love is the death of desire . " " But it clears the head , Heinrich . It keeps you from thinking too hard about things you ca n't change . Like , you know . Yourself . " " Heinrich refuses to turn his back on the universe which today 's Germany does not wish to acknowledge . The universe of heartache , spiritual insufficiency and loss . " " Tristan and Isolde . " " Who told you about Tristan and Isolde ? " " I may be a dog , Heinrich , " Dazzle explained with a sigh . " But everybody 's heard of Tristan and Isolde . " When it came to unraveling the complex knot of human nature , Dazzle had limited means at his disposal . But sometimes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you have no idea what 's going on . " Heinrich is perfectly attractive , " conceded Agatha on the afternoon Dazzle asked her into his office for an informal chat . " And he certainly boasts the sort of passionate intelligence that a girl does n't often come across in our new , improved Germany . But at the same time , he 's a really tough date , especially with all his engines running . After an endless bus ride during which he continuously talks about Hegel , you end up at some badly lit cafeteria , where the rubber-gloved staff clearly find him offensive . And every time you try to change the subject to something interesting - such as your long-unconfessed ambitions to win the Euro-Vision Song Contest , or the latest episode of Friends - he just scowls terribly , as if you have hurled hot pasta in his face . He begins spouting Nietzsche or Holderlin , and raving about the mindless herds of contemporary culture . Pretty soon it 's nothing but " bourgeoisie-this " and " bourgeoisie-that , " and he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much trouble you went to with your hair . Once , I was so upset , I started crying into my bratwurst . And did he notice ? No , he did n't notice at all . But in answer to your question , I could actually imagine sleeping with Heinrich , or even accompanying him in a romantic manner to your highly publicized lecture at the Cross-Humanities Institute next week . But I 'm afraid I ca n't imagine doing these things until he learns how to shut his stupid mouth for more than two seconds . " Agatha was sitting with Dazzle in his office on the swaybacked , well-worn sofa , and aimlessly scratching his rump while she talked . Dazzle realized that this was probably not the sort of situation a professor should cultivate with his most attractive female student ( even if it was Europe ) , but then what the hey , he thought . It helped him think . " So what you 're saying , Agatha , is that you want to be with Heinrich . But only if he stops telling you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment . " I guess that 's what I am saying , Herr Dazzle . Does that sound superficial ? " Dazzle almost laughed . " No , Agatha , I do n't think it does . Especially when we 're talking about Heinrich . " Which was when Dazzle realized that he might have something to teach his students after all . " I think I resemble the funny , wacky , sometimes stupid-sounding one named Joey . Do n't I seem like Joey to you , Heir Doktor ? I certainly feel like Joey - now that I 'm getting to know him , that is . " It was quite amazing , Dazzle thought , how quickly these European types could pick up a totally new language . It was like dealing with chameleons or something . " Well , yeah , I guess so , Heinrich . Joey , right . And his hair 's always slightly disarranged in a kind of attractive fashion . Just like yours . " Heinrich pulled vainly at his crumpled locks . " And he always looks so baffled when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along . Like one of the other friends feels inclined toward him physically . Or two of his fellow friends are having an affair . He is very naive and easily astounded . Much like I feel myself to be almost all of the time . " " Boyish vulnerability , " Dazzled added , trying to help . " And innocence . Do n't forget innocence , Heinrich . " They had just finished screening the first three seasons in the audiovisual Common Room , where Dazzle was enjoying his best attendance of the term . The chairs and tables were full , and many students were sitting cross-legged on the linoleum . " Myself , " piped up Ingrid , a beautiful , fair-skinned Swiss woman who had n't uttered a single word before now , " I must confess strong feelings of similarity to the very sarcastic one with the blonde hair , though my own hair is far too curly and boring . I often aim my wicked barbs at people for no reason whatsoever , and many do not appreciate my characteristically bizarre sense of humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen before . Some of them were n't even listed on his register . " We especially enjoy their manifest looks of surprise when they awaken in each other 's beds . And no matter what sort of insurmountable problems they face - such as achieving personal space in their bathrooms , or the ominous threat of really attractive non-friends trying to break into the inner circle - they still feel total devotion to one another without exception , and raise their variously engendered ( and highly attractive ) offspring in total harmony . " " Except perhaps for that English girl . We have trouble accepting that a true friend would ever marry an English girl . " " It was doomed from the start . " " She hardly makes any subsequent appearances . " " She was nowhere near so entertaining as Scan Penn . " " Which brings us to a collective point of interest , Herr Dazzle , if you would n't mind - " After snoozing through the entire DVD marathon , Dazzle had awakened to a class buzzing with excited young men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Especially Agatha and Heinrich , who were sitting so close together that they almost touched . Dazzle even felt enough confidence to tackle the most troubling issue of the term : " I think I know where this is going , so let me reiterate for like the thousandth time . There 's nothing to those rumors about Sean Penn playing the lead in my life story . And I hate to disappoint you - but at this point in time ? I doubt if Sony will even renew the option . " It was never easy for Dazzle to tell when he had turned a potentially disastrous experience into a marginally successful one , but he was pretty sure the breakthrough occurred sometime during his presentation of the Seymour Fischer Lecture , which was held at the Modern Language Institute , conveniently located just across the street from the Mitte Metro . " First off , " Dazzle began , " I want to tell you all woof , and say that I 've had a terrific time during the last few months , woof woof . And just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you guys than you could ever learn from me , especially when it comes to language . For example , I 've learned that you guys really take language seriously , not simply as a means of expressing yourselves ( like most American mutts I know ) , but as a means of communicating with other cultures . You guys actually listen to other people , whatever country they 're from . I guess it 's the result of living on a continent with so many various languages and all , and everybody competing for the same euros and shelf-space . And so far as your canine - hey , stop apologizing ! For my money , you speak it as well as any dog , right down to the guttural diphthongs . Good going ! " The large audience of well-dressed , attractive men and women smiled a collective smile . ( When in doubt , just compliment these people on their language skills , Dazzle thought happily . It 's like turning on all the lights . ) " Anyway , " Dazzle continued , shouldering up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your country , or the things I 've learned while I was here . For example , I now realize that language is n't just a pile of words in a dictionary . Language is the air we breathe , and the food we eat , and the stories we tell when we 're together . Look , I know I can be pretty cynical and footsore about this crazy world , but there 's one thing I 've learned which gives me hope . Every effort to speak or listen is basically a good effort , so long as we keep trying . Which is , I guess , a long-winded way of saying thanks for having me . I had a terrific time . Oh- and one more thing . " The audience moved forward just a little to the edge of their chairs . Dazzle did n't think he 'd ever get used to it : the posture and intensity of almost-alien human beings listening . To him . ( What a trip , Dazzle thought . ) " Heizlichen Dank fr Ihre Wunderbare Gastfreundschaft , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken on the face of the planet . " And now , if you do n't mind , it 's time for me to go . "
