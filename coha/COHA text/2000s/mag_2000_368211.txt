Despite a string of international championships and honors like " world handball player of the century , " Magnus Wislander , captain of the two-time world champion Swedish handball team , may be best known for his other nickname : " the Snake . " He 's no Richard Hatch , though . In Wislander 's case , the title refers to an uncanny ability to slither through a field of opponents toward the goal . To get a grip on the sport , a popular one in Europe , think soccer using hands instead of feet , with some dribbling thrown in . Adept at both offense and defense , Wislander , 36 , is 10 years older than the average player . He leads an equally experienced team of thirtysomethings , many of whom have played together for a decade . The results ? Since his debut in 1985 , Wislander has scored 956 goals and led his team to three World Cups . To his chagrin , Croatia upset Sweden to win gold in Atlanta . Which is to say , beware old-timers seeking revenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plon/Copenhagen
