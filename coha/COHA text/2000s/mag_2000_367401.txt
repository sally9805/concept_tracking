Doris Dillon knew she wanted to be a teacher from the moment she was named library monitor in third grade . For years she practiced on every doll , stuffed animal and family pet . When she graduated to real elementary school students , so deftly did she zero in on each child 's learning style that it was said she could " teach a rock to read . " Parents pleaded to have their children placed in her classes . Colleagues copied her methods . For hundreds of schoolkids in San Jose , Calif. , Mrs. Dillon embodied some of their favorite fictional characters  --  Miss Rumphius , Ms. Frizzle and Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle , all rolled into one . She was a wizard with a delicious sense of fun who turned everything she touched into a teaching tool . So it seemed entirely in character that when she was struck with a catastrophic neuromuscular disease , she would use her tragedy as yet another lesson . <P> Dillon had shifted from classroom teaching to running the libraries at the Graystone and Williams elementary schools in San Jose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Doctors found she had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , also known as Lou Gehrig 's disease , after the baseball great who succumbed to it . There is no cure for ALS ; 80% of its victims die within five years of diagnosis . Yet once the diagnosis was confirmed in 1998 , Dillon 's first response was to write to the staff and the students ' families , explaining her illness and her determination to continue working . Their support has been unequivocal . Last year Williams Elementary named her Teacher of the Year , and Graystone dedicated its library to her . <P> Against the odds , Dillon , 56 , still exhibits much of the stamina that earned her the sobriquet Energizer Bunny as she arranges author visits , runs writing contests and helps kids find books they will like . But since June 1998 , she has had to give up the greatest joy of her job  --  reading aloud to children  --  because ALS has damaged the neurons that control speaking , chewing and swallowing . Read-alouds are now handled by volunteers . Eating will soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dillon communicates via e-mail ; several computers , including one that can " speak " her written words ; and a paper pad on which she writes exquisite script . She can still walk , and everywhere she goes , kids rush up to squeeze her hand or hug her . They know that she remains the same Mrs. Dillon , beloved for dressing up in costumes  --  not just for Halloween  --  and for putting sunflowers in every nook of the library . <P> Her colleagues talk frankly with their classes about her illness , emphasizing that even though Mrs. Dillon now has a disability , she is the same person inside that she has always been . On a recent Monday , teacher Shelly Bancroft read David Adler 's Lou Gehrig , the Luckiest Man to her fourth-graders , then led a group discussion . Katha Edwards ' class , which had read E.B. White 's The Trumpet of the Swan , about a bird without a voice , talked about Dillon 's muteness . Said a student : " Mrs. Dillon is brave . She has a disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
