<p> The Thanksgiving table offers a melange of dishes , sometimes tied together only by family tradition . Stuffing and stuffed guests are de rigueur . <p> Wine is usually sipped until it is time to cut the pumpkin pie . But there 's another level of dining decadence that fewer people experience  --  enjoying wine with dessert , or as a separate course before or after dessert . <p> Coming to consensus on which desserts make the turkey-day lineup can involve discussion and negotiation that would put the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks to shame . My family always reached an equitable solution - we served them all . <p> Thanksgiving desserts continue the rich-spicy-sweet holiday theme . Classics include cinnamon , clove and nutmeg-spiced pumpkin pie and sweet potato pie ; rich , slightly gooey pecan pie and apple pie . My family also often includes custard pie , chocolate bread pudding or a nutty , crunchy-topped fruit crisp . <p> Dessert wines  --  also known as " stickies , " particularly in Australia  --  <p> are just as varied , including sweet sparkling wines , late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like tawny port and fortified wines like vintage port . <p> When pairing desserts and dessert wines , first choose which is more important : the dessert or the wine . Is there a must-have dessert that 's a family tradition , or do you want to serve a specific dessert wine ? <p> No matter what , the wine should always be sweeter than the dessert . Otherwise , the wine can taste dull and acidic . This means that for good wine pairings , desserts should not be pure sugar-fests . Serve very sweet desserts with coffee and tea . <p> On their own , frozen desserts like sorbet and ice cream are n't perfect dessert wine partners either . The coldness dulls the palate and diminishes perception of the wine 's character . Ice cream is better with coffee than wine . <p> When you are having a sticky , a wine with similar flavors and aromas to those of the dessert makes a logical pairing . <p> Peter Palmer , wine director of the San Francisco restaurant Farallon , pairs Pumpkin Spice Bread Pudding that 's garnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walnuts and cinnamon chantilly cream with a Moscato Passito , a moderately sweet amber-colored Italian wine with spice and nut aromas and flavors . <p> But take away the pudding 's fancy garnishes and add just sweetened whipped cream and you change the dynamic . A vintage tawny port like a 1986 Delaforce Colheita Porto ( 500 ml , $33 ) will pair better without the caramel sauce , rum raisins and spiced walnuts that would overpower this delicate wine 's aromas and flavors of toasted nuts , dried fruit , vanilla and caramel . <p> Keith Jeanminette , pastry chef at Masa 's , San Francisco , says many of his pear and apple desserts pair well with the honied character of Muscat Beaumes-de-Venise , as do desserts with oranges , tangerines and apricots . <p> Masa 's sommelier Alan Murray pairs a moderately sweet French sparkling Gamay - his flexible dessert-wine choice  --  with sorbets , chocolate and fruit desserts . <p> Murray says , " Keith 's desserts are not too sweet because they follow long tasting menus and would otherwise overwhelm . " <p> John Ragan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit-centered wines to go with fruit desserts . <p> Ragan says , " For chocolate and caramel , I look for wines with some age and oxidation , like tawny port and Madeira . " <p> Taylor Fladgate 20 year old Tawny Porto ( 750 ml , $53 ) is golden-brown in color with a nose and palate of rich toasted nut , raisin and toffee ; its 20 percent alcohol adds to its rich , lush texture . <p> Contrasts can also work . Campton Place pastry chef Garrett Melkonian says Ragan does n't always go with the textbook pairing . Melkonian developed a ganache of Cuban chocolate with sweet potato puree , a sour orange and white chocolate sorbet and hazelnut foam . Ragan pairs it with a Trockenbeerenauslese ( German Riesling ) . <p> " The sour orange sorbet is very acidic and in your face , but the Riesling holds up to the acidity , " he says , " and the wine 's richness and caramel notes go with the chocolate . " <p> Another reason this unusual pairing works is because the dessert 's elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balanced . Like Jeanminette , Melkonian tries to keep his desserts at a moderate sweetness level so they 're easier to pair with dessert wines . <p> Sharing similar weight and intensity is as important for dessert and dessert wine pairing as it is for matching dry wine and food . Dark , intense , rich chocolate decadence cake needs a rich , fairly youthful vintage port with concentration , dark fruit , some tannins and occasional spice . The nuances of an older , smoother , more integrated vintage port would be overwhelmed by so much chocolate , but will support more moderate chocolate flavors , such as a chocolate-port sauce served with port-poached pears . <p> When asked what he thinks is his most versatile dessert wine , Farallon 's Palmer immediately says , " German eiswein . It 's straightforward , rich , sweet and concentrated with good acidity ; it 's not oaked and has no botrytis . It 's clean , refreshing and sweet enough to stand up to many desserts and can even be good with chocolate . " <p> One very versatile German eiswein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 375 ml , $55 ) . This medium-bodied wine has mineral , lush lemon-lime and ripe pear aromas and flavors ; it 's bright and clean with jazzy acidity , which moderates the impression of sweetness and concludes with a long , balanced finish . And it 's only 6.5 percent alcohol . <p> Once you understand the basic principles of dessert-wine pairing , you can easily create fun matches on your own . We 've provided a few recipes to get you started . Keep in mind that additional components on the plate , like garnishes and sauces , will change the ideal pairing . <p> The Fuyu Persimmon &; Goat Cheese Tart , Pear &; Fromage Blanc Crepes and Pear Upside-Down Polenta Cake are moderately sweet with ripe fruit , so they can pair with anything from a Moscato d'Asti to a late harvest Chenin Blanc or New York ice wine . <p> One wine perfect for these fruit desserts is the 2004 Fairview La Beryl Blanc Late Harvest Paarl Chenin Blanc ( 500ml , $25 ) from South Africa . The wine 's late-harvested grapes have also been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almond , honey and sweet herb flavors that combine with bright acidity in this lively wine , moderating its 23 percent residual sugar . <p> For wines closer to home , try 2002 Amity Vineyards Select Cluster Oregon Riesling ( 375 ml , $60 ) , 2002 Robert Mondavi Napa Valley Moscato d'Oro ( 375 ml , $20 ) , or 2001 Santa Barbara Winery Santa Ynez Valley Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc ( 375 ml , $16 ) . <p> If chocolate is needed on the table , whip up the Chocolate &; Nut-Filled Pastry and serve it with ruby port , young vintage port or late harvest Zinfandel . Port or late harvest red wine added to the chocolate ganache helps bring the match together . <p> Gorgonzola-Stuffed Dates combine salty , pungent cheese with toasty almonds or walnuts in another do-ahead dessert nibble that can also shine on a cheese display or as an hors d'oeuvre . The Gorgonzola lends salt to the sweet date , while the nut adds crunch ; using walnuts instead of almonds gives a hint of tannin , which can help offset tannins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and late harvest Zinfandel are other dessert wine choices for the stuffed dates . <p> In the Char family Thanksgiving tradition , there is a separate dessert table with a variety of fall desserts including something with fruit , a pecan pie , a traditional pumpkin pie , a custard pie and chocolate truffles . I 'll have a variety of dessert wines , including some I 've mentioned above . <p> I 'll know it 's a success if I hear that only-on-Thanksgiving question : <p> " I ca n't possibly eat one more bite , but may I have another slice of pie ?
