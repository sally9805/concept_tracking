<p> Each weekday at 4:30 a.m. , Frank Montgomery rolls down the driveway of his brand new home to begin the 70-minute trek to work at a Sunol water filtration plant in Alameda County . <p> Such commutes - are n't uncommon in the Bay Area , but Montgomery 's starting point is . Montgomery , a maintenance machinist , and his wife , Lynda , recently moved from Oakland to Patterson ( Stanislaus County ) , on the western edge of the Central Valley . <p> The distance from their jobs - she is a child development instructor at an occupational center in Fremont - may be inconvenient . The price , however , - was n't . For $267,000 they bought a nearly 3,000-square-foot home . <p> As median home prices in many parts of the Bay Area have soared above the $500,000 mark , despite a flagging economy , home buyers are flocking to more-affordable locales on the east side of the Diablo Range , including both longtime commuter towns like Tracy and Stockton and smaller cities like Patterson , Ripon ( San Joaquin County ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Home builders , faced with booming demand , are racing to complete scores of developments and buy more land . <p> The result : Counties within this fertile swath of land are changing rapidly as rows of apricot trees and lima beans give way to cul de sacs packed with two-story homes with three-car garages . <p> The housing boom , born out of the scarcity of affordable housing in the Bay Area , is boosting some cities ' tax revenue and helping alleviate some of the region 's chronic joblessness . <p> However , it is also raising nagging concerns about the social fabric of what could become California 's largest bedroom community . There also are concerns about the region 's environment , which many say is already in precarious shape . <p> In addition , the growth has important implications for valley politics , specifically , land-use policy . <p> According to demographic forecasts , the population of the Northern San Joaquin Valley - Merced , San Joaquin and Stanislaus counties , which have seen the most spillover from the Bay Area - will explode by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The population in those three counties is expected to surge from a total of 1.2 million in 2000 to about 1.9 million in 2020 . The population of the Bay Area will also grow , but at a far lower rate , about 21 percent - from 6.9 million in 2000 to 8.3 million in 2020 . <p> In that same time period , San Francisco 's population is expected to contract by 4 percent , to 755,800 . <p> " There 's just not enough land in the Bay Area to accommodate the growth there , and it 's very expensive , so there 's a lot of pressure and people are moving out of there to the Central Valley , " said Sid Dunmore , chief executive of Dunmore Homes , a large home builder in the Central Valley . <p> To be sure , if the state 's economy continues to founder , home building in the Central Valley may dip , as has happened during previous , protracted downturns . Some observers think that might be starting now . <p> " I would expect the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really - did n't happen until late 2002 , " said Michael Teitz , program director for the economy program at the Public Policy Institute of California . Still , Teitz expects that in the long term , population growth will continue to fan out from the Bay Area , buoying housing demand . <p> All told , more than 7,500 new homes were sold in Merced , San Joaquin and Stanislaus counties in 2002 , more than double the 3,148 sold in 1997 . <p> During that same period , the total number of new homes sold in Contra Costa , San Francisco and Santa Clara counties combined shrank by 10 percent , from 6,957 to 6,231 , according to DataQuick , a La Jolla ( San Diego County ) real estate information company . <p> The changing landscape of the state 's interior is gaining notice from all quarters . In 1997 , the David and Lucile Packard Foundation , the James Irvine Foundation and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation formed the Great Valley Center , a nonprofit group dedicated to building support for the region . <p> More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Realtors in October , the group 's economist , Leslie Appleton-Young , called the Central Valley " the last frontier of California . " <p> Traditionally , the East Bay was an important housing safety valve , a place where first-time home buyers , in particular , could get into the market . But as the late 1990s dot-com mania drove land and home costs sky high throughout the Bay Area , home buyers found themselves looking farther east . <p> Officials at the Great Valley Center , which studies the 450-mile-long stretch from Bakersfield to Redding , have taken to calling the counties abutting Alameda , Contra Costa and Santa Clara counties the Greater East Bay , a nod to the Bay Area consumers who are broadening their geographic search for housing . <p> As an informal adjunct to the East Bay , Merced , San Joaquin and Stanislaus counties have seen median home prices rise dramatically . According to DataQuick , the median prices in those three counties have increased roughly 73 percent , 82 percent and 82 percent , respectively , in the past five years . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break the $250,000 barrier . <p> Compared with the median price of homes in the Bay Area , where many counties are built out or have placed strict limits on growth , homes in the Northern San Joaquin Valley look downright cheap . <p> In San Francisco , the median home price is about $545,000 , a roughly 92 percent increase in the past five years . The rise in Contra Costa County - has n't been as steep - 78 percent - but the current median there is still about $401,000 , or $120,000 more than the median in San Joaquin County , according to DataQuick . <p> That gap - was n't lost on the Montgomerys , who bought their home in September . Among their top criteria , after price , was space . After living in a 1,300-square-foot house in Oakland for several years , they wanted a place where they could entertain their grown son and two daughters during visits . <p> " For what we wanted in that price range , we knew we 'd have to go out of the Bay Area , " Lynda Montgomery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family gatherings without feeling cramped . <p> From the home building industry 's standpoint , the equation is simple . The Central Valley has much larger tracts of affordable , developable land than the Bay Area . And the approval process can take far less time than it takes in say , Marin or San Mateo counties , where more-vociferous environmental groups often oppose new housing based on increased traffic or environmental impacts , according to Carol Whiteside , president of the Great Valley Center . <p> Patterson real estate agent Shane Donlon recently sold a chunk of farmland to a developer for about $35,000 per acre . The builder is planning to build six homes on each acre . <p> Fifty miles away in Pleasanton , a 1-acre lot would run roughly $1.5 million , according to the Homebuilders Association of Northern California . An acre in San Francisco or San Jose could easily sell for $3 million or more , according to the group . <p> Home builders in the Central Valley pass those savings on to the buyer , resulting in lower home prices . At KB Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prices start at $505,420 . At its Meadowlands subdivision in Los Banos ( Merced County ) , new homes start at $192,500 . <p> Pollution and other problems <p> Environmental experts say there are other costs . As more homes sprout in the Central Valley for people who work in Redwood City or Oakland , traffic will inevitably increase , spewing more pollutants into the air , they say . <p> Central Valley air quality already fails to meet federal standards for ozone and particulates - dust and other minute , potentially harmful compounds that float in the air . In December , Central Valley residents were asked to refrain from using their fireplaces and woodstoves because of the particulate matter in wood smoke . <p> In 2000 , vehicles in the Central Valley logged 82.4 million miles every day , compared with 34.8 million miles in 1981 . If trends continue , researchers expect that figure to reach 127.8 million miles by 2010 , according to the San Joaquin Air Pollution Control District in Fresno . <p> " Anything that gets people to drive more is going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldberg , education specialist at the Fresno center . <p> Longtime Central Valley residents fret about the long-term effects of extended commutes on the community . <p> Ben Leonard , a physician who moved to Gustine ( Merced County ) 49 years ago , said he sees the stress-related health effects of 80- to 100-mile , one-way commutes every day . <p> The commute " is taking a toll on many of them . I see a good deal of it in my practice , " Leonard said in an e-mail . " If they go back ( to the Bay Area ) , they - ca n't afford it . But if they stay , they eat away at their health . It 's a no-win situation . " <p> But for buyers , the low cost of housing is paramount . Sales agents at new subdivisions from Los Banos to Lodi ( San Joaquin County ) say the same thing : Easily 80 percent of their visitors are Bay Area residents thrilled by the idea of paying less than $300,000 for a 2,000-square-foot house . <p> Barbara Karvonen , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her son recently looked at several new homes in Los Banos , west of Merced , and Manteca ( San Joaquin County ) , south of Stockton . <p> To be sure , Karvonen was worried about her commute , which could top an hour and a half each way . But if she moves to Los Banos , Karvonen might cut her workweek to four 10-hour days to reduce her time on the road . <p> " I 'm absolutely sure I 'll hate it , but I - do n't see any other way , " she said , noting that her dream house , a 2,255-square-foot , two-story in Los Banos , was listed for $239,000 . <p> Changing racial mix <p> Frank Montgomery has struggled with another aspect of living far from a big city . When he first moved to Patterson , Montgomery - could n't find a local barber skilled in cutting African Americans ' hair . So every three weeks , he makes an appointment in Oakland to get his hair trimmed . <p> That 's a minor inconvenience , but it highlights how the influx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Central Valley for generations to come . It also points to the negatives of living far away from the artistic and cultural amenities of a large urban center . <p> Currently , in the entire 18-county Central Valley there are about 5.6 million residents : about 3 million caucasians , 1.7 million Latinos , 376,000 Asians , 283,400 African Americans and 49,500 American Indians , according to the Great Valley Center . <p> According to the Central California Futures Institute in Fresno , the Latino population in the San Joaquin Valley ( Fresno , Kern , Kings , Madera , Mariposa , Merced , San Joaquin , Stanislaus and Tulare counties ) will increase from 37 percent in 2000 to 41 percent in 2010 , mirroring similar growth in the state . <p> The caucasian population will shrink to 44 percent from 50 percent . <p> As a result , economists like Robert Fountain , director of the Sacramento Regional Research Institute , expect wholesale political changes in the Central Valley within a few short years . <p> " When the old farmer dies , things turn over real fast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I 'll sell ( my land ) over my dead body . ' And his children agree . " <p> Fountain believes the growing Latino population , in particular , will have a lasting effect on the Central Valley landscape . <p> " It 's the wealthy , white , established landowners who want agricultural preservation , " he said . " The only hope for ( the Latino population ) is an industrialized model . " <p> Although much of the farmland in the Central Valley falls under the Williamson Act - a 1965 measure that decreases farmers ' property taxes by about a third in exchange for continued agricultural production for 10 years - Central Valley experts said many ranchers choose to sell when they reach the end of their contract . <p> Donlon , the real estate agent , also farms about 300 acres in and around Patterson . Two decades ago , his tomatoes used to fetch about $55 per ton . Today , he pulls in about $47 per ton . <p> Land rush <p> " A lot of farmers are quitting , selling land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets calls every day from developers who want to buy " small pieces of land , large pieces - anything and everything . " <p> Not every almond orchard will be plowed under to make room for another new subdivision . Several communities in San Joaquin County have placed caps on the number of residential permits issued each year . <p> In Manteca , for instance , the number of permits is limited to 3.9 percent of the previous year 's housing stock - about 700 per year . <p> " We - did n't want the city undergo rampant residential growth , but steady , concentric pattern of growth , " said Kyle Kollar , Manteca planning director . <p> Still , Fountain said the demand for housing may prove too strong . <p> " When development goes up against agriculture , agriculture loses , " he said . <p> Kathryn Maffei , a 54-year-old music teacher in Gustine ( Merced County ) , lived about 1.5 miles outside of town as a child . <p> " The only thing between my house and town were orchards , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all going to be housing . ' And it is . " <p> " I go into town and I - do n't know anyone anymore , " she added . <p> Realizing that their cities may become bedroom communities for San Jose and San Francisco workers , some towns in the Northern San Joaquin Valley are spending millions to spruce up their downtowns and attract jobs . <p> Merced recently landed the newest University of California campus , expected to be a significant lift to the economy , which was hit by the loss of 7,000 jobs after the closure of Castle Air Force Base in 1995 . The town has been less successful in luring other jobs , in part because of the faltering economy . <p> " There were huge drumbeats about Silicon Valley firms , but with the dot-bomb , the bloom is off that rose , " said Whiteside , of the Great Valley Center . <p> Fountain , the economist , said that may not be the norm for long . While the Bay Area remains a leader in high-tech research and development , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distribution bases in the next decade . <p> Whiteside is hoping that such jobs will boost annual pay in the Central Valley . Median household incomes in Merced , San Joaquin and Stanislaus counties in 1999 were $35,532 , $41,282 , and $40,101 , respectively . The statewide median was $47,493 , according to the California Department of Finance . <p> ' The two valleys ' <p> Although home construction and retail provide thousands of positions , they are seasonal and do little to offset the 10-percent-plus unemployment rates in cities like Merced and Modesto . <p> At the Great Valley Center , Whiteside and her colleagues are completing a set of broad-based forecasts for the region , which will be released later this year . <p> In one scenario called " The Two Valleys , " the Central Valley and coastal areas diverge . The Bay Area becomes home to affluent , caucasians who live in gated communities . The Central Valley becomes home to a large number of minorities who live at " at a more subsistence level , " Whiteside said . <p> Under " The New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reduce traffic , preserve farmland , safeguard the environment and attract people from various socioeconomic backgrounds . <p> " The reason why what 's happening in the Central Valley is so important is that the Bay Area and Los Angeles are already done . They 've been fundamentally shaped and built . The valley is still in the process , so we have a chance , " Whiteside said . <p> " Will we just go blindly down the path and recreate the same problems we 've done in other places ? Or will we learn from other places that have made mistakes and create a different outcome ? The next eight to 10 years will tell . " <p> E-mail Kelly Zito at kzito@sfchronicle.com.
