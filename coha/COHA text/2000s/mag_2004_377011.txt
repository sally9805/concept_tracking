It 's hard to find much wrong with a drug that can battle fatigue and improve creativity and could even help prevent Parkinson 's disease and diabetes . It 's also hard to find much right with a drug that elevates blood pressure , aggravates stress , causes insomnia and leads to addiction . When both drugs are the same thing , it 's hard to know what to think . <P> That 's the rap  --  and the rep  --  associated with caffeine , the recreational chemical of choice for nearly 60% of Americans . But what of the received wisdom is true ? Is caffeine a scourge , a tonic , a little bit of both ? <P> One thing 's for certain : we sure love the stuff . There are 167 million coffee drinkers in the U.S. , and they consumed nearly 6.3 billion gal . last year alone . The average drinker admits to 3.4 cups a day , although the National Coffee Association is studiously vague about what constitutes a cup  --  deliberately , perhaps , in an era in which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On top of our coffee , we poured down 2.4 billion gal . of tea in 2003 , not all of which was gentle herbals . Biggest of all are carbonated soft drinks , 70% of which are caffeinated . Americans consumed a stunning 15.3 billion gal . in 2003 , or 574 cans for every man , woman and child . <P> The good news is that not only does all that caffeine not necessarily hurt but in some ways it may help . Java 's famous energy jolt is no illusion , improving performance on tasks and helping people stay alert . That , however , requires drinking caffeine the right way , and most people do n't , loading up first thing in the morning and then crashing by the afternoon , when the chemical  --  with a half-life of up to six hours  --  is leaving the system . <P> Better , says sleep researcher James Wyatt of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago , to consume a little caffeine in the morning and continue to take it in very small doses throughout the day . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical that helps trigger sleep . In a recent study , Wyatt and others tested that theory , comparing a group of volunteers taking low , steady caffeine doses with subjects who got none at all . The caffeinated group indeed performed better on cognitive tests , with no late-day crash . ( Though p.m. caffeine may not do much for your ability to sleep when you want to . ) <P> In another area of study entirely , some research suggests that caffeine may help prevent Parkinson 's disease and Type 2 diabetes . Using data gathered in an 18-year health survey of 125,000 men and women , Meir Stampfer , professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health , found that coffee drinkers had lower incidences of both diseases , though the benefit was a bit less pronounced for Parkinson 's . He concedes that the work is preliminary , particularly in light of other studies that show caffeine worsens diabetes in people who already have it . But he is convinced that further studies of possible therapeutic effects may lead to treatments . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " to figure out why caffeine is working this way . "
