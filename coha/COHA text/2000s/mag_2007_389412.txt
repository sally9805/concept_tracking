Is it possible for someone who is n't a media mogul or a lottery winner to retire at 50 ( or so ) ? Yes . Five people explain how they did just that  --  and how they made the transition to the next stage . JOHN GREENE Age : 75 Retirement age : 54 Residence : Pine Plains , N.Y . Career : Trader FOR ABOUT 30 YEARS I was a specialist on the floor of the American Stock Exchange . The unwritten rule was that when you turned 50 , you were out . I was a few years past that when I decided to leave before they dropped the ax . I left in September of 1987 , shortly before the crash . That was sheer luck . Right after I retired , I was in a sculpture class , and the market was down 500 points . I had a headset on , and a classmate asked , " What are you listening to ? " I said , " I 'm listening to the Dow . " And she said , " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another life . I have owned a 1790 farmhouse in the Hudson Valley since 1971 , and when I decided to retire , my wife and I built a large studio addition . I began to paint and sculpt in earnest , something I had always done but never had the time or energy to focus on . I spend about five days a week in the studio , and have had more than 30 exhibitions at galleries in New York , Connecticut , Massachusetts , and Palm Beach . The money I earn from selling my work , I use to collect the work of other artists . I GET MONTHLY INCOME from leasing my three seats on the Amex . My wife , Gwen , who is in private client services at Bear Stearns , manages the balance of my money , rolling over my 401(k) into an IRA and investing my assets in bonds ( 25% ) and equities ( 50% ) , and the balance in hedge and private-equity funds . Painting is not just keeping me busy . It is a transfer of commitment . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , it 's not going to be the same level of satisfaction . NANCY MUELLER Age : 63 Retirement age : 55 Residence : Palo Alto Career : Small-business owner THIS IS REALLY my second retirement . In 1972 , I stopped working as a chemist after my second child was born and started volunteering at a nonprofit restaurant that served quiche . That got me thinking about the need for appetizers . So in 1977 , I started to package petite quiche appetizers and sell them to local grocery stores . In 1983 we got placement in Price Club and later in Sam 's Club . We grew as they grew . My lifelong dream with my husband , a venture capitalist who never planned to stop working , was to someday sail the world . When he died in 1994 , my business , Nancy 's Specialty Foods , was n't terribly big . By 1999 , I had 350 employees , almost $60 million in revenues , and could make 11/2 million petite quiches in a day . But I was physically exhausted and ready for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hired an investment bank and sold the business in 1999 for a price that allowed me to finance building a boat and retiring . Now my money is in a smorgasbord of assets , managed by a financial consultant who makes sure I am diversified enough to weather market ups and downs . AS FOR THE BOAT , it is 140 feet long and accommodates eight guests . I just got back from Vanuatu and will leave shortly for Western Samoa and Tonga . I am on it between six and seven months a year , almost always with friends . I love being on the boat , and I love photography , on land and underwater . As fate would have it , I am also a grandmother to three boys and a girl , and I like to see my 89-year-old mother , so I have the opposite pull on land . I spend a lot of time on airplanes . When I first retired , a group of my retired friends sat me down and said , " Nancy , do n't give your time away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but my personality is , if I can do nine things , why ca n't I do ten ? I like being busy . CONNIE DAVIES Age : 52 Retirement age : 50 Residence : Gilbert , Ariz . Career : Phone company manager I DID N'T ANTICIPATE retiring quite this early . I started as a repair technician at Michigan Bell when I was in my early 20s ; after a lot of mergers , by the time I retired , I was a midlevel manager at Qwest Communications , overseeing implementation and repair for some of our biggest clients . Over time the corporate culture changed . So when I became pension eligible on my 50th birthday , I thought about it long and hard , counted up all my pennies , and realized , " I do n't have to do this anymore ! " There are no two ways about it : Retiring is scarier as a single woman . Housing , utilities , property taxes  --  none of this costs any less on a single income . My son and daughter live with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 23 , is applying to an MBA program . They also both work . I make sure the home front is going so that when they have some downtime they can relax . I do cooking and starching of shirts . I am an odd person , in that ironing does n't bother me ! I miss the day-to-day camaraderie of being on the job , but not having a schedule is really nice . Next year I am going to start to travel . I have more than a half-million air miles from traveling for work , so that should get me going nicely . WHEN I RETIRED , Qwest Communications was teetering on the verge of bankruptcy . I had a defined-benefit plan that was worth $520,000 . I took that as a lump sum and rolled it into an IRA at Charles Schwab . I also had a 401(k) with about $275,000 in it , which I had started at a young age , increasing my contribution to 15% in the last five years of my employment . The safe withdrawal rate from a retirement account is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you are golden . My investments have grown to more than $1.1 million . I live on investments and after-tax savings . I have not yet touched my pension or 401(k) . I used a financial advisor for about a year after retirement ; now I am pretty much an individual investor , reading a lot of financial-planning materials . I am basically 100% into mutual funds , but I am getting ready to get into stock picking . There is no one more interested in my financial security than me . BRUCE ENTIN Age : 56 Retirement age : 53 Residence : Los Gatos , Calif . Career : Tech company CEO I DO N'T LIKE the word " retired . " Saying " retired " is like looking in the rearview mirror . The reality is , I do a little bit of everything . I had an unconventional career path . I started as a journalist , did corporate public relations , investor relations , became head of marketing for a chip company , ran two divisions , and finally was CEO of a startup chip company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company was sold a year later to Broadcom . I always thought I would retire at 59 , when my last child was out of college . But I started filling my calendar with nonwork things , and the job opportunities that did come up were not exciting . I gravitated into thinking , " What else can I do ? " I wanted to give back to my community . I am now a board member of the Santa Clara Valley Red Cross and the San Jose Jewish Film Festival , and I am a member of a county advisory bicycle and pedestrian commission . I also had the opportunity to manage a shelter in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina . I 'm not someone who hit the Silicon Valley jackpot , so I ca n't say I do n't think about money . I wake up and there are bills to pay , a daughter to support in college , and unforeseen expenses as well . But we have squared it away with an income stream from savings and investments ; I also do some management consulting on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is lower . These are tradeoffs . My wife would have liked me to stop working even sooner . She encourages me to march to my own drum . And my kids were like , " Hey , Dad , go for it . " NO MATTER HOW MUCH money you have , you ca n't buy time . I have a year-old granddaughter , Leora . I did n't think I would be one of those doting grandparents , but I was smitten the first moment I saw her . I ca n't get enough of her . People ask me , " What did you do all day ? " I 've met people , may have done some consulting , gone biking , seen my kids , had coffee with my wife . The day seems to go by . And I ask myself , " What did n't I do today ? " DOUG NORDMAN Age : 46 Retirement age : 41 Residence : Mililani , Hawaii Career : Officer , U.S. Navy AFTER 20 YEARS of active service in the military , you can retire with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've read that more than 85% of officers who retire start a second career . I went through all the assessments , which said I should be a nuclear engineer or a midlevel manager . That was pretty much what I was doing . I was griping about it to my dad , and he asked , " Did n't you save anything over the last 20 years ? " I had never thought of that before . So in June 2002 , after my 20 years were up , I retired . My wife and I have always tracked our expenses and lived below our means . We were able to figure out what our expenses would be , and we have a portfolio large enough to sustain us through the remainder of our lives . Part of that is in a Thrift Savings Plan , which is like a 401(k) for government and military employees . I also receive $36,000 a year from my pension , which covers our mortgage , groceries , and most other expenses . My wife , who was also in the Navy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as $15,000 a year , though usually it is much less . Health care and inflation are solved by the military . The pension comes with a cost-of-living adjustment , and you get cheap health insurance  --  $460 a year covers the family . What are you going to do all day ? I call it being responsible for your own entertainment . Now I have the chance to do all the things I have always wanted to do . There is surfing , for example . I check the surf every morning . If the day is going to be good for surf , it does n't matter what home improvement projects I might have on my to-do list  --  I adjust my day to allow for a few hours for surfing . I got ta have my priorities ! Boredom has never been a problem . My daughter , who is 14 , has turned into a surf monster , so on her days off or the weekend we 're both down there . I HAVE BEEN GROWING my hair since the day I retired . The joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having haircuts . For 40 years  --  first at home , then in the military  --  people told me how long my hair had to be . This is the first time in my life that I was ever in charge of my own hair length . It sounds silly , but it is my version of a teenage rebellion and a midlife crisis , all at once .
