Photograph above : Lavender-pink blooms of Eastern redbuds celebrate spring in Staunton , Virginia , left : Shorter and shrubbier than other redbuds , Chinese redbud smothers its branches with rosy-purple blooms . // Its spring blooms dazzle like a laser . It grows practically anywhere for anybody . It suits all sizes and styles of gardens . It 's a redbud . With qualities like these , when you say redbud , you 've said it all . Redbud gets its name from its singular habit of sprouting deep rosecolored flowerbuds directly from its twigs , branches , and trunk in early spring before the leaves appear . In horticulture , we call this phenomenon " cauliflory , " a term that confuses me , given that redbud blooms ( which are edible ) taste more like peas . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lavender , pink , or white buds . More than one redbud species merits consideration , so let me assist your decision-making . Photograph Flowers appear before the leaves in early spring and range in color from rosy-purple to lavender to white . // Eastern Redbud Even if you 've never heard its name , you 're probably already familiar with our native Eastern redbud ( Cercis canadensis ) . Its distinctive lavender-pink blooms decorate neighborhoods , roadsides , stream banks , and open woodlands just before the dogwoods blossom . Quickly growing into a rounded , single- or multitrunked tree 20 to 30 feet tall and wide , Eastern redbud dresses itself in large heart-shaped leaves that change from deep green in summer to bright yellow or yellow-green in fall . Although many people plant trees that were grown from seeds , planting a named selection allows you to choose a particular flower color , leaf color , or growth habit . For example , ' Appalachian Red ' offers deep rose blooms , ' Rubye Atkinson ' presents clear pink flowers , and the blossoms of ' Alba ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reddish-purple foliage in spring , while white-splotched leaves distinguish ' Silver Cloud ' all summer . Dwarf ' Covey ' combines lavender flowers with twisted , pendulous branches . Texas Redbud Texas redbud ( C. canadensis texensis , formerly C. reniformis ) is basically just an Eastern redbud with thicker skin . A glossy , wax coating on its deep green leaves reduces moisture loss , helping it cope with the Southwest 's hot , dry climate . But do n't reject it if you live in the Southeast . It grows just as well there . Photograph top : Redbuds provide more than flowers . The leaves of ' Forest Pansy ' emerge reddish-purple in spring . above : ' Silver Cloud ' shows off green leaves frosted with white . Photograph A grouping of Texas redbuds offers spring color and summer shade to this San Antonio garden . These trees are popular in the Southwest because they tolerate drought and alkaline soil . // My favorite Texas redbud is called Oklahoma , ' a bit of irony that Longhorns fans do n't appreciate . But all is forgiven once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy selections include ' Texas White ' ( pure white blooms ) and ' Traveller ' ( similar to ' Covey ' but boasting pretty rose-purple blooms ) . Chinese Redbud Seldom planted-for some reason that I ca n't fathom-Chinese redbud ( C. chinensis ) is the showiest of all . So electric are its rosy-purple blooms in spring that , according to my sources , an alien peering down from space was once overheard saying , " Hey , Org , I 've discovered a big wall in China . see ? Over there , right next to that redbud . " Upright and shrubby with slightly smaller leaves than its cousins , Chinese redbud grows slowly to about 10 feet tall and wide . If you can find a selection called ' Avondale , ' buy it . It blooms so profusely that you ca n't see the branches . In the Garden Few trees are as versatile as redbuds in the landscape . You can plant them in alles ( rows lining a drive or walk ) or at the corners of foundation plantings . Group them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or beneath tall pines and hardwoods . ' Covey , ' ' Traveller , ' and ' Avondale ' also look great placed in planters . San Antonio landscape architect John Troy likes pairing the purple-pink flowers of redbud with the blue-purple flowers of Texas mountain laurel ( Sophora secundiflora ) . Landscape designer Jan Kirsh of St. Michaels , Maryland , combines white redbud with heartleaf bergenia ( Bergenia cordifolia ) and mixes lavender redbud with the purple or white spring blooms of money plant ( Lunaria annua ) . Parting Remarks Redbuds grow everywhere except for the Tropical South . They like almost any well-drained soil , although Texas redbud is better for alkaline soil . Full sun with light afternoon shade is ideal . Do any pruning immediately after the flowers fade . <p>
