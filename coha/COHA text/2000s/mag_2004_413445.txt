Everybody at Sony Pictures says they re happy-the top boss , the various sub-bosses , the would-be bosses . As the studio faces a critical summer , the only question is : Who 's in charge ? // DURING A MEETING with his division chiefs a couple of years ago , Sir Howard Stringer was called from the room . About twenty minutes later , he returned . " Boy , did I get my ass chewed out by the guys in Tokyo , " he told his executives good-humoredly . Stringer did n't explain why his bosses at Sony were displeased . But that kind of cheerful self-deprecation is one of the Sony executive 's pronounced and very ingratiatingtraits . And it has served him well , despite the occasional ass chewing . Having started in 1997 overseeing nothing in particular , Stringer , a sixty-two-year-old Welshman , has risen rapidly to the highest rank held by any non-Japanese in Sony 's history . He is vice-chairman of the company and runs the firm 's American electronics and entertainment operations . The ass chewing from the guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported to have endured from underling Amy Pascal as he anointed her chairman of Sony 's motion-picture group in December . After many tumultuous years at the studio , Pascal finally got the title she wanted . But at the same time , Stringer stunned the entertainment industry-as well as Pascal and her colleagues-by appointing AOL executive Michael Lynton as chairman and chief executive of Sony Pictures Entertainment . The net effect was that it left Pascal , forty-five , in charge of production but not the critically important areas of marketing and distribution , even as Sony plots for a muchneeded big summer movie season , led by its Spider-Man sequel . She is the only studio chairman so situated . Yet after the initial shock wore off this winter , Pascal , a well-liked if highstrung executive , clearly decided to make the best of things . In an at-times awkward interview with Lynton present , Pascal confirms that she declined to report to her new ... colleague . Nevertheless , " Michael is my partner . I 'm the happiest girl in the world . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick to insist that she 's the one picking the movies . Lynton , forty-four , who comes from overseeing AOL 's international operations , suggests that he 'll collaborate without being intrusive . And he is n't entirely lacking in studio experience : he oversaw the unsuccessful Hollywood Pictures film division at Disney from 1992 until it was folded in 1996 . Soft-spoken and affable , he made many more friends than enemies during his earlier stay . But insiders are finding it hard to figure what qualifies him to do ... whatever it is that he 's supposed to do at Sony . " I 'm actually a Michael Lynton fan , " says a leading agent . " But even in that context , I do n't get it . I have n't called him because I do n't know what to say . " Welcome back and what are you doing ? ' " Lynton and Pascal say the answer is obvious to them . And perhaps in the coming weeks , it will become obvious to everyone else . If not , it means that Pascal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what has long been the most opaque management structure in the movie business . And that is only one part of the enormous frustration at the studio . all of which leads back to the question of Stringer 's role in shapingthe place since he took the reins in 1998 . Despite his personal success at Sony , Stringer appears to be presiding over a shriveling empire when it comes to the company 's entertainment operations . Sony is hardly alone in facing a declining music business . And when it comes to filmed entertainment , it stood on the sidelines while other media companies engaged in a frenzy of vertical integration . Some of those deals turned out badly , to be sure , but the result is that unlike its rivals-Fox , Disney , Viacom , TimeWarner , the soon-to-bemerged Universal-Sony does n't own a network , broadcast or cable . In that difficult competitive environment , Sony all but dropped out of television production and then re-established itself only as a boutique operation . The film studio , which had a record-breaking year in 2002 , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convergence of Sony 's electronics side and its content factories-the rationale for the acquisition of the studio in the first place-has yet to materialize in a meaningful way . How many of these problems can be laid at Stringer 's feet ? To his detractors inside and outside Sony , Stringer 's primary success has been managing his own relationship with his bosses . Others say he 's done the best he can working for employers who are literally and culturally a world apart and who have pressing problems in their core businesses . " Howard 's just a little cogin the machine , " says a former top Sony Pictures executive . " I think he 's doing the job they hired him to do . all these people who say , " He 's not doing this , he 's not doing that ' ' - they 're missingthe point entirely . Nothing has ever happened there since Sony bought it . They just did n't have any vision for it . " WHEN STRINGER took over , Sony was still in the burn ward . Having bought Columbia Pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most notorious chapters in Hollywood business history . Sony paid a king 's ransom to hire flimflam men Peter Guber and Jon Peters to run the studio . The two did a fine remodeling job but ran the studio into a $3.2 billion writedown . Whatever the studio 's problems today , its executives are fond of pointing out that things have improved since then . According to a top Sony Pictures executive , it is hard to overstate the lingering effects of the trauma suffered by the Japanese and their resulting reluctance to get further entangled in the media world . In 1996 , Sony chairman Nobuyuki Idei opted for safety by bringing in veteran John Galley to run the studio . Galley 's elegance of demeanor and intellect must have been soothing indeed . But under Galley , who was sixty-six when he took the job , the studio seemed to drift . Calley installed Pascal as president of Columbia Pictures . For a time , it looked as though she would n't survive a series of bombs . Yet in 1999 , Galley promoted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplifying management , the place was still a thicket of executives and confusing relationships . Eventually , however , Pascal played a key role in turning things around . The film studio had a banner year in 2002 , with hits including Spider-Man and Panic Room . By then , Idei had put Stringer in place . A documentary producer , Stringer had risen through the ranks at CBS to become president of the CBS Broadcast Group in 1988. just how successful the network was during this era-and who deserves the creditcould be the subject of a doctoral thesis . But Stringer was already putting his formidable social skills to use . ( He is best known for wooing David Letterman to the network . ) " He is so smooth , " says an executive who ran a rival network at the time . " I always called him the Vice-president , dinner . ' " In 1995 , Stringer 's friend Michael Ovitz persuaded him to run Tele-TV , ajoint venture formed by three phone companies to generate programming that would be transmitted over phone lines . The venture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the switch to Sony . he had no experience in electronics , and until Sony came a-courting , he had never visited Japan . But like Galley , Stringer was charming and polished . He put an appealing face on Sony 's American operations . Even before Stringer assumed control of the studio , the sense of Galley 's growing disengagement was so pronounced that his retirement was the subject of constant speculation . But Stringer did not try to fix what was not manifestly broken . While permitting Pascal 's promotion to chairman of Columbia , he also bestowed an extraordinarily rich deal on producer Joe Roth , who was then startinghis company , Revolution Studios . Thanks to that arrangement , Roth , a former chairman of the Disney and Fox studios , was almost universally perceived to be Stringer 's choice to run the studio when Galley passed the torch . The advent of the Joe Roth shadow government added another layer to the complex and confusing management arrangements . Meanwhile , executives with vaunted titles came and went . Seriously anticipating Galley 's retirement , Sony created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film operation : Pascal , distribution chief Jeff Blake , and Yair Landau , who oversees television and digital operations . Six months later , Stringer also created a seven-member operating committee to advise the vice-chairmen and monitor costs . Known within the company as the Seven Samurai , its members include Roth and Stringer himself . Confused yet ? Last October , Galley finally retired . The three vice-chairmen seemed to be alone at the wheel , with Pascal controlling film production . Sony declared for the umpteenth time that its management structure had been simplified . But still more " simplification " was in store . Stringer praised Pascal publicly and told the media that he was " not planning on any immediate change . " In fact , Stringer had already started hush-hush talks with Lynton . Within weeks , Sony 's top management was shocked to learn that there was a new boss . The result is yet another peculiar arrangement . Pascal has inherited Galley 's capacious old office and reports to Stringer , while her vice-chairmen report to Lynton . It must seem strange to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disasters on the Sony release schedule in the past year came not from her shop but from that Joe Roth deal engineered by Stringer . It was Roth , not Pascal , who greenlighted Gigli , Holly wood Homicide , Radio , and The Missing . Asked about this , Pascal magnanimously observes that Roth had a bad year and looks to prosper in the months ahead . Some in Hollywood have speculated that part of Lynton 's mission is to get rid of Roth 's deal . A Roth executive says that 's not going to be possible contractually for at least two more years . Lynton says that the movie studio is in good shape and that his mandate is to look at other operations and work on such issues as stemming piracy . But most Hollywood observers think that he is also expected to clamp down on spending . Even those who respect Pascal 's talent as a hands-on film executive think she could use some help in the area of fiscal restraint . As one producer with ties to Sony puts it , " Everyone knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not her strength . It 's not her interest . " In fact , Sony has had some disappointments with its expensive sequels Charlie 's Angels : Full Throttle tmdBad Boys II , and the cost of this summer 's SpiderMan installment exceeds $200 million . Pascal insists that there are limits to the cost controls that can be imposed when dealing with certain high-powered filmmakers . ( During the making of Bad Boys II , Pascal tried to get director Michael Bay to hold down costs . he replied with a tart and dismissive fax . ) Those who worked with Lynton at AOL say that if Sony expects him to function as a hard-edged numbers guy , the company will be disappointed . Former colleagues describe Lynton in a way that might make one think of Stringer : a charming consensus seeker with a formidable Rolodex , a " consummate manager " of his own career . " His number-one skill is on the relationship side , " says Jerry Sokol , an AOL executive who served as Lynton 's number-two man . " He was impeccable at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The overarching question is whether , by hiring Lynton , Stringer has something in mind other than maintaining the status quo ( with a little cost cutting ) . His critics do n't think so ; they see the awkward setup at the studio as part of a strategy to diffuse authority and accountability . " Howard can say , " I 've hedged the chances of any one person screwing us up by not giving any one person too much power/ " says a veteran producer . OPTIMISTS HOPE that in hiring Lynton , Stringer is assembling a team that will help bring about that long-promised marriage of hardware and software . If so , he is moving in the most painful increments . Stringer has hewed to the party line that Sony was only too happy not to catch the consolidation fever that inflamed the rest of the media world . The company did n't squander money on failed Internet schemes , and it has no interest in owning something so old school as a television network , he says . Instead , he says , Sony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic devices to its homegrown entertainment . " We have what is going to take entertainment into this next century , " Stringer told a trade publication a few months ago . " In the next two years , it will become obvious . " Perhaps . But roll back the clock to March 2001 , whenFortune magazine was already raisingthe question of whether Sony was becoming " a fringe player in the entertainment world . " Chairman Nobuyuki Idei told the magazine then that Sony was moving forward " precisely at this time . " A high-ranking and frustrated Sony Pictures executive bemoans the fact that Sony still has n't figured it out . " The iPod is what Sony is supposed to be about , " he laments . " Sony invented the Walkman ! Sony owns a music company ! Yet the future is playing out of Steve Jobs 's company . How could they allow that to happen ? " Another top Sony Pictures executive who 's left the studio also has his doubts about what Stringer has in mind . " I do n't know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " It 's a lot of elegant talk , a lot of lovely , very British talk . The question is , is there a there there ? " The frustrated Sony Pictures executive says he still believes the company could return its entertainment assets to greatness . " It 's not over , " he says . " But it 'll only happen if Lynton and Howard are serious about it . " At the film studio , the lady on the logo keeps holding that torch . But much remains to be illuminated .
