How can I lose weight without getting asthma or giving up ? A Concerned Reader San Antonio , Texas Dear Concerned Reader : Well-controlled asthma usually does n't cause problems with exercise , explains asthma expert Dr. Jay Portnoy . " If you walk , exercise , or run and have problems with asthma , then that needs to be addressed , " he says . " Your healthcare provider should be able to help get the asthma under better control or you should see an asthma specialist to get an action plan .

Hannah Dickson , Tennessee Dear Hannah : Do you know what is causing your cough ? The answer to that question determines the right kind of treatment-if any-that is needed . Coughing clears your throat and other air passages of irritating particles . Dust , food , and even your own mucus can make you cough until your throat is clear .

Taking cough medicine could keep you from coughing up secretions that are clogging your airways . Only use cough medicine if your healthcare provider tells you to . // See you next issue !
