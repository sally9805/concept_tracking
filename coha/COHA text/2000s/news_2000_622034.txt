<p> Advertisements lurk everywhere  --  inside public rest-room stalls and on ATM screens . Even motorists are shown commercials while they 're pumping gas . <p> So why not turn each e-mail you send into a billboard ? <p> We 're not talking about the unsolicited spam that lands in your e-mail box , promising that you can " MAKEMONEYATHOME ! ! " We 're talking about that message you just fired off to your mom thanking her for the cookies she sent you . Using a new service offered by several Web startups , you could have ended that note with a banner ad suggesting that next time , mom tries Ghirardelli chocolate chips from Cooking.com . <p> These new companies , such as Denver 's Epidemic and New York 's Favemail , are banking that people will turn relationships into money-making opportunities by inserting ads  --  full-color images with links to Web pages  --  into e-mail messages . <p> Hundreds of online retailers , from OfficeMax.com to CDNow , have joined in . But the practice raises concerns about ethics and online etiquette , and begs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for sale ? <p> For some , however , maybe the more important question is : What 's my cut ? If you send that Cooking.com ad to your mom using Epidemic and she ends up buying the chocolate chips ( or anything else ) , you would get 10 percent of the sale price . <p> This scheme is a new twist on the concept of affiliate marketing , one of the cheapest and most popular ways for Internet companies to get new customers . In regular affiliate or associate programs , anyone with a Web page can make money by posting a banner ad linking to an online retailer , say Amazon.com , which says it has 400,000 associate sites . Then if any of the Web site 's visitors clicks on the ad and ends up buying something at Amazon.com , the page owner gets 5 percent of the purchase price . <p> These marketing companies are seeking to harness people 's relationships to get a foot in the door of your e-mail box , so to speak . As the world  --  especially the online world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little chance of being read without a friend 's name attached to them . <p> Forrester Research estimates that by 2004 , marketers will be sending consumers more than 200 billion e-mails a year . To be noticed in that ocean of advertising , e-mail marketers have been forced to get creative . <p> And since legitimate online marketers say they would never send e-mail without the recipient 's prior consent ( most e-tailers ask for and receive permission when you register at their Web site ) , using friends as spokespeople is one of the only acceptable ways a company can e-mail a potential customer . <p> Fledgling Internet retailers have already been trying hard to get customers to market to their acquaintances through " draft a friend " programs . For example , online grocer Webvan is offering a $15 coupon to any customer who recruits another customer . To make the process easier , Webvan even writes a polite form letter that the customer can forward to a friend . It starts out , " ( Your name ) has visited Webvan . . . and has asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can experience the benefits of Webvan yourself . " <p> It 's hard to tell whether these companies will be a hit with consumers because they are very new : Epidemic , Favemail and two similar companies called Tomeo and SuperSig were all founded in 1999 . But online advertisers like using " word of mail " promotions like this because it 's a cheap and effective way to acquire new customers . <p> " Everyone 's always known word of mouth is the most powerful form of advertising , " said Jim Nail , a senior analyst with Forrester Research . " The endorsement of someone you know and respect carries a lot of weight . " <p> And ideally , someone would send an ad or promotion for mountain climbing gear only to fellow mountaineers  --  giving the advertiser access to just the kind of person it is trying to reach . <p> By attaching their ads to e-mail , Epidemic and Favemail are also promoting their own companies . Their hope is that when someone gets an e-mail with an ad in it , they will like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ads in their own e-mail . <p> This kind of self-propagating promotion , called " viral marketing , " was very successful for Hotmail , the free e-mail provider that ends each message its users send with a single line of text : " Get Your Private , Free E-mail at http : //www.hotmail.com . " <p> In a way , Epidemic 's idea is just the grandchild of Hotmail , but a flamboyant grandchild that 's bound to cause much more commotion if it becomes popular . <p> " Draft a friend " programs are already controversial , and e-mail-borne advertising is bound to be even more divisive . Home furnishings chain Ikea withdrew such a program promoting the opening of its Emeryville location after just a few days because customers expressed concern that their friends would get stuck on Ikea 's mailing list . <p> A major concern is that giving people incentives to spread a commercial message by e-mail will lead to uninhibited spamming , ( sending unsolicited mail to people you do n't know ) . Sending an advertising-laden message to a list of 5,000 people is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> To prevent spamming , most of the sites limit the number of people one can recruit for credit . Webvan sets the limit at 20 . <p> Epidemic and its ilk insist that it 's more than a money-making ploy and that banner ads can serve as a vehicle for self-expression , allowing people to proclaim to the world that they truly loved reading " Angela 's Ashes , " which just happens to be on sale at Barnesandnoble.com . <p> Some of these sites also offer non-advertising images that can be incorporated into e-mail , so people can advertise their hobby or a favorite nonprofit organization . Tomeo , another e-mail banner ad company , is so sure that people will use its ads for self-expression that it does n't even pay its users commissions . Instead , the Israeli company lets users donate profits to charity or offer friends a rebate . <p> Douglas Rushkoff , author of " Coercion , " a book about how marketing has been woven into almost every aspect of life , said the new e-mail advertising , like " draft-a-friend " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their relationship with consumers . <p> These days , Rushkoff said , consumers are encouraged to act as if they work for a company and become personally involved in advocating brands . It 's a small step from wearing a big Nike swoosh on your shirt to including a Nike ad in each e-mail you send , Rushkoff said . <p> " That people are now willing to brand their correspondence means that they are willing to interact with that brand like they never have before , " Rushkoff said . <p> Enemies of e-mail abuse are divided on whether ad-bearing e-mails are acceptable or just a Trojan-horse brand of spam . <p> " Any friend of mine who sends me advertising to make money , as opposed to sending it out of a sincere belief that I was interested in the subject matter , would become a former friend quickly and find his mail blocked at my server , " said Cliff Sharp of Chicago , who helped found a group called the Forum for Responsible and Ethical E-mail . <p> Rod Crossland of Muncie , Ind. , another spam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " minor annoyance " and not as bad as ordinary spam . <p> But is any commission worth risking alienating one 's friends ? E-mail marketing expert Dan Janal likens the situation to encountering a friend who is always trying to recruit you to join a pyramid marketing scheme : " You want to avoid that guy ! " Janal laughed . " I think people who see their friends as customers are not going to have either . " <p> Virginia Shea , author of " Netiquette , " a guide to online manners , wrinkled her nose at the concept of turning one 's address book into a list of sales leads . <p> While she allowed that if one 's friends were into that kind of thing , they might grant you permission to advertise to them , Shea concluded , " Sending personal mail with advertising in it is just not good netiquette .
