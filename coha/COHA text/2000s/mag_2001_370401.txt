There are two ways to get a piece of the action at any of the big drug markets along the border : pay off  --  or kill off  --  anyone who stands in your way . But to gain exclusive control of the most lucrative gateway of all , says a veteran U.S. drug cop , a drug cartel has to pay and kill " beyond where any have ever gone before . " <P> And so few boundaries  --  national , moral , legal  --  constrain the border 's worst bad guys : Benjamin Arellano Felix , 49 , and his kid brother Ramon , 36 . The two baby-faced playboys head the Tijuana cartel , which sits atop Mexico 's $30 billion drug-trafficking underworld and may be the most powerful organization in the country of any kind . Each year they smuggle to the U.S. hundreds of tons of cocaine , plus marijuana , heroin and methamphetamine , ferried on ships , on planes and inside truckloads of legitimate merchandise . The Arellanos are thought to have hundreds of millions of dollars stashed away , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tune of some $75 million a year . <P> As for murder , it has evolved from the cartel 's last-ditch way to protect market share into its preferred means of communication .

According to testimony from former associates , Ramon often rises in the morning announcing , " I feel like killing somebody today , " then satisfies the urge in ways designed to build the legend , feed the fear .

Or suffocating a rival with a clear plastic bag over his head while a henchman named El Gordo ( the Fat Man ) bounces on his chest . But perhaps Ramon 's favorite ritual is carne asada  --  barbecue  --  executing entire families and tossing their corpses on a bed of flaming tires , as he and his goons celebrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a weakness , it may be their failure to see that even the border 's notorious criminal culture eventually has its limits . It 's true that since the Wild West days , when Billy the Kid wintered in El Paso and Juarez , border natives have often been a law unto themselves  --  a product of their historic , and justified , resentment of racist gringos to the north and haughty chilangos ( Mexico City residents ) to the south , who sneered at the border for being neither American nor Mexican enough . " That identity crisis and alienation grew into the violent face of the border , " says sociologist Jose Manuel Valenzuela of Tijuana 's Colegio de la Frontera Norte . Coupled with the region 's poverty , it spawned a subculture of toughs , often called pachucos and cholos.
