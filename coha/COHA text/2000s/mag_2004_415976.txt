LETTER OF THE MONTH SPRING BREAK , BROKEN I went to Snowshoe , West Virginia , this past spring break , expecting some awesome parties after reading your " 2003 Spring Party Guide " March/April 2003 . I was thinking that if you ranked them above the Canadians , it would have to be fun . I met some chicks ( 6 ' ' 2 " , 240-pound types named Olga ) and partied with people over 45 . It was one of the most boring trips I 've ever taken , and the snow sucked ! I was happy to see that you ranked Whistler #1 in 2004 , which is where they belong . Chris Marti Louisville , Kentucky You 've got spirit , Chris . Nobody can take that away from you . And because we 're sending you a pair of Scott 's PBR-inspired Beer Goggles ( for the Olgas of the world ) and a can of SPAM , you should be better provisioned for future spring breaks.Ed . MURDER , SHE WROTE Dear SKIING , I am a female inmate in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free subscription , as I am without funds . Any back issues would also be great ( up to five only , please ) . I used to visit Keystone regularly . Helen Gately Newport , Arkansas Dodging gapers at Keystone on a regular basis would drive us to a life of crime , too , Helen , but 35 years for Murder One ? We 're afraid we ca n't help.Ed . SUMMER STUNTS My friend and I are both amateur skiers from upstate New York . Our season is not very long , so this summer we built a 12-foot jump , covered it in carpet , and filled a flatbed truck with snow from the local ice rink so we could practice all summer . Never let the season die ! Joe Sabanos and Sean Dillon Saratoga , New York IN A PINCH Andrew McLean 's article , " A Clean Getaway " March/April 2004 , depicts a number of dangerous rappelling techniques . First , the " stone " being used as an anchor does n't meet any of the basic requirements for a good " bombproof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may make killer shoelaces , but offers no safety in a rappel that might become complicated , especially when using a bowline in a single anchor " lifeline . " Finally , suggesting the rappeler " wrap the rope around a body part " completes this serial progression toward a guaranteed painful , if not fatal , " getaway . " This article raises the question of how a one-page wannabe how-to piece serves the interests of the responsible , mainstream reader . Pierre A. Bustanoby Former Washington Mountain Rescue Association President Kenmore , Washington ANDREW McLEAN RESPONDS : For reliable simplicity in an emergency situation , nothing beats a length of rope in your backpack . In the mountains , an ounce of resourcefulness is worth many pounds of extraneous equipment . The anchor was a multi-ton rock firmly implanted in the earth , and a 7-mm cord with a bowline knot has a breaking strength of 1,800 pounds ( UIAGM guide Martin Volken carries 6-mm cord ) . The mighty bowline is second only in strength to the double bowline . And , according to Mountaineering : Freedom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " should be mastered by every rappeler in the event that carabiners and/or a harness are not available . " Which is the exact point of the article : making the most out of the least amount of gear . GARDEN STATE OF MIND As a longtime subscriber to your magazine , it seems to me that your writers and editors have become more juvenile and less polished as journalists . I stopped reading your article about tele-skiers from New Jersey Cold Front , February 2004 at the headline . The sentence " New Jersey Leads the Telemark Boom ... Swear-ta-frickin ' ' - gawd , " was tawdry and unnecessary . I know that you 're pandering to adolescent sensibilities , but could n't you be more clever ? John P. Casarino , M.D. New York , New York ARTICLE AUTHOR DOUG SCHNITZSPAHN , A NEW JERSEY NATIVE , RESPONDS : If you really want to hear tawdry and adolescent , take a ride on New Jersey Transit .
