In May 2004 , at the height of the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal , a senior political Republican Party operative was given the reassuring word that Vice President Dick Cheney had taken charge , with his usual directness . The operative learned that Cheney had telephoned Donald Rumsfeld with a simple message : No resignations . We 're going to hunker down and tough it out . // Cheney 's concern was not national security . This was a political call-a reminder that the White House would seize control of every crisis that could affect the re-election of George Bush . The Abu Ghraib revelations , if left unchecked , could provoke more public doubt about the wisdom of the war in Iraq , and about the sometimes brutal intelligence operations that were used to wage it . The White House and Pentagon also would have to work together to prevent Congress and the press from unraveling an incendiary secret - that undercover members of an intelligence unit that operated in secret in the name of every American had been at Abu Ghraib . The senior leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mess at Abu Ghraib , and , more importantly , of the fact that photographs and videotapes existed , and might someday reach the public . As we have seen , the military chain of command had ignored the possibility of higherup involvement and moved quickly to prosecute the military police who had committed the acts - " the kids at the end of the food chain , " as a former senior intelligence official put it : " We 've got some hillbilly kids out of control . " The perception persists that this was Rumsfeld 's war , and that it was his assertiveness and his toughness that sometimes led to the bombing of the wrong target or the arrest of innocents . But Cheney 's involvement in trying to conceal the import of Abu Ghraib was not unusual ; it was a sign of the teamwork at the top . George Bush talked about " smoking them out of their holes " and wanting them " dead or alive , " and Rumsfeld was the one who set up the mechanism to get it done . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat in public , as he did about Abu Ghraib , but the President and Vice President had been in it , and with him , all the way . Rumsfeld handled the dirty work and kept the secrets , but he and the two White House leaders were a team . // There is so much about this presidency that we do n't know , and may never learn . Some of the most important questions are not even being asked . How did they do it ? How did eight or nine neoconservatives who believed that a war in Iraq was the answer to international terrorism get their way ? How did they redirect the government and rearrange long-standing American priorities and policies with so much ease ? How did they overcome the bureaucracy , intimidate the press , mislead the Congress , and dominate the military ? Is our democracy that fragile ? I have tried , in this book , to describe some of the mechanisms used by the White House - the stovepiping of intelligence , the reliance on Ahmad Chalabi , the refusal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about military operations gone bad , and the inability - or unwillingness - of the President and his senior aides to distinguish between Muslims who supported terrorism and those who abhorred it . A complete understanding of these last few years will be a challenge for journalists , political scientists , and historians . // Many of the failings , however , were in plain sight . The Administration 's manipulation and distortion of the intelligence about Iraq 's ties to Al Qaeda and its national security threat to the United States was anything but a secret in Washington , as the pages of this book make clear . And yet the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee , after a year-long investigation , published a report , in July 2004 , stating that the critical mistakes were made not in the White House , but at the C.I.A. , whose analysts essentially missed the story . There was an astonishing postscript that told much about the disarray in Washington . Three Democrats , John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia , the vice chairman of the committee , Carl Levin of Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Services Committee , and Richard Durbin of Illinois , signed a separate statement disavowing the report 's central findings . " Regrettably , the report paints an incomplete picture of what occurred during this period of time , " they wrote , noting that the " central issue " of how intelligence was misused by the Administration and the pre-war role of Ahmad Chalabi would be included in a second report-one that was not to be made public until after the presidential election . " As a result , " they wrote , " the Committee 's phase one report fails to fully explain the environment of intense pressure in which Intelligence Community officials were asked to render judgments on matters relating to Iraq , when policy officials had already forcefully stated their own conclusions in public . " // And yet , Rockefeller , Levin , and Durbin put their names on the report , helping to make it appear unanimous and bipartisan . There are , once again , unanswered questions . Why did n't the Democrats take a stronger stand ? How much influence did the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't the press go beyond the immediate facts ? The inner workings of the committee were in many ways a more important story than its findings . // ( Continues ... ) //
