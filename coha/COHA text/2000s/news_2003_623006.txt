<p> Comcast Corp . Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts faces a daunting task . <p> Just three months after taking control of AT &T; Broadband , the Bay Area 's largest cable operator , Roberts concedes it wo n't be easy to shake the system 's reputation for lousy service and limited offerings , cultivated through the years by earlier owners . <p> " We want to fix it , " said Roberts , a Philadelphia cable scion . But Roberts cautioned : " We are not going to fix it overnight . This is a battleship that is going to turn slowly . " <p> Roberts , in town last week with other Bay Area executives to tout the new ownership , made plenty of promises in an hourlong interview with The Chronicle . <p> Topping the list : Roberts vowed to spend more than $400 million to finish upgrading nearly all its cable lines in the Bay Area by the end of 2004 to offer more channels and high-speed Internet service in more neighborhoods . ( Less than half of area lines are now upgraded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top Comcast executives held a pep rally for 3,500 employees on the aircraft carrier Hornet in Alameda . AT &T; Broadband officially adopted the Comcast name last Friday with a flurry of ads featuring Lance Armstrong . <p> But local customers and government officials reacted with some skepticism to all the hoopla . AT &T; Broadband , after all , made similar promises when it took over TCI in 1999 , only to wind up disappointing locals . <p> " We 're going to be watching Comcast very closely , " Oakland City Councilwoman Jane Brunner said . Oakland is in the midst of negotiating Comcast 's franchise agreement with the city , and Brunner said she has learned the importance of extracting promises in writing  --  with penalties if cable companies miss the targets . <p> Meanwhile , city officials in San Francisco are not happy about the slow pace of the upgrading of the city 's cable system  --  only a quarter of which has been completed . When AT &T; Broadband acquired TCI , it promised to finish the upgrading work by September 2003 . <p> Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upgrading will be completed by the end of 2004 , more than a year behind schedule . <p> " We are terribly disappointed , " said Denise Brady , deputy director of San Francisco 's Department of Telecommunications and Information Services . <p> For some customers , the promises come too late . Hundreds of thousands of Bay Area residents have switched to satellite TV in the past few years , partly out of frustration with AT &T; Broadband and its predecessors . <p> To talk about the changes and competition from satellite , a group of Chronicle editors and writers met last week with Roberts , company founder and Chairman Ralph Roberts ( Brian 's father ) , Comcast Cable Communications President Stephen Burke and Joseph Fischer , who oversees Comcast 's operations in California . <p> The Chronicle : Where do you plan to start making changes ? <p> Brian Roberts : We took 150 ( Comcast ) executives and moved them around the country . That is a lot of people to move . 2003 is not a transitional year . 2003 is hit the ground running . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused . <p> Burke : This is my fourth trip to the Bay Area . AT &T; was running it as one market . We looked at it and said , " My gosh , this is 1.6 million subscribers  --  and there is a difference between Oakland and Napa . " This is not one market , so we are dividing the business into five areas . Each of those will have local management . And we will bring all customer calls for video back this year . AT &T; was moving calls out of state . <p> B. Roberts : Last year , ( AT &T; Broadband ) actually lost customers on a net basis . Alarm bells were ringing . <p> Ralph Roberts : This system has changed hands 18 times . <p> B. Roberts : It has probably had more transitions than any other market in the country . It is a market that should be fully rebuilt ( and ) that should have high-definition video , Internet , all those things . <p> If you look at Philadelphia as an example , Philadelphia is 100 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a brand-new version of video on demand , so you can stop and fast forward . The market that should be first is Silicon Valley and the Bay Area , not Philadelphia . <p> Job No. 1 is to get this going . This is going to take $400 million in new infrastructure . <p> The Chronicle : Is that $400 million you have to get back from customers ? <p> B. Roberts : This is total risk capital . If people do n't buy cable modems ( and other products ) , nobody gives us the $400 million back . . . . The first benefit is to give people more TV channels . Once you make that step , there are other steps . Like HDTV , interactive television if we ever figure that out , cable telephony . <p> The Chronicle : Can you talk about what you are going to do on each of those fronts ? <p> Joe Fischer : On the outside , we will probably have video on demand in the Bay Area in areas that are upgraded within six months . Likewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue with switched telephony that exists here now . There are trials in Detroit and Philadelphia on IP telephony , which is a different product we will switch over to . As we upgrade neighborhoods , you 'll see us ( add more ) digital channels . And we 'll launch the high-speed data immediately in those neighborhoods . <p> The Chronicle : You raised cable TV rates 6.5 percent in January . <p> B. Roberts : It was really in the works ( before we bought AT &T; Broadband ) . <p> The Chronicle : What about the future ? <p> B. Roberts : We can invent new products . Those products are optional , so that has taken pressure off of rates . <p> One of the reasons rates go up is programming . Programming costs have been going up double-digits . Cable has been going up on average around 5 percent a year . Both of those are higher than inflation . But it would have been higher without the introduction of cable modems . <p> What we do n't have today is the option to say ESPN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic cable , and our contracts wo n't let us pick and choose . So as we go forward , we are trying to make every new product optional . <p> By the way , Dish Network and DirecTV both raised their rates by $2 per month . <p> The Chronicle : Comcast has a reputation for charging more than AT &T; Broadband . And you 've promised Wall Street you 'll double the profit margins for AT &T; Broadband business . Is part of your strategy to raise rates ? <p> B. Roberts : It 's no secret that AT &T's; average margin was around 20 percent and Comcast 's is around 40 percent . But their revenue is not that different . As a matter of fact , it is slightly higher because of ( the revenue from cable telephone service ) . It is just a matter of focusing and running a tight ship . <p> The Chronicle : Are you going to tinker with the channel lineups ? <p> B. Roberts : Guys in Philadelphia wo n't make that decision . And even in the Bay Area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily be what happens in another . <p> Fischer : We have no plans to drop anything . Obviously , if we have no plans to drop anything , it 's difficult to shoehorn anything in . But we are still looking at it . <p> The Chronicle : Can you talk about your decision to charge cable modem customers $14 more per month if they do n't also subscribe to cable TV ? <p> B. Roberts : We went to the same pricing for cable modem that we have everywhere . There is a bundle . Most DSL providers do the same thing . There is an efficiency of having more than one product coming into your house . <p> The Chronicle : Do you risk losing customers to DSL ? <p> B. Roberts : That is always a risk . But I believe we added cable modem customers in November , December and January at a very good rate in every market . It is a very hot product . <p> The Chronicle : What do you think of SBC Communications ' interest in buying DirecTV and bundling telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good luck . <p> The Chronicle : How would you rate the Bay Area cable system compared with other areas ' ? <p> B. Roberts : I think there is significant room for improvement . <p> A big part of our strategy is to get to local . You call customer service in San Francisco , there is a good chance now that call is being answered in Canada . It should be answered in San Francisco . The way you win is by giving better service . <p> In the Bay Area , no one knows anything about Comcast . We have a blank slate of paper . We have an opportunity to change people 's perceptions of their cable company for the first time . <p> E-mail Todd Wallack at **25;8104;TOOLONG
