You 've been bruised and confused . There 's nowhere to run , and you 're in pain , without anyone . You 've got a lot to learn ; do you know where you can turn ? Mariah Carey  --  fragile workaholic , recovering star of Glitter , multimillion-dollar record-company layoff and author of wounded banalities like those above  --  would like you to turn to her . <P> But perhaps neediness is n't your thing . Maybe you 're the sparring type , and you live your life the way you feel ; no matter what , you keep it real . Then Whitney Houston  --  reedy substance abuser , self-proclaimed child of God , spouse of one of the world 's most consistent recreational-drug suspects , and singer of tough platitudes  --  awaits your ear . <P> It 's a problem when a singer 's personal life is more interesting than her music . The lives of America 's two grandest pop divas have become as scandalously compelling as an Aaron Spelling script . But their songs , as demonstrated above , have not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decidedly different approaches to the pop comeback ; one is penitent , the other defiant . Both are letdowns . <P> Carey 's fall from the charts was the more tragically spectacular . While promoting Glitter , her vanity movie and album , she did a woozy striptease on MTV , posted a series of bizarre ramblings on her website and even flirted with Eminem . After she was hospitalized for exhaustion and Glitter flopped in a Waterworld-meets  --  Chris Gaines kind of way , Carey 's record label paid her $28 million not to record with it again . This is pretty humiliating stuff , and Charmbracelet is not above begging for sympathy . Carey opens with Through the Rain , a somber ballad that reduces her formidable voice to a tentative little quaver . " I can make it through the rain , I can stand up once again , " she sings . Never mind that Barry Manilow used these approximate lyrics in 1980 's I Made It Through the Rain ; Carey herself turned in almost the exact same vocal performance on 1993 's Hero . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allusions to her recent problems while musically cannibalizing her back catalog . There are a few moments when she reveals enough to make the formula interesting , as on the playful Clown , a mid-tempo revenge song that responds to Eminem 's sexual innuendo with the lines , " You should 've never intimated we were lovers/When you know very well we never even touched each other . " But mostly Charmbracelet feels like a hedge . There are the guest rappers ( Jay-Z , Cam'ron ) of Carey 's late ' 90s hits , the chipper ballads of her multiplatinum middle period and even the glass-shattering dolphin shrieks of her early days . But there 's a surprising lack of hummable hooks , and all the nostalgia drains Charmbracelet of exuberance , the one thing no pop album can live without .
