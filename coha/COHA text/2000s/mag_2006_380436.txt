He 's still beaming over the early-morning revelation . Terrence Howard , 36 , woke up last Tuesday to find that he had been nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for Hustle &; Flow and that another film in which he co-starred , Crash , was up for Best Picture . He spoke to TIME 's Desa Philadelphia about portraying a pimp so convincingly and why his success in Hollywood has been bittersweet . <P> YOU ARE BEING CALLED AN OVERNIGHT SUCCESS , BUT YOU 'VE BEEN WORKING STEADILY FOR A LONG TIME . That 's just the nature of this business . There are so many talented people here , and there are so many different machineries working for the other talents . It 's a combination of luck and preparation in order for all this to happen . You know how many brilliant performances there were this year ? But it 's almost like what they say in Paulo Coelho 's The Alchemist , " When you seek out your own personal legend , the universe conspires . " <P> SO YOU DO N'T BUY ANY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOES N'T MEAN MUCH IN TERMS OF FUTURE SUCCESS ? No . You 've got to think that for the rest of my career , the title of Academy Award nominee  --  and possibly winner  --  will always be there . That 's a hell of a calling card . It 's like when a doctor receives his degree . There 's always that Dr. in front of his name . <P> WHAT KIND OF OFFERS HAVE YOU BEEN GETTING SINCE THESE MOVIES CAME OUT ? Mostly more challenging roles . I used to tell executives and producers years ago , " When you find a character that you need but you just can not find the right person to pull him off  --  if there is a dichotomy about him , some strange anomaly  --  that 's when I want you to call me . " I want to be the condensation on the glass . I want to be that phenomenon that takes place between hot and cold . <P> AND IT NOW FEELS AS THOUGH YOU 'LL GET THOSE KINDS OF ROLES ? Yes . They are already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about creating . You 've got to look at what George Clooney has done . Yeah , you can go and buy a car , rent a car or lease one . But there is nothing like designing your own vehicle . YOU PREPARED FOR YOUR OSCAR-NOMINATED ROLE IN HUSTLE &; FLOW BY HANGING OUT WITH REAL-LIFE PIMPS . WHAT WERE THEY LIKE ? Like you and me . People who had made bad choices in their lives , and sometimes the bad choices can follow you for a long way . <P> IN CRASH , YOU FACE DISCRIMINATION AS A YUPPIE TV DIRECTOR , WHICH IS WORLDS AWAY FROM THE PIMP YOU PLAYED . DID THAT MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT RACE IN HOLLYWOOD ? We 're all caught up under this umbrella of political correctness , which I truly believe is a front for bigotry because we do n't learn about each other . Until people start being truly honest  --  that 's when we 'll be able to bring an end to the problems we see associated with race in Hollywood and the rest of the world . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FRONT ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU 'VE BEEN SO BUSY THIS YEAR THAT IT HAS AFFECTED YOUR PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS . DOES THAT MAKE YOUR SUCCESS BITTERSWEET ? It stands as a warning sign to anyone who really wants to be successful in this business . There are many sacrifices you have to make . You have to have your family circle well balanced . You have to keep your family with you because there are so many changes that take place on a day-to-day basis that when you get back home after being gone for three months , you are not the same person and neither is she .
