Shelter and Beyond 1909-1931 On April 13 , 1909 , Eudora Alice Welty was born to Christian Webb and Chestina Andrews Welty . The young couple had been living in Jackson , Mississippi , since their marriage five years earlier . He had come from Ohio , she from West Virginia ; they had met when Chris , as he was known , worked one summer at a logging camp near her home . Courtship had led to love , and they had chosen to begin their married life in Mississippi 's rapidly growing capital city ; Jackson 's population had been slightly less than eight thousand in 1900 , but by 1910 it would have more than tripled . In this booming town , the Weltys prospered : In 1906 Chris joined the newly established Lamar Life Insurance Company as its cashier , becoming the assistant secretary by year 's end , and in 1908 the couple built their first house , on North Congress Street . Though Chestina , or Chessie as her husband called her , kept a cow and chickens in the backyard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the downtown theaters , department stores , and grocers ; within two blocks of the state capitol ; and within three blocks of Galloway Methodist Church , to which they belonged . They also lived across the street from a grammar school and within sight of a cemetery . Their first child , a son born in 1906 , lay in that cemetery , having died at the age of fifteen months . This loss had been devastating , but now the birth of a daughter was cause for both great rejoicing and great resolve . Chris and Chessie would be protective parents indeed . An ardent amateur photographer as well as an excited new father , Chris constantly snapped pictures of his daughter-as a babe in her mother'sarms ; in a specially ordered bonnet ; on her first Christmas ; on a trip to West Virginia and Ohio the summer after her birth ; at home , attempting her first steps ; with a miniature baby carriage and doll ; in the yard with her mother 's chickens ; in a fine dress for her three-year-old birthday party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ album and wrote captions for the photos ; below a picture of Chris and Eudora she wrote " a proud Daddy , " and below one of herself with the baby , she added " and mother too . " From the first , Eudora Welty was reared in an atmosphere of abundant parental love.1 She was also reared in a book-filled environment . By the time she was two or three years old , Eudora knew , as she wrote in her autobiography , that " any room in our house , at any time of day , was there to read in , or to be read to . My mother read to me . She 'd read to me in the big bedroom in the mornings , when we were in her rocker together , which ticked in rhythm as we rocked , as though we had a cricket accompanying the story . She 'd read to me in the diningroom on winter afternoons in front of the coal fire , with our cuckoo clock ending the story with ' Cuckoo , ' and at night when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given her no peace . Sometimes she read to me in the kitchen while she sat churning , and the churning sobbed along with any story . " 2 From the start , Eudora loved the written word , and her keen ear for language and inflection began to develop long before she could read for herself . After she became a reader on her own , Eudora followed a pattern set by her mother and would often have several books underway , one for each of the various rooms in her house . Having spent three years as an only child , Eudora might have felt displaced when her brothers , Edward Jefferson Welty and Walter Andrews Welty , were born in 1912 and 1915 . But though Chris took a photo of Eudora pouting behind Chessie and the newly arrived Edward , Chessie 's photo caption noted that her daughter was " not as sorry as she looks . " Indeed , she was not . She and Edward proved kindred spirts from the start : " I ca n't think I had much of a sense of humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brother Edward came along after I was three , we both became comics , making each other laugh . We set each other off , as we did for life , from the minute he learned to talk . A sense of the absurd was communicated between us probably before that . " Though Walter even as an infant proved more serious than his older siblings , his sister doted on him and sought to entertain him : Once , she reported , " I snatched up his baby bathtub and got behind it and danced for him , to hear him really crow . On the pink bottom of his tub I 'd drawn a face with crayons , and all he could see of anybody 's being there was my legs prancing under it . " And of course Eudora 's parents were proud of the new additions to their family . When the city of Jackson held a baby parade in 1916 , the Jackson Clarion-Ledger reported that Christian Welty participated with **25;0;TOOLONG Edward , who was on a velocipede-or tricycle , as we know it today-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriage decorated with roses.3 The closeness of family life was something Eudora treasured . In One Writer 's Beginnings , she recalled hearing her parents perform their own version of Franz Lehar 's " The Merry Widow Waltz " as she buttoned her shoes in the morning : " They would begin whistling back and forth to each other up and down the stairwell . My father would whistle his phrase , my mother would try to whistle , then hum hers back . It was their duet . I drew my buttonhook in and out and listened to it-I knew it was ' The Merry Widow . ' The difference was , their song almost floated with laughter : how different from the record , which growled from the beginning , as if the Victrola were only slowly being wound up . " And she loved to lie in bed listening to her parents across the room talk or read to each other : " I do n't remember that any secrets were revealed to me , nor do I remember any avid curiosity on my part to learn something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what to listen for . But I was present in the room with the chief secret there was-the two of them , father and mother , sitting there as one . " 4 The strength of her parents ' union betokened a larger union of parents and children . Family activities for the Weltys were constant . They went for early-morning swims , they attended lectures , concerts , and plays brought by the Circuit Chautauqua to Poindexter Park , they looked at the stars through Chris 's telescope , they flew homemade kites in pastures outside of town , they consulted the dictionary to determine the meaning of words that had baffled one of them during dinner conversation , and they journeyed to Ohio and West Virginia to visit grandparents , uncles , and cousins . Each summer mother and children also journeyed about fifteen miles from Jackson and spent several weeks trying to escape the city heat . Their destination waas a small resort called Hubbard 's Wells , a place where healthful waters could be drunk , where paper lanterns hung from the trees , and where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris joined his family on weekends . Back home in Jackson , the Welty children were part of a lively neighborhood . They joined other children in riding velocipedes , and eventually , bicycles ( Eudora was proud to own a " Princess " bicycle ) . With friends they played hopscotch and jacks , jumped rope , and roller-skated . At twilight they pulled their " choo-choo boats " made from shoe boxes , with holes cut out in the shape of the moon and stars and with lighted candles inside . And they shared rides in pony carts . Eudora and her friends loved strolling to the movies . Setting out in the early summer afternoon on foot , by way of Smith Park to Capitol Street and down it , passing the Pythian Castle with its hot stone breath , through the one spot of shade beneath Mrs. Black 's awning , crossing Town Creek-then visible and uncontained-we went carrying parasols over our heads and little crocheted bags over our wrists containing the ten or fifteen cents for the ticket ( with a nickel or dime further for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had our choice-the Majestic or the Istrione . At the Majestic we could sit in a box-always empty , because airless as a bureau drawer ; at the Istrione , which was said to occupy the site of an old livery stable , we might see Alice Brady in " Drums of Jeopardy " and at the same time have a rat run over our feet . As far as I recall , there was no movie we were not allowed to see , until we got old enough not to see " The Shiek . " The little girls , Eudora also recalled , spent entire summer days making " batteries " of paper dolls and having them perform " exciting scenes we thought up . " 5 The future story writer was at an early age actively engaging her imagination . Other activities were for children and adults alike . In Smith Park , neighborhood families picnicked or attended evening band concerts together . And parents , Chris and Chessie included , often organized more far-flung expeditions for the children , traveling to the clay banks on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a family whom Chessie saw as disreputable established residence on Congress Street , she sought to deny her children their company , but her daughter was eager to transcend class boundaries . In an early and never-published novella , Courtney , a character clearly based upon Eudora , longs to play with the Hockin children , whose family has rented an apartment across the street . Her mother discourages this practice : " I ca n't understand how those Hockins could have gotten into this neighborhood . They are as common as they can be . Courtney , I would rather you did n't play with them so much , dear . " The Hockins in this story are deemed objectionable not because of lineage or poverty but because they are loud , indecorous , impolite , even unbathed . The mother in Eudora 's 1942 story " The Winds " makes class distinctions based on similar criteria , even as her daughter Josie looks up to the disreputable Cornella . Such aspects of this story , Eudora told her agent Diarmuid Russell , " were little fragments out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first story I 've tried directly attempting to remember exact real sensations.
