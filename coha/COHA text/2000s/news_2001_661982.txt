In the most devastating terrorist onslaught ever waged against the United States , knife-wielding hijackers crashed two airliners into the World Trade Center on Tuesday , toppling its twin 110-story towers . The deadly calamity was witnessed on televisions across the world as another plane slammed into the Pentagon , and a fourth crashed outside Pittsburgh . <p> " Today , our nation saw evil , " President Bush said in an address to the nation Tuesday night . He said thousands of lives were " suddenly ended by evil , despicable acts of terror . " <p> Said Adm . Robert J. Natter , commander of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet : " We have been attacked like we have n't since Pearl Harbor . " <p> Establishing the death toll could take weeks . The four airliners alone had 266 people aboard and there were no known survivors . Arlington County , Va. , fire chief said deaths at the Pentagon ranged between 100 and 800 . <p> In addition , a union official said he feared 300 firefighters who first reached the scene had died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked - and dozens of police officers were missing . <p> " The number of casualties will be more than most of us can bear , " a visibly distraught Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said . <p> Police sources said some people trapped in the twin towers managed to call authorities or family members and that some trapped police officers made radio contact . In one of the calls , which took place in the afternoon , a businessman phoned his family to say he was trapped with policemen , whom he named , the source said . <p> Firefighter Rudy Weindler spent nearly 12 hours trying to find survivors and only found four - a pregnant woman sitting on a curb and three others in the rubble of a building in the trade center complex . <p> " I lost count of all the dead people I saw , " Weindler said . " It is absolutely worse than you could ever imagine . " <p> No one took responsibility for the attacks that rocked the seats of finance and government . But federal authorities identified Osama bin Laden , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the prime suspect . <p> Aided by an intercept of communications between his supporters and harrowing cell phone calls from at least one flight attendant and two passengers aboard the jetliners before they crashed , U.S. officials began assembling a case linking bin Laden to the devastation . <p> U.S. intelligence intercepted communications between bin Laden supporters discussing the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon , according to Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch , the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee . <p> The people aboard planes who managed to make cell phone calls each described similar circumstances : They indicated the hijackers were armed with knives , in some cases stabbing flight attendants . The hijackers then took control of the planes . <p> All of the planes were bound for California and thus loaded with fuel . <p> The Boston Herald , quoting a source it did not identify , reported that authorities had seized a car at Logan airport that contained Arabic-language flight training manuals . The source said five Arab men had been identified as suspects , including a trained pilot . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portland , Maine , the Herald said . <p> The luggage of one of the men who flew to the airport Tuesday did n't make his scheduled connection . The Boston Globe reported the luggage contained a copy of the Koran , an instructional video on flying commercial airliners and a fuel consumption calculator . <p> The FBI refused to comment on the reports . <p> The airport was evacuated and shut down until further notice . <p> At the World Trade Center , the dead and the doomed plummeted from the skyscrapers , among them a man and woman holding hands . <p> Shortly after 7 p.m. , crews began heading into ground zero of the attack to search for survivors and recover bodies . All that remained of the twin towers by then was a pile of rubble and twisted steel that stood five stories high , leaving a huge gap in the New York City skyline . <p> " Freedom itself was attacked this morning and I assure you freedom will be defended , " said Bush , who was in Florida at the time of the catastrophe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Strategic Air Command bunker in Nebraska before leaving for Washington . <p> " Make no mistake , " he said . " The United States will hunt down and pursue those responsible for these cowardly actions . " <p> More than nine hours after the U.S. attacks began , explosions could be heard north of the Afghan capital of Kabul , but American officials said the United States was not responsible . <p> " It is n't us . I do n't know who 's doing it , " Pentagon spokesman Craig Quigley said . <p> Officials across the world condemned the attacks but in the West Bank city of Nablus , thousands of Palestinians celebrated , chanting " God is Great " and handing out candy . The United States has become increasingly unpopular in the Mideast in the past year of Israeli-Palestinian fighting , with Washington widely seen as siding with Israel against the Arab world . <p> At the Pentagon , the symbol and command center for the nation 's military force , one side of the building collapsed as smoke billowed over the Potomac River . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred shortly before 8:45 a.m . EDT . A burning , 47-story part of the trade center complex , long since evacuated , collapsed in flames just before nightfall . <p> Emergency Medical Service worker Louis Garcia said initial reports indicated that bodies were buried beneath the two feet of soot on streets around the trade center . <p> " A lot of the vehicles are running over bodies because they are all over the place , " he said . <p> Said National Guard member Angelo Otchy of Maplewood , N.J. , " I must have come across body parts by the thousands . I came across a lady , she did n't remember her name . Her face was covered in blood . " <p> For the first time , the nation 's aviation system was completely shut down as officials considered the frightening flaws that had been exposed in security procedures . Financial markets were closed , too . <p> Top leaders of Congress were led to an undisclosed location , as were key officials of the Bush administration . Guards armed with automatic weapons patrolled the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital city . National Guard troops appeared on some street corners in the nation 's capital . <p> Evacuations were ordered at the tallest skyscrapers in several cities , and high-profile tourist attractions closed - Walt Disney World , Mount Rushmore , Seattle 's Space Needle , the Gateway Arch in St. Louis . <p> The Federal Reserve , seeking to provide assurances that the nation 's banking system would be protected , said it would provide additional money to banks if needed . <p> In Afghanistan , where bin Laden has been given asylum , the nation 's hardline Taliban rulers rejected suggestions he was responsible . <p> Bin Laden came to prominence fighting alongside the U.S.-backed Afghan mujahedeen - holy warriors - in their war against Soviet troops in the 1980s . But former followers say he turned against the United States during the 1991 Gulf War , seething at the deployment of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War campaign to oust Iraq from Kuwait . He has repeatedly called on Muslims worldwide to join in a jihad , or holy war , against the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al-Arabi newspaper , said he received a warning from Islamic fundamentalists close to bin Laden , but had not taken the threat seriously . " They said it would be a huge and unprecedented attack , but they did not specify , " Atwan said in a telephone interview in London . <p> Eight years ago , the World Trade Center was a terrorist target when a truck bomb killed six people and wounded about 1,000 others . Just the death toll on the planes alone could surpass the 168 people killed in the 1995 bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City . <p> This is how Tuesday 's mayhem unfolded : <p> At about 8:45 a.m. , a hijacked airliner crashed into the north tower of the trade center , the 25-year-old , glass-and-steel complex that was once the world 's tallest . <p> Clyde Ebanks , an insurance company vice president , was at a meeting on the 103rd floor of the south tower when his boss said , " Look at that ! " He turned to see a plane slam into the other tower . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter Dicerbo , a bank employee on the 47th floor . " It knocked me on the floor . It sounded like a big roar , then the building started swaying . That 's what really scared me . " <p> The enormity of the disaster was just sinking in when 18 minutes later , the south tower also was hit by a plane . <p> " All this stuff started falling and all this smoke was coming through . People were screaming , falling , and jumping out of the windows , " said Jennifer Brickhouse , 34 , from Union , N.J. <p> The chaos was just beginning . Workers stumbled down scores of flights , their clothing torn and their lungs filled with smoke and dust . <p> John Axisa said he ran outside and watched people jump out of the first building ; then there was a second explosion , and he felt the heat on the back of his neck . <p> Donald Burns , 34 , was being evacuated from the 82nd floor when he saw four people in the stairwell . " I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch them . The fire had melted their skin . Their clothes were tattered , " he said . <p> Worse was to come . At 9:50 , one tower collapsed , sending debris and dust cascading to the ground . At 10:30 , the other tower crumbled . <p> Glass doors shattered , police and firefighters ushered people into subway stations and buildings . The air was black , from the pavement to the sky . The dust and ash were inches deep along the streets . <p> Bridges and tunnels were closed to all but pedestrians . Subways were shut down for much of the day ; many commuter trains were not running . <p> Meanwhile , at about 9:30 a.m. , an airliner hit the Pentagon - the five-sided headquarters of the American military . " There was screaming and pandemonium , " said Terry Yonkers , an Air Force civilian employee at work inside the building . <p> The military boosted security across the country to the highest levels , sending Navy ships to New York and Washington to assist with air defense and medical needs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airlines Flight 93 , a Boeing 757 jetliner en route from Newark , N.J. , to San Francisco , crashed about 80 miles southeast of Pittsburgh . <p> Airline officials said the other three planes that crashed were American Airlines Flight 11 , a Boeing 767 from Boston to Los Angeles , apparently the first to hit the trade center ; United Airlines Flight 175 , also a Boeing 767 from Boston to Los Angeles , which an eyewitness said was the second to hit the skyscrapers ; and American Airlines Flight 77 , a Boeing 757 en route from Washington-Dulles to Los Angeles that hit the Pentagon . <p> " We 're at war , " said Gaillard Pinckney , an employee at the Housing and Urban Development office in Columbia , S.C . " We just do n't know with who . " <p> Giuliani said it was believed the aftereffects of the plane crashes eventually brought the buildings down , not planted explosive devices . <p> Hyman Brown , a University of Colorado civil engineering professor and the construction manager for the World Trade Center , speculated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel supports . <p> " This building would have stood had a plane or a force caused by a plane smashed into it , " he said . " But steel melts , and 24,000 gallons of aviation fluid melted the steel . Nothing is designed or will be designed to withstand that fire . " <p> At mid-afternoon , Giuliani said 1,500 " walking wounded " had been shipped to Liberty State Park in New Jersey by ferry and tugboat , and 750 others were taken to New York City hospitals , among them 150 in critical condition . <p> Well into the night , a steady stream of boats continued to arrive in the park . " Every 10 minutes another boat with 100 to 150 people on it pulls up , " said Mayor Glenn Cunningham . " I have a feeling this is going to go on for several days . " <p> Felix Novelli , who lives in Southampton , N.Y. , was in Nashville with his wife for a World War II reunion . He was trying to fly home to New York when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . No mercy , " he said . " This is Dec. 7th happening all over again . We have to come together like ' 41 , go after them . " <p> The attack on Pearl Harbor claimed the lives of 2,390 Americans , most of them servicemen .
