Dave Matthews Band Big Whiskey &; the GrooGrux King 3 stars CRITIC 'S CHOICE POP-ROCK The first and last thing you hear on the new Dave Matthews Band album is the saxophone of LeRoi Moore , a founding member of the group who died last August . His presence is still strongly felt on the CD : The GrooGrux King part of the title nods to Moore , and he plays on a good share of tracks , including the haunting " Lying in the Hands of God , " which takes on more resonance than could have ever been intended . Spiritual and spirited , the disc serves as an emotionally and musically rich send-off to that great shed in the sky . DOWNLOAD THIS : " Funny the Way It Is , " the pensive , Sting-esque single Vanessa Williams The Real Thing 2 stars JAZZ-POP Long before Ugly Betty , Vanessa Williams was a Grammy-nominated R &B-pop; singer . This disc finds her sashaying to a jazz and Latin groove . It 's a typically classy affair but could use a bit of Wilhelmina 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a Babyface bossa Paolo Nutini Sunny Side Up 3 stars ALT-POP While the U.K. 's retro-soul movement has made stateside successes out of the ladies -- from Amy Winehouse and Duffy to Adele and Estelle -- Paolo Nutini 's 2007 debut , These Streets , was sorely underappreciated on these shores . This follow-up does n't match the pop hooks of its predecessor , which simply had better songs , but it finds the sandpapery-voiced Scot stretching out stylistically , showing that , at 22 , he 's still growing as an artist . Whether it 's Dixieland ( " 10/10 " ) , ragtime ( " Pencil Full of Lead " ) , Stax soul ( " Coming Up Easy ) or traditional Celtic sounds ( " Chamber Music " ) , he continues to show a flair for music from way before his time .

His self-titled debut drops June 30 . BOX QUICK CUTS MARILYN MANSON The High End of Low If you thought that MM might have finally learned to let a smile be his umbrella , think again . He 's still rock 's prince of darkness , but even he struggles to sustain high-quality gloom over 72-plus minutes . 2 stars BUSTA RHYMES Back on My B.S. One of hip-hop 's real characters , Busta always brings a supersize personality to his albums . To go along with that , he 's got some hot beats and some hot guest stars , like T.I. , T-Pain and Lil Wayne . 3 stars PARACHUTE Losing Sleep Everything glides by smoothly ( if safely ) on this CW-friendly quintet 's pop-rock debut , which hit No. 1 on the iTunes chart . Some of these songs just may even cause Maroon 5 and Jonas Brothers to lose a few winks . 2 stars RYAN BINGHAM Roadhouse Sun This Texas troubadour can bring to mind a gravelly-voiced version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan ( see " Dylan 's Hard Rain " ) along this rootsy road . 3 stars BOX CATCHING UP WITH ... TEENA MARIE * The blue-eyed soul pioneer , 53 , celebrates 30 years in the biz with Congo Square , out June 9 . ON HER CD 'S TITLE Congo Square is a place in New Orleans where slaves were allowed to go dance and sing on Sundays . I went to New Orleans to write and record this album , and then I found out my family is from there . ON BREAKING COLOR BARRIERS I was n't trying to be a pioneer , just wanted to sing what was in my soul . I 'm sure it 's easier now for all races to make the music they want . ON THE NEW BLUE-EYED SOUL DIVAS I think Amy Winehouse writes some amazing lyrics , and she actually credits me as an influence in her Frank liner notes . And Adele 's " Chasing Pavements " is an incredible piece . ON LATE MENTOR RICK JAMES I miss him all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , used to steal from each other 's closets . Now I have to not just represent myself but him .
