<p> I am a statistic . I am one of millions on the rolls of student debt . Every month I write a check for $650 to Sallie Mae . I simply abbreviate the entry in my checkbook as S-M . It hurts . <p> At 47 , 16 years out of grad school , I still owe $9,000 on my graduate school loans . Earning $28,000 as an assistant professor , I could not afford to pay them at first , so I took the maximum four years of forbearance and only began chipping away at them in 1994 . Now , as a single father , I also owe PLUS loans for my daughter 's undergraduate education , combining for a total of $34,000 , which I will be paying over the next 11 years . <p> Besides that , my daughter , who graduated in 2002 , owes $24,000 for a Barnard B.A. And that is relatively fortunate , because Barnard uses a need-based formula for financial aid , so she essentially received a full-tuition scholarship . Working in film in New York for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years forbearance and soon must begin paying the loans , even though she has , with New York prices , about $83 a month left after rent . <p> Student debt is not just a statistic in yearly College Board reports ; it tones the day-to-day experience of those so constrained . It has inflected the terms of my life , whether I can live in a smaller or larger apartment , buy a house ( not yet ) , travel , or eat out for dinner . It certainly influences my daughter 's life  --  whether she can have a pack of Ramen noodles or a proper meal for dinner , and how long she waits before going to the doctor when a sore throat might be strep . <p> And I was relatively lucky in the great academic job lottery . Now , as a full professor , I make a decent salary , $25,000 above the mean for American households . Hailing from the truck-driving classes , I 've made it , attaining a secure professional perch . But this is the American dream ? <p> DEBT STEALS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is not unique . Nearly two-thirds of those who received bachelor 's degrees in 2000 report having borrowed at some point to finance their education . The average four-year student loan debt in 2002 was $18,900 . It more than doubled from 1992 , when it was $9,200 . Added to that , for most students , is credit card debt , which averaged more than $2,300 in 2002 , raising the total owed to more than $21,000 . That figure has no doubt continued to climb . Bear in mind that the total does not include private loans , or the debt that parents take on , or postbaccalaureate loans , which have more than doubled from $18,572 in 1992-93 to $38,428 in 1999-2000 . Consequently student debt is , or will soon be , the new paradigm of early to middle-adult life , severely hampering the freedom college education is supposed to provide . <p> Two new books , Strapped : Why America 's 20- and 30-Somethings Ca n't Get Ahead ( Doubleday , 2006 ) by Tamara Draut and Generation Debt : Why Now Is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) by Anya Kamenetz , put student debt front and center in their reports of the hard times facing young adults . Student debt is the first roadblock on the route to the American dream ; the next are credit card debt ; the relative decline in wages over the past two decades ; the flight of middle-class jobs , and the rising cost of housing and raising a family . Another , less measurable factor is the feeling of political anomie  --  which some attribute to the poor attitude of lazy kids , but which these books show results more from a feeling of disenfranchisement . <p> Though the books , like many siblings , look alike from a distance  --  Draut in fact has a chapter called " Generation Debt "  --  they show distinct personality traits up close . Draut , a director of Demos , an independent think tank in New York , is the serious older sibling , whereas Kamenetz , a columnist for the Village Voice , is the more stylish younger sibling . The downside is that her solutions , in a last chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Draut has concrete policy suggestions  --  for instance , on converting loan aid to grants in a program weighted according to family income . Although Draut does not state it , her model is the GI Bill , which revolutionized the system of higher education because it gave grants to veterans to use at whichever college they chose . Draut estimates that such a program would cost $30 billion , which might seem expensive but which could be generated " by reversing the last Bush tax cut . " <p> A PROBLEM OF SOCIAL CLASS <p> While Strapped and Generation Debt are valuable in exposing the dire straits confronting young adults , they largely elaborate the story told in Douglas Coupland 's 1991 novel , Generation X. The shrunken prospects of that generation ( those born roughly between the early 1960s and the early 1980s ) received a good deal of commentary in the 1990s , and several books , notably Late Bloomers : Coming of Age in Today 's America : The Right Place at the Wrong Time by David Lipsky and Alexander Abrams , pinpointed problems like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Indentured Students . " <p> There is a tendency to render American history in terms of generations ( for instance , Generation X has also been designated as the " 13th Generation , " that is , the 13th from the American Revolution ) . There is also an attraction to thinking about social problems in terms of youth and age . But many of the problems that Draut and Kamenetz detail are not a result of age , but of class . Given that the average age of undergraduates has risen to the mid-20s , student debt is not just an issue of youth ; it is a question of rich and poor , of the fortunate third who can afford tuition upfront and those who ca n't . That is a question of equality and social justice . <p> The increasing financial burden that students and parents must bear represents several shifts in the idea of higher education . <p> The first involves the change from higher education as a public entitlement to a private service . The designers of the post-World War II university kept tuitions low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly from classes previously excluded . I call this the " welfare-state university " because it instantiated the policies and ethos of the postwar , liberal welfare state . <p> Now the paradigm for university financing is no longer a public entitlement primarily offset by the state but a privatized service , whereby each citizen has to pay a substantial portion of his or her own way . I call this the " post-welfare-state university " because it carries out the policies and ethos of the neoconservative dismantling of the welfare state . <p> Another shift involves the idea of higher education 's changing from primarily a social good to an individual good . In the postwar years , higher education was conceived of as a national mobilization , in part carrying over from the ethos of the war years , in part as a legacy of the New Deal , and in part as a response to the Cold War . Its unifying aim was for the social good , to produce the engineers , scientists and even humanists needed to strengthen the country . Now higher education is conceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better job and higher earning potential throughout one 's life , as endless reports tell us . <p> A TARIFF ON HOPE <p> Finally , the idea of higher education is changing from youthful exemption to market conscription , which is itself a shift in the vision of the future , particularly in the hope we have for our young <p> The traditional idea of education is based on social hope , providing an exemption from work for the younger members of society to explore their interests , develop their talents and receive useful training , in the belief that it will benefit society in the future . Society pays it forward . That assumption obviously applies to elementary and secondary education , and it extends to the university . <p> The welfare-state university promulgated a combination of ideal and utilitarian goals , providing inexpensive tuition and generous aid , and financing massive campus expansions . It offered an exemption not to grant leisure but to allow equal opportunity to achieve merit . The new paradigm sees the young not as a special group to be exempted or protected from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Debt puts a sizable tariff on social hope . <p> For students , that is , but not for banks . As currently instituted , student loans are more an entitlement for the banking industry than for students . The federal government pays the interest while one is enrolled in college and for a short grace period after graduation or leaving college , so it provides a modest " start-up , " as with a business loan , but no aid toward the actual principal . For lenders , the federal government insures the loans . In other words , banks bear no risk , and the structure of federal loan programs provides a safety net for banks . <p> There is no similar safety net for students . Even if you are in bankruptcy and are absolved of all credit card debt and other obligations , one debt you can not forgo is student loans . <p> We will not know the full effects of this system for at least 20 years , although one can reasonably predict it will not have the salutary effects that the GI Bill had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not go to college . According to data from the 1990s , the bottom quarter academically  --  the least qualified  --  of the wealthiest class of students is as likely to go to college as the top quarter  --  the most qualified  --  of the least wealthy students . Opportunity for higher education is hardly equal . <p> DEBT DICTATES CAREER CHOICES <p> We tend to think of student debt as a necessary evil attached to higher education but extraneous to the aims of higher education . If instead we see it as central to people 's actual experience of the university , what do we teach and what do they learn ? <p> Most rationales for higher education focus on idealistic principles . Even utilitarian rationales for job training assume that higher education provides students with a head start before entering adult life . <p> Instead , student debt teaches that higher education is a pay-as-you-go transaction , like any other consumer service , and that students are not special , but subject to the same business franchises attached to education . Rather than a head start , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also teaches career choices . Debt teaches that it would be a poor choice to wait tables while writing a novel , or to become an elementary school teacher at $24,000 , or to join the Peace Corps . <p> Nellie Mae , one of the major lenders , discounted the effect of loans on such choices . It reported on a student loan survey conducted in 2002 that found that only 17 percent of borrowers said student loans " had a significant impact on their career plans , " concluding that " the effect of student loans on career plans remains small . " That is dubious . Seventeen percent on any statistical survey is not negligible . <p> Further , the survey assessed students ' responses at the time of graduation  --  before they actually had to get jobs and pay bills , or simply when they saw things optimistically . <p> The survey is also skewed because it assumes that students decide on career plans tabula rasa . Most likely , students have already recognized the situation at the start of college  --  thus the warp in majors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts have faded , but that is not because students no longer care about poetry or philosophy ; rather , they have learned the illiberal lesson of the monetary world . <p> Finally , debt teaches civic lessons . It teaches that the university is not a space apart but a market . The market claims a certain fairness since , like a casino , anyone  --  black , green , or white  --  can lay their chips down . It is unfortunate if you do n't have many chips to lay down , but the house will spot you some , and having chips is a matter of the luck of the social draw . <p> There is a certain impermeability to the idea of the market : While you can fault social arrangements , whom do you fault for luck ? Some conservatives mourn the passing of civic culture ( captured in books like Robert D. Putnam 's Bowling Alone ) at the same time that they extol the market , but it is the permeation of market culture that has displaced civic culture . Scraping by , young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEW INDENTURED CLASS <p> The market justification for student debt is that those with college degrees make significantly more money over the course of a lifetime . That might hold true for some , particularly those with degrees in practical disciplines such as engineering or nursing , but over the past few years the value of a B.A. has declined . Even if a majority of students might benefit from a college education , a substantial percentage will face difficult times . And given the increase in debt and competition for jobs , it will only get worse . <p> Moreover , it is unclear how much debt is reasonable . There are formulas for court-ordered payments in bankruptcy , usually capped at 17 percent of one 's salary . If a graduate works for $18,000 a year and pays a monthly debt of $500 , that represents 33 percent of her pretax check , and nearly 50 percent of her take-home pay . That is a draconian burden unless one lives in a cardboard box . <p> Our present student loan system is penny-wise but future-foolish . Rather than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger society as well as individual students , we are creating a new indentured class . <p> Jeffrey J.
