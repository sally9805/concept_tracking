Let him cheat ? Q Should I let my child win ( and ignore his cheating ) when we play games ? A I 'm not the most indulgent parent , but even I think it 's all right to let your child win a round of Candy Land or Go Fish every now and then . Certain forms of cheating ( which you could term " creative play " ) might also be allowed if your child is n't sneaky about it . Look at it this way : Golfers have their handicaps . Why should n't a child sometimes be given an advantage to level the playing field ? Granted judiciously , an assisted win will not turn him into a sore-losing brat . Siblings , cousins , and friends will be there to see to it that he plays by the rules soon enough . But I would n't beat around the bush . Offer gaming advantages in an up-front manner instead of pretending you 're not helping him . Explain , for instance , that he 'll be given beginner 's help in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards when he needs it , such as when you 're way ahead . As soon as he does feel competent playing games ( which for most kids is n't until they 're 7 or 8 ) , he 'll prefer to win , and even lose , on his own . You might also consider setting up parent-child teams to play each other so the youngest family members can learn from the older ones . Sometimes , though , kids sneaky-cheat to win , especially as they get older and more competitive . I think you have to deal with this just as you 'd deal with lying-with zero tolerance . But mostly when little kids " cheat , " they 're not really cheating , they 're just not following the rules because they 're boring . What 's fun about playing a game is moving the little plastic man around the board until you land on your favorite color . In fact , the rules make it all less fun for most kids ages 3 to 5 . They invent and change the rules to their own games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play exactly as the mysterious words on the box say ? " Oh , so we 're going to play Crazy Candy Land , " says a dad I know when his child removes all of the " bad " cards from the deck so that no one will be sent back to hang with Plumpy after finally reaching Queen Frostine 's realm . Games can teach your child strategy , patience , perseverance , and other good things , but mainly they 're supposed to be fun . I 'm working too hard feeding my picky eaters Q I 'm tired of being a short-order cook every night . How can I stop making separate dinners for the kids ? A I , too , am a member of the short-order cooks ' club , and until recently I resented it . But I 've come to the conclusion that unless I 'm prepared to adopt a hard-line policy ( " Eat what I put on the table , or go hungry " ) - and I 'm not-then I 'm going to be serving more than one entree most nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't for me . I 've just accepted that kids and grown-ups have different tastes . That said , you do n't have to wear yourself out pleasing everybody . I now follow these rules : * Do n't ask your children what they 'd like for dinner-you 're not a food fairy godmother who can grant their every wish . * Tell them what you 're making them ( something you know they 'll eat ) , or give them two choices , tops . * If they ca n't agree , simply choose the one that suits you and tell the disgruntled diner you 'll honor his request tomorrow . * Keep it simple . A custom-made kid entree can be as unremarkable as some leftover pasta , a scrambled egg , or even some cheese and bread with fruit . I mean , it 's not as if you have to whip up a spinach souffle and a chanterelle millefeuille for dinner . You 're not alone , of course ; even globe-trotting epicures bump into this problem . Ruth Reichl , editor-in-chief of Gourmet , has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ french fries , chicken , parmesan cheese , vanilla ice cream , and scrambled eggs-at a time . " She says she learned to worry less about the lack of variety in her son 's diet ( which she countered with multivitamins ) and to focus on what was essential . " What I really care about is that meals be enjoyable family times , " she says . " The important thing about dinner is n't the details of what you serve . It 's that you sit down at the table together , enjoy each other 's company , and talk about the day . " Reichl 's son is now 14 , and he eats everything-including jellyfish . " But I do n't mention to him that I 'm pleased , " she says . Perhaps she 's still afraid to rock the boat . Like giving baths , combing out tangles , and tying shoelaces , this form of parental servitude , too , shall pass . Meanwhile , keep the dinner peace . My best pal drinks too much Q I was okay with my friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friend but do n't want her around my baby if she 's tipsy . Is it weird to suddenly confront her now ? A It 's surprising how many ways having a baby can change us . New mothers instinctively steer clear of dangerous people and situations , and on some level , your pal 's drinking , while maybe not something that worried you before , is pushing these maternal-instinct buttons in you now . You could probably line up a sitter whenever you 're going to socialize with your friend . But since you probably do n't even want to be around her when she 's drinking , why not set up nondrinking rendezvous ? Arrange weekday lunches , Saturday-morning coffee , and shopping-mall expeditions , with or without your baby in tow . But the main question is whether you should confront her , now that you 've realized she has a problem . If you want to keep her as a close friend-and take pleasure in her being part of your daughter 's life-then you owe it to her to say something . Just tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find treatment , and tell her you know she can work on this and get better . If she 's ready to change , your nudge may be the push she needs . It 's worth a try . Having a baby can bring out the greater mommy in us , and your pal may thank you for mommying her when she needed it most .
