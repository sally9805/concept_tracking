A city that was once the center of the world 's horrified attention is now a safe place again-but a sad place , where corruption reigns , opportunities are rare , and the young and the talented only want to get out // IT was always difficult to get into Sarajevo . The city sits in a bowl at the bottom of steep hills leading up to a series of mountains . Topographically , the nearest thing in America to the Bosnian capital is Aspen , Colorado , another place where the hills seem to rise right out of the town . Before the collapse of Yugoslavia and the beginning of the siege , Sarajevo , too , was a resort . But even in those last good days it was a peculiarly inaccessible resort . The airport was undependable and subject to fogs that closed it for days at a time . The roads into the city were indifferently maintained and in places badly graded . During the war Sarajevo 's weather and Sarajevo 's isolation were constant preoccupations , weighing on both the Sarajevans-for whom they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers who regularly traveled in and out of the city . Paradoxes abounded . On a foggy or snowy day the snipers could not see well enough , even through their high-powered scopes , to hit their targets-the civilians in Sarajevo 's streets-with any degree of accuracy . But bad weather also meant that humanitarian airlifts probably would be halted and visits from foreign dignitaries delayed . In the metaphorical sense as well as the literal , the situation on the ground would be frozen . The killing would temporarily be brought to a halt , which was welcome-but Sarajevo would disappear , fall off the television screen of international attention , as the snows fell or the mists descended . This was dangerous ; attention was all that kept the Serbs from escalating to wholesale slaughter . Photograph A schoolyard In Sarajevo , mined by departing Serbs // There was always a duality in Sarajevo 's status during those years of horror . On one level was the symbolic Sarajevo . This Sarajevo could at times dominate the world stage ; it was the most famous place on the globe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationality based on citizenship were fighting it out . The sufferings of the inhabitants of this Sarajevo weighed on the collective conscience of educated , affluent people in Western Europe and North America in a way that few human catastrophes of the past half century had done . On another level was a place you might call Sarajevo in its own right . This was a mid-sized Yugoslav city , where before the war people had lived relatively well , worked relatively little , and not asked themselves very deep questions . It had been in a modest way cosmopolitan , yes , but it had not been on the front line of anything except perhaps the Balkan dolce vita , and it had not been the capital of anything except Bosnia-Herzegovina . During the siege the two Sarajevos were almost in competition . Four years after the shelling stopped , the Sarajevo that endures is the smaller , more provincial one . In retrospect it is clear that the other , grander , identity was as much the function of the world 's expectations as of local Bosnian realities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world had placed on Sarajevans had cost them dearly-and I am not speaking only of the 10,000 dead , 3,000 of them children , during the four years of what a United Nations peacekeeping spokesman was once pleased to call " a tactically advantageous position . " What did surprise me was that on the night after this past Christmas , when I drove into Sarajevo for the first time in winter since the end of the siege , the city seemed almost as isolated as it had been during the war . It had snowed hard the week before-one of those Balkan storms in which the sky simply opens and dumps three feet of snow on the ground . But it had not been snowing as I had set out from Zagreb earlier in the day , and it was not snowing in the mountains outside Sarajevo . Still , the roads were virtually impassable . No one was firing at us , but in no other manner of difficulty did the trip seem all that different from trips in the days of the siege , when the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mount Igman . Stampi , a friend from Sarajevo who had come to pick me up in Croatia , just shrugged his shoulders when I expressed surprise that there were no snowplows or even traffic policemen along the route . " The government does nothing , " he said matter-of-factly . " It was different before . " " When ? " I asked . Stampi looked at me for a moment , his usually impassive face for once expressing almost exaggerated bewilderment . The question was too obvious to merit a response . But he gave one : " In Tito 's time , of course . " During the siege Stampi had worked variously as a driver for journalists and on the front line with a commando unit that he and his comrades dubbed " the Black Mambas . " Like many ex-fighters , he now owns a small cafe . His is called the Lady Bug , and it is located just behind the Holiday Inn where most of the journalists stayed during the siege . With his wife , Jadranka , he is now trying to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though Jadranka would later confide to me that they were barely making a profit , and managing that only by working twelve or fourteen hours a day . Stampi and Jadranka are in better shape than most couples in Bosnia these days . They are extremely enterprising people , and have little of the mixed resignation and sense of entitlement that may be communism 's most subversive legacy , not just to Bosnia but to the former Yugoslavia as a whole . Stampi and Jadranka simply got on with things . If he had to drive to Hungary to get parts for his car , he did so , and was hard at work the morning after his return . If she had to smile as the same small circle of customers regaled her with the same stories each day , that was what she did . And yet even if they said so only when pressed , it was clear that they both felt stymied , and that postwar Sarajevo felt to them more like an emerging backwater than a place of opportunity , which the end to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become . " Everyone I know talks of cars and clothes , " Jadranka told me . " For them , it 's as if the future does n't exist . " I SOON discovered that this diagnosis was shared by most of my old friends in the city . " Nothing is moving here , " Haris Pasovic , a theater director , said . " The war is over , but nothing is really happening . " " I am so angry , " he said . " I want my streets cleaned-like in New York or Uppsala . That 's not too much to ask of a government . " Pasovic was a well-known director in Novi Sad , in Serbia , before the war . After the siege began , he moved to Sarajevo , in the summer of 1992 . He entered the city in what in those days was the common fashion-making his way in the middle of the night to the edge of the last bit of Bosnian-controlled land , and then sprinting across the noman's-land of the airport tarmac to be arrested by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . Pasovic was one of the handful of people who tried to keep Sarajevo 's cultural life going during the siege , producing and directing plays , working on films chronicling the siege , and organizing festivals . Now , he told me , he is no longer interested in creating theater . " I want to know why this happened , " he said . " That 's what obsesses me . " And he paraphrased the German Marxist Theodor Adorno : " After Auschwitz it is impossible to write poetry . " No doubt Pasovic has personal reasons for going into a kind of internal exile . At the same time , though , his choice closely mirrors that of too many members of the Sarajevan elite for it to be without broader significance . Ademir Kenovic , the best filmmaker to remain in Sarajevo during the siege , lives in Mexico now . The arts and humanities departments at the University of Sarajevo have suffered crippling defections-not only many of the best professors but also the best students have left the country . The journalists who risked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruined building less than a hundred yards from the Serb front line have mostly emigrated . The paper 's editor , Kemal Kurspahic , lives in Washington ; his deputy , Gordana Knezevic , works for Reuters in Toronto ; and the foreign editor , Zlatko Dizdarevic , moves between Sarajevo and Italy . Among the children of this cultural elite the situation is , if anything , even more extreme . At a New Year 's Eve party at the **27;1124;TOOLONG Andre Malraux Cultural Center , Dizdarevic told me that his son had been visiting Sarajevo from the college in the American Midwest that he has attended for two years . " I knew he did n't want to come back here except for a holiday , " he said . " But what I had n't realized was that all his friends feel the same way . All they 're thinking about , as far as I can see , is leaving for good . " Zdravko Grebo , a law professor and a political activist who during the siege exemplified for foreigners and Sarajevans alike the genuinely liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still more emphatic . During the first two years of the war he ran George Soros 's Open Society Fund here and started the first truly independent radio station , Radio Zid . Now he interests himself all but exclusively in his work at the university . But he told me , " The best ones all want to get out of here . " " And what do you tell them ? " I asked . " What do you want me to tell them ? " he demanded . " I tell them that if they must go , then they should go . " He continued , " The funny thing is that they do n't just seem to want to leave Bosnia-they seem to want to get as far away from here as they possibly can . One of them told me recently that he wanted to eo to New Zealand . When I asked him why , he said , " Professor , it 's simple . If I go to Vienna or Frankfurt , I 'm bound to get drunk , start feeling nostalgic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I move to New Zealand , then coming back will be too damn expensive , and I 'll just wake up the next day with a hangover , rather than spoiling everything ! " ' For foreigners committed to Bosnia , including Francis Bueb , the director of the Malraux Center , these realities are painful and disconcerting . Bueb told me that he suspects that many of the promising young people who visit the center are really hoping to find a way to start a new life in France . " All most people here think of is money and emigration , " he said . " There was a brilliant young student who had the chance for a scholarship in Paris and wanted me to recommend her . For a long time I kept saying no , telling her that much as I esteemed her , I knew she would never come back to Bosnia once she left . But she insisted and insisted , and finally I gave in . Well , you can imagine the rest . She 's left for good ! " Grebo and Bueb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future of Sarajevo , though generally kept to themselves , are even gloomier than those of the young people they mentor . " A bottle with twenty glassesthat 's the economy here , " Grebo told me . Despite $5 billion in aid , the Bosnian authorities have proved largely incapable of restarting the economy . Unemployment is more than 50 percent , and although there is a vibrant cafe life , a growing bureaucracy , and an everincreasing black market , there is no economy in any serious sense of the term , nor any realistic prospect that one will develop anytime soon . Meanwhile , the money from the so-called stabilization fund is scheduled to run out at the end of this year , and it is by no means clear that either Washington or the European Union will continue to pour funds into Bosnia . Photograph If foreigners wo n't maintain the city , why should anyone else ? // Like many Sarajevans , Grebo was harsh in his indictment of the Bosnian authorities-Muslim , Croat , and Serb alike . " Nothing has changed here politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who were in power when the war started are still in power , and you saw where their genius got Bosnia . You do n't have a state here . Or , rather , you have three ethnic groups in a Dayton state , but no society . Sarajevo looks all right , but inside it is destroyed . And people vote for the parties they think will protect them from the other national groups . " THERE are those in Sarajevo who believe that the problem has been the West 's unwillingness to really take charge . Once the fighting stopped , the major powers were content to pursue a thoughtless , hollow democratization . " We were n't ready for local elections in 1996 , " Zlatko Dizdarevic told me , " but the Europeans and the Americans were determined that they take place , even though they knew that only the national parties had any chance of winning . So the result is that we have formal democracy but in reality a system in which ordinary people complain about their respective leaders but wind up voting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other national groups than they are disgusted with the leaders they have . " Dizdarevic believes that Bosnia 's leaders are incapable of thinking about the needs of ordinary people-not just because they are venal but also because they have been conditioned to think only about problems that pit nationality against nationality . A problem like snow removal simply does not register with them . Something of this same attitude was present during the siege . I remember returning to Sarajevo after a fairly prolonged absence and realizing that the streets , which UN peacekeepers had begun to clean up in the summer of 1994 , were now filthy again . It turned out that the explanation for this was a change in UN force commanders in Sarajevo . Sir Michael Rose had been obsessed with clean streets ; his successor , Rupert Smith , was as interested in confronting the Serbs as Rose had been in understanding them , but he did not think that Sarajevo 's sanitation problems were his or his soldiers ' affair . By chance , I was able to put the question to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations with the UN . Even though there was little shelling in this period , Muratovic was categorical : " Cleaning the streets is the UN 's job . " This attitude so permeates Sarajevo that only on January 3 , two weeks after the most recent snow had fallen , were the perfectly serviceable snowplows and street sweepers-bought for the municipal authorities with European Union funds-actually deployed . In the interim I did not see a single Bosnian sweeping a street or even clearing a passage to his or her own place of business . The assumption seemed to be that if the foreigners would n't do it and the local authorities could not be bothered with it , there was no reason for anyone else to do a thing . " Of course we would have done such things in Tito 's time , " Hrvoje Batinic , an official of the Open Society Fund in Bosnia , declared flatly . " But in those days there was a punishment if you did not do such civic-minded things , whereas today there are no such consequences . " Batinic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , mused over the changes in Sarajevo since the siege ended . " This is not a city anymore-it 's a village , " he said . " And it 's not even a proper village . " He continued , " I would not say for a moment that I miss the siege . That would be inhuman . I do not miss children 's being murdered and people 's being blown to bits on water lines . But I confess that I do miss the way I was , the kind of person I was , during the siege . I was better ; many of us were . You may say that this is a ridiculous feeling , but I believe that it is an accurate one . So many of us were better during the siege . " To be nostalgic for a great ordeal is probably hard-wired into most of us . What made this sentiment different , and more troubling , was that it seemed to have paralyzed ordinary Sarajevans , rendering them almost incapable of living productively in the present , let alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to prove as challenging as anything they have faced since the siege ended . For Sarajevo , as for Bosnia generally , 2000 is not just the overcommercialized commencement of a new millennium ( for the Muslims of Sarajevo , after all , the year is 1421 ; for the dwindling population of observant Jews it is 5760 ) . It is the year when the country will either begin to right itself or begin to be abandoned by what is called the international community-because the foreigners are getting more and more fed up . To them , the Bosnians seem content to remain permanent wards of Europe and America . When foreign diplomats and aid workers are among themselves , they speak contemptuously of this attitude . They tell stories of corruption with the same obsessiveness with which residents of large U.S. cities used to tell stories of street crime . And even leftists who loathed Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan routinely use language that either of those two scourges of the " undeserving " poor would have found comfortingly familiar . A European diplomat I know told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will get back on track . " We 're willing to station troops here indefinitely , to make sure the war does n't break out again , " he said . " But we will not take political responsibility for Bosnia . My sense is that slowly the foreigners will leave . The Soros foundation is already on the brink of closing , and others will certainly follow . Soros has all but said that he thinks the Bosnians are failures . He can be frank because he 's a billionaire . But I assure you that this is what a great many people in the embassies , in the Office of the High Representative , and in other foreign offices in this city believe as well . The Bosnians had better be careful . If they are n't , they may find themselves alone again . " Many Sarajevans , and not just members of the elite like Grebo , understand the ramifications of this perfectly . A depressingly large number of the people who are doing well in the city these days are doing so only through contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unemployment here is sixty-five percent , " he said . " I employ twelve people and pay them a decent salary . And they , in turn , are probably each supporting six or eight people . If I were to close the center , I would effectively leave almost a hundred people without support . Pensions are nonexistent ; local salaries are pitiful . There are only the foreigners . The foreigners and corruption . " DURING the early summer of 1994 , at the beginning of the third year of the siege , my friends in the city took to making elaborate predictions about what the Bosnian capital would be like at the turn of the millennium . Sarajevans had much better things to do than worry about where they would be in 2000 . Just getting through the day unscathed was a sufficiently ambitious undertaking . But somehow there was something appealingly ironic to my Sarajevan friends about the idea that their city was on the brink of destruction only a few years before the beginning of a new century . " I do n't even know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " my young friend Una Sekerez , who worked for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , once said to me . To the Bosnian poet Ferida Durakovic , the future seemed likely to hold something more grotesque . " We are already a theme park of suffering for you foreigners , " she said , " so if we lose , maybe the Serbs will turn the whole place into some kind of commemoration of Greater Serbia-like Kosovo field , only this time commemorating a great Serb victory , not a defeat . " Her friend the painter Branka Vukic nodded in agreement . " And if they do n't , maybe the UN and you in the West will turn Sarajevo into some kind of living monument to the way things used to be here , before we were all killed or dispersed , complete with UNESCO certification . " In those days the millennium was an idea in much the way that " multicultural " Sarajevo was an idea . For some of the young Sarajevans I came to know during the siege , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would like so much to be here when the millennium turns , " a young soldier told me one evening in a black-market restaurant directly across from the Orthodox cathedral in the center of town . " That would be our greatest revenge on the world that is content to feed us and let the snipers do their work . We would have survived . I would walk with my parents from one end of the city to the other , from the tower blocks of Alipasino Polje to the old town , and then up into the hills beyond , where the first line is today . I 'd dance in front of the National Theater , and stand along the Miljacka by that stupid bridge where that cretinous Serb killed the archduke , and kiss my girlfriend . And when I heard the fireworks , I would n't run for cover , or flinch , or look around to see if anyone had been hit . I 'd shout with excitement , the way I did when I was a child . If I 'm alive , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that soldier survived the war , let alone whether , like me , he was at the celebration in front of the National Theater on the night of December 31 , 1999 . What I do know is that in many ways the evening was just as he had imagined it . The fireworks did go off , to the delight of the young and the visible dismay of the few middle-aged and elderly people in the crowd . The rock music blared late into the night . Young couples were making out along the river , or walking through the streets of the old town , past refurbished shops and under strings of Christmas lights . I have been back to Sarajevo at least once a year since the war ended , and I expect I will continue to return-if only because of what I lived through during the siege . Sarajevans I know are rather startled by this , so deep is their sense of defeat . There is , after all , not a single negative thing an outsider can say about Sarajevo that Sarajevans themselves will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is a Sarajevo at all seems miraculous to me . Still , I can not deny , any more than my Sarajevan friends can , that the city we knew during the war 's worst moments is gone , probably for good . " In 1992 and 1993 we had a chance to become the city we thought we could be , " Zdravko Grebo told me . " It did not happen . This has become a little town again , a little town in the middle of nowhere , off in a corner of Europe . " A little town that was briefly the most famous place in the world , I said . " That town existed , " he replied . " But now it 's gone . " <p>
