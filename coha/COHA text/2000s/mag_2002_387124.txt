Babies are n't the only ones who have a lot to learn the first year // Hindsight is 20/20 . Here , moms and dads share the advice they wish someone had given them the first year THERE 'S NOTHING AS EXHILARATING AS BECOMING A PARENTand nothing so confusing and nerve-racking . To the rescue : the seasoned moms and dads who 've survived round-theclock feedings , sleepless nights , crying fits , and , of course , the first words and other priceless moments that make it all worthwhile . Here , they tell what they would have done differently-so you can get started on the right foot : Capturing the Magic Photograph // " I 'd have given Danielle and Jessica even more hugs and kisses because with infants you do n't need to ask first . " - MICHAEL GROSS , BOCA RATON , FL " I would have carried a camera with me everywhere . Then I could have taken pictures of all of those spontaneous moments , like Casey 's first crawl , his first time in the snow , his first ice cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . " - TERI NUNIS , SOUTHLAKE , TX " After my son was born , I would have asked for more than a few days off from work . I 'm from France , where it 's common for men to take three or four weeks of paternity leave . I feel cheated that I missed those first weeks of fatherhood. " - PAUL CLAVEAU , ORLANDO " When Gensen rolled over , I clapped and moved on to the next milestones-sitting up , then crawling , then walking . I wish I could have slowed down and savored every little thing she did . It seemed like that first year was over before I knew it . " - KAMI MADISON , HIGGINSVILLE , MO Sleeptime Solutions " I should have let T.J. nap in his stroller instead of always having him sleep in his crib . He became so attached to sleeping at home that it was hard to travel with him anywhere . And now he still wo n't sleep anywhere except his bedroom-not even at Grandma 's house . " - STEPHANIE RANSOM , MERRICK , NY " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to sleep herself . As soon as she cried , I went to her , and now we 're in major trouble . She 's two and still wo n't go to sleep on her own-either my husband or I have to lie down with her . We get to bond , but it 's very time-consuming . " - DOT SENNE , DAYTONA BEACH , FL " I would have had our son sleep in his crib . He slept in our bed , and it took four years to get him out ! At one point during my wife 's second pregnancy , he was tossing and turning so much that he was accidentally kicking her . She actually had to sleep on the floor ! " - PAUL SILVERSTEIN , NEW YORK CITY " I wish I 'd had my twins sleep in my room immediately . By the time I 'd hear them and walk to their room , they were screaming and all frazzled . It was hard to settle them down , and the whole nursing process took a lot longer than it should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my room , and it was a million times easier-Id sense them stirring , nurse them , and put them right back down without having to fully wake up . They stayed in my room until they were five months old . " - LESLIE LIDO , MERRICK , NY Love Objects " We would have kept my son 's blankets and stuffed animals in his bedroom . The sacred items are less likely to get lost this way-and when they 're missing , bedtime 's a nightmare . " - PATTI NAIM , BRECKSVILLE , OH " I 'd have taken Brooke 's pacifier away before she was a year old . While it was great for when she was cranky , now that she 's two , we have a big problem . She 's really addicted to her Binkies and has ten in her crib alone . If I had taken them away when she was younger , she would have cried and gotten over it . Now it 's going to be a long haul to get rid of them . " - RANDI KAMER , CHAPPAQUA , NY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play independently . From the start , I was in his face , singing , playing , or talking just about every moment he was awake . Now Joseph is three and still very dependent on me and my husband : He often says , " I want you to do it , Mommy , " when he 's trying to put a tower of blocks together or find a particular toy . I think there 's a better balance of playing with your baby and letting him be alone a bit too . " - HOLLY SCHMIDT , BAY VILLAGE , OH The Right Stuff " I did n't need to run out and get every baby gadget on the market . I used to buy everything , from self-feeding bottles to special pacifier cleaners , and carry it all around in my diaper bag , which weighed three hundred pounds . But after using each item once or twice , I realized that most of them were n't helpful . " - HILLARY STEINBERG , BRIARCLIFF MANOR , NY " When I received clothes for my newborn , I should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear something in particular . Instead , I washed them all and hung them in his closet right away . Austin grew so fast that he got to wear every outfit only once-or not at all . And by then , it was too late to exchange them for a bigger size . " Photograph " I wish I had breastfed Troy longer than four months . I stopped because at the time I felt it was a hassle and tying me down . If I could do it over again , I 'd pump and allow others to feed the baby . " - LIZA TAYLOR , TUCSON , AZ // - KIM MENARD , OVIEDO , FL " I would n't have bought so many toys . They wound up all over our house , while our daughter ended up playing with things like tissue boxes . Often , all babies really want is to play peekaboo and patty-cake-anything that lets them interact with you . " - MARY FOSNOW , McHENRY , IL " Instead of waiting five months , I would have bought a Baby Bjorn carrier as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Your arms do n't get tired and you can do anything-eat , clean your house-with the baby right there . My husband and I wore that thing out and never had to use a stroller. " - TRISH BARNARD , ORLANDO Time to Eat " I 'd have served Emma whatever my husband and I were eating for dinner rather than make her a separate meal , so she could get used to the spices and sauces . Now she 'll only eat things like plain noodles , hot dogs , and special veggies , while my youngest eats whatever I 've cooked because that 's what I 've always given her . " - LISA COHEN-DUMANI , GAITHERSBURG , MD " I should have taught my daughter that dinnertime is family time-meaning we sit at the table together . I was so obsessed with Elizabeth 's lack of eating that I would put her in front of the TV and hand-feed her until she finished her meal . Guess what ? Three years later , I still often have to do the same to get her to eat . " - NANCY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had contacted La Leche League , an international organization of breastfeeding mothers , sooner , I could have avoided some basic nursing difficulties , like cracked nipples and trouble latching on . I went to a lactation consultant who charged eighty-five dollars , but I could have gotten the same information free . " - NATALIA LADUCA-APARICIO , NEWTOWN , CT Trusting Intuition " I would n't be so sensitive about unsolicited advice . People often assume that new moms have no clue and give their opinions on everything from teething to diapering . At the time , I 'd think , Do n't they know I 'm trying my best and I 'm a good parent ? ' But now I 'd tell them , " I know what I 'm doing . I did n't ask for your advice . " ' - MARY STANFORD , EL SEGUNDO , CA Photograph " If I had to raise a baby again , I would relax . I worried about every detail of my daughter 's life , like whether she peed often enough or was too hot or too cold . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will cry if she 's uncomfortable . " - CANDACE AUSTRICH , PALM HARBOR , FL // " I should have told my husband that I was nervous about being a new mom . I was afraid it meant I was n't a good mother . And because I never said anything , my husband still thinks I have all the answers and it 's hard for him to understand that I sometimes don't. " - KATHY MARCH , LAWRENCEVILLE , GA " I would n't have been so militant . I was like a dictator with my husband : Change her diaper this way , hold her that way , play with her now . I forgot that dads have their own special ways with babies too . " - MARINA LEUNG , FLUSHING , NY " Me " Time " I wish I had pushed myself to get out of the house once in a while and meet other moms or have breakfast in a neighborhood restaurant . In the beginning , I felt like I was a clock watcher-my whole focus was wake , feed , do chores around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolated and detached . " - KELLI YI , WESTCHESTER , CA " There was this energy vacuum when our daughter first arrived-she drew all the attention away from me and my wife . I should have made it a priority that we reconnect and redefine our marriage . After a year , our dynamic as a couple was gone . We had to go back and figure out how to balance our relationship with this new entity in the middle of it . Now we make sure that we always take time for us. " - DOUGLAS BREITBART , RIDGEWOOD , NJ " I 'd accept the fact that I am not Supermom : I would have taken a day off from work occasionally and left my son at daycare , or I would 've put him to bed earlier and taken a hot bath . I think that some time apart makes moments you have together more enjoyable . After all , it 's the quality , not the quantity , that counts .
