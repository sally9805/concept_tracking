Mary Todd Lexington , Kentucky I HAVE LONG SINCE learned not to believe idle stories . Heaven knows I grew up on them . For years as a child I was terrorized by family stories of great Uncle John being killed at Blue Licks by Indians . Or how Uncle John escaped from Indians after running a gauntlet and his brother Sam was captured and Uncle John ransomed him for a barrel of whiskey . Not to mention Mammy Sally 's stories about Jaybird reporting once a week to the Almighty about our misdoings for which , somehow , we 'd be punished . Jaybird reported only to God , she said . But for some reason I did believe the rumor told to me by my sisters Frances and Elizabeth of how , only weeks after our mother 's burial , our father was courting another woman . I believe it because my older sisters were friends with Dr. Warfield 's daughter , Claire . And he 'd been in attendance at my mother 's death and was a friend of my father . They tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father goes frequently because he is a state senator . They say she has a seventy-three-year-old mother who is the head of society there . That she herself wants to be called Betsy , and that she hopes to lift our family tonew standards of elegance . Grandmother Parker , who lives just up the hill from us here in Lexington and is my own mother 's ma , says it is an indecently short time after Ma 's death for Pa to go courting . My sister Frances says Pa sent his new lady a miniature of himself painted by Lexington 's own Matthew Jouett . Elizabeth Humphreys she is called . I made it my business to find out everything I could about her . She is no stranger to Lexington . Two of her uncles taught here at our Transylvania college . She is going to bring her own black servants with her when she comes . I wonder how that will sit with Mammy Sally . Jaybird can tell God all he wants about me . I know already that I do not like her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent courtship of Pa 's . Auntie Ann , his sister , who ran the household since Ma died , warned us not to ask him about it . So we did n't . But we watched him closely at the dinner table to see if he was changing toward us . For all we could see , he was n't . He still asked Levi if he 'd been a good boy that day and ruffled his hair when he asked it . He still told my spoiled sister Ann how pretty she was . He still discussed social matters with Elizabeth and Frances . And he still promised me a pony if I was a good girl . He 'd been promising me a pony for ages . As long as he kept promising , I figured my hope for a pony was still alive . Though I did wonder if a pony would fit in with Betsy 's idea of a new standard of elegance . No , he was n't changing toward us . He was still Pa , who loved us and would n't let anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father called us all into the front parlor after dinner and cleared up the rumors . I was seven years old . " My situation has become irksome , " he said . " People of ill will are saying bad things about me and my intended , Elizabeth Humphreys . So I have become engaged to this dear lady and hope soon to wed . I need to complete my domestic circle so I can enjoy the repose and happiness which the world can never give . " Pa talked high words sometimes . But we understood . Frances and Elizabeth kissed him . I hugged him because I was n't going to be left out of any part of his domestic circle . THAT 'S HOW WE LEARNED we were to get a stepmother . But I did n't see the need for one . As far as I was concerned , the domestic circle we had was complete enough . Mammy Sally ran the kitchen and the other servants . And I did n't see anything wrong with Auntie Ann running the house . She even did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disciplined the servants , and bought the staples . Only bone I had to pick with her was that she favored my little sister Ann too much . Ann was the darling of her eye . I was almost eight the year Pa wed and Ann was going on two , and Ann took all the attention from me . Same as she 'd taken my name when she was born . I was Mary Ann up until then , until they gave the second part of my name to her , and now I 'm only Mary . It 's a lonely name , I can tell you . It needs a second part . Anybody can see that . Elizabeth and Frances have their own set of fine-feathered girlfriends who ca n't talk about anything but dresses and boys . Levi , a year older than me , and George , only one at the time , had the full attention and love of Pa . All I had was Grandma Parker to stand up for me . And she was fifty-two . I HAVE HAD A LOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting a stepmother was the first of them . Now that I am nineteen and about to leave Lexington , Kentucky , to live with my sister Elizabeth and her husband in Springfield , Illinois , I can write of them without hurting too much . Before I was three years old I lost my place as the youngest in the family to brother Robert when he was born . When I was four I lost my baby brother . Robert died at fourteen months . I was uncommonly fond of Robert and his death affected me terribly . Then when I was five I lost part of my name . At seven I lost my mother when my next brother , George Rogers Clark Todd , was born . At almost eight I got a new stepmother . WE WERE TO CALL her " Ma " Pa told us in one of the most stern moments I ever recollect seeing him in . " Not Betsy , but Ma . " We all said yes . " And if you have any concerns about the household , bring them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concerns about the household ? I 'd had nothing but concerns since Auntie Ann had left us , as soon as Pa and Betsy came home from their wedding trip . Concerns about the household ? That phrase went through my mind as I stood in the kitchen and watched , transfixed , as Judy , one of Betsy 's slaves , stood grim-faced , her two hands holding a large bowl of soup . I could smell the soup from where I stood . I loved that soup , all made with preserves from our garden . Across the kitchen stood Mammy Sally , who had made the soup . She 'd caught Judy sampling it from the serving bowl and scolded her . " Here , take your ol ' soup , " Judy said and threw the bowl on the floor . The smash of the china bowl sounded throughout the house . The soup splashed all over the place . I even got some on the hem of my dress . Mammy Sally backed away , held her hands to her face , and cried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outof the kitchen . Just then Pa appeared at the kitchen doorway . " What is this ? What 's going on here ? " " Judy threw the soup on the floor , " I told him . He looked shocked . I felt sorry for him . So much for repose and happiness , I thought . And , as if he could read my thoughts , he looked at me . " Mary , go and get your mother , " he said quietly . Then he turned and went back into his study . For a moment I thought that he really meant my mother . The look on his face was so confused that for all I knew he could have been wanting her then , just like I was . But I ran upstairs to get Betsy . She was seated at her dressing table , making up her hair . " What 's all the noise ? " she asked . I just stood there like a jackass in the rain . " Ma , " my voice cracked when I said it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any soup for supper . " " And why is that ? " " Judy threw it on the floor . " " Well , she must have had provocation . " So that was the way it was to be . Her servants could do no wrong . " Pa needs you , " I said . She stood up . " Is there no order in this house ? " I shrugged . " Your Judy threw the soup when Mammy Sally found her eating out of the serving bowl . " " There must be more to it than that . " New standards of elegance , I thought . " And you do n't have to look so pained when you call me Ma , either . Now say it again . And say it strong . " I swallowed . " Ma , " I said . " Again . " Tears came to my eyes . " Ma . " She swept past me . " I hope I do n't have to speak to your father about you .
