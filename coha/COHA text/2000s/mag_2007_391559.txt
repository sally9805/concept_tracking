SysTech 's wireless system collects auto pollution data automatically . FIFTEEN YEARS AFTER receiving his first patent for an automobile-emissions testing device and ten years after founding a company to build and market emissions-testing systems , Pradeep Tripathi has learned a thing or two about his niche . He knows , for example , that neither consumers nor regulators like the current setup . Drivers regard the annual emissions test as a pain and regulators question the value of a system that gives them only one shot a year  --  in some places , once every two years  --  to certify that a car meets emissions standards . " In between , it could be polluting like crazy , and no one will ever know , " says Tripathi . These insights helped lead the 39-year-old Purdue University  --  trained engineer to what he thinks will be a breakthrough product for SysTech International , his 110-employee firm in Murray , Utah . SysTech spent nearly $500,000 to develop a matchbook-sized device that connects to a car 's onboard computer and continuously collects emissions data , which it then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The goal is to save motorists time , reduce emissions , and eventually eliminate the need for inspection stations . Once they 've been installed by a mechanic , the monitors work like the E-ZPass toll system , beaming data to radio antennas that relay the information to state agencies . The data is transmitted as the motorist takes a drive past one of SysTech 's remote onboard diagnostic ( OBD ) access points . ( The company hopes to have 150 points set up by the end of 2008 As of now , there are a few dozen points in Oregon and Maryland . ) If a car is out of compliance , the owner receives a warning by mail , e-mail , or fax and typically has 45 days to fix the problem . If the car is running clean , the owner gets an annual inspection sticker in the mail . Drivers can forget about scheduling an appointment for an emissions test , and regulators have a new tool to enforce emissions regulations . This new tool comes in handy right now , because many states are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have usually required new testing equipment , but the Remote OBD system could make changing the rules easier . " States were primed to spend a lot of money retooling their emissions-testing outfits , " says Gene Tierney , senior policy analyst at the Environmental Protection Agency . " But then SysTech 's continuous test comes along , and now they wo n't have to . " Instead of recalibrating or replacing test equipment installed at hundreds of inspection stations , states can enforce new standards by having SysTech simply change the programs in its centralized computers . So far SysTech has won contracts for tests in Oregon , and Maryland is trying the system in 100 taxis . Oregon committed to buying 10,000 Remote OBD units and related systems for collecting emissions data this year , and began offering transponders to motorists on June 1 , primarily in more densely populated areas such as Portland . Because of the cost  --  $50 a vehicle  --  remote monitoring is not likely to become a requirement in Oregon or elsewhere , Tripathi says . Also , the system works only on post-1995 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the setup may not appeal to drivers who are leery about installing a device in their cars that can be used to track their movements . But even if a relative handful of motorists choose the system , it could make a huge difference in SysTech 's fortunes . By the end of next year , Tripathi predicts , Oregon will take 200,000 units . That would cover about 13% of the more than 1.5 million registered private vehicles in the state , and would generate $10 million in sales , or about 40% of SysTech 's projected 2008 revenue . The company had sales of $8 million last year and expects to finish 2007 with more than $18 million , thanks to business in Nashville and Rhode Island and a $2 million  --  plus boost from a new product that measures small fuel-tank leaks in vehicles . Other states , including Massachusetts , Missouri , New Jersey , Tennessee , and Wisconsin , are considering remote monitoring . And the EPA is also involved , giving extra pollution credits to states that adopt new technology like SysTech 's . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been contracting because of falling hardware prices and a 50% drop in annual inspection station fees during the past decade . SysTech 's lead in remote diagnostics could put it in position to capture the new wave of demand that Tripathi expects as the EPA takes on greenhouse gases . " When I factored in the cost and time savings for the consumer , " he says , " I knew it was a winner . " This article originally appeared in FSB : Fortune Small Business magazine .
