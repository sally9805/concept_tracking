Preteen popper Aaron Carter and hip-hopper Lil Bow Wow usher in a new wave of pesky juvenile offenders by David Browne Photograph THE GREEN PARTY Bow Wow ( left ) and Carter are two too premature // FOR A SYMPATHETIC MO ment , consider the fate of the current teen idols . Despite fame , fortune , and , in some cases , fledgling facial hair , they 're blessed with as many doomsayers as fans . At the recent MTV Video Music Awards ; Britney Spears attempted to shed her adolescent imagegranted , with a dual homage to Flashdance and Stripteaseonly to be greeted with snickers and media scolding about her skin baring . The Backstreet Boys will be considered passe if the first-week sales of their forthcoming album do n't surpass those of " N Sync 's or Spears " latest . And the very industry that spawned them is preparing for their inevitable obsolescence by grooming a new wave of grade-school stars , like pip-squeak country-pop warbler Billy Gilman , to take their place . Not only will the Backstreet Boys eventually be supplanted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family : Aaron Carter , Nick 's 12-year-old sibling . For the moment , big brother need n't be concerned . Aaron 's Party ( Come Get It ) , the younger Carter 's first album for Jive ( also the Boys ' label ) , is a collection of rhythmic , ultradisposable jingles delivered in the chirpy voice of its leading tyke . Aaron 's Party is very much a preadolescent 's album . In the songs , the obnoxiously precocious Aaron chats online and puts one over on his parents with a secret party , and silly between-song skits are devoted to prank phone calls and ordering doughnuts in the recording studio . Had Zac Hanson made a solo album during his hyperactive phase three years ago , this is how it might have sounded . If the humor is appropriately childish , so is the music . " Girl You Shine " and " Bounce " are competent lunchbox pop , but the overproduced clatter , complete with dated synth handclaps , is teeth-gratingly cute , and remakes of " I Want Candy " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impress adults rather than make good listening . And even though he tosses in hip-hop lingo- " AC 's in the house ! " - and calls himself " the flyest kid on the block , " little Aaron seems more an heir to the Uberwholesome Osmonds than to his brother 's band . Carter 's playground high jinks are distinctive in one way : They set him apart from his competition , who all aim to be far beyond their years and shoe sizes . Gilman 's honkyTonka-Toy debut , the hit One Voice , is filled with melancholy heartbreak ballads delivered in a timbre that makes him sound like a young Reba McEntire . Similarly , Lil ' Bow Wow , the 13-year-old protege of Snoop Dogg , is caught somewhere between a crib ( as in " child 's bed " ) and a crib ( as in rap slang for " home " ) . Sounding as if he did n't dare crack a smile during the sessions , the former Shad Moss sternly brags about " the dog in me " on his debut album , Beware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wealthy and famous ( the rubbery single " Bounce with Me ' ' ) or advises fans to " make room next to your Backstreet poster/ " cuz Bow Wow 's here and it 's over , " this grim rapper takes his cues from Snoop and Ice Cube rather than the exuberant young Michael Jackson ( to whom Bow Wow is compared , prematurely , in a press release ) . In " Bounce With Me , " he warns : " And I ought a snatch up yo " daughter/But I was brought up with respect/When I turn 16 I 'm a-call her , though/And show her how to ride with a baller . " Kids today-they rap the darndest things . The cornrowed Bow Wow is talented , as he demonstrates with a few displays of licketysplit rhyming , and producer Jermaine Dupri finds an agreeable balance between Nickelodeon-channel pop and genuine hip-hop , as he did with Kris Kross a decade ago . Dupri keeps the midtempo beats and flows uncomplicated and uncluttered , and cameos by Snoop , Da Brat , and Xscape add grown-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about grown-up : The slinky " Ghetto Girls " is built on a sample by the old-school fusion band the Crusaders . ) It also helps that at 34 minutes , the album is half the length of an average disc . The lil ' in Bow Wow peeks out occasionally : In " Puppy Love , " he takes a date to the mall and Six Flags but cautions her , " I 'm not trying to get serious until I 'm in my 20s . " Soon enough , though , he 's telling us about the 18-year-old who came on to him and fantasizing about " trying to escort Aaliyah or somebody to Soul Train .
