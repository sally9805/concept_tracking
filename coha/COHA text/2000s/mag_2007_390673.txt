What if , in the name of comfort , you took the squishy foam used to cushion running shoes , and instead of sandwiching it between the foot bed and sole , you made an entire shoe out of the stuff ? Pretty simple , really . All you 'd have to do would be to blend together the standard plastic resins supplied in bulk by chemical companies like DuPont and Dow , add color and heat , and inject the resulting goo into a mold , say , shaped like a Swedish clog . Tiny air bubbles would form and then , within a few seconds , out would pop a shoe that was not only cushy and comfortable but form-fitting , too . It would weigh barely more than a Nerf ball . And because of its closed-cell foam , it 'd be both waterproof and odor-resistant . It would get great traction , too ; it would n't even scuff . Best of all , unlike conventional shoes , whose production typically requires that dozens of components be sewn and glued together , this shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to knock out as squeezing shapes from a Play-Doh Fun Factory . It would be so cheap to manufacture that you could price it at $29.99 a pair and walk away with a fat profit . " It 's the kind of simple genius that makes you ask , " Why did n't I think of that ? ' ' " Robert Neilley , a longtime industry watcher and editor of Injection Molding Magazine , says about the idea . It 's also an idea that last year helped make Crocs the most successful initial public offering in footwear history  --  with the stock now near an all-time high of $60 per share and a market cap approaching $5 billion . First introduced in 2002 , the comfy , so-ugly-they're-cute plastic shoes have since logged over $1.2 billion in sales , three quarters of which was earned in the past year alone . Profits are expected to more than double this year to $164 million , thanks to wide gross margins of 59 percent , a rapidly expanding line of more than 50 styles , and a worldwide manufacturing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the quintessential example of how to profit from consumers ' growing obsession with comfort , a trend that is fast turning not just the shoe business but also the entire fashion industry inside out . It 's the " latest step in our unending quest to dress as casually as possible , " talk show host Bill Maher recently complained of the Crocs craze . " You know , I used to wear flip-flops , but they 're a little dressy . I want clothing I can hose down ! " Such caricatures of today 's consumers may seem extreme , but " just go to the malls , and you 'll see . It 's pajama pants , hoodies , and flip-flops , " says Marshal Cohen , chief industry analyst at the NPD Group , who estimates that the molded footwear business is now worth $2.2 billion a year . And it 's not just the kids . " Style used to be No. 1 . But now it 's all about comfort and value , and the people at Crocs have capitalized on that trend brilliantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on when Scott Seamans initially pushed the spongy clogs on his friends George Boedecker and Lyndon Hanson in 2002 . " At first , I just thought they were ugly , " Hanson recalls of the day his longtime college buddy insisted he don a pair during a four-day sailing trip from Mexico to Miami . " But they were really comfortable . " Sure-footedness . Sporting perforated holes to drain water away and tiny " circulation nubs " to ease muscle strain under the foot , the shoe had been created by a small Canadian plastics company for use in day spas . " But Scotty thought they 'd make great boat shoes , " Hanson says . A born tinkerer , Seamans had already begun tweaking the shoe , using medical rivets ( the same kind used to secure torn ligaments ) to attach a plastic strap around the heel , which added a certain sure-footedness needed to maneuver around a boat deck . By the end of their sailing trip , the three friends had agreed to start a new business selling the modified shoe to boaters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side view resembles a crocodile 's snout ) , they priced a pair at $29.99 . It hit a sweet spot ; customers crowded around the Crocs booths that the founders set up at boat shows early on , and the shoes soon became popular with nurses , cooks , and others on their feet all day and in need of a shoe that could be washed down after every shift . ( Indeed , the Crocs medical line was deemed so comfortable that the American Podiatric Medical Association endorsed it as an alternative to flip-flops . ) " They started buying them by the hundreds , " retailer Gordon Reddick recalls of a medical company near his Wrightsville Beach , N.C. , shop , which first sold the shoes in basic neutrals : black , white , and brown . " But then people started asking for them in colors . And then the kids came in . And now , well , you do n't even want to get near that corner of the store when the new Crocs products come in . " The initial buzz  --  spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Iron Chef Mario Batali showed off his orange pair to TV audiences . ( He 's since entered into a partnership with Crocs . ) Jack Nicholson sported a blue pair , Faith Hill a tan pair , and when Britney Spears jumped on the bandwagon , she reportedly bought the shoes in every color . ( There are 27 currently available . ) Even President George W. Bush was recently spotted in black Crocs as he headed out for a bike ride . Inevitably , the attention has sparked a backlash against the shoes  --  these days it 's arguably as fashionable to bash them as it is to wear them . " They are to your eyes what secondhand smoke is to your lungs , " says Vincenzo Ravina , whose www.ihatecrocs.com website features videos in which he and a friend take scissors and firecrackers to the shoes . YouTube is filled with similar fare . Keeping cool . If all that sounds like the kiss of fashion death  --  the Bush endorsement probably is n't a big plus  --  well , it would n't be the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anytime , for any reason , " says John Shanley , a senior analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group . Shanley ticks off now ignominious brand names like Jellies , Heelys , and L.A. Gear , the last of which went from hot to not almost overnight after Macy 's ran Sunday ads cutting their prices . " Within three weeks , retailers could n't give them away , " notes Shanley . The only way to avoid such a fate , he warns , " is to constantly reinvent your product . If you can do that , then you have a chance . " Crocs founders positioned the company to do just that . They first solicited another college buddy , Ron Snyder , to join their team as president in 2004 ( Snyder became CEO in 2005 ) . Snyder had run the design division at manufacturing giant Flextronics International , where he 'd helped churn out reinventions of everything from wristwatches to computer printers . He figured that the key to Crocs ' future growth was to give the product enough flexibility to adjust to consumers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which typically pre-sell their fall lines to retailers in the spring , then outsource production to Asia , Crocs makes approximately a third of its shoes in-house . The company retains its original Canadian factory , which it bought out in 2004 , and has added facilities in Canada , Mexico , and Brazil . The company takes preorders , but " if a particular style or color is hot , retailers can order more and we will deliver them while they 're still in season , " Snyder explains of shoes like the new fleece-lined Mammoth version . And if " the demand warrants it , " he adds , " we can make 10 times more than we originally anticipated . " Crocs also controls the secret recipe responsible for its shoes ' uniquely cushy feel . ( If you must know , it 's reportedly a cross-linked blend of Levirex-brand EVA copolymers , Dow Chemical 's Engage elastomer , and pigments , which are combined in differing proportions depending on the color and shoe size you want . ) Now trademarked under the name Croslite , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " because it 's actually quite hard to get it just right , " says Michelle Maniscalco , senior editor at Injection Molding Magazine , who has sleuthed out the basics of the recipe . " At least so far , the knockoffs out there just are n't as comfortable . " Brand extension . To further protect its turf , last year Crocs obtained patents on the ankle strap Seamans first used to make his prototype . The company also launched a series of lawsuits against copycats , winning settlements from a half-dozen competitors . " We 've created a new category of footwear , and we 're not fine with people who have infringed on the patents of our first shoes , " Snyder says . " But going forward , we 're about a lot more than just our original styles . " Indeed , while Crocs continues to crank out its ubiquitous Beach and Cayman styles , the company has quickly moved toward giving fashionistas less reason to whine . Last year , it acquired Italian footwear designer EXO Italia and quickly put its designers to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fancy flip-flops to 3-inch heels . Crocs also acquired sandal-makers Ocean Minded and Bite Footwear and incorporated the Croslite foot bed into their designs . Perhaps most noticeably , Crocs took on Jibbitz , maker of a line of wildly popular charms that fit into Crocs ' perforated holes . Buyers can now customize their Crocs shoes with everything from rhinestones to a growing collection of logos and characters . Crocs has licensed companies like Disney and Nickelodeon and numerous professional and college sports teams . The results so far are impressive . New products now make up about 75 percent of overall sales , which have doubled since the beginning of the year to $224 million in the past quarter . And with more shoe styles and a new clothing line on the way ( featuring a semistretchy blend of cotton and Croslite ) , " let 's just say we 're pretty comfortable with the direction we 're headed in , " Snyder says smugly . That is , as long as comfort does n't go out of fashion .
