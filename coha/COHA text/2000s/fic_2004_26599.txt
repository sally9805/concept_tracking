The Return of the Earl Chapter One England 1815 The visitor was late , but he would have been unwelcome at any hour . Nevertheless , a stableboy came running to greet his carriage as it rumbled up to the manor house as the first star appeared in a purpling evening sky . Many more eyes watched from behind curtains on the dozens of windows of the great house . The oaken front door swung open , the butler and his footmen stood in readiness . After a moment , a lean gentleman was seen in the doorway of the carriage . He bent his head , stepped out , and paused on the top of the little stair that had been let down . Straightening , he stood arrested , staring at the huge house , seeing the dark mass of it outlined by the last dim glow of sunset , punctuated by lights that twinkled in the dozens of windows facing the drive . It was too dusky for anyone to make out the expression on his face . He stepped down and headed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door rapidly and with easy grace , as though he had n't been confined in a rocking carriage for hours . " I believe I 'm expected ? " he asked the butler in a rich tenor voice , as he swept off his high beaver hat and caped coat and handed them to a footman . " I am Egremont . " The butler bowed , expressionless . " This way , sir , " he said . The gentleman hesitated . A thin eyebrow rose . " Sir ? " he echoed with cool amusement , slapping his gloves against his palm . " Maybe you did n't hear me . I am the new earl of Egremont . I 'd believed I was expected . " The butler 's expression did n't change , but his face grew ruddy . " Yes , sir , " he said . " You were indeed expected . As to the other matter , I was led to believe it was not yet settled , sir . " The gentleman laughed . " So it has n't been . I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as Sauvage then , if you must . Lead on . Oh , and I 'd like something to eat . Will you see to it ? It 's been a devilish long journey . " The butler bowed and led the gentleman into the front hall . The new arrival scarcely seemed to look at the house as he strode over the shining inlaid mosaic marble floors . He did n't pause to study the life-sized Grecian statues that lined the walls , or raise his eyes to the gilded domed ceiling of the great hall to see the rose-and-gold frescoes there . He had hardly a glance for the pair of separate twin staircases that wound their ways to the second level , where they met and embraced in a riot of carved acanthus leaves . He only followed the butler through the hall and down a corridor , seeming as cool and untouched by his surroundings as the servant who guided him . " You 're awaited in the red room , sir , " the butler murmured . He threw open a door to an enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red and brown settees and chairs . A massive fireplace with a leaping fire sparked reflections from the gilt edges on the furniture and many picture frames . But the fire only cast murky , ruddy shadows over the quartet of people there . " Mr. Sauvage , " the butler said , announcing him . The four people in the room stared . The visitor looked back at them serenely , only his eyes showing animation , glittering in the firelight as he surveyed them each in turn . He saw a stout middle-aged balding gentleman , the very model of a country squire , a young blond lady , delicate and perfectly dressed as a china figurine , an older woman , who was obviously her mama , and a square-faced , straw-haired , broad-shouldered young man . They goggled at him from out of the crimson shade . Their first impression was of a dark , elegantly dressed , extravagantly handsome young gentleman . The high planes on his smooth face were exaggerated by dancing firelight , making him look as though he 'd just stepped , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was impeccably clad in a close- fitting black jacket , with a white neckcloth , dark skintight breeches , and shining knee-high boots . The gentleman 's face was impassive . He had flawless skin , even features , and watchful eyes . The firelight made it impossible to make out the color of those wide , well-spaced eyes , but they were light , and shone with crystalline clarity . The most arresting thing about him was the cool expression on his smooth face . He looked as though no human emotion could touch him or ever had done . The middle-aged man leapt to his feet . " What is the meaning of this ? " he said . " You are not Geoffrey Sauvage ! " " No , I 'm not , " the gentleman said calmly . " Geoffrey Sauvage was my father . I am Christian Gabriel Peter Colinworth Sauvage , now the earl of Egremont , and master of this house . And you , sir ? You have me at a disadvantage . " The older man opened and closed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fair young man who rose to his feet and spoke . " I am Hammond Sauvage , " he said stiffly . " This is my fiance , Sophie Wiley , and her father , Squire Henry Wiley and his wife , Martha . You must understand that this is difficult for us to take in all at once . " Christian nodded . " Of course , I did n't expect you to believe me right away either , Cousin . You are my cousin , are n't you ? " Hammond nodded curtly . " But in time , you will believe me , " Christian said placidly . He moved toward the hearth . " I 've traveled a long way , and it 's cold out there . If you do n't mind , I 'd like a seat by the fire . " The squire flushed ...
