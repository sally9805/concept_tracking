The History Craze // History , and not necessarily the sort that professional historians are doing , is widely popular these days , even in North America , where we have tended to look toward the future rather than the past . It can be partly explained by market forces . People are better educated and , particularly in the mature economies , have more leisure time and are retiring from work earlier . Not everyone wants to retire to a compound in the sun and ride adult tricycles for amusement . History can be helpful in making sense of the world we live in . It can also be fascinating , even fun . How can even the best novelist or playwright invent someone like Augustus Caesar or Catherine the Great , Galileo or Florence Nightingale ? How can screenwriters create better action stories or human dramas than exist , thousand upon thousand , throughout the many centuries of recorded history ? There is a thirst out there both for knowledge and to be entertained , and the market has responded with enthusiasm . // Museums and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great or on specific periods in history . Around the world , new museums open every year to commemorate moments , often grim ones , from the past . China has museums devoted to Japanese atrocities committed during World War II . Washington , Jerusalem , and Montreal have Holocaust museums . Television has channels devoted entirely to history ( often , it must be said , showing a past that seems to be made up largely of battles and the biographies of generals ) ; historic sites are wilting under the tramp of tourists ; history movies  --  think of all the recent ones on Queen Elizabeth I alone  --  are making money ; and the proliferation of popular histories shows that publishers have a good idea of where profits are to be made . Ken Burns ? s documentaries , from the classic Civil War series to his one on World War II , are aired repeatedly . In Canada , Mark Starowicz ? s People ? s History drew millions of viewers . The Historica Minutes produced by the private foundation Historica , devoted to promoting Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often do school projects where they make their own minutes . In the United Kingdom , David Starkey ? s series on British monarchs have made him rich and as famous as the kings and queens themselves . // Many governments now have special departments devoted to commemorating the past  --  or , as it is often grandly designated , " heritage . " In Canada , the Department of Canadian Heritage exhorts Canadians to learn about Canada ? s history , culture , and land : " Heritage is our collective treasure , given to us and ours to bequeath to our children . " The term can encompass virtually anything : language , folk dances , recipes , antiques , paintings , customs , buildings . There are societies to celebrate antique cars or guns , baseball cards or matchboxes . In England , a young architect has founded the Chimneypot Preservation and Protection Society to save , as its mission decrees , " the Sentinels of Time . " // France , which has had a particularly active Ministry of Culture for decades , declared 1980 the Ann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great moments of their history . In the following years , the number of heritage sites and monuments on the official list doubled . Scores of new museums  --  devoted to the wooden shoe , for example , or the chestnut forest  --  appeared . At the end of the decade , the government set up a special commission to oversee the commemoration of the two-hundredth anniversary of the French Revolution in 1989. // In France there has been an explosion of reenactments of the past , festivals , and special months , weeks , and days . The possibilities , of course , are endless : the starts and ends of wars , the births and deaths of famous people , the first publication of a book or the first performance of an opera , a strike , a demonstration , a trial , a revolution , even natural disasters . And the activity is not all government inspired ; much comes from local and volunteer initiatives . Ch ? lons-sur-Marne recognized the centenary of the invention of canning . It is not just in France that communities want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week of festivities in 1993 to celebrate the giant cheese that it sent to the World ? s Fair in Chicago in 1893 . As enterprising local governments and businesses have realized , the past is also good for tourism . // Governments tend to assume that proper attention and care of the past will do the present good . In the United States , the National Historic Preservation Act assumes that a sense of the past will help make good Americans . The nation ? s heritage must be preserved , it says , " in order to give a sense of orientation to the American people . " President George W. Bush ? s executive order of 2003 titled " Preserve America " echoed that sentiment : " The Federal Government shall recognize and manage the historic properties in its ownership as assets that can support department and agency missions while contributing to the vitality and economic well-being of the Nation ? s communities and fostering a broader appreciation for the development of the United States and its underlying values . " // The passion for the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . History responds to a variety of needs , from greater understanding of ourselves and our world to answers about what to do . For many human beings , an interest in the past starts with themselves . That is in part a result of biology . Like other creatures , humans have a beginning and an ending , and in between lies their story . It probably also has to do with the realization that today the great majority of people live in a rapidly changing world where long-standing relationships that were once taken for granted  --  whether with places or with people such as family or friends  --  no longer exist for many . Part of the current fascination with preserving heritage comes from the fear that we are losing priceless and irreplaceable pieces of the past , whether they are dying languages or decaying buildings . Sometimes the preservationists seem to want time itself to stand still . In New York , to take a current debate , should the tenements of the Lower East Side be replaced by modern , more salubrious buildings ? Or should they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " to remind us of the experience lived and worked inside them " ? // Nineteen million people around the world are now signed up to the online Friends Reunited , which will put you in touch with long-lost friends from the distant past , even from your earliest school days . If anyone wants to go still further back , and an increasing number of people do , he or she can research genealogies . It is understandable , said a spokesman for the College of Arms in London , " in a throwaway society where everything is ephemeral . " Most national archives now have special sections set aside for patrons who are investigating their family histories . Thanks to the Mormons , who collect parish registers , genealogies , and birth records for their own purposes , Salt Lake City houses an enormous worldwide collection of records . The Internet has made it even easier , with dozens of sites where you can search for your ancestors , with more specialized ones dedicated to a single family name . In Canada and the United Kingdom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? caters to our fascination with celebrities and the hunt for ancestors as it traces back , often with surprising results , the family trees of the famous . // Recent developments in science make it possible to go beyond the printed records . The decoding of DNA means that scientists can now trace an individual ? s ancestry back through the mother ? s line and can find others with the same genetic makeup . As the databases of information build up , it becomes increasingly possible to see how human beings have migrated over the years . This is important for anyone who wants to go back beyond where the paper trail peters out . It is particularly important for those who never had much of a paper trail to begin with . Those immigrants who came in great waves to the New World in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to escape a miserable and uncertain life in Europe often lost all links with their pasts , sometimes indeed even their old names . For the descendants of American slaves , who lacked even the faintest hope of recovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more chance of finding out what happened to them once they were in the United States , DNA has suddenly opened the door to self-knowledge . A moving program called African American Lives , which was broadcast by PBS in 2006 , looked at the DNA of famous black Americans , Oprah Winfrey and Quincy Jones among them . Sometimes the results are disappointing : family stories about the great-grandparent who was descended from kings are often just that  --  stories . Sometimes there are surprises , as when an obscure professor of accounting in Florida found he was descended from Genghis Khan . Perhaps , thought the professor , he owed his administrative skills to his terrifying ancestor . // The current fascination for people ? s personal histories can be narcissistic  --  how much time should human beings spend gazing at themselves , after all ?  --  but it also comes from the desire to know more about what made people who they are and what made the world in which they happen to live . If people can stand back and see their own histories in a wider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products not just of particular individuals but of whole societies and cultures . Members of certain ethnic groups may find that they have inherited views on other ethnic groups , and may also find that others regard them in particular ways . History has shaped humans ? values , their fears , their aspirations , their loves , and their hatreds . When we start to realize that , we begin to understand something of the power of the past . // Even when people think they are striking out in new directions , their models often come from the past . How often have we seen revolutionaries , committed to building new worlds , slip back unconsciously into the habits and ways of those they have replaced ? Napoleon came to power as the result of the French Revolution , but the court he set up was modeled on that of the displaced Bourbons . The top Soviet Communists lived within the walls of the Kremlin , as the czars had once done . Stalin looked back to Ivan the Terrible and Peter the Great as his predecessors , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presi- dent . The Chinese Communists scorned China ? s traditional society , but their top leaders chose to live right at the heart of Beijing , where the imperial court had once been . Mao Zedong himself withdrew into mysterious seclusion , much as the emperors had done over the centuries . // " Men make their own history , " said Karl Marx , " but they do not make it as they please : they do not make it under self-selected circumstances , but under circumstances existing already , given and transmitted from the past . " // During the Cold War , though , history appeared to have lost much of its old power . The world that came into being after 1945 was divided up between two great alliance systems and two competing ideologies , both of which claimed to represent the future of humanity . American liberal capitalism and Soviet-style Communism were about , so they said , building new societies , per- haps even new human beings . The old conflicts , between Serbs and Croats , Germans and French , or Christians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leon Trotsky ? s memorable phrase , to the dustbin of history . The threat of massive nuclear war , of course , was always present , and from time to time , during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 , it looked as if the last moment of the planet had come . But it did not , and in the end most of us simply forgot about the danger . Nuclear weapons took on a benign aspect : after all , the balance of terror meant that neither superpower dared attack the other without risking its own destruction . People at the time assumed that the United States and the Soviet Union would remain locked in their conflict , between war and peace , perhaps forever . In the meantime , the developed world enjoyed unparalleled prosperity , and new economic powers , many in Asia , appeared on the scene . // My students used to tell me how lucky I was to be teaching history . Once you have got a period or the events of a war straight , so they assumed , you don ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so nice , they would say , not to redo your lecture notes . The past , after all , is the past . It can not be changed . History , they seemed to say , is no more demanding than digging a stone out of the ground . It can be fun to do but not really necessary . What does it matter what happened then ? This is now . // When the Cold War abruptly ended in 1989 with the collapse of the Soviet Empire in Europe , the world enjoyed a brief , much too brief , period of optimism . Collectively , it failed to recognize that the certainties of the post-1945 years had been replaced by a more complicated international order . Instead , most people assumed that as the remaining superpower , the United States would surely become a benevolent hegemon . Societies would benefit from a " peace dividend " because there would be no more need to spend huge amounts on the military . Liberal democracy had triumphed and Marxism itself had gone into the dustbin . History , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a contented , prosperous , and peaceful world was moving into the next millennium . // In fact , many of the old conflicts and tensions remained , frozen into place just under the surface of the Cold War . The end of that great struggle brought a thaw , and long-suppressed dreams and hatreds bubbled to the surface again . Saddam Hussein ? s Iraq invaded Kuwait , basing its claims on dubious history . We discovered that it mattered that Serbs and Croats had many historical reasons to fear and hate each other , and that there were peoples within the Soviet Union who had their own proud histories and who wanted their independence . Many of us had to learn who the Serbs and Croats were and where Armenia or Georgia lay on the map . In the words of the title of Misha Glenny ? s book on central Europe , we witnessed the rebirth of history . Of course , as so often happens , some people went too far the other way and blamed everything that was going wrong in the Balkans in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , on " age-old hatreds , " which conveniently overlooked the wickedness of Slobodan Milo ? evi ? c , ? then the president , and his ilk , who were doing their best to destroy Yugoslavia and dismember Bosnia . Such an attitude allowed outside powers to stand by wringing their hands helplessly for far too long . // The last two decades have been troubled and bewildering ones , and , not surprisingly , many people have turned to history to try to understand what is going on . Books on the history of the Balkans sold well as Yugoslavia fell to pieces . Today , publishers are rushing to commission histories of Iraq or to reissue older works . T. E. Lawrence ? s Seven Pillars of Wisdom , which describes the Arab struggle against Turkey for independence , is a bestseller again , and particularly popular with American soldiers serving in Iraq . My own book on the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 , where so much of the foundation of the modern world was laid , could not find a publisher in the 1980s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a bunch of dead white men sitting around talking about long-forgotten peace settlements . By the 1990s , the subject had come to seem a lot more relevant . // Today ? s world is far removed from the stasis of the Cold War . It looks more like that of the decade before 1914 and the outbreak of World War I or the world of the 1920s . In those days , as the British Empire started to weaken and other powers , from Germany to Japan to the United States , challenged it for hegemony , the international system became unstable . Today , the United States still towers over the other powers but not as much as it once did . It has been badly damaged by its in- volvement in Iraq , and it faces challenges from the rising Asian powers of China and India and its old rival Russia . Economic troubles bring , as they brought in the past , domestic pressures for protection and trade barriers . Ideologies  --  then Fascism and Communism , now religious fundamentalisms  --  challenge the assumptions of liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way . And the world still has , as it had in the first half of the twentieth century , the unreasoning forces of ethnic nationalism . //
