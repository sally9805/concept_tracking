Chapter Two The next morning Sarah sat at the breakfast table leafing through the newspaper and wishing that , like Matt , she needed to get ready for work . She heard him moving about upstairs , and from the noises coming through the wall she knew that some of the six undergraduates who rented the other half of the duplex were also preparing for the day . Each morning it seemed as if everyone but Sarah had a place to go , a place with people who needed them . " So instead you 'll sit here and whine . That 'll help , " she muttered . She sipped her coffee and turned the page , though she had n't read a word on it . Someone next door turned on the stereo , loud enough for the bass line to throb annoyingly at the edges of her perception but not so loud that Sarah could justify pounding on the wall . She knew from experience that the low drone would go on hiatus at noon , then resume somewhere between six-thirty and seven in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on weekends , but not by much . The noise probably would n't have bothered her if she were n't already in such a foul mood . Unemployment had stopped feeling like a vacation more than a month earlier , ever since she realized that few of the Waterford Register 's Help Wanted ads even remotely applied to her . And after eight weeks of unemployment , four unremarkable interviews , and more unanswered application letters than she could stomach , Sarah half feared she 'd never work again . Matt bounded down the stairs and into the room . He paused behind her chair to squeeze her shoulder before continuing on into the kitchen . " Anything ? " he called over the sound of coffee pouring into his travel mug . " Ield . She carried the newspaper and a fresh cup of coffee upstairs to the small second bedroom they used as an office . Maybe she should adopt Matt 's philosophy . Maybe all it took was hard work and a bit of luck . If she stuck with it , she 'd surely find a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunt disk sat next to the computer , where she had left it the last time she worked on her rsum . She made a few revisions , printed out a couple of copies , then showered and dressed . Within an hour she was waiting at the bus stop for a ride downtown . Waterford , Pennsylvania , was a town of about 35,000 people , except when Waterford College was in session and the population rose by 15,000 young adults . The downtown bordered the campus , and , aside from a few city government offices , consisted mainly of bars , faddish restaurants , and shops catering to the students . The local residents knew they owed their livelihoods to the transient student population , and although they were grateful for the income , many resented the dependence . Sometimes the town 's collective resentment erupted in a flurry of housing and noise ordinances , and the students would strike back with boycotts and sarcastic editorials in the school newspaper . Sarah was n't sure which group she sided with . The students treated her like a suspicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a despicable student . She tried to compensate by being polite to everyone , even their rowdy neighbors and the occasional shopkeeper who eyed her as if she might make off with half of the inventory , but it did n't seem to help . She got off at the stop closest to the post office , carrying her job application materials i n her backpack . The day was humid and overcast . She scanned the gray clouds and quickened her pace . In the past few weeks she had learned the hard way that summer rainstorms in her new hometown were as brief and drenching as they were sudden . She would have to hurry if she wanted to stop at the market and catch the bus home without getting soaked . The errand at the post office took only a few minutes , and after picking up some groceries , Sarah still had ten minutes until the next bus would arrive . She strolled down the street to the bus stop , window-shopping and listening for thunder . When a patch of bright colors caught her eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widened in admiration as she studied the red-and-green quilt hanging in the shop window . Eight identical diamonds , each composed of sixteen smaller diamonds , formed a large , eight-pointed star . The arrangement of colors created the illusion that the star radiated outward from its center . Between the points of the star , tiny stitches created intricate wreaths in the background fabric . Something about the quilt seemed familiar , and then she remembered why ; its pattern was similar to the quilt she had seen the day before in Mrs. Compson 's sitting room . Studying it , Sarah wished she knew how to make something so beautiful . She had always loved quilts , loved the feel of the fabric and the way a quilt could make color blossom over a bed or on a wall . She could n't see a quilt without thinking of her grandmother and without feeling a painful blend of love and loss . When Sarah was a child , her family made the long drive to Grandma 's small house in Michigan 's Upper Peninsula only twice a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ter visits were best . They would bundle up on the sofa under two or three of Grandma 's old quilts , munch cookies , sip hot chocolate , and watch through the window as snow blanketed the earth . Some of Grandma 's creations still decorated Sarah 's childhood home , but Sarah could n't remember ever seeing her mother so much as touch a needle . If quiltmaking was a skill handed down from mother to daughter , her mother must have been the weak link in the chain . Grandma surely would have taught her if she had wanted to learn . Sarah looked overhead for the sign bearing the shop 's name , and laughed in surprise when she saw the words Grandma 's Attic printed in gold letters on a red background . She checked her watch , gave the bus stop one last quick glance , and entered the shop . Shelves stacked high with bolts of fabric , thread , notions , and other gadgets lined the walls and covered most of the floor . Celtic folk music played in the background . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughing around a large cutting table . One looked up from the conversation to smile at her , and Sarah smiled back . She made her way around the checkout counter to the front window and discovered that the quilt was even more beautiful up close . She tried to estimate how the quilt would fit their bed . " I see our Lone Star charmed another new visitor inside , " a pleasant voice broke in on her thoughts . Sarah turned and found the woman who had smiled at her standing at her elbow . She looked to be in her mid-fifties , with dark , close-cropped hair , ruddy skin , and a friendly expression . " Is that what it 's called , a Lone Star ? It 's beautiful . " The woman casually brushed pieces of thread from her sleeve as she join ed Sarah in admiring the quilt . " Oh , yes , it 's lovely , is n't it ? Wish I could take the credit , but one of our local quilt artists made it . It 's queen-sized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it ? " " Seven hundred and fifty dollars . " " Thanks anyway , " Sarah said , not entirely able to keep the disappointment out of her voice . The woman smiled in sympathy . " I know  --  it 's a lot , is n't it ? Actually , though , if you took that price and calculated an hourly wage from it , you 'd see that it 's a bargain . " " I can believe that . It must 've taken years to make . " " Most people stop by , hear the price , then head straight to some discount store for a cheap knockoff . " The woman sighed and shook her head . " People who do n't know quilts ca n't detect the obvious differences in quality of materials and workmanship . Mrs. Compson 's lucky to get what she can for those she displays here . " " Mrs. Compson ? " " Yes , Sylvia Compson . She 's been staying up at Elm Creek Manor since her sister died two months ago . Temperamental as hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd agree to display her quilts in the window . She 's right , of course . I 'd hate to have one of her pieces fade from the sunlight . She has two quilts in the American Quilter 's Society 's permanent collection in Paducah . " " That 's good , right ? " " Good ? I 'd be glad just to have something accepted in the AQS annual show . " The woman chuckled . " I thought every quilter around here knew about Sylvia Compson . " " I 've met Mrs. Compson , but I 'm not a quilter . I do love quilts , though . " " Is that so ? You should learn how to quilt , then . " " Watch out , everyone , Bonnie 's about to make another convert , " one of the women called out from the cu tting table . " Run for it , honey , " another warned , and they all burst out laughing . Bonnie joined in . " Okay , I admit I have a vested interest . Satisfied ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Sarah . " We do offer lessons , um ... ? " " Sarah . Are you the Grandma from the sign ? " " Oh , no , " Bonnie said , laughing . " Not yet at least , thank God , although I do get asked that a lot . There 's no Grandma . There 's no attic , either . I just liked the name . Kind of homey , do n't you think ? As you already heard , my name 's Bonnie , and these are some of my friends , the Tangled Web Quilters . We 're sort of a renegade group separate from the local Waterford Quilting Guild . We take our quilting  --  and ourselves  --  very seriously . " Her tone suggested that the remark was only half true . She handed Sarah a photocopied calendar . " Here 's a schedule if you 're interested in the lessons . Is there anything else I can help you with ? " Sarah shook her head . " Well , thanks for stopping by . Come back anytime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get back to that crowd before Diane hides my rotary cutter again . " She smiled and returned to the cutting table . " Thanks , " Sarah answered , folding up the paper and tucking it into her backpack . She left the store , ran half a block to the bus stop , and climbed on the bus just as heavy drops of rain began to pelt the sidewalk .
