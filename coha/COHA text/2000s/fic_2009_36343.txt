Hope Dunne made her way through the silently falling snow on Prince Street in SoHo in New York . It was seven o'clock , the shops had just closed , and the usual bustle of commerce was shutting down for the night . She had lived there for two years and she liked it . It was the trendy part of New York , and she found it friendlier than living uptown . SoHo was full of young people , there was always something to see , someone to talk to , a bustle of activity whenever she left her loft , which was her refuge . There were bright lights in all the shops . <br> It was her least favorite time of year , December , the week before Christmas . As she had for the past several years , she ignored it , and waited for it to pass . For the past two Christmases , she had worked at a homeless shelter . The year before that she had been in India , where the holiday did n't matter . It had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Everything seemed so commercial and superficial in comparison . <br> The time she had spent in India had changed her life , and probably saved it . She had left on the spur of the moment , and been gone for over six months . Reentry into American life had been incredibly hard . Everything she owned was in storage and she had moved from Boston to New York . It did n't really matter to her where she lived , she was a photographer and took her work with her . The photographs she had taken in India and Tibet were currently being shown in a prestigious gallery uptown . Some of her other work was in museums . People compared her work to that of Diane Arbus . She had a fascination with the destitute and devastated . The agony in the eyes of some of her subjects ripped out your soul , just as it had affected hers when she photographed them . Hope 's work was greatly respected , but to look at her , nothing about her demeanor suggested that she was famous or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an observer , a chronicler of the human condition . And in order to do that , she had always said , one had to be able to disappear , to become invisible , so as not to interfere with the mood of the subject . The studies she had done in India and Tibet for the magical time she was there had confirmed it . In many ways , Hope Dunne was an almost invisible person , in other ways , she was enormous , with an inner light and strength that seemed to fill a room . <br> She smiled at a woman passing by , as she walked through the snow on Prince Street . She was tempted to go for a long walk in the snow , and promised herself she might do that later that evening . She lived on no particular schedule , answered to no one . One of the blessings of her solitary life was that she was entirely at liberty to do whatever she wished . She was the consummate independent woman , she was enormously disciplined about her work , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subway , and rode uptown to Harlem , wandering through the streets in T-shirt and jeans , taking photographs of children . She had spent time in South America , photographing children and old people there too . She went wherever the spirit moved her , and did very little commercial work now . She still did the occasional fashion shoot for Vogue if the layout was unusual . But most of the magazine work she did was portraits of important people who she thought were worthwhile and interesting . She had published a remarkable book of portraits , another of children , and was going to publish a book of her photographs from India soon . <br> She was fortunate to be able to do whatever she wanted . She could pick and choose among the many requests she got . Although she loved doing them , she only did formal portraits now once or twice a year . More often now , she concentrated on the photographs she took in the course of her travels or on the street . <br> Hope was a tiny woman with porcelain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teased her when she was a child and said she looked like Snow White , which in a way , she did . And there was a fairy-tale feeling about her too . She was almost elfin in size , and unusually lithe ; she was able to fit herself into the smallest , most invisible spaces and go unnoticed . The only startling thing about her was her deep violet eyes . They were a deep , deep blue , with the slightly purple color of very fine sapphires from Burma or Ceylon , and were filled with compassion that had seen the sorrows of the world . Those who had seen eyes like hers before understood instantly that she was a woman who had suffered , but wore it well , with dignity and grace . Rather than dragging her down into depression , her pain had lifted her into a peaceful place . She was not a Buddhist , but shared philosophies with them , in that she did n't fight what happened to her , but instead drifted with it , allowing life to carry her from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wisdom that shone through her work . An acceptance of life as it really was , rather than trying to force it to be what one wanted , and it never could be . She was willing to let go of what she loved , which was the hardest task of all . And the more she lived and learned and studied , the humbler she was . A monk she had met in Tibet called her a holy woman , which in fact she was , although she had no particular affinity for any formal church . If she believed in anything , she believed in life , and embraced it with a gentle touch . She was a strong reed bending in the wind , beautiful and resilient . <br> It was snowing harder by the time she got to the front door of her building . She was carrying a camera case over her shoulder , and her keys and wallet were in it . She carried nothing else , and she wore no makeup , except very occasionally bright red lipstick when she went out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And she wore her almost blue-black hair pulled straight back , either in a ponytail , a braid , or a chignon , and when she loosened it , it hung to her waist . Her graceful movements made her look like a young girl , and she had almost no lines on her face . Her biography as a photographer said that she was forty-four years old , but it was difficult to assess her age and it would have been easy to believe she was far younger . Like the photographs she took , and her subjects , she was timeless . Looking at her , one wanted to stop and watch her for a long time . She rarely wore color , and dressed almost always in black , so as not to distract her subjects , or in white in hot climates . <br> Once she unlocked the front door to her building , she bounded up to the third floor with a quick step . She was cold , and happy to walk into her apartment , which was considerably warmer than it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind crept through the tall windows . <br> She turned on the lights , and took pleasure , as she always did , in the spartan decor . The cement floor was painted black , the white couches and inviting chairs were a soft ivory wool , and nothing about the decor was intrusive . It was so simple it was almost Zen . And the walls were covered with enormous framed black and white photographs that were her favorites among her work . The longest wall was covered with a spectacular series of a young ballerina in motion . The girl in the photographs was exceptionally beautiful , a graceful young blond dancer in her teens . It was a remarkable series , and part of Hope 's personal collection . On the other walls were many photographs of children , several of monks in India at the ashram where she had lived , and two enormous ones of heads of state . <br> Her loft was like a gallery of her work , and on one long white lacquer table , set on sponge-covered trays , all of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired freelance assistants when she did assignments , but most of the time she preferred to do all her own work . She found assistants helpful , but too distracting . Her favorite camera was an old Leica she had had for years . She used a Hasselblad and Mamiya in the studio as well , but she still loved her oldest camera best . She had started taking photographs when she was nine . She had attended a specially designed photography program at Brown at seventeen , and graduated at twenty-one with honors , after doing a spectacular senior project in the Middle East . She had worked for a year as a commercial photographer after she graduated , and then retired for a dozen years , with only the occasional very rare assignment , when she married shortly after graduating from Brown . She had been back at work for the last ten years , and it was in the past decade that she had made her mark in the world and become increasingly well known . She had been famous by the time she was thirty-eight , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had been one of the high points of her life . <br> Hope lit candles around the room and left the lights in the loft dim . Coming home to this room always soothed her . She slept on a little platform , up a ladder , on a spare narrow bed , and loved looking down at the room and the feeling of flying as she fell asleep . The loft was completely different from anywhere she had ever lived , and she loved that about it too . Because she had always feared it so much , this time she had embraced change . There was something powerful about accepting what frightened her most . Her private nemeses were loss and change , and rather than running from them , she had learned to face them with dignity and strength . <br> There was a small black granite kitchen at the back of the loft . She knew she had to eat , so eventually she wound up there , and heated up a can of soup . Most of the time , she was too lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soups and salads and eggs . On the rare occasions when she wanted a real meal , she went to some simple restaurant alone and ate quickly , to get it over with . She had never been much of a cook , and made no pretense of it . It had always seemed like a waste of time to her , there were so many other things that interested her more  --  previously , her family , and now , her work . In the past three years , her work had become her life . She put her whole soul into it and it showed . <br> Hope was eating her soup , watching the snow fall outside , when her cell phone rang , and she set the soup down , and dug the phone out of her camera bag . She was n't expecting any calls , and smiled when she heard the familiar voice of her agent , Mark Webber . She had n't heard from him in a while . <br> " Okay , so where are you now ? And what time zone are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She laughed in response , and sat back against the couch with a smile . He had represented her for the last ten years , when she went back to work . He usually tried to push her to do commercial jobs , but he also had a deep respect for her more serious artistic endeavors . He always said that one day she would be one of the most important American photographers of her generation , and in many ways she already was , and was deeply respected by both curators and her peers . <br> " I 'm in New York , " she said , smiling . " And you 're not waking me up . " <br> " I 'm disappointed . I figured you were in Nepal , or Vietnam , or someplace scary and disgusting . I 'm surprised you 're here . " He knew how much she hated holidays , and all the reasons why . She had good reason . But she was a remarkable woman  --  a survivor  --  and a dear friend . He liked and admired her enormously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . I was sitting here watching the snow . It 's pretty . I might go out and shoot for a bit later . Some nice old-fashioned stuff . " <br> " It 's freezing out , " he warned her . " Do n't catch cold . " He was one of the few people who worried about her , and she was touched by his concern . She had moved around too much in recent years to stay in contact with her old friends . She had lived in Boston since college , but when she got back from India , she decided to move to New York . Hope had always been a solitary person , and was even more so now . It concerned him , but she seemed content with her life as it was . <br> " I just got in , " she reassured him , " and I was having some chicken soup . " <br> " My grandmother would approve , " he said , smiling again . " So what do you have planned at the moment ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come through him . <br> " Nothing much . I was thinking about going up to the house in Cape Cod over the holiday . It 's pretty there this time of year . " <br> " How cheerful . Only you would think it 's pretty . Everyone else would get suicidal there this time of year . I have a better idea . " He had on his " have I got a deal for you " voice , and she laughed . She knew him well and liked him too . <br> " Like what ? What crazy assignment are you going to try and talk me into now , Mark ? Las Vegas on Christmas Eve ? " They both laughed at the prospect of it . Occasionally he came up with some wild ideas , which she almost always turned down . But at least he had to try . He always promised the potential clients he would . <br> " No , although Vegas for the holidays sounds like fun to me . " They both knew he loved to gamble and took occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is actually respectable and quite dignified . We got a call from a major publishing house today . Their star author wants a portrait sitting for his latest book cover . He has n't delivered the book yet , but he will any minute , and the publisher needs the shot done now for their catalog and layouts for advance publicity in the trade . It 's all very proper and on the up and up . The only problem is that they have a tight deadline . They should have thought of it before . " <br> " How tight ? " Hope asked , sounding noncommittal , and stretching out on the white wool couch as she listened . <br> " They need to do the shoot by next week , for their production schedule . That means you 'd be shooting around Christmas , but he requested you , and said he wo n't do it with anyone else . At least the guy 's got good taste . And the fee is pretty hefty . He 's a big deal . " <br> " Who 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision , and her agent hesitated before he said the name . He was an important author , had won the National Book Award , and was always at the top of the best-seller lists , but he was a bit of a wild card , and had appeared in the press frequently with assorted women . Mark did n't know how Hope would feel about shooting him , particularly if he misbehaved , and he could . There were no guarantees that he would n't . She usually preferred to work with serious subjects . <br> " Finn O'Neill , " he said , without further comment , waiting to see what she 'd say . He did n't want to influence her or discourage her . It was entirely up to her , and it would be perfectly reasonable if they declined since it was on short notice , and Christmas week . <br> Continues ...
