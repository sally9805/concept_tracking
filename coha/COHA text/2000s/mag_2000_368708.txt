Ralph Nader is eating a banana  --  organic , naturally  --  in a Cadillac in Cleveland , Ohio . Usually , his staff rents a mere midsize car for him when he travels , but when the folks at the rental counter heard it was Ralph Nader who 'd be tooling around in their vehicle , they offered an upgrade . This is a rare indulgence , though , in this shoe-string campaign . Nader has no motorcade , no private jet . He travels with just one staff member , flies coach and looks more like a rumpled academic than a presidential candidate . <P> For years the consumer activist never dived into electoral politics . Now the man whose 1965 auto-industry polemic , Unsafe at Any Speed , brought us mandatory seat belts is on a collision course with Al Gore . In the Bush-Gore race , Nader could throw the election to Bush by draining liberal votes from Gore . Even though Nader polls just 3% of likely voters nationally , according to the latest TIME/CNN poll , he runs much stronger in Oregon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Nader 's supporters are enthusiastic : he has drawn crowds of 10,000 and more in Boston and Portland , Ore . He sold out New York City 's Madison Square Garden , and he has more such superrallies planned in California and Wisconsin . Savoring his newfound success in electoral politics , Nader told TIME , " I should have done it sooner . " <P> What 's the appeal ? Well , he 's not Bush or Gore . In a race short on enthusiasm for two Ivy League centrists , the Ivy League radical ( Princeton , Harvard Law ) has panache . Plus there 's nothing poll-tested about him . He does n't do focus groups . At 66 , he 's a generation older than boomers Bush and Gore , but he 's tapped into youthful idealism . A bit of a recluse , he does n't own a car and is known for his old clothes , even though his speaking fees and investments have left him with personal assets of close to $4 million . But the key to Nader 's clout is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the globalization initiatives of Bill Clinton . Nader lashes out at the World Trade Organization and the recent passage of Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China . Such agreements , he charges , betray workers here and abroad by ignoring labor and environmental standards . Indeed , several Nader-founded groups helped lead last year 's demonstrations against the WTO in Seattle . <P> All this has left the Gore campaign wondering how to lure Nader voters . Its answer has been to have surrogates like Gloria Steinem and Jesse Jackson argue that a vote for Nader is a vote for Bush . " I make the case wherever I can that I need a partner at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue , " says Representative Tammy Baldwin , a Democrat who represents Madison , Wis . The National Abortion Rights Action League has sponsored TV ads urging Nader voters to " consider the risk , " lest they elect Bush and tip the Supreme Court against legal abortion . The strategy could backfire by drawing even more attention to Nader . For Team Bush , the best response has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , the Republican Leadership Council , however , is running ads with footage of Nader bashing Gore for " promises broken . "
