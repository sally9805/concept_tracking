Chapter One The tall and dour non-com wore Imperial dress greens and carried his communications panel like a field marshall 's baton . He slapped it absently against his thigh and raked the group of young men before him with a gaze of dry contempt . Challenging . All part of the game , Miles told himself . He stood in the crisp autumn breeze and tried not to shiver in his shorts and running shoes . Nothing to put you off balance like being nearly naked when all about you look ready for one of Emperor Gregor 's reviews-although , in all fairness , the majority here were dressed the same as himself . The noncom proctoring the tests merely seemed like a one-man crowd . Miles measured him , wondering what conscious or unconscious tricks of body language he used to achieve that air of icy competence . Something to be learned there ... " You will run in pairs , " the non-com instructed . He did not seem to raise his voice , but somehow it was pitched to carry to the ends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it reminded him of that habit of his father 's , of dropping his voice to a whisper when speaking in a rage . It locked attention . " The timing of the five-kilometer run begins immediately upon completion of the last phase of the obstacle course ; remember it . " The non-com began counting off pairs . The eliminations for officers ' candidacy in the Barrayaran Imperial Military Service took a grueling week . Five days of written and oral examinations were behind Miles now . The hardest part was over , everybody said . There was almost an air of relaxation among the young men around him . There was more talking and joking in the group , exaggerated complaints about the difficulty of the exams , the withering wit of the examining officers , the poor food , interrupted sleep , surprise distractions during the testing . Self-congratulatory complaints , these , among the survivors . They looked forward to the physical tests as a game . Recess , perhaps . The hardest part was over-for everyone but Miles . He stood to his full height , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pull his crooked spine out straight by force of will . He gave a little upward jerk of his chin , as if balancing his too-large head , a head meant for a man over six feet , on his just-under-five-foot frame , and narrowed his eyes at the obstacle course . It began with a concrete wall , five meters high , topped with iron spikes . Climbing it would be no problem , there was nothing wrong with his muscles , it was the coming down that worried him . The bones , always the damn bones ... " Kosigan , Kostolitz , " the noncom called , passing in front of him . Miles 's brows snapped down and he gave the non-com a sharp upward glance , then controlled his gaze to a blank straightness . The omission of the honorific before his name was policy , not insult . All classes stood equal in the Emperor 's service now . A good policy . His own father endorsed it . Grandfather bitched , to be sure , but that unreconstructed old man had begun his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each officer trained his own military apprentices . To have addressed him in those days as Kosigan , without the Vor , might have resulted in a duel . Now his grandson sought entrance to a military academy , off planet style , and training in the tactics of energy weapons , wormhole exits , and planetary defense . And stood shoulder to shoulder with boys who would not have been permitted to polish his sword in the old days . Not quite shoulder to shoulder , Miles reflected dryly , stealing a sidelong glance up at the candidates on either side of him . The one he had been paired with for the obstacle course , what 's his name , Kostolitz , caught the glance and looked back down with ill-concealed curiosity . Miles 's eye level gave him a fine opportunity to study the fellow 's excellent biceps . The non-com signalled fall out for those not running the obstacle course immediately . Miles and his companion sat on the ground . " I 've been seeing you around all week , " offered Kostolitz . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miles controlled his irritation with the ease of long practice . God knew he did stand out in a crowd , particularly this crowd . At least Kostolitz did not make hex signs at him , like a certain decrepit old countrywoman down at Vorkosigan Surleau . In some of the more remote and undeveloped regions on Barrayar , such as deep in the Dendarii Mountains in the Vorkosigans ' own district , infanticide was still practiced for defects as mild as a harelip , despite sporadic efforts from the more enlightened centers of authority to stamp it out . He glanced down at the pair of gleaming metal rods paralleling his left leg between knee and ankle that had remained secretly beneath his trouser leg until this day . " Leg brace , " he replied , polite but unencouraging . Kostolitz continued to stare . " What for ? " " Temporary . I have a couple of brittle bones there . Keeps me from breaking them , until the surgeon 's quite sure I 'm done growing . Then I get them replaced with synthetics . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a disease , or what ? " Under the guise of shifting his weight , he moved just slightly farther from Miles . Unclean , unclean , thought Miles wildly ; should I ring a bell ? I ought to tell him it 's contagious-I was six-foot-four this time last year ... He sighed away the temptation . " My mother was exposed to a poison gas when she was pregnant with me . She pulled through all right , but it wrecked my bone growth . " " Huh . Did n't they give you any medical treatment ? " " Oh , sure . I 've had an Inquisition 's worth . That 's why I can walk around today , instead of being carried in a bucket . " Kostolitz looked mildly revolted , but stopped trying to sidle subtly upwind . " How did you ever get past the medicals ? I thought there was a minimum height rule . " " It was waived , pending my test results . " " Oh . " Kostolitz digested this . Miles returned his attention to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time on that belly-crawl under the laser fire ; good , he would need it on the five-kilometer run . Lack of height , and a permanent limp from a left leg shorter , after more fractures than he could remember , by a good four centimeters than his right , would slow him down . No help for it . Tomorrow would be better ; tomorrow was the endurance phase . The herd of long-legged gangling boys around him could unquestionably beat him on the sprint . He fully expected to be anchor man on the first 25-kilometer leg tomorrow , probably the second as well , but after 75 kilometers most would be flagging as the real pain mounted . I am a professional of pain , Kostolitz , he thought to his rival . Tomorrow , after about kilometer 100 , I 'll ask you to repeat those questions of yours-if you have the breath to spare .... Bloody hell , let 's pay attention to business , not this dink . A five-meter drop-perhaps it would be better to go around , take a zero on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be relatively poor . He hated to part with a single point unnecessarily , and at the very beginning , too . He was going to need every one of them . Skipping the wall would cut into his narrow safety margin- " You really expect to pass the physicals ? " asked Kostolitz , looking around . " I mean , above the 50th percentile ? " " No . " Kostolitz looked baffled . " Then what the hell 's the point ? " " I do n't have to pass it ; just make something near a decent score . " Kostolitz 's eyebrows rose . " Whose ass do you have to kiss to get a deal like that ? Gregor Vorbarra 's ? " There was an undercurrent of incipient jealousy in his tone , class-conscious suspicion . Miles 's jaw clamped . Let us not bring up the subject of fathers ... " How do you plan to get in without passing ? " Kostolitz persisted , eyes narrowing . His nostrils flared at the scent of privilege , like an animal alert for blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be in your blood , like war . " I petitioned , " Miles explained patiently , " to have my scores averaged instead of taken separately . I expect my writtens to bring up my physicals . " " That far up ? You 'd need a damn near perfect score ! " " That 's right , " Miles snarled . " Kosigan , Kostolitz , " another uniformed proctor called . They entered the starting area . " It 's a little hard on me , you know , " Kostolitz complained . " Why ? It has n't got a thing to do with you . None of your business at all , " Miles added pointedly . " We 're put in pairs to pace each other . How will I know how I 'm doing ? " " Oh , do n't feel you have to keep up with me , " Miles purred . Kostolitz 's brows lowered with annoyance . They were chivvied into place . Miles glanced across the parade ground at a distant knot of men waiting and watching ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handful of Counts ' sons present today . There was a pair of hard-looking men in the blue and gold of the Vorpatrils ; his cousin Ivan must be around here somewhere . And there was Bothari , tall as a mountain and lean as a knife , in the brown and silver of the Vorkosigans . Miles raised his chin in a barely perceptible salute . Bothari , 100 meters away , caught the gesture and changed his stance from at ease to a silent parade rest in acknowledgment . A couple of testing officers , the noncom , and a pair of proctors from the course were huddled together at a distance . Some gesticulations , a look in Miles 's direction ; a debate , it seemed . It concluded . The proctors returned to their stations , one of the officers started the next pair of boys over the course , and the noncom approached Miles and his companion . He looked uneasy . Miles schooled his features to cool attention . " Kosigan , " the noncom began , voice carefully neutral . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Artificial aids not permitted for the test . " A dozen counter-arguments sprang up in Miles 's mind . He tightened his lips on them . This noncom was in a sense his commanding officer ; Miles knew for certain that more than physical performance was being evaluated today . " Yes , sir . " The noncom looked faintly relieved . " May I give it to my man ? " asked Miles . He threatened the noncom with his eyes-if not , I 'm going to stick you with it , and you 'll have to cart it around the rest of the day-see how conspicuous it makes you feel ... " Certainly , sir , " said the noncom . The " sir " was a slip ; the non-com knew who he was , of course . A small wolfish smile slid across Miles 's mouth , and vanished . Miles gave Bothari a high sign , and the liveried bodyguard trotted over obediently . " You may not converse with him , " the noncom warned . " Yes , sir , " acknowledged Miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparatus . Good ; a kilo less to carry . He tossed it up to Bothari , who caught it one-handed , and squirmed back to his feet . Bothari , correctly , offered him no hand up . Seeing his bodyguard and the noncom together , the noncom suddenly bothered Miles less . The proctor looked shorter , somehow , and younger ; even a little soft . Bothari was taller , leaner , much older , a lot uglier , and considerably meaner-looking . But then , Bothari had been a noncom himself when this proctor had been a toddler . Narrow jaw , hooked beak of a nose , eyes of a nondescript color set too close together ; Miles looked up at his liveried retainer 's face with a loving pride of possession . He glanced toward the obstacle course and let his eyes pass over Bothari 's . Bothari glanced at it too , pursed his lips , tucked the brace firmly under his arm , and gave a slight shake of his head directed , apparently , at the middle distance . Miles 's mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting area . So Bothari advised caution . But then , Bothari 's job was to keep him intact , not advance his career-no , unfair , Miles chided himself . No one had been of more service in the preparations for this frantic week than Bothari . He 'd spent endless time on training , pushing Miles 's body to its too-soon-found limits , unflaggingly devoted to his charge 's passionate obsession . My first command , thought Miles . My private army . Kostolitz stared after Bothari . He identified the livery at last , it seemed , for he looked back at Miles in startled illumination . " So , that 's who you are , " he said , with a jealous awe . " No wonder you got a deal on the tests . " Miles smiled tightly at the implied insult . The tension crawled up his back . He groped for some suitably scathing retort , but they were being motioned to the starting mark . Kostolitz 's deductive faculty crunched on , it seemed , for he added sardonically , " And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Imperium ! " " Time mark , " said the proctor , " now ! " And they were off . Kostolitz sprinted ahead of Miles instantly . You 'd better run , you witless bastard , because if I can catch you , I 'm going to kill you-Miles galloped after him , feeling like a cow in a horse race . The wall , the bloody wall-Kostolitz was grunting halfway up it when Miles arrived . At least he could show this working-class hero how to climb . He swarmed up it as if the tiny toe and finger holds were great steps , his muscles powered-over-powered-by his fury . To his satisfaction , he reached the top ahead of Kostolitz . He looked down , and stopped abruptly , perched gingerly among the spikes . The proctor was watching closely . Kostolitz caught up with Miles , his face suffused with effort . " A Vor , scared of heights ? " Kostolitz gasped , with a grinning glare over his shoulder . He flung himself off , hit the sand with an authoritative impact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be wasted climbing down like some arthritic little old lady-perhaps if he hit the ground rolling-the proctor was staring-Kostolitz had already reached the next obstacle-Miles jumped . Time seemed to stretch itself , as he plummeted toward the sand , especially to allow him the full sick savor of his mistake . He hit the sand with the familiar shattering crack . And sat , blinking stupidly at the pain . He would not cry out-at least , the detached observer in the back of his brain commented sardonically , you ca n't blame it on the brace-this time you 've managed to break both of them . His legs began to swell and discolor , mottled white and flushed . He pulled himself along until they were stretched out straight , and bent over a moment , hiding his face in his knees . Face buried , he permitted himself one silent rictus scream . He did not swear . The vilest terms he knew seemed wholly inadequate to the occasion . The proctor , awakening to the fact that he was not going to stand up , started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the path of the next pair of candidates , and waited patiently for Bothari .
