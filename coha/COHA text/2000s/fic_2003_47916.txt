War and Peace <p> EVENTUALLY IT CAME TO PASS that no one ever had to die , unless they wanted to , or could be talked into it . That made it very hard to fight wars , and a larger and larger part of every nation 's military budget was given over to psychological operations directed toward their own people : dulce et decorum est just was n't convincing enough anymore . <p> There were two elements to this sales job . One was to romanticize the image of the soldier as heroic defender of the blah blah blah . That was not too hard ; they 'd been doing that since Homer . The other was more subtle : convince people that every individual life was essentially worthless - your own and also the lives of the people you would eventually be killing . <p> That was a hard job , but the science of advertising , more than a millennium after Madison Avenue , was equal to it , through the person of a genius named Manny O'Malley . The pitch was subtle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for centuries , but shorn of Manny 's incomprehensible humor and appeal to subtle pleasures that had no name until the thirtieth century , it boiled down to this : <p> A thousand years ago , they seduced people into soldiering with the slogan , " Be all that you can be . " But you have been all you can be . The only thing left worth being is not being . <p> Everybody else is in the same boat , O'Malley convinced them . In the process of giving yourself the precious gift of nonexistence , share it with many others . <p> It 's hard for us to understand . But then we would be hard for them to understand , with all this remorseless getting and spending laying waste our years . <p> Wars were all fought in Death Valley , with primitive hand weapons , and the United States grew wealthy renting the place out , until it inevitably found itself fighting a series of wars for Death Valley , during one of which O'Malley himself finally died , charging a phalanx of no-longer-immortal pikemen on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final words were , famously , " Oh , shit . " <p> Death Valley eventually wound up in the hands of the Bertelsmann Corporation , which ultimately ruled the world . But by that time , Manny 's advertising had been so effective that no one cared . Everybody was in uniform , lining up to do their bit for Bertelsmann . <p> Even the advertising scientists . Even the high management of Bertelsmann . <p> There was a worldwide referendum , utilizing something indistinguishable from telepathy , where everybody agreed to change the name of the planet to Death Valley , and on the eve of the new century , A.D. 3000 , have at each other . <p> Thus O'Malley 's ultimate ad campaign achieved the ultimate victory : a world that consumed itself . <p>
