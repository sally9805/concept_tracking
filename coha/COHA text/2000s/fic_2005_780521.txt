His dark eyes behind thin glasses watch the shallow stream of water which flows into the tunnel . <p> # THE WATER # <p> not more than six inches deep . Just beneath the surface a young woman 's pale blue arm in gaudy bracelets bats against the edge of her body like a docked boat .

Brendan goes to the phone and puts the receiver to his ear . Silence for a moment , then a thin female voice from the phone . <p> 1 Originally Dode was later revealed to have been hiding above the tunnel . 2 The street names were changed in production to match existing streets ( we couldn ! t afford to create custom street signs . ) <p> 2 <p> # VOICE # ( over phone ) Brendan ? <p> # BRENDAN # Emily ? <p> # EMILY # ( weakly ) Yeah .

He finds two photographs , one of Emily hugging him , the other of Emily with a beautiful sharp-eyed girl at a party , drinks in hand . <p> Sorting more papers , he finds a red card with a sequined mask on the front . The bottom edge has been torn off . <p> EXT . PARKING LOT - DAY <p> Sixth period has broke . Masses of students pile into busses . <p> 7 <p> EXT .

But I guess you were always the brains of the outfit.1 <p> 1 One of many instances of an allusion to the Jerr backstory , most of which were trimmed back in the editing process for clarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand alone short story , but probably never will , so in a nutshell : when Brendan and Emily were still an item she started hanging out with Jerr , a small time dealer . Brendan didn ! t approve , so he partnered up with Jerr then ratted him out to Trueman . Emily found out , and that led to their breakup on the field , which we see in a flashback . <p> 9 <p> # BRENDAN # Where 's Emily ? <p> # KARA # Sometimes I wonder why I dumped you . <p> # BRENDAN # ( standing to go ) God . <p> # KARA # I do n't know where she 's at , Brendan . <p> # BRENDAN # I know you do , so why do n't you want me to find her ? <p> # KARA # Maybe I 'm looking out for you . <p> # BRENDAN # ( going ) Well I appreciate that . <p> # KARA # Brendan ... you looking to get back into things ?

DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS <p> Cramped and empty . Pictures of Kara with friends are stuck in the mirror . Brendan roughly searches drawers , bags , pockets ... nothing . He stops . A red edge behind one of the photos - the same red card with a mask on it , but whole . Across the bottom in small print : " Halloween in January - Call for DETAILS - 555-2394 " <p> INT . BRENDAN 'S ROOM - NIGHT <p> Brendan pulls a phone across his desk and dials the number on the flyer . <p> 10 <p> WOMAN 'S VOICE ( over phone ) Hello ? <p> Brendan hesitates . <p> # BRENDAN # Hello , ma'am , this is Tom , I 'm a friend from school .

It 's a rather exclusive gathering . <p> # BRENDAN # I can imagine . ( she starts to speak , he cuts her off ) You should really work on your invite management . That might be a personal ' room for improvement ' area in your life . But discretion of your invite sending aside , I have procured a certain someone 's invitation , and would like details . <p> A beat of silence . <p> 11 <p> LAURA 'S VOICE You think you 're cute , whoever you are . <p> # BRENDAN # Wait 'll you get a load of my felt fedora and spats . <p> LAURA 'S VOICE Who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRENDAN # You do n't know me - I 'll save you some time . <p> LAURA 'S VOICE I know everyone and I 've got all the time in the world . <p> # BRENDAN # Folly of youth .

Buzz 42 at the gate . Nine o'clock . But who- <p> Brendan hangs up . He folds his hands under his chin and stares at the phone , perfectly still . The clock on his desk says 4:53 . <p> DISSOLVE TO : <p> 7:37 <p> Brendan at his desk , tapping away at Tetris . <p> DISSOLVE TO : <p> 8:30 <p> The desk is empty , Tetris paused . A shower runs behind an ajar door in the background . <p> 12 <p> EXT . STOCKTON COVE GATE - NIGHT <p> An imposing private community gate . Brendan coasts up on his bike and ditches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directory : " 42  --  DANNON " <p> Using the call box as a hand hold he hops the gate and walks briskly up the street . <p> EXT . STOCKTON COVE STREET - NIGHT <p> Shiny cars line the curb . Party noises come from an upscale two story house . Brendan takes a short breath , then strides up to the front door . <p> INT . LIVING ROOM <p> Large and clean , with a two story ceiling and a railed staircase at one end . Fifteen or twenty clean people , some in costumes , mill about in cliques . Brendan comes in as if he does n't mind who sees him coming in . He gets a couple odd stares , but no one stops him . <p> With non obtrusive confidence he cuts through the crowd to the beer keg in back and draws half a cup . <p> INT . PARLOUR - SAME <p> Richly adorned , crowded , lit with bright pools of light . Brendan drifts in and stands in the back , deep in shadow . <p> The music comes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dannon leans against it . She wears a red kimono , and is striking against the velvet black piano . Laura 's kid sister , 11 years old with glasses , sits at the piano playing " All I do is Dream of You " . <p> Laura sings , lovely and soft but with strength.1 <p> Brendan watches from the back , his face obscured in shadow , but his eyes gleam . Through the darkened window behind him a match flares up , and someone standing outside lights a cigarette . <p> Laura finishes the song . The room applauds , and she ruffles her kid sister 's hair . <p> Brendan ducks out , and into <p> 1 By the time we got around to production this had changed to " Someone to Watch Over Me , " but the publishing rights proved too expensive ( i.e. not free . ) We chose the Gilbert &; Sullivan song , which besides being lovely was also in the public domain ( i.e. free . ) <p> 13 <p> INT . LIVING ROOM - SAME <p> Brad Bramish , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits slouched on the couch in a dense crowd . He holds a cup and speaks much too loudly to a guy named Biff at his elbow . <p> # BRAD # If the coach wants to play me I 'll play , but I ca n't put my best game in if I 've got to worry about whether I 'm going to be in there . Halftime last game , coach is pissed I ran it on a pass play , out on the field he says to me ' you got ta think about the team and you got ta ' you know and ' if you run that ball again you 're out ' , and I said to him you got ta let me play ! I 'm out there , let me play , and he 's saying ' no you 're out ' and I kept saying ' Let me play ! Let me play ! Let me play !

' <p> Brad hunches forward , his face swollen purple , yelling that over and over . Tom steps in front of Brendan , blocking his line of sight . <p> Brendan scans the rest of the room . His eyes catch on Laura , leaning against a divan . Her bright , sharp eyes cut through the room , straight into Brendan . <p> He wags his eyebrows at her . <p> She looks away quickly . Brendan turns back to Brad , still shouting ' let me play ' . Tom stands between them . <p> # BRENDAN # Tom ! <p> Brad falls silent . Most of the room follows suit . Tom turns around . Brendan smiles good naturedly . <p> BRENDAN ( cont 'd ) Could you step aside , please ? I 'm trying to follow Brad 's story , and it 's difficult when I ca n't see his face . <p> 14 <p> The room watches Brendan . Tom mumbles something and steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dopey grin and tips his glass . <p> # BRAD # ( stumbles ) He does n't give me a play to make , what can I do , you know ? <p> He falls into awkward silence . Biff starts babbling . <p> Brendan looks at Brad , who is staring back at him . <p> Brendan then slowly drags his gaze over to Laura , staring at him too , her eyes slightly amused . Brendan cocks an eyebrow . The slightest hint of a smile takes the corner of her mouth , and she wags her eyebrows once at him . <p> Brendan glances back at Brad , looking at Laura now , not amused at all . <p> Brendan stands to go . Biff chatters on . Brad cuts him off . <p> BRAD ( cont 'd ) Hey . Hey ! What are you doing here ? <p> # BRENDAN # Leaving . <p> # BRAD # Oh yeah ? <p> # BRENDAN # Uh huh . Unless your anecdote 's got a 2nd act . <p> # BRAD # Why do n't you leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I was doing . <p> INT . DARK ROOM <p> With a lit wet bar at one end . Brendan goes to the bar , puts ice in a glass and cracks it with liquor . <p> # LAURA # ( O.S. ) Whiskey ? <p> Brendan pauses , glass touching his lips . <p> 15 <p> # BRENDAN # Jameson . <p> He downs half of it . <p> # LAURA # I like a man who knows what he 's drinking . <p> # BRENDAN # That 's a pretty sick thing to be attracted to . <p> # LAURA # Brad 's not a good guy to get on the wrong side of . <p> # BRENDAN # Uh huh . <p> They stare at each other in silence . She studies his face . The broken light of the bar makes her features seem liquid . <p> # LAURA # Fearless flyer . Quit your yappin and fix me one . <p> and slips out a sliding glass door . <p> He fills another glass with whiskey and cuts his with water . <p> EXT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a drink . Suburban lights fill the valley below . Laura sips her drink . <p> # LAURA # I 'll never get through all this . <p> # BRENDAN # Uh huh . <p> She sips more . <p> # LAURA # I knew your old partner Jerr since grade school . Tough break . How long were you two joined up before your operation got the sting ? <p> 16 <p> # BRENDAN # A few months . Could have helped himself out by turning me in , but he took the heat . He was a good guy . Solid . <p> # LAURA # Was he ? <p> # BRENDAN # You knew him . <p> # LAURA # Yeah I did . So why are you here tonight ? <p> # BRENDAN # I 'm looking for Emily . <p> # LAURA # She was n't invited . <p> # BRENDAN # She had an invitation . <p> # LAURA # Well like you said , I 've got to work on that .

So what did she tell you ? <p> # BRENDAN # ( winces ) Score 0 for finesse . <p> # LAURA # Listen , you 're scratching at the wrong door . I was n't with Emily enough to know details of what she was in , I just got wind of the downfall , and I did n't get any details of that , except that it was bad . So now that we 're showing some cards ... <p> # BRENDAN # If you have n't got a finger in Em 's troubles , why 'd her name get me into your rather exclusive party ? <p> 17 <p> # LAURA # Keep up with me now . I do n't know , but it sounded like you did , and a body 's got a right to be curious . Now I 'm not so sure . <p> # BRENDAN # Well I 'll put that body to bed .

Laura studies Brendan 's face , then seems to come to a decision . <p> # LAURA # Coffee and pie . <p> The words hang in the air a moment . A look of recognition from Brendan . <p> # BRENDAN # Coffee and pie oh my ? <p> # LAURA # And you did n't hear it from me . <p> He sips his drink . A voice calls from the glass door . Another girl . Laura flashes Brendan a look and goes to her . They have quick , quiet words and the girl leaves . Laura turns back to Brendan . <p> LAURA ( CONT 'D ) ( cont 'd ) Will you wait here for me ? <p> # BRENDAN # Sure . <p> # LAURA # You 'll stay right here and wait  --  I 'll be five minutes . <p> # BRENDAN # Yes . <p> The moment she leaves Brendan runs across the lawn and hops the fence , into the neighbor 's yard . <p> EXT . SIDE OF HOUSE <p> Brendan runs to the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front door , cuts across the lawn and sidewalk and trots out into the street . Brendan <p> 18 <p> begins to follow , but a noise from behind the fence stops him - a match being struck . <p> Brendan creeps towards the fence and peers through a splintered hole . <p> BRENDAN 'S POV - THROUGH THE FENCE <p> A brightly lit window in the side of Brad 's house , and through the window the party . <p> A dark figure wearing a long coat and broad rimmed hat , all inky black . The figure smokes a cigarette and watches the party , absently stroking his cheek . <p> Brendan steps back - SNAP ! A twig . <p> The figure freezes . Then , making no noise at all , it spins to face Brendan , a towering black form against the window . <p> The glowing cigarette falls to the grass . <p> A metallic glint , and a clicking sound not unlike a gun . <p> Brendan throws himself backwards onto the grass . A beat . <p> Through the hole the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitates , then hops the fence . <p> EXT . SIDE OF BRAD 'S HOUSE - SAME <p> Brendan lands on his feet . No black figure to be found . <p> The cigarette still smolders on the ground . Hand rolled , plain paper . <p> Brendan gazes through the window , catching his breath . Then he breaks the trance and creeps towards the street . <p> EXT . FRONT LAWN - NIGHT <p> Peeking around the house , Brendan sees Laura cut across the lawn and trot into the street . Using parked cars as cover , Brendan follows . <p> EXT . STREET <p> Between cars , Brendan sees a lanky kid in baggy jeans and engineer boots with a clean shaven head leaning against a black Mustang . Laura goes to him and speaks quickly . <p> 19 <p> The dark figure in the hat emerges from the shadows . Laura says something to him . Grunting something angrily , he gets in the car with the bald kid and peels off . <p> Laura turns and slowly walks towards the house . <p> When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house and walks off down the street , towards the guard gate . <p> EXT .

CARROWS PARKING LOT - DAY <p> The sun rises over Carrows family restaurant , a squat structure backed against the weedy edge of the runoff tunnel ravine . <p> A banner from 1973 in the window - " Coffee and Pie oh my ! " <p> A pack of six pale stoners slump against the rear dumpster . Their beady eyes follow Brendan in sync as he approaches . <p> He goes to the nearest one . <p> # BRENDAN # Where 's Dode ? <p> STONER 1 Du n no , bra . <p> Silence and blank stares . Brendan calmly moves to the next stoner . <p> # BRENDAN # Dode ? <p> STONER 2 Uh uh . <p> Brendan moves to the next one . <p> A thin head pokes from around the dumpster . <p> # DODE # Hey Brendan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the dumpster . Dode slumps against the wall , thin and delicate in dusty black . Slivery eyes , pale lips , muffled intelligence . <p> 20 <p> # BRENDAN # Kara told me you know where Em 's at . <p> # DODE # Uh huh . And why are you looking for Em ? <p> # BRENDAN # She asked for my help . <p> # DODE # Uh huh .

Where 's she at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . <p> Brendan does n't . <p> DODE ( cont 'd ) Heel it now , dig ? <p> The 5 big stoners appear behind Brendan , threatening . Dode turns his head away to light a joint . <p> Brendan 's fist slams into his face , sending the joint spinning . Brendan slams Dode 's frail frame against the dumpster . <p> The 5 stoners stand in the exact same position , deer in the headlights . One makes a half hearted motion to intervene . <p> 21 <p> # BIG STONER # Back off . <p> # BRENDAN # Throw one at me if you want , hash head . I 've got all five senses and I slept last night , that puts me six up on the lot of you . <p> # BIG STONER # Just easy- <p> Brendan slams Dode into the wall . <p> # BRENDAN # ( to Dode ) Where 's Em ? <p> # DODE # ( deliberate ) She 's with me . She was tight when she called you , man . Came to and freaked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Said you 'd only make things worse . <p> Brendan covers how shaken he is by this statement fairly well . He drops Dode . <p> STONER 1 ( O.S. ) Put him down , man ! <p> # DODE # Deal with whatever this ai n't about and drop it . <p> # BIG STONER # ( to Brendan ) Nothing more here , bra . <p> # BRENDAN # Tell Emily I want to see her .

She knows where I eat lunch . <p> 22 <p> When Brendan is a safe distance away the biggest stoner shouts with conviction <p> # BIG STONER # And stay out , punk ! <p> EXT . SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS <p> Brendan hides behind a tall clump of bushes . <p> A moment later Dode hustles away from Carrows . Brendan follows . <p> EXT . STREET @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tails Dode through the twisty suburban streets . <p> Brendan takes cover as Dode stops by a white hatchback . <p> A girl gets out of the car and embraces Dode . Her wrist is adorned with the same cheap plastic bracelets as the dead girl 's arm . Dode speaks quickly to her , she nods and speaks back . He hands her a slip of paper , which she tucks into a brightly colored address book and slips in her jacket pocket . They embrace again , Dode walks off and the girl gets in her car . <p> Brendan stumbles after the car , but it is quickly gone . He watches it go , then follows Dode back towards school . <p> EXT . SCHOOL THEATER - MORNING <p> Dode slumps into the front door of the brown building . Brendan watches him from a distance , eyes thoughtful . After a beat he turns and walks off into the thickening crowds of students . <p> FADE OUT : <p> FADE UP <p> EXT . BACK OF SCHOOL - MIDDAY <p> Brendan eats lunch alone on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school . <p> # LATER # <p> Reclining on the wall , reading " Lord of the Flies " .

Brendan jumps and hits the ground running towards the figure . <p> Meet the girl with cheap bracelets , the girl Dode spoke to , the dead girl , Emily . He catches her just as she stumbles and falls and carries her into the shade of a covered hallway . <p> EXT . SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS <p> Emily and Brendan sit in silence . She is very pretty , but she looks bad . Too much makeup , not enough sleep . She sniffles , speaks to her shoes . <p> # EMILY # I must have sounded pretty crazy on the phone . Yesterday . <p> She taps her shoes together lightly , eyes fixed on them . <p> EMILY ( cont 'd ) It was dumb , I got paranoid over a really stupid thing . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now you have to forget about it . Please . That 's how you can help me now , forget about it . <p> She turns her weak eyes to Brendan for the first time . His stare is unwavering , searching . She pushes on . <p> EMILY ( cont 'd ) Brendan , I know you 're mad at all these people , cause you think I went away from you and went to them . But you 've got to start seeing it as my decision , stop being angry because where I want to be at 's different from where you wan na be at . <p> # BRENDAN # ( angry ) Who fed you that line , Em ? <p> She looks back at her shoes . <p> # EMILY # And stop picking on Dode .

I loved you alot but I could n't stand it , I had to get with people . I could n't heckle life with you , I had to see what was what . <p> A beat . She taps her clogs . One has a hole worn through the sole . Her face contorts , seizes up , and she is sobbing . <p> EMILY ( cont 'd ) I 'm sorry Brendan . <p> She buries her face in his shoulder . He has a hard time speaking . <p> # BRENDAN # You 've got to come back to me , Em . <p> # EMILY # No . No . Never . I 'm sorry . Never . I ca n't love on your terms , Brendan .

Make sure that , you 've got to , promise you wo n't torture yourself , that you 'll let me go . <p> She embraces him , enveloping him in her jacket . His face is a frozen mask . <p> EMILY ( cont 'd ) Let me go . <p> As she pulls away he mechanically slips an address book from her jacket pocket . <p> He watches her as she walks away . <p> INT . CLASSROOM <p> Brendan sits in the back , flipping through the address book . The teacher drones on about the significance of the pig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> THE ADDRESS BOOK <p> Illegible scribbles , names , numbers , nothing that stops his search - then the note Dode gave her , a corner of loose-leaf paper which looks like this : <p> Brendan studies the paper intently . <p> EXT . SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY <p> The Brain studies the paper . Busses pull into the parking lot behind them . Brendan is distant , lost in thought . <p> # THE BRAIN # Hm . Do you know anything else about this ? <p> 1 Our one and only scene in a classroom was moved to Brendan ! s lunch spot to save us a location change . The degree to which the lack of classroom time in the film has been commented on has always bemused the author , who can not for the life of him remember a single interesting thing that happened in a classroom in high school . <p> 26 <p> # BRENDAN # ( shakes his head ) Mm . <p> # THE BRAIN # Slim pickings . Why 'd you let Dode fly when he came back to whose-her-name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissively ) Kara . It 's their turf , I could n't hear them without being seen , and that would only biff their play . Best to know it 's there , let it ride and see what comes of it . ( touches the paper ) But anyway . <p> # THE BRAIN # Hm . Well , if this is what I think it is , it did n't come straight from Dode , less he 's playing out of his league . ( beat ) I can only give you my best guess . <p> # BRENDAN # Yeah . <p> # THE BRAIN # When the upper crust does shady deeds they do them in different spots around town . I know under the pier 's one , down by the bike trails in the state park 's another . There 's alot of them . The pitch is they 've got little symbols for each one , and that 's how they tell each other the place , so word wo n't get around . So this might be that . <p> # BRENDAN # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRAIN # This is upper crust . Dode 's pie pan grease . <p> Brendan studies the symbol . <p> # BRENDAN # Call anything up ? <p> 27 <p> # THE BRAIN # How many places start with ' A ' ? Or if it 's a shape , or just a random symbol . Anyway , even if you figured it out , what good could you do ? She 's smart , she knows the play , she 's gunning to square things . <p> # BRENDAN # Yeah . <p> # THE BRAIN # You said her business was none of yours , so she 's alright , forget it now . Go home , sleep . <p> INT . BRENDAN 'S BEDROOM - NIGHT <p> Sparsely furnished . Brendan plays Tetris on his computer , staring off into space . His mom 's voice calls " Good night " and the hallway light turns off . <p> # LATER # <p> 10:30 by the clock radio on Brendan 's nightstand . The slip of paper rests beside it . Brendan lies in bed , staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> # THE SYMBOL # <p> Growing larger , burning with a searing intensity , then folding into darkness . Water rushes overhead , over concrete , concrete with a hole in it  --  the runoff tunnel , just for an instant , then back underwater , screaming . Brendan choking , screaming , plunging upwards . A woman with no face falls from the darkness and kisses him , her long hair sweeping around him then pulling away . As the last strands slide off his face he wakes up with a start . <p> The clock says 3:46 . Brendan drips with sweat , breathing raggedly . He takes the paper and a pencil from the nightstand and shades the symbol to look like this : <p> FLASH CUT - The runoff tunnel , lining up perfectly with the now shaded symbol . <p> BACK TO BRENDAN <p> 28 <p> His eyes turn uneasy as he removes his glasses and clicks off the light . <p> EXT . BRENDAN 'S HOUSE - DAWN <p> Brendan walks off into the hazy pre-dawn light . <p> EXT . EDGE OF RAVINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to the low gurgle of moving water . Slowly , robotically he pushes through . <p> EMILY 'S BODY <p> Face down , bobbing gently in shallow water . Bluish white . Red foam clings to her . <p> EXT . RUNOFF TUNNEL <p> Silently , as if lowered by a string Brendan sinks down , squatting in the mud . His lungs empty in one choppy breath . He pulls his glasses off sluggishly . <p> EMILY 'S ARM <p> Lifeless , pale . <p> BRENDAN 'S FACE <p> A contorted , frozen mask , eyes wet . <p> EMILY 'S HAIR <p> Stringy , flowing gently in the water . <p> BRENDAN 'S EYES <p> Dazed , drifting ... then suddenly snapping to attention . <p> A noise . From the tunnel . <p> Brendan freezes . The inky blackness of the tunnel mouth opens like a vacuum ... silent , but then - <p> The scrape of a shoe against concrete , then echoing footsteps running away . <p> Brendan springs like a cat , sprinting into the tunnel . <p> 29 <p> INT . TUNNEL <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brendan is chasing , running full speed into the blackness , heart pounding - we almost do n't notice that Brendan 's are now the only footfalls . <p> Brendan notices . He stops . Silence in the darkness , except for Brendan 's breath ... and someone near ... <p> SLAM ! Brendan takes a fist in the cheek and goes down . An inky black figure steps from the shadows and kicks him in the stomach . Brendan curls on the ground , the figure over him . <p> # FIGURE # ( low whisper ) Your little Em . <p> The figure runs off . Brendan raises his head painfully - the figure is silhouetted briefly against the distant bright end of the tunnel , then is gone . <p> EXT . RUNOFF TUNNEL - EARLY MORNING <p> Emily 's body is still there . Brendan crawls out of the tunnel and collapses in the shallow water , beside the body . He rests his head on his arm , eyes on Em 's hair . <p> EXT . CAMPUS - EARLY MORNING <p> Cold and barren , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> EXT . PHONE BOOTHS <p> A line of phone booths on campus .

Hello ? <p> Brendan hangs up . <p> EXT . LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS <p> Early morning mist below a squat brick building . <p> 30 <p> INT . LIBRARY <p> Warmly lit , sheltering the few souls scattered here and there at tables . The Brain sits at one of them reading an impossibly large book . He watches curiously as Brendan approaches him . <p> # THE BRAIN # Hey , Brendan . <p> Brendan falls into a chair . The Brain looks him over . <p> THE BRAIN ( cont 'd ) You 're up early . <p> # BRENDAN # ( thick , distant ) I could n't sleep . <p> # THE BRAIN # ( nods , back to his book ) Find Emily ? <p> Brendan breathes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alright ? <p> # BRENDAN # Yeah .

He looks Brain in the eye , and his mannerisms come back into focus . <p> BRENDAN ( cont 'd ) I 'd need you to Op . Like on Jerr , but that was cake to this . And unlike Jerr , there 's not much chance we 'll come out clean . Twenty four seven on this one . You okay to op for me again ? <p> 32 <p> The Brain barely smiles . <p> # THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brendan puts on his glasses , stands to go . <p> # BRENDAN # No , bulls would gum it . They 'd flash their dusty standards at the wide-eyes and probably find some yegg to pin , probably even the right one . But they 'd trample the real tracks and scare the real players back into their holes , and if we 're doing this I want the whole story . No cops , not for a bit . <p> # THE BRAIN # So what first ? <p> # BRENDAN # I do n't know . Your mom still have the cell ? <p> # THE BRAIN # In her car . <p> # BRENDAN # Borrow it for a few days , get me the number . ( stands to go ) Wait for my word , and cover for me first period . I 'm going to be a little late . <p> EXT . BASKETBALL FIELD - DAY <p> A vast field of asphalt segmented by a dozen basketball courts outlined in cracked paint.1 Brendan trudges across it , his steps heavy . He stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beat then raising his eyes to <p> # THE HORIZON # <p> Flat , gray , pin straight . Brendan 's voice starts speaking rapidly , confident and clear . <p> 1 This describes the location at my school that the " showdown " scenes were originally written for . Between when I wrote the script and when we shot it , however , the school expanded and built portable classrooms on the basketball field , and so we reluctantly moved these scenes to the football field . <p> 33 <p> BRENDAN ( O.S. ) Yeah it was personal . Jerr spooked some decent gees and ran around some what was straight with him , but I 'm nobody 's bull runner . This was n't a business sit . But yeah . I bulled him . Got in tight , partnered up and sent him over . <p> PAN AROUND to reveal BRENDAN . He looks different , edgier , more alive , wearing different clothes and a thin goatee1 . He keeps talking directly at us . <p> BRENDAN ( cont 'd ) I 'd bull the lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole party if they tried to play you again . Jerr and whoever 's next . I want to keep you safe . <p> An ARM swings into frame , wearing cheap plastic bracelets and pale blue fingernail polish . It slaps Brendan hard in the face . He catches it . Emily wrenches her arm away and stumbles backwards onto the pavement . <p> Brendan grabs her sleeve . She twists away . He grabs her shoulder , grabs her waist , she resists , and suddenly they are struggling with violent pent up intensity until with a shout she breaks away and falls to the ground . <p> A beat . Gulls cry in the distance . <p> # EMILY # You ca n't keep me safe , Brendan . I 'm in a bigger world now , and you ca n't hide me from it , and you ca n't beat it . Not if I do n't want you to . <p> Brendan 's face looks lumpish , while Emily 's is strong . She stands and walks off into the distance across the barren field . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is back to present day , pale , clean shaven , sullen . His eyes are cold with resolve . <p> EXT . RUNOFF TUNNEL - EARLY MORNING <p> Brendan sloshes down into the water . Without delicacy he lifts Emily 's body and pulls her back into the tunnel . <p> INT . RUNOFF TUNNEL <p> 1 Which Joe would not even consider , thank god . <p> 34 <p> Pitch back . Brendan lays the body down . Two beady eyes peer at him from the darkness - he freezes . The eyes hop forward - a gull . The two watch each other for a moment , then the gull squawks and flutters out the bright mouth of the tunnel . Brendan follows it without looking back at the body.1 <p> EXT . CROWDED HALLWAY - DAY <p> Brendan and the Brain lean against a wall .

PARKING LOT - LUNCH <p> Brendan wanders through the thick lunchtime crowd towards a cluster of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far end of the lot . <p> Brad Bramish sits slouched in the front seat of his convertible , front door open . A small crowd hangs about Brad , his crony Biff at his elbow . <p> # BRAD # That 's all I 'm saying , is put me in the game and I 'll do what needs to be done , but they do n't put me in , what needs doing do n't get done and do n't come crying to me , man .

His eyes catch on Laura Dannon sitting in another convertible , off to the side . Her bright eyes cut through the crowd , straight into Brendan . <p> He wags his eyebrows at her . She looks away . Brendan walks into Brad 's direct line of view and obviously leans against one of the cars . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> 39 <p> # BRENDAN # Listening . <p> # BRAD # Uh huh . <p> # BRENDAN # Alright , you got me .

Brad 's face tenses . <p> BRAD ( cont 'd ) Maybe you want to go someplace more private . <p> # BRENDAN # With you ? <p> Brad says ' who else ? ' by lifting his arms . <p> BRENDAN ( cont 'd ) ( as if he 's been asked to the movies ) Sure . <p> Brendan stands and walks off . Brad follows and the rest of the crowd trails after him . <p> He leads them behind a parked VW van and turns to face Brad .

Brendan throws his short stocky frame into Brad 's larger one and tenderizes his midsection with jabs . <p> Brad tags Brendan in the ribs , then smacks the palm of his hand into Brendan 's face , shoving him back onto the pavement . <p> He comes at Brendan with his big fists clenched . <p> Brendan kicks Brad full force in the shins . <p> 41 <p> Brad tumbles , and Brendan comes up fast , connecting hard with the point of Brad 's chin . Brad gets his balance fast , and before Brendan can throw another he throws one himself , then another , both into Brendan 's stomach . Brendan pulls back and kicks Brad 's shin where he had kicked it before . Brad roars and hits Brendan very hard in the face . <p> Brendan bounces back like a rubber ball and throws his weight into a square punch right into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Brad falls backwards like a board . <p> He stays down , holding his face . <p> Brendan staggers back , breathing hard , and looks up at the small crowd .

The lanky kid is over him in a split second , beating his face and body with short , heavy blows . <p> Flashes of the lanky kid - a shiny scar shaped like a thin triangle runs down the side of his face . <p> After a brief silent thrashing the kid walks off with several other blurry figures . A car peels out and roars off O.S. <p> Brendan lies still . The class bell rings , very distant . Legs criss cross before his eyes , each blurring the world a bit more until it is completely smeared . <p> FADE OUT . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an ice pack against his head in a tiny office .

Parked in the supermarket parking lot is a black mustang . <p> EXT . PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON <p> The sun hangs low . Brendan approaches the car and walks around it slowly . He peers inside . A tuft of paper pokes out from under the seat . He pulls the door handle , locked . <p> 49 <p> Brendan picks up a broken chunk of concrete from the ground , waddles over to the car and holds the chunk above his head , ready to drop it through the window . <p> He stops . His eyes catch something in the distance . <p> The lanky shaved-head kid , whose name is Tugger . Coming towards him fast . <p> Brendan stands there for a moment , then lets the chunk fall to the ground . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts them in a hard case and puts the hard case in his pocket . <p> Tugger hits him like a train and throws him across the pavement . Tug turns back to the car and takes out his keys . <p> Brendan gets up and comes towards Tug , his face stiff . Tug turns and pops him once squarely in the mouth . Brendan falls to his knees . <p> While Tug unlocks the door Brendan stands up woozily . Grunting , Tug spins and grabs Brendan 's jacket , pushing him back while he slaps him hard in the face , back and forth , three times . When Tug lets go Brendan drops like a stone , catching himself on his hands and knees . The car door slams . <p> The mustang drives about a hundred yards out into the parking lot , spins around and stops , facing Brendan . Its motor purrs deeply . Brendan begins to limp towards it doggedly , head up , eyes fixed . <p> A crackling roar and short squeal of tires spit the mustang forward . It comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brendan stops walking and stands very still , eyes steady . The gap between him and the car closes in no time at all . <p> It speeds past him not six inches to his left , brushing the edge of his jacket . Brakes squeal behind him .

TRUNK OF MOVING MUSTANG <p> Brendan holds the trunk about three inches open , just enough to see which street signs pass by . Loud music plays from the car  --  " Sweet Baby James " by James Taylor.1 <p> The car zooms on . <p> BRENDAN 'S POV <p> Through the ajar trunk . The mustang slides to a stop beside an elaborate wooden mailbox carved as an eagle 's head . Brendan closes the trunk . <p> EXT . FRONT OF HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON <p> A small one story house , slightly run down . Tugger opens the trunk and drags Brendan out , covering his eyes with a palm , slams the trunk and goes inside . <p> When they are gone the broken trunk drifts open . <p> INT . BASEMENT HALLWAY <p> A very dim narrow hall with a steep stairway at one end , dark doors down the length of it and a lit door at the other end . Tugger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the lit room . <p> 1 Unfortunately Mr. Taylor flatly refused , which , given the context , was probably wise . <p> 51 <p> Brendan lifts his head painfully . Surrounding him in the darkened doorways are dozens of boys , some dressed like Tugger , others dressed in black . <p> Tug pokes his head out . <p> # TUGGER # Alright . <p> Arms pop out of the darkness and drag Brendan towards the lit room . <p> INT . KINGPIN 'S DEN <p> A small room , amazingly messy . Clothes strewn about , groves of empty bottles , precarious piles of books . The overall impression though is not of jumbled chaos , but of a nest , comfortably woven and very worn in . <p> A slim figure with wispy hair sits facing the wall at a small desk , writing under a green bookkeeper 's lamp . <p> Brendan is shoved into the center of the room . Tug and his clones slump against the surrounding walls . Brendan watches the thin figure 's back . For a beat the only noise is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sighs and swivels around . <p> Mid to late twenties . Sallow features , tired eyes . His clothes are so richly black it is difficult to make out specific items  --  he is just one inky black mass from the neck down and eyebrows up . <p> # BRENDAN # You the Pin ? <p> # PIN # Yeah .

Anyway you 've been sniffing me out before then , sniffing for me like a vampire bat for a horse <p> 52 <p> with a nick on its ear he can suck on . They do that . ( Brendan blinks ) So now you got Tugger to bring you here , which he never does , and you got me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that better be really , really good . <p> # BRENDAN # Call Ms. Dannon in from the hall first ; she ought a hear this . <p> # PIN # ( amused ) No dice , soldier . Would have been a neat trick , though . <p> # BRENDAN # ( shrugs , then slowly ) I was going to make up some bit of information or set up some phony deal , anything so you 'd let me walk . Then I was going to go to the vice principal and spill him the street address of the biggest dope port in the burgh . <p> The Pin 's eyes shoot to Tugger , who does n't flinch . <p> # TUGGER # He knows zippo . <p> # BRENDAN # 1250 Vista Blanca , the ink blotter at the desk in the den in the basement of the house with the tacky mailbox . <p> The world turns on its side as Tugger pushes Brendan 's head down into the carpet . <p> # TUGGER # You gon na do what now ? ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is twice the size of the other . <p> # PIN # No good , soldier . <p> The cronies around the room begin cackling . Tug 's face is a mask of rage . Brendan ca n't breath . His face swells . <p> 53 <p> PIN ( cont 'd ) Alright , let up . <p> But Tug does n't let up . Brendan 's world grows hazy , the cackling laughter reverberates , then a clean voice pierces the din . <p> # LAURA # ( OS ) Tug , stop . <p> Tug 's face breaks for a moment , and he lets go . Brendan 's head lolls to the side . Laura stands in the dark doorway . <p> Brendan sees Tug 's knuckles and a flash of white for a split moment as Tug hits him in the face . The Pin 's black body spills out across the frame , leaving us in black . <p> FADE UP <p> SMALL DARK ROOM <p> Brendan wakes up curled on a mattress on the floor . A bare light bulb hangs from the ceiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry dog . Brendan stares back at him through thick , glazed eyes . <p> # BRENDAN # Where are my glasses ? ( Tugger grins ) Hell with ya then . Which wall 's the door in ? <p> Tug points , amused . Brendan heaves himself up , and Tug shoves him back down . <p> Brendan winks at him , stands and lurches towards the door again . <p> Tugger grabs his shirt and slams him into the wall , but freezes when he hears a door latch click . Sneering , he drops Brendan back onto the mattress and sits against the opposite wall . <p> Sounds of a door opening and closing come from the darkness . Light footsteps clack on the cement floor . Suddenly Tug vanishes  --  the room 's darkness just seems to swallow him . <p> The thin whispery voice of the Pin speaks softly . <p> # PIN # Sorry about this kid , but what the hell with what you said before . <p> 54 <p> His disembodied face appears a few feet about where Tug had sat . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all of us and the Tug a fist away , you 've got to use your nut . Allay the situation , So yeah , you 're not scared of me , I got it , but I 'm also thinking you 're a little nuts now , so you 've got that trade off with your standing . But nuts is n't all bad , so maybe it was a good play . I do n't know . <p> He is standing in front of Tug . His black clothes and broad rimmed black hat blend perfectly with the dark room , such that his face seems to bob about in space . Brendan stifles a cough . <p> PIN ( cont 'd ) So , Laura talked me down . Let 's get you upstairs , back with the living . <p> INT .

The lug looms over him , his knife hand flashing . Brendan 's jacket shoulder tears open , and the white filling inside turns red . He stumbles back blindly , gets his footing and scrambles out of reach . <p> Brendan sprints away , down the hall , gaining about thirty feet on the lug before turning the corner . <p> Brendan drops to a sitting position . <p> THE LUG AROUND THE CORNER <p> Running fast . <p> 63 <p> # BRENDAN # <p> Kicks his shoes off and clambers to his feet .

A hollow gong reverberates through the hallway , and the lug falls like a puppet with his strings cut . <p> A wallet with a couple of twenties and a student ID ( CHUCK BURNS ) , three hash pipes , fifteen joints , a baggie of weed and a large brownie in another baggie . <p> Brendan leaves it all on him and staggers off . <p> EXT .

He wants to talk straight , and you 're going to work with him for whatever he needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TUGGER # Hell I do n't . <p> # BRENDAN # The Pin 's sitting on the brick profits - hitting him now would be post . Make peace and wait for your chance . <p> # LAURA # He 's right , Tug . Smooth it out . <p> 93 <p> # BRENDAN # ( between coughs ) Besides , he 's got you on the Dode thing . War 'll mean you vs. him and every bull in the burgh . <p> Tugger turns away , thinking . <p> # TUGGER # Yeah , we 'll talk . <p> # LAURA # ( to Brendan ) You going ? <p> # BRENDAN # Yeah . <p> She nods . Brendan stumbles into the bedroom . <p> INT . TUGGER 'S BEDROOM - NIGHT <p> Brendan lies on his back . Sweat stands on his forehead . <p> # THE FAN # <p> Spinning dizzily from Brendan 's POV . Then the fan is still and the room is spinning , then the fan , then the room . Brendan clamps his eyes shut . A door creaks open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Laura floats across the room to him . Her hair falls around him . Brendan shrinks back . She puts a pale hand on his clammy forehead . Brendan tries to speak , but can not . <p> He fingers slide over his face . She pulls off his glasses . <p> Her hands all over his face . Brendan 's throat contorts in a hard swallow . His eyes are wet . <p> Her hair , her hands all warm and gentle , touching him . <p> # LAURA # I 'm sorry Brendan . <p> Brendan breaks . In silent sobs first , then shivering with an almighty release he cries like a baby in her arms . <p> # THE FAN # <p> 94 <p> Spinning above them . <p> Laura lights a cigarette . They lie beside each other . <p> # LAURA # Do n't go tonight . <p> # BRENDAN # I 've got to make sure it plays out smooth . <p> # LAURA # It 'll play however it plays without you there . <p> # BRENDAN # I 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # BRENDAN # Cause if there 's war , I 'm in it too . <p> # LAURA # Well let 's just , I mean why not just run away . Go somewhere . I 've got a car . ( Brendan gives a wry look ) I 've got an aunt in New Orleans , she would n't care . ( Brendan grins ) Yeah , it 's a stupid thing , but think about it , why not ? What , school ? C'm on . Family ? <p> # BRENDAN # Alright , stop . <p> Her smoke drifts into the fan . <p> # LAURA # I was n't serious , but we could go for awhile . Just until everything clears . <p> Brendan watches the smoke . She stubs the butt out in an ash tray on the table and curls against his chest . <p> Stretching his arm across the table , he nonchalantly spins the ash tray around with his finger . <p> His glasses lay on the table . Through the left lens the cigarette is magnified . Pale blue arrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretches across his chest . He looks at it , then up at the fan , spinning . <p> # LATER # <p> Brendan slips out of bed . A glowing clock radio reads " 3:16 " . <p> INT .

TUGGER 'S HOUSE - NIGHT <p> Brendan slides into the black mustang and gutters off into the night . <p> EXT . STREET - NIGHT <p> Overlooking a twinkling valley of suburban lights . Brendan talks at a payphone beside the curbed mustang . <p> # THE BRAIN # ( on phone ) Yeah . <p> # BRENDAN # Alright , I warned you . Can you get the car ? <p> # THE BRAIN # Yeah . <p> # BRENDAN # Go to 2014 Clancy , off Pico west of La Grange . Park outside and wait . Laura 's inside .

FRONT OF PIN 'S HOUSE - NIGHT <p> Brendan pulls the mustang into the driveway , limps up to the front door and knocks . One of the Pin 's boys lets him in . <p> 97 <p> INT . KITCHEN - SAME <p> Crowded with tense looking punks , half dressed like the Pin and half like Tugger . The Pin 's mom is shuffling about , pouring them milk . <p> INT . BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME <p> Several more punks from both camps crowd the hall , and more lean in the darkened doorways . Brendan passes through quickly . <p> INT . PIN 'S DEN - SAME <p> The Pin at his desk , flanked by two of his boys . Tug sits in the center of the room , two of his punks beside him . Brendan saunters between them and leans against the dresser . <p> # BRENDAN # Talk . <p> # PIN # I want full assurance that any heat from Emily and Dode is gon na be on just you . I do n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you owe me six Cs , no rush , but I want your shake that it 'll come home in not too much time . <p> Tug 's eyes burn , his scar reddens . <p> # BRENDAN # ( to Tug ) That 's square . You did them after all . Lay low it 'll blow over . Stick on this , one of you 'll dish it to bury the other and you 'll both get the rap . As to the six , did you borrow it ? <p> # TUGGER # Yeah . <p> # BRENDAN # Then you owe it . Should n't need a shake on that . <p> Tug looks at the Pin . <p> # TUGGER # Alright to both . <p> 98 <p> # BRENDAN # Good . Let 's seal it up and blow for keeps . <p> # PIN # Third thing .

Deal ? <p> # PIN # Fine . Tangles . <p> # BRENDAN # Johnny , go with him . <p> They go . <p> Tug just stares at Brendan , then tosses his hands up slightly and turns away . <p> They all wait . <p> CRASH ! from the next room . Everyone freezes . More breaking , then scuffling and shouting . <p> The two punks look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow , but Brendan holds him back . <p> 100 <p> The noise through the wall grows tremendous , a full brawl . The ceiling pounds and shudders with footfalls and bodies hitting the ground . <p> Then , from not too far away , a gunshot . <p> The Pin stands and goes towards the door , but Brendan shouts <p> BRENDAN ( cont 'd ) No ! <p> and slams it shut . A few tense seconds . <p> Another gunshot . Footfalls , then Tangles falls through the door , his chest red . The Pin bends over him . <p> # TANGLES # ( gasping ) The brick , it 's gone . The brick 's gone . <p> Tangles stops gasping . <p> The Pin stands , eyes blazing at Tug . <p> # PIN # Make peace , huh ? Talk it out ? Get your boys in my den soes you could snag it under my nose ? <p> Tug 's scar is fiery red . He coils his body , snarling . <p> # TUGGER # Alright ! <p> # BRENDAN # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it bad , Tug ? Snag it so I do n't know , or sell it off to flat the war odds ? <p> # BRENDAN # ( shouts ) Pin , think about it- <p> # TUGGER # Alright , I did all that ! <p> Tug blows past Brendan like a train and slams the Pin into the ground with his fist . He punctuates his words with hard straight blows into the Pin 's face . <p> 101 <p> TUGGER ( cont 'd ) I cut the brick , I stole the money , I faked a peace , I snagged your junk , I did it all ! <p> He pulls the gun . <p> Brendan shouts and throws himself on Tug 's arm , wrenching it sideways . The gun clunks onto the carpet . <p> The Pin flips Tug over and for a moment Brendan is caught between them , hit and torn , rolling over the gun . Tug grabs it , Brendan grabs his wrist and the gun goes off , firing into the ceiling . Plaster sprays . <p> Brendan screams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloodied jacket and out from between the two . <p> The Pin is on top , pinning Tug 's gun hand to the carpet , straining to keep it there . <p> Brendan leaps to his feet , staggers , then winds up and kicks Tug in the wrist with all his strength . <p> A terrible crunching popping sound . Tug roars . Brendan takes the gun from his limp hand . <p> # PIN # Do him ! <p> Brendan backs off a few steps . The Pin strains to keep Tug down . <p> PIN ( cont 'd ) Do him now ! <p> Brendan stumbles back . Tug roars , flips the Pin over and beats his face mercilessly . <p> Brendan stumbles out into the hall . <p> INT . BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME <p> Empty . From the darkened doorways and the thin ceiling relentless sounds of fighting . <p> Brendan walks backwards as if in a trance , eyes glued to the Pin 's door . Inside wild shadows splay across the walls , and the Pin shouts Brendan 's name . <p> Light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splinters . Brendan spins on his heel and fires three shots into the darkness , which falls silent . <p> 102 <p> He turns the gun back on the Pin 's doorway . <p> With a spray of sparks the doorway turns dark . They broke the lamp . <p> The dark doorway looms up before Brendan , inky black . Horrible sounds come from it , blows , breaking bone , screams . The Pin screams Brendan 's name over and over , calling for help . Pleading . Brendan steps back . <p> Time slows down . Brendan drops the gun . <p> It thunks on the carpet . <p> In one motion Brendan kicks the gun down the hall into the Pin 's doorway , turns and runs into the room where he found the brick . <p> INT . STORAGE ROOM <p> Dark . Brendan runs through , clawing past dark fighting shapes , running like a man possessed . He breaks through the darkness and heaves himself up through the small window . <p> EXT . FRONT OF PIN 'S HOUSE - NIGHT <p> Brendan scrambles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard . <p> Two sharp gunshots come from the house . <p> Everything is suddenly still . Brendan stands slowly . <p> He notices a light from the Mustang - the trunk has drifted open . <p> Inside , a pale blue arm lies tangled in black plastic . Blue fingernails . Cheap plastic bracelets . <p> Brendan shuts the trunk solidly , then walks off down the street and vanishes into the inky night . <p> A moment later police cars pull up , sirens blaring , lights turning the dark streets bright as day . <p> # FADE OUT # <p> FADE IN : <p> EXT . SCHOOL PAYPHONE - EARLY MORNING <p> The morning is cold and clammy . Brendan slumps against the payphone . <p> 103 <p> # BRENDAN # Hey . Where are you ? <p> # THE BRAIN # ( on phone ) Library .

Tell her I wan na meet up on the basketball field in half an hour , then go home and get some sleep . <p> # THE BRAIN # Alright . <p> Brendan hangs up , then pauses , lost in thought . <p> EXT . SIDE OF GYM - LATER <p> Brendan sits against the massive gym building , writing on a piece of looseleaf paper . <p> EXT . ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - LATER <p> Brendan slips the paper under a door stenciled " VP Offices " . <p> 104 <p> EXT . BASKETBALL FIELD - LATER <p> Cold , barren . Wind whistles softly and jangles the metal mesh basketball nets like windchimes . <p> Brendan stands crookedly , hands in pockets , eyes trained on the cold black horizon . A speck appears . Brendan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Laura . She puts her arms around him , a warm embrace . Brendan draws back . <p> # LAURA # ( softly ) Did you see it all ? With Tug and the Pin ? <p> Brendan looks at her a moment . <p> # BRENDAN # No . I took your advice and did n't go . <p> # LAURA # ( confused ) No ? <p> # BRENDAN # What happened ? <p> Laura looks at him strangely , a little uneasy . <p> # LAURA # The papers say six dead , three around the house , one girl in the trunk of Tug 's car , and the Pin and Tug . <p> Brendan 's face is frozen in an ambiguous frown . <p> # BRENDAN # Yeah ? <p> # LAURA # Tug tried to shoot his way out when the police got there . They tied him to Dode , too . Same gun . And the girl . <p> # BRENDAN # Huh . <p> # LAURA # Well good thing you were n't there . <p> 105 <p> # BRENDAN # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> # LAURA # You think the girl was Emily ? <p> # BRENDAN # Probably . <p> Laura embraces him again , and does n't let go . <p> # LAURA # You loved her . <p> # BRENDAN # ( distant ) Yeah I did . <p> # LAURA # You did all this cause you loved her . And now it 's finished . ( tightens her embrace ) I love you . <p> # BRENDAN # No . <p> Laura pulls back , looks at his face . It is a mask . <p> # LAURA # What ? <p> # BRENDAN # No , it 's not finished . Tug pulled the trigger on Em and he got the fall , but the bulls coulda found that out without me . <p> Laura pulls back more . <p> BRENDAN ( cont 'd ) I set out to know who put her in the spot , who put her in front of the gun . That was you , angel . <p> # LAURA # ( drifting back further ) What are you talking about ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you want the whole tale ? You want me to tell it to you ? <p> # LAURA # ( bewildered ) Tell it to me . <p> # BRENDAN # Alright , from the top . You had your fingers in Brad Bramish for appearances and to keep him buying from the Pin , who you were hooked with . Emily came to you and Brad , you saw her for what she was , an insecure little girl trying to get in . She goes on the backburner . Meanwhile maybe you 're getting bored , maybe just greedy , so when the Pin scores big with the bricks you take your shot . You hook one , take half , and cut it back to size , but you cut it bad . Maybe accidentally , maybe to down the Pin 's operation , does n't matter . You put it back , but poor Frisco doses off it and lands in a coma . ( voice strengthening ) So now the Pin 's fuming , maybe he 's jealous of Brad , so he comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scape . You know trouble . There 's going to be a war over this . And there 's Emily . She trusts you . She wants in . It 's duck soup . <p> # LAURA # ( murmurs ) No . <p> # BRENDAN # You frame her for the bad brick , then you cut her loose . You turn on your heel and bite her in the throat . Last week on the payphone , Pico and Alexander , she saw something she was scared of . Tug 's car driving by , the Pin driving , but she would n't have seen the Pin . No , she was across the street , angel . She saw the passenger side . She saw you . She saw you and ran like she saw some devil . <p> Laura 's face is very still , quivering . <p> 107 <p> # LAURA # Brendan , why are you- <p> # BRENDAN # And she took the hit . Dode hid her away , but the Pin was on to her , tracked her down , told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gave her a time , and a place . And sent Tug . Just to get the straight . But maybe you had talked Tug up , or maybe he just blew a fuse , but Em sprung it on him that she had her kid , and he did what anyone could count on Tug doing - he hit her . She took the hit for you . You let her take it . <p> # LAURA # Stop it ! <p> # BRENDAN # That 's the tale . <p> # LAURA # Stop it ! <p> # BRENDAN # You 're going to tell me it 's not ? <p> # LAURA # It 's not ! <p> # BRENDAN # Look at me . <p> She crumples against him , looking him straight in the eye . <p> # LAURA # You know me . I 've only helped you . How can you - It is n't true ! <p> She sobs through a tensed , straight face . Brendan holds her stare , but his eyes are distant . <p> # BRENDAN # I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been on my side all along , not just trying to get me under your thumb like Brad and the Pin and Tug . <p> # LAURA # No- <p> 108 <p> # BRENDAN # But I think you knew that meeting was going to blow up . I think that was your final play . But I hope I 'm wrong . I hope everything I wrote in the note I dropped at Gary Trueman 's office this morning is wrong . About your and Brad 's involvement in the Pin 's runnings . I hope you did n't steal the brick last night . In your purse . <p> # LAURA # ( breathes ) I did n't . <p> # BRENDAN # That 's good . That means you did n't let me walk into a slaughterhouse . You did n't lead Tug and the Pin and their crews to the slaughter . And when Trueman reads the note , takes my cue and searches your locker , he wo n't find a damn thing . <p> Something changes in Laura 's eyes . <p> EXT . LOCKER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laura 's locker open . From its dark interior the chalky white brick falls out , spins through the air , and shatters silently on the locker cage floor . <p> EXT . BASKETBALL FIELD - SAME <p> A moment of silence between them . The basketball nets jangle . <p> Laura steps back . She looks as if she has been punched in the face . <p> # LAURA # ( murmurs ) Brendan ... do n't ... <p> # BRENDAN # ( gently ) It 's done . <p> Her face does strange things , subtle contortions . <p> She watches his eyes . He does n't look at her . Her voice shakes . <p> 109 <p> # LAURA # Done . Well . That 's most of it . 9 out of 10 . I told Em to tell Tug it was his . Told her it would soften him up . She said she wished she could keep it , but she did n't love the father . I was going to drive her down the next day , we 'd found a doctor . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . You know whose kid that makes it , or have you known all along ? <p> Slowly , steadily , she straightens up . Her figure takes back some dignity . She steps towards him deliberately . Closer . Right up against him . <p> She brings her head to his , puts her lips to his ear , breathes warm breath , and says two words . The first is <p> LAURA ( cont 'd ) Mother- <p> the second is low , guttural and lost to the whistling wind . <p> She turns and walks briskly away . <p> Brendan watches her go across the dark , barren field of asphalt . <p> Metal jangles . Brendan turns to see the Brain hopping a chain link fence . Brendan turns his eyes back on Laura . <p> # BRENDAN # You get your straight ? <p> # THE BRAIN # Yeah . I would n't have- <p> # BRENDAN # S'alright . <p> # THE BRAIN # Yeah , well . Chuck Burns came to . The knife guy . Spilled it all to the bulls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a grudge thing . <p> # BRENDAN # ( nods slightly ) Fits . You did good , Brain . Go sleep . <p> # THE BRAIN # Yeah , you too . <p> 110 <p> The Brain starts to walk away , but turns back . <p> THE BRAIN ( cont 'd ) What 'd she whisper to you ? <p> # BRENDAN # She called me a dirty word . <p> # THE BRAIN # Alright , you do n't have to tell me . Thick . <p> # BRENDAN # As what-all . Brendan stands alone on the asphalt field , watching Laura until she reaches the end of the field and walks off behind a twisted chain linked fence . <p> The first period bell rings , and Brendan walks back towards campus . <p> FADE OUT
