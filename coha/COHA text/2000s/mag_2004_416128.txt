A 20-plus-year resident of Richmond 's energetic Fan District , James Stutts took the plunge into Virginia country life with his wife , Elizabeth . " The dogs and I spent most evenings at the barn , so having horses at home leaves more time to spend with James , " Elizabeth says . Not that he 's complaining . " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envisioned a country home , and with Elizabeth , the circumstances were just right , " he says . Persistence Pays Off Appreciating the qualities of their home in the historic Fan , the couple intended to find an existing older house to renovate . They started looking in nearby Goochland County where Elizabeth has ridden for many years . With the county 's reputation as a premier horse community , the ideal spot was hard to find . Frustration drove Elizabeth to the county tax assessor 's office . " I started calling owners with big parcels of land to see if they might be interested in selling a portion , " she says . She finally hit pay dirt or , more accurately , Virginia clay . Location , Location , Location Pristine best describes the Stuttses ' property , an expanse of rolling pasture and hardwoods . With only a fence on the property , the couple had to start from scratch . " The lay of the land dictated a few locations that made sense for a horse farm , " says Elizabeth . The choices were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a site for the house with great views and trees in mind . The back of the house is as inviting and architecturally interesting as the front . Both sides focus on outdoor living spaces . " We wanted to marry the terraces and porches with the surrounding landscape , " says architect Jay Hugo . " There 's even a second-story porch specially designed for stargazing . " Photograph above : Well-placed prints and paintings enhance the stairway and hall , above , left : A refurbished carriage house door slides on a track for a stylish entrance to the study . // Making the New Feel Old To honor the country setting , the Stuttses included salvaged items such as the stairway newel post and heart-pine mantel and beams , which give the house a rustic patina . They combined ideas from books , their travels , and trips to Richmond 's salvage venue , Caravati 's . Some personal history is part of the mix . An old pine post near the dining room is from a warehouse owned by James 's brother , and the front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , new pieces were painted and finished to look aged . Green primer rubbed into the nooks and crannies of fir doors , then wiped off and sanded , creates instant age . New hardware , selected for its rustlike finish , mixes perfectly with Elizabeth 's authentic finds .

The couple 's eclectic collection looks perfectly at home . " We 're very comfortable with a mix of furnishings , " says Elizabeth . Art , a shared passion , is abun1 dant throughout the house . The stairway resembles a viewing gallery . Happily Ever After It 's hard to believe this tale could be any brighter , but it just gets better .
