Why would anyone looking for the health benefits of red wine choose a little pill over a nice glass of Pinot Noir ? Well , calorie counters or teetotalers might . At least that 's what the makers of a bumper crop of new red-wine pills are banking on . The latest entry in the burgeoning wine-supplement market is Longevinex , which boasts that its pills are the only ones that both come in airtight capsules and  --  mon Dieu !  --  are made of real red-wine extract from France . Packed into each Longevinex capsule is an active ingredient roughly equivalent to between 5 and 15 glasses of red wine or unfermented grape juice . The key compound is an antioxidant called resveratrol , which has been shown to play a role in longevity  --  at least for one-cell organisms . Perhaps time and further research will tell whether the benefits of wine , if not the pleasure and bouquet , can be packed into a pill for people . Meanwhile , which pill will pair best with foie gras ?  --  D.B.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
