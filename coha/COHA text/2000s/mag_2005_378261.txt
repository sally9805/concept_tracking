Low lives recounted in high style . That has become the sensational British movie genre of our times . Think I 'll Sleep When I 'm Dead . Or Sexy Beast . Or Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels . The newest , Layer Cake , is among the best of this mutt breed  --  undistinguished bloodlines that have somehow produced a sleek , fast-moving movie creature . <P> Layer Cake features , yes , an antihero with no name and no backstory . He 's simply called XXXX in the credits , and he 's played by a gelid Daniel Craig . He is a ) a drug dealer and b ) a man who , having made his pile , wishes to abandon his life of crime and start hanging about at posh country clubs . But prosperous as he is , he is still only middle management in the criminal pastry shop . He has obligations to his masters , chief of which is to help them recover a vast shipment of ecstasy pills that have gone missing somewhere between Amsterdam and London . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mostly what one observes about it is that from time to time , not-very-nice people get dead in a variety of not-very-nice ways . Having a hot steam iron pressed against the chest is perhaps not the way any of us would choose to leave this life . <P> But movies like this one are not about story . They are about  --  dare we say it ?  --  lifestyles . XXXX must occasionally venture into the darker depths of the underworld , visiting dank crack pads and scuzzy lairs where money is laundered or drugs cut for street sale . These director Matthew Vaughn presents with a glum and familiar realism . <P> This being Britain , fastidious attention is paid to class issues , even among the criminal classes . That 's especially true of XXXX , yearning to breathe more rarefied air . His apartment is done up in white-on-white style  --  chic photos on the wall , excellent Scotch on the coffee table , which is , of course , artily shot from the floor , looking up through the glass . This is , we think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What he really wants is something darker , more traditional . <P> Put simply , he wants something more along the lines of Eddie Temple 's library . Eddie 's the cherry on top of the Layer Cake , a master criminal with interests in legitimate real estate . Played with casually silky menace by Michael Gambon , he has developed a taste for opera ( The Damnation of Faust naturally comes up in his conversations ) and for rare books . We do n't know that he reads them , but , by golly , he has them  --  housed in a burnished , glowingly lighted library . You can practically feel the sweat of desire forming on our antihero 's lip when he penetrates this lair . <P> Will he complete his rise ? Or will he fall back down into the pits ? We 're not saying . What we can say is that if you can stomach its bursts of violence ( and some unpersuasive tosh about the drug world being the dominant culture of our day ) , Layer Cake is a treat  --  especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  By Richard Schickel
