Judging from the grim faces of the cashiers , clerks and butchers picketing California supermarkets , you would think we were in a deep economic slump . Golden State grocery workers are on strike for the first time in 25 years , over a plan by Kroger , Safeway and other chains to shift a bigger chunk of the cost of health care to their unionized labor force of some 70,000 . Under competitive siege from nonunion superstores like Wal-Mart , whose health packages for hourly workers are stingier , the grocery chains complain that they are paying 50% more on health coverage than they were four years ago . In full-page ads in California newspapers , they proclaim , " We simply can not pass these costs along to our customers . " <P> But passing the medical buck to staff members is n't going over well , either . Norma Perez , 30 , picketing with her three kids outside a Ralphs in North Hollywood , says that under the chain 's proposed policy , she and her husband would incur an additional $500 or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their house outside Los Angeles or putting the kids ' health at risk .

So the startling announcement last week that the American economy surged 7.2% in the third quarter  --  the most torrid rate of quarterly expansion since 1984  --  has many wondering whether this is , at last , the start of a sustained recovery that might pull workers out of their funk . Until that happens , strapped workers and the unemployed are wondering why , if the growth rate is so high , they feel so low ? <P> The impressive rise in gross domestic product ( GDP ) was fueled by strong exports , consumer spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second straight quarterly rise for a sector that 's critical to any sustainable turnaround . Corporate profits for firms in the S &; P 500 are expected to be up 20% , on average , from a year ago . And consumers continue to anchor the economy . The summer tax cuts pumped $13.7 billion into their wallets , igniting a 6.6% rise in spending . " Consumers spent aggressively on everything from cars to homes , " says economist Mark Zandi of
