Section : Nation &; World ; Cover Package Tank battles , trench warfare , a reporter in a purple bandanna <p> U.S. News correspondent Bay Fang was with opposition soldiers battling Taliban forces for the northern cities of Taloqan and Konduz . Excerpts from her diary : <p> <p> Nov. 10 3:15 p.m. : " We will now start the war . " Northern Alliance commander Mamur Hassan has a sense of the dramatic , or at least the telegenic , as he stands atop Chagatai hill in defiance of Taliban snipers . Above him , two vapor trails from U.S. jets swirl in messy circles across the blue sky , like a child 's painting . As he speaks , his son , Ataullah , himself a commander at 20 , captures the moment on home video . <p> On cue , a tank opens fire on distant Taliban positions with a sudden blast . For an hour , shells whiz back and forth over my head , which I keep low , pressed hard against the crumbling mud walls of a trench . I cover my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muslim country  --  with a white scarf in hopes that it will protect me from becoming a sniper 's target by blending into the landscape , and I struggle to distinguish between the whistle of incoming fire and the pop of outgoing rounds . Smoke rises from the trench opposite . A radio call : " Our mujahideen are capturing that post . Do not shoot ! " The fading sunlight casts long , low shadows . A line of Northern Alliance soldiers in crisp new uniforms follows a tank up a hillside toward Taliban positions . <p> Some 12 hours earlier , I had hitched a ride on the back of an armored personnel carrier headed to the front lines . We roared through villages of crumbling mud-brick huts ; the lights from the tanks behind us illuminated the silhouettes of villagers watching the parade . Sparks from the engines flew past me . The night was bright with stars as we rumbled toward war . <p> Nov. 11 Nasir , a young soldier , is eager to show off his find . He takes a watch from his vest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hours after the start of the Northern Alliance assault yesterday . " I shot him in the chest , " Nasir says , mimicking the sound of two gunshots  --  " Ta ! Ta ! "  --  as he grins and gestures with his Kalashnikov . " We had taken the post , and I went around looking for injured Talibs to kill . I was very angry . This guy was in his trench , and when he saw me , he said something in a language I did n't understand and put up his hands as if to say , Do n't kill me . ' But I killed him . " <p> The mujahideen claim huge victories in last night 's battles . Salim , a soldier from the Mazar-e Sharif battalion , boasts of taking five Taliban posts before American bombing interrupted the advance . Next to him , three teenagers play-wrestle ; one has a radio whining Tajik love songs , another has a Kalashnikov . <p> At lunchtime , Mohammed Eisan , a tank commander , invites me to share his picnic meal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a thick beard and sad eyes , he pours water from a glass to wash my hands and calls me " sister . " He says it has been 10 years since he left behind his 1-year-old son in the care of an uncle in Konduz . " It has been impossible to talk to him because if the Taliban knew he talked to his father , they would kill him , " he says . " I call you my sister because it makes me happy to sit with you . " The commanders sit cross-legged in a circle around me . We share a mat on a dirt patch between two tanks . A tank roars by , and suddenly the world is yellow as it rains dust . " I sometimes see my child , my home , my wife in a dream , " says Eisan . As I leave , he waves both hands frantically and then runs them over his face as if in prayer . <p> Nov. 12 My friend Volker was killed last night . A 40-year-old German writer for Stern magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6:30 p.m. , just after I had left . It had been euphoric at the Chagatai post as the radio crackled with reports that the town of Taloqan had fallen . A huge cheer went up ; soldiers fired their guns in celebration . Six reporters scrambled onto an APC with Commander Bashir to watch the Taliban surrender . As it turned out , the Talibs were lying in wait and launched a grenade and gunfire . One French radio journalist was killed instantly . Three hung on and survived as the APC swung around in retreat . But Volker and a second French journalist fell off . We spent the night huddled around a radio at Commander Hassan 's house , frantically seeking help from rebel units . <p> This morning , we brought the bodies back across the Kowkcheh River , slung across the rear of an APC . When we stopped on the other side , the soldiers dumped water from a bucket to wash blood off a stretcher but did n't help with the bodies . After all , these were not their men  --  just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines last night had not been ours , I realized . But Volker was . As colleagues Heathcliff and David carefully lifted down his body , I could see that his hands were up  --  was it in surrender to the Taliban , who then shot him , or had Northern Alliance soldiers lifted them up later to get at his pockets ? When the bodies were found , they had nothing on them ; even their pants had been cut open to get at money belts . ( The bodies were transported to a hospital in Khoja Bahauddin to await an airlift home . ) <p> Back on the front lines , soldiers swagger down a mountain with huge sacks , booty from the Taliban . Habibullah , a mad , cross-eyed fighter , brandishes a large sword . " Ha ! I killed a Talib and took this from him . Take my picture . " Every hour , it seems , another province falls . Huge trucks are being loaded with weapons , ammunition , cooking pots , all captured from the Taliban , all going to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into whatever vehicles they can find to head down the road . It is time to move on . <p> Nov. 13 A soldier named Hamidullah guides us on the road to Taloqan . Open fields , abandoned villages , and , here and there , scraps of an exploded truck . This was Taliban country . We drive carefully , smack in the middle of the tank tracks , having heard that there are mines along the way . We pass a cotton field , branches covered in fluff . " Local people planted this three years ago , but they could n't pick it because it was too dangerous , " Hamidullah says . The village , freed from the Taliban yesterday , consists of a strip of destroyed mud-brick houses . Its name , Hazar Bagh , means " one thousand gardens . " <p> Just as we arrive in Taloqan , the news comes that Kabul has fallen . Gunshots ring out as Northern Alliance soldiers celebrate and test their newly acquired Taliban guns . Taloqan seems surprisingly normal for a place liberated just two days ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the first paved road I have seen in Afghanistan . But a closer look finds disturbing details : a tree decorated with long strands of audiotape , like Christmas tinsel , ripped from music cassettes by the Taliban . At a stall selling sugar , batteries , and shampoo , pictures of smiling women with lustrous hair on the shampoo ads are scratched out vigorously with pens . <p> But there is still possibly the biggest fight to go , and the rebels  --  do we still call them that after capturing the capital ?  --  are arriving to lay siege to the thousands of Talibs who have retreated to Konduz . The road toward Konduz is a sea of brown mujahideen hats as soldiers saunter toward the front line . Some go in packed trucks , some by horse-drawn carriages ornately decorated with fake roses , but most by foot , weapons hanging casually . Two young men hold hands and swing them as they walk , as if buddies on a school field trip . " We are going to fight . " " We are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , the commander holds a rally . He stands above the rows of hundreds of men , all dressed in tunics with assorted weaponry , and recites from the Koran . The men cry out , " Allah Akbar God is great . " He says , " We came down from the mountains and captured most of Afghanistan in a short time . The Taliban killed many of our people . They slashed our people 's stomachs with knives . They poured our people 's blood . Now , at this moment , they are defeated . Congratulations to all the people of Afghanistan ! " A cry goes up , " Allah Akbar ! " They head off down the road , a river of fighters surging toward the front . On one side , there is a spectacular mountain range , its foot lined with flags fluttering from the graves of martyrs . <p> Nov. 14 I wake up at 5 to go to the front line , having heard rumors that today is the day of the assault on Konduz . We fear it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrender . But the tide is coming the other way today . Children carrying tin pails , old men driving donkeys strapped down with mattresses and blankets , veiled women carrying dirty-faced babies . While most refugees have been heading home to newly freed areas , these people were just forced to flee their village by the Taliban 's ethnic cleansing . " Now , the village is the front line of the Taliban , " says Noornisa , who has pushed up her burka to reveal her creased face . She sits on the edge of the road , three of her children around her , waiting for her husband , who has only one leg and is coming by donkey . " They said we were all Tajiks and Uzbeks and were helping the Northern Alliance . They said , If you do n't leave now , we will kill all of you . ' " <p> Nov. 15 Hajji Shah Mahmud 's Restaurant is the Rick 's Cafe of Taloqan . Everyone is here : Kalashnikov-toting soldiers , refugees waiting to go home , and an international cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the end of the war . Relatives and friends run into each other and exchange the traditional greeting of a warm handshake and hug , one hand on the heart . <p> At the front line , I lie down for a midmorning nap in a hollow covered with straw . Dozens of soldiers loll around me , staring unabashedly . It has long ceased to bother me . Just as I drift off , they begin peppering me with questions . " Are you in the CIA ? " asks one hopefully . " Are there women in the CIA ? " In the background , there is a sound like the wind rushing through trees and then a series of loud cracks that echo off the mountain ridge behind us . Grinning and pointing to the sky , the soldiers shout , " AMRIKA ! " <p> A soldier offers me the sawed-off base of a rocket-propelled grenade . It is full of tea . I drink it happily , lean back on the straw in the morning sun , and , surrounded by soldiers and lulled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Northern Alliance fighters near Taloqan <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : VICTORY .
