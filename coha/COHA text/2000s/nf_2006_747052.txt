Section : CE <p> Upper extremity injuries and fractures are extremely common in children ( see Figure 1A , B , C ) . Nurses are often one of the first healthcare providers to assess a child with a fracture . Although basic fracture care and principles are used , nurses caring for these young patients must also have a good understanding of normal bone growth and development and common mechanisms of injury and fracture patterns seen in children . Although most pediatric fractures can be treated successfully with closed reduction and immobilization ( casting ) , health care providers must remain cognizant of complications that can arise . <p> In children , fractures of the upper extremity are much more common than those in the lower extremity ( Beaty &; Kasser , 2001 ) . This article discusses some of the most common upper extremity fractures in children . Common mechanisms of injury in children , fracture type and classification , and current management techniques are also reviewed . This article also enables nurses and nurse practitioners to educate parents , families , and other healthcare providers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upper Extremity Fractures Clavicle Fractures <p> Clavicle ( collarbone ) fractures are extremely common in children . The majority of clavicle fractures will heal uneventfully and without any complications by use of a simple sling and swathe . Primary indications for operative intervention in children are an open fracture , one where skin is tented or threatened , complicated comminuted fractures , or fractures with an associated neurovascular injury ( Curtis , 1990 ) . Most pediatric orthopaedic surgeons agree that it is better to accept angulation and deformity than to attempt open reduction . The operative scar from an open reduction is often more displeasing to the patient/parents than the bony prominence of a malunited fracture ( Herring . 2002 ) . Common mechanisms of injury include a fall on an outstretched hand , fall onto the shoulder , or direct trauma to the bone . The physical examination usually yields point tenderness directly over the fracture site . There is often bruising , swelling , and grinding ( crepitus ) that is easy to palpate , given the subcutaneous position of the bone ( Eiff &; Hatch , 2003 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the body and support it with the opposite hand . Most fractures of the clavicle ( 80% ) occur in the middle one-third of the bone , another 15% involve the distal one-third , and 5% involve the proximal one-third . An anteroposterior x-ray of the clavicle is the radiograph of choice to accurately diagnose most clavicle fractures ( see Figure 2A ) . <p> Traditionally , clavicle fractures were treated with a figure of eight braces in children . These braces were seldom worn correctly and were often uncomfortable for the patient . Most pediatric orthopaedic surgeons will now place the patient in a simple sling for 2-3 weeks or until comfortable ( Staheli , 2001 ) . Follow-up radiographs should generally be obtained at approximately 4-6 weeks ( see Figure 2B ) , and contact sports and activities are restricted for approximately 2-3 weeks following clinical and radio-graphic healing ( often 3-4 months ) . Due to abundant callus formation , clavicle fractures usually heal with a palpable and visible bump . This is especially true in very young patients with rapid formation of callus at the fracture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the healing callus or bump is the initial finding in young patients with clavicle fractures . This is especially true with neonatal clavicle fractures ( birth fracture ) where healing is initiated just days after injury or trauma . Neonatal clavicle fractures , in general , are more common for gestational age newborns ( &gt;4,500g ) , especially when there has been a difficult delivery or shoulder dystocia ( Eiff &; Hatch , 2003 ) . Newborns will often present with a pseudoparalysis ( inability to actively move the limb ) of the upper extremity . When the newborn is not moving the affected upper extremity spontaneously , providers must also assess for possible injury to the brachial plexus ( Erb 's palsy ) . Neonatal clavicular fractures often can be treated by pinning the sleeve of the affected side ( with the elbow at approximately 90 degrees ) to the infants ' shin ( Onsie ) to minimize movement , Neonatal clavicle fractures will usually heal rapidly , and the infant should begin to spontaneously use and move the arm within 1-2 weeks . To avoid anxiety , parents should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initial examination and visit . The callus bump will become less distinct as the bone remodels over the next 6-12 months . Complications with pediatric clavicle fractures are rare . Proximal Humerus Fracture <p> Proximal humerus fractures are also a very common injury in children and adolescents . This type of fracture should be the first diagnosis considered in injuries to the shoulder in children between the ages of 9 and 15 years ( Herring , 2002 ) . Although less common than clavicle fractures , this fracture also can be seen as a birth-related injury in newborns . The physis ( growth plate ) of the proximal humerus has an extraordinary ability to remodel . This primarily results from the significant growth that comes from the proximal physis . The majority of the proximal humerus fractures in children can and should be treated nonsurgically . Reduction is only needed in patients near skeletal maturity whose fracture has more than 50-70 degrees of angulation in either the sagittal or coronal plane ( Rab &; Grottkau , 2001 ) . The most common mechanism of injury is a fall or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveals point tenderness over the proximal humerus and pain with shoulder abduction and rotation , as well as swelling and ecchymosis at the fracture site . Antero-posterior and lateral X-rays of the shoulder should be obtained to confirm a fracture of the proximal humerus ( see Figure 4A and B ) . It is important that all providers carefully assess the function of the axillary nerve with this fracture . Because of its close proximity to the proximal humerus , this nerve is susceptible to injury with this fracture . The axillary nerve provides innervation to the deltoid muscle and cutaneous sensory function over the lateral aspect of the deltoid cuff ( Kwon &; Sarwark , 2001 ) . A quick assessment of the axillary nerve can be done by gently testing the deltoid function and sensation over the lateral aspect of the proximal humerus . To provide comfort and prevent further injury , the child should be immobilized in a simple sling for approximately 3-4 weeks . Gentle pendulum exercises and shoulder range motion exercises can usually be started in the second week . Similar to clavicle fractures , proximal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are associated neurovascular injuries , open and/or intra-articular fractures , or severely angulated fractures in the older child and adolescent . Complications following proximal humerus fractures in children are also quite rare . Humeral shaft ( diaphysis ) and scapula fractures are uncommon injuries in children and , in the absence of significant trauma ( motor vehicle accident , fall from height ) , should raise suspicion for possible nonaccidental trauma ( child abuse ) . Elbow Fractures <p> Fractures of the elbow are also quite common in children , representing approximately 10-12% of all pediatric fractures ( Herring , 2002 ; Tamai et al , 2002 ) . The unique anatomy of the elbow , combined with the complex treatment that is often required , and the potential for complications require prompt diagnosis and referral by all pediatric healthcare providers . Diagnoses of elbow fractures in the immature skeleton are some of the most challenging diagnoses to make . Unlike fractures of the clavicle and proximal humerus , elbow fractures are more likely to require precise , often surgical , reduction . <p> One frequent source of problem in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six normal secondary ossification centers . The immature pediatric elbow predominantly consists of cartilage that adds to the difficulty of radiographic assessment . In the newborn , nearly the entire elbow joint is cartilaginous ( nonossified ) and , therefore , not visible on radiographs . The mnemonic CRMTOL is often used to remember the appearance of secondary centers of ossification at the elbow ( Table 1 ) ( see Figure 5 ) . <p> In general , the ossification of these growth centers occurs at approximately 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , and 11 years of age ( Green , 1994 ; Kwon &; Sarwark , 2001 ) . It is important to keep in mind that these ages may vary and often occur somewhat earlier in girls . Knowing this sequence can help pediatric providers distinguish a fracture from a normal finding in the elbow . Supracondylar Fractures <p> Supracondylar fractures of the humerus are the most common and one of the most challenging elbow fractures in children . Approximately 60-80% of all pediatric elbow fractures occur at the Supracondylar region of the humerus ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Bealy , 2001 ) . This type of humerus fracture has the highest complication rate of any pediatric fracture ( Rab &; Grottkau , 2001 ) . They occur most often during the first decade of life and have a peak incidence in children who are 5-7 years of age ( Sponseller , 2002 ) . The anatomy of the distal humerus in children is quite complex and is the topic of numerous papers , research studies , and discussions among pediatric orthopaedic surgeons . The vast majority of these fractures occur in the first decade of life because of the increased incidence of falls , generalized ligamentous laxity , and weakness in the bony architecture at the Supracondylar area of the humerus . The presence of the olecranon fossa ( see Figure 7 ) in the metaphysis of the distal humerus has been shown to decrease the resistance to tensile failure in pediatric immature metaphyseal bone leading to the increased incidence of fractures . <p> The most common mechanism of injury is a fall on an outstretched upper extremity ( hyperextension ) . During the fall , the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fossa , causing a fracture . The distal fragment of the fracture is usually posteriorly displaced . In a normal elbow , a line drawn along the anterior cortex of the humerus should bisect the capitellum . In a supracondylar fracture , the capitellum is generally posterior to this line . Supracondylar fractures are classified on the basis of the degree of displacement . Gartland 's 1959 classification has continued to be widely used , with Type I being nondisplaced , Type II partially displaced with the posterior periosteal hinge intact , and Type III completely displaced ( no contact between fracture fragments ) ( see Figure 8A-C ) . <p> Owing to the neurovascular injuries that can be associated with this fracture , as well as the relatively high rates of malunion , supracondylar elbow fractures often have a notorious reputation ( Skaggs , Hammond , &; Kay , 1998 ) . Several important nerves and vessels surround the elbow and can sustain injury from a supracondylar fracture . In Type III fractures ( completely displaced ) , these neurovascular structures can be injured against the sharp edges of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B ) . This type of elbow fracture has the potential to injure the brachial artery , as well as the radial , median , and/or ulnar nerve . Therefore , it is important to ensure that all patients with a suspected or known supracondylar fracture receive a thorough neurovascular assessment . <p> Assessing a young child with a supracondylar elbow fracture can be quite challenging . There is often extensive swelling and pain with this fracture ( see Figure 10 A &; B ) , and the child may be quite fearful during any examination . A nurses presence and reassurance can often assist in easing this anxiety and help to facilitate this important initial examination . The fractured bone might be tenting or puckering the skin , indicating an urgent need for reduction so that the affected skin does not necrose . The brachial and/or radial pulse should be assessed to ensure that there is no vascular injury . A white and/or cool hand usually indicates arterial compromise and the need for an urgent reduction of the fracture . Owing to the extensive swelling that can be seen with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for possible compartment syndrome . Compartment syndrome results from increased pressure ( swelling ) in a fascial compartment containing muscle . The pressure and swelling can be so great that blood How is blocked from entering the muscle causing necrosis ( death ) of muscles and nerves if left untreated ( Table 2 ) ( Grottkau , Epps , &; DiScala , 2005 ) . A characteristic physical finding with compartment syndrome is exaggeration of pain upon mild extension or stretch of the fingers ( Bae , Kadiyala , &; Waters , 2001 ) . Paresthesias and numbness indicate increased edema and tissue pressure , whereas pallor reflects decreased oxygen to tissues ( Maher , 2002 ) . Circulation should be frequently assessed by pulse , capillary refill , color , temperature , muscle strength , and pain on passive stretch of the digits . A thorough assessment of motor and sensory function should be done on all patients with a suspected or known elbow fracture . The patient is asked to perform a " thumbs up " sign to confirm radial nerve function . The patient should also make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The anterior interosseous nerve ( branching from the median nerve ) is assessed by having the child make an " ok sign " approximating the thumb and index finger and testing for strength ( Skaggs , 1998 ) ( Table 2 ) . Treatment of Supracondylar Fractures <p> Most Type I supracondylar humerus fractures ( nondisplaced ) can be treated nonsurgically in a long-arm cast for approximately 3-4 weeks . The elbow is usually held in approximately 90-110 degrees of flexion unless the swelling of the extremity precludes this . Although more severely displaced fractures also may be treated with closed reduction and a cast , the incidence of vascular problems and late malposition increases significantly . Therefore , most Type II and Type III fractures are currently treated with closed reduction and percutaneous pin fixation ( see Figure 11A &; B ) . The main criteria in deciding to treat this fracture nonoperatively are the absence of rotational deformity or medial comminution and the ability to hold the reduction with 100-120 degrees of elbow flexion ( Lawson &; Milbrandt , 2004 ) . <p> Reduction of a supracondylar fracture is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consist of longitudinal traction/countertraction to bring the fracture into apposition . After the fracture is reduced , percutaneous Kirchner-wires will usually be placed to hold the position . In general , two 0.062 inch K-wires are placed from the lateral side , across the fracture site , engaging the medial cortex of the proximal fracture fragment ( Skaggs , 1997 ) . After the fracture is reduced and the K-wires have been placed , the surgeon cuts and bends the wires outside the skin . A long-arm cast is then applied with the elbow in approximately 70-80 degrees of flexion , The long-arm cast is frequently bivalved or split to allow for expected swelling postoperatively . If the fracture can not be reduced with closed reduction , an open reduction may be necessary . Although in the past , open reduction was believed to lead to increased stiffness , recent studies have shown that 94% of patients lose less than 15 degrees of motion compared with the contralateral side ( Sponseller , 2002 ) . <p> The nurse must continue to assess the neurovascular status of the upper extremity following surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about heart level and the fingers above the elbow . The patients fingers should he warm , pink , and permit passive flexion and extension without undue pain . Nurses should ensure that sensation is intact to light touch distally especially in the early postoperative period . The parents should also be taught to assess the neurovascular status , as well as care of the skin under and around the cast edges . They should be instructed to return immediately either to the orthopaedic office or to the emergency department if it appears that the splint or cast is becoming too tight or if the pain seems to be inappropriately increasing ( Herring , 2002 ) . <p> Approximately 3 weeks after surgery , the cast and K-wires are removed in the office and the child is permitted to resume most activities . Although many children are anxious about pin removal , the nurse should reassure the patient and parents that it should not be a painful procedure . Providing continued reassurance and comfort to the child and parent can be immensely helpful during this initial follow-up visit ( see Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months postoperatively to ensure that the range of motion has been restored and to obtain X-rays of the elbow . <p> Although rare , there are many complications that can be seen with supracondylar fractures of the elbow . Vascular injury occurs in approximately 2.5% of Type III fractures ( usually brachial artery injury ) , and neural impairment can occur in approximately 17% ( Gosens &; Bongers , 2003 ) . Compartment syndrome is also a possibility although it has become an uncommon occurrence with the current treatment protocol ( Bae et al , 2001 ; Battaglia , Armstrong , &; Schwend , 2002 ) . The most disabling neurovascular complication of a supracondylar fracture is Volkmann 's ischemia . This condition was more common when displaced fractures were treated nonoperatively with a cast in hyperflexion . The extensive swelling seen in these fractures coupled with a restrictive cast ( especially II in hyperflexion ) has the potential to cause permanent vascular and nerve damage . A Volkmann 's ischemia usually causes severe fixed contractures of the entire upper extremity from the elbow to the fingers . Fortunately , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neuropraxia ( stretch on the nerve ) that will generally spontaneously resolve with observation ( Otsuka &; Kasser , 1997 ) . Exploration and neurolysis are only indicated in patients who have no improvement on clinical examination and/or electromyography at 5-6 months following injury . Potential complications from the percutaneous pinning procedure include pin tract inflammation or infection , osteomyelitis , iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury ( from the pin ) , and loss of reduction ( Skaggs et al. , 2001 ; Webb &; Sherman , 1989 ) . <p> Cubitus varus ( also called gunstock deformity ) is the most common angular deformity following a supracondylar fracture . It is usually caused by an incomplete or loss of reduction and has become increasingly rare now that these fractures are typically reduced and pinned if they are displaced . The deformity will become noticeable after the child regains full extension of the elbow . Although a supracondylar malunion may be unsightly , studies have shown that it causes no proven functional deficit ( Sponseller , 2002 ) . If surgical correction is desired , it is usually delayed until the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fracture <p> Numerous studies have shown the radius to be the most commonly injured long bone in the pediatric population ( Wilkins , 2001 ) . The most common mechanism of injury is a fall on an outstretched wrist/hand . With the increase in sports and activities , the incidence of pediatric distal forearm fractures has increased approximately 40% over the last 30 years ( Khosla et al. , 2004 ) . On examination , a child with a distal radius fracture usually has pain , swelling , and/or deformity at the wrist . A child with a displaced distal radius/ulna fracture ( see Figure 13A &; B ) will usually be taken to the emergency department immediately after injury , whereas a child with a buckle fracture may come to the pediatricians ' office a few days after injury with mild wrist pain . If a fracture is suspected , anteroposterior and lateral views of the wrist should be obtained . It is important to determine the type of fracture and the amount of displacement to ensure that proper treatment is given . Fractures of the distal radius are often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torus ) , greenstick , complete ( transverse ) , comminuted ( multiple pieces ) , or physeal ( Salter Harris I-V ) . <p> Buckle ( torus ) fractures are very common at the distal radius and can often be managed in a primary care setting . Buckle fractures of the distal radius are usually treated with a short-arm cast or splint for 3-4 weeks in children . They are stable fractures and treated mainly for the associated discomfort . The cast is removed after 3-4 weeks , and the child can then resume activities and sports without restrictions . A removable volar wrist splint is also an acceptable alternative to the short-arm cast although pediatric providers know that the splint is very difficult to keep on an active child and is often quickly discarded ( Solan , Rees , &; Daly , 2002 ) . Follow-up X-rays are not required in distal radius buckle fractures unless there is persistent pain on examination . Nondisplaced fractures of the distal radius can be also treated with a short-arm cast for 3-6 weeks depending on the child 's age and the type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential for associated fractures of the distal ulna that may require a long-arm cast and a longer period of immobilization ( sec Figure 14 ) . A thorough examination of the hand and elbow should always be done to assess for other fractures or injuries ( e.g. , scaphoid fractures and supracondylar elbow fractures ) . In addition , a thorough neurovascular exam should be done to assess for injuries to the median , ulnar , or radial nerve . Similar to elbow fractures , a displaced fracture of the distal radius and/or ulna can cause significant swelling , and providers must assess for a possible compartment syndrome . A compartment syndrome is more likely in a fracture that requires repeated manipulations during reduction or when there has been an extensive soft ( issue trauma at the wrist ( Grottkau et al , 2005 ) . Also similar to elbow fractures , percutaneous pins are occasionally needed to stabilize the fracture during healing ( see Figure 15 ) . <p> A distal radius fracture that involves the physis ( growth plate ) generally should be referred to a pediatric orthopaedic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physis is the most commonly injured physis in the body ( Waters , 2002 ) . As described in Part I of ( he series , nondisplaced Salter Harris I fractures are usually not seen on plain radiographs and should be assumed in a skeletally immature patient with tenderness at the physis ( growth plate ) . A Salter Hams Type II ( metaphysis into the physis ) pattern is the most frequent type of physeal injury of the distal radius . Displacement of the fracture is most often dorsal with apex volar angulation . Distal radius fractures involving the physis usually require closed reduction ( if displaced ) and long-arm casting for approximately 6 weeks ( see Figure 16 ) . The most significant complication of any growth plate fracture is a subsequent growth arrest . Growth arrest of the distal physis is related to two factors : the amount of initial trauma affecting the physis and iatrogenic injury ( Waters , 2002 ) . Iatrogenic injury with physeal fractures is most often caused by forceful , repeat , or open reductions . <p> Providers also must remember the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted displacement with distal radius fractures depends on the type and location of the fracture , the direction of the angular deformity , and the age of the child . Rotational deformities will not remodel and usually need to be corrected via closed/open reduction . Remodeling of an angular deformity al the distal radius may be as much as 10 degrees per year in children with open physes ( Waters , 2002 ) . In general , younger children with fractures that are closer to the physis have a greater potential than adults for remodeling and correcting residual angulation . As a general principle , angulation of up to 25-30 degrees can be accepted in children less than 10 years of age with a Salter Hams I or II fracture and up to 12-15 degrees of angulation can be accepted in children greater than 10 years of age ( Armstrong , Joughlin , &; Clarke , 1994 ) . Finger/Hand Fractures ( Metacarpal , Scaphoid , Phalanx ) <p> The hand is the most frequently injured part of the body in the pediatric and adolescent age group ( Hastings &; Simmons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kazemi , Cannon , and Courtemanche ( 2001 ) reviewed the age , gender , location , and mechanism of injury in pediatric hand fractures . This study revealed an increased incidence in male ( 75% ) , with a peak incidence occurring at 11 3.3 years ( Mahabir et al . ) . Sports activities and direct trauma ( crush injuries ) were the most common causes in both sexes . Approximately 40% of finger fractures involve the growth plate , with 90% being classified as a Salter-Harris II fracture ( Mahabir et al . ) . <p> The fifth metacarpal and phalanx are the most frequently injured hand bones ( see Figure 17 ) . A common injury to the fifth metacarpal neck is known as a Boxer 's fracture ( see Figure 18 ) . This injury usually occurs from hyperflexion of the fifth metacarpal neck usually due to punching or hitting an object or wall . Providers need to carefully assess for any evidence of an open fracture or break in the skin . This is especially true when the boxer 's fracture is from hitting another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high association of secondary infection . <p> Most hand and finger fractures in children and adolescents can be treated with closed reduction and immobilization in a cast . It is often easier to use a cast rather than splints in children , given the difficulty in keeping a removable splint on a young child . Fractures involving the thumb are usually treated in a thumb spica short-arm cast , and fractures involving the index finger are often treated with a radial gutter short-arm cast . Fractures involving the long , ring , and little fingers are usually treated with an ulnar gutter short-arm cast ( see Figure 19 ) . Finger and hand fractures usually heal quite rapidly in children , and immobilization is only needed for approximately 3-6 weeks . <p> The scaphoid is the most commonly injured carpal bone in both adults and children . This injury is seen most commonly in males between the age of 15 and 30 ( Light , 1988 ) . Physical examination will often reveal tenderness at the " anatomic snuff-box . " This area is bordered by the extensors and abductor tendons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It can be seen as an isolated injury or in conjunction with other injuries of the hand and wrist . Most scaphoid fractures in children are fractures of the waist or avulsions of the distal pole and heals with immobilisation/casting ( see Figure 20A &; B ) . However , providers must realize that there is a risk of nonunion and osteonecrosis with these fractures . Recently , computed tomography ( CT ) has been used to assess for healing/ displacement of these fractures . Prolonged casting ( 3-6months ) with either a short or a long thumb spica cast may be necessary . Surgical intervention may be necessary if the fracture is displaced or if there is no evidence of healing seen after 2-3 months . Conclusion <p> Fractures of the upper extremity are extremely common in the pediatric population . Having a basic understanding of these common fractures as well as the expected outcome allows nurses to give better care to the young orthopaedic patient . By offering appropriate anticipatory guidance to the patient , parent , and other Healthcare providers , the nurse or nurse practitioner can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complications can arise during the treatment and must be recognized to ensure that proper care is instituted . Treating young children and adolescents with a fracture certainly poses many challenges for healthcare providers . Facing these challenges and assisting in the direct care of these children , however , can be a truly rewarding experience for all nurses . TABLE 1 .
