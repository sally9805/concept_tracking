If you constantly swig from a bottle of water during strenuous exercise , you 're not alone . Coaches , personal trainers and doctors have long harped on the need to avoid dehydration , which can cause dizziness , fainting and , in extreme cases , brain damage or death . <P> But when a 28-year-old woman collapsed and died during the Boston Marathon three years ago , it was n't lack of water that felled her . It was too much water . A study in last week 's New England Journal of Medicine found that an alarming number of runners and other athletes are risking a similar fate . The problem is that drinking too much water dilutes the blood 's normal salt content , <P> producing a condition known as hyponatremia . The result : excess fluid is sucked from the bloodstream into cells  --  including brain cells  --  making them swell . Pressure grows inside the skull , and that can lead to permanent damage , even death . <P> The study looked at the blood of 488 runners in the 2002 Boston Marathon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hyponatremia , and three were at the danger level . The condition is most likely to strike novice runners , as lite athletes do n't want to lose seconds by slowing down at the water stations that line race routes  --  and they know from experience that they do n't have to . <P> Unfortunately , as extreme sports like marathons , long-distance bike rides and triathlons grow in popularity , the number of inexperienced athletes also keeps growing . And unless there is awareness of how dangerous excessive drinking of water can be , some endurance athletes may be at risk .
