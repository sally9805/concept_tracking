Chapter One The Roads Nanapush Fleur took the small roads , the rutted paths through the woods traversing slough edge and heavy underbrush , trackless , unmapped , unknown and always bearing east . She took the roads that the deer took , trails that had n't a name yet and stopped abruptly or petered out in useless ditch . She took the roads she had to make herself , chopping alder and flattening reeds . She crossed fields and skirted lakes , pulled her cart over farmland and pasture , heard the small clock and shift of her ancestors ' bones when she halted , spent of all but the core of her spirit . Through rain she slept beneath the cart 's bed . When the sun shone with slant warmth she rose and went on , kept walking until she came to the iron road . The road had two trails , parallel and slender . This was the path she had been looking for , the one she wanted . The man who had stolen her trees took this same way . She followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her cart and kept going on that road , taking one step and then the next step , and the next . She wore her makizinan to shreds , then stole a pair of boots off the porch of a farmhouse , strangling a fat dog to do it . She skinned the dog , boiled and ate it , leaving only the bones behind , sucked hollow . She dug cattails from the potholes and roasted the sweet root . She ate mud hens and snared muskrats , and still she traveled east . She traveled until the iron road met up with another , until the twin roads grew hot from the thunder and lightning of so many trains passing and she had to walk beside . The night before she reached the city the sky opened and it snowed . The ground was n't frozen and her fire kept her warm . She thought hard . She found a tree and under it she buried the bones and the clan markers , tied a red prayer flag to the highest branches , and then slept beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's secret name to herself , named her spirit . Four Souls , she was called . She would need the name where she was going . The next morning , Fleur pushed the cart into heavy bramble and piled brush over to hide it . She washed herself in ditch water , braided her hair , and tied the braids together in a loop that hung down her back . She put on the one dress she had that was n't ripped and torn , a quiet brown . And the heavy boots . A blanket for a shawl . Then she began to walk toward the city , carrying her bundle , thinking of the man who had taken her land and her trees . She was still following his trail . Far across the fields she could hear the city rumbling as she came near , breathing in and out like a great sleeping animal . The cold deepened . The rushing sound of wheels in slush made her dizzy , and the odor that poured , hot , from the doorways and windows and back porches caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock by the side of the road and ate the last pinch of pemmican from a sack at her waist . The familiar taste of the pounded weyass , the dried berries , nearly brought tears to her eyes . Exhaustion and longing filled her . She sang her mother 's song , low , then louder , until her heart strengthened , and when she could feel her dead around her , gathering , she straightened her back . She kept on going , passed into the first whitened streets and on into the swirling heart of horns and traffic . The movement of mechanical , random things sickened her . The buildings upon buildings piled together shocked her eyes . The strange lack of plant growth confused her . The people stared through her as though she were invisible until she thought she was , and walked more easily then , just a cloud reflected in a stream . Below the heart of the city , where the stomach would be , strange meadows opened made of stuff clipped and green . For a long while she stood before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder at its square shape , amazed that it should grow in so unusual a fashion , its twigs gnarled in smooth planes . She looked up into the bank of stone walls , of brick houses and wooden curlicued porches that towered farther uphill . In the white distance one mansion shimmered , light glancing bold off its blank windowpanes and turrets and painted rails . Fleur blinked and passed her hand across her eyes . But then , behind the warm shadow of her fingers , she recovered her inner sight and slowly across her face there passed a haunted , white , wolf grin . * * * Sometimes an old man does n't know how he knows things . He ca n't remember where knowledge came from . Sometimes it is clear . Fleur told me all about this part of her life some years after she lived it . For the rest , though , my long talks with Father Damien resulted in a history of the great house that Fleur grinned up at that day . I pieced together the story of how it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benches set against my little house , or at a slow fire , or even inside at the table carefully arranged on the linoleum floor over which Margaret got so particular . During those long conversations Father Damien and I exchanged rumors , word , and speculation about Fleur 's life and about the great house where she went . What else did we have to talk about ? The snow fell deep . The same people lived in the same old shacks here . Over endless games of cards or chess we amused ourselves by wondering about Fleur Pillager . For instance , we guessed that she followed her trees and , from that , we grew convinced that she was determined to cut down the man who took them . She had lived among those oak and pine trees when their roots grew deep beneath her and their leaves thick above . Continues ...
