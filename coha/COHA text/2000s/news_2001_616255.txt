<p> For little Thomas and Grace Ellen Bowey , the dramas of this day include kicking a ball around , flying high on the swings and swatting away mosquitoes in the park . <p> But Thomas , 7 , and Grace Ellen , 4  --  the centers of a bizarre international custody battle  --  have seen more than their share of suspenseful events this past year . <p> Two weeks have passed since the most recent , and perhaps final , chapter closed on the Bowey vs . Bowey custody case . Andrew Bowey , once charged as a kidnapper , obtained custody of his two children and brought them back from France to their Cobb County home on July 2 . <p> " I tuck them in bed every night , " said the 45-year-old father . " I sing them to sleep . " <p> So far , so good . <p> But the 45-year-old father worries there will be tough times ahead . He has been through a lot , and so have the kids . Nobody comes through divorce unscathed , especially this divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international custody fights occurring in our ever-shrinking global society . As more people do business abroad , relationships start . And just as happens in domestic relationships , sometimes they fall to pieces in divorce . <p> But custody battles become tougher when parents are an ocean apart . When one spouse heads overseas with a child , the distance and the difference in two nations ' laws can make legally reclaiming that child difficult , legal experts say . <p> " You have to travel . You have to hire a lawyer in another country . You have to put up with our legal system , and the other country 's legal system , " said Peter Lauzon , a Los Angeles attorney with 10 years ' experience in international custody cases . " It 's terribly expensive . " <p> Moreover , jostling children from country to country can take a toll on them . When they do settle down , they can bring some hefty emotional baggage from their journey . <p> " It 's more than just being shifted back and forth from one house to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the emotional strength of the child . " They 're taken from the sociey and the culture that they truly understand . It 's a double whammy . " <p> Thomas , a sandy-haired boy who loves soccer , and Grace Ellen , a girl with an affinity for Barbie dolls and cellphones , have been wrenched back and forth between their Mableton home and a village in France . They have seen the inside of courtrooms , and along the way , they have seen that mommies and daddies sometimes despise each other . <p> But now they 're back home with their old toys and their old friends . Their father says he wants their lives to be normal again . He has taken Grace Ellen for her preschool shots for mumps and measles and he 's registering Thomas for school in the fall . <p> But even now , Bowey discusses little of what has happened . They do n't talk about the times when things got nasty , when Bowey branded his wife , Frederique , as emotionally unstable , or when she accused him of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks of Frederique at all . <p> " They love their mother , " Bowey said . " They feel caught in the middle . " <p> Meanwhile their mother remains an ocean away . The kids talk to her almost daily over the phone . Their father has explained they will visit her . He plans to have the children compile a little newsletter for their mother , filled with news of their doings and pictures they 've drawn . <p> " I 'm very , very happy , " Bowey said , " and very , very nervous . " <p> After all , chaos has interceded too often this past year . <p> After six years of marriage in their Mableton home , Frederique Bowey took off with the two children to France last August . Five months later , Andrew Bowey spirited them back . Frederique responded by filing kidnapping charges against him with the French authorities . For proof , she noted that Bowey 's name is not on the boy 's birth certificate . <p> On Feb. 1 , Bowey was confronted by a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he dropped Thomas off at Nickajack Elementary School in Mableton . Thomas watched as his father was thrown to the ground , handcuffed and dragged away . Grace Ellen was taken from the car . <p> Frederique subsequently took the children back to France . <p> Bowey spent some 22 days in a Fulton County jail and weeks under house arrest awaiting a hearing to extradite him to France , where he faced the prospect of a 30-year prison sentence . Three days before his May hearing , the U.S. Attorney 's Office in Atlanta announced it would not honor the French request to send him there . <p> In the interim , Bowey filed for divorce in a Cobb County court . When Frederique failed to return from France for the hearings , he was granted custody of the children . <p> In May , he flew to France to fight the criminal charge , and to fight for custody of his kids . A French family court judge upheld the Cobb County decision granting him custody . Also , he said , the French criminal authorities have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of July . <p> Though his children are back in his arms , Bowey is still afraid that , despite convincing courts here and in France that he is the legitimate father of Thomas  --  Grace Ellen was never in question  --  the tables will somehow turn . <p> Too often , trouble has stepped in just as things started going his way . After the French judge upheld his right to custody of the children , he went to receive them from Frederique . There was a house full of people , several of them blocking the way out , Bowey said . <p> Drumming up his nerve , Bowey snatched up a child in each arm and elbowed his way out the door , he said . <p> Then there was the plane ride home from France . Thomas was sick with a fever . The boy threw up . Exiting the plane , Bowey noticed that the line of people was moving very slowly . At the plane door , a man with a badge and a sidearm checked their customs papers , told them without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his children , the father got scared . <p> " This is America . I have a right to know , " Bowey recalled telling him . <p> Be quiet , the man said . <p> " You ca n't take my children away from me . You have to tell me what 's going on . I have custody orders . Passports . What 's wrong ? " he said , his fear turning to tears . <p> Some 45 minutes passed before the children were returned to him . As it turns out , the scene was , to a degree , his doing . Months earlier , Bowey had listed the children with the National Crime Information Center , so that airports would be alerted should they come into the United States . Essentially , he caught himself . <p> To this day , Bowey and Frederique continue their battles . Frederique , who could not be reached for comment in France , has filed an appeal to the divorce decree issued in Cobb County , asserting that she was never properly notified . Bowey says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal fees are hefty . He 's planning to sell the house , which he built himself from the ground up . Once again , the children must be uprooted . <p> He 's bracing them for it . <p> " We 're going to go through the house , " Bowey said . " We 're going to pick out what we take , and what we leave behind . " Home in Cobb County , Andrew Bowey has custody of Grace Ellen and Thomas after beating French charges that he kidnapped them . / JOHN SPINK / Staff
