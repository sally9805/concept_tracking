Section : Lending Microcredit is booming in India , but the loans do n't often pull people out of poverty <p> In the K.R. Puram slum in Bangalore , India , a group of 15 women gather in a small , muggy living room . The electricity comes and goes , turning the fan and the single bare lightbulb on and off . Flies buzz around the room , and children run in and out . <p> The women have borrowed $330 and meet weekly to make repayments . The loans were meant to serve as capital for them to start small businesses and , eventually , lift themselves out of poverty . But the women say the loans have n't turned into new income . Sitting in a circle on the floor , some sound sad and others angry . One woman has started selling firewood , but others have n't started businesses at all . Instead , they say , the money helped them pay for urgent expenses , such as their children 's school fees . <p> It 's a scene that 's repeated inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boosted by a government mandate to keep the startup funds flowing , lenders making these small , or microcredit , loans are dutifully throwing cash at shantytown borrowers . And the funds  --  $1.3 billion was lent during the year ended Mar. 31 , up from $4 million in 1996  --  are often being used not as seed money for a new enterprise , such as buying a cow to sell the milk or setting up a fruit stand , but as handouts spent on consumption . D.S.K. Rao , the Asia organizer for the Microcredit Summit Campaign , estimates that only one-fifth of Indian microcredit borrowers start a business . Mathew Titus , executive director of New Delhi-headquartered Sa-Dhan , an association of microcredit lenders , says it 's one-third , counting women who barter instead of selling goods . <p> Alas , there has never been a rigorous study in India or elsewhere of how successful the businesses become , whether any of the borrowers eventually graduate to the middle class or how many of the loans get repaid on time . " I do n't know of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says New York University professor Jonathan Morduch , who focuses on microcredit and economic development . <p> For much of its 35-year history microcredit has enjoyed glowing reviews , culminating last month when Muhammad Yunus  --  founder of Bangladesh 's microlending Grameen Bank  --  won the Nobel Peace Prize . The tiny loans appeal to both idealistic aid workers and gimlet-eyed bankers . They seem to help the poor in developing countries earn a livelihood without making them dependent on handouts . And they use market mechanisms , allowing banks to charge interest rates high enough to cover the risks of lending to people with no collateral and little credit history . In India rates average 30% a year , though some lenders charge more than 45% . <p> In the last decade microcredit has taken off . The 1997 Microcredit Summit in Washington , D.C.  --  sponsors included the World Bank , MasterCard and JPMorgan  --  vaulted microlending onto the world stage . Participants pledged to lend to 100 million families worldwide within a decade . Pushing to maintain the momentum , the United Nations named 2005 the International Year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Development to Citigroup trumpet the idea . <p> Much of that attention is focused on India , which is home to a quarter of the world 's poor but also one of the hottest economies . The country has seen an explosion of microfinance institutions , which are usually set up by nongovernmental organizations . Ten years ago 400 institutions boasted 200,000 customers . Today there are 1,000 that , together with 300 commercial banks , lend to 17.5 million people , according to Sanjay Sinha , managing director of Micro-Credit Ratings International in India . Much of the lending is based on Yunus ' original idea  --  making loans to groups of women and relying on peer pressure from the members to ensure repayment . " India was very small in this field ten years ago , " says Sam R. Daley-Harris , director of the Microcredit Summit Campaign . " Now they 're going like gangbusters , expanding ferociously . " <p> The money to fund all these lenders comes mostly from India 's biggest commercial banks , such as ICICI , State Bank of India and Canara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and banks making social-responsibility bets , and by overseas donors . Technology entrepreneurs are particularly intrigued . The foundations of Bill and Melinda Gates and Michael and Susan Dell have each given $4 million or more to microcredit organizations . Vinod Khosla , a Sun Microsystems founder and venture capital star , has put at least $1 million into Indian microfinance institutions , as donations and investments . <p> " In their anxiety to expand very fast , they are pushing loans , " says Rao , the microcredit campaign organizer . " They 're not careful in vetting . " At least , some groups of borrowers are first required to save money that they can put down as collateral ; others must outline their business ideas to lenders . <p> The rapid growth also means that lenders are less likely to keep tabs on a borrower after a loan is made . In India , says Daley-Harris , borrowers sometimes " are on their own after a couple of years , whereas in Bangladesh there 's a bank worker who often visits every week for a lifetime . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in Afghanistan one for 54 , but in India the ratio is one to 439 , according to the Microfinance Information Exchange in Washington . The women in India could probably use more guidance , because it 's so difficult to run a business there : The country ranks 134th out of 175 that the World Bank studied this year for ease of doing business . <p> The result is that lenders often hand over money without taking the time to educate the borrowers , making sure they understand that they 're supposed to start businesses and that there are penalties for not paying the money back , says Gowramma , secretary of the Bangalore branch of the All India Democratic Women 's Association , who works with women in the slums . " The people receiving these loans do not know what this microcredit system is all about , " she says . <p> This means that microcredit 's other goal  --  to empower women in highly patriarchal societies  --  is n't always achieved , either . In Tumkur , a city outside Bangalore , a group of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed their hands on the money and pledged to use their loans to launch businesses . But afterward , each handed the money to her husband , and the men started the businesses . Because the women are responsible for repaying the loan , they suffer the consequences if their husbands squander the money . <p> Microcredit advocates often claim impressively high repayment rates , averaging 95% , as proof that borrowers do use their loans to generate income . Otherwise they would n't be able to pay them back , they argue . " Can microcredit be done badly ? Absolutely , " Daley-Harris says . " Can it make a massive difference in people 's lives when it 's done well ? Absolutely . " <p> But in some cases women borrow from other sources to repay the loans . That often means resorting to moneylenders  --  or loans from friends and family  --  to pay back the microloan and vice versa , trapping them in a cycle of debt . The lucky ones have family members who have migrated to cities or abroad to work and send back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microcredit borrowers also borrow informally , says Thomas Dichter , who has evaluated microcredit programs in 20 countries , including India . " You 're getting a large number of people borrowing from Peter to pay Paul , " says Dichter , who wrote the 2003 book Despite Good Intentions : Why Development Assistance to the Third World Has Failed . <p> More important , Dichter and others who study microfinance doubt the repayment rates . There are no reliable figures on the percentage of loans delinquent for more than , say , six months . But it 's telling that the vast majority of the microlenders are not " sustainable , " meaning that so few loans are repaid on time and costs are so high that lenders need to keep tapping the easily available funds from banks , donors and the government to stay in business . <p> More than anything , the microcredit bubble is being inflated by government rules that all but force lenders to keep pumping out microloans . New Delhi requires banks to devote 40% of the money they lend to a category of borrowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to rural outfits . Banks have long struggled to meet this obligation , and lending to microcredit institutions that then lend to the groups of women offers an easy way to do it . <p> Sometimes microcredit does live up to its billing . Manjula , a 40-year-old seamstress who lives in Bagalur , a village 90 minutes away from downtown Bangalore , struggled to support her two children without help from her alcoholic husband . She depended on moneylenders , who charge up to 1,000% a year . Two $220 microcredit loans over two years enabled her to open a shop selling saris , which she had been peddling from her home . Since then she has increased her monthly income from $45 to $110 , including the earnings from side jobs tailoring and teaching sewing classes . That 's enough to pay off her loan and save $30 a month . " My dream is to convert this place into a big shop , " she says proudly . <p> It was success stories like this that drew Khosla , an affiliated partner in Silicon Valley venture capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microcredit in his native India . Three microfinance lenders that he funds  --  SKS Microfinance , Share Microfin and Activists for Social Alternatives  --  are on a top-ten list compiled by Micro-Credit Ratings International , and he becomes so passionate about microcredit that his eyes tear up when he talks about it . " This is the single most important tool for addressing poverty I have ever seen . " <p> Might a careful study turn that article of faith into a provable proposition ? " I do n't need that study , " Khosla says . " I wo n't spend a penny on it because I 've talked to 200 women who are recipients of these microloans myself . I 've seen it in the field . " <p> Even Manjula 's success story needs some cautionary footnotes . She started out with distinct advantages . Unlike most of India 's poor , she is educated , speaks some English and started her business before receiving the loan . And Manjula has n't been able to completely stop borrowing from moneylenders . <p> " The research is skimpy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main hope for microcredit  --  that it will generate millions of tiny businesses and these businesses will grow and pull their owners over the poverty line  --  is false , " says Dichter , the author . By the Numbers <p> Microcredit is quickly spreading in India , but the loans do n't always lead to businesses ; in some cases they are even used to pay off previous debts . 200,000 People getting loans in 1996. 17.5 million People getting loans in 2006 . <p> $4 million Value of loans granted in 1996 . <p> $1.3 billion Value of loans granted in 2006 . <p> $75 Size of average loan . <p> Figures for year ending Mar. 31 . <p> Source : Micro-Credit Ratings International . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Solemn vow : Borrowers in Tumkur pledge to repay their loans . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Manjula in Bagalur used a loan to expand her sari business . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : A man in Tumkur cosigns for a loan . <p> By Claire Cain Miller <p>        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
