<p> Money talks . <p> And in the takeover battle for Wachovia , money is likely to have the last say on whether Wachovia will fall into the clutches of First Union  --  its preferred suitor  --  or SunTrust Banks . <p> SunTrust on Monday made an unsolicited $14.7 billion bid for Wachovia , topping a $12.5 billion offer by First Union , as both banks seek to expand in the Southeast . <p> Hostile takeovers of banks have been rare in recent years . And the battle is fraught with risk . Some analysts predict that if SunTrust were to fail in its bid , it might itself be snapped up by a larger financial institution . <p> And some of metro Atlanta 's corporate titans who sit on the boards of SunTrust and Wachovia find themselves on opposite sides of the table . <p> Opinion is divided as to who will ultimately win the prize . But if the battle is protracted , analysts say the losers may well be customers and employees . <p> " It could hurt morale , " said analyst Thomas Theurkauf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specializing in financial services stocks . " Employees do n't know what 's going to happen next . Customer service could deteriorate . " <p> SunTrust Banks ' chairman and chief executive , L. Phillip Humann , conceded that point . <p> " I think that 's a legitimate concern , particularly with respect to Wachovia 's employees , " Humann said . " I hope it 's a factor that Wachovia 's board considers . " He urged Wachovia 's board of directors to terminate its merger agreement with First Union and to expedite talks with SunTrust . <p> That 's unlikely , for now . <p> " We have a binding legal agreement with Wachovia that we intend to vigorously pursue to consummation , " G. Kennedy Thomson , First Union 's chairman , president and chief executive , said in a statement late Monday . <p> " We plan to continue the constructive merger integration dialogue which we 've had over the past month and look forward to completing our merger with Wachovia . " <p> For its part , Wachovia said its board of directors " will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . " It said its merger with First Union " is proceeding on schedule " and " SunTrust 's proposal requires no immediate action by Wachovia 's shareholders . " <p> Cash could decide prize <p> SunTrust 's latest offer marks the second time it has attempted to combine with Wachovia since late last year . Wachovia pulled out of a deal in December at the last minute . <p> David Stumpf of A.G. Edwards &; Sons thinks Wachovia 's board eventually will consider SunTrust 's latest offer , which calls for swapping 1.081 of its shares for each Wachovia share . It offered 1.03 shares in December . First Union has offered two of its shares for each Wachovia share . <p> To sweeten the deal , SunTrust said it would increase its annual dividend to $2.22 a share to give Wachovia shareholders the equivalent of the $2.40 a share dividend they get now . SunTrust 's annual dividend is currently $1.60 . <p> " The SunTrust offer is a financially higher offer , " Stumpf said . " I believe Wachovia 's board will be compelled to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysts predicted the fight could be a lengthy one . <p> Richard X. Bove of Raymond James &; Associates thinks the battle will last three months . And he predicts First Union will prevail . <p> " First Union is n't going to get the sweetheart deal that it had before , " Bove said . " But I think First Union is going to win the contest . It ca n't afford to let a trophy like Wachovia get away . Bottom line , First Union comes back ( with a higher offer ) , then SunTrust comes back , then First Union . " <p> Bove noted that First Union is much larger than SunTrust in terms of assets and has more cash . <p> And cash , he predicted , could decide who will walk away with the prize . First Union and SunTrust are unlikely to significantly increase the stock portion of their deals , he said . <p> " It would only kill the price of their own stock , " Bove explained . So he thinks any higher bids will include cash . <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose $3.85 to $64.75 . First Union tacked on 56 cents to $30.58 . <p> Bove calculates First Union has $50 billion to $78 billion in cash vs. $18 billion to $25 billion for SunTrust . <p> " I think Wachovia 's going to go for $75  --  $60 in stock and $15 in cash , " Bove predicted . That would value Wachovia at about $15.78 billion , based on more than 210.3 million shares outstanding . " The company that makes that offer will be the winner , and I think First Union will be the winner . " <p> Bove said that at $75 , Wachovia would sell at about 15 times this year 's estimated earnings . <p> Not everyone shares Bove 's view . Mark Patterson , an analyst at NWQ Investment Management , which owns about 2.5 million First Union shares , went on record as discounting a bidding war . <p> Even if the bidding does not continue , SunTrust has increased its own profile . According to at least one analyst , that increases the risk of SunTrust itself becoming a takeover target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , " Bove said . " SunTrust revealed how strong their earnings position is . " <p> CEO Humann does n't think SunTrust will be a target . <p> " We looked very hard at the vulnerability issue , " he said . " We decided it 's not an issue . We do not have to do this acquisition . We do n't believe there is any vulnerability . " <p> First Union also could be a target if it fails to win Wachovia , said Stumpf of A.G. Edwards . <p> " If SunTrust is successful with its bid for Wachovia , we could see more deal-making among larger regional banks given the increased threat of unsolicited interest on the part of buyers , " he said . " And , interestingly , First Union could emerge as one of the more vulnerable targets . " <p> So the stakes are high . <p> " We do n't know where this is going to take us , " said analyst Theurkauf of Keefe , Bruyette &; Woods . " This is a book that may contain many chapters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain is that a merger of SunTrust and Wachovia would create a Southeastern powerhouse . <p> It would have a " dominant franchise from Baltimore though Florida , " said Stumpf . <p> The combined companies would have about $180 billion in assets , $98 billion in deposits , 1,842 branches , 3,347 ATMs and more than 7.5 million retail customers . <p> The unit would become the nation 's eighth-largest banking firm with the most deposits in Georgia , Florida , South Carolina and Virginia . It would be No. 3 in North Carolina , No. 4 in Tennessee and No. 5 in Maryland . <p> In metro Atlanta , the combined companies would have deposits of $16.8 billion , with a No. 1 market share of 31 percent . <p> In the Washington , D.C. , area , it also would be tops , with deposits of $11.6 billion , for a 19 percent share . A bank with a deposit relationship with a customer can sell that customer more products and services , such as loans and financial investments . <p> Other big markets include Orlando , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> SunTrust said regulators might require it to sell up to $1.5 billion in deposits . <p> " It 's where we overlap the most , " said Humann . " We 're basically talking about Georgia and Virginia . But that , interestingly , does n't include metro Atlanta . It 's the smaller and medium-sized markets . " <p> Humann did n't identify the markets . <p> Many jobs on the line <p> Georgia is one of the nation 's most attractive banking markets . One reason : The state 's population grew 26.4 percent over the last decade , more than twice the national average of 13.1 percent , according to the Census Bureau . Florida 's population grew 23.5 percent during the comparable period . <p> SunTrust proposes to wring out $500 million in costs within three years after the merger . <p> Specifically , it said it would cut about 4,000 jobs , or 8 percent of the combined work force , and close 150 to 175 branches . <p> In contrast , First Union has said it expects to reduce costs by $890 million , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 300 branches . <p> SunTrust said the acquisition would add slightly to earnings per share in the first year , excluding merger-related costs .
