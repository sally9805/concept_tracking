Section : Hands On health care AN OPERATING MANUAL FOR BUSINESS There is a competitive market for individual insurance policies . But you may want to think twice before sending your employees off on their own <p> FOR MORE THAN six years , the PGA Tour searched for a way out of a vexing sand trap : how to provide health insurance to the tour 's 200 caddies . Like players , caddies are independent contractors . Sure , the PGA Tour could cover them under the group insurance policy it offers its 3,000 full-time employees , but since caddies work some years and not others , that would be an administrative nightmare . And then there was the cost : an estimated $1.4 million a year . <p> Healthy Option : The PGA gave caddy John Buchna a $1,000 subsidy . <p> But not covering the caddies no longer seemed like a good option either . " As an organization , we want to support the caddies ' well-being , " says Andrea King , the tour 's vice president of treasury and administration . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a public relations problem for the PGA , when golf legend Tom Watson 's longtime caddy , Bruce Edwards , died of Lou Gehrig 's disease in 2004 . Because Edwards had no health insurance , Watson paid tens of thousands of dollars out of his own pocket for his caddy 's treatment . Heartwarming . But a player 's generosity is n't exactly an insurance policy . <p> So King was intrigued when a benefits consultant suggested a new strategy last year : Give the caddies a predetermined amount of cash and let them buy their own individual policies from insurance companies . The caddies would have coverage , whether or not they were working , and the tour would avoid administrative annoyances and keep a lid on costs . " The light bulbs started popping , King says . " We started to realize that this could really work . " <p> Individual health insurance ? Are n't such policies hopelessly complicated and prohibitively expensive ? Not necessarily . As the number of people without employer-sponsored insurance grows , and as so-called consumer-directed health care plans like health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HSAs ) become more popular , insurance companies are rolling out new policies geared to people buying on their own  --  with little to no employer involvement . And benefits consultants are increasingly encouraging business owners to consider them . <p> Contrary to their reputation , individual insurance policies are often less expensive than group policies . In 2004 , annual premiums for plans purchased individually averaged $2,268 for a single person and $4,424 for a family , according to America 's Health Insurance Plans , an industry trade group in Washington , D.C. That 's about half as much as the average annual premium for employer-sponsored coverage of individuals ( $4,024 ) and families ( $10,880 ) . " Individuals can purchase a wide range of affordable coverage " says AHIP CEO Karen Ignagni , who expects insurers to offer more individual policies in the years to come as the trend toward consumer-directed health care gathers momentum . <p> Here 's how it works : Companies create accounts for employees and each year fund the accounts with enough cash for employees to pay for all or a portion of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2005 , caddies get an annual subsidy of $1,000 each , which should cover about half of the average single person 's individual policy or about a quarter of the average family policy . The cost to the tour : $200,000 , about one-seventh of the cost of the group plan . Paul Zane Pilzer , an economist and author of The New Health Insurance Solution , argues that with savings like that , employers should move toward canceling their group policies and encourage all of their employees to purchase their insurance individually . <p> But before you rush to cancel your group policy , there are some important factors to consider . For one , individual insurance is cheaper than group policies because , in 46 states , insurers may " medically underwrite " individual applicants  --  that is , examine the health of each applicant and adjust the premium accordingly . ( In the four states that forbid underwriting  --  New York , New Jersey , Washington , and Maine  --  individual policies tend to be extremely expensive , even for healthy applicants . ) Those who make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all applicants , according to AHIP  --  tend to be young and healthy , and therefore worthy of a cheaper premium . They 're also more likely to be willing to take bare-bones policies  --  hence the relatively low average premiums . <p> An applicant with a chronic condition or one who is at risk for developing one , on the other hand , may face what 's known as an uprating  --  a boost in the premium of 15% to 50% . Or the applicant may face an exclusion , in which the insurer provides coverage for everything except for what 's likely to be an expensive health problem . ( In other words , a diabetic may be able to obtain only a policy that does n't cover expenses relating to the diabetes . ) An insurer can also reject an application and deny coverage altogether . At this point , 88% of insurance applicants are approved , about three-quarters of them without uprating or exclusions , according to AHIP . It sounds promising , but bear in mind that most brokers discourage likely rejects from even bothering to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you have employees who are older or in less than perfect health , those employees may have a problem obtaining meaningful individual insurance . What will you do with employees who wo n't qualify for individual insurance ? And how will you handle the bellyaching of those who are uprated ? <p> Indeed , even healthy employees may face difficulties in the individual market down the road . Insurers are forbidden by federal law from " re-underwriting " people once they 've been accepted into a policy . But they are allowed to reexamine them if they switch plans . A low-frills policy that looked like a bargain when you were young and healthy may be less appealing as you grow older . And no matter what , insurers are permitted to increase premiums with age  --  so business owners who hold the subsidy steady are in effect providing less of a benefit with each passing year . <p> And there 's one more problem with nudging employees out into the individual market : They might not be ready for it . Two-thirds of employees with health insurance prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer them a cash account option , according to a September 2005 survey from the Commonwealth Fund , a New York City-based think tank . " To the extent that your competitors continue to offer group health benefits , you may have difficulty attracting and retaining high-caliber employees , " says Joe Martingale , national leader for health care strategy at the benefits consulting firm Watson Wyatt . Of course , people who do n't have any insurance at all might feel differently about the matter . <p> At the PGA Tour , about 45 caddies out of 200 have signed up for the new plan . John Buchna , 50 , who 's caddied for Joey Sindelar for 22 years , was among the first to sign up . His new policy is not exactly a bargain  --  the premium runs $5,000 a year  --  but the Tour 's $1,000 subsidy made it affordable for him . " It 's a very kind gesture " says Buchna . " But I 'm just anxious to see what they 'll do next year . " <p> Business owners worried about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the individual market shakes out over the next few years . Martingale , for his part , remains skeptical , and says he wo n't recommend such policies to his clients until premiums are affordable and stable for both the sick and the healthy . " Employers look forward to the day when they can get out from under the terrible burden that providing health benefits represents , " he says . " But that day is not now .
