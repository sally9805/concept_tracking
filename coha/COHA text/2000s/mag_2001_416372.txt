On the set of Kate &; Leopold in May , the newly single Ryan " was happy , not even a little bit depressed or lonely , " says costume designer Donna Zakowska . " She 's moving forward . " // At the end of a tumultuous year that saw an end to both her marriage and a heated affair , Meg Ryan celebrates a new freedom Talk about right time , right place : Bob Mitchell was in for one very happy surprise when he hobbled up to Onieal 's bar and restaurant on April 19 . A regular at the hip Manhattan hangout , the 41-year-old Off-Broadway producer  --  on crutches because of a broken leg-had just stepped inside when , from out of the din , a beautiful blonde in a skin-tight shirt ran up and wrapped him in a warm embrace . Seconds later , realizing that Mitchell was not , in fact , the old friend she 'd mistaken him for , she apologized and quickly backed off . In a fit of giggles she returned to her gang of girlfriends ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margaritas ( poured straight up in a martini glass ) and a night of dancing . Mitchell , meanwhile , made his way to the bar , sat down on a stool and coolly informed the bartender , " Meg Ryan just gave me a big kiss . " Mitchell may be telling that story for years . But for Ryan , 39 , the kiss was likely less memorable-unlike the ones she was doling out this time last year , when the British press reported that the girl-next-door star of When Harry Met Sally . . . , Sleepless in Seattle and You 've Got Mail was cheating on her husband of nine years , Dennis Quaid , 47 , with her Proof of Life costar Russell Crowe , 37 . Within weeks of announcing their separation on June 28 , 2000 , she and Quaid  --  whom Ryan had helped see through cocaine and alcohol trouble-filed for divorce . And amid the media frenzy that followed , Ryan 's world turned upside down . She moved out of the $2.9 million Brentwood , Calif. , home she had shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $8.9 million Bel Air home a few miles away . She closed her production company . She saw Proof of Life bomb at the box office . And she stood by bewildered while the world stood in judgment of her . Within months she had gone from America 's Sweetheart to Scarlet Woman and finally-after reports that Crowe had dumped her-to Woman Scorned . Little wonder Ryan found the attention bizarre . " I have n't thought of myself as a famous person , " she told W magazine last November , " until this recent episode in my life . " Photograph Ryan and Quaid ( in LA. in 1998 ) " make natural friends , " says a pal of Ryan 's . " Maybe that 's a better format for them . " // But as one close friend notes , Ryan was more than famous-she was a national icon of wholesomeness . " Meg was expected to adhere to this standard that others are n't , " the pal says . " Her marriage was n't supposed to fail . So when it did , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insists the friend , Ryan had n't left Quaid for Crowe . That scenario , she maintains , " just has nothing to do with reality . Their marriage had had lots of problems for a long time . A big part of that was that they did n't see each other for long periods of time because of work . " Naturally , Ryan was hardly delighted to find herself cast as the villain-one of them , anyway-in an out-of-control media soap opera . " I definitely have moments of wanting to straighten it all out and tell everyone what really went down , " she told Harper 's Bazaar last January . " But , you know , who would I be proving anything to ? " In fact , by last week , when Ryan and Jack were traipsing through Thailand-where the only available males she encountered were the elephants in a TV documentary she was making-proving her sense of balance on a mischievous 4-ton beast seemed her only concern . Sitting bareback on the neck of a 28-year-old female named Sao Yai , Ryan was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chailert , when the elephant dipped down into a deep river sending water rushing around Ryan 's knees . " But then she just laughed , " she adds . " Sao Yai is very humorous . She was joking with Meg . " And earlier this year , in Los Angeles and in Manhattan , where Ryan stayed in her three-bedroom Fifth Avenue apartment while shooting the romantic comedy Kate &; Leopold this spring , the actress seemed bent on proving nothing at all . Says a neighbor in her building : " We see her all the time , in the lobby getting her mail , waiting for the elevator . She 's very friendly and approachable . She goes shopping at the supermarket and carries her bags home by herself . She stands in line for coffee . She stands in line for take-out food . The doormen all adore her . She 's adorable . " Photograph " Russell was trying to give her whatever she wanted , " a friend says of Ryan ( with Crowe in Santa Monica in ' ' 00 ) .

" Photograph Ryan ( in Thailand in June ) was " very easy " and inquisitive , says guide Lek Chailert ; she had " no complaints " about sleeping in a hut without toilets . // And content , apparently , being Single in the City . " She is coming from a very strong , positive place , " says costume designer Donna Zakowska , who befriended Ryan while working on Leopold . " For some people , seeing her transition into being single could be a negative thing . But she is not looking at it that way . Now is the moment for her to define herself as a solo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By most accounts , Ryan 's quest for self-definition began long before last summer 's controversy . As early as 1998 , Ryan had spoken openly of " the danger " posed by the film careers that caused her and Quaid to lead largely separate lives . " That can be really disastrous , " she said , " going off and having fun everywhere else but not together . " By the time she arrived in Ecuador to film Proof last spring , the two were in serious trouble . And Crowe proved just the tonic for her malaise : a bad-boy ladies ' man known for his bar brawls but also a gentle romantic who writes songs and poetry and spent hours just talking to Ryan-and listening . As Ryan later said : " To be heard-and really seen-is the ultimate turn-on . " Sufficiently ignited , Ryan did little to hide her feelings for Crowe once she and Quaid formally announced their split . " They seemed crazy about each other , " says her friend . " They had great talks , they e-mailed each other a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In early September the two were holding hands and kissing as they shopped in Santa Monica . A week later they were in Australia , taking in a rodeo in Nana Glen , a bushland hamlet where Crowe owns a 560-acre farm , and touring the country in his black BMW . The pair even conducted a make-believe house hunt through Sydney . " It was sweet , " says Ryan 's friend . " He 'd point and say , How about that one ? " ' For her part Ryan was " extremely infatuated " with Crowe , says a pal-and with reason . " He 's a tough thing to resist , " says her friend Carrie Fisher , adding with a laugh , " I was just glad I had a friend that got him . If I ca n't have him , I want to hear what he 's like-at some point , when she 's willing to talk . " When , on Dec. 7 , Ryan and Crowe strolled hand in hand through the tony furniture shops in L.A. 's Pacific Design Center , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them buying a pricey Oriental rug at J.H. Minassian &; Co . " Definitely a couple . " They could not have been pleased , of course , when in subsequent days Proof of Life proved less than lively at the box office-and director Taylor Hackford declared their high-profile romance " disastrous " for the movie 's performance . The comment incensed Crowe , who later grumbled at the film 's London premiere , " He 's a f  --  idiot . " But bad box office was n't Crowe 's only problem . By late December colleagues and friends noticed a cooling of his and Ryan 's public ardor . " I think it was your typical costar fling , destined to run its course and bum out , " says one Proof crew member . But in fact , says Ryan 's friend , Crowe 's affection was only burning brighter : " Russell wanted to marry Meg and have kids with her . " For her part , she adds , Ryan felt that Crowe 's attention and giftsincluding a puppy and a vintage 1963 Buick Riviera-were " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still negotiating peace with Quaid and determined to protect Jack as much as possible , she reportedly began to back off . " She 's not dumb , " says her friend . " She was not looking to get into another relationship right away . " Reports of Ryan 's tearful refusal to go quietly , the pal says , " got it backwards . " On Dec. 21 Ryan , looking fatigued , checked solo into the St. Regis Hotel in Aspen , where she stayed a few days getting massages and wandering alone through shops " aimlessly , " says an observer , " like she was passing time . " Then she headed home to L.A. for a quiet Christmas with Jack , who spent half the day with her , half with Quaid . Photograph Crowe ( filming A Beautiful Mind in March ) " is very serious , a perfectionist , " says a colleague . At first , the songs Quaid ( in Austin in April ) wrote after the breakup " were maudlin , " he says . Now they 're " joyful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Australia , where he threw rocking Christmas and New Year 's bashes and partied with various lady friends . But despite appearances , says Ryan 's friend , he still hoped to salvage the romance : " The guy is probably used to getting everything he wants . I do n't know that he could figure out what else he could do to make it work . " When Ryan turned down his request to accompany him to the Golden Globes on Jan. 21 , the surly star-by now taking precautions against kidnapping threats-showed up late , left early and , as gossip columnist Liz Smith reported , ended the evening at the Hotel Bel-Air with Courtney Love . More disturbing to Ryan was his failure to publicly deny the Russell  --  dumped-Meg reports . " Nobody corrected the misperception , " the friend says . " He never came to her aid . It still works to humiliate her . " Perhaps it should n't . His gruff exterior aside , Crowe 's regard for Ryan seems undeniable . " Meg is a beautiful and courageous lady , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he attributed their breakup to her need to be in the U.S. and his to " wake up in the sun and walk around under the trees " on his farm in Australia , he sounded regretful . The romance gave him " a lot of light , mate , " he said , adding , " I 'm an expert at unrequited love . " Ryan , meanwhile , seems to have become an expert at healing . Since her breakup with Crowe , she and Quaid have settled into a friendly relationship . For Jack 's birthday in April , the two were together in Montana , where Quaid has kept the 100-acre ranch he owned before marrying . And in May , Ryan had her arms around both her son and her ex on a Sunday stroll in Beverly Hills . " Dennis is a good guy , " says Ryan 's friend . " Meg talks sweetly about him . He is a good dad , and both he and Meg are absolutely hands-on parents . " To protect Jack , says a source close to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend the night at their homes or become too involved in Jack 's life for another year . Not that there seems to be anyone on the horizon . Last winter Quaid was seen with ( and kissing ) Andie MacDowell , 43 , his costar in the forthcoming drama Dinner with Friends , but MacDowell 's rep denies any romance between the Montana neighbors . Like Crowe , Quaid has his own band-the Sharks ( named by Jack ) - who appeared regularly in Quaid 's home state of Texas while he filmed The Rookie in Austin this spring . ( Among their numbers : a cover of the Rolling Stones ' chestnut " It 's All Over Now . " ) He has also been spotted in clubs from Milan to Manhattan ( where he did a bar-top boogie at the hot downtown bar Hogs &; Heifers in January ) , happily hanging with any number of beautiful women . So , for that matter , has Ryan . She attended a black-tie benefit for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at Manhattan 's WaldorfAstoria in March with Melissa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's champagne-and-caviar birthday party at Santa Monica 's Buffalo Club in May and sang backup on " Heal Me " on Etheridge 's new album Skin . The relationship , however , has not gone beyond strictly platonic . Says her friend with a laugh : " Believe me , there 's nothing intriguing there . " Though more complicated than she appeared to be a year ago , Ryan is still Ryan-not the cute blonde innocent she has played so often onscreen but still the $20 million-per-picture superstar who , as producer Sam Goldwyn Jr . puts it , " I would get down on my knees " to work with . Over the next few months , she could choose to date or , as one friend says , " take a break and reflect . " She could get funky and move to Manhattan 's Greenwich Village ( she recently put her $7.2 million Central Park co-op on the market and is looking at lofts downtown ) . But one thing is certain : She wo n't disappear . " If people in the Bible Belt think what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike Fenton , " it may be hard to get really big box office numbers for a while . But it will soon be forgotten . " Agrees producer Robert Cort ( Runaway Bride ) , who is talking to Ryan about playing female boxing manager Jackie Kallen : " Meg Ryan is rock solid .
