1 What 's the best way to cope with a toddler who wakes several times night ? When young children are waking during the night , two things usually need to be addressed : the way they are falling asleep and the way you respond to their wakings . Night wakers typically associate certain conditions with falling asleep . We sometimes call these negative associations because a child can not do them on his own - such as nursing , drinking a bottle , being rocked or lying down with a parent . Meanwhile , positive associations are available to the child throughout the night - such as white noise , a Hankie or a pacifier ( so long as the child is able to put it in his mouth by himself ) . Partial wakings at night are normal for children ( for adults too ) - they usually happen three to eight times a night . But for a child who does n't fall asleep on his own , these arousals often turn into full awakenings , and he may need to repeat his bedtime routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without negative associations will help resolve this problem . Some toddlers fall asleep independently , but get up because their parents reinforce the wakings by feeding or bringing them to their bed . Changing your response and sticking with it can help . For example , if you stay calm and do n't offer a bottle or back rub , your toddler will probably find night waking less appealing . 2 How much sleep do kids actually need ? The following table provided by the US National Sleep Foundation gives recommended hours of sleep for young children . Of course , some will need less or more - your child 's mood and behaviour is the best gauge of this . If you have concerns she is sleeping too little or too much , speak with her physician . Why do doctors say that children older than six months do n't need to be fed during the night ? What if they really seem hungry ? Many paediatricians agree that healthy , full-term infants do not need to be fed during the night after six months of age . This guideline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating solid foods . Parents often report that their child seems hungry when he wakes at night . He probably is hungry - but out of habit because he 's used to getting a portion of his daily calorie intake at night . I recommend weaning off the nighttime feeds gradually over a few days or weeks . Children often start eating more during the day to make up for not eating at night . In some cases , children will need to continue nighttime feeds after six months of age ( for example , if they 're not gaining weight as expected or are not yet eating solid foods regularly ) . 4 Should I be worried about a child who sleepwalks ? Parents often worry that sleepwalking is caused by an underlying psychological problem , or that it results in psychological harm . But the consensus , based on the research , is that neither worry is founded . Experts estimate that up to 40 percent of children sleepwalk at some point . It usually happens early in the night - one to three hours after a child falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 , but often begins between four and six . Most kids outgrow it by adolescence . We do not fully understand why people sleepwalk . But we usually come by it honestly - 80 to 90 percent of children who sleepwalk have a family member who does too . Not getting enough sleep is a common cause , and stress , a full bladder , illness or even noise can also trigger sleepwalking . Sleepwalkers may be clumsy and do strange things , such as urinating in a closet - yet have no memory of it the next day ( unless woken when it 's happening ) . If your child is sleepwalking , gently guide her back to bed . Disturbing her can make her agitated and prolong the episode . To keep your sleepwalker safe , clear the floor and use safety locks on windows and doors . Hanging a bell over her door will alert you if she leaves her room . 5 How do I know when my child is ready to stop napping ? Most children are down to a single nap , usually after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kids typically drop the final nap between ages three and five . There are two main signs that a child may be ready for this . First , it will take him longer to fall asleep , or he will stop falling asleep altogether , at nap time . You might try a later nap because as kids get older , they need to be awake longer to increase their drive to sleep . Most preschoolers need to be awake for seven or eight hours before a nap . A later bedtime ( after 8:30 p.m. ) may also be a sign that your child no longer needs a nap . Try limiting nap time to one hour ; if he still has difficulty falling asleep at night , you can probably drop the nap . When you do this , your child will likely need an earlier bedtime . 6 Is there anything parents can do to help prevent early wakings ? Early waking ( before 6 or 6:30 a.m. , depending on the child 's bedtime ) is a common parental complaint , and can be tricky to resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consider installing room-darkening shades and a white-noise machine to block sunlight and noise . If heavy diapers are waking your child , give her less to drink in the last few hours before bed ( and offer her more earlier in the day ) . Sometimes putting a child to bed late - possibly in the hope of getting her to sleep longer - can have the opposite effect . A good bedtime for most young children is between 7:30 and 8 p.m. ox , if she is still napping , closer to 8:30 p.m . Giving your child a " morning signal " for when it 's time to get up can be helpful . I often recommend attaching a night light to a timer . Children as young as two can learn that they can get up when the light is on , and that they must return to sleep when it 's off . 7 When I put my four-month-old to bed , he starts to cry and rolls over onto his tummy . Do I need to keep rolling him over to make sure he sleeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that until a child can roll onto his tummy , he should sleep on his back , as this position is associated with a decreased risk of sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS ) . Once a child can roll onto his tummy on his own , he is probably safe sleeping in this position . Unless there is a medical reason for him not to sleep this way , it is not necessary to keep repositioning him . 8 I 've read about transitional objects , but am not sure what they are . Should all parents give them to their kids ? Is a pacifier a good transitional object ? Transitional objects are things children use to comfort and soothe themselves at bedtime and during naps . I am a big advocate of them . A pacifier is a great transitional object if your child can use it on her own , including in the dark . Blankies are a good option for many children . Just be sure that if your child is still in a crib , the blankie is small enough that it can not wrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of breathable material . Check with your child 's physician if you have concerns . 9 If I do n't sleep-train my child , am I doing her a disservice ? Good sleep - both in quality and amount - is as important as good nutrition . Sleep deprivation has been shown to affect both physical and psychological functioning . The goal of sleep training is to help your child develop the skill of falling asleep independently . It typically involves checking on your child briefly and at gradually increasing intervals , offering her words of reassurance , but not picking her up or soothing her for longer than a minute . Some lucky parents have kids who fall and stay asleep without major fussing - they never need to sleep-train . And although parents whose kids do have problems are often told their children will outgrow them , this is usually not the case . Research has shown that sleep problems are among the most chronic behavioural problems in children , persisting even into adulthood . While sleep training can be controversial , most experts agree on its benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with children 's behaviour , learning and physical development . Parents have reported that children have a greater sense of security after sleep training . There 's evidence that it eases anxiety and depression for moms , and gives marriages a boost . And there is no evidence that sleep training results in psychological harm . Sleep training is often easier and quicker the younger the child is , but you should wait until your baby is at least four months old , and be sure she is healthy , before trying it . It 's also a good idea to rule out any medical causes for sleep problems before you start sleep training . It 's worth noting that sleep training may not be something all parents are comfortable doing . You need to decide what works best for your family . 10 My two-year-old was never a good sleeper and I received a lot of advice to do " whatever works . " I have been co-sleeping with him , but he is still waking . I would like him to sleep in his own room and wonder how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is key when it comes to changing where a toddler or preschooler sleeps . You might start by sleeping with him in his room , ideally on a mattress on the floor . Introducing a transitional object ( see question 8 ) can also be helpful . Once he 's more comfortable sleeping in his own room , you can move out step by step . Start by sitting near his bed , then move farther away over the course of a few weeks . If he wakes during the night , try doing what you do at bedtime ( for example , sitting by the door ) to help him fall back to sleep . The final step is having him fall asleep independently ( brief checks are OK ) . During this process , your child will probably get out of bed several times . Silently lead him back . You might try using a reward chart to reinforce positive behaviour , or involve him in setting up his new big-boy room - he can help pick out new sheets and pyjamas , for example .
