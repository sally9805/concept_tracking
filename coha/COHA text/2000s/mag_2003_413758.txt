Dak. , close to where Interstate 90 crosses the Missouri River today . Mentions of mule deer are few and far between in the explorers ' journals , primarily because the river corridor was n't prime mule deer habitat . The cover along the river was composed primarily of cottonwood , willows and other riparian species  --  far better suited to whitetails than mule deer . According to the accounts of Meriwether Lewis , members of the Corps of Discovery seldom saw mule deer " in any except a rough country ; they prefer the open grounds and are seldom found in the woodlands near the river ; when they are met with in the woodland or river bottoms and are pursued , they invariably run into the hills or open country as the Elk do . The contrary happens with the common white-tailed deer . " The explorers described mule deer as " Black tail deer , " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lewis and Clark 's descriptive name for mule deer was derived from the animals ' black-tipped , ropelike tails . On October 5 , 1804 , Clark reported : " one of the men killed a Shee Brarow a female badger , another killed a Black tail Deer , the largest doe I ever saw  --  Black under her breast . " On March 11 , 1806 , Clark made a journal entry that provided the mule deer with its modern name : " The ears and tail of this Animal when compared with those of the Common Deer whitetail , so well comported with those of the Mule when compared with the Horse , that we have by way of distinction adopted the appellation of Mule Deer . " The explorers saw their first pronghorn antelope in the summer of 1804 . Lewis and Clark often referred to pronghorns as " antilopes " or " goats . " On Sept. 17 , 1804 , Lewis noted : " We found the Antilope extreemly shye and watchfull insomuch that we had been unable to get a shot at them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I had this day an opportunity of witnessing the agility and superior fleetness of this anamal which was to me really astonishing . I had pursued and twice surprised a small herd of seven , in the first instance they did not discover me distinctly and therefore did not run at full speed , tho ' they took care before they rested to gain an elivated point where it was impossible to approach them under cover , except in one direction and that happened to be in the direction from which the wind blew towards them ; bad as the chance to approach them was , I made the best of my way towards them , frequently peeping over the ridge with which I took care to conceal myself from their view .... " The male , of which there was but one , frequently incircled the summit of the hill on which the females stood in a group , as if to look out for the approach of danger . I got within about 200 paces of them when they smelt me and fled ; I gained the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible from whence I had an extensive view of the country ... the antilopes which had disappeared in a steep revene now appeared at the distance of about three miles on the side of a ridge which passed obliquely across me and extended about four miles . So soon had these antelopes gained the distance at which they had again appeared to my view I doubted at ferst that they were the same that I just surprised , but my doubts soon vanished when I beheld the rapidity of their flight along the ridge before me ... it appeared reather the rappid flight of birds than the motion of quadrupeds . I think I can safely venture the asscertion that the speed of this anamal is equal if not superior to that of the finest blooded courser . " Some things never change , as those of us who hunt pronghorns today can attest .  --  Jim Zumbo For more information on the Lewis &; Clark Adventure , go to www.outdoorlife.com .
