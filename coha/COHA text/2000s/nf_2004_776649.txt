Preface to the 2004 Edition // Almost a decade has passed since this book was first published . As I mention in the original introduction , the opportunity to write the book came while I was in law school , the result of my election as the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review . In the wake of some modest publicity , I received an advance from a publisher and went to work with the belief that the story of my family , and my efforts to understand that story , might speak in some way to the fissures of race that have characterized the American experience , as well as the fluid state of identity - the leaps through time , the collision of cultures - that mark our modern life . // Like most first-time authors , I was filled with hope and despair upon the book ? s publication - hope that the book might succeed beyond my youthful dreams , despair that I had failed to say anything worth saying . The reality fell somewhere in between . The reviews were mildly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publisher arranged . The sales were underwhelming . And , after a few months , I went on with the business of my life , certain that my career as an author would be short-lived , but glad to have survived the process with my dignity more or less intact . // I had little time for reflection over the next ten years . I ran a voter registration project in the 1992 election cycle , began a civil rights practice , and started teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago . My wife and I bought a house , were blessed with two gorgeous , healthy , and mischievous daughters , and struggled to pay the bills . When a seat in the state legislature opened up in 1996 , some friends persuaded me to run for the office , and I won . I had been warned , before taking office , that state politics lacks the glamour of its Washington counterpart ; one labors largely in obscurity , mostly on topics that mean a great deal to some but that the average man or woman on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say , or the tax consequences of farm equipment depreciation ) . Nonetheless , I found the work satisfying , mostly because the scale of state politics allows for concrete results - an expansion of health insurance for poor children , or a reform of laws that send innocent men to death row - within a meaningful time frame . And too , because within the capitol building of a big , industrial state , one sees every day the face of a nation in constant conversation : inner-city mothers and corn and bean farmers , immigrant day laborers alongside suburban investment bankers - all jostling to be heard , all ready to tell their stories . // A few months ago , I won the Democratic nomination for a seat as the U.S. senator from Illinois . It was a difficult race , in a crowded field of well-funded , skilled , and prominent candidates ; without organizational backing or personal wealth , a black man with a funny name , I was considered a long shot . And so , when I won a majority of the votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as black , in the suburbs as well as Chicago , the reaction that followed echoed the response to my election to the Law Review . Mainstream commentators expressed surprise and genuine hope that my victory signaled a broader change in our racial politics . Within the black community , there was a sense of pride regarding my accomplishment , a pride mingled with frustration that fifty years after Brown v. Board of Education and forty years after the passage of the Voting Rights Act , we should still be celebrating the possibility ( and only the possibility , for I have a tough general election coming up ) that I might be the sole African American - and only the third since Reconstruction - to serve in the Senate . My family , friends , and I were mildly bewildered by the attention , and constantly aware of the gulf between the hard sheen of media reports and the messy , mundane realities of life as it is truly lived . // Just as that spate of publicity prompted my publisher ? s interest a decade ago , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? s re-publication . For the first time in many years , I ? ve pulled out a copy and read a few chapters to see how much my voice may have changed over time . I confess to wincing every so often at a poorly chosen word , a mangled sentence , an expression of emotion that seems indulgent or overly practiced . I have the urge to cut the book by fifty pages or so , possessed as I am with a keener appreciation for brevity . I can not honestly say , however , that the voice in this book is not mine - that I would tell the story much differently today than I did ten years ago , even if certain passages have proven to be inconvenient politically , the grist for pundit commentary and opposition research . // What has changed , of course , dramatically , decisively , is the context in which the book might now be read . I began writing against a backdrop of Silicon Valley and a booming stock market ; the collapse of the Berlin Wall ; Mandela - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead a country ; the signing of peace accords in Oslo . Domestically , our cultural debates - around guns and abortion and rap lyrics - seemed so fierce precisely because Bill Clinton ? s Third Way , a scaled-back welfare state without grand ambition but without sharp edges , seemed to describe a broad , underlying consensus on bread-and-butter issues , a consensus to which even George W. Bush ? s first campaign , with its " compassionate conservatism , " would have to give a nod . Internationally , writers announced the end of history , the ascendance of free markets and liberal democracy , the replacement of old hatreds and wars between nations with virtual communities and battles for market share . // And then , on September 11 , 2001 , the world fractured . // It ? s beyond my skill as a writer to capture that day , and the days that would follow - the planes , like specters , vanishing into steel and glass ; the slow-motion cascade of the towers crumbling into themselves ; the ash-covered figures wandering the streets ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the stark nihilism that drove the terrorists that day and that drives their brethren still . My powers of empathy , my ability to reach into another ? s heart , can not penetrate the blank stares of those who would murder innocents with abstract , serene satisfaction . // What I do know is that history returned that day with a vengeance ; that , in fact , as Faulkner reminds us , the past is never dead and buried - it isn ? t even past . This collective history , this past , directly touches my own . Not merely because the bombs of Al Qaeda have marked , with an eerie precision , some of the landscapes of my life - the buildings and roads and faces of Nairobi , Bali , Manhattan ; not merely because , as a consequence of 9/11 , my name is an irresistible target of mocking websites from overzealous Republican operatives . But also because the underlying struggle - between worlds of plenty and worlds of want ; between the modern and the ancient ; between those who embrace our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a set of values that binds us together , and those who would seek , under whatever flag or slogan or sacred text , a certainty and simplification that justifies cruelty toward those not like us - is the struggle set forth , on a miniature scale , in this book . // I know , I have seen , the desperation and disorder of the powerless : how it twists the lives of children on the streets of Jakarta or Nairobi in much the same way as it does the lives of children on Chicago ? s South Side , how narrow the path is for them between humiliation and untrammeled fury , how easily they slip into violence and despair . I know that the response of the powerful to this disorder - alternating as it does between a dull complacency and , when the disorder spills out of its proscribed confines , a steady , unthinking application of force , of longer prison sentences and more sophisticated military hardware - is inadequate to the task . I know that the hardening of lines , the embrace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so what was a more interior , intimate effort on my part , to understand this struggle and to find my place in it , has converged with a broader public debate , a debate in which I am professionally engaged , one that will shape our lives and the lives of our children for many years to come . // The policy implications of all this are a topic for another book . Let me end instead on a more personal note . Most of the characters in this book remain a part of my life , albeit in varying degrees - a function of work , children , geography , and turns of fate . // The exception is my mother , whom we lost , with a brutal swiftness , to cancer a few months after this book was published . // She had spent the previous ten years doing what she loved . She traveled the world , working in the distant villages of Asia and Africa , helping women buy a sewing machine or a milk cow or an education that might give them a foothold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from high and low , took long walks , stared at the moon , and foraged through the local markets of Delhi or Marrakesh for some trifle , a scarf or stone carving that would make her laugh or please the eye . She wrote reports , read novels , pestered her children , and dreamed of grandchildren . // We saw each other frequently , our bond unbroken . During the writing of this book , she would read the drafts , correcting stories that I had misunderstood , careful not to comment on my characterizations of her but quick to explain or defend the less flattering aspects of my father ? s character . She managed her illness with grace and good humor , and she helped my sister and me push on with our lives , despite our dread , our denials , our sudden constrictions of the heart . // I think sometimes that had I known she would not survive her illness , I might have written a different book - less a meditation on the absent parent , more a celebration of the one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughters I see her every day , her joy , her capacity for wonder . I won ? t try to describe how deeply I mourn her passing still . I know that she was the kindest , most generous spirit I have ever known , and that what is best in me I owe to her . //
