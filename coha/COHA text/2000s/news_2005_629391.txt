<p> HEATH Ledger is a manly guy . " I 'm pretty comfortable with where I 'm at in life , " he says in an amiable Australian-accented growl , and even over the telephone you can tell he 's smiling , the way men do at notions that are too outlandish to consider - in this case , the idea that so manly a man should fret over homophobes shunning his new movie . <p> Ledger plays a laconic Westerner in Brokeback Mountain , which opens Friday . His character , Ennis Del Mar , wears boots and rides horses . He looks like the Marlboro Man when we first see him , leaning against the side of a trailer , wearing low-slung jeans and road dust . <p> When Jake Gyllenhaal 's character drives up , the two wait in silence for another man , but they exchange glances . At this point , even if you did n't know Brokeback Mountain has been heralded as a groundbreaking " gay cowboy movie , " an alert viewer might surmise that these are n't the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are n't even cowboys . They 're sheepherders . But , never mind . John Wayne never eyed a man that way . <p> Movie critics have been beating the drums for Brokeback Mountain ever since it snagged the top prize at the Venice International Film Festival in September . Because of the level of talent both in front of and behind the camera , and the universal themes of its love story , it 's viewed as a potential big prize winner and very possibly the film to usher gay cinema into the mainstream . <p> Let 's acknowledge upfront the strangeness of discussing " gay cinema " with Ledger , who just had a baby with Michelle Williams ( his wife in the movie ) and whose cinematic lover ( Gyllenhaal ) was , until recently , romantically linked to Kirsten Dunst . Ledger will talk acting , but he is n't here to wave any rainbow banners . <p> But a little online surfing shows how excited advocacy groups and gay movie goers are about the film . It 's reaching screens amid a flurry of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has caused some industry wags to proclaim 2005 the " Year of the Gay in Hollywood . " <p> Friday saw the Houston premiere of The Dying Gaul , a psychological thriller starring Peter Saarsgard as a grief-stricken gay screenwriter who is seduced by Hollywood . The Friday after Mountain opens , two other gay-themed films arrive here - TransAmerica , in which Felicity Huffman plays a man who wants to become a woman , and Breakfast on Pluto , the most accomplished of the three , about a transvestite embroiled in Irish terrorism in the 1970s . <p> These come on the heels of Rent ; Capote ; Kiss Kiss , Bang Bang ; Heights and Happy Endings , all films with prominent gay characters or themes . <p> The irony , of course - aside from the flagrant straightness of its poster boys - is that this " Year of the Gay " follows a presidential election that many viewed as an endorsement of traditional values . <p> It would seem Hollywood missed the memo , that it 's out of touch with the mood of the heartland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executives did n't huddle in a smoky room and decide to launch a campaign , but the explosion of gay-related movies could well be a reaction to the ongoing national gay rights debate . <p> " There are filmmakers out there responding to societal rumblings , whether consciously or subconsciously , " Ledger says . <p> Neil Jordan agrees . The Irish director of both Breakfast on Pluto and The Crying Game compares the current American climate to the United Kingdom during the Thatcher years , when many British films had a political edge . Even those that were n't political were seen that way . <p> " Every movie was viewed as a kind of comment , whether it was or not . " he says . <p> WITH a script by Larry McMurtry , Brokeback Mountain is based on a short story by E. Annie Proulx that was published in the New Yorker in 1997 . Two sheepherders meet and fall in love in 1963 and spend most of the next 20 years living apart , raising families , seeing each other only for brief " fishing trips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , but no studio wanted to make it . <p> " The project was under a big , dark , angry cloud , " the actor says . <p> Ledger read the script and liked it . He decided not to worry about whether the public would accept the story or whether playing such a role could affect how he 's perceived . <p> " I would hope that ' the heartland , ' so to speak , is more mature than it 's made out to be , " he says . <p> For all the talk of politics and social issues , Brokeback Mountain is in many ways an old-fashioned romantic drama , although with a twist . It could become a political comment easily enough , though , if Hollywood gives it a best picture Oscar , as some are predicting . <p> Yet to be seen , however , is how the movie will fare with audiences . Ledger is being discussed as a likely best actor nominee for his portrayal of a man torn by conflicts , but a dismal showing could affect the movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in movies and , especially , on television in recent years , it would seem screen depictions of homosexuals have become commonplace . But mainstream theatrical movies most often depict gays as the comic sidekick or sympathetic best friend . Rarely are they the central characters . When they are , filmmakers are careful to make sure they 're not too gay , which is to say they rarely touch - unless , that is , they 're women . <p> Audiences love to watch women kiss , the thinking goes . But even in Philadelphia , the 1993 AIDS film that starred Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington , you could almost mistake Hanks ' lover ( Antonio Banderas ) for his cousin . <p> Audiences embraced The Crying Game in 1992 , but a lot of that had to do with clever marketing that exploited the " big surprise " that awaited movie goers near the end . Jordan 's new movie , Breakfast on Pluto , has no intimate scenes involving its star , Cillian Murphy . And except for some mild and very dignified flirting late in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Brokeback Mountain does n't play it coy . Ledger and Gyllenhaal do things up in those hills that marquee names have never before done in a mainstream movie . <p> The film 's last half is indeed a powerful love story that no one with a heart should be unaffected by . The question is : How many people , straight men in particular , will make it through the first half . <p> LEDGER says there was no discussion on the set about how far to take the sex scenes . <p> " It was pretty well described in the short story and script , " he says . " Everyone sort of knew where the story needed to go . Everyone , the actors and the director , were professionals and willing to throw themselves into the story and do it justice , so to speak , " he says . <p> As an actor , he says he identified an emotional objective for each scene . The actions served those objectives so that you can chart his character 's emotional evolution through the sex and post-sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex scenes in Pluto because they were n't necessary for the story he was telling . <p> Pluto , which also stars Liam Neeson , Stephen Rea and Brendan Gleeson , plays like an Irish updating of Candide , juxtaposing jarring violence with humor and whimsy . Murphy 's character wanders through a series of bleak situations but never loses his innocent , optimistic outlook . <p> " There 's no question who he is , " Jordan says , referring to the character 's sexuality . " This is not a story about somebody coming to terms with their sexuality at all . It 's a story about somebody preserving their sense of themselves . " <p> Though the tone is completely different , Pluto is set in the same milieu as The Crying Game . It 's also similar to other Jordan movies in that it deals with Irish terrorism , a recurring subject going back to his first film , Angel , in 1982 . The structure and tone sets it apart , however . <p> " I 'd never done an episodic sort of story , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of disparate events , " Jordan says . <p> Ang Lee , who directed Brokeback Mountain , also is returning to the sort of material he 's dealt with before . His second film , The Wedding Banquet ( 1993 ) , was about a gay landlord who marries a female tenant to please his parents . <p> Lee 's method in Mountain , however , is similar to Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon , his unlikely 2000 blockbuster . <p> Crouching Tiger succeeded by bringing together audiences of two genres - martial arts and melodrama - that could 've canceled each other out if handled poorly . That movie also borrowed heavily from American Westerns . In fact , despite its Eastern trappings , it is far closer than Brokeback Mountain to being a true Western in the John Wayne tradition . <p> The question Lee faces now is whether the audience for even a kinda sorta Western like Mountain will want to see a gay romance , and vice versa . <p> He finds out next weekend . <p> NOTES : eric.harrison@chron.com 1 .
