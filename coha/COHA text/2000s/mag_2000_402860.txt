Section : Militarize Space NOW ! When it comes to hard science , Richard Garwin and his " concerned scientists " are almost always wrong . <p> Physicist Richard Garwin is a naysayer . Ever since President Reagan unveiled his Strategic Defense Initiative on March 23 , 1983 , Garwin has been its leading critic , proclaiming it too costly , technologically impossible , and likely to fuel an accelerated arms race . Testifying on April 24 , 1984 , before Congress on behalf of the Union of Concerned Scientists ( UCS ) , Garwin argued that Reagan 's plan to build a space-based defense against Soviet missile attacks would require 2,400 satellite battle stations  --  at an estimated cost of a trillion dollars . Garwin 's trillion-dollar figure became an instant " fact " in the Democratic and media campaign to kill " Star Wars . " <p> Almost from day one , however , Garwin and the UCS began revising the numbers down : 2,400 satellite battle stations soon became 2,263 , then 965 , 800 , and finally 300  --  an almost 90 percent drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circles . <p> Asked today whether his original critiques of SDI were a mistake , however , Garwin emphatically answers " no , " claiming the controversy over SDI has n't hurt his reputation one bit . For those who value partisanship over scientific integrity , that is no doubt true . Indeed the New York Times recently hailed Garwin as the " renowned physicist " who is " known for being politically independent and outspoken . " <p> When it comes to hard scientific facts , however , Garwin and his colleagues have an almost unbroken track record of being wrong . Take chemical lasers , for example . Garwin and the UCS argued chemical lasers would require too much fuel and would be subject to too much atmospheric distortion to ever be workable . They insisted that pursuing the technology was a huge waste of time and resources . <p> Early this June , however , the jointly developed U.S.-Israeli Tactical High Energy Laser ( THEL ) tracked and destroyed a live Katyusha rocket . A more recent test , in late August , had the laser successfully take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Col. Ellen Pawlikowski , who is overseeing the U.S. airborne-laser program , told the Wall Street Journal in September : " Hey , we 're here , we 've done it . " <p> The UCS was equally skeptical of the hit-to-kill technology  --  commonly referred to as " hitting a bullet with a bullet "  --  by which rockets are designed to intercept and destroy oncoming enemy missiles . Garwin and company complained that a hit-to-kill defense was unworkable because , among other things , it " can function only in very high altitudes . " Wrong again . <p> Today there are several operational hit-to-kill systems . They range from the American Patriot PAC-3 missile , to the Israeli Arrow 2 ( which is not only operational but already deployed in Israel )  --  all of which operate at the low altitudes the UCS thought impossible . Technical feasibility is clearly not a significant impediment to hit-to-kill defenses . <p> Another big problem , said UCS , was programming : SDI supposedly needed way too many " lines of computer code " to program all the necessary computer functions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that SDI critics said in 1984 and 1985 that SDI would need " 10 million lines of computer code and so could not possibly be written in a way that makes it functional . " Yet today , says Graham , " much bigger codes are now routinely used in everyday applications . " Indeed , a typical office computer can handle about 100 million lines of code , and software programs like Microsoft Office employ about 65 million lines of code . " That argument , " says Graham , " has gone away . " <p> Though most of the arguments against missile defense are disappearing , the same can not be said of its critics . <p> Nobel Prize-winning physicist Hans Bethe , who worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II , concedes that some advancement has been made since the 1980 's  --  " We have shown in the Gulf War it is possible to hit designated targets from far away "  --  but still insists an overall missile defense is not feasible . <p> Though Bethe could not recall the specific numbers that UCS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulated by Dick Garwin . Told that Garwin stands by all his calculations , Bethe said " I firmly believe also " that the figures were correct . <p> Other longtime critics are even less nuanced in their estimations . John Pike of the Federation of American Scientists ( FAS ) , for example , remains adamant that SDI is impracticable . When asked if technological developments have led him to even slightly rethink his critique of SDI , Pike responded with a simple " no . " <p> Pike even stands by his estimate in 1985 that SDI 's cost would be equivalent to paying for a " new Navy . " " At the time , " he explains , " there were plausible estimates for a total system cost of about a trillion dollars . " Asked whose " plausible estimates " they were , Pike claimed the one trillion dollar figure came from " internal Strategic Defense Initiative Organization SDIO estimates . " <p> There was , however , never any trillion-dollar estimate  --  internal or external  --  touted by the SDIO . The popular trillion-dollar figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Neill , who worked with the SDIO in the 1980 's , says their actual estimate for the total cost of implementation was around $100 billion . <p> The errors of the UCS are long forgotten , but they should n't be . They remain a lesson to all those Americans concerned about the dangers of rogue missiles or terrorist attacks  --  in part , because the enemies of an American missile shield continue to invoke the names of these critics . In letters to President Clinton , congressional testimony , and in " scientific " reports about missile defense , they offer much the same pseudo-scientific arguments as they did against Star Wars . <p> In July , the Federation of American Scientists released a letter drafted by Hans Bethe and signed by 50 Nobel Laureates ( one in economics incidentally , the rest hard science ) opposing a National Missile Defense system : " The system would offer little protection and would do grave harm to this nation 's core security interests . " <p> Clearly science is n't the main issue here . As Hans Bethe admitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't primarily scientific " but turns on political and strategic matters . Which begs the question : If these scientists ca n't even get their science right , why should we take them seriously on matters vital to our nation 's defense ? <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Arrow missiles for Israel , but nothing for us . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : THEL chemical laser shoots down two Russian Katyusha rockets in rapid succession in the desert . <p> By Evan Gahr <p> <p> Evan Gahr , a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute , writes often for TAS <p> <p>
