TOM ABERCROMBIE 1930-2006 Sixty years ago , a 15-year-old boy in Stillwater , Minnesota , accompanied his older brother to the town 's Lumberjack Days parade . A pilot just back from World War II , the older brother , whose name was Bruce , brought along the Leica camera he 'd purchased in Italy , and began taking pictures of the floats . His younger brother watched for a while , got bored , and wandered off in search of something more interesting . He noticed a boy on the curb , making faces at the girls on the floats . " Hey , Bruce , " called the younger brother , " that 's what you should be taking pictures of ! " Later he borrowed his brother 's Leica , made a drawing of it , and built a camera out of mirrors , a discarded lens , and scraps of plastic . His first photograph was of his girlfriend , Lynn . Thus began the journalistic passion of Thomas J. Abercrombie , who died recently at age 75 , after retiring in 1994 from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent , taught him four languages , brought him near death more times than he cared to count , and yielded 43 articles for this magazine , including some of the most ambitious ever published . During his 38 years on the staff , Abercrombie reported as a writer and photographer from Japan and Cambodia , Tibet and Venezuela , Spain and Australia , Alaska and Brazil , and as the first photojournalist ever from the South Pole . But his most significant and enduring contribution surely lies in the 16 articles he produced on the Muslim world between 1956 and 1994 , which guided GEOGRAPHIC 'S readers through the glorious and tangled geography of what may be , now as then , the closest thing the Western world has to terra incognita . Abercrombie came to the Society in 1956 , after a brief stint in the Army ( scuttled by a foot fungus , which he 'd picked up lifeguarding ) and work as a photographer for two midwestern newspapers , the Fargo Forum and the Milwaukee Journal . Hard news coverage earned him Newspaper Photographer of the Year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a backyard bird-a robin tugging at a worm-that won the heart of GEOGRAPHIC 'S Melville Bell Grosvenor , who said the picture could only have been taken by another robin . Abercrombie flunked his GEOGRAPHIC physical-those feet again-but Editorial overruled Medical , and Tom was hired . He had never traveled outside the United States , but on his first overseas assignment , to Lebanon , he found that a short , gruff , goodnatured man from Minnesota could strike up a conversation with just about anybody . He interviewed Lebanon 's president , Camille Chamoun , and made the notoriously stiff Chamoun so comfortable that he invited Tom to photograph him and his wife sprawled under a tree . And in a Lebanese town , Qabb Ilyas , he made his first visit to a mosque , an epiphany of sorts that he later described in the article : " After the service I mingled with the people , drifting with the human current out the door past a long line of beggars and down the narrow street . Walking and talking with them , I had a warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of their own . " That moment , or something like it , played out thousands of times during Tom Abercrombie 's career , which brought him into close and welcome contact with the people of more than 80 nations . He often likened himself to a oneman army when he set off into the field-in a customized Land Rover with metal gas cans lashed to the roof , a dozen or more hard cases , water jugs , sleeping bags , books , duct tape , baling wire , topographic maps , shrinkwrapped rations , mounds of pipe tobacco , and , depending on local circumstances , a firearm or two-but humanity was his secret weapon . " Abercrombie was tough as nails , but he was incredibly gentle with people , " says retired GEOGRAPHIC photographer Jim Stanfield , who traveled the Sahara with Tom in a 400-camel caravan . " He was a world-class listener . He 'd spend hours talking to some guy in a coffee shop , smoking his pipe and yakking about this and that . He had a great mind , and infinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they trusted him . Even when he did n't speak their language , he always found a way to connect . " In eastern Afghanistan , for example , he fell in with a group of men playing buzkashi , the traditional Afghan sport of galloping horses , calf carcasses , and bloody , horse-to-horse combat . " The way I got chummy with the players , who are not a real chummy bunch , was that I was photographing and a horse chewed one of these guy 's ears right off , " Abercrombie , who cursed like a sailor , told a reporter in 1998 . " I had this hell of a first aid kit I carried around . I had damn near a hospital , this huge fishing tackle box full of morphine and sharpened scalpels . So I fixed this guy 's ear up and made him feel a little better . " Abercrombie 's medical exploits were legendary . There was the amputation , with a pocketknife , of a pilgrim 's gangrenous toes in Tibet , his emergency care of survivors after an earthquake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speeding truck piled high with passengers flipped over on a highway in Nigeria . His expense accounts , too , elicited gasps from his colleagues , especially those in Accounting . Yet the man who listed two AK-47s as " auto insurance " on his expense report from Yemen , presented the occasional gift of a sheep or goat to a Bedouin host , or bought a Cessna 185 to fly himself around Alaska was merely being practical . An early audit of his accounts by headquarters revealed a miserly average daily expenditure on meals and hotels of $17.52 . Tom , of Scottish blood , thought that a bit high . This was , after all , a man who wrote his stories on the backs of earlier manuscripts , and wore his pencils down to the nub . His home woodworking shop is a monument to thrift , littered with hoarded wood scraps and illuminated by handmade shop lights with shades of recycled aluminum pie plates . Favored by genetics-he hailed from a line of civil engineers-Abercrombie also made his mark as a field mechanic . Once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterproof housing for his camera out of Plexiglas and used it to photograph a Lake Michigan shipwreck for the newspaper . His boss in Milwaukee , Bob Gilka ( who later became GEOGRAPHIC 'S director of photography ) , recalls that Tom and his wife , Lynn , drove their car as close to the water 's edge as possible . " Then Tom tied one end of a long rope to the bumper , the other end around his waist , and waded out into the lake with his homemade underwater camera to test it . He and Lynn had worked out a plan : If there was trouble , he would signal by pulling on the rope-Lynn 's cue to start the car and pull Tom out of the lake . " He liked being married . In the Empty Quarter of Arabia , Tom and Lynn were traveling together when a local sheikh decided to claim Lynn , a tall , striking brunette he assumed to be Tom 's daughter , as wife number four . He offered 30 camels for her . Tom countered with 50 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed together . " I really needed Lynn , " Tom later explained . " And what would I do with 50 camels ? " Such trips together were rare in the early years . Though a GEOGRAPHIC photographer herself , Lynn was busy raising their daughter , Mari , and son , Bruce , at the couple 's waterfront home in Maryland . So Tom often traveled alone , thousands of miles from home for months at a time . Yet whatever spare time he had went to writing long , tender letters to his " Rabbits " back home , or filling his suitcases with exotic knickknacks from the local suq to spring on them when he came through the front door . By the mid-1960s , Tom was spending so much time in the Middle East that it was clear he 'd found his niche . He mastered Arabic ( along with German , French , and Spanish ) , read the Koran , and adopted an Arabic name , Omar , on his travels . But he was not , to anyone 's knowledge , religious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Editor in Chief Melville Grosvenor , dated April 17,1965 . It was Tom , writing from Mecca : " Greetings and best wishes from Islam 's holiest city . I 've just had the singular honor to witness , to cover photographically , and to participate in one of the most moving experiences known to man , the annual pilgrimage to Mecca and Arafat . It has been an unforgettable personal experience and , without a doubt , the climax of our coverage of Saudi Arabia . " Tom was intensely private about his conversion to Islam and making the hajj to Mecca . But there 's no doubt that his faith was genuine , and that it connected him personally to the world 's Muslims . It also inspired him , through his work , to build bridges of understanding between the Islamic world and the West . Tom once said that his proudest professional accomplishment was writing and photographing " The Sword and the Sermon , " his epic journey through the history and culture of the Muslim world that appeared in the July 1972 issue . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mosque in Alma Ata and attended Friday prayers . In a letter home he described it , with typical understatement , as one of the most emotional experiences of his life . " I introduced myself to the sheikh , and as we talked in Arabic the growing congregation of old Kazakhs , magnificent in their costumes and manners , began to gather around . When I showed them pictures of Mecca and the pilgrimage they were damn near crying . Many rubbed their hands on my clothes and then on their face for what blessing a hajji might bring . I was pretty choked up . " Crowned with such experiences , Tom 's GEOGRAPHIC career came to a close in 1994 , and his family prepared , with some anxiety , for his homecoming . " Tom was never happier than when he was getting ready for an assignment-packing , studying maps , making plans , " Lynn said , " so I did n't know what to expect when he retired . But he never looked back . He loved being home , building his boats , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . He 'd go off on a walk and be gone for two or three hours , because he 'd gotten caught up talking to a neighbor , or some perfect stranger he 'd met on the road . But in general , he just went native . " Tom toiled over his memoirs , a PG-rated version of the long , hilarious , self-deprecating tales he 'd been telling over the lunch table for decades-although writing them down , a lonely business , was n't nearly as much fun as telling them . His sagas did find a new audience at George Washington University , where he taught " geography with its boots on , " and at the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC office , where the next generation of writers and photographers always greeted his arrival as cause for celebration . Tom was a generous mentor , and on my own trips to the Middle East I followed his trail into deserts and back alleys from Jalalabad to Damascus . There I often found people who knew him and were his friends , and who welcomed me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The last few months of his life he spent pursuing his latest passion-stargazing-with the enthusiasm of a kid watching a parade . Even in the dead of winter , Tom , in his beret , was out in the backyard practically every night , studying the heavens through a telescope Lynn bought him for Christmas . The engineer in him , typically , spotted ways to improve the machinery , and he 'd soon jury-rigged a new mount for it using parts from another telescope . Just before his own machinery gave out , he was scanning the sky charts and reading every book about the cosmos he could find . Knowing Tom Abercrombie , I 'd say he was just plotting his next expedition . Sidebar <p>
