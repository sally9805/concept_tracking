Introduction Dean Wesley Smith After I turned in my selections of wonderful stories for Elisa and Paula to judge for this year 's anthology , Elisa and I were discussing ideas for my introduction . She suggested that maybe I should talk about the fortieth anniversary of Star Trek : The Original Series . My initial reaction was : Forty years ? Wow . That 's fantastic ! Then a second thought came to mind . That 's not possible . I 'm not that old . But I am . I can recall every Friday evening during my high school years . I would always be home to watch Star Trek . ( Okay , that should give you a pretty good idea of what my social life was like when I was a teenager , but let 's not go there . ) Suffice it to say , Star Trek was an important element in my life during those years . In hindsight , I realize that the reason I would insist on watching the show every week was clear : I did n't like being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid really does ? Star Trek gave me an escape , in much the same fashion as the shelves and shelves of Andre Norton , Edgar Rice Burroughs , and Robert Heinlein books in my basement bedroom . Star Trek and all of those other books took me out of thathouse  --  out of that teenage life that everybody hates  --  to strange new places , distant planets , and awesome adventures . Science fiction , with its wonderful worlds , futures , and messages of hope , was what I turned to for a few hours of not thinking about the world around me . More importantly , though , it let me believe that a better future was possible . Remember the world in which Star Trek was born ? The cities of this country were going up in flames , and bombs were going off so often that only the regional ones were reported . Martin Luther King , Jr. , and Bobby Kennedy were shot . Nixon was elected to his first term . And the war just kept getting bigger and bigger . I believed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would be drafted , when I got out of high school . To me , it also meant that I would eventually be shot at and maybe killed . That I would be drafted in the fall of 1969 seemed inevitable . It was a fact that all guys thought about a great deal in those days . We did n't talk about it much , though . It was just too scary to talk about . I was one of those who did n't believe the war was right , but I also did n't believe in copping out by cutting and running . So there I was , stuck in a life I did n't much like , with a future of war and likely death facing me . So , you can see why I made it home every Friday night to watch the original Star Trek . And I have a pretty good memory of writing a letter when they tried to cancel the show in 1968 . I ca n't imagine what I would have thought if some time traveler had walked up to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will have managed to stay out of Vietnam . You will have written over twenty Star Trek novels , edited several Star Trek anthologies for new writers , and written a few Star Trek scripts . " I 'm sure I would have just laughed . Being a part , even a minor part , of such a unique show would never have crossed my mind in 1966 . About thirteen years ago , my wife and I got the chance to join in creating some of this wonderful universe , and we jumped at it . Writing under the name Sandy Schofield , we wrote Star Trek : Deep Space Nine : The Big Game . Suddenly , I was a Star Trek writer . And it 's such a high for me that I get to give new writers out there the same chance . In nine volumes , there have been almost two hundred new Star Trek stories . Over one hundred different writers have joined in inventing Star Trek , the Next Generation , Deep Space Nine , Voyager , and Enterprise . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans , can talk about the influence Star Trek , in every incarnation , had in their lives , just as I can . The shows , now shown in syndication , continue to influence future generations as well . With the world becoming a little rougher than it has been the last few decades , we now need the wonderful vision of the future that Star Trek brings us even more . We need the escape , the hope , and the belief that mankind goes forward . At the moment , we only have the books and games that can bring Star Trek and its hope and vision to all of us . You hold it in your hand . You are the cutting edge of Star Trek  --  written by the fans , people like you and me , who love this universe almost more than our real one . For forty exceptional years , Star Trek has given us all a look ahead , a wonderful escape into a great universe . So sit back , turn off the news , and let a few of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future . You wo n't want to come home . Continues ...
