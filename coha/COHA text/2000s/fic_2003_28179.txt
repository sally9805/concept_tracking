And what a people loves it will defend . We took their temples from them and forbade them , for many years , to worship their strange idols . They gathered in secret , deep in the dripping glens , Chanting their prayers before a lichened rock . - John Hewitt , " The Colony , " 1950 There he is , three days after his fifth birthday , standing barefoot upon wet summer grass . He is staring at the house where he lives : the great good Irish place of whitewashed walls , long and low , with a dark slate roof glistening in the morning drizzle . Standing there , he knows it will turn pale blue when the sun appears to work its magic . The boy named Robert Carson loves gazing at that house , basking in its permanence and comfort . On some days , a wisp of smoke rises from the chimney . On other days , the earlymorning sun throws a golden glaze upon its white facade . It is never the same and always the same . He sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , the glass reflecting the rising sun . The front door is mahogany , salvaged from some drowned ship along the shores of the Irish Sea , as tightly fitted in that doorway now as any man could make it . There 's a low half-door too , placed in front of the full mahogany door like a snug wooden apron . During balmy summer days , the large door is always open , welcoming light and air into the house . The breeze pushes smoke from the fire up through the stone chimney . Robert Carson goes in , flipping the iron latches made by his father , whose name is John Carson and is called simply Da . The house is as it always is and as the boy thinks it will always be . A sweet odor of burning turf fills the air . He breathes it deeply , inhaling the ancient burned mud of the swamps beside Lough Neagh , where the peat was cut from the bog . Directly facing him is the jamb wall , running from floor to ceiling along the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into its pine boards so that he and his father and mother can observe the approach of strangers . The boy can only do this by standing on the shoulder of the hearth . The hearth is at the end of a large main room , but it is the center of the house , the holy place that holds the fire . A wide iron canopy rises above the hearth , carrying away the smoke , and on damp , chilly days the boy sits on one of the hand-carved low benches beside the fire . The family has few visitors , but men always sit on the right , facing the fire , so the boy does the same . The women take the bench on the left , and his mother is always there . Her name is Rebecca , but he calls her Ma . He thinks of them as a unit : Ma , Da , and me . The Carsons . To the left of the hearth is the small iron crane his father made in the forge , with its arms of different lengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pots back and forth , in and out of the flame , while the odors of stews and porridges and soups overwhelm the sweetness of the burning turf . There are two low threelegged chairs called " creepies , " cousins of milking stools . Built low in the days before chimney flues so that farmers could breathe below the smoke . One day he lifted a creepy , examined the perfect pegs that held the legs so permanently to the seat , and hugged it to his chest , thinking : This is ours , this belongs to the Carsons . Back about five feet from the hearth is his father 's own chair , made of woven rush , looking like a throne designed as a beehive . Robert Carson never sits in his father 's chair . Beside his father 's chair is one of the many wrought-iron light holders that John Carson made in the forge , long iron poles with four arched feet and hooks that hold lanterns for his reading . They never wobble on the flagstone floor , never lose their dignity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see with his eyes shut the objects that occupy its oiled surface : his father 's clay pipes , with their long curved stems , an old thatched horse collar that Da saved from his own youth , a carved wooden cup called a noggin , found in the mud of a bog . Da has told the boy that the noggin is a thousand years old , and Robert Carson is certain that his father is right . To the left , a mound of turf bricks rises off the floor , dried out of dark black bottom mud . The iron tools of the fire , smaller cousins of the light holders , stand as rigid as sentries . All are part of the hearth , where the fire burns low but is never allowed to go out . As the center of the house , the hearth gives off warmth and food , and is the place to which the Carsons turn in the evenings for talk and even song . On his birthday , while they faced the hearth , his mother told the boy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born on the ninth of September . " Do you see , son ? You were born on the ninth day of the ninth month , " his mother said , " and as you grow up , lad , you 'll learn : Nine will be your number . " Sometimes on rainy afternoons , when his father is working in the forge , the boy 's mother sits beside the fire to drink tea and eat oat bread while she tells stories . The boy listens silently , the stories entering him in such a way that he later thinks they have happened to him , that he has lived them . Sometimes he drowses , while her voice makes a kind of music . They are the first stories of his life , written on a five-year-old 's emptiness . He is awake and asleep at the same time , listening to the magical words , while becoming through his mother 's magic the people in the stories . The fire burns steadily in the hearth , and his mother tells him that the fire should never be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul leaves the house . Da agrees . There were houses in Ireland , he said once , where the fire had burned day and night for more than a hundred years . In this house , he said , it had burned since John and Rebecca Carson moved in , long ago , before the boy was born . Even as she whispers stories , his mother gazes at the fire , as if seeing people or things unseen by others . Robert Carson later learns that before he was born there were two other children , his brothers , who were born and then died in another house . And when they died , Da poured water into the hearth and moved to this place to begin again . Robert Carson tries ( after learning this when he is eight ) to imagine those lost brothers , but no faces ever come clear . In bad dreams they have heads with shiny surfaces but no eyes or noses or mouths , and those visions wake him from his sleep . Sometimes he is terrified . To the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother and father sleep each night . A dresser stands outside the door , its drawers holding clothes . On its top there 's a wooden tray of knives and forks and spoons , along with a clump of gorse or primrose standing in water in the family 's only piece of delft : a tall vase decorated with tulips . Sometimes the boy traces with his fingers the designs on the vase , and caresses its smooth surface . Above the dresser three shelves are cut into the wall , stacked with terra-cotta plates and cups and bowls made by hand in the Mountains of Mourne . To the left is the back door , leading to the West . The room is dominated by the table behind the chairs that face the hearth , its dark planed top burnished by endless cleanings and oilings . Sometimes he stares at the back door , the one that opens to the West . He knows that no stranger should ever leave through the back door because he would take with him the luck of the house . He knows too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coffin must leave through that same back door , to be taken to the West , to the setting sun and the blackness that follows . On the ceiling , great beams cut from bog oak form a huge A , supporting the layers of thatch and sod , tied firmly with fir rods , that lie beneath the slates . His father built this house to last . The roof rests on towers of chiseled stone that form the gable ends , each slab thirty inches thick , cut so fine that they fit together without mortar . The walls are brick , stone , cut rushes that had soured , all bound together and made smooth by river mud and lime wash . They are two feet thick . A house built like a fortress . Even when he is alone , he is safe . ( Continues ... )
