<p> If the U.S. Supreme Court does someday reverse Roe versus Wade , a large share of the credit , or blame , is likely to go to the one family most responsible for reshaping the court  --  the Bushes . <p> Between them , George Bush the Elder and George Bush the Younger will have nominated at least four out of the nine justices , including Bush 's pending nominee to replace moderate Sandra Day O'Connor , the swing vote on abortion cases . There 's no guarantee how new Chief Justice John Roberts or nominee Samuel Alito , if confirmed , will rule , but many court observers predict a court more skeptical of a constitutional right to privacy , much less any constitutional guarantee to unfettered access to abortion . <p> Although abortion activists on both sides have conspired to cast Bush as a fervent crusader on this issue , there 's evidence to suggest that the current president may be less of an ideologue on the subject than he is a political pragmatist . <p> Certainly the history of the Bush dynasty suggests a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government in human reproduction . <p> Care to guess who was the treasurer of Planned Parenthood when it launched its first national fundraising campaign in 1947 ? It was Prescott Bush , father and grandfather of the two Bush presidents . <p> The political repercussions hit hard . Prescott Bush was knocked out of an expected victory for a Senate seat in Connecticut in 1950 after syndicated columnist Drew Pearson declared that it " has been made known " that Bush was a leader in the " Birth Control Society " ( The old name of Planned Parenthood had been the Birth Control Federation of America . ) Recall that contraceptives were controversial in those days  --  and remember that a constitutional right to use them was n't established until 1965 , when the Supreme Court affirmed an implied right to privacy in Griswold vs . Connecticut . <p> Prescott Bush won a Senate seat two years later , and his son George and daughter-in-law Barbara continued to support Planned Parenthood even after George 's election to Congress from Texas . In fact , he was such an advocate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rubbers . " <p> But as he began to position himself for the White House within the increasingly conservative GOP , he gradually began to identify himself as averse to abortion  --  first by opposing Medicare funding for abortion except in cases of rape , incest or to save the life of the mother , and ultimately by acceding to presidential nominee Ronald Reagan 's demand that , as his vice presidential nominee , Bush embrace the GOP platform 's call for a constitutional amendment against abortion . <p> Bush 's explanations for the about-face varied over time . Sometimes he said he was appalled to discover how frequently abortions were performed . Other times he said his own son Marvin 's adoption of two children started the evolution . <p> His wife , Barbara , mostly held her tongue about abortion while first lady , but it was easy to infer from what she did say that she favored abortion rights . Later , like Nancy Reagan , she broke her silence to say that she thought government had no business dictating what women do with their own bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of platforms at conventions , " she said . " You can argue yourself blue in the face , and you 're not going to change each other 's minds . It 's a waste of your time and my time . " <p> The current president has another formative woman in his life who is pro-choice . Just before his inauguration in 2001 , Laura Bush was asked in an interview on the " Today " show whether she favored a woman 's right to abortion . <p> " I agree with my husband that we should try to reduce the number of abortions in our country by doing all of those things , by taking responsibility , by talking about abstinence . " Yes , pressed interviewer Katie Couric , but what about Roe vs . Wade ? <p> " No , I do n't think that it should be overturned . " <p> It was a revealing comment , given that during the campaign she refused to share her opinions , only acknowledging that " In general , George and I are on the same page on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualms about overturning Roe outright . He has defined himself as believing in " a culture of life , " but as a presidential candidate , he also told the Associated Press : " I 'm a realistic enough person to know that America is not ready to ban abortions . America as a country is not prepared to send a message to senators and House members that we want you to do this  --  we want you to amend the Constitution . " <p> President Bush has made a few gestures to appease abortion opponents by constricting abortion availability in small ways that have n't caused a political ruckus . <p> Earlier this year , for example , he advocated a bill making it a federal crime for doctors or other adults to help minors cross state lines to get an abortion in states that do n't require parental notification . <p> His reluctance to push for an abortion ban is understandable . Bush is a politician , after all , and Americans tell pollsters they support Roe , generally by nearly 2 to 1 . <p> And like other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOP 's " no gain , no pain " theory of abortion politics : The culture of life gets trumped by the culture of electability . <p> Until last month , it was plausible he would feint right and stay center , just as his father and Reagan had done before him . Each had touted an intention to erase Roe while placing justices on the bench who did the opposite . <p> As Democratic consultant Francis Wilkinson has wryly written , " There are various theories to explain these instances of Sudden Pro-Choice Syndrome , but no clear explanation . It 's the darnedest thing , but when it comes to the most sacred cause in the Republican canon , the right to life , Republican presidents somehow find a way to mess up . You 'd almost think they were doing it on purpose . " <p> Activists on each side of the abortion wars conspired to reinforce the perception that Bush would act to eliminate Roe . That tantalizing promise  --  or ominous threat , depending on your perspective  --  electrified some voters and kept contributions flowing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in essence welshing on his promise  --  that bench nominee Harriet Miers was not an iron-clad , arch-foe of Roe  --  they turned on Bush with a vengeance . They simply had reached the point of exasperation with a species of GOP politician that essayist Hendrik Hertzberg dubbed " closet moderates . " <p> And so , boxed in by his own rhetoric and the need to mollify his base , Bush accepted Miers ' withdrawal and nominated to the court a conservative jurist seen as much more likely to be skeptical of Roe , a man whose mother says is " of course " opposed to abortion , and one who wrote 20 years ago that the Constitution provides no right to abortion . Even so , as a conservative jurist , Alito may be reluctant either to mix his personal beliefs with his legal analysis or to disregard long-standing precedent . <p> Ideology aside , Bush 's brain trust knows who is the prime political beneficiary if Roe goes : the Democratic Party . Absent Roe , the decision reverts to the states , and the political calculus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverts to the Democrats . <p> Which is why many legal experts consider it more likely that the reconstituted Supreme Court will allow Roe to stand while whittling away at its applications . This has two advantages  --  it would respect the legal principle of stare decisis while restricting access in ways that are politically popular . <p> A CBS News poll during the summer found that only about a quarter of American adults believe abortion should be permitted in all cases . A Pew Research Center poll at about the same time found that only about a third of respondents said abortion should be " generally available , " while nearly two-thirds said it should be more strictly limited or banned totally . <p> When it comes to parental notification  --  the key issue in a New Hampshire case now on the Supreme Court docket  --  surveys show Americans favor a law requiring at least one parent be told , by a whopping 80 to 20 percent . <p> So , as a purely political question , the best abortion foes can hope for is that the new court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abortions are available . <p> " Tiny gains , no pain "  --  in the politics of abortion , it 's a legacy George W. Bush might actually want . <p> CORRECTION-DATE : November 27 , 2005 <p> CORRECTION : <p> In last Sunday 's Insight section , the story " The Bush dynasty and Roe vs . Wade , " referred imprecisely to an element in George H.W. Bush 's evolving position on abortion 25 years ago , when he gradually began to identify himself as opposed to Medicaid funding for abortions except in cases of rape or incest , or to save the life of the mother .
