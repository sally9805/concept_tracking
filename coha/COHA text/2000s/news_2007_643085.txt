<p> When the United States Open begins this week at Oakmont Country Club outside Pittsburgh , a challenging , manicured golf course will be only part of the scene . <p> More striking will be the transformation of the grounds into a temporary metropolis of corporate tents , merchandise vendors , provisional roads , grandstands , concessions , hospitality centers , news media facilities , security outposts and every conceivable public service from baggage claim to bug-bite care . Supervised by a staff numbering in the thousands , the United States Open is far more than a golf tournament ; it is an extravagant American sporting spectacle rising out of a lush field like a mirage . <p> Authentic as it may be , the once-a-year manifestation of the Open obscures an unseen , sophisticated operation that precedes the first golf shot in competition by seven to eight years . <p> About 300 miles east of Oakmont , in the Philadelphia suburbs , is Merion Golf Club , the host of the 2013 Open . At Merion , and in the adjacent streets , towns and even at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tournament is going to transform a sleepy suburb into a small city for a week . Maps and overlays have been drawn , train and traffic schedules rethought , neighborhood schematics readied and many millions of dollars allocated from the budget of the United States Golf Association , sponsor of the Open . <p> A typical United States Open is estimated to net more than $25 million for the association , so cost is hardly an obstacle if it keeps the project moving along . For example , Merion , which was host to its first U.S.G.A. championship in 1904 , is wedged into tight quarters and will have to rely on the benevolence of its closest neighbors , most significantly Haverford College . <p> Beginning in 2012 , the college has agreed to give up the use of three of its athletic fields , including the varsity softball field , so the U.S.G.A. will have time to erect the platforms , roads , colossal tents and utility services for the cynosure of the event to many visitors : the five-acre corporate tent village . <p> The college will receive an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as some passes , a hospitality tent and a promise to restore the fields to their original condition . Still , that left the softball team without a field for one season . <p> No worries . The U.S.G.A. found a simple municipal field a short walk from the campus and agreed to pay for its renovation to meet the standards of Haverford 's flourishing softball program . <p> " You learn quickly that the U.S.G.A. does n't mess around ; they are a well-oiled machine , " said Ron Tola , Haverford College 's director of facilities management . " I was awe-struck by the advance planning . Then again , when you go to an Open , and you walk into one of those giant buildings that they call corporate tents , you realize what you 're dealing with . <p> " There 's black walnut furniture in those tents and every other amenity . My wife would say , ' Give me this for my living room , and I 'll be happy . ' They call it a corporate village ; it 's really a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually visit a potential host site seven to eight years before play is to begin . At Merion in the past year , the U.S.G.A. has met with local public transportation officials to review how the nearby rail lines could deliver many of the 25,000 spectators expected daily . <p> Officials have begun devising a strategy for parking about 15,000 cars in outlying areas . ( The Villanova University campus several miles away is one option . ) <p> The U.S.G.A. has met with Haverford township officials and begun to rally a force of more than 5,000 volunteers . And it has asked about 20 families living in homes abutting the course to allow corporate tents to sprout in their yards . The homeowners could be paid enough to cover their mortgages for two or three months . <p> The Open is primarily about identifying a national champion , but it is also a perfect merger of powerful entities : golf culture and corporate America . <p> Because of that , and other reasons like golf 's popularity in the Tiger Woods era , the Open has become a cash machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but recent federal tax records show it reported about $40 million in annual profits from its 16 championships . ( The U.S.G.A. also puts on men 's , women 's and junior amateur championships as well as the United States Women 's Open . ) The bulk of that profit , perhaps as much as 75 percent , comes from the United States Open . <p> A 2004 article in Golf Digest estimated that the 55 to 70 corporate tents at a typical Open rented for about $150,000 each . The massive merchandise tent , as big as a football field , brought in $7 million in revenue , according to the magazine . Television kicked in as much as another $20 million and ticket sales another $10.5 million . Those numbers have remained steady . <p> Mike Butz , the deputy executive director of the U.S.G.A. , did not discuss the financial details of the Open but acknowledged that the revenue had to be high to cover the expenses . <p> " I think the only other sports event that compares in terms of advance planning is the Olympics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously bigger , but each of their venues is like putting on a U.S. Open . And probably like a successful Olympics , it only works if the community hosting things buys into it completely . " <p> In the late 1990s , the U.S.G.A. told Merion it would probably not be the site of another Open . The modern version of the event , some said , had grown too big for the old , traditional courses like Merion , which held its last Open in 1981 . <p> " I think the club and the community around us took that as a challenge , " said Rick Ill , the president of Merion Golf Club . " We lengthened some holes , and that solved one part of things , but the incredible community collaboration is truly what made this happen . It could n't have happened , for sure , without Haverford College giving up its three fields . " <p> Greg Kannerstein , the dean of the college , remembers being shocked that the availability of Haverford 's grassy fields could be the deal-breaker . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kannerstein said . " But we all felt kind of badly that Merion would n't be part of the Open rotation , and we knew we wanted to help . " <p> Haverford 's incoming president , Dr. Stephen Emerson , had one complaint about the arrangement . <p> " I do wish they had included golf lessons targeted specifically for the college president , " Emerson said . " Then again , had they seen what a project they would be taking on , the whole thing might have fallen through . Maybe it 's best to leave things in the hands of the professionals . " <p> A U.S.G.A. task force will descend on the campus and community in about five years , even living in campus housing while working . The temporary city will rise in the fields like a mirage . Then , after a boisterous week , it will begin to disappear . <p> Somewhere , the 2020 United States Open will have taken seed . <p> #
