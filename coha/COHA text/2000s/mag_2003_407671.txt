" SCHOOL IS NOT GOING TO MEAN ANYTHING to a child unless she can see herself as an individual in the class . " This insight comes from Pat Smith , a resource teacher at Halifax 's Oxford School , with 30 years ' experience teaching the youngest grades . She believes parents and teachers can and should work together to help foster that sense of uniqueness . So where do you start ? Pat Garagan , a parent of three children attending school in Ladner , BC , starts in September . She makes a point of finding a convenient time during the first month of school to briefly introduce herself to each teacher . " I want teachers to put a face to my name and an extra face to Mark 's or Katie 's name . I like teachers to know I 'm available and concerned . I like to mention to Mark 's teacher , for example , that if he 's flipping a pencil it does n't mean he 's not paying attention . Actually , he focuses better if he has something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information teachers welcome , confirms Lorraine Prince , principal of Bala Avenue Community School in Toronto . " Teachers in my school identify two kinds of information : the kind they need to know right away and the kind that can wait a few weeks until they get to know your child , " she says . " Any health or dietary information , a family crisis or a certain kind of behavioural issue , they want to know as soon as possible , verbally or in a note , the first day  --  especially if the child has moved from another school . " But they also want the scoop on your child 's interests , such as a passion for animals or soccer , and any skill development over the summer ; it 's just that this can wait a few weeks until the teacher knows your child better . Prince sums it up by saying , " Anything you are worried about , tell the teacher right away . The things you 'd like to talk about because your child is important to you can wait until a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have that later conversation . " She gives a specific example . " I once had a child who was having trouble with school work , and it was n't until later in the year that we discovered she was very musical . Knowing that gave teachers a chance to have the child sing , and her confidence at school began to grow . If we 'd known earlier , we could have improved her feelings about school a lot sooner . " At King George Elementary , a French immersion school in Calgary , getting to know each child is a priority . The parents of every student entering the school for the first time fill out a " Parent Viewpoint " form , which asks about everything from siblings and cultural holidays or beliefs , to fears , behavioural concerns and favourite games . Teachers and parents of returning students fill out the form together each September . They discuss the past year 's school experience and talk about how the summer went . The teachers at King George prepare for this first parent-teacher meeting by making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher . " It 's important for parents and teachers to work together as a team , " says principal Lise Mayne . " For each child 's sake , the expectations and understandings need to be the same at home and at school . The child 's growth also needs to be discussed as she moves from teacher to teacher . " King George has also developed an enviable program to get to know a child and her parents . Each teacher has voice mail , so it 's easy for parents to leave specific messages , and translators are available for ESL students . If your child 's school is n't quite there yet , you may have to take the initiative yourself . " Teachers are usually available immediately after school , " advises Halifax 's Pat Smith , " but if that 's not convenient , do n't hesitate to call the school for an appointment or send a note in with your child . A one-on-one conversation is certainly best , especially in the beginning . " Smith sends a letter to parents in September encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and identifying the free time she has during gym or music classes or after school . Other teachers have agendas or zip-lock bags that go back and forth , or a mailbox on their desk for notes from parents . " The only time that 's not good for most teachers is morning entry time , " says Smith . " I see this as a special time for the children to tell me their stories . But I 'm at school early and I talk to parents before the kids arrive . " Bala 's Laurie Prince mentions one parent in her school who puts an envelope together for her two children 's new teachers , giving a brief introduction to each child and how they 're viewing school this year . She includes a friendly note asking teachers to give her a call when it 's convenient . " I really applaud this , " says Prince . " Summer can be a very anxious time for some children . It 's important that teachers know early how the child is feeling about the new year . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send a welcome note to children at home during the summer . " Kids need a safe environment in order to learn , " she says . " Part of feeling safe is knowing there are no surprises . As an adult , you may recognize that anxious feeling of not knowing whom your next boss is going to be . It 's the same for many kids . " Most teachers use the information you share not just to understand your child but to shape the curriculum for the whole class . " I like to know where a child shines in order to build her confidence and self-esteem at school , " says Smith . September may be the time of year teachers and parents need to communicate most , but keeping teachers informed of changes is important any time of the year . " It 's critical to communicate any trauma , illness or change in behaviour , " says King George 's Mayne . " Children ca n't express most emotions verbally , they ca n't talk about death or family tension easily , so it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child suddenly start bullying . It turned out there were family problems . If I 'd known , we could have talked to the child with understanding before the acting out began . " Communication is especially important if there are cultural differences to consider . Ghazala Qayyum was an elementary school teacher at the Maritime Muslim Academy in Halifax . Many of the students are new to Canada and are entering school at a variety of ages . Qayyum made a point of talking to parents early in the year to understand each family 's culture and language . Her own children attended the local public school where Qayyum would introduce herself to their teachers early on to explain what her children might have difficulty with in a Canadian school . " For the first two years of my daughter 's schooling in Halifax , she had trouble understanding why her female teachers were allowed to wear clothes that exposed their legs and arms , " remembers Qayyum . " She would worry about them and ask them questions . Because I had spoken to the teachers in advance about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentle and patient with her . " Pat Smith is particularly interested in weaving cultural information into the curriculum . " One year I had a class with students from many different backgrounds , so throughout the year I gave each student an opportunity to bring in a family " treasure " and tell the story behind the treasure , " she says . At the end of the year , the class had a tea and each child invited a family member and brought in the treasures again . " Some of the items were indeed genuine treasures , " says Smith . " One of the families was among the original " boat people " from Vietnam , and the child told the story of his escape . His family told me the child had never talked about it until then . I just cried . It was an extremely rewarding year for everyone . " AGE 6 ACTUAL FACTUALS Co-education ? Mais non ! French settlers like the Recollets and Jesuits established the first schools in Canada from 1615 to 1618 , and brought with them deepseated attitudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five , six and seven were thought to know more about " wickedness " than people of 30 or 40 from the previous generation . WHAT THE TEACHER SHOULD KNOW King George Elementary School in Calgary has a checklist of details they like to know when a child starts a new school year : - changes in medical concerns such as allergies or diagnosed conditions ; - new siblings ; - behavioural concerns at home ; behavioural changes as the school year draws near , such as bedwetting ; - new fears  --  of the dark or snakes  --  or fears that have been overcome during the summer ; - sports or games they like ; - new friends ; - a change in social skills ; - a change in discipline strategies at home ; - recent traumas such as a death in the family or family tension ; - a change in living arrangements between parents ; - development in reading or printing skills ; - moving house . AGE7 ACTUAL FACTUALS Lucky boys : The lads of wealthy families in Ancient Rome started school at age seven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek meaning play ; a more advanced school was called schola , from the Greek for leisure . ) Girls were primarily schooled at home  --  some taught by educated slaves . AGE8 ACTUAL FACTUALS Suds alert ! In September 2001 , school kids in Limburg , Belgium , were given the choice of tafelbier ( table beer ) to sip with their lunch , courtesy of a beer appreciation group . The lager was deemed better than soft drinks and fruit juice , which studies had shown increased the risk of obesity and cancer in children . Almost 80 percent of the kids preferred the taste of the beer to pop . Dare we say there 's a hiccup in this policy ? WHAT THE TEACHER DOES N'T NEED TO KNOW " Johnny had the shits . " That was a little too descriptive for the teacher who received this explanation from a parent for her son 's absence , but most teachers agree there 's almost no such thing as too much information about a child new to school . Except from children themselves . They like to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " bum ; Mom 's stopped taking her pills so a baby will come out ; and Daddy does n't wear jammies to bed . Stories such as these have led more than one teacher to post a sign on her desk that reads , " Parents , if you promise not to believe everything you hear about me , I promise not to believe everything I hear about you .
