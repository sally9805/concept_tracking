Only it was n't working . Hart and Villegas looked as if they were attempting to escape from straitjackets as tees dropped repeatedly on the tops of their feet . " I had to take out my video camera , " Bennett recalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The duo have been laughing a lot this season . Just two days before , pupil Will Mackenzie had won the Tour 's Reno-Tahoe Open . In August , Dean Wilson had won at the International , near Denver , and in April , Aaron Baddeley had taken home the trophy at the Verizon Heritage , in Hilton Head , S.C . Word of mouth spread so fast that Tim Herron took a sabbatical from his regular instructor in May and worked with Plummer for just 48 hours before winning at Colonial . // Bennett and Plummer may be the Tour 's teachers of the moment , but their method is rooted in a 35-year-old physics- and mathematics-laden tome , Homer Kelley 's The Golfing Machine . In the early-1980s Bobby Clampett was the book 's flag-bearer , but when his career went south , so did the book 's reputation . Mac O'Grady , the legendarily eccentric player and instructor , taught his version of the Machine 's methods through the ' 80s , but his odd , secret-society manner put people off . // In the early- to mid- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mini-tour players , worked with O'Grady . The lessons were influential . By the end of the decade both had dropped off the tours and turned to teaching . Though they held various jobs throughout the country , they remained connected because of their devotion to the Machine 's principles . And in 2002 they met again through Tom Scherrer , a struggling pro who hired both of them to help with his swing . Something about the tandem teaching assignment clicked , and they continued to work together , slowly building up a stable of Tour clients , including Wilson , Steve Elkington and Grant Waite . // The pair has just opened their own teaching facility in Radnor , Pa. , and the best advertisement for their services may be Wilson 's success . Through his 20s and early 30s Wilson , now 36 , bounced " from one top teacher to another , " he says , " but things kept getting worse . There was a time in the middle of 2004 when I did n't want to hit balls in front of people anymore . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 04 . Since then he 's risen 143 places in the World Ranking , to 67th , with winnings this year of $1.986 million . // Plenty of players , though , look askance at Bennett and Plummer 's teaching and its reliance on The Golfing Machine . With its talk of angles , tilts and multiple planes , the book reminds many players of an onerous high school class . But the two instructors insist that students grasp the theory 's principles . " Some guys simply want to fix the computer , " says Elkington . " Mike and Andy want to open up the computer and show you how it works . " // The resulting swing looks radically different from today 's dominant models . Most top teachers advocate a big move off the ball , loading up the right side to produce power and keeping the shoulders more or less level . Bennett and Plummer , in contrast , stress staying over the ball , with less weight shift and a steep shoulder turn . " At first it looks and feels like a reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely love the feeling of being right on top of the ball . " // Ultimately , an emphasis on consistent ball striking , rather than distance , is the key to their popularity . The power game " is fine for guys who hit it as far as Tiger , Phil and Vijay , " Wilson says , " but what about the rest of us ? We 're not going to beat anybody trying to play that way .
