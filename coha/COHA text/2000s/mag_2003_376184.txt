Ever since the Arab-Israeli war of 1973 , Israel has braced for attacks that come in the hours surrounding Yom Kippur , the holiest day of the Jewish year . Among the steps planned for this year was a ban on Palestinians entering Israel from the West Bank and Gaza Strip . But whatever sense of security Israelis may have felt was shattered on Saturday when a suicide bomber blew herself up in a crowded restaurant in Haifa , killing at least 19 people . The bomber  --  identified by the radical group Islamic Jihad as Hanadi Jaradat , from the West Bank city of Jenin  --  was believed to have acted in revenge for the killing of her brother and cousin by Israeli soldiers in June .

Several Israeli Cabinet ministers again urged Sharon to expel Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat from the West Bank . Arafat , for his part , condemned the suicide bombing . But Israel 's impatience with the continued violence has left Arafat 's fate , along with that of peace talks , hanging by an ever more precarious thread .  --  By Daren Fonda .
