. Chip Rizzotto saw the thundercloud over his head while waiting for his fishing partners . The next thing he remembered was waking up in agony . For four days last summer , Chip Rizzotto was in a cloud . Vaguely , he remembers someone cutting off his clothing and a voice saying , " We do n't have any on board . But when we get there , you 'd better have some morphine ready . " Later , during a checkup with one of his several doctors , a nurse seemed surprised . " Do n't you remember me , Chip ? I was in the emergency room when they brought you in . I 've never seen a man in so much pain . " No , he does n't recall the nurse , nor several days spent in the ICU , nor telling his wife , repeatedly , " Francine , my arms are on fire ! " In fact , Rizzotto does n't remember anything at all about the bolt of lightning that struck him on the top of his head on August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light cloud cover  --  perfect for dry-fly fishing , the since-retired 69-year-old outfitter told his clients , who had just finished breakfast at the guesthouse of his High Country Outfitter Lodge . Just to the west , the Yellowstone River splits the Gallatin and Absaroka Ranges at the floor of Montana 's Paradise Valley . After a morning 's fishing on the West Branch of Mill Creek , Rizzotto parked his truck a quarter mile from the main branch of this Yellowstone tributary , and he and his anglers , Jeff Himes of Gulliver , Mich. , and Gary Liubakka of Hibbing , Minn. , walked to the stream . Above the water , size 12 gray drakes rose brightly , lit by long arms of sunlight reaching down into the steep side canyon . Others sailing downstream disappeared in slurping rise forms that kept the men 's attention until about 5 P.M. , when Himes landed a 21-inch cutthroat , and Rizzotto , taking hero pictures , heard a muffled clap of thunder . " Maybe we should have left right then , " Rizzotto admits , although that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribbon of sky visible above him was clear blue . Shortly , though , a dark cloud broke over the rim of the canyon . Rizzotto called it quits . " I asked the guys to break down their rods , hold them below their hips , and follow me back to the truck . " Leaving the water , the men walked parallel to Mill Creek along a treeless cobblestone-and-gravel flood-plain studded with short willows and grasses . At 5 feet 10 inches , Rizzotto was the tallest of the group . " It started to rain pretty good then , and the cell was almost directly above us , dense and nearly black . I looked over my shoulder and saw that the guys were 20 or 30 feet behind me , so I stopped to let them catch up . " And that 's when it happened . " I saw the plasma arc  --  an incredibly bright column of white light about 18 inches in diameter , " says Liubakka , who still has a vivid mental image of the bolt leveling his outfitter . " From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hugging it . Then he went straight down . " The bolt struck Rizzotto directly on the head , at the hairline just above the left eye , searing a fist-size hole through his baseball cap . It surged down the left side of his face , across his upper chest , and down his right hip and leg . Along its path , it burned through his clothes like a blowtorch , opening a blackened , ragged seam from his shirt collar to his pant cuff . Finally , it exited Rizzotto 's right ankle , coursed across the wet ground in what is called a " side splash , " and knocked Himes and Liubakka off their feet . " All at once , I felt as if every muscle in my body was being torn from every bone , " Liubakka says . " I was launched into the air and saw Jeff , also airborne , horizontal , and bent horribly backward . " Liubakka was the only man left conscious for the moment . " I tried to get up but my body would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Chip . When there was no answer , I thought they were both dead . " Himes soon came to , though , and found that like Liubakka , he was temporarily paralyzed from the waist down . The two men dragged themselves to where Rizzotto was lying facedown in the cobblestones , unmoving , as the rain fell harder . " When we turned him over , smoke poured off his torso , " Liubakka recalls . All the stitching in his hat was gone and the hair on his chest was singed . The men were relieved when the outfitter gasped for air . They sat him up . " Wait a minute , boys , " Rizzotto mumbled . " I 'll be okay . " Both anglers knew otherwise . Liubakka , who was recovering faster , pulled himself to his feet with a stick and hiked to the road for help . Himes stayed and wrapped Rizzotto in his fishing vest against the cooling rain . Gradually , the feeling came back to the outfitter 's charred arms and he began groaning , then screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 911 on a cellphone . In 20 minutes , two ambulances arrived and EMTs carried Rizzotto out on a backboard . Four days passed before Rizzotto 's next clear memory , of holding his wife 's hand in the ICU , asking her if he 'd been in a car accident . His short-term recall remains porous today , due to what his neurologist describes as " his brain being fried . " In January , Rizzotto had an operation to remove a cataract caused by the strike , which had evaporated the fluid in his right eye . For months , other than a metallic tang in his mouth , he had no sense of taste or smell , and " neither has returned more than 15 percent , " he says . The constant tinnitus in his ears is off the charts . His legs are numb from his kneecaps to the tips of his toes . And he has constant pain , even with medication , from his shoulders to his palms . Nonetheless , Rizzotto insists , " I am absolutely a lucky man "  --  lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to not be bedridden or a burden to his wife . But there 's something else . Next to family and friends , Rizzotto calls flyfishing the most important thing in his life . " Several weeks afterward , " he says , " I got out a rod , not knowing what to expect , and made long , tight loops . " Since his accident , he has been to the Florida Keys and the Bahamas four times for bonefish and permit . " I was determined to stay in the game , " he says . That is , to a point . On the morning of our interview , after catching a 24-inch rainbow on a streamer fly a short distance from where he was struck last summer , the lightning survivor saw a dark cloud moving toward him down Paradise Valley .

McClellanville , South Carolina <p> For three generations , the pull of the tides drew Morrison men to the sea . Attuned to the moon , they rose before first light to board wooden shrimp boats and head slowly out across black water , the heavy green nets poised like folded wings . Tales of the sea were whispered to them in their mothers ' laps , they earned their sea legs as they learned to walk , and they labored on the boats soon after . Shrimping was all they knew or ever wanted to know . It was in their blood . <p> Bud Morrison opened his eyes and pushed back the thin cotton blanket . Shafts of gray light through the shutters cast a ragged pattern against the wall . He groaned and shifted his weight in an awkward swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent , feet on the floor . His was a seaman 's body  --  hard-weathered and scarred . He scratched his jaw , his head , his belly , a morning ritual , waking slowly in the leaden light . Then , with another sigh , he stiffly rose . His knees creaked louder than the bedsprings , and he winced at aches and pains so old he 'd made peace with them . Standing , he could turn his bad knee to let it slip back into place with a small pop . <p> A salty wind whistled through the open window , fluttering the pale curtains . Bud walked across the wood floor to peer out at the sky . He scowled when he saw shadowy , fingerlike clouds clutching the moon in a hazy grip . <p> " Wind 's blowin ' . " <p> Bud turned toward the voice . Carolina lay on her belly on their bed , her head to the side facing an open palm . Her eyes were still closed . <p> " Not too bad , " he replied in a gravelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swipe a lock of hair from her face . " I 'll make your breakfast . " She raised herself on her elbows , her voice resigned . <p> " Nah , you sleep . " <p> His stomach rumbled , and he wondered if he was some kind of fool for not nudging his wife to get up and make him his usual breakfast of pork sausage and biscuits . Lord knew his father never gave his mother a day off from work . Or his kids , for that matter . Not during shrimping season . But he was not his father , and Carolina had a bad tooth that had kept her tossing and turning half the night . She did n't want to spend money they did n't have to see the dentist , but the pain was making her hell on wheels to live with , and in the end , she 'd have to go anyway . <p> He 'd urged her to go but she 'd refused . It infuriated Bud that she would n't , because it pointed to his inability to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside , a feeling only another man would understand . <p> They 'd had words about it the night before . He shook his head and let the curtain drop . Man , that woman could be stubborn . No , he thought , he 'd rather have a little peace than prickly words this morning . <p> " I 'm only going out for one haul , " he told her . " Back by noon , latest . " <p> " Be careful out there , " she replied with a muffled yawn as she buried her face back into the pillows . <p> He stole a moment to stare at the ample curves of her body under the crumpled sheet . There was a time he 'd crawl back into the scented warmth of the bed he 'd shared with Carolina for more than thirty years . Even after all that time , there was something about the turn of her chin , the roundness of her shoulders , and the earthy , fulsome quality of her beauty that still caused his body to stir . Carolina 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the darkness he could n't see the slender streaks of gray that he knew distressed her . Carolina was not one for hair color or makeup , and Bud liked her natural , so the gray stayed . Lord knew his own hair was turning gray , he thought , running his hand over his scalp as he headed for the bathroom . <p> Bud took pride in being a clean man . His hands might be scraped , his fingernails broken and discolored , but they were scrubbed . Nothing fancy or scented . He tugged the gold band from his ring finger , then slipped it on a gold chain and fastened it around his neck . He did n't wear his ring on his hand on the boat , afraid it would get caught in the machinery . The cotton pants and shirt he slipped on were scrupulously laundered , but no matter what Carolina tried , she could n't get rid of the stains . Or the stink of fish . This was the life they 'd chosen . <p> As he brushed his teeth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older than his fifty-seven years . A lifetime of salt and sea had navigated a deep course across his weathered face . Long lines from the eyes down to his jaw told tales of hard hours under a brutal sun . A quick smile brightened his eyes like sunshine on blue water . Carolina always told him she loved the sweet smell of shrimp on his body . It had taken her years to get used to it , but in time she 'd said it made her feel safe . He spat out the toothpaste and wiped his smile with the towel . What a woman his Carolina was . God help him , he still loved her , he thought , tossing the towel in the hamper and cutting off the light . <p> Carolina 's face was dusky in the moonlight . He walked to the bedside and bent to kiss her cheek good-bye , then paused , held in check by the stirring of an old resentment . The distance to her cheek felt too far . Sighing , he drew back . Instead , he lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed the door . <p> He rubbed his aching knee as he made his way down the ancient stairs . The old house was dark , but he did n't need a light to navigate his way through the narrow halls . White Gables had been in Carolina 's family since 1897 in a town founded by her ancestors . When they were n't working on the boat , they were working to infuse new life into the aged frame house , repairing costly old woodwork and heart pine floors , fighting an interminable battle against salt , moisture , and termites . His father often chided him about it , telling him it was like throwing more sand on a beach eaten away by a strong current . In his heart , Bud knew the old man was right , but Carolina loved the house and the subject of leaving it was moot . Even in the dim light , he saw evidence of it in the shine of the brass doorknobs , the sparkle of the windows , and the neat arrangement of the inherited threadbare sofa and chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , he was haunted by the worry that he 'd cause Carolina to be the last of her family to live here . <p> Bud went straight to the kitchen and opened the fridge . He leaned against the cool metal , staring in , searching for whatever might spark his appetite . With a sigh he grabbed a six-pack and shut the door . The breakfast of champions , he thought as he popped open a can of beer . The cool brew slaked his thirst , waking him further . Then he grabbed a few ingredients from the pantry and tossed them in a brown bag : onions , garlic , potatoes , grits , coffee . Pee Dee would cook up a seaman 's breakfast later , after the haul . He added the rest of the beer . <p> At the door he stuck his feet into a pair of white rubber boots , stuffing his pants tightly inside the high rims . The Red Ball boots with their deep-grooved soles and high tops were uniform for shrimpers . They did the job of keeping him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creeping in . He rose stiffly , rubbing the small of his back . Working on the water took its toll on a man 's body with all the falls , twists , and heavy lifting . <p> " Stop complaining , old woman , " he scolded himself . " The sun wo n't wait . " He scooped up the brown bag from the table , flipped a cap onto his head , and headed out of the house . <p> The moon was a sliver in the dark sky and his heels crunched loudly along the gravel walkway . Several ancient oaks , older than the house , lined their property along Pinckney Street . Their low-hanging branches lent a note of melancholy . <p> The air was soft this early in the morning . Cooler . The rise and fall of insects singing in the thick summer foliage sounded like a jungle chorus . He got in his car and drove a few blocks along narrow streets . McClellanville was a small , quaint village along the coast of South Carolina between Charleston and Myrtle Beach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina to Florida , back when shrimping was king and a man could make a good living for his family . In his own lifetime , Bud had seen shrimping villages disappear as the value of coastal land skyrocketed and the cost of local shrimp plummeted . Docks were sold and the weathered shrimp boats were replaced by glossy pleasure boats . Local families who 'd fished these waters for generations moved on . Bud wondered how much longer McClellanville could hold on . <p> His headlights carved a swath through the inky darkness , revealing the few cars and pickup trucks of captains and crews parked in the lot . He did n't see Pee Dee 's dilapidated Ford . Bud sighed and checked the clock on his dashboard . It was 4:30 a.m . Where the hell was that sorry excuse for a deckhand ? <p> He followed the sound of water slapping against the shore and the pungent smell of diesel fuel , salt , and rotting fish toward the dock . Drawing close , he breathed deep and felt the stirring of his fisherman 's blood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in his sweet-smelling house on Pinckney Street . Gone were the tourists , the folks coming to buy local shrimp , and the old sailors who hung around retelling stories . In the wee hours of morning , the docks were quiet save for the fishermen working with fevered intensity against the dawn . Lights on the trawlers shone down on the rigging , colored flags , and bright trim , lending the docks an eerie carnival appearance . <p> His heels reverberated on the long avenue of rotting wood and tilting pilings that ran over mudflats spiked with countless oysters . Bud passed two trawlers  --  the Village Lady and the Miss Georgia , their engines already churning the water . He quickened his step . The early bird catches the worm , he thought , lifting his hand in a wave . Buster Gay , a venerable captain and an old mate , returned the wave with his free hand , eyes intent on his work . <p> There were fewer boats docked every year , dwindling from fifteen to seven in as many years . Of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel prices and the dumping of foreign shrimp on the market made it hardly worth taking out the boat anymore . Captains were selling their boats . <p> Bud continued down the dock , sidestepping bales of rope , holes in the planks , and hard white droppings from gulls . As he passed , he took note of one boat 's chipping paint , another 's thick layer of rust . Every boat had a distinctive look . Each had a story . <p> " Hey , Bud , " called out LeRoy Simmons as he passed . " Looks like rain coming . " <p> " Yep , " Bud replied , looking up to the deck of the big sixty-five-foot Queen Betty , where LeRoy was hunched over his nets . " Wind , too . " <p> LeRoy grunted in agreement . " We ought a get a day 's work in . " <p> " A half day , at least . " <p> " At least . I 'm hopin ' the rain flushes the shrimp down . " <p> Bud waved and walked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had known LeRoy all his life . LeRoy was second generation of a McClellanville family of African American shrimpers . Captain Simmons could bring in more shrimp on a blustery day than most other boats on a good day . Bud knew it took a lot more than luck . <p> Time was , a captain with the reputation of bringing home the shrimp had his pick of top crew because the strikers got a percentage of the day 's catch instead of salary . Now the catch was unpredictable , if not downright pitiful . Too often , the crew got little money and drifted off to higher-paying jobs on land . It was damn near impossible for a captain to hire on decent crew . <p> In this , LeRoy was more than lucky , too . Bud glanced back at the Queen Betty to see LeRoy and his two brothers nimbly moving their fingers over the nets , searching for tears . The Simmons brothers worked together like a well-oiled machine . He grimaced , remembering the days when he and his brother had worked together . Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nets and the work that needed to be done before he could shove off . Where the hell was Pee Dee ? <p> Peter Deery had been born to a dirt-poor farming family on the Pee Dee River , and the nickname stuck . For all the damage booze and drugs had done to his brain , Pee Dee was clean and sober on deck and as nimble as a monkey on the rigging . And he worked harder than two men . He was Bud 's cousin once removed . Sometimes Bud wished he were more removed . A man could n't pick his family , but a captain could pick his crew  --  and Pee Dee was somewhere in the middle . <p> Bud 's frown lifted when , through the mist and dim light , he spied the Miss Carolina waiting for him at the end of the dock . His chest expanded . <p> The Miss Carolina was a graceful craft , sleek and strong like the woman she was named for . He 'd built the fiberglass and wood trawler with his own hands and knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent more time with this boat than with any woman alive , and his wife often complained that the Miss Carolina was more his mistress than his boat . He 'd shake his head and laugh , inclined to agree . <p> Every spring he gave the Miss Carolina a fresh coat of glistening white paint and the berry-red trim that marked all the Morrison boats . Yes , she was a mighty pretty boat . His eyes softened just looking at her . All captains had their families and loved them dearly . Yet there was a special love reserved for their boats . <p> The morning 's quiet was shattered by the roar of an engine coming alive . Bud swung his head around to see the Queen Betty drawing away from the dock and making her way out to sea , her green and white mast lights flashing in the dark . Ol ' LeRoy would have his nets dropped by sunup , he thought with a scowl . Damn , he 'd get the best spot , too . <p> Fifteen minutes later , the Miss Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mug of hot coffee in his hand . He sat in the pilothouse , breathing in the scent of diesel fuel mingled with coffee , and listened to the marine radio for weather reports . The boat rocked beneath him , warming up and churning the water like a boiling pot . After finishing his coffee , he began his chores . There was always one more job that needed doing , one last repair he had to see to before he could break away from the dock . He needed to get ice in , fuel up , and get some rope .... Bud sighed and shook his head . He could n't wait for Pee Dee to show up . He might as well get rolling . Bud climbed down from the boat to the dock . <p> A weathered warehouse with a green-and-red-painted sign that read COASTAL SEAFOOD dominated the waterfront . The warehouse was the heart of the dock where fishermen could get fuel , ice , and gear , then unload shrimp at the end of the day . Under its rusted awning a few men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking coffee from Styrofoam cups , and bantering while waiting to load ice . They grunted greetings as Bud moved past them . Inside , the big room was sparsely filled with a few metal chairs and tables and a rough plywood counter . <p> A young , broad-shouldered man with unruly dark hair leaned against the counter . He wore a denim jacket against the morning chill and white rubber boots high over his worn and stained jeans . He looked both boyish and edgy , with the congenial air of a man who is well liked . He turned when Bud approached and broke into a lazy grin . <p> " Hey , Bud , " he called out . <p> " Hey , Josh , " he replied , hearing the resignation in his own voice . He had n't expected to see Josh Truesdale this morning . <p> " I was hoping I 'd run into you , " Josh said , straightening . <p> " Yeah ? " Bud replied , stepping up beside him at the counter . Josh met Bud eye to eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Josh shook his head with a wry grin . " Do n't look so worried , Cap'n . I ai n't gon na launch into Lizzy now . " <p> Bud barely suppressed his grin  --  the kid had hit the nail on the head . His daughter was exactly the subject he was hoping to avoid . " You know I do n't have nothin ' more to say to you on that subject . You and Lizzy  --  that 's your problem . Not mine . " <p> " I hear you , " he replied . " But I got this other problem I was hoping you 'd take a look at . My winch . Not my wench . " He chuckled at his joke . <p> Bud 's eyes flashed in warning . He did n't care for jokes about his daughter . <p> Josh 's smile fell hard . " Sorry , " he blurted . " You know I did n't mean no disrespect . " <p> Bud liked Joshua Truesdale , always had . There were n't many young men going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew on one hand . Most of the captains in these parts were too old and too stubborn to change their ways . Josh was one of a new breed of shrimpers . Though he came from an old line of fishermen in the Shem Creek area , Josh had ideas on how he could make the business pay . While Bud liked his enthusiasm , sometimes those new ideas made the kid a bit cocky . Still , Josh Truesdale was the best deckhand he 'd ever had . <p> Even if he was the worst son-in-law . <p> " Well , " Bud drawled , lifting his hand to signal to Tom Wiggins behind the counter , " I sure do n't got the time to help you now . " <p> Tom was a small , wiry man who looked to Bud like a gray squirrel , with his gray stained clothes , a wreath of gray , frizzy curls , and a beard that was as bushy as a squirrel 's tail . Ol ' Tom had worked this counter for as long as Bud could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd looked the same when Bud was a kid as he did now . <p> " Tommy , you got a couple hundred feet of three-quarter-inch rope back there ? " <p> " Yeah , hold on and I 'll get you some . " <p> " What 's the matter with your winch ? " Bud asked , turning again to Josh . <p> " Keeps slipping . Has no tension . " <p> " And what can I do ? " <p> " I remembered how you jerry-rigged your winch . " <p> Bud rubbed his jaw . Adjustments on equipment were common enough among captains . Especially among those who 'd built their own boats to their own specifications , as he had . Bud did n't always have the money to buy a new part , or maybe he did n't even know what part could do the job he had in mind , so it called on him to be inventive . Most every boat had been rigged by its captain one way or another . It was a point of pride and gave a boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that old winch , " he replied . " But I do n't rightly know that I can recall what I did to it . " <p> " Come on , Bud . Everyone knows you 're the best damn mechanic in these parts . " <p> " That 's for true , " added Tom . <p> Bud scratched behind his ear with a self-conscious smile , not immune to flattery . <p> " Will this do ? " asked Tom , handing over the rope . <p> Bud made a cursory inspection . " Yeah , it 'll do . Put it on my tab . " <p> Tom blanched and rubbed his neck . " Sorry , Bud . Ca n't do that . Everything 's on a cash basis now . " <p> Bud 's head jerked up . " Since when ? " <p> " Since nobody can pay their bills and they 're falling behind . I do n't mean you , " he stammered . " But , hell , Bud , you know how the times are . I got no choice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word I got direct from Lee , and I got to do it . Or I 'd make one for you . You know that . " <p> Bud 's ears colored and he tightened his lips as a surge of anger shot through him . Lee Edwards had once been like a brother to him , but he 'd proved to be more Cain than Abel , and there 'd been bad blood ever since . It still burned that Lee had done so well over the years . He owned Coastal Seafood and just about all the preferred real estate along the docks . Bud hated to admit it , but Lee was a good businessman . If the shrimp boats failed , Lee would still be sitting pretty . <p> Bud silently cursed . His haul was hardly worth a day 's wage , and that was before taxes . Hell , Lee and his pals probably spent more on lunch than Bud earned in a day . Running a tab at the fish house was how most fishermen made it through a rough patch . Most every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gnawed at Bud that he was one of them . <p> " Well , shit , Tom , " he said , struggling to keep his anger in check . " I did n't plan on buying rope this morning and I do n't have enough cash on me . " <p> " Here , let me , " Josh said , pulling a worn black leather wallet from his back pocket . <p> " No way , " Bud said gruffly . " I do n't need your money . I can pay my own bills . " <p> " I ai n't saying you ca n't . I 'm just lending it to you . No big deal . Besides , I owe you . " <p> " You do n't owe me nothing , son . " <p> " I think you know I do . " Josh 's emotion was too strong and he cleared his throat . " You can take it as a down payment for working on my winch . " <p> Bud struggled with a reply . He 'd never take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rope now . <p> " I reckon I could come by and take a look at that winch later today or tomorrow , weather depending . " <p> " Yes , sir . Anytime . " <p> Bud nodded , grateful for Josh 's respectful tone . And the kid had a winning smile . It must 've been the dark tan that made his teeth shine so white . He was n't blind to the fact that his daughter still thought so , too . <p> Josh laid out bills on the plywood counter . <p> Tom gingerly handed the rope into Bud 's hands , relieved to have the transaction settled amicably . " Sorry about that . Nothin ' personal . " <p> " Yeah , sure , " Bud murmured . " You tell Lee Edwards he can stick his policy where the sun do n't shine . Nothin ' personal . " Bud hoisted the rope and turned to leave . <p> " Where 's your boy ? " Josh asked , tucking his wallet back into his pocket . " Do n't you usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai n't seen him , " Bud replied , walking out . <p> " He 's probably on some bender again , " Josh remarked . " What a loser . " <p> Bud turned fast and walked back toward Josh . No matter what Bud might think or say about his own , he would n't allow anyone else to slander them , not even Josh . <p> Josh took a step back as Bud leaned close . In a low voice , he said , " Pee Dee and the Miss Carolina are n't your concern anymore . Nor , for that matter , is my daughter . Got that ? " <p> Josh straightened his spine and locked eyes with Bud . " Lizzy is my concern . But I 'm sorry for what I said about Pee Dee . " <p> Bud considered Josh 's words , impressed by his unflinching gaze . He remembered the boy , but this depth of feeling reflected a man . Maybe the kid grew up some in the five years since Lizzy dumped him . Bud acknowledged Josh 's apology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll come by your boat later . " <p> He adjusted the rope , then walked out , but not before he heard Tom mutter to Josh , " Boy , ai n't you learned your lesson yet ? " <p> By force of will , Bud shoved the roiling thoughts about Pee Dee , Lizzy , and Josh into a far corner of his mind to deal with later when the nets were dragging and he had time on his hands . Thinking about all that was like dredging the mud . Right now he had to clear his head and focus . Without Pee Dee here , it 'd take twice as long . He still had to load the ice and more work to get done than time to do it . <p> Bud put his back to it . As each minute passed , with each chore he ticked off his list , Bud 's anger was stoked till it fired a burn in his belly . He knew in his heart that Josh was right and that Pee Dee was likely on some bender . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no-show . <p> A short while later , the roar of engines sounded and he jerked up to look out over the bow . The final two boats slowly cruised along the narrow creek toward the Atlantic . Josh 's small but sturdy forty-five-footer , the Hope , followed in the bigger boat 's wake . Clever boy , he thought with grudging respect . With his smaller boat and his ideas for niche markets , he might do all right . <p> Bud cleared his throat and spat into the ocean . But there was a lot of life left in this salty old dog , he thought , rolling his shoulders . He 'd match his experience against some young Turk any day . Bud pressed the small of his back while his brows gathered . At times the pain was so severe it felt like a hot iron was being jammed into his lower lumbar . <p> Time was wasting . It was already late . Bud crossed his arms while he mulled over the pros and cons of the decision that faced him . The dawn was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any longer . Could he go it alone ? <p> It 'd be tough to take a boat this size out alone . But he 'd done it before , had n't he ? Bud cast a wary glance at the drifting clouds . He was n't fooled by the seeming serenity . His experienced eye knew they were the tips of a rain front likely to hit sometime later that afternoon . At least , he hoped the rain would hold off till then . God knew , he desperately needed a good haul today , and it would be easier to get in and unload before the first drops fell . <p> No doubt about it . It would be a risk out there alone if the wind picked up . But he 'd only be out for one haul . He 'd be back in dock before things got rough . <p> Bud brought his arms tight around his chest and narrowed his eyes . To his mind , a man worked hard to take care of his family . He did whatever he could , whatever toll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the captain of this vessel , and it was his duty to bring home the shrimp . He leaned forward , gripping the railing tight , and stared out at the dock . He only needed to bring in one good haul to pay the diesel fuel bill . One good haul , he repeated to himself , and he could keep his boat on the water . <p> What choice did he have ? Failure would mean the loss of everything he 'd worked so hard for . <p> Bud tugged down the rim of his cap , his decision made . <p> " Well , all right then .
