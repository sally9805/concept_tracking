Hemlock Bay , Chapter One Near the Plum River , Maryland It was a chilly day in late October . A stiff wind whipped the last colorful leaves off the trees . The sun was shining down hard and bright on the dilapidated red barn that had n't been painted in forty years . Streaks of washed-out red were all that was left of the last paint job . There was no charm left , at all . FBI Special Agent Dillon Savich eased around the side of the barn , his SIG Sauer in his right hand . It had taken discipline and practice , but he 'd learned to move so quietly that he could sneak up on a mouse . Three agents , one of them his wife , were some twenty feet behind him , covering him , ready to fan out in any direction necessary , all of them wearing Kevlar vests . A dozen more agents were slowly working their way up the other side of the barn , their orders to wait for a signal from Savich . Sheriff Dade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand of maple trees just thirty feet behind them . One of the deputies , a sharpshooter , had his sights trained on the barn . So far the operation was going smoothly , which , Savich supposed , surprised everyone , although no one spoke of it . He just hoped it would continue the way it had been planned , but chances were things would get screwed up . He 'd deal with it ; there was no choice . The barn was bigger than Savich liked-there was a big hayloft , and too many shadowy corners for this sort of operation . Too many nooks and crannies for an ambush , just plain too many places from which to fire a storm of bullets . A perfect place for Tommy and Timmy Tuttle , dubbed " the Warlocks " by the media , to hole up . They 'd hopscotched across the country , but had dropped out of sight here , in Maryland , with their two latest young teenage boys taken right out of the gym where they 'd been playing basketball after school , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Maryland was their destination , no sound reason really , but in his gut he just felt it . The profilers had n't said much about that , just that Maryland was , after all , on the Atlantic coast , so they really could n't go much farther east . Then MAX , Savich 's laptop , had dived into land registry files in Maryland and found that Marilyn Warluski , a first cousin to the Tuttle brothers , and who , MAX had also discovered , had had a baby at the age of seventeen fathered by Tommy Tuttle , just happened to own a narrow strip of land near a good-sized maple forest that was n't far from the serpentine Plum River . And on that sliver of property was a barn , a big ancient barn that had been abandoned for years . Savich had nearly clicked his heels together in excitement . And now , four hours later , here they were . There 'd been no sign of a car , but Savich was n't worried . The old Honda was probably stashed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The birds had gone still . The silence was heavy , oppressive , as if even the animals were expecting something to happen and knew instinctively that it would n't be good . Savich was afraid the Tuttle brothers were long gone . All they would find , despite the silence , would be their victims : teenage boys-Donny and Rob Arthur-dead , horribly mutilated , their bodies circumscribed by a large , black circle . Savich did n't want to smell any more blood . He did n't want to see any more death . Not today . Not ever . He looked down at his Mickey Mouse watch . It was time to see if the bad guys were in the barn . It was time to go into harm 's way . It was time to get the show on the road . MAX had found a crude interior plan of the barn , drawn some fifty years before , documented in a computerized county record as having been physically saved and filed . Kept where ? was the question . They 'd finally turned up the drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county planning building . But the drawing was clear enough . There was a small , narrow entry , down low , here on the west side . He found it behind a straggly naked bush . It was cracked open , wide enough for him to squeeze through . He looked back , waved his SIG Sauer at the three agents peering around the corner of the barn , a signal to hold their positions , and went in on his belly . He pushed the narrow door open an inch at a time . Filth everywhere , some rat carcasses strewn around . He nudged his way in on his elbows , feeling bones crunch beneath him , his SIG Sauer steady in his hand . There was a strange half-light in the barn . Dust motes filled the narrow spears of light coming through the upper windows , only shards of glass sticking up in some of the frames . He lay there quietly a moment , his eyes adjusting . He saw bales of hay so old they looked petrified , stacked haphazardly , rusted machinery-mainly odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the far corner was another door not more than twenty feet to the right of the front double barn doors . A tack room , he thought , and it had n't been shown on the drawing . Then he made out the outline of the Honda , tucked in the shadows at the far end of the barn . The two brothers were in the tack room , no doubt about it . And Donny and Rob Arthur ? Please , God , let them still be alive . He had to know exactly who was where before he called in the other agents . It was still , very still . He got to his feet and ran hunched over toward the tack room door , his gun fanning continuously , his breathing low and steady , his steps silent . He pressed his ear against the rotted wooden door of the tack room . He heard a male voice , clear and strong , and angry , suddenly louder . " Listen , you Little Bloods , it 's time for you to get in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they told me to hurry it up . They want to carve you up with their axes and knives-they really like to do that-but this time they want to tuck you away in their carryalls and fly away with you . Hey , maybe you 'll end up in Tahiti . Who knows ? They have n't wanted to do this before . But it does n't make any difference to us . Here come the Ghouls ! " And he laughed , a young man 's laugh , not all that deep , and it sounded quite happily mad . It made Savich 's blood run icy . Then another man 's voice , this one deeper . " Yep , almost ready for the Ghouls . We do n't want to disappoint them now , do we ? Move it , Little Bloods . " He heard them coming toward the door , heard the scuffling of feet , heard the boys ' crying , probably beyond reason now , heard curses and prods from the Tuttle brothers . It was then that he saw the huge , crude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the rotting wooden barn floor . Zero hour . No time , simply no time now to bring the others in . Savich barely made it down behind a rotted hay bale before one of them opened the tack room door and shoved a slight , pale boy in front of him . The boy 's filthy pants were nearly falling off his butt . It was Donny Arthur . He 'd been beaten , probably starved as well . He was terrified . Then a second terrified youth was shoved out of the small tack room next to him . Rob Arthur , only fourteen years old . Savich had never seen such fear on two such young faces in his life . If Savich ordered the Tuttles to stop now , they could use the boys for shields . No , better to wait . What was all that crazy talk about ghouls ? He watched the two men shove the boys forward until they actually kicked them into the center of the circle . " Do n't either of you move or I 'll take my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , pin you good . Tammy here will do the other with her knife . You got that , Little Bloods ? " Tammy ? Her knife ? No , it was two brothers-Tommy and Timmy Tuttle , more than enough alliteration , even for the media . No , he could n't have heard right . He was looking at two young men , both in black , long and lean , big , chunky black boots laced up the front to the knees like combat boots . They carried knives and guns . The boys were huddled together on their knees , crying , clutching each other . Blood caked their faces , but they could move , and that meant no bones were broken . " Where are the Ghouls ? " Tammy Tuttle shouted , and Savich realized in that instant that he had n't misheard ; it was n't the Tuttle brothers , it was one brother and one sister . What was all this about the ghouls coming to murder the boys ? " Ghouls , " Tammy yelled , her head thrown back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where are you ? We 've got your two treats for you , just what you like-two really sweet boys ! Little Bloods , both of them . Bring your knives and axes ! Come here , Ghouls . " It was a chant , growing louder as she repeated herself once , twice , then three times . Each time , her voice was louder , more vicious , the words ridiculous , really , except for the underlying terror they carried . Tammy Tuttle kicked one of the boys , hard , when he tried to crawl out of the circle . Savich knew he had to act soon . Where were these ghouls ? He heard something , something that was different from the mad human voices , like a high whine , sort of a hissing sound that did n't belong here , maybe did n't belong anywhere . He felt gooseflesh rise on his arms . He felt a shock of cold . He was on the point of leaping out when , to his utter astonishment , the huge front barn doors whooshed inward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that light were dust devils that looked like small tornadoes . The white light faded away , and the dust devils looked more like two whirling , white cones , distinct from each other , spinning and twisting , riding up then dipping down , blending together , then separating-no , no , they were just dust devils , still white because they had n't sucked up the dirt yet from the barn floor . But what was that sound he heard ? Something strange , something he could n't identify . Laughter ? No , that was crazy , but that was what registered in his brain . The boys saw the dust devils , whirling and spinning far above them , and started screaming . Rob jumped up , grabbed his older brother , and managed to jerk him out of the circle . Tammy Tuttle , who 'd been looking up , turned suddenly , raised her knife , and yelled , " Get back down , Little Bloods ! Do n't you dare anger the Ghouls . Get back in the circle , now ! GET BACK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle . Tommy Tuttle was on them in an instant , jerking them back . Tammy Tuttle drew the knife back , aiming toward Donny Arthur , as Savich leaped up from behind the bale of hay and fired . The bullet ripped into her arm at her shoulder . She screamed and fell onto her side , the knife flying out of her hand . Tommy Tuttle whipped about , no knife in his hand now but a gun , and that gun was aimed not at Savich but at the boys . The boys were screaming as Savich shot Tommy through the center of his forehead . Tammy Tuttle was moaning on the floor , holding her arm . The boys stood , clutched together , silent now , and all three of them looked up toward those whirling , white cones that danced up and down in the clear light coming through the barn doors . No , not dust devils , two separate things . One of the boys whispered , " What are they ? " " I do n't know , Rob , " Savich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as best he could . " Just some sort of weird tornado , that 's all . " Tammy was yelling curses at Savich as she tried to pull herself up . She fell back . There was a shriek , loud and hollow . One of the cones seemed to leap forward , directly at them . Savich did n't think , just shot it , clean through . It was like shooting through fog . The cone danced upward , then twisted back toward the other cone . They hovered an instant , spinning madly , and in the next instant , they were gone . Simply gone . Savich grabbed both boys against him again . " It 's all right now , Donny , Rob . You 're both all right . I 'm very proud of you , and your parents will be , too . Yes , it 's okay to be afraid ; I know I 'm scared out of my mind , too . Just stay nice and safe against me . That 's it . You 're safe now . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel their hearts pounding as they sobbed , deep , ragged sobs , and he knew there was blessed relief in their sobs , that they finally believed they were going to survive . They clutched at him and he held them as tightly as he could , whispering , " It will be all right . You 're going to be home in no time at all . It 's okay , Rob , Donny . " He kept them both shielded from Tammy Tuttle , who was no longer moaning . He made no move to see what shape she was in . " The Ghouls , " one of the boys kept saying over and over , his young voice cracking . " They told us all about what the Ghouls did to all the other boys-ate them up whole or if they were already full , then they just tore them up , chewed on their bones- " " I know , I know , " Savich said , but he had no idea what his eyes had seen , not really . Whirling dust devils , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knives . Unless they somehow morphed into something more substantial ? No , that was crazy . He felt something catch inside him . It was a sense of what was real , what had to be real . It demanded he reject what he 'd seen , bury it under a hundred tons of earth , make the Ghouls gone forever , make it so they had never existed . It must have been some kind of natural phenomenon , easily explained , or some kind of an illusion , a waking nightmare , a mad invention of a pair of psychopaths ' minds . But whatever they were that the Tuttles had called the Ghouls , he 'd seen them , even shot at one of them , and they were embedded in his brain . Maybe they had been dust devils , playing tricks on his eyes . Maybe . As he stood holding the two thin bodies to him , talking to them , he was aware that agents , followed by the sheriff and his deputies , were inside the barn now , that one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents everywhere , searching the barn , corner to corner , searching every inch of the tack room . Everyone was high , excited . They 'd gotten the boys back safely . They 'd taken down two psychopaths . Tammy Tuttle was conscious again , screaming , no way to keep the boys from hearing her , though he tried . They held her down on the floor . She was yelling and cursing at Savich as she cradled her arm , yelling that the Ghouls would get him , she would lead them to him , that he was dead meat , and so were those Little Bloods . Savich felt the boys nearly dissolve against him , their terror palpable . Then one of the agents slammed his fist into her jaw . He looked up , grinning . " Took her out of her pain . Did n't like to see such a fine , upstanding young lady in such misery . " " Thank you , " Savich said . " Rob , Donny , she 's not going to hurt anyone ever again . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she looked angry enough to spit nails . She did n't say anything , just put her arms around the two boys . The paramedics came through with stretchers . Big Bob , the lead , who had a twenty-two-inch neck , looked at the two agents comforting the boys and just held up his hand . He said to the three men behind him , " Let 's just wait here a moment . I think these boys are getting the medicine they need right now . See to that woman . The guy is gone . " Three hours later , the old barn was finally empty again , all evidence , mainly food refuse , pizza boxes , some chains and shackles , a good four dozen candy bar wrappers , carted away . Both Tuttles had been removed , Tammy still alive . The boys were taken immediately to their parents , who were waiting at the sheriff 's office in Stewartville , Maryland . From there they 'd go on to the local hospital to be checked out . The FBI would n't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of days , giving them time to calm down before being questioned . All the agents drove back to FBI headquarters , to the Criminal Apprehension Unit on the fifth floor , to write up their reports . Everyone was bouncing off the walls . They 'd won . High fives , slaps on the back . No screwups , no false leads . They had n't been too late to save the boys . " Just look at all the testosterone flying around , " Sherlock said as she walked into the office . Then she laughed . No one could talk about anything but how Savich had brought them down . Savich called all the agents who had participated in the raid together . " When the barn doors swung in , did anyone see anything ? " No one had seen a thing . " Did anyone see anything strange coming out of the barn , anything at all ? " There was n't a word spoken around the big conference table . Then Sherlock said , " We did n't see anything , Dillon . The barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air , but that was it . " She looked around at the other agents . No one had seen any more than that . " We did n't see anything coming out of the barn either . " " The Tuttles called them Ghouls , " Savich said slowly . " They looked so real I actually shot at one of them . It was then that they seemed to dissipate , to disappear . I 'm being as objective as I can . Understand , I did n't want to see anything out of the ordinary . But I did see something . I want to believe that it was some sort of dust devil that broke into two parts , but I do n't know , I just do n't know . If anyone can come up with an explanation , I 'd like to hear it . " There were more questions , more endless speculation , until everyone sat silent . Savich said to Jimmy Maitland , " The boys saw them . They 're telling everyone about them . You can bet that Rob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devils . " Jimmy Maitland said , " No one will believe them . Now , we 've got to keep this Ghoul business under wraps . The FBI has enough problems without announcing that we 've seen two supernatural cones , for God 's sake , in a rampaging partnership with two psychopaths . " Later , Savich realized while he was typing his report to Jimmy Maitland that he 'd spelled " Ghouls " with a capital G. They were n't just general entities to the Tuttles ; they were specific . Sherlock followed Savich into the men 's room some thirty minutes later . Ollie Hamish , Savich 's second in command , was at the sink washing his hands when they came in . " Oh , hi , guys . Congratulations again , Savich . Great work . I just wish I could have been with you . " " I 'm glad to see a man washing his hands , " Sherlock said , and poked him in the arm . " In a few minutes I 'm going to be washing my hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband here , the jerk . Go away , Ollie , I know you 'll want to protect him from me , and I do n't want to have to hurt both of you . " " Ah , Sherlock , he 's a hero . Why do you want to hurt the hero ? He saved those little boys from the Warlocks and the Ghouls . " Savich said , " After what I told you about them , do you spell ' Ghouls ' with a capital G in your head ? " " Yeah , sure , you said there were two of them . It 's one of those strange things that will stay with you . You sure you were n't smoking something , Savich ? Inhaling too much stale hay ? " " I wish I could say yes to that . " " Out , Ollie . " Once they were alone , she did n't take a strip off him , just stepped against him and wrapped her arms around his back . " I ca n't say that I 've never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have managed to get into some bad situations . " She kissed his neck and squeezed him even tighter . " But today , at that damned barn , you were a hot dog , and I was scared spitless , as were your friends . " " There was no time , " he said against her curly hair . " No time to bring you in . Jesus , I scared myself , but I had no choice . And then those howling wind things were there . I honestly ca n't say which scared me more-Tammy Tuttle or whatever it was she called the Ghouls . " She pulled back a bit . " I really do n't understand any of that . You described it all so clearly I could almost see them whirling through those barn doors . But Ghouls ? " " That 's what the Tuttles called them . It was like they were acolytes to these things . I 'd really like to say it was some sort of hallucination , that I was the only one who freaked out , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the wall , Sherlock , particularly since none of you guys saw a thing . " Because he needed to speak of it more , she just held him while he again described what had burst through the barn doors . Then he said , " I do n't think there 's anything more to do about this , but it was scary , Sherlock , really . " Jimmy Maitland walked into the men 's room . " Hey , where 's a man to piddle ? " " Oh , sir , I just wanted to check Dillon out , make sure he was okay . " " And is he ? " " Oh , yes . " " Ollie caught me in the hall on my way to the unit , Savich , said you were getting the bejesus whaled out of you in the men 's room . We 've got a media frenzy cranking up . " Jimmy Maitland gave them a big grin . " Guess what ? No one 's going to pound on us this time-only good news , thank the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of it , Savich , we want you front and center . Of course , Louis Freeh will be there and do all the talking . They just want you to stand there and look like a hero . " " No mention of what we saw ? " " No , not a word about the Ghouls , not even speculation about whirling dust . The last thing we need is to have the media go after us because we claim we were attacked by some weird balls of dust called into the barn by a couple of psychopaths . As for the boys , it does n't matter what they say . If the media asks us about it , we 'll just shake our heads , look distressed and sympathetic . It will be a twenty-four-hour wonder , then it 'll be over . And the FBI will be heroes . That sure feels good . " Savich said as he rubbed his hands up and down his wife 's back , " But there was something very strange in there , sir , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Get a grip , Savich . We 've got the Tuttle brothers , or rather we 've got one brother dead and one sister whose arm was just amputated at the shoulder . The last thing we need is a dose of the supernatural . " " You could maybe call me Mulder ? " " Yeah , right . Hey , I just realized that Sherlock here has red hair , just like Scully . " Savich and Sherlock rolled their eyes and followed their boss from the men 's room . The boys claimed they 'd seen the Ghouls , could speak of nothing else but how Agent Savich had put a bullet right in the middle of one and made them whirl out of the barn . But the boys were so tattered and pathetic , very nearly incoherent , that indeed , they were n't believed , even by their parents . One reporter asked Savich if he 'd seen any ghouls and Savich just said , " Excuse me , what did you say ? " Jimmy Maitland was right . That was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for so long that evening that he finally fell asleep in the middle of his favorite finger game , Hide the Camel , a graham cracker smashed in his hand . That night at two o'clock in the morning , the phone rang . Savich picked it up , listened , and said , " We 'll be there as soon as we can . " He slowly hung up the phone and looked over at his wife , who 'd managed to prop herself up on her elbow . " It 's my sister , Lily . She 's in the hospital . It does n't look good .
