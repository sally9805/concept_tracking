<p> Merging the observed , the imagined , and the photographically documented , Sharon Allicotti composes pastels of metaphor , symbol , and ultimately , endless possibility . <p> THE KINSHIP between poetry and painting is more than an association or a means of explication in the work of Sharon Allicotti . The connection is intense , inextricable , more like a marriage . This effect is indebted to Allicotti 's skill in composition and drawing , which she enhances with a luminous , engaging surface produced with multiple layers of pastel , often reworked numerous times , on printmaking paper . The paintings that result exhibit a demanding presence ; the intricate detail , rich color , and convincing forms beg for close scrutiny . " My work is the opposite of impressionism , of a fleeting glance , " the artist says . " It is a long stare . " <p> Allicotti 's creative process begins with life drawings of the figure or still-life objects , which she incorporates with landscapes and car interiors constructed from photographic references and her imagination . These seemingly disparate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking out . " The metaphor of containment has the greatest artistic opportunity for me , " she explains . " The interior , as intimate space , represents the contained sensation of the physical body , while the vast , abandoned landscape evokes the profound mystery of the mind . Contemplating the spare beauty and silence of the desert seems to empty the mind of the trivial  --  with the poetic taking its place . " <p> A concept for a new work may germinate in Allicotti 's mind for weeks , months , or even years before she brings it to fruition . When it involves a figure , one of her first tasks is to hire a model to pose in her studio for several sessions , at which time she makes charcoal and graphite sketches and takes three or four rolls of photographs . As she refines the pose , she is especially careful to avoid a " particularizing gesture , " as she puts it , which could trivialize the subject . " The figure demands a high level of involvement from the artist because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " We as human beings are focused on facial expressions and body language , and an artist must be constantly aware of that . " <p> For the landscape elements , Allicotti , who is a native Californian with an abiding attraction to the western landscape , drives to remote desert locations and explores the area , taking dozens of photographs from different vantage points as she absorbs the environment . She is especially attracted to the Mojave Desert and the area surrounding Randsburg , in eastern interior California . Here , the severely eroded landforms and random pieces of junk  --  presumably related to the mining industry of the region  --  ignited her imagination at first sight and have appeared in numerous paintings . Back in the studio , she compiles the photos into notebooks for reference . <p> Allicotti also derives the car interiors from photographs . As she develops a composition , she selects a car whose form will mesh with the overall concept for the work . She makes a point of omitting all the logos or distinguishing characteristics , such as unusual door handles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not on the make and model of the car . Unapologetic about using photographic references , the artist has little interest in on-site painting , preferring to focus on a careful staging of multiple elements , rather than capture a fleeting moment . Furthermore , for the cars , practicality dictates that they originate from photographs . " I could not begin to fit an easel setup for drawings of this size 21 ? x 42 ? to 55 ? x 42 ? inside a car , " she says . <p> In nearly every work , Allicotti includes a kind of still life , one that contributes both to the composition and the content of the image . In Back Seat View , Mojave Rain Pool , she designed the boots to correspond to the shape of the rain pool . The hat is a foil to the curve of the pool while it echoes the arc of the tire tracks , creating a circular rhythm . In addition , these items suggest a human presence , which lends the sense of mystery and otherworldliness that Allicotti finds so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the artist plans her still lifes very carefully , often adding the items late in a painting 's development , depending on what it needs for balance and interest . <p> Once she has assembled all the specific material for a painting , she makes several small preliminary compositions in graphite that combine her photographic references and observational sketches . After selecting one composition , she enlarges it to a full-size cartoon on a sheet of drafting vellum , using a grid . When a figure is included , she often modifies the pose from additional sittings in her studio . To achieve the most accurate likeness and a facial expression that both conveys nothing and yet possibly many things , the artist makes a study of the head in graphite at this point , sometimes drawing directly on the vellum cartoon . <p> Allicotti uses all her reference materials strictly as points of departure . " I 'm most interested in how the parts of the image fit together , " she says , " and how to relate the interior and the exterior . " In Tracks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poles in the photograph to establish a rhythm that leads the viewer 's eye beyond the figure into the desert landscape . She changed the shape of the car seats to correspond to the figure 's form and keyed their tonality to merge with the landscape , yet appear darker , to indicate their position in an interior space . For experimentation , she sometimes makes separate drawings on tracing paper  --  of still-life elements or the figure in a different pose  --  and positions them into the cartoon , often moving them around to find the optimum placement . Later , she modifies proportions or moves other items as necessary . <p> After she has resolved the composition on the cartoon , she grids it and transfers it with graphite and sometimes charcoal to a sheet of Stonehenge printmaking paper . She prefers this surface because it has minimal sizing , is durable , and offers a vellum surface but enough tooth to hold the pigment . Employing several brands of pastel  --  hard Nupastel sticks and Derwent pastel pencils for fine details and the softer Rembrandt and Sennelier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface painstakingly , with numerous layers that she blends with her fingers . The artist seeks a luminescent effect , saying , " I want to convey a restrained surface quality appropriate to the work 's quiet , meditative expression . " <p> In developing the colors , the artist relies on her observations , although she consciously selects and arranges the local color to establish a color scheme . As the work progresses , she continually adjusts the colors to harmonize with one another . Back Seat View , Mojave Rain Pool and South of Second Mesa are replete with subtle , complex color , for example , but their overall key is green and blue , respectively . " This process has much to do with the phenomenon of color ambience , or reflected color , " the artist explains . " Each color is affected by other colors in proximity to it , as well as the overall quality of the light . Since the subjects in my works are often from disparate sources  --  a model posed in my studio , a car in a driveway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of color ambience to make the necessary adjustments . " <p> Allicotti organizes her pastels by color in divided wooden boxes . Like all pastelists , she is obliged to keep many pastels on hand because she must have not only a specific hue but the tonal range of that hue , running from darkest to lightest . In the same way that an oil painter requires a variety of brushes to achieve different effects , Allicotti breaks and sharpens her pastels to suit her needs . Rarely does she use a pastel intact , and one tray of pastels contains many different-sized pieces . <p> One of Allicotti 's techniques for conveying a luminous surface is to apply a complementary underpainting . " I might lay down a drywash of reddish pastel in an area that will ultimately be predominantly green , " she says . " I generally continue to incorporate strokes of several colors in the process of developing an area . Sections that appear to feature the most subtle color frequently comprise layers of ' component ' colors . " As a realist , Allicotti strives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation , " meaning she must abide by the effects of color ambience . However , " science is certainly not the whole of it , " she notes . " I strive for plausibility , as opposed to mere replication , and , as such , my use of color necessarily serves the expressive idea of the painting as a whole  --  as an object as well as an illusion . " <p> With the specificity of Allicotti 's images , her approach must be laborious and painstaking because " nothing can be left to chance , " she says . For instance , in South of Second Mesa , the artist spent dozens of hours trying to capture a melancholy effect in the model , one that was " a compelling depiction of a person , with everything inside him , although not revealing anything , " she explains . In fact , at one point , she thought she had finished the model 's head , but revised it when she saw him again . Spending an additional 16 hours on it , she changed his eyes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that emphasizes his position as the composition 's focal point and at the same time suggests a disconnect , the sense of isolation that Allicotti wanted to portray . " I had n't quite captured his humanity the first time , " she remarks . " I had to spend more time and add more layers to bring out his most expressive qualities . " The effect is captivating and puzzling . Clearly , something has happened , or is about to happen , but the artist offers no clues . <p> Although Allicotti is interested in images that appear to be outside of ordinary space and time , she insists her work is not surrealist . Inspired by the paintings of Vermeer and other Northern Baroque artists , she hopes to provide the viewer with a similar poetic experience  --  one that reveals the visual world as full of mystery and possibility . In Allicotti 's hands , the apparent conflict between specificity and generality , interior and exterior , observed and imagined dissolves . And like any good poet , she leaves the rest to us . <p> Allicotti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California in Laguna Beach .
