<p> Oakland is avenging decades of entrenched blight , hammering property owners with millions of dollars in fines in a bid to spark economic change throughout the city . <p> The war on blight , one of the most aggressive in the Bay Area , reflects the East Bay city 's new political mood . Swift , stinging and dedicated to the idea of progress through economic improvement , it has created an urban stereotype befitting the times : The " little old lady with a cane , " as one city official put it , who calls in a blight complaint to exercise her constitutional right to live in a clean environment without depressed property values . <p> The city is championing that old lady in a grudge match against scofflaws  --  and slapping the scofflaws with the bill . <p> Since the city strengthened its anti-blight laws two years ago and urged citizens to use them , it has issued 14,000 complaints  --  for everything from trash cans left at the curb too long to dead goats . Three in four complaints start with citizen reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In addition , the Police Department has towed or forced owners to remove nearly 13,000 nonfunctioning vehicles parked or stored on private property , cracking down on lawn parking and casual junkyards . <p> " This is a very self-conscious effort at social engineering to get us on the train of economic revival in California , " said Claudia Leed , a deputy city attorney , who also said the push against blight dovetails with city projects to reduce crime , draw technology jobs and create housing downtown . <p> The city is defending itself , so far successfully , against a handful of complaints that its anti-blight laws go too far and step on privacy rights . Beyond the legal questions , the campaign touches historic sensitivities in a city that houses a disproportionate share of the region 's poor . <p> Many scofflaws are bottom-feeding slumlords that the city is trying to snag with its tighter legal net . Others , like Andre Young 's family , have simply hit bottom , often leaving blighted property as evidence of their slide . <p> An auto plant shutdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kansas to look for work , and the other half fell on hard times . After Young 's grandmother died in 1986 , no one was around to take care of the huge Victorian that had been in the family since before World War II . <p> Young , a janitor , recently won a legal fight to prevent the house from being publicly auctioned . Hoping to profit from the appreciation of West Oakland real estate , he came up with $18,000 to pay back taxes and property cleanup costs . He considers himself unusual in having had the savvy and the savings to be part of the neighborhood 's future . <p> " I believe that a lot of the people who could show other people how to do things , or ask an opinion one way or the other  --  they all left , " he said , referring to the city 's long era of economic and leadership drift . <p> But others are taking their place . For the first time in the collective memory of city officials , there is market demand for distressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard line on run-down real estate has helped to create that market . City-ordered residential demolitions have declined over the past two years as new or existing owners see value left after paying off a property 's blight bills . <p> " We have a list of people who are looking for fix-up properties that have city liens , " said one Oakland property investor . " The lien forces an owner to do something , leading eventually to demolition . The buyer is getting a very special price . " <p> This year , Oakland expects to collect $6 million from building code enforcement , compared with less than $1 million six years ago . <p> Fees start at $727 and quickly run up against a property 's equity if a complaint goes unheeded or unnoticed . Fees pile high if the city hires a contractor to clean up a property and sticks on a 25 percent handling charge  --  a business that has doubled in two years to $2.8 million . <p> One in four complaints is reported by a corps of building inspectors , which has doubled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discretion to give hardship owners time to comply . <p> State law gives cities the clout to clean up private property whose condition mocks community standards . Oakland 's approach combines tough economic sanctions , a checklist of what constitutes blight and high-level political clout , notably from City Manager Robert Bobb . <p> " ( Bobb ) raised holy hell and put the fear of God into everybody , " Oakland contractor Nathan Robeson said . " Produce  --  that 's the bottom line . " <p> The law 's parental finger wags at banks that hold weed-choked lots from afar , at the secretary of Housing and Urban Development , at bishops and bureaucrats , at urban farmers with noisy chickens , ducks and the odd turkey and at the heirs to deceased blue-collar workers whose labor once formed the city 's backbone . <p> With 68 complaints , the city itself is the most-cited scofflaw , tagged for weedy vacant lots and a report of rats and trash at a swimming pool . <p> The law jumped on a church that was drawing power from a 400-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-known lawyer , John Burris , about trash cans allegedly left too long at the curb . It complained about trash and a junky washing machine at a rental property owned by a former city councilman , Wilson Riles Jr . <p> " I do n't think it was unfair , " said Riles , who blamed a recalcitrant tenant for the mess . " There are not a lot of mechanisms for getting leniency , and I do n't think there necessarily need to be . " <p> Inspectors ' notes show the variety of infractions that irk city officials and neighbors . <p> " Four or five sofas in the yard " . . . " stench from 15 cats that live inside " . . . " garbage 3-feet high " . . . " vehicles filled with old mattresses  --  people living in the vehicles " . . . " three different colors  --  blight problem " . . . " bury the dead goats under the eucalyptus trees . Urgent . " <p> Oakland is pocked with blight problems that developed when hard-edged enforcement was expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . <p> The city has been waging a fight against a rental property on 32nd Street at least since 1974 . It is a mess in more ways than one . During a recent fire in the building , city records show , police had to be called in to protect firefighters from drunk , abusive tenants . <p> The owner denies the building is substandard and states in a court filing under a handwritten cover sheet : " No human being has standing to make another human being unhappy and homeless by taking away his hard-earned belongings . " <p> City officials say public demand for action against scofflaw owners is nowhere near being satisfied , especially in East Oakland . <p> " Some of the streets are looking better , but also some of us living in East Oakland are having a problem with them not cracking down enough , " said Jean Blacksher , an Oakland homeowner for 40 years . " Some of these slumlords have been here 40 or 50 years , and they feel they have a right to continue to be slumlords . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the bulldozers along what is perhaps Oakland 's most notoriously seedy stretch  --  a mile of MacArthur Boulevard at the San Leandro border . A motel and a store just went down and a second motel , owned by an Idaho couple , is next . <p> In the same neighborhood , the late Walter Mims was no slumlord . But he felt the law 's sting . <p> Mims ran a firewood concession that fueled most of the barbecue places in Oakland . His widow , Jackie Mims , argues in a federal complaint that a city inspector and pestering neighbors bullied Walt 's Firewood . <p> " The lady across the street said she could hear the noise , " she said . " One person complaining should n't be able to have that kind of effect . " <p> Calvin Robinson , a friend of Walter Mims , recounted the inspector 's numerous visits to the wood-chopping business . <p> " There 's a lot of poor people around , " he said . " You 've got to be able to talk to them . Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did his job by enforcing the code and using his discretion . <p> Ginger Windham 's mother , who lives in the Brookfield Village section of East Oakland , got a city warning last month to move her recreational vehicle or face a dreaded $727 ticket . Windham said her mother will comply but grumbled about being turned in by one or two neighborhood blight vigilantes over something seemingly so trivial . <p> Citizen complaints about unlawfully parked motor homes and the like , a city official told Windham , are helping Oakland to look more like San Leandro . <p> Her reply : " If you want it to look like San Leandro , get the dope dealers off the corner .
