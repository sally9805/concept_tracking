Preface This book counts several points of origin . The first is a lifelong fascination for the Mediterranean that springs from its rich history , the mosaic of peoples who live along its coasts , and the stunning beauty of its land and seascapes . A second motivating factor has been my students at the Naval Postgraduate School , many of whom serve with the U.S. Mediterranean fleet and in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia or Kosovo , or who are natives of Mediterranean nations . They challenge one to understand the importance of the Mediterranean as a maritime highway , a geographic link between and among continents and oceans . The " Joint and Combined " emphasis of U.S. military education encourages the study and practice of the interaction between air , sea , and land power in a multifaceted operational environment . While the combination of these three forms of warfare are conditions for victory in all theaters , their efficient interaction was especially vital in the Mediterranean theater in World War II . This requires that one consider the Mediterranean theater as a geographic and strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Mediterranean was more than the sum of its parts . Those who fought there had to engage over the sweep of a theater that offers a particularly complex series of operational as well as strategic challenges . The extreme variations in geography , not to mention forms of warfare , especially from 1943 when Italy signed an armistice and insurgency warfare kicked in on the northern shore of the Mediterranean , put pressure on generals and admirals constantly to reconfigure and adapt their armies , navies , and air forces to new conditions . As in the Pacific , victory or defeat in World War II Mediterranean campaigns came down to who fought more efficiently in a three-dimensional setting . But the land component in the Mediterranean was far larger than in the island-hopping Pacific campaigns . A military force that mastered one or even two forms of warfare , but was deficient in a third , found itself at a severe disadvantage . Initially the Axis united German proficiency in land and air warfare with Italian sea power to command the " central position " in the Mediterranean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Western Desert . But Axis air and naval power proved to be wasting assets . And while the Wehrmacht remained formidable right up to the last days of the war , years of Mediterranean fighting had shorn it of offensive capability , reducing it to desperate defensive campaigns in the mountains of Italy and the forests of the Balkans . Finally , victory was determined not only by how one fought , but where one fought . War is never conducted in a political vacuum , but is , as Clausewitz reminds us , " politics by other means . " In the politically complex , even volatile Mediterranean world , this famous dictum could almost be stood on its head . German and " Anglo-Saxon " generals particularly detested fighting in the Mediterranean , where every strategic decision , every coalition , every invasion proposal was prickly with political consequence . The British commander in the Middle East , General Archibald Wavell , resisted fighting in politically fractured Greece , Syria , and Iraq . French and Italian politics meant sleepless nights for Allied commanders right up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Axis failed to exploit its political opportunities in the Arab world and seriously mismanaged the political dimensions of its occupation of the Balkan Peninsula and Greece , with significant military consequences . This book , therefore , is a work of synthesis , one that attempts to meld the histories of the individual campaigns in North Africa , Greece and Crete , the Horn of Africa , Syria and Iraq , Tunisia , and Sicily and Italy , and the histories of the air and sea wars and the insurgencies fought out on , above , and around the seas . But this work aspires to be more than a litany of battles . I have examined the interrelationship of these campaigns in the context of a Mediterranean theater and a Mediterranean strategy to better assess the importance of the Mediterranean in its relationship to the larger war . Historians have not , on the whole , been kind to the Allied Mediterranean effort . From its inception , the Mediterranean was an " encounter " theater , a place where Italian and British interests intersected . Churchill opted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire , to demonstrate that London meant to fight to the knife against the Axis , to emphasize his distance from Chamberlain 's failed appeasement policies , to attract U.S. support , and possibly to redeem a Mediterranean strategy that had foundered at Gallipoli in World War I. As a consequence , Hitler was forced to intervene to rescue Mussolini . American strategy was grafted onto the original British investment at Roosevelt 's insistence , over the protests of his secretary of war and his chief of staff , who argued that intervention in the Mediterranean attacked no German center of gravity , and therefore constituted a wasteful diversion of American assets for the benefit of the " British empire machine . " The consequence of this Allied stumble into a poorly thought-out and " opportunistic " Mediterranean strategy was a dreadful slogging match in a theater in which the British and subsequently the Americans were outgeneraled and outfought around the shores of a sea of trifling strategic importance . British historian John Ellis complained that " the Mediterranean is consistently over-emphasized in most English studies of the war ... the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mediterranean did constitute a strategic diversion , " the overall impression , indeed , is of a remarkable lack of direction in Mediterranean planning , with key decisions taken off the cuff , simply because no one , least of all on the American side , could think of anything better to do . " Corelli Barnett called the Allied Mediterranean strategy a " cul-de-sac ... mere byplay in the conclusion of a war that had been won in mass battles on the Eastern and Western Fronts . " The Allies paid a heavy price for their opportunism because , by September 1943 , their Mediterranean commitments had been funneled into the blind alley of the Italian Peninsula . This led to the foreseeable consequence , once preparations for the invasion of Northwestern Europe got under way , of the two regions ' being treated as rival , rather than complementary , theaters . David Kennedy has called the Italian campaign " a slogan not a strategy , " and condemned that battleground as " a grinding war of attrition whose costs were justified by no defensible military or political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessment of the Italian campaign , nevertheless consider the Mediterranean portion of Allied grand strategy to have been a " failure " because , much as in World War I , the Mediterranean competed with , rather than complemented , the main Western Front . British historian John Keegan compares Italy to Wellington 's campaign against Napoleonic forces in Spain , one in which the soldiers ' " sense of purpose and stoutness of heart " are all the more to be admired " because of the campaign 's marginality . " " Their war was not a crusade , " he writes , " but , in almost every respect , an old-fashioned one of strategic diversion on the maritime flank of a continental enemy , the ' Peninsular War ' of 1939-45 . " This work argues that while the Mediterranean was not the decisive theater of the war , it was the pivotal theater , a requirement for Allied success . None of the Mediterranean theater 's staunchest advocates at the time-Churchill , Harold Alexander , nor Mark Clark-ever argued that the Mediterranean should or could replace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did believe that the Mediterranean was a vital prelude to the invasion of Northwestern Europe , and that it played a significant role in the defeat of the Axis . This book seeks to explain how significant that contribution actually was to Allied victory . In the process , it assesses the relationship of the peripheral Mediterranean theater with the main Eastern and Western Fronts . My argument is that it was impossible for the Western Allies to transition successfully from Dunkirk to Operation Overlord without passing through the Mediterranean . That theater was critical in forging the Anglo-American alliance , in permitting Allied armies to acquire fighting skills , audition leaders and staffs , and evolve the technical , operational , tactical , and intelligence systems required to invade Normandy successfully in June 1944 . Overlord was rehearsed in North Africa , Sicily , and Italy . By 6 June 1944 , the Mediterranean had worn down and ultimately dismembered the Axis . The " Peninsular War of 1939-45 " became Hitler 's hematoma , much as its " old-fashioned " 1808-14 counterpart had created an ulcer for Napoleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build up American forces so that he could impose Washington 's primacy in the Western Alliance , and therefore to shape postwar Europe according to U.S. , rather than British or European , priorities . To factor the Mediterranean out of World War II is to imagine a disaster of epic proportions , and a military outcome in the European theater far different from an unconditional surrender of Germany . Some who fault the Mediterranean strategy , like American historian Robert Love , blame it for delaying the invasion of Northwestern Europe , which , had it been carried out in 1943 , would have brought an earlier end to the Reich and preempted Stalin 's land grab in Eastern Europe . Love blames a combination of Churchill 's imperial ambitions and Roosevelt 's " vacillation " for " a wasteful , peripheral strategy in the Mediterranean " that allowed the Russians to overrun Eastern Europe and gave the Germans a bonus two years to strengthen their Atlantic defenses . At best , Italy was a pis aller , a series of " hesitant and flawed " operations that gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilians . The sad truth is that Sledgehammer/Roundup , the planned invasion of northern France in 1942 or 1943 , would certainly have collapsed in bloody disaster against a strongly entrenched German army , backed by a powerful Luftwaffe , with German wolf packs prowling among the Allied fleet supporting the invasion . Defeat would have throttled the Western Alliance , as U.S. strategy would have veered toward the Pacific . The political fortunes of Churchill and Roosevelt , not to mention Charles de Gaulle , perhaps even the stability of British and American democracy , would have been compromised . Hitler would have solidified his hold on the Continent , resistance movements would have become demoralized , and Stalin might have sought to cut the best deal he could with the invader . Postwar Europe , including its Mediterranean frontier , would certainly have been a far different place . Therefore , my argument is that the Mediterranean was vital to Allied success precisely because it forced the postponement of a premature invasion of Northern Europe .
