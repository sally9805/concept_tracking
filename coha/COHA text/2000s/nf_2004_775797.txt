Introduction : A Bowl of Curds // To imagine a time and place - say , the city of Oxford on a summer day in 1662 - you have to engage not only the mind 's eye and ear but also the mind 's nose . The warm odor of malt and corn flour rises from the boats landing at the wharves along the Thames . The stink of cured fish hanging in fishmongers ' stalls mixes with the soft smell of bread in the bakeries . The smell of manure is everywhere , in the open sewers , on the town common where cows graze , in the streets where horses haul wagons and coaches . Sometimes a coach rolls through the narrow gate of one of Oxford 's colleges , to be swallowed up behind a high , windowless stone wall . The chimneys of the college kitchens relay smoke signals to the surrounding neighborhoods , carrying the smell of roasting capon and mutton or perhaps a goose stolen from a nearby village by students . // On a summer day the perfume of the surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exotic scents of the physik garden on the High Street , a home to exotic species such as leopard 's bane , mimosa trees , Virginian spiderwort , and scorpion grass . Botanists gather their leaves and seeds and roots and carry them to an apothecary 's shop to be ground down , cooked , distilled , and mixed with sharp-odored hartshorn or spirits of wine . // Every building in Oxford has an internal signature of smells : the incense burning in the churches once again , now that the Puritans have been routed and the monarchy restored ; the roasted beans in the new coffeehouse on High Street ; the foul reek of the prisons , where thieves , Quakers , and various enemies of King Charles II languish together . But the strangest smells in all of Oxford can be found off the main thoroughfares , on Merton Street . Across the street from the gates of Merton College is a medieval two-story house known as Beam Hall . Its odors are almost unbearable : a reeking blend of turpentine and the warm , decaying flesh of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none but a handful of people in Oxford - in the world , even - would recognize as that of a nobleman 's decapitated and freshly cracked open head . // The room where his body is being dissected is something between a laboratory and a butcher 's shop . Knives , saws , and gimlets hang on the walls , along with pliers and razors , brass and silver probes , pincers , bugles for inflating membranous sacs , curved needles , augurs , mallets , wimbles , and bodkins . Syringes and empty quills sit on a table , along with bottles of tincture of saffron and a simple microscope , illuminated by an oil lamp and a globe of brine . Hearts rest at the bottom of jars , pickled . On a long table lies the corpse , surrounded by a crowd of natural philosophers . Depending on the day , the audience may include a mathematician who is laying the groundwork for calculus or a chemist who is in the process of turning alchemy into a modern science . Astronomers , doctors , and ministers come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know they are part of an unprecedented experience . They are anatomizing the soul . // An inner circle of men stands closest to the body . Christopher Wren , thirty years old and not yet England 's great architect , studies the exposed flanges and curves of the skull . He can sketch bowels and hearts as beautifully as he will later sketch a cathedral dome . Richard Lower , who in a few years will perform the first successful blood transfusion in history , severs the nobleman 's carotid arteries and slices the gristly cartilage between his cervical vertebrae . The finest dissector in all Europe , he serves as assistant to another man in the inner circle , the owner of Beam Hall , the man who has assembled this herd of natural philosophers within its walls - a short , stammering physician with hair that one neighbor describes in his diary as being " like a dark red pigge . " His name is Thomas Willis . // Willis has brought these men together this day in 1662 in order to come to a new understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin and then cut away the inner mask of muscle . They saw off the bones of the skull , prying away each one with a penknife or a pair of scissors . They snip the nerves that tether the brain to the eye and nose . All that is left is the brain encased in its membranes . Next Willis and Lower turn the brain upside down and gently peel away the membranes so as not to damage the delicate nerves and blood vessels at its base . Furrowed and lobed , the brain is liberated , and Willis holds it aloft for his audience to see . // Today , when we look at a brain , we see an intricate network of billions of neurons in constant , crackling communication , a chemical labyrinth that senses the world outside and within , produces love and sorrow , keeps our hearts beating and lungs breathing , composes our thoughts , and constructs our consciousness . To most people in 1662 , however , this would all have sounded quite absurd . When the contemporary English philosopher Henry More wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pith or marrow in man 's head shows no more capacity for thought than a cake of suet or a bowl of curds . " The brain , More wrote , was a watery , structureless substance which could not contain the complex workings of the soul . The idea that the frail flesh in our heads was capable of the soul 's work was more than just absurd . It bordered on atheism . If reason , devotion , and love were the work of mortal flesh instead of immaterial spirit , then what would become of the soul after death ? What need was there for a soul at all ? Henry More put the matter simply : " No spirit , no God . " // Exactly what spirits and soul consisted of and where they could be found were questions that had been asked and re-asked for well over two thousand years . At the beginning of the seventeenth century , most Europeans would have agreed that the soul was the immortal , immaterial essence of a person , which would be saved or damned by God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence at work throughout the entire body - making it grow to its destined shape , making it warm and alive , reproducing its form in children . Spirits were the instruments used by the soul and body to reach their goals . For many philosophers , alchemists , apothecaries , and mystics , the cosmos also had a soul , which channeled spirits through planets and stars to enact its will - spirits that could be harnessed by magic or alchemy . With each breath , the world 's spirits entered the human body and infused it with life and intelligence , uniting the soul of the microcosm with the soul of the macrocosm. // As widely held as all these beliefs were in 1600 , they were being steadily undermined . By the end of the seventeenth century , they would all be either obliterated or fatally wounded , and Thomas Willis and his friends were playing a crucial role in the transformation . Their grisly work in Beam Hall was the first modern investigation of the nervous system . Whenever Willis held a brain in his hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to the branchings of nerves and other anatomical details . He showed how the brain 's intricate structures could form memories , hatch imaginations , experience dreams . He reconceived thoughts and passions as a chemical storm of atoms . Willis called his brain project a " doctrine of the nerves " and coined a new Latin word for it : neurologie . // Although Willis and his friends were establishing the modern science of the brain , they do not fit the modern definition of a scientist . Some were alchemists who searched out the philosopher 's stone so as to be able to communicate with angels . Some were physicians who recommended carved-up puppies for clearing the skin . All of them were seeking signs of God 's work in a universe that had become terrifying and alien . They were scarred by civil war and hoped that a new conception of the brain would bring order and tranquility to the world . Their claims were often accepted not so much because they were true ( which , fairly often , they were not ) , but because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // These men of Oxford ushered in a new age , one in which we still live - call it the Neurocentric Age - in which the brain is central not only to the body but to our conception of ourselves . The seventeenth century saw many scientific revolutions , but in some ways the revolution of the brain is its most shattering triumph - and its most intimate . It created a new way of thinking about thinking and a new way of conceiving the soul . Today , some three hundred forty years later , the Neurocentric Age is more deeply entrenched than ever . At the beginning of the twenty-first century , thousands of neuroscientists follow Willis 's trail . They continue to dismantle the brain , but they do n't have to pull it from a corpse to do so . Instead , they can scan the positronic glow of neurons recalling the faces of friends , searching for a word , generating anger or bliss , or reading the minds of others . These scientists have started to isolate the molecules that these neurons trade and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have become comfortable with this new brain . Few will deny that the workings of our minds are the product of billions of neurons organized into clusters and networks , trading trillions of signals with one another every second . We demonstrate our comfort by buying billions of dollars of drugs in the hope of lifting our mood , calming our jitters , or otherwise modifying who we are , simply by boosting or squelching the right neurochemical signals . // This comfort may have come too easily . The big business of brain drugs belies science 's enormous ignorance about the organ . The maps that neuroscientists make today are like the early charts of the New World with grotesque coastlines and blank interiors . And what little we do know about how the brain works raises disturbing questions about the nature of our selves . In many ways , we are still standing in the circle at Beam Hall , with the odor of discovery in our noses , looking at the brain and wondering what this strange new thing is that Thomas Willis has found . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
