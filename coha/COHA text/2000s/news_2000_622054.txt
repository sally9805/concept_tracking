<p> SIERRA CLUB 'S SILENT PARTNERSHIP <p> Editor  --  There is a huge irony in the Sierra Club 's unwillingness to endorse Al Gore . How can the Sierra Club dare to criticize Gore 's environmental record when the Sierra Club has steadfastly refused  --  by matter of policy  --  to address America 's main environmental problem , our runaway immigration-fueled population growth ? <p> The hypocrisy is absolutely breathtaking . <p> How can the Sierra Club ignore the primary cause of our sprawl , air pollution , water shortage , school overcrowding , traffic , clear-cutting . . . and so forth ? ! They are far too intelligent to not understand this . . . rocket science is not needed here . This one is obvious . When you add people , you add environmental impact . <p> Wake up , Sierra Club ! Wake up , Mr. Gore ! The main cause of our environmental problems is population growth . And consider this : In the last decade , well over 90 percent of California 's population growth has been caused by exactly one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irony continues . It is absolutely clear that Mr. Gore also fully understands the disastrous effects of population growth ( see his book , " Earth in the Balance " ) . However , somehow , as vice president , he found it quite unnecessary to address or even consider our main environmental problem . <p> So , both Gore and the Sierra Club understand the problem , yet somehow neither mentions it . The Sierra Club even has a formal policy requiring its leaders to not mention it . Could it be that their silence on this pivotal issue has been purchased by those who profit from it ? Just wondering . . . <p> K.R. HAMMOND <p> Berkeley <p> REGULAR CHAOS <p> Editor  --  I 'm glad that baseball fans can ride Muni to Pac Bell Park , but the current scheduling system seems unfair to regular riders . Before and after games , many Muni trains are converted into " shuttles " that conveniently bring fans up to Market Street , where they can connect to BART or other transportation  --  but which terminate at Van Ness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get home from work . <p> Why all the fuss about making sure that the fans have a seamless trip on transit , while people who have to ride Muni every day have to put up with this , or walk home ? ! Surely a better solution could be developed that helps us all implement a transit-first policy . <p> ELIZABETH CHUR <p> San Francisco <p> HOW DARE YOU <p> Editor  --  By implying that support for the National Park Service , nonprofit groups , and/or government agencies also implies support for animal testing ( Presidio Park 's Survival Depends on Its Self-Sufficiency , June 7 ) William K. Reilly epitomizes the dilemma within which the Presidio currently finds itself . Through his inflammatory style he has put himself at odds with the statement by the Trust 's own executive director just two weeks before , that the " relationship with the Park Service is a cooperative one . " <p> Mr. Reilly goes further , however , by implying that the presence of nonprofit groups at the Presidio represents " merely filling its buildings . " He ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Park Service , the Presidio would be nothing " more than a freeze-dried Army base and an animal research lab . " How dare you , Mr. Reilly , speak to us in this manner , as a representative of the Presidio Trust Board of Trustees . <p> Perhaps Mr. Reilly should read the GMPA ( 1994 General Management Plan Amendment ) and realize that the Presidio was ( is ) meant to be a pioneer among national parks by creating a global center dedicated to the world 's most critical environmental , social and cultural challenges . Then perhaps Mr. Reilly should visit the Thoreau Center for Sustainability at the Presidio and witness the efforts of the 65 assorted " building filler " organizations and their endeavors to be more in this world than just the source of Mr. Reilly 's revenue . <p> There are many positive ways to resolve the Presidio 's financial future and there is enough creativity in the individuals who have associated themselves with its future to meet the GMPA 's vision of a future full of promise and possibility while still meeting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today is seeking for visions of the future that do not require humanity to choose between destroying our planet and feeding our families . If Mr. Reilly 's words truly speak for the Trust board , then we have reason to be concerned for the Presidio 's future . If they do not , then Mr. Reilly needs one more " former " after his name , and that is former member of the Presidio Trust Board of Trustees . <p> CHARLES BEEDY <p> Bio-Dynamic Farming and Gardening Association , Inc . <p> The Presidio <p> San Francisco <p> JUST FOLLOWING RULES <p> Editor  --  In response to a letter from Christine Giri of Newark ( June 5 ) and a recent column by Chip Johnson ( June 8 ) , I would like to clarify the policies of the Alameda County Library related to the privacy of lending records . <p> California State law ( Gov . Code Section 6267 ) provides that " all registration and circulation records of any library which is in whole or in part supported by public funds shall remain confidential and shall not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a person authorized in writing by the individual to whom the records pertain , or by order of the Superior Court . " ( Circulation records include any information about what books or materials people are currently borrowing , have borrowed in the past , or have on reserve . ) <p> In compliance with this law , the library does not release any information about lending records or materials on reserve without the written consent of the person to whom a library card is issued . An adult ( age 18 and up ) can give this consent for him or herself , or for a child ( up to age 14 ) for whom a library card application has been co-signed . Because library cards are issued to young adults ( age 14-17 ) without requiring a parent 's signature , the lending records of young adults would not be released to any person without their written consent . <p> The library sends a letter to the parents of each newly registered young adult notifying them that a library card has been issued , and encouraging them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to cause difficulties for any of our library patrons . However , we do intend to fully comply with the state law that protects the privacy of library records . <p> LINDA M. WOOD <p> County Librarian <p> Alameda County Library <p> Fremont <p> SCARY THOUGHT <p> Editor  --  William M. Burke bemoans what would happen under a Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice Scalia should George W. Bush be elected president ( Letters , June 10 ) . What is really horrifying is what would happen with a Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice Ginsburg if Al Gore is elected . The abominably egregious havoc that would result from such an unthinkable occurrence defies description and the execrable consequences are vastly too numerous to list . But it does n't require rocket scientist brains to see that this country 's gradual slide into the pernicious evils of socialism would be greatly accelerated and our few remaining moral fibers and trustworthy principles that have sustained this great nation since its founding would be summarily obliterated . <p> I hope Mr. Burke or any American never sees such a calamitous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Ramon <p> ALL THE MORE REASON <p> Editor  --  Although it causes him anguish , William M. Burke opines that a " Bush Court " would not only have Scalia as its Chief Justice but would " destroy all environmental safeguards while reversing such progressive decisions as Miranda and Roe vs . Wade " ( Letters , June 10 ) . Right on ! Just such a court  --  with President Bush appointing " perhaps four or five new Supreme Court justices . . . " is , in and of itself , the singular most important reason for electing George W. Bush president of the United States ! <p> THOMAS M. EDWARDS <p> San Francisco <p> ROADS TO RICHES <p> Editor  --  So Parking and Traffic boss , Fred Hamdun , tells Sea Cliff residents that they will go to the top of the list when city crews finally get around to installing traffic bumps . Why ? Because , according to your story ( S.F. Removal of Safety Signs Upsets Sea Cliff Residents , June 13 ) the neighborhood 's rich residents will pay for the bumps themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if traffic in the Mission or Ingleside or other poorer neighborhoods has proven more deadly . So what if other parts of town have wider streets , faster and heavier traffic , or higher numbers of children , elderly , or the disabled . Hamdun 's message is clear : In our less kind , less gentle San Franci$co , if you 've got the bucks , you get the bumps . <p> BILL YARD <p> San Francisco
