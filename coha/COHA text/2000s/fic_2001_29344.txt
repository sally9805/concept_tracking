Carolina Sullivan needed a man 's body desperately . She scanned the humming cruise ship , working a knot in her neck . " What about the muscular guy by the stairs ? " Her design assistant squinted into the streaming Caribbean sunlight , oblivious to the glories of St. Thomas rising in the distance . " Too pretty . He bloody well knows it , too . " " You 're probably right . " The wind ruffled Carly 's short red hair as she studied the man in question . Neither the flawless sky nor the shimmering expanse of tropical ocean helped her relax . " What about the young Van Damme type lounging by the deck chairs ? " " Definitely YBG . " Young blond god . Carly knew the code perfectly by now : DDT : Drop dead thighs CTDF : Chest to die for HAA : Heart attack abs " I saw him in GQ last month . " Carly sighed . " We need someone completely fresh . " " So you keep telling me . " Carly 's assistant rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've covered every deck on this misbegotten boat . " " Ship , " Carly corrected her absently . " Whatever . If we do n't find a man here , we 're sunk . " A former model with impeccable taste , Daphne Brandon was also Carly 's dearest friend , and she had happily agreed to pinch-hit for Carly 's regular assistant , who was enjoying her honeymoon in Tahiti . In the past five years Carly and Daphne had become deeply involved in their own pursuits , forced to maintain their friendship via cell phone and E-mail , and it had been a happy coincidence that Carly 's assistant had gotten married just when Daphne had some free time . In the early days of her career , Carlyhad honed her photographic skills with the help of Daphne 's practical experience on the other side of the camera , and being teamed up again now was a dream come true . If it were n't for Carly 's current problem , the assignment would have been sheer pleasure . Instead of absolute agony . Daphne stared at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your regular assistant , I had no idea you 'd have me checking out half-naked male bodies . " " Is that a complaint ? " Daphne grinned . " Not a chance . " She scanned a circle of young athletic types engaged in a noisy game of volleyball . " What about one of them ? There 's not an inch of flab in sight . " Carly wrinkled her nose . " No , something 's missing . We need someone special , someone who projects complete control . At the same time he has to emanate brooding power , ready to explode under the right conditions . " " Yum yum , " Daphne murmured . A ball hurtled past and dropped into the pool , splattering Carly 's legs . " Great . There go my snakeskin sandals . I 'm glad they 're only fakes . " Daphne did n't answer . She pointed across the deck to a tall , beautifully muscled man climbing the ladder from the pool . Water skimmed down his rigid abs and dotted his powerful shoulders . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body a testament to controlled power . Carly felt a little punch of heat in her stomach . This was the one , she thought , mesmerized by those lean , rippling muscles . " Ground control to lunar lander . " Carly did n't answer . She was too busy imagining that lean body silhouetted against the warm golden glow of the sunset . She gave a soundless whistle when he tossed a towel over one shoulder , resulting in another display of rock-hard muscles . " Definitely HAA , " Daphne whispered . " I 'd say he 's your man . " After her years as a model , Daphne was n't easily impressed , but this man could inspire awe in the most jaded female heart . His abs were beyond stellar . In fact , his whole body was just shy of illegal . Carly dragged a hand through her hair . Experience had taught her that sheer looks were n't enough for a successful photo campaign . " I suppose he might work . " " Might ? " Daphne whispered . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my beating glands . " " Heart , " Carly corrected fondly . " And you 're married , remember ? " " Engaged . And just barely . " " The last I heard , your wedding dress was being designed in Paris . " " All of which might change any second . " Daphne gave a long sigh . " Just kidding . My misspent youth is behind me , I 'm glad to say . " She stared at Carly impatiently . " What are you waiting for ? " " He 's got the body , there 's no doubt about that . " Carly nodded slowly . " He 's got the walk , too . Quiet , with utter focus . " Carly raised her digital camera , framed a test shot , and captured her subject drying his extraordinary shoulders . The image in her viewer made her pulse spike . The man photographed even better than he looked , which was saying something . She rested her camera on her arm , frowning . " What do you think he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that does n't have to do anything but stand there . " " Be serious , Daphne . My whole project is at stake here . I need a completely fresh look for this set of commercials . The cruise people made that crystal clear before we left Miami . " Daphne clicked her tongue . " Too bad the original model they sent you did n't pan out . " Carly snorted at the thought of the well-coiffed California actor who had been booked for the commercials . Unfortunately , his body had turned out to be less than impressive , and Carly found out that his portfolio photos had been retouched with a blowtorch . She 'd immediately launched her search for a temporary stand-in , all too aware that the close-up shooting had to start immediately if she was to meet the tight deadline . Until now she 'd had no luck . She fingered her camera , studying the man across the deck . " He does n't look like your usual cruise type . He looks too focused , not like someone who 's here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , the pleasure would be anything but idle . " Daphne sighed . " The guy has to work out big-time . I 'd say he owns a chain of upscale fitness clubs . Something sleek , all teakwood and mirrors . Hot , hot music . " " If he 's that successful , he wo n't be interested . He would hardly need the money . " " Then forget money and appeal to his ego . Gush over his amazing body . " Daphne gave another appreciative glance . " It 's certainly worth gushing over . " " I do n't gush , " Carly said irritably , snapping two more quick shots that turned out even better than the first . Did the man ever take a bad picture ? " I especially do n't gush over men . " " No , you never did that , " her friend said thoughtfully . " I was always the one going overboard , gaga over some poet or bullfighter . It took me a few years , but at least I worked it out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Daphne smiled wickedly . " Looks as if it 's your turn . That man is the answer to all your dreams . You 'd be a fool to let him go . " She was right . Carly knew she had to bag this prospect . Every photographic instinct was on red alert , screaming that he would bring her elegant , atmospheric theme to life . Now all she had to do was drop the bait and reel him in.
