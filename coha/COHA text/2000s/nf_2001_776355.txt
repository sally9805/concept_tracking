THE IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL STATISTICS // Nineteenth-century Americans worried about prostitution ; reformers called it " the social evil " and warned that many women prostituted themselves . How many ? For New York City alone , there were dozens of estimates : in 1833 , for instance , reformers published a report declaring that there were " not less than 10,000 " prostitutes in New York ( equivalent to about 10 percent of the city 's female population ) ; in 1866 , New York 's Methodist bishop claimed there were more prostitutes ( 11,000 to 12,000 ) than Methodists in the city ; other estimates for the period ranged as high as 50,000 . These reformers hoped that their reports of widespread prostitution would prod the authorities to act , but city officials ' most common response was to challenge the reformers ' numbers . Various investigations by the police and grand juries produced their own , much lower estimates ; for instance , one 1872 police report counted only 1,223 prostitutes ( by that time , New York 's population included nearly half a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycles of competing statistics : ministers and reformers " tended to inflate statistics " ; while " police officials tended to underestimate prostitution . " // Antiprostitution reformers tried to use big numbers to arouse public outrage . Big numbers meant there was a big problem : if New York had tens of thousands of prostitutes , something ought to be done . In response , the police countered that there were relatively few prostitutes  --  an indication that they were doing a good job . These dueling statistics resemble other , more recent debates . During Ronald Reagan 's presidency , for example , activists claimed that three million Americans were homeless , while the Reagan administration insisted that the actual number of homeless people was closer to 300,000 , one-tenth what the activists claimed . In other words , homeless activists argued that homelessness was a big problem that demanded additional government social programs , while the administration argued new programs were not needed to deal with what was actually a much smaller , more manageable problem . Each side presented statistics that justified its policy recommendations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administration 's figures as an attempt to cover up a large , visible problem , while the administration insisted that the activists ' numbers were unrealistic exaggerations. // Statistics , then , can become weapons in political struggles over social problems and social policy . Advocates of different positions use numbers to make their points ( " It 's a big problem ! " " No , it 's not ! " ) . And , as the example of nineteenth-century estimates of prostitution reminds us , statistics have been used as weapons for some time . // THE RISE OF SOCIAL STATISTICS // In fact , the first " statistics " were meant to influence debates over social issues . The term acquired its modern meaning  --  numeric evidence  --  in the 1830s , around the time that New York reformers estimated that the city had 10,000 prostitutes . The forerunner of statistics was called " political arithmetic " ; these studies  --  mostly attempts to calculate population size and life expectancy  --  emerged in seventeenth-century Europe , particularly in England and France . Analysts tried to count births @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing population was evidence of a healthy state ; those who conducted such numeric studies  --  as well as other , nonquantitative analyses of social and political prosperity  --  came to be called statists . Over time , the statists ' social research led to the new term for quantitative evidence : statistics . // Early social researchers believed that information about society could help governments devise wise policies . They were well aware of the scientific developments of their day and , like other scientists , they came to value accuracy and objectivity . Counting  --  quantifying  --  offered a way of making their studies more precise , and let them concisely summarize lots of information . Over time , social research became less theoretical and more quantitative . As the researchers collected and analyzed their data , they began to see patterns . From year to year , they discovered , the numbers of births , deaths , and even marriages remained relatively stable ; this stability suggested that social arrangements bad an underlying order , that what happened in a society depended on more than simply its government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to underlying social conditions . // By the beginning of the nineteenth century , the social order seemed especially threatened : cities were larger than ever before ; economies were beginning to industrialize ; and revolutions in America and France had made it clear that political stability could not be taken for granted . The need for information , for facts that could guide social policy , was greater than ever before . A variety of government agencies began collecting and publishing statistics : the United States and several European countries began conducting regular censuses to collect population statistics ; courts , prisons , and police began keeping track of the numbers of crimes and criminals ; physicians kept records of patients ; educators counted students ; and so on . Scholars organized statistical societies to share the results of their studies and to discuss the best methods for gathering and interpreting statistics . And reformers who sought to confront the nineteenth-century 's many social problems  --  the impoverished and the diseased , the fallen woman and the child laborer , the factory workforce and dispossessed agricultural labor  --  found statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Statistics gave both government officials and reformers hard evidence  --  proof that what they said was true . Numbers offered a kind of precision : instead of talking about prostitution as a vaguely defined problem , reformers began to make specific , numeric claims ( for example , that New York had 10,000 prostitutes ) . // During the nineteenth century , then , statistics  --  numeric statements about social life  --  became an authoritative way to describe social problems . There was growing respect for science , and statistics offered a way to bring the authority of science to debates about social policy . In fact , this had been the main goal of the first statisticians  --  they wanted to study society through counting and use the resulting numbers to influence social policy . They succeeded ; statistics gained widespread acceptance as the best way to measure social problems . Today , statistics continue to play a central role in our efforts to understand these problems . But , beginning in the nineteenth century and continuing through today , social statistics have had two purposes , one public , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give an accurate , true description of society . But people also use statistics to support particular views about social problems . Numbers are created and repeated because they supply ammunition for political struggles , and this political purpose is often hidden behind assertions that numbers , simply because they are numbers , must be correct . People use statistics to support particular points of view , and it is naive simply to accept numbers as accurate , without examining who is using them and why . // CREATING SOCIAL PROBLEMS // We tend to think of social problems as harsh realities , like gravity or earthquakes , that exist completely independent of human action . But the very term reveals that this is incorrect : social problems are products of what people do . // This is true in two senses . First , we picture social problems as snarls or flaws in the social fabric . Social problems have their causes in society 's arrangements ; when some women turn to prostitution or some individuals have no homes , we assume that society has failed ( although we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or not giving children proper moral instruction , or something else ) . Most people understand that social problems are social in this sense . // But there is a second reason social problems are social . Someone has to bring these problems to our attention , to give them names , describe their causes and characteristics , and so on . Sociologists speak of social problems being " constructed "  --  that is , created or assembled through the actions of activists , officials , the news media , and other people who draw attention to particular problems . " Social problem " is a label we give to some social conditions , and it is that label that turns a condition we take for granted into something we consider troubling . This means that the processes of identifying and publicizing social problems are important . When we start thinking of prostitution or homelessness as a social problem , we are responding to campaigns by reformers who seek to arouse our concern about the issue . // The creation of a new social problem can be seen as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard cast of characters . Often , the leading roles are played by social activists  --  individuals dedicated to promoting a cause , to making others aware of the problem . Activists draw attention to new social problems by holding protest demonstrations , attracting media coverage , recruiting new members to their cause , lobbying officials to do something about the situation , and so on . They are the most obvious , the most visible participants in creating awareness of social problems . // Successful activists attract support from others . The mass media  --  including both the press ( reporters for newspapers or television news programs ) and entertainment media ( such as television talk shows )  --  relay activists ' claims to the general public . Reporters often find it easy to turn those claims into interesting news stories ; after all , a new social problem is a fresh topic , and it may affect lots of people , pose dramatic threats , and lead to proposals to change the lives of those involved . Media coverage , especially sympathetic coverage , can make millions of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need the media to provide that coverage , just as the media depend on activists and other sources for news to report . // Often activists also enlist the support of experts  --  doctors , scientists , economists , and so on  --  who presumably have special qualifications to talk about the causes and consequences of some social problem . Experts may have done research on the problem and can report their findings . Activists use experts to make claims about social problems seem authoritative , and the mass media often rely on experts ' testimonies to make news stories about a new problem seem more convincing . In turn , experts enjoy the respectful attention they receive from activists and the media . // Not all social problems are promoted by struggling , independent activists ; creating new social problems is sometimes the work of powerful organizations and institutions . Government officials who promote problems range from prominent politicians trying to arouse concern in order to create election campaign issues , to anonymous bureaucrats proposing that their agencies ' programs be expanded to solve some social problem . And businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own reasons to promote particular social issues . Public and private organizations usually command the resources needed to organize effective campaigns to create social problems . They can afford to hire experts to conduct research , to sponsor and encourage activists , and to publicize their causes in ways that attract media attention . // In other words , when we become aware of  --  and start to worry about  --  some new social problem , our concern is usually the result of efforts by some combination of problem promoters  --  activists , reporters , experts , officials , or private organizations  --  who have worked to create the sense that this is an important problem , one that deserves our attention . In this sense , people deliberately construct social problems . // Efforts to create or promote social problems , particularly when they begin to attract attention , may inspire opposition . Sometimes this involves officials responding to critics by defending existing policies as adequate . Recall that New York police minimized the number of prostitutes in the city , just as the Reagan administration argued that activists exaggerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition comes from private interests ; for example , the Tobacco Institute ( funded by the tobacco industry ) became notorious for , over decades , challenging every research finding that smoking was harmful . // Statistics play an important role in campaigns to create  --  or defuse claims about  --  new social problems . Most often , such statistics describe the problem 's size : there are 10,000 prostitutes in New York City , or three million homeless people . When social problems first come to our attention , perhaps in a televised news report , we 're usually given an example or two ( perhaps video footage of homeless individuals living on city streets ) and then a statistical estimate ( of the number of homeless people ) . Typically this is a big number . Big numbers warn us that the problem is a common one , compelling our attention , concern , and action . The media like to report statistics because numbers seem to be " hard facts "  --  little nuggets of indisputable truth . Activists trying to draw media attention to a new social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist on getting estimates of the problem 's size  --  how many people are affected , how much it costs , and so on . Experts , officials , and private organizations commonly report having studied the problem , and they present statistics based on their research . Thus , the key players in creating new social problems all have reason to present statistics . // In virtually every case , promoters use statistics as ammunition ; they choose numbers that will draw attention to or away from a problem , arouse or defuse public concern . People use statistics to support their point of view , to bring others around to their way of thinking . Activists trying to gain recognition for what they believe is a big problem will offer statistics that seem to prove that the problem is indeed a big one ( and they may choose to downplay , ignore , or dispute any statistics that might make it seem smaller ) . The media favor disturbing statistics about big problems because big problems make more interesting , more compelling news , just as experts ' research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their subject is a big , important problem . These concerns lead people to present statistics that support their position , their cause , their interests . There is an old expression that captures this tendency : " Figures may not lie , but liars figure . " Certainly we need to understand that people debating social problems choose statistics selectively and present them to support their points of view . Gun-control advocates will be more likely to report the number of children killed by guns , while opponents of gun control will prefer to count citizens who use guns to defend themselves from attack . Both numbers may be correct , but most people debating gun control present only the statistic that bolsters their position . // THE PUBLIC AS AN INNUMERATE AUDIENCE // Most claims drawing attention to new social problems aim to persuade all of us  --  that is , the members of the general public . We are the audience , or at least one important audience , for statistics and other claims about social problems . If the public becomes convinced that prostitution or homelessness is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done : officials will take action , new policies will begin , and so on . Therefore , campaigns to create social problems use statistics to help arouse the public 's concern . // This is not difficult . The general public tends to be receptive to claims about new social problems , and we rarely think critically about social problems statistics . Recall that the media like to report statistics because numbers seem to be factual , little nuggets of truth . The public tends to agree ; we usually treat statistics as facts . // In part , this is because we are innumerate . Innumeracy is the mathematical equivalent of illiteracy ; it is " an inability to deal comfortably with the fundamental notions of number and chance . " Just as some people can not read or read poorly , many people have trouble thinking clearly about numbers . // One common innumerate error involves not distinguishing among large numbers . A very small child may be pleased by the gift of a penny ; a slightly older child understands that a penny or even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy some things , ten dollars considerably more , and a hundred dollars a great deal ( at least from a child 's point of view ) . Most adults clearly grasp what one can do with a hundred , a thousand , ten thousand , even one hundred thousand dollars , but then our imaginations begin to fail us . Big numbers blend together : a million , a billion , a trillion  --  what 's the difference ? They 're all big numbers . ( Actually , of course , there are tremendous differences . The difference between a million and a billion is the difference between one dollar and one thousand dollars ; the difference between a million and a trillion is the difference between one dollar and a million dollars. ) // Because many people have trouble appreciating the differences among big numbers , they tend to uncritically accept social statistics ( which often , of course , feature big numbers ) . What does it matter , they may say , whether there are 300,000 homeless or 3,000,000 ?  --  either way , it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with smaller numbers ; everyone understands that it makes a real difference whether there 'll be three people or thirty coming by tomorrow night for dinner . A difference ( thirty is ten times greater than three ) that seems obvious with smaller , more familiar numbers gets blurred when we deal with bigger numbers ( 3,000,000 is ten times greater than 300,000 ) . If society is going to feed the homeless , having an accurate count is just as important as it is for an individual planning to host three  --  or thirty  --  dinner guests . // Innumeracy  --  widespread confusion about basic mathematical ideas  --  means that many statistical claims about social problems do n't get the critical attention they deserve . This is not simply because an innumerate public is being manipulated by advocates who cynically promote inaccurate statistics . Often , statistics about social problems originate with sincere , well-meaning people who are themselves innumerate ; they may not grasp the full implications of what they are saying . Similarly , the media are not immune to innumeracy ; reporters commonly repeat the figures their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // The result can be a social comedy . Activists want to draw attention to a problem  --  prostitution , homelessness , or whatever . The press asks the activists for statistics  --  How many prostitutes ? How many homeless ? Knowing that big numbers indicate big problems and knowing that it will be hard to get action unless people can be convinced a big problem exists ( and sincerely believing that there is a big problem ) , the activists produce a big estimate , and the press , having no good way to check the number , simply publicizes it . The general public  --  most of us suffering from at least a mild case of innumeracy  --  tends to accept the figure without question . After all , it 's a big number , and there 's no real difference among big numbers . // ORGANIZATIONAL PRACTICES // AND OFFICIAL STATISTICS // One reason we tend to accept statistics uncritically is that we assume that numbers come from experts who know what they 're doing . Often these experts work for government agencies , such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of their job . Data that come from the government  --  crime rates , unemployment rates , poverty rates  --  are official statistics . There is a natural tendency to treat these figures as straightforward facts that can not be questioned . // This ignores the way statistics are produced . All statistics , even the most authoritative , are created by people . This does not mean that they are inevitably flawed or wrong , but it does mean that we ought to ask ourselves just how the statistics we encounter were created . // Let 's say a couple decides to get married . This requires going to a government office , taking out a marriage license , and having whoever conducts the marriage ceremony sign and file the license . Periodically , officials add up the number of marriage licenses filed and issue a report on the number of marriages . This is a relatively straightforward bit of recordkeeping , but notice that the accuracy of marriage statistics depends on couples ' willingness to cooperate with the procedures . For example , imagine a couple who decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they might even have a wedding ceremony , yet their marriage will not be counted in the official record . Or consider couples that cohabit  --  live together  --  without getting married ; there is no official record of their living arrangement . And there is the added problem of recordkeeping : is the system for filing , recording , and generally keeping track of marriages accurate , or do mistakes occur ? These examples remind us that the official number of marriages reflects certain bureaucratic decisions about what will be counted and how to do the counting . // Now consider a more complicated example : statistics on suicide . Typically , a coroner decides which deaths are suicides . This can be relatively straightforward : perhaps the dead individual left behind a note clearly stating an intent to commit suicide . But often there is no note , and the coroner must gather evidence that points to suicide  --  perhaps the deceased is known to have been depressed , the death occurred in a locked house , the cause of death was an apparently self-inflicted gunshot to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes here . The first is that the coroner may label a death a " suicide " when , in fact , there was another cause ( in mystery novels , at least , murder often is disguised as suicide ) . The second possibility for error is that the coroner may assign another cause of death to what was , in fact , a suicide . This is probably a greater risk , because some people who kill themselves want to conceal that fact ( for example , some single-car automobile fatalities are suicides designed to look like accidents so that the individual 's family can avoid embarrassment or collect life insurance benefits ) . In addition , surviving family members may be ashamed by a relative 's suicide , and they may press the coroner to assign another cause of death , such as accident . // In other words , official records of suicide reflect coroners ' judgments about the causes of death in what can be ambiguous circumstances . The act of suicide tends to be secretive  --  it usually occurs in private  --  and the motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some deaths as " suicides " and others as " homicides , " " accidents , " or whatever will sometimes be wrong , although we can not know exactly how often . Note , too , that individual coroners may assess cases differently ; we might imagine one coroner who is relatively willing to label deaths suicides , and another who is very reluctant to do so . Presented with the same set of cases , the first coroner might find many more suicides than the second . // ( Continues ... ) //
