Why had this happened ? Why , of all the children , was Kyle the one ? Back in the car after stopping for gas , Denise hit the highway again , staying ahead of the storm . For the next twenty minutes rain fell steadily but not ominously , and she watched the wipers push the water back and forth while she made her way back to Edenton , North Carolina . Her Diet Coke sat between the emergency brake and the drivers seat , and though she knew it wasnt good for her , she finished the last of it and immediately wished shed bought another . The extra caffeine , she hoped , would keep her alert and focused on the drive , instead of on Kyle . But Kyle was always there . Kyle . What could she say ? Hed once been part of her , shed heard his heart beating at twelve weeks , shed felt his movements within her the last five months of her pregnancy . After his birth , while still in the delivery room , she took one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful in the world . That feeling had nt changed , although she wasnt in any way a perfect mother . These days she simply did the best job she could , accepting the good with the bad , looking for joys in the little things . With Kyle , they were sometimes hard to find . Shed done her best to be patient with him over the last four years , but it had nt always been easy . Once , while he was still a toddler , shed momentarily placed her hand over his mouth to quiet him , but hed been screaming for over five hours after staying awake all night , and tired parents everywhere might find this a forgivable offense . Afterthat , though , shed done her best to keep her emotions in check . When she felt her frustration rising , she slowly counted to ten before doing anything ; when that did nt work , she left the room to collect herself . Usually it helped , but this was both a blessing and a curse . It was a blessing because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a curse because it made her question her own abilities as a parent . Kyle had been born four years to the day after her mother had died of a brain aneurysm , and though not usually given to believing in signs , Denise could hardly regard that as a coincidence . Kyle , she felt sure , was a gift from God . Kyle , she knew , had been sent to replace her family . Other than him , she was alone in the world . Her father had died when she was four , she had no siblings , her grandparents on both sides had passed away . Kyle immediately became the sole recipient of the love she had to offer . But fate is strange , fate is unpredictable . Though she showered Kyle with attention , it somehow had nt been enough . Now she led a life she had nt anticipated , a life where Kyles daily progression was carefully logged in a notebook . Now she led a life completely dedicated to her son . Kyle , of course , did nt complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike other children , never complained about anything . She glanced in the rearview mirror . " What are you thinking about , sweetie ? " Kyle was watching the rain as it blew against the windows , his head turned sideways . His blanket was in his lap . He had nt said anything since hed been in the car , and he turned at the sound of her voice . She waited for his response . But there was nothing . Denise Holton lived in a house that had once been owned by her grandparents . After their deaths it had become her mothers , then eventually it had passed on to her . It wasnt mucha small ramshackle building set on three acres , built in the 1920s . The two bedrooms and the living room werent too bad , but the kitchen was in dire need of modern appliances and the bathroom did nt have a shower . At both the front and back of the house the porches were sagging , and without the portable fan she sometimes felt as if she would bake to death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was exactly what she needed . It had been her home for the past three months . Staying in Atlanta , the place shed grown up , would have been impossible . Once Kyle was born , shed used the money her mother had left her to stay at home with him . At the time , she considered it a temporary leave of absence . Once he was a little older , she had planned to go back to teaching . The money , she knew , would run out eventually , and she had to earn a living . Besides , teaching was something shed loved . Shed missed her students and fellow teachers after her first week away . Now , years later , she was still at home with Kyle and the world of teaching in a school was nothing but a vague and distant memory , something more akin to a dream than a reality . She couldnt remember a single lesson plan or the names of the students she had taught . If she did nt know better , she would have sworn that shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of happiness , but life offers the realities of grief . Her father , her mother , her grandparentsall gone before she turned twenty-one . At that point in her life shed been to five different funeral homes yet legally couldnt enter a bar to wash the sorrow away . Shed suffered more than her fair share of challenges , but God , it seemed , couldnt stop at just that . Like Jobs struggles , hers continued to go on . " Middle-class lifestyle ? " Not anymore . " Friends youve grown up with ? " You must leave them behind . " A job to enjoy ? " It is too much to ask . And Kyle , the sweet , wonderful boy for whom all this was donein many ways he was still a mystery to her . Instead of teaching she worked the evening shift at a diner called Eights , a busy hangout on the outskirts of Edenton . The owner there , Ray Toler , was a sixty-something black man whod run the place for thirty years . He and his wife had raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Copies of their diplomas hung along the back wall , and everyone who ate there knew about them . Ray made sure of that . He also liked to talk about Denise . She was the only one , he liked to say , whod ever handed him a rsum when interviewing for the job . Ray was a man who understood poverty , a man who understood kindness , a man who understood how hard it was for single mothers . " In the back of the building , theres a small room , " hed said when he hired her . " You can bring your son with you , as long as he does nt get in the way . " Tears formed in her eyes when he showed it to her . There were two cots , a night-light , a place where Kyle would be safe . The next evening Kyle went to bed in that small room as soon as she started on her shift ; hours later she loaded him in the car and took him back home . Since then that routine had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hours a shift , earning barely enough to get by . Shed sold her Honda for an old but reliable Datsun two years ago , pocketing the difference . That money , along with everything else from her mother , had long since been spent . Shed become a master of budgeting , a master of cutting corners . She had nt bought new clothes for herself since the Christmas before last ; though her furniture was decent , they were remnants from another life . She did nt subscribe to magazines , she did nt have cable television , her stereo was an old boom box from college . The last movie shed seen on the silver screen was Schindlers List . She seldom made long-distance phone calls to her friends . She had $238 in the bank . Her car was nineteen years old , with enough miles on the engine to have circled the world five times . None of those things mattered , though . Only Kyle was important . But never once had he told her that he loved her . On those evenings she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rocking chair on the porch out back , a book across her lap . She enjoyed reading outside , where the rise and fall of chirping crickets was somehow soothing in its monotony . Her home was surrounded by oak and cypress and mockernut hickory trees , all draped heavily in Spanish moss . Sometimes , when the moonlight slanted through them just right , shadows that looked like exotic animals splashed across the gravel walkway . In Atlanta she used to read for pleasure . Her tastes ran the gamut from Steinbeck and Hemingway to Grisham and King . Though those types of books were available at the local library , she never checked them out anymore . Instead she used the computers near the reading room , which had free access to the Internet . She searched through clinical studies sponsored by major universities , printing the documents whenever she found something relevant . The files she kept had grown to nearly three inches wide . On the floor beside her chair she had an assortment of psychological textbooks as well . Expensive , theyd made serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and after ordering them , she waited anxiously for them to arrive . This time , she liked to think , she would find something that helped . Once they came , she would sit for hours , studying the information . With the lamp a steady blaze behind her , she perused the information , things shed usually read before . Still , she did nt rush . Occasionally she took notes , other times she simply folded the page and highlighted the information . An hour would pass , maybe two , before shed finally close the book , finished for the night . Shed stand , shaking the stiffness from her joints . After bringing the books to her small desk in the living room , she would check on Kyle , then head back outside . The gravel walkway led to a path through the trees , eventually to a broken fence that lined her property . She and Kyle would wander that way during the day , she walked it alone at night . Strange noises would filter from everywhere : from above came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rustle through the underbrush ; off to the side , a skitter along a branch . Coastal breezes moved the leaves , a sound similar to that of the ocean ; moonlight drifted in and out . But the path was straight , she knew it well . Past the fence , the forest pressed in around her . More sounds , less light , but still she moved forward . Eventually the darkness became almost stifling . By then she could hear the water ; the Chowan River was close . Another grove of trees , a quick turn to the right , and all of a sudden it was as if the world had unfolded itself before her . The river , wide and slow moving , was finally visible . Powerful , eternal , as black as time . She would cross her arms and gaze at it , taking it in , letting the calm it inspired wash over her . She would stay a few minutes , seldom longer , since Kyle was still in the house . Then shed sigh and turn from the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
