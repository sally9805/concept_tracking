Joanna and Amy left home in the fall of their older sister Meg 's junior year at Yale . Meg had already gone ahead to New Haven three days earlier in her car-the family 's old green Subaru wagon , which had been her Warren Prep graduation present ( along with a trip to France ) . There would have been no room for Joanna and Amy had they wanted to drive up with her . The car was crammed to capacity with boxes and duffel bags and computers , Amy 's music stand ( she played the flute ) , and also her art supplies , including the drafting table , the base of which took up an annoying amount of cargo space . Their three bicycles had been awkwardly tied onto the roof rack with the assistance of Mike the doorman , whose helpful intentions were as genuine as his knot-making skills were poor . Meg had gone ahead , she said , because she needed those days to get started organizing the apartment , and also because of some confusion with her class schedule that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away in the loaded old Subaru with a certain belief that she could not have survived being with her family for even one more hour . She never liked analyzing and speculating about emotions , her own or anyone else 's . A very reluctant passer of judgments , Meg did on occasion discover that she was deeply disappointed by some person or turn of events . At such times she grieved horribly and felt burdened by the gravity of her conclusions . Although she had a reputation , both within the family and among her friends , as a good listener , Meg really had no idea of what compelled people to confide in her as they did . Too much information about other people 's feelings bothered her tremendously . What often struck people as wonderfully receptive and sympathetic listening on Meg 's part was , in actuality , inadequately conveyed distress , which she endured only until sufficient evasive chat could diffuse an overly intimate atmosphere . Joanna and Amy , on the other hand , at almost seventeen and just fifteen , always loved a good dissection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , and was not merely a consequence of their being a bit younger . These differences in temperament had long created a bond between the two younger Green sisters just as it caused some distance between them and Meg . From the days of earliest school-yard controversies , Joanna and Amy had believed with all their hearts in rehashings , begrudgeries , tattle-talings , and creative vengeance . One particular Halloween , the school year had gotten off to a particularly rocky start for Amy and Joanna . Their parents , Janet and Lou , concerned about unattractively pugnacious inclinations , had hoped to make a point by creating a mock , and mocking , family crest for the two littlest Green sisters . Amy and Joanna , in third and fourth grade at the time , were then gripped by an extreme Arthurian legend obsession , and they were utterly thrilled with the fancy nature of the ironic emblem that adorned the cardboard shields they carried to accessorize their matching aluminum foil suits of armor . Meg went that year as a Hershey 's Kiss , a typically diplomatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' costumes-each of the three outfits required some six hundred feet of heavy-duty Reynolds aluminum foil-and a conceptual distance as an unassertive piece of chocolate . The twin mock family crests-designed by Lou , executed by Janet with great care , and , regrettably , taken with happy oblivious literalness by Amy and Joanna-showed a multi-armed , **25;365;TOOLONG griffin perched over a small green house , with the motto emblazoned in carefully lettered mock Olde English : " NEVER FORGIVE , NEVER FORGET . " Joanna still had hers all these years later , tacked to her closet door . It would not have been possible for Meg to nourish with her sisters ' kind of devotion the terrible disappointment she now felt toward her parents . In the past few days , Amy and Joanna had become so savage that they could say anything and hurt anyone while seeming to enjoy it , while Meg had just become quieter and sadder . Meg was not an indifferent person , and was in fact made sad very easily by many things . Certain heartwarming television commercials for office products made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterizing pronouncements about matters large and small , always said Meg had a soft heart that melted like butter in the sun . ) A glimpse of a beggar on the street could be Meg 's undoing for the rest of the afternoon . She had been known to empty her wallet for a homeless-or allegedly homeless-person on numerous and not always well-timed occasions . " Meg went out with the grocery money and no blindfold " was Green family code for those nights when scrambled eggs or take-out food was on the menu as the consequence of a Meg encounter with some convincingly pathetic soul somewhere en route to shopping errands . One suspiciously robust and persistently present character , who sat perpetually on a stoop on their block with his dog beside a ragged cardboard sign claiming late-stage AIDS infection and homelessness , had been so successful in extracting grocery money from Meg over recent months that everyone in the family had come to think of him as " Meg 's miracle bum . " Their mother had an affair and they found out . By the time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already ended . Who was he ? He was Philip Hart , a graduate student in his twenties for whose dissertation-concerning obsession in the late novels of Henry James-Janet had been the adviser . That it was Philip Hart was especially shocking to Meg , Joanna , and Amy , as he was one of Janet 's cultivated collection of devoted , bright NYU graduate students , who , on countless nights , were invited to be part of the famously delicious and stimulating Green family dinners . Phil had struck them as so sweet and gentle and soft-spoken when he first came into their orbit the previous winter , so sensitive and funny , that the Green sisters had debated for weeks the question of his sexual orientation . Henry Jamesish in his own ambiguities though he may have been ( it was a small and bitter irony that the nature of his personal sexual desires should ever have been in doubt , let alone the object of now retrospectively mortifyingly detailed speculation on numerous occasions within earshot of their mother ) , he was a dear boy , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small crush on him that had lasted many months . It was especially unfortunate that it was she who found the damning evidence on the computer in the study . Home after an exhausting day of working as an arts and crafts counselor for six-year-olds in a summer program at the YMCA , she had merely been checking e-mail and then rummaging the family computer in an idle , mindless fashion . What she found was a beseeching message from Philip Hart begging their mother , his " little fuckbird " - yes , their own darling mother , a.k.a . Janet Green ! Somebody 's little fuckbird ! - the very same woman who had nourished them in so many ways , soothing their fevered brows with those same cool , slender fingers which had , apparently " inflamed the very core of " Philip Hart every time she " caressed " his " John Thomas " - not to break off with him because they were , after all , " in ecstatic cahoots " as no other man and woman had ever been at any previous time in history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about certain mutually experienced " midnight implosions " ; to hell with everything and everyone else , they were meant to be together . When Meg and Joanna arrived home from their summer jobs a short while later , they were stunned by the irrefutable meaning of what Amy showed them . " It 's got to be part of something he 's writing , " Joanna said unconvincingly even to herself , grasping at this flimsiest of explanatory straws , after her first reading over Amy 's shoulder . " Are n't these mostly some kind of literary references ? " " I do n't think you 're right , Jo-Jo , " Meg whispered sadly , from Amy 's other side . Her hand rested soothingly on the back of Amy 's neck . " This is addressed to her . It 's an e-mail . It 's not a big quotation from something , and there 's nothing here that sounds like Henry James , either . Except for the long sentences . There might be some literary references we do n't get , sure , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How can this be happening to us ? " Amy wailed . " Are Janet and Lou getting divorced ? I ca n't stand it ! I hate Philip Hart ! I hate him ! I want him to die ! Him and his fucking bow ties . What if he has AIDS ? What if Janet dies ? Then if Lou dies we would be orphans ! This is like something on television ! I do n't want to be part of an after-school special . " " Philip Hart was the one getting the after-school specials , apparently , " Joanna said bitterly , now having reread the damning message three times . There really was no other explanation she could imagine . " Did she answer this ? Is there a reply here ? " She reached over Amy 's shoulder and jabbed at the computer mouse , searching for sent messages or others from " phart@nyu.edu . " ( Philip Hart 's unfortunate elision would have provoked much mirth under other circumstances . ) " Nothing . No sent messages from her at all . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . Meg , Meg , mine , Amy again . No , nothing else of hers . Nothing else in the inbox . She either used her office computer or she 's deleted anything else on this one that was to or from him , I guess , except for this one message , and it 's dated , what , three days ago . Tuesday . What were we doing on Tuesday ? So , wait , where did it go ? It 's not in the inbox . Where did you find it , Ames ? " " In the trash , " Amy said sadly . " There were three things in the trash , and they were all Janet 's , but the other two were just regular NYU things . " Joanna relinquished the mouse and Amy clicked open the trash folder . " See , here they are . Blah blah the meeting , blah blah the committee . " " Oh , honey , you were so bored you were reading Janet 's old NYU e-mails in the trash ? " Joanna said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did you finish those Maugham short stories ? " " Yeah , whatever , " Amy agreed . " It is totally pathetic . I had started to practice my flute piece , but it was just too hot and my fingers felt like sausages . I do n't really know why I did it , I was n't thinking about anything , you know ? Do n't you ever just click around for no reason ? Sort of zoning out , you know ? Like reading a homework assignment from fifth grade when you find it in an old backpack , or like really , really reading all the insane personal ads in the back of Janet 's New York Review of Books ? Anyway , the trash does n't automatically empty every time you shut down the way it used to . Daddy told us at dinner , remember , last week , the night you burned the couscous , Meg , you know , when Janet 's nonverbal Swedish student-with the braids , you know , the one in the beautiful blue striped shirt-the night she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , so , whatever , and I was n't the one who turned the heat up , someone else did , but what 's your point ? " Meg replied impatiently . " Yes , so , that was the night Lou talked about the article he had read in some journal . Whosis , Astrid , Estrid , Pippi Longstocking , what was her name ? Anyway , she had accidentally trashed a chapter of her thesis ? Remember she was talking with Janet about that ? And that was when Lou said he had changed the settings on both computers in the apartment plus all of our notebooks so the trash is n't automatically deleted anymore , because he read about some scientific laboratory where they save every day 's actual trash in different wastebaskets for a week in case someone throws away an important equation on a scrap of paper or something . So I deleted the trash like maybe four days ago , because it was full of junk spam like all those ' Enlarge your penis now ! ' e-mails , and now we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think her name was Astrid , but who the fuck cares ? " Meg interrupted , having studied every word of the horrible message all the way through once again while Amy was rambling . " The trashed yet not-trashed message is here and we 're reading it . We get the picture . " She gave a small shudder and took a little step back from the desk , closing her eyes for a moment , needing physical distance from what she could n't help but read over and over . " What are we going to do ? " Joanna said . There was silence . " You guys ? Hello ? We have a major crisis here ? We need a plan ? Like , what the hell are we going to do ? " They stared at one another for a long moment . " Meg , you first , " Amy whispered , sucking on one of her knuckles . " Nothing , maybe ? " Meg suggested tentatively . She mentally calculated how many days remained of her summer internship at the literary agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could escape back to New Haven . " PhilHartPhilHartPhil , heart-fill , hurtful , " Amy murmured in the way she had of playing with words , often without even realizing she was doing it aloud . " FuckPhil . KillPhil . " " You mean just act like we do n't know ? " Joanna said dubiously . She could n't imagine this strategy working for an hour . How would they face their mother at dinner in a little while ? And every day after that ? " Do n't you think that 's an option at least , Jo-Jo ? " Meg , the voice of reason . " We have to tell Lou , " Amy interrupted . " Oh my God . " She turned to each of her sisters . Tears streaked her cheeks . She thumped her hands against the sides of her own head in anguish . " Oh my God . God . God . God . He 'll want to kill himself . We ca n't tell him . " " Do you think maybe he already knows ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her own and gently pull them down . She perched on the corner of the desk and swung a foot against Amy 's chair , rocking Amy slightly with each movement . She felt oddly detached and rational , not like her usual firecracker self at all , more like a scientist in a laboratory gazing at a microscopic specimen in contemplation of an experiment gone awry . " Lou knows Janet a lot better than we do , after all . And anyway , he 's not just going to do something crazy . " " How do you know ? " Amy moaned . " She 's been doing something crazy ! Who would have thought Janet could do something like this ? Maybe they 're both having affairs , I do n't know ! And you do n't know either , Jo-Jo , even though you think you 're such an expert on everybody in this insane family . " " Look , maybe it really does have some other meaning , " Meg said , attempting to start from scratch all over again . She hugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We do n't really have any way to know what it means . Continues ...
