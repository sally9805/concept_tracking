Jacksonville <p> Midnight . <p> Two young men walked along the bank of the St. Johns River , sporting shaved heads , sleeveless T-shirts and bituminous eyes that proudly announced : minimum wage 4 life . They gripped baseball bats halfway up the barrels . <p> " I hate fuckin ' bums . " <p> " So where are they ? " <p> " Supposed to be a bunch of them right around here . " <p> " Just like fuckin ' bums . " <p> There had been a light rain , and warm mist rose from the road . Work boots slapped across glistening tar and splashed through moonlit puddles . They approached the underpass of the Fuller Warren Bridge . <p> " Where the hell are those damn bums ? " <p> " Hold up . " <p> " What is it ? " <p> " Over there . " <p> " Where ? " <p> " Shhhhh . Get your camcorder ready . . . " <p> A two-tone 1971 AMC Javelin with split upholstery sat in darkness and trash beneath a downtown bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning the phenomenon of the nation 's trash elite inexorably percolating down to Florida like industrial toxins reaching our aquifers . . . " <p> A beer can popped . " You 're doing it again . " <p> Serge wrote furiously in his notebook . " Doing what ? " <p> " Talking to yourself . " <p> " No I was n't . " More writing . " . . . This travel writer places his money on time-release scumbag DNA . . . " <p> Coleman burped . " You always talk to yourself and then say you 're not . " <p> " I am ? Really ? That 's embarrassing . " He leaned over his notebook . " . . . The scumbag genetic factor is like hereditary blood disease or male-pattern baldness . At progressive age milestones , a series of rusty , chain-link twists in the double helix trigger a sequence of social tumors : Buy a pit bull , buy an all-terrain vehicle , get a DUI , sponsor a series of blue-ribbon slapping matches with your wife in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear in court , discharge fireworks indoors , get a DUI , forget where you put your Oxycontin , crash your all-terrain vehicle into your pit bull , spend money to replace missing front teeth on large-mouth-bass mailbox , get stretchered away by ambulance for reasons you do n't remember , appear on COPS for a DUI , run out the back door when warrants are served and , in a trademark spasm of late-stage dirtballism , move to Florida . . . " <p> Serge finished the transcription and turned to a fresh page . There was a period of silence in the two-tone Javelin ( orange and green ) sitting under the Fuller Warren Bridge . Then , a crunching of wax paper . A soggy tuna sandwich appeared . A travel mug of cold coffee came off the dashboard . <p> " Serge , " said Coleman . " What did you mean before , ' We 're on stakeout ' ? We 're not police . " <p> " Common mistake everyone makes , like the Constitution 's reserve clause for states ' rights . Just because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Serge took a sip from the mug . " This is our new job . " <p> Coleman finished unwrapping the sandwich . " I thought our new job was visiting hotels to fill out checklists for that travel website . " <p> " And on every hotel listing , there 's a section called ' local things to do . ' " <p> " I 'm not sure the websites want to send their customers under bridges at night in dicey parts of town . " <p> " That 's my offbeat niche : I give the people what they want before they know they want it . " <p> " But your new boss specifically said no more offbeat reports . " <p> " Everyone does what their bosses ask , and that 's precisely why you need to distinguish yourself from the herd . " Serge killed the coffee . " I stun them into paralyzed respect with my withering insubordination . First impressions are important . " <p> " They usually call security . " <p> " Because I made an impression . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He pulled out his hand and raised the twisted corner of a Baggie to his eyes . " Where 'd it all go ? Did mice chew through here ? Oh well . . . " He bent over . <p> " Thought you 'd outgrown that . " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " Everyone now knows coke is fucked up . You had an excuse for a while , because our hypocritical government lost all credibility by lumping pot in with crack to court the weed-bigot vote . Meanwhile , congressmen crammed all orifices with huge wads of cash from tobacco and liquor lobbies . But who would have guessed they were actually right about that stupid white shit ? " <p> Coleman raised his head and sniffled . " I just do a little bump now and then so I can stay up and keep drinking beer . " <p> " For a second I thought you were n't being productive . " <p> Coleman 's head suddenly snapped to the side . He pointed out Serge 's window . " What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Something moved under the bridge . " <p> Serge returned to his notebook . " Nothing 's there . You 're hallucinating again . " <p> Coleman squinted a few more seconds , then shrugged . He stuck his tongue inside the empty bag and reached under the seat for another Schlitz . " We need to make some money . " <p> " That 's what I 'm doing now . " Serge flipped a notebook page , stopped and tapped his chin with a pen . " I need travel-writing tunes . " He reached for his iPod , synched it with an RF transmitter to the Javelin 's radio and cranked the volume . <p> " . . . Fly high , oh , Freebird , yeah ! . . . " <p> Coleman rewrapped his tuna sandwich . " You 've been listening to Skynyrd all day . " <p> " We 're in Jacksonville . I 'm required to listen to Skynyrd . " <p> " Why ? Skynyrd 's from Alabama . " <p> Serge began punching the steering wheel like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! They 're Floridians ! Apocryphal motherfuckers . . . " <p> " Okay , okay , they 're from Florida . " Coleman set a wax ball on the dashboard . " I do n't know this stuff like you . " <p> Serge pointed at the ball . " You 're messing up my horizon . " <p> " The sandwich is soggy . " <p> " Soggy 's better . " <p> " Fuck that shit . " <p> " Your little chestnuts complete my life . " <p> " So Skynyrd 's really from Florida ? " <p> " Too many of our state 's native accomplishments are credited elsewhere . First Skynyrd and Alabama , then everyone thinks the Allman Brothers are from Georgia . " <p> " They 're not ? " <p> " South Daytona Beach . " Serge flipped down the sun visor and gazed up at a photo attached with rubber bands . <p> " You sure keep looking at that picture a lot . " <p> " I think I 'm in love for the first time in my life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
