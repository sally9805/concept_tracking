Unlike these instances contrived by people , however , surprises in astronomy have a distinct beauty and thrill . Any new cosmic phenomenon , whatever it is , has never been experienced by any other person . In 1572 , on observing the sudden appearance of a bright star ( now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brahe quickly wrote a pamphlet grandly titled " On a New Star , Not Previously seen Within the Memory of Any Age Since the Beginning of the World . " " I was so astonished at this sight , " he wrote , " that I was not ashamed to doubt the trustworthiness of my own eyes . " It challenged a notion , held since antiquity , that the starry heavens were unchanging . Using an innovative spyglass in 1610 , Galileo Galilei discovered the first moons circling another planet . He described the four moons of Jupiter as flying around the planet " at unequal intervals and periods with wonderful swiftness ... which were unknown by anyone until this day . " As with Tycho 's discovery , an astronomer had stumbled across something previously unknown . Nor has this trend abated over the centuries . While closely examining streams of radio telescope data in 1967 , Jocelyn Bell ( later Bell Burnell ) , a young British graduate student , uncovered the first observational evidence that neutron stars exist . Her suspect was emitting clocklike radio pulses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio astronomy seemed more astonishing and more nearly approaching science fiction . " In some cases , a scientific discovery , while electrifying , just culminates a line of research spanning decades or centuries . Take Edwin Hubble 's discovery of other galaxies , for example . Although breathtaking and historic , his finding was not surprising . Instead , it confirmed a viewpoint long suspected , settling astronomers ' lengthy debate on whether spiral nebulae were indeed other " island universes " or mere appendages to the Milky Way . Photograph THE ANDROMEDA GALAXY jolted astronomer V. M. Slipher ( below ) with an unexpectedly high velocity . Spurred by the discovery , Slipher observed many more galaxies , finding the first signs of the expanding universe . GLOBULAR CLUSTERS , such as M3 , contains stars that are almost entirely hydrogen and helium , as first discovered by Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin . Her finding came as a big surprise to astronomers in the 1920s .

A BIT OF SCRUFF on a chart recording from a radio telescope told Jocelyn Bell Burnell she 'd found something odd in the Crab Nebula . Not " little green men " but a pulsar , the first to be found . // But often a new fact walks up and hits astronomers in the face . Surprise occurs more frequently when astronomers try out a new instrument that enhances their vision , as with Galileo . And sometimes , it 's simply the result of sheer persistence - the dogged searching through vast surveys of celestial denizens - that turns up a rare , odd bird that no one was looking for , as with Bell 's neutron star . Little green men ? Bell 's discovery is probably the quintessential astronomical surprise . A neutron star is the core left when a massive star explodes as a supernova . A compressed ball of neutrons a dozen miles wide , the stellar remnant had been predicted , but nobody was looking for it . With no nuclear burning going on to provide power , it was assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undetectable . But astronomers did n't realize it could beep . A platoon of students and technicians , led by Cambridge University astronomer Anthony Hewish , had just completed a sprawling radio telescope near campus . It was scanning the sky for quickly varying radio sources , such as quasars . Bells job was to analyze the data scrawled on the chart-recorder paper - 400 feet a week . Reviewing the output one day , she spotted a bit of " scruff , " which on further examination was a repeated beep , a hundredth of a second long , occurring every 1.3 seconds . The astronomers briefly labeled it LGM for " little green men , " a jesting nod to the possibility it was an extraterrestrial communication . Continued observations , however , soon uncovered more of these " pulsars . " Within a year , Cornell University theorist Thomas Gold showed how a rapidly spinning neutron star could generate the signal . Expanding the universe The discovery of neutron stars was swift and sweet . But a surprise can also sneak up on astronomers , its real significance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slipher at Lowell Observatory set out to obtain a spectrum of the Andromeda Nebula ( M31 ) to determine its nature . At the time , no one knew if " spiral nebulae , " cloudy patches resembling whirlpools , were nearby gas clouds - solar systems in the making or far off aggregates of stars . It was painstaking work , requiring dozens of hours at the telescope before the nebula 's faint spectral features were captured . Expecting to find Andromeda moving around 12 miles ( 20 kilometers ) per second , like other stars in our galaxy , Slipher was astonished to find it rushing toward Earth at 200 miles ( 300 km ) per second , or 0.1 percent the speed of light . This was the greatest velocity then measured for any celestial object , and it spurred Slipher to examine other nebulae . By 1917 , Slipher 's list had expanded to some 25 nebulae , nearly all of them exhibiting tremendous speeds , up to 700 miles ( 1,100 km ) per second . Moreover , most of them were moving away from us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade for an explanation . In 1929 , Edwin Hubble and his assistant Milton Humason were at last able to confirm that the nebulae , by then known to be galaxies , are being carried outward due to the expansion of the cosmos . Seventy years later , in 1999 , the expanding universe begat a new surprise , when astronomers reported the cosmic expansion is not slowing down , as everyone confidently expected . Rather , the universe is accelerating due to the action of a yet-to-be-explained " dark energy " permeating space-time . Figuring out what this is could give us a profoundly new outlook on the cosmos . Unusual abundances ? Then there 's the surprise so startling no one wants to believe it at first . Beginning in the 1860s , astronomers were identifying elements in the Sun and stars that were assumed to be present in the same proportions as on Earth . If true , elements such as iron , silicon , and carbon would fill the universe . But around 1925 , Cecilia Payne ( later Payne-Gaposchkin ) , then a graduate student at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the first calculation of stellar abundances . She found two elements were off the charts . Her equations were telling her that hydrogen is as much as a million times more plentiful in stars than on Earth . And helium is about a thousand times more abundant than the heavier elements . Notified of Paynes unexpected finding , Princeton astronomer Henry Norris Russell informed her that it was " clearly impossible that hydrogen should be a million times more abundant . " With atomic theory so new , he was worried the simplest element was exhibiting abnormal spectral behavior . Pressured by Russell , a noted authority , Payne diluted her claim . Although she published her results , she reported the abundances for hydrogen and helium were to be " regarded as spurious ... almost certainly not real . " Yet just 4 years later , it was Russell himself who principally convinced astronomers of hydrogen 's overwhelming presence in stars . After collecting more spectral data from the Sun , he was forced to conclude that the Sun 's atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen , " with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ironically , he made a point of reporting that there was a " very gratifying agreement " between his findings and Payne 's original numbers - all the while failing to note his role in her labeling the data as " spurious . " Such surprises are part of astronomy 's lore and permeate the science 's epic history . There was William Herschel 's recognition of Uranus , the first planet found since the dawn of history ; the discovery of the Van Alien radiation belts around Earth ; gammaray bursts popping off like cosmic flashbulbs ; the universe 's bubbly large-scale structure ; and an unknown dark matter spread throughout space . Earlier this year , astronomers were stunned to see fully formed clusters of galaxies in the farthest reaches of the universe that were created just a few billion years after the Big Bang . This is far earlier than anyone guessed was possible . It is " like a kingdom popping up overnight on Earth , " said University of Michigan astronomer Christopher Mullis at the time . How to expect a surprise With such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arriving in the future . When that will happen , of course , is hard to predict - if we knew it was coming , it would n't be a surprise . But history teaches us that certain arenas are fertile ground for unforeseen revelations . Among these , one of the most fruitful moments occurs when a novel instrument comes on line , especially one that opens up a new field of astronomy . Many astronomers are betting that a surprise or two will turn up as they pursue one of the last predictions of Einstein 's general relativity still unconfirmed : gravitational waves , or ripples in space-time . To catch these , physicists have erected giant sensors in which laser beams race up and down miles-long pipes to detect the slight stretching and squeezing of space-time expected if a gravitational wave passes by . Each detector acts like a surveyor 's stake in a worldwide network . By triangulating their measurements , scientists might be able to trace the gravity waves back to the stunningly violent events thought to generate these cosmic quakes - for example , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two neutron stars or black holes smashing into one another . Given that gravitational waves have been predicted , what might the surprises be ? The most exciting possibility - the big , inyour-face surprise , the gravitational equivalent of Tycho 's bright stellar flare - would be a clear signal revealing an unknown astronomical object or physical process . Another surprise - a negative one - would be to discover that things astronomers already expect to be gravitational-wave emitters ( stellar-mass collisions and detonations ) do n't play out exactly as we think they do . This would reveal flaws in our understanding . Enough string Syracuse University 's Peter Saulson says another gravitational-wave source is cosmic strings , entities arising in some grand unified theories of physics . Flaws in the topology of space-time , cosmic strings can be thought of as extremely thin tubes , skinnier than an atomic particle , in which the energetic conditions of the Big Bang 's primeval fireball still prevail . Such strings could be exceptionally long ( spanning the width of the universe ) or closed loops , and they continually vibrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them emit gravitational waves . Even though such energetic objects would create sizable gravitational waves , the waves become extremely weak by the time they cross the universe to reach Earth . The stretching and squeezing of spacetime is expected to be smaller than the width of a proton . This forces gravitational-wave physicists to push their detectors to the limit , which may suppress immediate surprises . One way to see the signal in the noise is to assume what the gravity-wave signal will be like . Just as knowledge of human speech patterns helps you make out words from a weak , far-off radio station , gravitational-wave physicists use mathematical models - templates - of gravity-wave signals . When analyzed , signals that match the models will be detected , but those that do n't correspond will be written off as terrestrial or cosmic clatter . Other gravitational-wave physicists hope to pick up weaker " unmodeled bursts " by carefully scanning for more generic signals such as persistent tones or smooth changes in pitch , or even combinations of these that occur together in a kind of brief musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this method may see truly unexpected gravitational-wave emissions that unveil new physics , new astronomical objects , or surprising information about known objects . Search the familiar In addition to searching for novel objects , looking at collections of known objects might turn up some unexpected events . " In terms of the populations that create sources of waves , " says MIT 's Scott Hughes , " I think you have a little bit more room for a surprise . " For example , gravity-wave observers expect to detect binary black holes spiraling in and merging , but what if they see a large number of such events ? // QUIVERING NANOTUBES comprise string theory 's universe in place of particles . If correct , the theory may kick astronomy into new paths . // " That would be an enormous surprise , " says Hughes , " because I do n't know where we would get them from . " In other words , how could certain stars " arrange to die " so that many conveniently ended up as two black holes closely circling one another ? New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the search for extrasolar planets . So far , astronomers have depended on planets either being very massive or rapidly moving to pick them out . Consequently , only certain kinds of extrasolar planetary systems are revealed . None of the systems found so far closely resemble our solar system , with its rocky terrestrial planets close to the Sun and gas giants farther out . But planet-hunters are starting to look for transits - the passage of a planet between its star and the viewer - to detect a wider range of planetary sizes . By measuring the tiny decrease in light from the star due to the planet 's shadow , as well as measuring the time required for the crossing , astronomers can extract information about the planet 's size and orbit . Of course , the alignment has to be just right ( we have to be in the plane of the planet 's orbit ) and that means looking at lots of stars to find those lucky setups . But a NASA mission called Kepler , to be launched in 2007 , will monitor 100,000 stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth . This will be the perfect opportunity to find a planetary family looking like our own . Photograph A SHIMMY IN SPACE-TIME will tell astronomers a wave of gravitational radiation has passed by , perhaps from two merging black holes ( above ) . Racing laser beams look for gravity waves at LIGO , the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory ( right ) . // And once we can detect such planets , will we find that our solar system is the normal arrangement for planetary systems within the Milky Way after all ? That 's not clear . The first planetary systems sighted in the 1990s were found to be strange : planets more massive than Jupiter circling close to their suns . Andrea Ghez of UCLA points out that at the time , astronomers ' models for the formation of stellar systems " could n't produce any of these weird-looking planets . " The models had to be revised after the discovery . " There 's a whole cottage industry now of trying to explain how you get massive planets really close to the central star , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ghez adds , " I just suspect that we 're in for a few more surprises once we get down to being able to detect all the kinds of planets that are within our solar system . " Seeing new colors Help in sorting out such riddles of stellar systems may come from submillimeter radio astronomy . Submillimeter is a part of the electromagnetic spectrum that is not well-covered , says John Huchra of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics . " We 're just beginning to get telescopes that work reasonably well , " he says . " But , unfortunately , they have to be up at 18,000 feet 5,400 meters in high and dry conditions . My suspicion is that we 're going to learn a lot of things about star formation and protoplanetary disks , because submillimeter is a region that 's pretty good for tracking that kind of activity . " Turning to our own celestial backyard , exploring Mars and Saturn 's moon Titan have the potential to end the most suspenseful wait of all . " A profound discovery would be life , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The surprise would be if it were completely different , either in chemistry or in its method of storing genetic information ; or if it were not based on water . " And there 's always the hope the search for extraterrestrial intelligence will turn up some neighbors . Phenomena whose causes are poorly understood are also good targets for unexpected findings . Consider the supermassive black holes lurking in the hearts of most galaxies . When first discovered , these central black holes were thought to be associated only with quasars and other active galactic nuclei , which spew out huge amounts of energy . " So the discovery that most galaxies have central black holes was a surprise , " says Ghez . Then , it was a surprise to find that the size of the supermassive black hole correlated directly with the size of a spiral galaxy 's central bulge . " Presumably , " says Ghez , " that 's one huge hint as to how galaxies form . " Astronomers are often reluctant to make predictions too off-the-beam , but John Huchra is willing to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know antimatter exists , we 've never detected a large piece of it , such as an entire antimatter star or galaxy . There 's reason to believe these are not so common : to avoid emitting copious radiation from matter-antimatter annihilation , such entities would have to be isolated , even from the dusty , gaseous interstellar medium . But an antimatter star far out in the galactic halo might be isolated enough . " So , one surprise would be the detection of a significant antimatter object , " says Huchra . It 's easy for astronomers and astrophysicists to imagine all sorts of weird things , but ultimately , only a small fraction will turn out to exist . And things they do n't imagine at all will make a sudden appearance out of the blue . Surprises like that just come with the territory .
