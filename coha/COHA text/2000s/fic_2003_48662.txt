THE STORY BEGINS AT NINE O'CLOCK on a Saturday morning with one brother missing and the other brother lying back-down on the cool , linoleum floor with his arms and legs out in the form of a perfect human X. The boys ' father is outside the house , leaning against the family 's 1973 Chevy Monte Carlo , smoking an unfiltered Camel cigarette . That father is me , but I wish I were n't the father in this particular story , and besides , I am so much improved as a man and a father that I really bear no resemblance at all to that man leaning against that car , smoking a cigarette . So I will refer to myself in third person as the father . I will call my ex-wife , Penny , the mother . I 'll call the brother who is missing the baby , which is what we called him in those days , because he was only one year old and still in diapers and young enough to be thought of as the baby . Nowadays , I call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer a seven-year-old boy but a high school history teacher out in Portland , Oregon . I talk to him on the phone every six months or so and at the end of each phone call I am careful to say , " I love you , Matthew , " and Matthew is careful to say nothing at all . But back then we called him Matty , and so I 'll call the boy on the floor Matty and I will try and tell the story from his point of view , which , as everyone from my ex-wife to my court-ordered psychiatrist knows , is a point of view I rarely considered some twenty-odd years ago , when this story begins . <p> The baby is missing . Matty had been instructed by his parents to keep an eye on his younger brother , but instead he has spent most of the still-early morning lying back-down on the cool linoleum kitchen floor with his arms and legs out in the form of a perfect human X. His eyes are closed , too . It is interesting : you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was perfectly understandable how a boy could lose a brother in this way-but with the morning light pouring in the kitchen windows just so , you could close your eyes and still see the membranous shadow of your mother enter the kitchen and walk over to where you 're lying there lifeless on the kitchen floor and stand over you with her arms crossed over her chest and sigh dramatically through her nose and then set her jaw in such a way as to signify possibly huge trouble . <p> " What are you doing lying on the floor like that ? " the mother asks , and then , before Matty can answer , she asks quickly , like it is one word : " Where'syourbrother ? " <p> Matty opens his eyes , sits up , and says , " He 's disappeared , " by which he simply means that he has n't seen his brother in some time . But his mother does n't take the news in the manner in which it is intended . Her hands fly together in a tight white-knuckle shake and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and much more haggard and much less beautiful than she was when , say , the father in the story first fell in love with her . Matty knows this because his father says this to the mother in Matty 's presence , and often . <p> " What do you mean he 's disappeared ? " she asks . The mother is so frightened that she 's angry , and Matty suddenly knows that he will be blamed for his brother 's disappearance , eyes closed or not . Matty 's brother , the baby , is his younger brother and his only brother and still a baby , and their parents somehow operate under the assumption that Matty will naturally look after his younger brother and protect him and not let him drink any toxic cleaning solutions or stick his head in the gas oven or disappear without a trace . This does n't seem like an unreasonable expectation from the parents ' point of view , and Matty does n't find it all that unreasonable , either , even though he keeps forgetting about it . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks . <p> Matty considers the question . He does n't want to make his mother any more upset than she already is , but neither does he want to make up some fantastic story just to make her feel better . Making up fantastic stories is something Matty is good at and he does it with great regularity and proficiency . He could think of a couple big whoppers right now , without even trying . He could ! The baby has gone down to the mall and signed up for a four-year stretch in the army . The baby was out finishing his paper route and he 'll be back in fifteen minutes . The baby was out crawling a marathon and how long does a marathon take ? Sure Matty could say one of these things , but it seems possible to him that another one of these elaborate fabrications might upset his parents more than even a missing younger brother would , maybe . <p> " God knows , " the boy finally says , and then resumes his position of lying perfectly still on the linoleum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a severe coma . On the floor next to him is a copy of his father 's medical textbook . The textbook is open to a chapter devoted to comas , and what they look like , and what causes them , and what , if anything , you could do about them if you were a second-year medical student in a third-rate medical school like his father is . <p> One of the things Matty has learned from his father 's textbook is that there are different types of comas , and some people close their eyes when they go comatose , and some leave theirs open . Matty leaves his open this time , and so he can see clearly that his mother is already in full panic but is trying not to show it . It 's nine in the morning . The mother 's hair is wet from her just-finished shower , and she takes the time to try and put her black , dripping , seaweedy hair back in a ponytail . It is funny when you thought of it like that : the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matty 's mind of horses swimming in the ocean and getting tangled in beds of seaweed and then drowning , or of clumps of seaweed in the form of jockeys riding barebacked on Budweiser Clydesdales . These are funny images and Matty laughs and then he sees that he should n't : his mother 's hands are shaking now and her facewhich has fine sharp cheekbones and sun lines fanning out from the corners of her eyes and which is normally pretty except in the morning or in times of normal everyday stress-has gone so white that it is not even white anymore but rather the color of a lizard or a fish or some as-yet-undiscovered creature who has lived its entire life in a cave . <p> " Where is your father ? " the mother asks as calmly as she can . <p> " He 's outside smoking a cigarette , " Matty says , because his father is nearly always outside smoking a cigarette . <p> With this the mother gives up on her ponytail and tears out of the house , her wet hair whipping her cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slam behind her . Matty remains on the floor . What is he thinking ? Is he thinking about his brother who might be missing , or his mother who is so upset about it ? Is he thinking that he could have kept a better eye on his brother , as his parents have asked him to do repeatedly ? Is he thinking that he does n't know how he 'll live with himself if something happens to his baby brother ? Yes , he 's thinking all these things , because he 's that kind of big-hearted , sensitive boy . But Matty is also the kind of boy who , while thinking about these serious matters , is simultaneously entertaining the notion that he has slipped into a coma , because although he can see his mother facing his father with her arms crossed over her chest right outside the kitchen window , and although the kitchen window is open and he can see his mother 's lips moving , Matty ca n't hear her speak . Was deafness a part of being in a coma ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he 's actually playacted himself into a coma ? If so , Matty decides , that would be excellent . Matty reaches his left hand out to consult the medical manual on the matter , and then he hears his father say , through the open window , " Goddamnit , " and the boy knows that he is not deaf and has not willed himself comatose and is disappointed . <p> I have said that I will try and tell this story from the perspective of Matty , a perspective I ignored for many years . Because as you can tell already , Matty is a fine , smart , decent boy , a boy that any intelligent adult would be impressed by and interested in . Sure , he 's a boy who lives in his head too much , a boy who could easily drive his parents crazy , being so distracted by his own version of the world and not aware enough of the things actually going on around him ; but he 's just a young boy , after all , and what 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , Matty is a good kid , a kid any parent would be proud to have as their son , and I want to tell this story from his perspective , in part , to try and figure out why I was not proud to have him as my son . <p> But I wonder if Matty 's perspective has certain limitations that the father 's does not . Of course , this kind of thinking is typical of the father , who as everyone knows is a terrible bullying egomaniac who does n't give one damn about anyone but himself . But part of the way in which I am superior to the man I was is that I am willing and able to look clearly and honestly and objectively at all my former shortcomings , in a way , maybe , that Matty or anyone else I 've hurt in the past can not . For one thing , Matty , who 's only seven and besides is consumed with his fake coma on the kitchen floor , could n't know all the things contained in his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that goddamnit was the father 's standard response to the mother . The mother has just told the father that their baby is missing ; but if she had said that she needed something from the store , or if she had asked the father if he wanted to take a walk , just the two of them , then the father would have also said goddamnit , because he was a miserable , sullen man who did n't deserve to be married to his wife , which is something she realized not long after this story took place . When she did realize it , the wife promptly divorced the father and moved to Portland , Oregon . But Matty does n't know this yet . <p> Matty also probably does n't know that the father 's goddamnit referred , in a general sense , to the fact that the father was a second-year medical student in a third-rate medical school . Matty , of course , had heard his father call his medical school third-rate many times , but what he did n't know was that the father never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped reminding himself that he was a failure for being in such a lousy medical school in the first place , and that he was going to be a bigger failure soon because the father knew , at the time this story takes place , that he was n't cut out for even a third-rate medical school and that he would flunk out before the end of his second year . <p> So , Matty probably did n't know these things about his father 's goddamnit . Matty probably did know , however , that his father 's goddamnit referred to the fact that he had gotten drunk the night before and that he was still horribly hung over . The father got drunk every Friday night . On Fridays the father would have some of his friends over from the medical school and they 'd play euchre on the screened porch and drink bucketloads of Pabst . After drinking enough beer , the father was able to achieve a kind of amnesia about his overall failure in life , so much so that he allowed himself to complain bitterly about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about how backward-ass the medical school was in its , say , treatment of severe high blood pressure and how they 'd never do such a thing at pretty much any of the New York medical schools that had denied the father admission . The father was born and raised in New York , and his buddies were all from South Carolina , which was where the medical school was , but the father paid for the beer , and so the buddies , who did n't really care all that much for the father in the first place and certainly did n't care for him badmouthing their home state , the buddies as it turns out were awful , leeching hypocrites who were happy to let him have his say as long as he let them drink his beer . <p> Matty knew some or all of this because the father allowed him to sit on the porch , in the corner , while the father and his beer buddies drank and played cards . The father knew that Matty liked it , and the father also knew by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit there and pretend that his father and friends were not drunken , underachieving yahoos but rather great geniuses discussing matters of utmost medical importance ; he would listen to the rise and fall of their voices and the slamming of cards on the table and imagine long conversations in which his father , who was Jonas Salk , would take principled stands about medical ethics and patient rights and genetic experimentation and so on . Matty had an active enough imagination to sustain this illusion and was well behaved enough to sit there quietly in the corner every Friday and not say a word . The father would get drunk enough to feel proud of his son , sitting there so quietly in the corner , and in celebration he would drink even more , and soon he would be drunk enough to totally forget that his son was even sitting there in the corner imagining him to be the father he was not . This was what happened the night before the baby went missing : the father forgot all about Matty sitting in the corner and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his friends , " I 'm telling you for the last time , I will never , ever watch fucking NASCAR ! " and then stood up to emphasize his point and in doing so tangled his legs on the chair legs somehow and fell backwards in his chair and broke the chair and ended up back-down on the splintery wooden floor , not a foot away from where Matty was sitting there in the corner , staring at him in a way that told the father that the illusion of Jonas Salk had disintegrated and that the boy was left with his drunk father , who probably did n't even know who Jonas Salk was and who probably had n't read the chapter about comas in his textbook , either . And so the father , who was n't too drunk to be ashamed of himself , told Matty : " Get the hell to bed . " <p> So this is another thing the father is thinking of when he says goddamnit upon hearing the news of his baby son 's disappearance . He 's thinking of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , and he 's also thinking of how embarrassing it will be to walk around the neighborhood , from house to house , asking his neighbors if they 've seen his son , his other son , his baby boy , whom Matty , the older son , was supposed to keep an eye on and has not and who has now disappeared . <p> Matty continues to lie there on the floor , watching his parents mouth things to each other on the other side of the kitchen window . He ca n't hear what they 're saying , but he wants the words to be competent , reassuring , loving , and so they are . In Matty 's mind his parents are saying things like : " Do n't worry , he 'll be fine , I promise , " and " He 's got to be around here somewhere , " and " You are not a horrible mother , do n't say that . " Matty knows the opposite is probably true : that the mother is frantic , pessimistic , already on the verge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her dead baby , and that the father is probably agreeing with his wife that she is a horrible mother , even if he does n't really mean it , even if the father is too busy worrying about money and missing babies and life to be as pleasant as people want him to be . But as long as Matty ca n't hear these things , he can pretend otherwise , which , as everyone knows , he does very well . <p> Matty watches as his father finishes his cigarette , throws it to the ground , lights another one , and then stomps off down the street , toward a neighbor 's house . The father has big feet , a giant 's feet , and the ground shakes when he walks . Perhaps this is what the mother is thinking , too , because she watches her husband stomp away , shakes her head , and then turns back to the house . She enters the house , walks past her son lying there on the floor , and goes into the bedroom , comes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby 's name , turning over cushions and mattresses and opening drawers and cabinets . Matty still does n't move off the floor , but he 's no longer comatose ; he 's through with that , because if he were still in a coma , a real coma , then he would not fully be able to appreciate the blur of his mother 's ankles and feet and shins as they run in and out of the kitchen . It was a view available , only , say , to a worm or a dustbunny . The boy considers , for a moment , whether to be a worm or a dustbunny , until the mother , on her way out the door , kneels down next to him and says , " I could use your help ? " <p> It is a question more than a request : this is how the mother normally talks to Matty , because she sees the father order Matty around and she knows how awful it makes Matty feel and so she tries to engage him , to treat him like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this about his parents , knows the difference between his mother and father . Because in truth , he is more like his mother in every way and so obviously favors her , pays more attention to her than he does his father , treats her with more respect , even if she has that aggravating way of asking questions instead of just saying something . Yes , Matty actually listens to her , which is something the father wishes his son would do to him just once . Yes , for his mother , Matty exits his head , thinks carefully and realistically about the question a minute , and then says : " I 'll hold down the fort . In case he comes back . Or someone brings him back . " <p> " Thank you , " the mother says , and then kisses her son on the forehead . Because she realizes that while her baby is missing , her other son still needs her . She kisses Matty again and then runs out of the house . <p> Matty gets up , follows his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watches as the mother and the father scour the neighborhood for his brother . They are going from house to house , they are yelling out his brother 's name ( the mother 's voice as if coaxing a cat out of a tree , the father 's as if warning a dog to stay away from the garbage ) , they are knocking on neighbors ' doors , asking , " Have you seen our son , our youngest son ? " None of the neighbors have seen him . This goes on for about fifteen minutes , Matty watching his parents ' grim , futile search from the side steps of the house . They knock on fifteen doors in fifteen minutes , and they have n't even moved beyond the immediate neighborhood yet . There are so many more houses , Matty thinks , so many more doors to knock on , so many more people to say , " No , I 'm sorry , I have n't seen him . " Matty sits there and knows that the world is huge , big enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he shivers with the thought of his brother out there and at the mercy of the big , cruel world , shivers even though it is already ninety degrees out and the wind is like a weak spit of hot breath through the space in between your two front teeth . <p> After fifteen minutes , the mother returns to the house . Her eyes are pink , watery slits . She has the back of her hand against her forehead , a melodramatic gesture that undoubtedly she has learned from the TV , which is on so much that you ca n't blame Matty for being so flaky , the way he is , now and then . <p> " Has the baby come back ? " the mother asks , and then , since she knows that the baby has not come back , says : " Do you have any idea where your brother might be ? " <p> " He might be dead , " Matty says . To be fair , Matty intends this odd , even outright creepy statement as a fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still thinking of how huge the world is , how many doors there are in the world , how many people behind their doors you should be afraid of . <p> " What ? " <p> " It does n't look good , " he says . <p> " Do n't say that . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " the boy says . " It 's a parent 's worst nightmare , " which is something he also has heard on the TV , which goes to show that the mother does , in fact , keep the TV on too damn much and that it 's going to rot Matty 's brain if she is n't careful . Then Matty starts humming a funeral march , except he does n't know any funeral march . He does know " Pomp and Circumstance " from his kindergarten graduation ceremony , so he hums that . <p> The mother does n't even stop to question Matty any further ; she turns and runs away from Matty , past the father , who is stomping up the street toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The father sees the mother weeping hysterically as she runs by , and sees that she has come from the direction of Matty , who is sitting on the steps , watching his father process the sight of his weeping wife , watching his father put two and two together . The father stops for a second to follow the path of his weeping wife , then stomps double-time toward Matty , the huge world shrinking and shrinking until finally it is just the father standing there , hovering over his son . The father is like the sun , way up there hovering over his son , who way down there is the earth . This is what Matty is thinking , and he 's also wishing his father would say something , wishes something would come out of the mouth that is as straight and cruel as a razor . But the father does n't say anything : he just clenches his fists tight and bounces them against the sides of his legs . Matty is at eye level with the side of his father 's legs and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every time Matty hears the dull thwack of the fists against the legs he thinks of himself less as the earth or even a seven-year-old boy and more as something that makes a thwacking sound when hit by a fist . <p> So there is the father , standing in an admittedly threatening way over Matty . I am still the father , of course , and I have promised to try and tell this story from Matty 's point of view , and from Matty 's point of view it certainly seems like the father is about to hit the son . I know this is so , because as I said earlier , I above anyone else can see my past mistakes clearly and I am a much better man because of it . And it 's not just that I 'm a better man than I was . " I 'm an entirely different man " is what I tell Matty when we talk on the phone every six months or so and go over and over this same incident and over and over the same minute detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matty is still living in the past and ca n't get over things that happened twenty years ago . <p> " Well I ca n't just forget it , " Matty says . " I thought you were going to hit me . " Then , before I can say anything , he cites the relevant evidence against me , which is basically me hovering over him and beating my fist against my leg , which I did all the time when I was nervous anyway , and that garbage about me being the sun and him the earth , etc . When I try to explain myself , Matty just cuts me off and says , " I do n't want to hear any of your shitty excuses , Dad , " and then he hangs up . <p> A lesser man might cite Matty 's lack of respect toward his father and his rude slamming down of the phone as proof that Matty is hysterical like his mother and not entirely reasonable or even in his right mind , for that matter . But I 'm big enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more pathetic than a man like myself trying to make excuses about his past bad behavior , even if the badness of the behavior has been exaggerated to the nth degree . Because that 's not the kind of guy I am anymore : no , now I 'm the kind of guy who lives out his life quietly , modestly , the kind of guy who is comfortable in his own skin and who feels no need to make a big deal out of explaining away and defending all the bad things he did or that people thought he did . <p> Because if I were the kind of pathetic guy who felt the need to defend himself constantly , I would point out that while there will be some horrible violence in this story in the form of a serrated kitchen knife , and while it might seem that the father is highly sinister in the way he 's standing over Matty with his fists clenched , he is not about to strike Matty , nor has he ever hit Matty , nor will he ever . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put the father in some sort of context so that it would be easier to understand him a little better . Because would n't it be easier to empathize with the father if you knew that he is not so different from other men of his background and generation ? After all , Matty , as well-read as he is for a boy his age , ca n't know what it was like for the father to turn eighteen years old in a small mill town at the very bottom of the Adirondack Mountains in Upstate New York and expect to work for the rest of his life at a paper mill just like his father . Except the father turns eighteen at a time when all the mills go belly up or relocate to Mississippi or Mexico or wherever else there is cheap , non-union labor , and so he ends up not having a job in the mills , and neither does his father , who gets laid off just three years short of retirement . Matty does n't know what it 's like to wake up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the town 's main drag , and see the line of red brick buildings completely abandoned , their windows boarded up and dripping with tattered weather stripping . And Matty , who has his own bedroom and lots of nice toys and books and plenty of space to let that big brain of his run wild all over the house , ca n't know what it is like to live in an old Victorian that was for years your family 's own home until your father lost his job at the paper mill and was forced to move his family down to the first floor and divide the rest of the house into too many apartments with too many old welfare widows and too many young women alone with too many children who made too much noise early in the morning and late at night . And for that matter , Matty ca n't know what it 's like to feel the cold for nine months a year , especially when your family does n't have enough money to heat the house properly and the tenants who were n't there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are and how cheap your father the landlord is and the temperature keeps dropping and the snow keeps piling up , just like that anger you feel every time you stop to consider the dead mills and boarded-up businesses and overcrowded homes and the snow and the temperature that is falling , always falling . <p> No , Matty would n't know what it 's like to feel this much anger , this much desperation and violence piling up within him , and so he would n't know what it feels like to think you 've found a solution to your problems , either . He would n't know what it 's like to wake up one day and the snow is still falling , of course , and suddenly you just know that if you could just get somewhere warm then you would stop feeling the violence , that you would find the right job and the right girl and the violence would just melt away and you would be happy . Would n't it be useful , after all , to know such a thing about the father in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , like many other men of his generation and circumstances , went south against the wishes of his family and got a job working construction in the housing boom and went to school part-time and met the southern girl he wanted to meet , or thought he wanted to meet ? And would it hurt Matty all that much to know that the girl the father met and married changed after he 'd married her , that she was never satisfied , and that she convinced the father that he could do better than hammer nails for a living , that she nagged him into applying to med school . It was her fault then that the father wound up doing something he did n't want to do and was no good at ; and it was her fault that they had children when they were too young ; and for that matter , it was partly her fault that the violence the father felt up north came back , and came back worse because he 'd been a failure in two places now and not just in one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the father who is standing over his son , fists clenched ; and maybe it would n't be pathetic for the father to explain himself and where he came from , and would it be so wrong to have the father be seen the way he actually was , which is to say more human , less cartoonishly sinister ? <p> But anyway , none of this stuff matters , because I 'm not the man I once was and feel no need to defend myself . Besides , I 'm telling the story from Matty 's perspective and obviously , neither Matty nor Matthew is interested in hearing the whole story anyway . <p> Matty sits there for a while , watching the father bounce his fists against his legs harmlessly , nervously maybe but not menacingly at all , until the father says calmly , not at all meanly , even though he has a deep voice so it just sounds mean to a sensitive seven-year-old boy like Matty : " What the hell did you say to your mother ? " <p> Matty tells him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby brother , " He might be dead , " and then , " It does n't look good , " and then , " It 's a parent 's worst nightmare , " and then the humming of what was supposed to be the funeral march . <p> The father stares , dumbfounded , at Matty , and then asks again : " What did you say to your mother ? " <p> Matty , for all his intelligence , does n't quite get the father 's incredulity . So he repeats what he 's just said . <p> " Please do n't be so strange , " the father says . " Why are you so damn strange ? " Then , without another word , the father flies out of the house again , in search of Matty 's younger , not-strange brother . <p> And Matty is strange , and even though his mother-who is somewhere in the neighborhood weeping hysterically and overreacting like she is prone to do-even though his mother tells him he 's not strange at all , Matty knows deep in his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's very weird , even if he can not say exactly why it is so . He suspects it has something to do with the way he said , about his brother , " He might be dead , " and then , " It does n't look good , " and then , " It 's a parent 's worst nightmare , " and then the humming . But what was wrong with any of that ? By saying his brother might be dead , Matty did not mean that he wished his brother was dead . In fact , Matty 's saying " He might be dead " is akin to a father resenting the fact that he had kids too young and thinking that his life would be better off if he did n't have kids at all . But the father in this analogy does n't wish those kids were actually dead , and Matty does n't wish his baby brother was dead , either . Why would anyone wish such a thing ? But after all , was it not possible that the baby might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ? And did it look good , his parents running all over the neighborhood , ringing doorbells and screaming the name of his younger brother ? Did it not look , in fact , real bad in almost every way ? Were his parents not confirming , through their screaming , etc. , that what was happening was indeed a parent 's worst nightmare ? And could one be blamed for wanting to hum a funeral march with all this foreboding and death in the air ? <p> Of course , it was this kind of thinking that made Matty strange in the first place and aggravated his father so completely . And Matty wants to please his father , and wants to stop thinking strangely the way he does and make his father happy . " So just quit it , " Matty says to himself and then strikes himself in the temple with the heel of his hand to make himself stop thinking and then smacks himself again and pretends to knock himself stupid-not into a coma , mind you , not even unconscious , just a pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps that go from the ground up to the kitchen door , and that 's when Matty finds his brother , the baby , sitting under the steps , his sweaty blond hair matted to his head . He is staring at Matty with huge , happy , blue eyes . <p> So now you know that the baby was not missing , really , and while he is not entirely out of the woods yet in this story , there is no sense in pretending for drama 's sake that something terrible happens to him . Nothing does , no thanks to Matty or his mother or me either , I suppose , even though I 've done more than my fair share of looking after him in the twenty-odd years since this story takes place . The baby is now a handsome , twenty-two-year-old man named Steve who lives in my house and works for me in the landscaping business I started once I flunked out of medical school . The fact that he works for me and lives with me and has for his whole life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tolerant father I 've become and maybe always was , the more I think about it . I do n't harp on him for not going to college like his mother does on the phone from way the hell out there in Oregon ; and when he gets drunk-which he does most every night of the week-and brings home girls in the middle of the night and does what any good-looking young man would do with them and then leaves them crying outside the front door , I do n't say a word and am not judgmental one bit , unlike his mother , who says I 'm turning Steve into a clone of myself . When I ask her to clarify , my ex-wife says that I 'm turning Steve into a quote alcoholic sexual predator without an introspective bone in his body unquote , which is a hell of a thing for a mother to say about her own son . And while it 's true that he 's not the smartest guy in the world , not nearly as smart as his brother or his mother or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relatively happy kid who does n't get on my case for every little thing I did or did not do twenty-odd years ago , either . <p> Because this is the theory I 've arrived at since I 've been looking at things from Matty 's perspective : a son should never be more intelligent than his father , which is where Matty went so wrong and which is why I was never exactly proud to have him as a son . For instance , there was this time , about a year before this story takes place , when Matty was playing his first baseball game . Not that he was very good at it ; he was real bad , and he could n't throw or run or anything , but it was the kind of league where they play everyone . Matty was at bat and he swung at the first pitch and missed it completely . I was in the stands , like any good father would be , and I could tell that Matty closed his eyes when he swung , because the swing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four miles . So I yelled-and I was n't angry , but it might have sounded that way because I had to practically scream so that Matty would hear me all the way at home plate where he was standing-I yelled , " Jesus , Matty , you got to keep your eyes open to hit the damn ball ! " <p> Matty did n't keep his eyes open and he did n't hit the ball and he struck out on three pitches . I did n't think he even heard what I yelled to him until we got into the car , on the way home , and he said : " You have to keep your eyes open . " <p> criticizing my driving , which I 'm sensitive about in the first place because of all my speeding tickets and DWIs , which Matty knows about , and so I figure he 's pushing my buttons . Which , as it turns out , he 's not . <p> " You said at the game that I got to keep my eyes open to hit the baseball . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your eyes open . ' " And then he patted me on the shoulder and said : " I learned that one back in kindergarten , " which I figure is a cut on my grades in med school , which are n't what you would call stellar , and Matty knows that , too . <p> So you see what I 'm saying about a son being smarter than you are : how can you be proud of a kid who talks to you like that ? As a point of comparison , six years later , I yelled the same thing to Steve and he did n't correct my grammar . And he hit the ball . <p> Of course , if Matty would bother to look at things from my perspective , he might understand why he and I have the problems we do , and why I 'm so much closer to Steve than I am to him , and why I sometimes consider Steve my real son and Matty someone else 's . Because this is what Matty would see if he looked at things from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a son who does n't ; a son who ca n't keep track of his baby brother versus the baby brother who has the simple , good sense to sit under the stairs where it is cool and wait for someone to find him . <p> Matty and the baby stare at each other for a few minutes . The baby looks like a miniature blond buddha and is extraordinarily cute-everyone says so . Matty should be a little bit jealous of how cute his baby brother is , especially since Matty is a bit of a runt and pretty pasty and his mother has cut his hair in this ridiculous Roman centurion haircut . Any normal kid would be just a little bit jealous of a brother who is as cute as the baby , especially someone as homely as Matty . But Matty is n't jealous at all . He loves his brother , even if he does n't love him enough to not lose him for going on two hours now . <p> Matty knows what he should do here : he should haul his baby brother out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give them the peace of mind they so desperately need and deserve . But his baby brother looks so happy , sitting there under the steps in the dirt amongst the cigarette butts and lost pennies and God knows what else . Matty feels that it 's an honor to be allowed to sit there and watch the baby and be let in on the secret of his brother 's disappearance . But there 's this one problem : if the baby brother decides to make a noise now and someone hears him , then the secret is out before Matty even has had a chance to be in on it . <p> So Matty picks up a penny from the ground , gives it to his brother , and says : " Is this enough to buy your silence ? " The baby takes the penny , puts it in his mouth . Matty takes this to mean that they 've reached an understanding . Matty gets down on his knees , crawls under the steps , sits Indian style next to his baby brother , and then promptly forgets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so horribly lost just a minute ago and who is now right next to Matty , sucking on a filthy penny ? Because Matty is busy planning out the rest of his life and how it is to be lived underneath the wooden steps . This is what Matty is thinking : he 'll have to develop a taste for bugs-for fire ants and palmetto bugs and brown recluse spiders-because there will be nothing much else to eat under the steps . And then Matty wonders if he eats enough bugs , if he eats them every day , will he turn into a bug himself ? On the one hand , it would be easier to live under the steps if he were a bug , because if he were a bug he would n't mind sitting around in the dirt so much with the other bugs . On the other hand , if he were a bug , would he still eat other bugs ? And if his baby brother ate so many bugs that he turned into a bug , would Matty eat him ? Do bugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If bugs do not have this same aversion , does this make them superior or inferior to human beings ? It 's an interesting question , to Matty at least , and undoubtedly he would spend the rest of the day thinking about it if right then he did n't notice that his baby brother is choking on the filthy penny Matty gave him just a minute earlier . <p> The baby is really choking : he sounds like a car with a dead battery that wo n't start and his face is blue and he 's flapping his hands . Matty knows his baby brother is choking , but he does n't run for help or slap his brother on the back or anything . He just sits there , frozen , as if he 's watching a movie of someone else 's brother choking to death , because that 's what would have happened to the baby : he would have choked to death on that penny if his parents had n't come back home , exhausted and frantic and at each other 's throats about the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents coming up the walk because they are screaming at each other , but even then Matty does n't shout " Help ! " or " I found him ! " or anything . He simply sits there with this shell-shocked look on his face and luckily for everyone the mother and father stop screaming at each other long enough to hear the baby choking down somewhere at their feet . Matty watches as the father 's head appears in the crawl space under the steps , watches as the father sees what 's happening , grabs the baby , slaps him once on the back , watches as the penny shoots out of the baby 's mouth and the baby is saved . But still , Matty does n't move because he 's still thinking about being a fucking bug or something , and only stops thinking about being a bug when the father-who has had enough , Matty can see this-grabs him by the arm , drags him out from under the steps , hauls him to his feet , and yells right in his face : " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said several times that I wanted to tell this story from Matty 's point of view , etc. , but at a certain point you have to say : Enough . Because if all we get from Matty 's point of view are questions about the eating habits of bugs , who cares what he 's thinking ? So Matty 's perspective is out . The baby is too young to have a point of view , so he 's out , too . And the mother , well , she 's so overcome with emotion at finding the baby , and she 's so angry at the father because of some of the things the father said while out looking for the baby in the heat of the moment about her mothering skills , that her point of view can hardly be called reliable or objective . So she 's out too . So that leaves us with the father . And the father 's perspective is : What a day . I need a beer . <p> So the father decides to go down to the mini-mart and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mind you . The father simply goes inside , gets his car keys , comes back out , and finds Matty sitting in the passenger seat , waiting for him . <p> " What are you doing ? " the father asks . <p> " Sitting in the car , " Matty says , and then , before the father can say anything else , Matty rubs his right arm , which is the arm the father dragged him out from under the steps by just a minute earlier . The father knows this is designed to make him feel bad , and he does feel bad , because that 's the kind of father he is , even if he 's also the kind of father who feels a little resentful at being manipulated the way the son is manipulating him right now . The point is , the father says , " OK , you can come to the store with me , " but he 's also thinking , not saying out loud , just thinking , Fuck you , you little shit , like most fathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The drive to the store takes five minutes , and the father and Matty do n't speak to each other , which you would think would ease the father 's mood some , but does not , because the son keeps rubbing his arm , sitting there silently , and the father feels like the son is judging him somehow . The silence puts the father in a worse mood , so bad that the father buys his case of beer and then drinks one of the beers immediately in the parking lot , before he even gets back in the car . But the beer does n't help , and so the father , as he starts the car and heads for home , thinks about reaching into the backseat for another beer and in thinking about the beer misses the turn to his house , which means he 'll have to go somewhat out of his way . Matty immediately notices that the father has missed the turn , of course , and of course he ca n't just shut up about it , of course he has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as if the father has intentionally chosen a different , longer way to get home and Matty is about to get all over his case about it . <p> This pretty much tears it , as far as the father is concerned . So he turns to Matty , and says in his deepest , spookiest voice : " Matty , I 'm not your real father . " Then , like your best movie villain , the father bugs his eyes out at Matty and cackles . <p> The father is kidding ! Of course he 's kidding , even though Matty is so strange and so difficult that the father sometimes thinks Matty is not his real son , sometimes fantasizes that Matty is not his real son . Even so , the father is obviously just kidding around . At worst , he 's just trying to get a rise out of Matty ; at worst , he 's trying to rattle him a little . <p> But Matty is not rattled , or does n't appear to be . He smiles a little nervously at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . <p> So the father feels like he has no choice but to continue the joke . He stops the car right in the middle of the street , gets out of the car , walks over to the passenger side , opens the door , and says : " Your real father told me to drop you off here . He 'll pick you up in a few minutes . " It just comes to the father , like that . <p> But does Matty finally get the joke and laugh ? Or does he break down and start crying , like most normal kids would ? No . He gets out of the car and stands there next to the father by the side of the road . <p> So again , the father feels he has no choice , because to say " I 'm just kidding " now would mean he was backing down to his son , and as any good father knows , you must stand your ground with your children . So the father says , " OK , then . Good luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drives home . <p> When he gets back home , the father tells his wife that Matty ran into a few of his friends and that he 'll be home in time for dinner . Does he feel bad about what he 's done ? Of course he does , a little , but he also feels that he 's taught his son a valuable lesson of some sort , and that the boy is smart enough to figure out the joke and also smart enough to walk home once he figures it out . <p> So the father relaxes a little-and he certainly deserves a little R &; R at this point , considering the kind of day and life he 's had-and by the time Matty finds his way home , the father has drunk six beers and is much calmer than he was and is feeling generous toward Matty and is genuinely happy to see him . <p> " Welcome home , " the father says . " Dinner 's about ready . " <p> The son does n't say anything , he 's obviously a little put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six beers and if he were n't so relaxed , he might have noticed that the son looks a little crazy around the eyes . But the father does n't notice . He follows the son into the kitchen , where the mother and the baby are waiting and dinner is on the table , and the father is feeling good , having his family around him like this , and still feels that way , even when he sees Matty holding a serrated carving knife against his throat , because Matty has often played this game where he holds himself hostage and walks around a house with an imaginary knife held to his neck saying , " Do n't make a move , " and so the father figures that this is just a more advanced version of the game . <p> It 's not a game , but how is the father to know this ? He 's as surprised as anyone else when Matty drags the knife across his throat . First , there is the cut , and then there are little drops of blood gathering and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood really starts to gush out of the wound and Matty starts to cry and gasp and shake a little bit , and his hands start to flutter like birds and Matty says to the father , " Dad , I 've hurt myself . I 'm sorry . What do we do now ? " And then he hands the knife to the father . <p> What is Matty thinking about what he 's done ? It is difficult to say : maybe he really wants to die ; or maybe he 's thinking that this all will teach the father a lesson and , if he survives , the family will be better off because of it . What are the mother and baby thinking ? Also difficult to say : they , strangely , are looking at the father as if it were he who cut Matty 's throat and not Matty himself . And what is the father thinking ? He 's thinking how unpredictable and scary and strange kids are , and that you have to be vigilant in protecting them , especially from themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on out he will keep his sons safe , no matter what , and that he will always look at things as they might , from their point of view . <p>
