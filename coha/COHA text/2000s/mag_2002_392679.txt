" I 'm the only young , single woman in my office , and I just naturally fell into a more casual rapport with my male boss than any of the men were able to , " she says . " I can get away with teasing him , but he 'd never put up with that from the guys . So whenever there 's an out-of  --  office project that he needs help with , he brings me along-he 'd rather go with someone he gets a kick out of than someone he has to act totally straight with . " Even if you 're not the only chick in your row of cubes , you can follow Lisa 's example . " Figure out what 's of interest to your boss and your coworkers , and make a point of regularly asking them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coauthor of In the Company of Women .

The whole meeting takes on a teasing vibe where we try to one-up one another 's clever comments . Once we have that energy humming , we get even more pumped and we stay on our toes while we spin out ideas . " guys get it Put your average man near an easygoing , friendly woman and he instantly turns into a big flirt . " Especially for younger men , that playful , coy dynamic is comfortable and familiar , " says Lennahan . " They know how to respond to women in that context .

" In my technology finn , there are tons of guys who get a little bit tonguetied around women , " she explains . " They do n't know how formal to be , and it used to make working in groups awkward and unproductive . But when I just relax and treat them like I would treat guys in a social situation-laughing , not being afraid to talk about my personal life a bit-the whole communication gap disappears . We fall naturally into a state where we can tell one another up front what the project goals and needs are . " sugar lips win people over instantly There 's no doubt that spreading sweetness is the secret to getting what you want , as Jody , 23 , discovered .

" He 'd been there longer , so he told me later that as far as he was concerned , I 'd be doing all the expenses because he had seniority . Instead of throwing a hissy fit , I told him I figured she wanted us to share the responsibility because she knew she could count on him always to do them perfectly while I learned from his very skilled example , It was true , and he was so flattered that he happily did not only his share of the load but some of mine ! " It 's a simple case of coyly buttering up your target-complimenting his skills before asking for help on a task , letting him know he 's the only one who could possibly save your day , or making it clear that a favor to you will pay off for him in the form of a rah-rah E-mail to his supervisor or the promise to help him out the next time he needs a hand . " If you make people feel good , your power of persuasion multiplies-they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor or get a job done quickly , " points out Lennahan .
