CONVICTION In fifty-nine days , if the State of California had its way , the man inside the Plexiglas booth would die by lethal injection . Teresa Peralta Paget paused to study him , the guard quiet at her side . Her new client stood with his back to them . He was bulky , the blue prison shirt covering his broad back like an oversize bolt of cloth . A picture of enthrallment , he gazed through the high window of the exterior wall at the San Francisco Bay , its water glistening in the afternoon sun . She was reluctant to distract him ; the man 's sole glimpses of the world outside , Terri knew , occurred when his lawyers came to see him . The others were out of it now ; the last set of lawyers had withdrawn after their latest defeat . The final desperate efforts to keep Rennell Price alivewhat she thought of as the ritual death spasms ordained by the legal systemhad fallen to Teresa Paget . This was their first meeting : but for his solitude , she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huddled with their lawyers in the two rows of Plexiglas cubicles . It resembled , Terri thought , an exhibit of the damnedsooner or later , in months , or more likely years , the impersonal , inexorable grinding of the machinery of death would consume each one in turn . But perhaps not , Terri promised herself , this one . At least not until she had burnt herself down to the nerve ends , sleep-deprived from the effort to save him . To her new client , she supposed , Terri might appear a mere morsel for the machine , insufficient even to slow its gears . She was smallbarely five feet fourand slight , with olive skin and a sculpted face , which herhusband stubbornly insisted was beautiful : high cheekbones ; a delicate chin ; a ridged nose too pronounced for her liking ; straight black hair , which , in Terri 's mind , she shared with several million other Latinas far more striking than she . There was little about her to suggest the steeliness an inmate might hope for in his lawyer except , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she smiled never quite lost their keenness , or their watchfulness . This wariness was Terri 's birthright , the reflex of a child schooled by the volatile chemistry which transformed her father 's drinking to bru- tality , and reinforced by the miserable first marriage which Terri , who had no better model , had chosen as the solution to her pregnancy with Elena . Her personal life was different now . As if to compensate for this good fortune , she had turned her career down a path more arduous than most lawyers could endure : at thirty-nine , she had spent the last seven years representing death row inmates , a specialty which virtually guaranteed the opposition and , quite frequently , the outright hostility of judges , prosecutors , witnesses , cops , governors , most relatives of the victim , and by design , the legal system itselfnot to mention , often , her own clients . Now that stress and anxiety no longer waited for her at home , Terri sometimes thought , she had sought them out . What would be most stressful about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convicted , though it was far more odious than most especially , given certain facts , to Terri herself . Nor was it whatever version of humanity this man turned out to be : her death row clients had run the gamut from peaceable through schizophrenic to barking mad . But this client represented the rarest and most draining kind of all : for fifteen years , through a trial court conviction in 1987 , then a chain of defeats in the California Supreme Court , the Federal District Court , the Federal Court of Appeals , and the United States Supreme Court , Rennell Price had claimed his innocence of the crime for which the state meant to kill him . No court had considered this claim worthy of belief or even , in the last five of these proceedings , a hearing . As far as the State was concerned , its sole remaining task should be to dispatch three psychiatrists to advise the Governor 's office , within twenty days of the appointed date of execution , whether her client was sane enough to die : one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the State 's insistence that the condemned fully appreciate that lethal injection would , in fact , be lethal . She nodded to the guard . He rapped sharply on the Plexiglas . With a twitch of his shoulders , as though startled , the black man inside the cage turned to face them . His eyes were expressionless ; for him , Terri thought , the highlight of her visita view of the baywas already over . With a resignation born of fifteen years of meeting lawyers in these booths , he backed toward the door and , hands held behind his back , thrust them through an open slot . The guard clapped on his handcuffs , closing them with a metallic click . Then Rennell Price , shackled , stepped away from the door . The guard opened it , admitting Terri . The door shut , and Rennell stood over her . As he backed to the slot again , waiting for the guard to uncuff his outthrust hands , Terri had an involuntary spurt of fear , the reflex of a small woman confined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve jurors , done a terrible thing to someone much smaller than she . She held out her hand . " I 'm Terri Paget , " she told him . " Your new lawyer . " His expression was somewhere between sullen and indifferentshe might as well have pronounced herself an emissary from Pluto . But after a moment , he looked up at her and said in a monotone , " My name Rennell . " She searched his eyes for hope or , at least , some instinct to trust . She saw none . " Why do n't we sit , " Terri said . " Get acquainted a little . " With a fractional shrug , her client turned , slid out the orange plastic chair on the far side of a laminated wood table , and sat , staring past Terri . Settling across from him , Terri saw the inmates in the next two cages huddled with their lawyers , lips moving without sound . Rennell 's face , Terri decided , was more than inexpressiveit had no lines , as if no emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been only eighteen when convicted , now was barely thirty-three , and that the fifteen years in between had been , were this man lucky , mostly solitary , and unrelentingly the same . But not even Terri 's presencea novelty , at leastcaused the line of his full mouth to soften , or his wide brown eyes to acknowledge her . Terri tried to wait him out . Yet the broad plane of his face remained so impassive that he seemed not so much to look through her as to deny her presence . It was hard to know the reasons . But one of the hallmarks of an adult abused as a child , Terri reflected , was an emotional numbing to the point of dissociationa willful process of going blank , of withdrawing mentally from this earth . Jurors often thought such men indifferent to the crimes their prosecutors described so vividly ; in the case of this crime , that could hardly have helped Rennell Price . " I 've taken over your case , " Terri explained . " Your lawyers at Kenyon and Walker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This drew no reaction . Mentally , Terri cursed her predecessors for their absence , the ultimate act of cowardice and desertionleaving her to build a relationship with a sullen stranger , the better to save his life , or prepare him to die . Then , to her surprise , he asked , " You know Payton ? " " Your brother ? No , I do n't . " Terri tried to animate her voice with curiosity . " How 's he doing ? " " Fixing to die . They 're going to kill him . Before me . " Oddly , Terri thought , this last detail about Payton seemed to carry more dread than his own fate . " How do you know ? " she inquired . He slumped forward on the table , not answering . " I ca n't be there , " he said dully . " Warden told me that . " Struck by the answer , Terri chose to ignore its unresponsiveness . " What else did she tell you ? " " That I can pick five people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , granted the condemned by the grace of the State of California . But from what Terri knew , it would be hard to find five people , outside the victim 's family , who gave enough of a damn to watch . Rennell Price 's death , if it came , would be a very private affair . " You do n't have to worry about that yet . " Pausing , Terri looked hard into his eyes . " We 'll have a lot of helpmy husband , Chris , who 's a terrific lawyer , and a team of investigators to look into your case . You 'll meet them all soon . We 'll be doing everything we can to save your life . " For almost half that life , he had heard thisTerri could see that much in his face . And each time , she already suspected , whoever said it had been lying . Slowly , his eyelids dropped . " I did n't do that little girl , " he said . " Payton did n't do her . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you know about Payton ? " Terri asked . " He told me . " What to make of that , she wondered . As either a reason to believe his brother or a statement of truth , it was implausible to the point of pitiful , and she could not divine if this man knew it . " Who do you think did ' her , Rennell ? " He gave a silent shrug of the shoulders , suggesting an absence of knowledge or , perhaps , a massive indifference . " The day she died , " Terri persisted , " can you remember where you were ? " " I do n't remember nothing . " As an answer , it was at least as credible as the alibi the defense had offered at the brothers ' trial . But one or the other could not be true , **25;60;TOOLONG neither was . Terri simply nodded . There was little else to ask until she combed the record , little purpose to her visit beyond starting to persuade Rennell Priceagainst the odds , given his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to see you every few days , " she assured him . " Is there anything you need ? " Rennell gazed at the table . " A TV , " he said at last . " Mine 's been broke for a long time now . " " Before it broke , what did you like to watch ? " " Superheroes . Especially Hawkman . Monday through Friday at four o'clock . " She could not tell if this commercial announcement was a statement of fact or suggested an unexpected gift for irony . Whatever the case , given the size of his cell and the cubic footage limitations on his possessions , a new TV would not bankrupt the Paget family . And fifty-nine days of Hawkman was not too much to askthough it was not easy for Terri to imagine the waning existence which would be measured out , hour by hour , in images on the Cartoon Network . " I 'll get you a new one , " she promised . Her client did not answer . Maybe , Terri thought , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did not look up . Only as the guard approached did Rennell Price speak again , his voice quiet but insistent . " I did n't do that little girl , " he told his lawyer . Two " To look at his reactions , " Teresa Paget told her hus- band and stepson , " most people would wonder if there 's a human being inside . But I began to wonder if he 's retarded . " Chris 's mouth formed a smile . " Or maybe just antisocial . In the Attorney General 's Office , that means just smart enough to feel no remorse . " The three of themTerri , Chris , and Carlosat on the deck of the Pagets ' Victorian home in the Pacific Heights section of San Francisco , three tall glasses resting on the table in front of them . In the foreground of their sweeping view , Victorians and Edwardians and red-brick Georgians crowded the hill , which descended to the Italianate homes of the Marina District . Beyond that , the bay was still crowded with boats in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sails swelling with a steady wind , which on the Pagets ' deck calmed to a fitful breeze . Though the panorama relieved Terri 's sense of claustrophobia , so intense in the Plexiglas booth , it heightened her consciousness of the surreal gap between Rennell 's existence and her own , intensified by the familiar visages to either side of her . At fifty-five , Christopher Paget remained trim and fit , the first streaks of silver barely visible in his copper hair , the clean angles of his face as yet unsoftened by age . Wealthy by inheritance , Chris carried an air of sophistication and detachment which never obscured , at least for Terri , his devotion to their reconfigured family : her thirteen-year-old daughter , Elena ; their seven-year-old son , Kit ; and , as always , their newest legal associateChris 's son Carlo , fresh from Yale Law School at the age of twenty-five . If anything , Carlo appeared more blessed than Chris . His mother , of Italian descent , had been a beauty , and Carlo had dark good looks which Terri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's many graces was that he seemed unaware of this . Unlike Chris , who superficially did not appear so , Carlo was idealistic , a sweet and loving soulall of which , Terri knew , had everything to do with Chris himself . That was part of what had caused Terri to fall in love with Chris . So here she was , the daughter of a struggling Hispanic family , sitting in a beautiful house in a beautiful city with two men who , by all appearances , had been showered with God 's favors since the moment they were born . It was not quite true , of course . Chris 's parents were unloving and alcoholic socialites whose wasted lives had ended in a car wreck . Carlo had been the by-product of an affair , the miserable and unloved son of a single mother who despised Chris too much to let him raise Carlountil the moment , fearful that the stunted seven-year-old child would become a damaged adult , Chris had given her no choice . It was this sense of life 's underside that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as he could , what it was like for Terri to grow up in a household where her father raped and brutalized her mother , indifferent to what their daughter saw or felt . That this experience had led herwith whatever emotional crosscurrentsto comprehend the lives which so often created death row inmates , and to feel that representing them was recompense for her own escape , was something that Chris still strove to understand ; that their law firm would subsidize her efforts , and that Chris would help , was a given . Which was why Carlopreserved in his idealism , Chris wryly remarked , by an absence of student loanshad chosen to join them . They drank iced tea ; though it was close to the Pagets ' accustomed cocktail hour , the conversation was too purposeful for that . " Still , " Chris ventured , " it 's a strange crime . " Only after a quick glance at Terri did Carlo turn to him , and she was acutely aware of the sensitivity toward her that , for a moment , delayed his question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would involve both brothers . It 's a matter of shameif you put a nine-year-old boy on the fifty-yard line at Notre Dame stadium , and packed the seats with pedophile priests , none of them would move . Child molesters tend to act alone . " This remark , with its echoes from her daughter Elena 's past , reminded Terri that walling herself off from the nature of Rennell Price 's alleged crime might be far more difficult than she had made herself believe . Then Chris reached across the table and touched her hand . Quietly , he said , " You do n't have to take this case , you know . " Pensive , Terri curled her fingers in his . " The Habeas Corpus Resource Center is jammed , and they 're out of volunteers . So it 's me or no one . " She faced Carlo . " About child molesters , " she told him baldly , " your dad 's right . Elena could tell you that . But Rennell Price still claims he 's innocent . That 's where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , as Terri had known it would . After another glance at his father , Carlo nodded . " So , " she continued , " we have to look at the facts as if no one ever has before . Review the police reports , the physical evidence , the witness statements , the trial transcript . Track down the key witnessescould they have been mistaken , we 'll want to know , or have had a motive to lie ? Both happen more often than you 'd think . " " What about the cops ? " " If they 're willing . Same with the prosecutor and Rennell 's trial lawyerwe 'll want to know why they made the choices they did . That will be far more touchy for defense counsel . " Carlo raised his eyebrows in inquiry . " Because we 'll second-guess him ? " " More than that , " Chris told him . " We have to prove that Rennell Price 's trial lawyer was so incompetent that his client was denied the effective assistance of counsel granted by the Sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some courts have ruled that even sleeping through your client 's trial is not enough to qualify . Damned few lawyers will admit they were worse than that . " " If we can prove Rennell Price is innocent , why should it matter ? " Terri suppressed a rueful smile : framed against the panoply of sailboats , his crew-neck burgundy sweater carelessly draped over his shoulders , Carlo still seemed innocent himself . But so had she been . " Later on , " she promised , " I 'll induct you into the wonderland of death penalty jurisprudence . For now , take my word that the State of California can claim that even compelling new proof of this guy 's innocence does n't bar his executionat least , taken alone . If the trial was fair , then they 'll say his execution is constitutional . Even if the verdict may well have been wrong . " " How can innocence not matter ? " " Because that 's the lawyou 'll find out soon enough . Rennell Price was convicted of an awful crime , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's become an overdue debt to the victim 's parents , and the State of California is determined to collect on their behalf . " Saying this reminded Terri of how solitary Rennell wasand of why she must distance herself , as much as possible , from the fact that the victim had suffered a death which caused Terri to cringe with guilt at what her own daughter still was forced to live with . " So we 'd better hope he is retarded , " Chris remarked to Carlo . " That 's the good news , if there is any . While you were holed up cramming for the bar exam , the Supreme Court decided in Atkins v. Virginia that we no longer execute the mentally retarded . The trick , if Terri 's right , is proving that she 's right with respect to Rennell Price . Otherwise , " Chris added sardonically , " or so the argument goes , we 'll be flooded with claims of retardation filed by crafty middle-aged inmates who suddenly ca n't tie their own shoes . " That means we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how he got that wayhis parents , relatives , brother , friends , home , neighborhood , educational and medical histories , mental profile . Everything that ever happened to him , an entire social history in fifty-nine days . " The task was so daunting that Carlo , feigning a careless shrug , simply inquired , " So where do we start ? " Restless , Terri stood . " By going to the office , " she told him with faux good cheer . " Right now . We 'll start by reading reams of paper , then tracking down the cops . " Now Carlo looked genuinely startled . " What if I have a date ? " Chris laughed aloud . " Ask her to come to your place late , " he suggested helpfully , " and hope that she 'll stay over . " Abruptly , his eyes grew serious and , in his wife 's appraisal , a little sad . " Until you save Rennell Price , or the State of California kills him , life as you know it is over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . I know that from living with Terri . "
