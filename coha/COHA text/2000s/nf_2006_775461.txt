The Supermarket : Prime Real Estate // A visit to a large supermarket can be a daunting experience : so many aisles , so many brands and varieties , so many prices to keep track of and labels to read , so many choices to make . No wonder . To repeat : An astonishing 320,000 edible products are for sale in the United States , and any large supermarket might display as many as 40,000 of them . You are supposed to feel daunted-bewildered by all the choices and forced to wander through the aisles in search of the items you came to buy . The big companies that own most supermarkets want you to do as much searching as you can tolerate . It is no coincidence that one supermarket is laid out much like another : breathtaking amounts of research have gone into designing these places . There are precise reasons why milk is at the back of the store and the center aisles are so long . You are forced to go past thousands of other products on your way to get what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of offering " choice . " Perhaps , but they do everything possible to make the choice theirs , not yours . Supermarkets are not social service agencies providing food for the hungry . Their job is to sell food , and more of it . From their perspective , it is your problem if what you buy makes you eat more food than you need , and more of the wrong kinds of foods in particular . // And supermarket retailers know more than you could possibly imagine about how to push your " buy " buttons Half a century ago , Vance Packard revealed their secrets in his book The Hidden Persuaders . His most shocking revelation ? Corporations were hiring social scientists to study unconscious human emotions , not for the good of humanity but to help companies manipulate people into buying products . Packard 's chapter on supermarket shopping , " Babes in Consumerland , " is as good a guide as anything that has been written since to methods for getting you-and your children-to " reach out , hypnotically ... and grab boxes of cookies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or interests you . " // More recent research on consumer behavior not only confirms his observations but continues to be awe-inspiring in its meticulous attention to detail . Your local library has entire textbooks and academic journals devoted to investigations of consumer behavior and ways to use the results of that research to sell products . Researchers are constantly interviewing shoppers and listening carefully to what they are told . Because of scanners , supermarkets can now track your purchases and compare what you tell researchers to what you actually buy . If you belong to a supermarket discount " shoppers club , " the store gains your loyalty but gets to track your personal buying habits in exchange . This research tells food retailers how to lay out the stores , where to put specific products , how to position products on shelves , and how to set prices and advertise products . At the supermarket , you exercise freedom of choice and personal responsibility every time you put an item in your shopping cart , but massive efforts have gone into making it more convenient and desirable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As basic marketing textbooks explain , the object of the game is to " maximize sales and profit consistent with customer convenience . " Translated , this means that supermarkets want to expose you to the largest possible number of items that you can stand to see , without annoying you so much that you run screaming from the store . This strategy , is based on research proving that " the rate of exposure is directly related to the rate of sale of merchandise . " In other words , the more you see , the more you buy . Supermarkets dearly wish they could expose you to every single item they carry , every time you shop . Terrific as that might be for your walking regimen , you are unlikely to endure having to trek through interminable aisles to find the few items you came in for-and retailers know it . This conflict creates a serious dilemma for the stores . They have to figure out how to get you to walk up and down those aisles for as long as possible , hut not so long that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores make some compromises-but as few as possible . Overall , supermarket design follows fundamental roles , all of them based firmly on extensive research . // * Place the highest-selling food departments in the parts of the store that get the greatest flow of traffic-the periphery . Perishables-meat , produce , dairy , and frozen foods-generate the most sales , so put them against the back and side walls . // * Use the aisle nearest the entrance for items that sell especially well on impulse or look or smell enticing-produce , flowers , or freshly baked bread , for example . These must be the first things customers see in front or immediately to the left or right ( the direction , according to researchers , does n't matter ) . // * Use displays at the ends of aisles for high-profit , heavily advertised items likely to be bought on impulse . // * Place high-profit , center-aisle food items sixty inches above the floor where they are easily seen by adults , with or without eyeglasses. // * Devote as much shelf space as possible to brands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupy , the better they sell . // * Place store brands immediately to the right of those high-traffic items ( people read from left to right ) , so that the name brands attract shoppers to the store brands too . // * Avoid using " islands . " These make people bump into each other and want to move on . Keep the traffic moving , but slowly . // * Do not create gaps in the aisles that allow customers to cross over to the next one unless the aisles are so long that shoppers complain . If shoppers can escape mid-aisle , they will miss seeing half the products along that route . // Additional principles , equally well researched , guide every other aspect of supermarket design : product selection , placement on shelves , and display . The guiding principle of supermarket layout is the same : products seen most sell best . Think of the supermarket as a particularly intense real estate market in which every product competes fiercely against every other for precious space . Because you can see products most easily at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the checkout counters , these areas are prime real estate . Which products get the prime space ? The obvious answer : the ones most profitable for the store . // But store profitability is not simply a matter of the price charged for a product compared to its costs . Stores also collect revenue by " renting " real estate to the companies whose products they sell . Product placement depends on a system of " incentives " that sometimes sound suspiciously like bribes . Food companies pay supermarkets " slotting fees " for the shelf space they occupy . The rates are highest for premium , high-traffic space , such as the shelves near cash registers . Supermarkets demand and get additional sources of revenue from food companies in " trade allowances , " guarantees that companies will buy local advertising for the products for which they pay slotting fees . The local advertising , of course , helps to make sure that products in prime real estate sell quickly . // This unsavory system puts retail food stores in firm control of the marketplace . They make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which products you buy . This system goes beyond a simple matter of supply and demand . The stores create demand by putting some products where you can not miss them . These are often " junk " foods full of cheap , shelf-stable ingredients like hydrogenated oils and corn sweeteners , made and promoted by giant food companies that can afford slotting fees , trade allowances , and advertising . This is why entire aisles of prime supermarket real estate are devoted to soft drinks , salty snacks , and sweetened breakfast cereals , and why you can always find candy next to cash registers . Any new product that comes into a store must come with guaranteed advertising , coupons , discounts , slotting fees , and other such incentives . // Slotting fees emerged in the 1980s as a way for stores to cover the added costs of dealing with new products : shelving , tracking inventory , and removing products that do not sell . But the system is so corrupt and so secret that Congress held hearings about it in 1999 . The industry people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they wore hoods and used gadgets to prevent voice recognition . The General Accounting Office , the congressional watchdog agency ( now called the Government Accountability Office ) , was asked to do its own investigation but got nowhere because the retail food industry refused to cooperate . // The defense of the current system by both the retailers who demand the fees and the companies that agree to pay them comes at a high cost-out of your pocket . You pay for this system in at least three ways : higher prices at the supermarket ; taxes that in part compensate for business tax deductions that food companies are allowed to take for slotting fees and advertising ; and the costs of treating illnesses that might result from consuming more profitable but less healthful food products . // In 20% , supermarkets sold more than $35o billion worth of food in the United States , but this level of sales does not stop them from complaining about low after-tax profit margins-just 1 to 3 percent of sales . One percent of $350 billion is $3.5 billion , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little to count . In any case , corporations have to grow to stay viable , so corporate pressures on supermarkets to increase sales are unrelenting . The best way to expand sales , say researchers , is to increase the size of the selling area and the number of items offered . Supermarkets do both . In the last decade , mergers and acquisitions have turned the top-ranking supermarkets-Kroger , Albertsons , and Safeway-into companies with annual sales of $56 , $40 , and $36 billion , respectively . Small chains , like Whole Foods and Wegmans , have sales in the range of just $4 billion a year . // But sales brought in by these small chains are peanuts compared to those of the store that now dominates the entire retail food marketplace : Wal-Mart . Wal-Mart sold $284 billion worth of goods in 2005 . Groceries accounted for about one-quarter of that amount , but that meant $64 billion , and rising . Many food companies do a third of their business with this one retailer . Wal-Mart does not have to demand slotting fees . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has to offer rock-bottom prices . Low prices sound good for people without much money , but nutritionally , there 's a catch . Low prices encourage everyone to buy more food in bigger packages . If you buy more , you are quite likely to eat more . And if you eat more , you are more likely to gain weight and become less healthy . // Food retailers argue that if you eat too much it is your problem , not theirs . But they are in the business of encouraging you to buy more food , not less . Take the matter of package size and price . I often talk to business groups about such matters and at a program for food executives at Cornell University , I received a barrage of questions about where personal responsibility fits into this picture . One supermarket manager insisted that his store does not force customers to buy Pepsi in big bottles . He also offers Pepsi in 8-ounce cans . The sizes and prices are best shown in a Table . // In this store , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than half the cost of the equivalent volume in 8-ounce cans . Supermarket managers tell me that this kind of pricing is not the store 's problem . If you want smaller sizes , you should be willing to pay more for them . But if you care about how much you get for a price , you are likely to pick the larger sizes . And if you buy the larger sizes , you are likely to drink more Pepsi and take in more calories ; the 8-ounce cans of Pepsi contain 100 calories each , but the 2-liter bottle holds 800 calories . // Sodas of any size are cheap because they are mostly water and corn sweeteners-water is practically free , and your taxes pay to subsidize corn production . This makes the cost of the ingredients trivial compared to labor and packaging , so the larger sizes are more profitable to the : manufacturer and to the stores . The choice is yours , but anyone would have a hard time choosing a more expensive version of a product when a cheaper one is right there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold out for healthier choices in the supermarket system as it currently exists . // You could , of course , bring a shopping list , but good luck sticking to it . Research says that about 70 percent of shoppers bring lists into supermarkets , but only about 10 percent adhere to them . Even with a list , most shoppers pick up two additional items for every item on it . The additions are " in-store decisions , " or impulse buys . Stores directly ' appeal to your senses to distract you from working about lists . They hope you will : // * Listen to the background music . The slower the beat , the longer you will tarry. // * Search for the " loss leaders " ( the items you always need , like meat , coffee , or bananas , that are offered at or below their actual cost ) . The longer you search , the more products you will see . // * Go to the bakery , prepared foods , and deli sections ; the sights and good smells will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the samples that companies are giving away . If you like what you taste , you are likely to buy it . // * Put your kids in the play areas ; the longer they play there , the more time you have to walk those tempting aisles . // If you find yourself in a supermarket buying on impulse and not minding it a bit , you are behaving exactly the way store managers want you to . You will be buying the products they have worked long and hard to make most attractive and convenient for you-and most profitable for them . // But , you may ask , what about all those beautiful fruits and vegetables ? Are n't you supposed to eat more of them ? Is n't the produce section the one place in the supermarket where the store 's goal to sell more is exactly the same as the goals of healthy eating ? Perhaps , but nothing in a supermarket is that simple . Collect a shopping cart , turn right or left at the entrance to the store , and let 's take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fruits and Vegetables : The Price of Fresh // A couple of years ago I was spending some time in upstate New York and went to the Wegmans supermarket in Ithaca . I had read a Harvard Business School case stud ' about Wegmans , a chain of seventy or so stores in the northeast region known for its unusual attention to quality , responsiveness to customers ' concerns about health and social issues , and active commitment to " Making a Difference in Our Community . " Because Wegmans is family owned , privately held , and not traded on the stock market , the company has more flexibility than publicly traded chains to offer services that do not immediately increase sales or profits . // When you enter the Ithaca Wegmans , you find yourself in a huge produce section , larger than the size of a basketball court . You can easily imagine that you are in a farmers ' market in the south of France or in Italy ; the only things missing are the hot sun and the sellers at the individual stalls . You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spray misting the salad greens . It smells good in there . You want to sneak tastes of everything you see . And the variety is extraordinary . One late-spring day 1 counted nine kinds of melons , five kinds of sweet pepby the time I buy it , and it will be even less so by the time I actually get around to eating it . // But maintaining the cold chain is not the only factor that affects the quality of fruits and vegetables . Even " fresh " produce is often subjected to processing before it reaches a supermarket shelf . To allow them to endure transportation , bananas and tomatoes are picked while still green , then chilled , warmed , and treated with gases to make them ripen . Bagged vegetables and salads have been washed and cut , subjected to " modified-atmosphere packaging " which changes the proportions of oxygen and carbon dioxide to delay spoilage ) , and sometimes treated with preservatives . Those raunchy and convenient " baby " carrots are ordinary carrots which have been cut into small pieces and shaped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // The conclusion : fresh is relative . The Food and Drug Administration says " fresh " foods have to be raw , never frozen or heated , and with no added preservatives . But even " fresh " fruits and vegetables are often subjected to processing before they reach a supermarket shelf . In supermarket terms , " fresh " refers to foods that spoil faster than others . It does not mean that foods were picked earlier that day , or even that week . //
