Chapter One New Year 's Eve 1999 , New York City Jeff Across the dance floor , some guy 's squirting Windex in his mouth . " Now I 've seen everything , " Henry says , all eyes and attitude . I just shake my head . " Believe me , Henry . You have not seen everything . " For here on the dance floor , nothing quite makes sense in the way it does in the world beyond . Here the ludicrous becomes the sublime . Dress in spandex and sequins and funny little hats . Ingest substances not intended for human consumption . Stick your tongue down the throat of a beautiful stranger . Take off your pants and dance in your underwear . That 's just the way things are . " Still , " Henry 's sputtering , shaking his head , " the things some people will do for a fucking high . I mean , Windex- " " Henry . " I place my palms against his sweaty chest and press my face close to his . Eyes to eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance floor . " It 's my rule , and he knows it , even if he conveniently forgets it whenever he want to start gabbing . Henry 's one of the chatty types . You know the kind I mean . The ones who insist on telling you , right in the middle of an awesome Rosabel club anthem remix , all about their new job or the size of the penis on their last trick or-worst of all-how tonight 's DJ just really sucks : " Can you believe how he 's mixing in all this trancey stuff with all this high-energy disco diva blah blah blah blah blah . " Dancer ! We 're here to dance ! That 's why I come , anyway : to escape , to forget , to get swallowed up by a moist cocoon of four hundred men with the music spinning me higher and higher until it 's taken control , slipping past my defenses like the fingers of a stranger trespassing beneath the waistband of my underwear . That happens , too . One more example of the way things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry says . " He saw me looking . " I roll my eyes . " Who ? " " The Windex queen ! " A few feet away , to the giddy disgust of the boys around him , the tall blond guy is pumping the bright-blue liquid down his throat . But his eyes have locked onto Henry 's , and he 's now sidling our way , his lanky body easily angling around the huddles of boyflesh . " Jeff , you 've got ta hide me ! " Henry yelps . I just laugh . " Did n't I teach you to fight your own battles , buddy ? " " How you boys doin ' tonight ? " the Windex queen purrs , holding aloft his bottle like a prize . " Wanta get really twisted ? " I give the guy the once-over . A dyed blond , skinny and shapeless , with tiny little buds for nipples , one of which is pierced with a small gold ring . " Thanks , " I tell him , " but we 're as twisted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fun , " he says , pouting , moving on to his next victims . Henry leans into me and breathes a sigh of relief . " Do you think that really is Windex ? " " Henry , " I remind him , " no talking on the dance floor . " Okay . So maybe you think I 'm coming across a little overweening here . I do n't mean to be . Really , I do n't . Oh , I 'm sure in the course of this you 're going to hear people say that I 'm self-absorbed , arrogant , selfish . They said it last time , they 'll say it again . But it 's just that I 've come here to dance , to close out the rest of the world for a night , to forget what I want so much to forget . Is that so wrong ? So much to ask ? I have no patience for dance floor vaudeville . And maybe tonight I 'm a little more impatient that usual . You see , it 's getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Forgive me if I use my voice again , Jeff , " Henry says , drawing close . " But are you starting to think that Lloyd is n't coming ? " " He 's still got time , " I insist . Henry snorts . " And you 're still convinced he 's going to tell you he wants to move back in with you ? " Here 's something you need to know about Henry : he 's my best friend and I love him and he 's terrific and all that , but he can be a total nag . I think somewhere down deep , Henry would like us to be more than just friends , and the idea of my ex-lover and me moving back in together probably unnerves him a little bit . So I just smile . " Well , we 'll just have to wait and see , " I suggest sweetly , " wo n't we , Henry ? " He just smirks and goes silent . Finally . We both fall into the music . It 's awesome tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sending warm shivers thoughout my body . I reach over and run my hands down Henry 's torso , tweaking his nipples as I pass . He opens his eyes . " Just because you 're rolling , Jeff O'Brien , is no excuse to hit on your sister . " I pull in close . " You know you want me , " I tease . Henry pushes me away . " What I want , " he insists , " is to be in Miami . Brent is in Miami , and you can be sure he 'll tell us all about it . " Okay , a few more notes on Henry . I created this monster . Yes , I admit it . I take full responsibility for what he 's become . Henry Weiner was once a good boy who never had more than a couple of Heinekens at happy hour , whose idea of a big Saturday night out was watching retro Cyndi Lauper videos at Luxor with a couple of pals until midnight . He was one of those nameless , faceless guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cocktails , watching the world pass them by . He was a 120-pound insurance-company geek on the fast track to corporate paralysis when I met him , enticing him to take off his shirt and step into the limelight . I 'll never forget the look of sheer wonderment on his face as he slipped in between Brent Whitehead and me on the dance floor . Now Henry weighs in at 185 , has a hard-won six-pack of abs and a star-burst tattoo around his navel . Now it 's very important to Henry to keep pace with the other boys-especially Brent , circuit boy extraordinaire , who makes sure he 's at every important party around the nation and whose primary goal in life is to get a photo of his sweaty torso into the pages of Circuit Noize magazine . I look over at Henry with mock sympathy . " Now , now , buddy , we were just in Miami last month for the White Party . Let 's not become complete stereotypes , shall we ? " He sniffs . " All I know is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butts off on Tenth Avenue tonight . " " Hey , you 're the one that nixed the cab . " He shakes his finger at me . Literally . Like some old schoolmarm . " And well I did . After paying a hundred bucks to get in here tonight-not to mention what I had to fork over for the X-I was n't paying out any more cash than I had to . " I lace my fingers behind Henry 's back and pull him close , crotch to crotch . " So what happened to it ? " I purr into his ear . " Ecstasy is supposed to give you a love for all mankind . " Henry smiles . Our faces are close enough that I can smell the Altoid in his mouth . In moments like these I can tell he wants to kiss me . Or me to kiss him . I can feel my dick swell against him despite myself . " I 'm just not independently wealthy like you , " Henry needles . " And besides , it 's the millennium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was when the twentieth century turned over into the twenty-first-and here I am , in New York of all places , where I could be any time , any year , any century . " He pouts . " And Victor Calderone is spinning in Miami . You love Victor Calderone , Jeff . " " Junior 's doing a fine job here . " Henry smirks . " So long as the power does n't shut off at midnight . " " Oh , do n't start with the Y2K stuff . " I hold my hands up . " How many gallons of water did you stockpile again ? " He ignores me . " At least in Miami we would n't freeze without power . " " Henry . " I narrow my eyes at him . " Read my lips . Ix-nay on the dance floor talk . " I grab him around the waist just as Junior mixes in " Unspeakable Joy " by Kim English . Henry smiles nastily . " You know , maybe Lloyd got stuck in the thirteenth century and ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be snide , Henry . " Okay , time for a little more background . Lloyd-the guy I 'm waiting for-the guy with whom I 've spent the last eleven years of my life in a crazy back-and-forth pas de deux-had a first stop to make this evening before winding up here at Twilo . It was a past-life regression gathering at some lady 's house on the Upper West Side . Now , I can make fun of Lloyd 's New Agey-ness , but I will not tolerate others doing the same thing . Not even Henry . " I 'm not being- " Henry suddenly stops . " Oh , God , Jeff . He 's coming back . " Two things at once : on my right , I spot the Windex queen approaching again , a tall flurry of arms with a mischievous gleam in his eyes , and on my left , beyond the perimeter of the dance floor , I catch a sudden flash of goatee and one well-rounded shoulder . Lloyd . He 's quickly obscured again by the throng of manflesh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , " the Windex queen is saying . " Just one little baby squirt ? " I watch as the freak show pumps a dollop of the blue stuff into his mouth and swallows it , licking his lips . Henry makes a face in horror . " Girl , " I say , tapping a finger against his sticky , sinewy chest , " if you 're drinking Windex , then I 'm a straight boy from Jersey City . " At that moment , the crowd parts , not unlike the Red Sea , in fact , and I spot him again . Lloyd . Our eyes connect . He waves when he sees me . God , how beautiful he looks . I quickly slip around the Windex queen to push into the throng of flesh . " What 's the matter ? " the guy asks , mock-innocently . " Was it something I did ? " Henry frowns . " It 's not you , " he says , raising his voice so I can hear . " It 's his ex-lover , with whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can fade out together behind the end credits and live happily ever after . " So let Henry be snide and sarcastic . That 's what sisters do best , is n't it ? Well , screw him . I 'm not sure I still believe in happy ever-afters , given everything that 's happened in the last five years , but right now , spotting Lloyd across the dance floor , all that matters is that he 's here . Lloyd Even before I see him fully , I know it 's Jeff . That 's just the way it is with us . We have this uncanny way of finding each other , of connecting across great distances . Even during the time we were apart , if I would have a dream about him one night , he was sure to call the next morning . Do n't laugh . I believe in such things as psychic connections , soul mates , partners with whom you travel from life to life . How else to explain Jeff and me ? It 's not as if we 're much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sweat and stink and drugs . So call it whatever you want , but there is something bigger than the two of us that keeps us together . There has to be . " Hey ! " Jeff pushes his way out of the snake pit of the dance floor . I ca n't help laughing at the image . " You look like one of those devil kids emerging from the cornfield . " Jeff 's eyes widen and he raises his arms like a monster . " The Cheeldren of the Corn , " he intones ominously , then breaks into a broad grin . We both laugh and fall into each other 's arms . It 's one of our favorite bad movies , watched on a rainy day in Provincetown , a pan of brownies rapidly disappearing between us . We kiss . Lots of tongue and lips . I determine pretty quickly that Jeff is on X. His torso is sticky and wet . I 'm shiftless , too , having adhered to the unwritten but widely observed policy of shirt removal moments after checking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been here for a while , slipping and sliding across countless boys on the dance floor-I have yet to break into a sweat . " You look great , Cat , " I tell him . And he does-better all the time , it seems . Jeff 's always been good-looking-dark hair , classic features-but now he 's bigger , broader , more cut . He 's spent a lot of time at the gym over the past several years . And why not ? He 's had nothing else to do and has n't needed to worry about money the way he used to . Besides , I think the gym , like his clubbing , is a way for him to escape . To forget . Jeff spends a lot of energy forgetting . " You , too , Dog , " he tells me . " You look great , too . " We kiss again . Our old nicknames flow easily . In fact , everything 's been surprisingly easy these past few months , almost impossibly so . We stand there pec to pec , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waists . We 're the same height , so we 're able to stare into each other 's eyes until we both , at the same time , let loose with a grin . That 's been happening a lot : whenever we look into each other 's eyes for any length of time , we just ca n't hold back the smile . " I 'm really glad you got here before midnight , " Jeff says softly , holding my face in his hands . I wink at him . " With twenty minutes to spare , too . " " I never doubted you for an instant . " Okay , so he probably did , but it 's sweet of him to pretend . He kisses me passionately for a moment , then pulls back to gaze into my eyes again . I smile wryly . " How much X did you do , Jeff ? " " Just one bump . " He gets edgy , a little defensive-not what I want or what I intended . " You said you trusted me . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I know , Jeff . I just worry that a little X- " " Can lead to more ? Please , Lloyd . " He kisses me . " I 'm okay . Just expressive . You said I needed to be more expressive . " A point of order here : Jeff was once very expressive about things , without the need of any drug . I remember , when we lived together we 'd have fights about the laundry , in which he 'd kick the basket of clothes all the way down the stairs . Once , fed up with bill collectors , he tossed a ceramic dog his grandmother had given him across the room , where it shattered into a dozen pieces and left him heartbroken . I then painstakingly glued it back together for him as best I could . Jeff never used drugs in those days . The emotion was real , heartfelt . The old Jeff used to cry over episodes of Laverne and Shirley-whenever Laverne would realize what a schmuck she 'd been and how happy she really was living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the two of them would start singing " High Hopes " as the camera panned up and out through the window . Jeff would be over there blubbering on the couch , and I was never quite sure if I wanted to laugh or cry along with him . Then things happened . All the stuff he 's been trying so hard to forget . He started doing drugs-and the nasty ones : crystal and GHB-and he shut down , reined in all those emotions . I hardly knew him . The Jeff I 'd lived with for six years had n't been afraid to let his feelings show . He might not have always known what they meant , but he let them flow . Continues ...
