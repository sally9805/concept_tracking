AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY Headnote Milstein Family Hall of Ocean Life Reopens May 17 Headnote Melanie Stiassny is Axelrod Research Curator of Ichthyology in the Division of Vertebrate Zoology and a lead curator of the renovation of the Milstein Family Hall of Ocean Life . She spoke with us about the oceans , the new hall , and the blue whale . // Q : You 've said that we know more about the dark side of the moon than we know about the ocean . A : Which is sadly true . As terrestrial creatures , we tend to think of life on our planet as being essentially life on land . It could n't be further from the truth . A little over 70 percent of the Earth 's surface is covered in water . We 've seen the blue marble from outer space . It 's blue because there 's so much water on Earth . And 362 million square kilometers of that is marine  --  the world ocean . Yet perhaps as little as 1 percent of the ocean floor has actually been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " final frontier , " the last truly wild place on our planet . It 's a place that is not only extraordinary in its dimensions and all of the implications of its size but it 's also the place that was the cradle of life on Earth . But instead of everything leaving the cradle , in fact , most things have stayed in the ocean . Most of the life on Earth is still living in the ocean . Q : I think most people are surprised by the amount and diversity of life under the water . A : It 's phenomenal . Estimates vary and , believe it or not , we 're not even able to say how many species exist on the planet . But probably about 80 to 90 percent of all life on Earth is found in the ocean . And it 's not just the quantity or " biomass " - the actual amount of living material-it 's also the diversity , the number of different kinds of living things . The people visiting the new Hall of Ocean Life are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never heard of , they 've never even imagined . And yet these organisms all work together to create something incredibly diverse and fundamentally important for life on the entire planet . Q : When people leave the hall , what do you want them to think ? A : Well , that 's really difficult because there are so many different things . But I want people to walk away with an understanding of how remarkably superlative the oceans really are . Not just in terms of sheer size and beauty , but also in their ecological complexity and the tremendous biological wealth they contain . Perhaps above all , I want them to understand how absolutely critical ocean health is to the health of all life on Earth . The oceans are a series of interconnected ecosystems that can unravel very , very , quickly . So I also want visitors to the hall to be empowered in a sense , to have an idea of how their behavior as individuals can impact the oceans but how it can also help to save them . Q : Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I hope people are going to be very happy when they come back to the hall , This is one of the most beloved halls in the museum-for good reason . We want people to experience all the wonder they felt in the older version , but to be amazed by the new . We did n't want to change it beyond recognition , but we did want to tell a much richer story . By giving the oceans a proper introduction and a real explanation as to what they are , where they came from , how long they 've been around , what 's living there , and that it all functions as a complex whole , I think that 's going to be an eye-opener for many visitors . It 's also going to be tremendously beautiful . I think we steer a very nice path between being absolutely state-of-the  --  art , but at the same time , keeping this kind of majesty and splendor of the old style of exhibit . I really hope people appreciate how much thought actually went into that because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Q : What can you tell us about the centerpiece of the hall , the blue whale model ? A : As you know , the blue whale is a kind of " jewel in the crown " for this institution . An incredible animal , the largest that ever lived . Ours is a female ( they are slightly larger than males ) . When she was installed in 1969 , we knew so little about blue whales that we actually got some of the anatomical details wrong . She had been modeled from a specimen about to be butchered and decomposition had already begun to distort her frame . We 've now corrected that , and we 've metaphorically released her back into her habitat-the open ocean . Now , when you come into the hall and see this beautiful animal you 'll not only learn about blue whales , and whales in general but also about work being done in whale conservation throughout the globe . And you 're going to learn about the habitat that the whale lives in . In short , we have really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean into their ecological context . So that now the blue whale in a sense becomes the ambassador to the open ocean-the largest habitat on our planet .
