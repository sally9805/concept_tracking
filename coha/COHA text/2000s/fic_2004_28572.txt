Chapter One One , Two , Three , Etcetera ... As I was going to St. Ives , I met a man with seven wives , Each wife had seven sacks , Each sack had seven cats , Each cat had seven kits : Kits , cats , sacks , and wives , How many were there going to St. Ives ? - Anonymous TO BEGIN WITH ONCE UPON A TIME would be , perhaps , a tad facetious . Rather to simply begin at the beginning , or at least as nearly as possible to that part of the beginning where it becomes interesting . Picture England during the Regency . Such a time , such a varied generation . War , civil upheaval , opulence , indulgence , genius and cruelty . Great literature , great inventions , great deeds , great injustices . The English Regency has all of that . Those who live there , happily , also manage to squeeze in a little silliness , a little fun . There are a few , in particular , who might be mentioned now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drummond , Marquis of Westham , a gentleman who has been blessed with fine good looks , great wealth and high intelligence ... and cursed with a quick temper that , five years earlier , ended in a duel that nearly cost another man his life . Shameful . And Morgan was ashamed , devastated by his actions . What was the matter with him ? he asked himself . Did an insult to his latest light-o ' - love ( what was her name again ? ) really necessitate a trip to Lincolns Inn Fields and dueling foils drawn at dawn ? Was he that mad ? Had n't he learned anything through his father 's death at the hands of another duelist when he , Morgan , had been only a toddler in leading strings ? What had that fight been about anyway ? If Morgan could n't recall the story , and he was the son of " Mad Harry , " obviously the reason had been insufficient to the result - his mother a widow , his father 's body moldering in the family mausoleum at Westham . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his epitaph to read : " Mad Morgan , laid low by his own wretched temper . " So the chastened and repentant Morgan swore to shun his former hey-go-mad ways and had fled London , retreating to his estate in Westham , to lick his own wounds and examine his life . And he had been exceedingly boring . He had drunk deep and long , then thought , hard and long , and finally decided that he could control his temper . He worked diligently during those five years of self-imposed isolation , remaking himself less in his father 's image and more in what he believed to be his own . He did not , however , metamorphose into Mellow Morgan , as he never quite overcame his inborn arrogance , his penchant for sarcasm , or his most definite disdain for fools . Alas , ho-hum , he was still boring . But at last Morgan , having just passed his thirtieth birthday , and admittedly weary of his reclusive life , believes himself equipped to rejoin civilization once more . Sure of himself , confident in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silliness of a London Season , because yes , indeed , it is time Morgan marries and sets up his nursery , begets himself an heir to carry on the line . He has thought long and hard ( and boringly ) about this as well . What he needs is a complacent wife , a calm and never ruffled wife , a woman of breeding and some wit , but with a temper as sweet as a May morning - for the sake of their unborn children , naturally . So off he goes , to London . NEXT UP , WE HAVE ONE Miss Emma Clifford who , as it happens , is also on her way to London . Dear Emma . Was there ever a more beautiful female ? Poor Emma . Was there ever a more beleaguered female ? Emma Clifford is the older child and keeper of the Clifford family , which explains the beleaguered portion of her description . Emma 's mother is lovable , but a bit of a twit . Her brother is a complete loss . Her irascible grandmother is forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all constantly in need of funds . The Cliffords do have one hope . Actually , they harbor quite a few hopes . Emma , however , has just one . She is not a silly girl ; she knows she is quite beautiful . And , in London , beautiful is often the key that opens the door to an advantageous marriage . In other words , a good marriage equaled solvency for the entire family . Ah , a financially comfortable existence ; always considered A Good Thing To Have , and eternally prized as a cure-all to any woe by Those Who Do n't Have . Although her grandmother keeps telling Emma that , ideally , marriage should n't have anything to do with lining one 's pocket at the expense of being stuck with a belching , scratching buffoon who probably ingests cabbage for breakfast . Her grandmother 's advice to one side , the determined Emma has sold her mother 's diamonds , hocked the family portraits , and traded the services of a fairly good stud horse for the use of an ancient traveling coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Continues ... )
