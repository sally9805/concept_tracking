The Burglar on the Prowl Chapter One " The man , " said my friend Marty Gilmartin , " is an absolute . . . a complete . . . an utter and total . . . " He held out his hands , shook his head , and sighed . " Words fail me . " " Apparently , " I agreed . " Nouns , anyway . Adjectives seem to be supporting you well enough , but nouns  --  " " Help me out , Bernard , " he said . " Who is more qualified to supply le mot juste ? Words , after all , are your mtier . " " They are ? " " Books are your stock-in-trade , " he said , " and what is a book ? Paper and ink and cloth and glue , to be sure , but if a book were nothing more than those mundane components , no one would want to own more than one of them . No , it 's the words that constitute a book , sixty or eighty or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand , or even three . " I 'd read Grub Street recently , and was thinking about the less-than-eminent Victorians George Gissing wrote about , forced by their publishers to grind out interminable three-volume novels for a body of readers who clearly had far too much time on their hands . " That 's more words than I require , " Marty said . " Just one , Bernie , to sum up "  --  he glanced around the room , lowered his voice  --  " no , to impale Crandall Rountree Mapes like an insect upon a pin . " " An insect , " I suggested . " Far too mild . " " A worm , a rat . " He was shaking his head , so I shifted gears and exited the animal kingdom . " A bounder ? " " That 's closer , Bernie . By God , he is a bounder , but he 's much worse than that . " " A cad . " " Better , but  --  " I frowned , trying to conjure up a thesaurus spread open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A rotter ? " " Oh , that comes close , " he said . " We 'll settle for that if we ca n't do any better . It 's just archaic enough , is n't it ? And it 's better than bounder or cad because it 's clearly not a temporary condition . The corruption is permanent , the man is putrid to the core . " He picked up his glass , breathed in the bouquet of aged cognac . " Rotter comes very close indeed to conveying just what a thoroughgoing shitheel goes by the name of Crandall Rountree Mapes . " I started to say something , but he held up a hand to stop me . " Bernie , " he said , wide-eyed with wonder , " did you hear what I just said ? " " Shitheel . " " Precisely . That 's perfect , the quintessential summation of the man . And where do you suppose the word came from ? Not its derivation , that would seem clear enough , but how did it get into our conversation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . " " I did , and I could n't guess the last time I uttered it . " He beamed . " I must have been inspired , " he said , and rewarded himself with a small sip of the venerable brandy . I could n't think of anything I 'd done to merit a reward , but I had a sip from my own glass just the same . It filled the mouth like liquid gold , slid down the gullet like honey , and warmed every cell of the body even as it exalted the spirit . I was n't going to drive or operate machinery , so what the hell . I had another sip . We were in the dining room of The Pretenders , a private club on Gramercy Park every bit as venerable as the cognac . The membership ran to actors and writers , men in or on the fringes of the arts , but there was a membership category called Patron of the Theater , and it was through that door that Martin Gilmartin had entered . " We need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the main criterion for membership at this point is the possession of a pulse and a checkbook , though to look around you , you might suspect that some of our members have neither . Would you like to become a member , Bernie ? Did you ever see Cats ? If you loved it , you can join as a Patron of the Theater . If you hated it , you can come in as a Critic . " I 'd passed up the chance to join , figuring they might draw the line at prospective members with criminal records . But I rarely turned down an invitation to join Marty there for lunch . The food was passable , the drink first-rate , and the service impeccable , but the half-mile walk from Barnegat Books led me past eight or ten restaurants that could say the same . What they could n't provide was the rich atmosphere of the nineteenth-century mansion that housed The Pretenders , and the aura of history and tradition that permeated the place . And then there was Marty 's good company , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an older gentleman , and he 's what fellows who read Esquire want to be when they grow up  --  tall and slender , with a year-round tan and a full head of hair the color of old silver . He 's always well groomed and freshly barbered , his mustache trimmed , his attire quietly elegant but never foppish . While enjoying a comfortable retirement , he keeps busy managing his investments and dipping a toe in the water when an attractive business venture comes his way . And , of course , he 's a patron of the theater . As such he goes to quite a few shows , both on and off Broadway , and occasionally invests a few dollars in a production that strikes his fancy . More to the point , his theatrical patronage has consisted in large part of underwriting the careers of a succession of theatrical ingnues , some of whom have actually demonstrated a certain modicum of talent . Dramatic talent , that is to say . Their talent in another more private realm is something upon which only Marty could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretion personified . We met , I would have to say , in highly unlikely circumstances ...
