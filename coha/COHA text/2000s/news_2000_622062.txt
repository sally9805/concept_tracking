<p> Patent fights are an everyday occurrence in biotech , but a new dispute between Chiron Corp . and Genentech Inc. has several elements that rise above the ordinary . <p> First off , we have two of the Bay Area 's biotech giants arguing over which of them deserves credit  --  and royalties  --  for the scientific advance behind the breast cancer treatment Herceptin . <p> Herceptin is a Genentech product that belongs to a new class of therapeutic compounds called monoclonal antibodies . Monoclonals latch on to specific targets , called antigens , on the surface of cancer cells . Thus monoclonals are the therapeutic equivalent of guided missiles , which seek out and destroy sick cells . <p> Relying on a patent application first filed in 1984 , Chiron Corp . sued Genentech Inc. earlier this month in federal court in Sacramento . According to Chiron , scientists at Cetus Corp. , a defunct firm that is now part of Chiron , first discovered and patented the principle of using monoclonals to target breast cancer antigens . <p> Chiron says Cetus scientists patented this breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cetus filed its original application in 1984 , it was not until April that Chiron finally won a patent . <p> Now Chiron thinks this patent entitles it to a share of the $188 million Genentech earned last year on Herceptin , plus a slice of future sales . The suit does n't mention figures but Chiron patent attorney Robert Blackburn said royalties of 10 percent are common in similar cases . <p> Genentech patent attorney Sean Johnston rejected Chiron 's claims on several grounds . To begin , Genentech will argue that in the early 1980s , many scientists were hunting for monoclonal antibodies to target breast cancer antigens . Johnston said Cetus did not make the discovery in question , and in any event , its approach turned out to be a dead end . <p> " Cetus and Chiron scientists were not the first to identify the . . . antigen on breast cancer cells , " he said . <p> Whatever early contributions Cetus made , the fact remains that Genentech spent several hundred million dollars to put Herceptin through years of animal and human experiments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little or nothing . As Blackburn put it , Chiron " can not say whether or not Cetus pursued the technology " in question . <p> But under U.S. law , that does n't matter , Blackburn said . Even if an inventor fails to commercialize a patented discovery , no one else can use it without paying a royalty . Some European countries do have use-it-or-lose-it provisions in their patent law . The United States does not . <p> " I do n't want to take anything away from Genentech , " Blackburn said . " They did the clinical trials that pushed this monoclonal through the regulatory process . But they did n't discover the antigen . " <p> Genentech will attack Chiron 's claims on several fronts . In addition to asserting that Cetus did n't make the discovery first , Genentech will question the convoluted history of the Cetus patent . The application was filed in January 1984 but went through several revisions before it was issued on April 25 . <p> " Here we have a patent granted almost 16 years after the fact , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own on Herceptin . All were filed in 1988 and granted around 1997 . But Genentech 's patents could be trumped if the court upholds the earlier Cetus application . <p> Blackburn said that over the years , Chiron and Genentech have discussed whether Genentech should take out a license from Chiron . After the patent was issued in April , Chiron made another attempt to negotiate a royalty . When Genentech refused to pay , Chiron filed suit . <p> Now the two sides are in the infant stages of a legal dispute that could take years to resolve . Blackburn said Chiron is encouraged by a 1998 federal appellate decision in a similar case . <p> In that case , the courts ruled that CellPro Inc. infringed on a patent granted to Johns Hopkins University . Both had developed systems for sorting bone marrow cells for use in transplants . Both relied on antigens to do sorting . Even though CellPro got its product to market first and had its own patents on the process , the courts ruled that Johns Hopkins had been first to patent the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The legal precedent is pretty clear from the CellPro case , " Blackburn said . <p> But the same case holds out a warning to Chiron . According to Dale Hoscheit , a Washington , D.C. , patent attorney who worked on the CellPro matter , the case was originally tried before a jury which decided in CellPro 's favor , in part because CellPro took the process to market . <p> " Juries can have good insights but they can be emotionally swayed , " Hoscheit said . <p> The judge ultimately set aside that jury verdict and ruled in favor of Johns Hopkins . An appellate court upheld the finding . <p> But even if Chiron prevails in its suit , there 's no way to avoid giving the impression that it is now banking on its lawyers to do what its scientists could n't , which is to create a money-making anti-cancer therapy . <p> WHO YA GON NA CALL ? Genetic advances are pouring out of laboratories faster than doctors and patients can comprehend . Many ailments can now be diagnosed by genetic tests , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . And if a test should disclose that a patient has a rare genetic disease , that only raises more questions about where to find information , treatment and support . <p> GeneSage is a San Francisco health care startup that hopes to help health professionals navigate the new genetic terrain . GeneSage has created a database on where to find genetic tests and assembled a group of genetic counselors to provide consultations on complex cases . <p> The business is based on the solid proposition that most questions about genetic disease will be fielded by general practitioners whose training may not have equipped them to answer these new questions . <p> " Most genetic medicine will and should be practiced by primary care physicians , " said GeneSage co-founder and genetic medicine specialist , Paul Billings . <p> While the premise seems sound , only time will tell whether the price is right . GeneSage plans to sell subscriptions to medical groups . An annual fee of roughly $120 per physician will entitle all the doctors in the group to access the database , via the Internet , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpret the results . GeneSage will also arrange for follow-up consultations . <p> GeneSage wo n't say which , if any , medical groups or health plans have bought into the service .

The Coalition of Artists and Life Forms is a Bay Area arts group that views biotechnology as both a subject and a medium for creative expression . After a year or so of informal meetings , CALF will hold its first public event tomorrow night , " Art in the Age of Biotechnological Reproduction . " <p> On hand to discuss the aesthetics of cloning will be Lou Hawthorne , who is running a $2.5 million effort to clone a dog ; Marilyn Donahue , an artist who advocates DNA copyrighting as a form of protest against gene patents ; Mark Brest Van Kempen , an ecological artist who has created a small wetland that he can tow on a trailer behind his car ; and Sharon Grace , an interdisciplinary artist and a founder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dale Hoyt will moderate the discussion . The event begins at 8 p.m. at the Lab , an alternative art gallery at 2948 16th St. in San Francisco . Admission will be on a sliding scale from $5 to $8 , a small price to stand at the cutting edge of culture and bioscience . <p> For more information , e-mail dalehoyt@hotmail.com . <p> Look for BioScope every Monday in the Business section .
