Section : 2006 Investment Guide Taxes When Congress is in session , it 's best to arrange your financial affairs very defensively . Herewith , some specifics . <p> FROM THE START OF 2001 THROUGH THIS PAST September Congress made ( by tax publisher CCH 's count ) 1,971 changes to the U.S. tax code  --  roughly 3 for each day it was in session . And all this tinkering produced what ? The need for still more changes , of course . <p> Under current law millions are menaced by the Alternative Minimum Tax , the estate tax dies in 2010 and is reincarnated in 2011 , and President George W. Bush 's big income tax cuts all disappear by 2011 . Meanwhile , a host of other breaks expire each year . Typically , however , such breaks are resuscitated at the last minute . Among those expiring at the end of 2005 : deductions for state and local sales taxes and college tuition , and measures that keep the number of families paying AMT from quintupling . <p> To add to the uncertainty , President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan did during his second term 20 years ago . In November a Bush-appointed reform advisory panel proposed repealing the AMT , limiting the home mortgage interest tax break , wiping out any deduction for state and local taxes , and revamping retirement , education and health care savings accounts . <p> " Everything is in play right now . It 's the most difficult time to plan since 1986 , " laments Thomas Ochsenschlager , vice president for tax of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants . <p> Only this time it could take longer for the fog to lift . " We 're going to be in a period of uncertainty for the foreseeable future , " opines Mark A. Weinberger , President Bush 's first tax policy chief , now at Ernst &; Young . He speculates it might be 2008 before a " trifecta " of issues  --  the imminent expiration of the Bush tax cuts , retirement of the baby boomers and explosion of the AMT  --  forces Congress to make the tough choices . <p> In the meantime here 's what a rational taxpayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could end up with a slightly lower top rate and almost no deductions , as the reform panel proposed . But given projected budget deficits ( which Bush essentially told his panel to ignore ) , both the overall tax burden and marginal rates are more likely to go up . Republican leaders indeed want to make the Bush tax cuts permanent . But as of mid-November the law was this : On Jan. 1 , 2009 the long-term capital gains and dividend rates , which both now top out at 15% , revert to their pre-2003 tax treatment  --  which means 20% for gains and 35% for dividends . On Jan. 1 , 2011 the top 35% levy on ordinary income ( salary , interest and business income ) climbs back up to 39.6% . <p> A Roth Individual Retirement Account makes a dandy hedge against higher rates  --  particularly for young folks likely to graduate to higher brackets  --  even if rates do n't rise . You deposit aftertax dollars into a Roth , and all withdrawals after five years and age 591/2 are tax free . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 401(k) , and every dollar that comes out is taxed as ordinary income , at the rates then in effect . <p> In 2006 a childless couple claiming only the standard deduction pays a marginal tax rate of only 15% on earnings of up to $78,200 and 25% on up to $140,600 . Reasonable savings strategy for taxpayers in those brackets : Put enough pretax money into your 401(k)s to grab any employer match and then contribute the maximum $4,000 each ( $4,500 if you 're 50 or older ) to Roth IRAs before adding more funds to your 401(k)s . If you need cash before retirement , you withdraw the original Roth IRA contributions without tax or penalty . <p> Couples earning more than $160,000 do n't qualify for Roth IRAs . But beginning in 2006 companies can offer a Roth option within 401(k)s , where no income ceiling applies . As of October 17% of employers surveyed by the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America intended to offer a Roth option ; another 41% were on the fence . <p> At the high end of the earnings spectrum , PricewaterhouseCoopers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensation plans . Once a coveted perk , these plans allow a big chunk of an exec 's salary to be held by the company and grow tax deferred . The downside , notes Kent , is that any investment gains , along with the deferred pay , are taxed as ordinary income at whatever ( maybe higher ) rates are in effect at withdrawal . Further diminishing the plans ' appeal : In 2004 Congress changed the rules to make it much more difficult for an executive to withdraw his deferred stash if his company gets in trouble . <p> Take the income now , he says , pay your taxes , invest what 's left , and your gains will be taxed at only 15% . <p> Wait a minute , does n't that 15% rate expire soon ? Short of a Republican electoral disaster , some preferential rate for capital gains seems likely to survive . But there 's no guarantee it will stay as low as 15% , making now a good time to take gains . <p> GET USED TO THE AMT <p> If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't look for relief soon . The AMT requires a taxpayer to figure his bill two different ways and pay the higher tab . It was adopted in 1969 to make sure millionaires with oil wells and exotic shelters paid at least some tax . But today AMT victims typically have incomes of $200,000 to $500,000 and are being punished for such exotic deductions ( disallowed in AMT ) as state and local taxes and kids . If the about-to-expire " patch " is n't renewed , an additional 17 million folks , including three-fourths of those with income of $100,000 to $200,000 , will end up paying AMT . <p> If you 're in AMT territory , try to hold down items it disallows , such as investment expenses , unreimbursed business expenses and interest on a home-equity line not used for house improvements . ( For example , hedge funds ' fat managers ' fees usually trickle through to your return as an investment expense ; mutual fund fees do n't . ) Watch out for " private activity " muni bonds for things like sports stadiums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving , you ca n't avoid a high state and local tax bill , but you can sometimes control the AMT damage by cleverly timing tax payments . ( You 'll need software or a tax pro to run those numbers . ) <p> And if you 're stretching your budget to buy a house in a high-cost/high-tax area , be sure to consider the AMT . Silicon Valley tax pro Claudia Hill recently warned her own daughter and son-in-law not to include any federal deduction for the prospective $15,000 real estate tax bill in their calculations of whether they could swing a house . <p> The President 's reform panel made clear how hard it would be to fix the AMT without busting the budget . If Congress decides to simply repeal the AMT , without touching current deductions , it would take an 11% across-the-board rate increase to make up the lost revenues  --  boosting the top 35% tax rate to 39% and the 25% rate to 28% . Instead the panel proposed eliminating the dual tax system by , in effect , making the regular tax more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes . <p> WATCH YOUR BACK <p> With Congress on the prowl for revenues to pay for further tax-cut extensions , any break that can be cast as a " loophole " is fair game . Last year , to pay for corporate tax breaks , Congress cracked down on inflated deductions for donating clunker cars to charity . In a bill recently approved by the Senate Finance Committee to extend expiring provisions , Congress would clamp down on still other donation abuses and broaden the reach of the kiddie tax , which taps a child 's unearned income over $1,600 ( for 2005 ) at a parent 's higher rate . The tax now ends the year a kid hits 14 . This little-noticed proposal would raise $2 billion over ten years by upping that age to 18 . <p> Realtors , builders and a lot of politicians have vociferously attacked the Bush reform panel 's proposal to sharply limit the mortgage tax break to a 15% credit on mortgages no larger than $412,000 . This led some analysts to pronounce any mortgage-interest cutback dead . Yet some limits suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deduction for second homes or for the $100,000 in home-equity borrowing for nonhouse purposes . The latter already is disallowed in the AMT . The panel 's report , observes Clint Stretch , director of tax policy for Deloitte Tax , provides " a shopping list of things that could rationally be done . " He warns that while the tax reform in 1986 was revenue neutral , the next big " reform " could mean a tax increase . <p> DO N'T WRITE OBITS FOR THE DEATH TAX <p> Chances that Republicans can permanently repeal the estate tax are fading . Under current law the amount each individual can pass to heirs free of estate taxes rises to $2 million in 2006 and $3.5 million in 2009 . The tax disappears in 2010 and reappears with a paltry $1 million exemption and top 55% rate in 2011 . Over that whole period the amount of the exemption you can use to make gifts during your life remains stuck at $1 million . <p> What 's likely is a compromise  --  say a permanent $3 million to $5 million exemption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In an office pool , CCH Principal Federal Tax Analyst Mark Luscombe has picked 2009 as the year of a deal . In the meantime ? Do n't make any taxable gifts above that $1 million , since the gift tax rate will likely drop as part of a deal , says Kent . Be sure , however , to use your annual gift exclusions . You can give $11,000 per year ( $12,000 as of 2006 ) to any and every person you want , without counting it against your lifetime exemption . You can also pay anyone 's educational or medical expenses directly without worrying about the gift tax . <p> Similarly , unless your assets are more than $10 million ( per couple ) , do n't set up a new family limited partnership , says Phoenix CPA Edward Zollars . Recent court decisions show these widely marketed devices can reduce estate taxes , but only if you really give up control of assets in the partnership and respect all the formalities . That means hefty legal and accounting fees . " The care and feeding will run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Zollars says . <p> None of this means , however , that you should put planning on hold . Instead , make sure your estate plan is flexible enough to deal with constant changes . The standard plan for an upper- middle-class couple is designed to preserve both spouses ' exemptions , without leaving the surviving spouse strapped for funds . At the death of the first spouse the exempt amount goes into a " bypass trust " for the kids and the rest goes directly to the surviving spouse . ( Spouses can leave each other an unlimited amount , free of estate tax . ) The bypass trust can pay income  --  and , if needed , principal  --  to the surviving spouse . But it is n't part of the taxable estate of the survivor . <p> Problem : As the exemption moves higher , that bypass trust could end up holding all of an upper-middle-class couple 's assets and be a pain for the survivor . One solution , says New York estate attorney Bruce Steiner , is to give the surviving spouse lots of control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cotrustee ; giving the survivor the power to replace the other ( nonfamily ) trustee ; and even allowing the survivor to add and remove beneficiaries of the trust . <p> That wo n't work for every family . Second marriages or family strains may require a different approach . And state estate taxes must be considered , particularly since Congress has axed a federal credit for state estate levies . A third of the states still tax estates ; some allow a less generous exemption than do the feds . <p> In 2006 putting the full $2 million federal exemption into a bypass trust for the kids will cost a family in New Jersey , where the exemption is only $675,000 , almost $100,000 in state estate tax  --  a painful and possibly unnecessary hit if $2 million is all a couple has . Steiner suggests two bypass trusts : one funded for $675,000 and the second an empty " disclaimer " trust . The surviving spouse is left everything over $675,000 directly , yet can elect to " disclaim " some assets into the second trust , basing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winds are blowing . Now You see It . <p> Expiring tax breaks are part of a budge accounting game that has allowed Congress to hand out tax goodies .
