How would you like to make a photographic print using solar energy ? You wo n't need a camera or film . All you will need are photosensitive paper , rocks or leaves , water , and the sun ! What is photosensitive paper ? Photosensitive paper reacts to light the same way photographic film does . The paper , like camera film , contains a chemical called silver halite , which responds to light by turning the paper dark blue . The amount of shading that occurs depends on the thickness of the objects placed on top of the paper . Follow these directions to make your solar prints . Materials : Photosensitive paper ( available at education and specialty craft stores ) Nature materials ( leaves , rocks , pine cones , etc . ) Pan of water Piece of cardboard Scissors Watch or clock Towel Directions : 1 . Start your project in a shaded area outside . Remember that the photosensitive paper is sensitive to light . 2 . Fill a shallow pan with tap water , and place it in the shade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Place the paper , with the light blue side facing up , on a piece of cardboard that is slightly larger than the photosensitive paper . 5 . Arrange the nature materials on top of the paper , covering one-half to three-fourths of the surface . 6 . Place the paper in bright sunlight for two to three minutes . 7 . Take the paper into the shade . Remove the nature materials and the cardboard . The leaves and rocks should leave imprints on the paper . 8 . Place the paper into the pan of water for two minutes . The imprints will gradually fade . 9 . Remove the paper from the water , and place it on a towelcovered surface . As it dries , watch the images appear . You have just made your first solar print . You can make your print into a bookmark or greeting card by gluing the finished print to a piece of cardboard or colored paper . Use your imagination and be creative ! // <p>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
