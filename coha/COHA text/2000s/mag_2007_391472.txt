The 12 remarkable people on the following pages range from a major winner to a Mayo Clinic Ph.D . to an F-16 pilot . They have one thing in common : Their surprising , inspiring ideas are elevating the game , making it better for all who play it . These are the innovators of golf , in their own words . The Protector The Patriot The Maverick The Scientists The Samaritan The Drill Sergeant The Vocal Volunteer The Inventor The Legend The Curator The Visionary LET 'S FACE IT : GOLF IS A SELFISH PASTIME . WE WANT TO shave strokes off our handicap , fix our slice , find the perfect clubs for us . Yet the game is filled with people who are giving back  --  to others and to the sport . This month , Golf Magazine honors some of the forward thinkers who are ( or soon will be ) impacting the culture of golf , in ways great and small . These 12 innovators represent a cross section of the many exceptional minds who are working in creative ways to make golf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , we sent out a clarion call for nominees to the USGA , the PGA Tour , all 41 sections of the PGA of America , the National Golf Foundation , our Top 100 Teachers in America , and millions of Golf Magazine readers and Golf.com users . It was n't easy , but our editorial panel whittled hundreds of worthy candidates down to 50 finalists and then  --  after much discussion and debate  --  settled on these dozen names . It is our pleasure to honor them . The Protector PAUL RAMELA , 45 Offering children shelter in AIDS-ravaged Africa " Soweto , South Africa , is very poor . Most families live in shacks . The average salary is 2,500 rands $420 per month . So I let everyone play the Soweto Country Club , where I teach . The children need this place . Many are the heads of their households because AIDS takes their parents . Free greens fees mean more money for meat or porridge . If they 're here , they 're not out finding trouble . Africa has much trouble . AIDS is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub-Saharan Africa have AIDS , and 4 million children have died of the disease . Here , I teach them good habits about morality , etiquette and proper behavior . They focus on their studies . But a little betting is OK . The older players put two or three rands on each hole . Younger boys caddie for 20 rands . That can feed a family for a month ! We do n't have colleges or scholarships in South Africa , but some of these kids could play at American universities . My student Clifford Ndou is 22 and a scratch golfer . He wants to play the PGA Tour . He 's like all the kids here : He just needs a chance . " The Patriot DAN ROONEY , 34 Raising money for families of fallen soldiers " I 'm a captain in the Oklahoma Air National Guard and a Class A PGA pro . I love golf . You remember " Maverick " from Top Gun ? Well , my call sign is " Noonan . " I 've served two tours of duty in Iraq , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground forces . I go back next year . With almost 4,000 U.S. soldiers killed and nearly 30,000 wounded , there 's a need to help the families of the fallen . They 've lost fathers , mothers . My idea was very simple : Saturday , Sept. 1 , was Patriot Golf Day . More than 3,200 courses across America raised their greens fees that day by one dollar , with proceeds going to families . We raised more than $500,000 . My motivation for this was the same as flying an F-16 in combat : to help the team . It only costs a dollar , and we 'll do it again next year . I think of it as the largest hall pass ever , a built-in excuse to play . A half-million guys can say to their wives , " Sorry , honey . Ca n't mow the lawn today  --  my country needs me . ' ' " **26;2417;TOOLONG The Maverick MITCH VOGES , 58 Making the right ball for you a mere click away , at Golfballselector.com " I may be about to ruffle some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to say , " We have the longest , softest ball ! , ' but I 'm putting their claims to the test . Even before I gained prominence as a player , I was a gear junkie . Last year , my club-fitting company , Max Out Golf , decided to figure out how we could help the average player find the right ball for him without having to hit every one on the market . Now , you might say , " I 'm not good enough to know the difference between balls . ' Well , I say , " Are you good enough to ignore the difference ? ' Low handicappers can adjust to any ball , but higher handicappers have less control , which makes the ball choice vital . We spent nine months having robots and testers hit thousands of balls . More than 40 brands . We recorded how balls perform , then took this mountain of data and turned it into an interactive Web experience . The result is something that 's never existed before . You just fill out a 10-minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what brands work best for your game . And yeah , it took a lot of balls to do this laughs . " Golfballselector.com , annual subscription : $19.95 The Scientists CHARLES ADLER , 49 DEBBIE CREWS , 54 Ph.D.s seeking to develop a pill to cure the yips Adler , professor of neurology , Mayo Clinic " I 'm the lead researcher in this collaboration between the Mayo Clinic and Arizona State University . I believe we 're taking yips research to a new level . We 're looking at 48 golfers . Through the study of muscle movement and brainwaves , we 're trying to prove that the yips are , for some , neurological . For others , it 's psychological . For the first group , we think it 's similar to Parkinson 's , or writer 's cramp . If we confirm that theory , then for the group with a muscular problem , you could treat that . You could literally take a pill to fix the yips . " Crews , faculty research associate , kinesiology , Arizona State University " My heart goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy seven-putt from five feet ! He just went back and forth , hands twitching . Some people do n't know they have it . They say , " No , I do n't yip at all ! " Then they attempt 75 putts , and they visibly twitch on every single one , and they do n't know it . So the thought of being able to help these people  --  yeah , that 's a great feeling . " The Samaritan RON PILOT , 79 Keeping troubled kids on the course and off the streets " I 've had it pretty good in life , so 10 years ago I decided to do more to help the kids who are sent to the Glen Mills reform school near Philadelphia , where I 'm a board member . All the kids , who range from age 15 to 18 , are sent here by the courts for getting in trouble with the law . I put them in charge of the school 's golf course . They learn to run a pro shop , how to mow rough , rake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These are inner-city kids . Some have literally never stepped foot on a piece of grass before they get here . And they 're not bad kids ; they 've made bad decisions . Like one kid I 'll call " Mike . " When he was 16 , Mike had a job parking cars and decided to take a joy ride in a couple 's BMW  --  for two days . Boys will be boys ! Here , they learn structure , discipline . They get up at 4:30 a.m. , work the register , fold shirts and run $250,000 diesel mowers . The kids can stripe a fairway as good as anyone at Augusta . They take what they learn into the world . We 've had 400 kids from 27 states and placed 50 of them in paying jobs in the golf industry . Laughs No , Mike never did ride the mower . " Glenmillsgolf.com The Drill Sergeant JIM ESTES , 43 Giving disabled Iraq War veterans something to swing about " I played the Nationwide Tour , and I teach here as director of instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the thrill I get teaching war veterans is like nothing else . We do weekly clinics . I 've worked with more than 300 soldiers in three years . The greatest gift you can give is to sacrifice yourself for your country , so when I saw these kids come home with their heads split open , eyes blown out , I felt a call . These guys have gone through real trauma , and golf is like therapy , an outlet . Dave Klatt , an army sergeant , had shrapnel in both arms and wrists . He could n't cock his wrists . He starts hitting 20-yard shots . Then he had a breakthrough and hit a barrage of 200-yard drives , and ran up and down the range , screaming , " Boo-yah ! Watch this ! " LaughsAnother soldier named Dave Cook has a prosthetic right leg . He was a 12-handicap before Iraq . Now he 's an 8 . His swing is more balanced . He says to me , " If I 'd known I 'd improve this much , I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golfsalute.org The Vocal Volunteer CLYDE LUTHER , 78 Teaching Tiger wannabes how to play by the Rules " I 've been a volunteer Rules marshal for almost 40 years . Let 's see , that 's 111 USGA championships , one Masters , 20 U.S. Opens , who knows how many junior events . An innovator ? I do n't know . Some people say there would n't be a Junior Amateur if it was n't for people like me . That 's flattering . I think everyone should do more to help golf . I do it because I love the game , and enjoy educating young people . After all , life is all about the people you meet . Tiger is a friend . Known him since he was 12 . In a tournament , he 'll walk right by everyone else , then see me and give me a big hug . That means a lot . He has a great sense of humor . At the ' ' 98 U.S. Open at Congressional , he almost shanked one into the rough , then walks by me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I play this stupid game . I ought a take up stamp collecting . ' I 've taught a lot of kids about etiquette and the Rules . I remember this 12-year-old . I saw him pick up his ball in the fairway and drop it . I came over to ask why he dropped  --  I figured he had an issue with a sprinkler head . He says , " No , it was n't that . My ball was in a divot . I do n't have to hit it from there , do I ? ' ' " The Inventor TIMOTHY WINEY , 41 Crafting a " revolutionary " putter for a British Open champion " I do n't work for a big club company . I 'm just a guy in his basement who found a better way to make a putter . I 've studied how to make violins , instruments that give you the kind of instant feedback through sound and vibration not possible with traditional putters . Your putter should be your instrument , not just a stick with a weight on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brass fixture halfway up the shaft . Simply put , that tells your hands where they are in relation to the putterhead , and by doing so tricks your neuromuscular system into thinking the putter is a foot long , and more controllable . I call it the Torpedo , since you " sink " more putts . It opens the lines of communication between your hands and the putterhead . Testers report an almost clairvoyant ability to " feel " the difference between , say , a 40- and 41-footer . It 's like hearing in stereo instead of through a cup-and-string . Padraig Harrington used my shaft at the 2007 Wachovia when he had just 24 putts in the first round . Then he used it to win the Irish Open and called it " revolutionary . " He switched shafts at the British , but I like to think that with the Torpedo , he would n't have even needed the playoff to win . " Torpedogolf.com The Legend GREG NORMAN , 52 Making golf greener , one design at a time " This January , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for giving back to the game . For one , I feel that golf should be more compatible with the environment . Courses elevate property value and create jobs as well as provide green spaces , filter air , and create a wildlife habitat . Doonbeg , in Ireland , was built with shovels , not bulldozers . We moved just 26,000 cubic yards of soil and protected a microscopic snail species . In addition to that , my tournament , the Merrill Lynch Shootout , has raised more than $10 million for CureSearch National Childhood Cancer Foundation . So I 'm proud to be mentioned with Old Tom . If we played each other ? Well , I 'd have the edge , because of my fashion sense . I 'd wear something from my Greg Norman Collection , which is comfortable and stylish . How can you make a full turn wearing a double-breasted three-piece wool suit ? " The Curator RAN MORRISSETT , 44 Keeping course-design debate alive ( and lively ) in cyberspace " I think of GolfClubAtlas.com as a museum . Architecture is an art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web site gives like-minded people a place to discuss and debate these works , to keep the discussion happening . People on the site are regular guys who want to protect great courses and preserve classic architecture . The dialogue can get pretty intense . Things got personal a few years back when Tom Fazio redid the bunkers at Merion . A lot of name-calling . Some thought that changing the bunkers was akin to drawing glasses on the Mona Lisa . It 's funny  --  the nicest , kindest gentleman can become a pit bull online ! But that 's part of the passion . It 's my passion , too . This is a nonprofit site . Since I started it in 1999 , I 've gotten a lot of offers to sell , but I never will . It 's like those commercials . Annual cost of running a web site : a few thousand dollars . Helping to keep architecture debate alive : priceless . " The Visionary ROGER FERRIS , 50 Designing the clubhouse of the future at the Bridge , on Long Island " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kong to London : banks , museums , homes . But when we were commissioned to build the clubhouse for The Bridge , on the east end of Long Island , I looked at the land  --  perched on a hill with 280-degree views of water  --  and I gulped . I said , " This site is so spectacular , I can only screw it up . ' Then I saw it as an opportunity , a way to echo how golf has evolved and become more stylish . A clubhouse is a chance to be inventive , to build on a vast , green landscape . You ca n't do that in London or Manhattan . Instead of mimicking classic designs , like Shinnecock 's , we went for something current , high-tech , Zen . What we created is sustainable , open and naturally cooled . From above , it looks like the golf swing , with a nexus as the core , and a " blade "  --  a section of the building  --  that appears thrown out , like a club moving along the swing plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take risks , you do n't achieve anything . One member said , " It looks like a spaceship ! " But they came around . Now they say , " This is the house I always wanted but never had the nerve to build .
