<p> boulder There 's a reason Colorado defensive tackle George Hypolite always wears a smile and is happy to discuss anything and everything - from politics to the New York Yankees ' pitching staff - with those who will listen . Hypolite enjoys and appreciates life more than most because he has witnessed more of life than most . <p> Whiffing on a tackle will never feel like the end of the world to somebody who has experienced his world . In his hometown of Los Angeles , Hypolite served almost 400 hours as a cook for Project Angel Food , a charitable organization that prepares and delivers meals for homebound victims of HIV and AIDS . He has worked at a shelter for battered women and children . <p> " To look in kids ' eyes , knowing that just by talking with them you 've made their day a little better . " Hypolite said , almost tearing up . <p> Cody Hawkins , Colorado 's redshirt freshman quarterback , realized soon after arriving on campus last year that there is something special , something different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's quick feet and brute strength . <p> Away from football , it 's Hypolite the humanitarian . <p> " To be an ambassador for our program , George is it , " Hawkins said . " And it helps on the field . To be a good athlete , you need balance in your life . You need to keep things in perspective . <p> " If he sees a player nervous , thinking he hopes he does n't screw up , George can say , ' Hey , I was just down at the homeless shelter last week . Those people love football , but they ca n't afford a ticket . " ' <p> Hypolite ca n't recall precisely the first time he volunteered but figures it must have been while he was in grade school , perhaps when he served as an altar boy at his Catholic church . Recently , he was named to the American Football Coaches Association 's " Good Works Team " that honors players for their dedication and commitment to community service . <p> The AFCA cited Hypolite for his volunteer work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angel Tree Project that provides gifts to children and senior citizens during the holiday season and other giving endeavors . <p> " We talk to players about being a successful person , and giving back is part of that , " CU coach Dan Hawkins said . " We have a big emphasis on community service . But George takes it to the next level . " <p> Invariably , Hawkins said , it all starts at home . Hypolite 's father skipped out on the family before George entered kindergarten . But Hypolite 's mother , Mary Clark , was always there for George and his older sister , Alexandra . Mom scattered books around the home so her kids would acquire a love for reading . She made sure to get home early enough each evening for a family dinner . She passed down her passion for volunteering . Like her brother , Alexandra began as an altar girl . <p> " It 's just critical to give back , " said Clark , a library manager at the University of Southern California . " You hear people say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I told George , if you participate in the little things , it makes a difference . And it makes you a better person . " <p> Clark also encouraged her kids to participate in other activities . George played Little League baseball and AAU basketball . He did n't try out for the football team until his sophomore year of high school . <p> " George told me he hoped to be 6-8 and play basketball for Georgetown , " Jamal Adams , Hypolite 's hoops coach at Loyola High School , recalled with a chuckle . <p> Ironically , it was Adams who coaxed Hypolite into trying football . Playing fullback and defensive end , Hypolite became an all-league performer by his junior season and as a senior was rated among the top 100 prospects in the West by various recruiting services . <p> " Other kids would ask their dad how they did in a game , but I 'd go to my mom and she 'd tell me if I did n't play as well as I should have , " Hypolite said . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Colorado coaches say they would n't trade Hypolite and nose tackle Brandon Nicolas for another inside tandem in the Big 12 Conference . The juniors have become the rock-solid foundation of the defense . <p> " One of the things that makes George a leader is he 's very smart , " Dan Hawkins said . " When some team is lining up in a certain formation , he will stand right up and say what they 're running . Guys respect that . " <p> " George tells special-teams guys their assignments and he does n't even play much special teams , " defensive coordinator Ron Collins added . <p> Although Hypolite had never played defensive tackle before arriving in Boulder , Adams is n't surprised Hypolite adapted quickly despite being a bit undersized for the position by Big 12 standards . <p> " George has the biggest heart going , " Adams said , " and I believe that has helped him succeed . We talk all the time about the power of giving . His volunteer work has given George discipline and accountability . You 're never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 303-954-1280 or tkensler@denverpost.com <p> Buffs ' defense proving to be stingy <p> Defense has carried Colorado through the early portion of the season . Since midway through the second half of the season-opening win over Colorado State , the Buffaloes ' defense has limited opponents to a 19.7 percent conversion rate ( 12-of-61 ) on third downs . And in the past three weeks , CU 's pass defense has limited the opposition to less than a 50 percent completion percentage in each game . A look at some reasons for CU 's stellar defensive play : <p> TALENT <p> When he arrived in Boulder before the 2006 season , coach Dan Hawkins inherited more talent on defense than on offense because Gary Barnett had recruited better on that side of the ball . Linebacker Jordon Dizon and cornerback Terrence Wheatley could earn first-team all-Big 12 honors . Defensive tackle George Hypolite and nose tackle Brandon Nicolas comprise one of the league 's top tandems inside . <p> EXPERIENCE <p> In their second season under defensive coordinator Ron Collins , players have become comfortable with the system and with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collins said . " Last year , we did n't really know what we were doing out there , " Wheatley admitted . <p> TOUGHNESS <p> Following CU 's 27-24 win Saturday , an Oklahoma player told a Tulsa newspaper the Sooners were surprised by how physical CU played . " We want that to be our identity , " Hypolite said . " We 're not the biggest defense , but we can still be tough and play tough . " <p> PLAYING FAST <p> Colorado 's defense has decent speed , not great speed , Collins said . " But because they know the system and are playing with confidence , they play fast to the ball , " Collins said . " You can have a fast defense that does n't know where to go . " <p> GAME PLANNING <p> Hawkins gives Collins kudos for " adding some wrinkles " to his schemes that keeps the opponent guessing .
