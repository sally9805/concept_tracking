Headnote Massachusetts ' chief executive makes history and begins to chart his own course // A Black governor ? And in Massachusetts , of all places ? Meet Deval L. Patrick , sworn in January 4 as the unlikely governor of the New England state , where only 7 percent of the population is Black . Governor Patrick is a lawyer 's lawyer who seems to have done it all-a civil rights attorney for the federal government and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund , corporate counsel for Coca-Cola and Texaco , and a partner in big Boston firms . He 's a brainy and personable 50-year-old who grew up poor on the South Side of Chicago , landed a scholarship to a prep school near Boston and then whipped through Harvard and Harvard Law School . One thing he had n't done-until two years ago-was run for political office , and hardly anyone gave him a chance . Adrian Walker , a Black columnist for the Boston Globe , was being generous when he initially declared the rookie candidate " probably a long shot . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried every county in the Democratic primary last September , collecting 50 percent of the vote . His closest competitor had only 27 percent . His momentum continued to grow , and in the November election , he won by a landslide : 56 percent for Patrick , 37 percent for the Republican lieutenant governor and two other candidates finished with the fewest votes . The victory was historic , making Patrick only the second African-American to be elected governor . L. Douglas Wilder , now mayor of Richmond , did it in Virginia in 1989 . Both won in two of the original 13 colonies , in states that call themselves " commonwealths , " which means for the good of all people . " If s been so long that people started to think 1989 was happenstance , an accident , a fluke-and thaf s not the case , " says Wilder . " What it says is if you prepare , start a campaign early on so people know who you are , it can happen . " But Patrick is n't governor because a state once known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so liberal and so Democratic . Ifs not anymore-independents now form the biggest bloc of voters . And a Democrat had not been elected governor for 16 years . The last was former presidential candidate Michael Dukakis . Massachusetts is also a state whose racial reputation , for many African-Americans , is still characterized by disturbing TV images of Boston school desegregation three decades ago . Angry White mobs attacked school buses carrying Black children to schools in South Boston and other White neighborhoods . There also was the painful image of a White man spearing a Black man in a three-piece suit with the shaft of an American flag-in front of City Hall . That Boston is gone too . Busing ended in 1999 . Blacks , Latinos and Asians have made up more than half the city 's population since 2000 . People of color now live in South Boston-without fear . The two White mayors the city has elected in the last 20 years reached out to African-American residents and addressed their needs . Winning Boston , though , is not enough to get elected statewide . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics is the best candidate does n't always win-whoever runs the best campaign usually does . Most considered him to be the best candidate and the best campaigner . By far , his was the most impressive resume . Being a Harvard graduate means something in Massachusetts . So did working in Washington as the assistant attorney general for civil rights for former president Bill Clinton . Connections in downtown law firms count too . " They loved his credentials . He was the most qualified for that job and also the most articulate , " says the Rev. Miniard Culpepper , the politically astute pastor of Pleasant Hill Baptist Church in Dorchester . " Folks loved his intellect . " Patrick 's campaign was well organized and upbeat . He and his wife , Diane , a partner in the Boston law firm of Ropes &; Gray , have prospered . They live in a million-dollar home in the suburb of Milton and own a $4 million vacation home in the Berkshires , the western part of Massachusetts , where W.E.B . DuBois grew up and James Weldon Johnson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent summers . But Patrick knew he could not match the campaign spending of rich rivals . Instead , he spent two years building a grass-roots organization-a tactic copied from Dukakis , who used it to recapture the governor 's office . What Patrick built was even bigger and better . He preached " the politics of hope , " a line borrowed directly from Clinton , who campaigned for him twice last fall . The optimistic rap gave Patrick the same kind of crossover appeal enjoyed by Illinois Senator Barack Obama , who also stumped twice for " another Black man from the South Side with a funny name , " as Patrick joked . The campaign 's slogan was " Together We Can . " The " we " meant not just Black folks , but everybody in the state , regardless of race , class or geography . " We had a commonwealthwide strategy-one message , one set of ideas , one candidate , talking about why it was important to cross all those differences to see your stake in one another , " Patrick explains . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poor boy from a tough neighborhood near the Robert Taylor Homes housing project in Chicago who made the most of a scholarship to Milton Academy from A Better Chance , at the time a Boston-based , nonprofit group that also helped singer Tracy Chapman and thousands of other young , gifted and Black inner-city kids attend elite New England prep schools . In Chicago , the family lived on welfare . Patrick , his mother , Emily Patrick , and sister Rhonda shared a bedroom . His grandmother Sally was an important influence . Patrick says his father , Pat , abandoned the family when Patrick was 5 or 6 to play jazz saxophone for Sun Ra in New York . While in prep school , Patrick delivered newspapers near campus to earn money . Sixteen years ago , the Patricks bought a big house on his old paper route , a detail noted in his official campaign biography . His late mother and grandmother lived with them . Deval and Diane Patrick still stay there with their daughters Sarah and Katherine . " I always knew he was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Annette Buchanan , a Washington lawyer who was a classmate at Milton Academy . " You could just tell . He was so focused . " The uplifting tale about his life resonated . His campaign signs sprouted in Boston , not just in Black neighborhoods like Roxbury , but in the shops of Vietnamese immigrants along gritty Dorchester Avenue . They were outside the mansions on narrow , wooded lanes in the wealthy suburb of Lincoln , where some seem to think street lights would make the place look too urban . Edward W. Brooke knows what it takes to get elected statewide in Massachusetts . He did it four times in the 1960s and 1970s-as a Black Republican candidate for state attorney general and U.S. senator . He was impressed with Patrick 's campaign . " He did it skillfully , " says Brooke , who turned 87 in October , and now lives in Miami . Wilder , who was among the thousands-including hundreds of beaming African-Americans who watched Patrick take the oath of office with his hand on a Bible given to John Quincy Adams by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " tremendously impressed " with the way Patrick campaigned , " not touting race , but not running away from race , and not being afraid of being judged by any other standard . " " I am descended from people once forbidden their most basic and fundamental freedoms , a people desperate for hope and willing to fight for it-and so are you , " Patrick said from the state-house during Massachusetts ' first outdoor inaugural . Patrick 's decision to run for governor caught most people by surprise , but Bill Clinton was not one of them . Twenty years ago , Patrick and Lani Guinier , both then working for the NAACP-LDF , sued to stop voting rights violations in Arkansas , where Clinton was governor . Patrick befriended Clinton , other defendants , and the clerks who set rules for voter registration in each county . At a meeting that settled the lawsuit , Clinton watched Patrick converse with the clerks , and then said to Guinier , now a Harvard law professor , " He has a future as a politician . " A possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office a decade ago . But he says he was talked out of it " by a bunch of people , including my wife , " whom he describes as " stronger than steel . " About two years ago , he decided that being a chief executive was what really appealed to him . The couple and their families had long discussions about a run for governor . This time , she agreed , in part because their daughters were older . It was bold for a Black man who had no political background to run for governor . " I was in it to win , " he says . Party leaders were lining up behind Thomas Reilly , the state attorney general , a seasoned Irish politician whose close relations with African-Americans went back to childhood . No matter , Patrick plowed ahead . " He 's always been daring , " says Theodore M. Shaw , director-counsel and president of the NAACP-LDF , who is a godfather of Patrick 's older daughter . " He dared to dream-not only dream , but to do it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He named a Haitian-American , state representative Marie St. Fleur , to run for lieutenant governor as his running mate . The move blew up almost immediately after reports that St. Fleur owed back taxes . She withdrew . Reilly never recovered . In his election night victory speech , Patrick said , " I am here to serve as governor of the whole commonwealth . " He spoke about how his mother learned he was running for governor just before she died in early 2005 . " We spread her ashes this morning , election day , as a way to mark this milestone in our family 's journey , and to honor her lasting presence in our lives . " Now the hard part begins-governing . Patrick has to find the money to pay for his campaign promises that include hiring 1,000 new police officers and expanding all-day kindergarten . He also has to live up to a vow to create more affordable housing . Then there is the cost of living , which is forcing some residents out of state and preventing some newcomers and businesses from coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes , if possible . " The challenge he has is to match promises with deeds , " Wilder says . " Be certain that the safety net is there , jealously guard the rating of the treasury , come out swinging from the very beginning , fighting for the things that matter most to the people of Massachusetts . " It may not be easy to do , but getting elected the nation 's second Black governor was n't either . Sidebar Massachusetts Gov . Deval L.
