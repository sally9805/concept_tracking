MELBA KUPERCHMID WAS A BEAUTIFUL ONE , and everybody knows what happens to the beautiful ones . Scooped up and gone before she turned twenty . He was a traveler ; nobody even knew his name or what he did for a living , only that he had daring and never lived in one place for long . But Melba 's old friend Sarah Kaplan used to get postcards from places that did n't seem very romantic from the photographs . Windsor , Canada , for one . St. Louis , Missouri , for another . Then , twentythree years after she left , as everybody claimed they knew in their heart of hearts would happen sooner or later , Melba Kuperchmid came home . Discarded like the beautiful ones always are , one way or another . But when she came back to Fall River , she was n't fat like everybody expected . She was still gorgeous . Still had all that hair and those enormous black eyes men fell into and flailed . Still Melba , not destroyed , even a little giggly like she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussing it . <p> For a few months she went to cocktail parties and talked ( politely ) to the husbands , letting everybody know from the way she refused to laugh at the men 's bad jokes that she wanted no part of them . This of course made the wives suspicious . What else could a returned ( spurned , vanquished ) divorcee possibly want if not their potbellied husbands ? The other curious thing was that not long after she came home ( she had no family left , and she 'd had no children ) , Melba-now in her midforties-opened a seamstress shop on Corky Row , apparently with her alimony money . She 'd always been good at sewing ; a lot of the girls remembered that . But Melba Kuperchmid ? A seamstress ? <p> Sarah 'd always loved her . As girls they often left school in late morning and spent afternoons trudging the mud along Watupa Pond . Slogging and hackling about people . They used to talk about what they 'd do when they got to Paris . Twirl in the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men with unpronounceable names and wispy , tuggable mustaches . For Sarah , Melba 's return was a strange jolt . She 'd been marching forward . She 'd raised Rhoda into a girl people talked about ( Rhoda 'd been elected Most Garrulous and Best Dancer by her class at Durfee ) . Sarah 'd served as volunteer chair of the hospital charity luncheon eleven years in a row , and was a respected member ( and treasurer ) of the Hebrew Ladies Helping Hand Society . The new house on Delcar was n't so new anymore , but the mortgage was far from dead and buried . There was Walt and his cars . He talked about his old junked cars like they were children who 'd grown up and gone away . Now he was in love with Volvos , which made him , according to him , avant-garde . Rhoda was already in her fifth term at Simmons the year Melba came home , 1961 . <p> Was it really possible that she wanted nothing more than to open a shop and live quietly , modestly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself from the gossip of the girls . There were all kinds of explanations . Dotty Packer said that some cousin of Leddy Levine ( of the Harry Levines ) told her that Melba 's ex-husband was a gambler who fled because he was wanted by J. Edgar Hoover and the Sugar House Gang for extortion and unpaid debts . Somebody else-Ruth Gerard  --  said Melba 's husband was a kind of junior-issue sheik who got summoned back to Arabia to marry a sultan 's firstborn daughter . That was a good one . Ruth Gerard always came up with good ones , and Sarah chose not to mention that she had in her possession an old photograph ( Melba sent it from the Midwest somewhere ) of the man she married , and he was white as white could be , shirtless , leaning against a tree , wearing a bowler and a crimped smile that made him look like he was being pinched , but oh , was he handsome , very . The only thing Sarah would offer the gossip-eaters was a lie she claimed she heard from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melba because it was from her husband Felix that Melba rented shop space ) that Melba left him , not the other way around . This of course prompted Bea Halprin to huff , " Well in that case , where 's her other man ? And why come back here if life was so wonderful she could ditch him in the first place ? " <p> The fact was that nobody knew because nobody asked . Even the most fearless Nosey Parker , Edi Dondis , did n't have the courage to broach the subject directly . Because there still floated about Melba a halo of untouchableness , an aura that went beyond her physical beauty into realms no one could describe in conversation . She 'd had it since she was a child , and everybody recognized that it still shrouded her with as much force as ever . ( For example , they all started wearing hats indoors again . ) Yet since Melba was a shopkeeper now , it became a question of class . This did n't bother Sarah , of all people , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invite her to cocktail parties , and eventually the girls stopped asking her to most things , except the occasional low-profile noncharity luncheon . And when this did n't appear to ruffle Melba 's feathers , some of the girls started saying maybe there 's something wrong upstairs . Did n't something like this happen to Erma Zagwell 's brother Jerome , that one morning he just refused to get out of bed ever again ? There was a lot of dispute on this point , because even those who stopped sending over invitations still took their dresses to Melba to be fitted or let out . First , out of pity , they took things they no longer wore . Later they relied on her because she was so good they could n't live without her . Finally the consensus was that anybody that excellent with the needle ( particularly after all these years ) could n't possibly be crazy . But that did n't make the socializing problem easier for anybody . <p> About eight months into Melba 's return , Sarah parked the big Lincoln Town Car on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Walt always insisted she drive his past loves ; this one was so huge it did n't fit in the garage . ) But she did n't get out of the car . Instead , she paused and reflected that she 'd spent a good chunk of her time in the market worrying over the mystery of Melba Kuperchmid : her lack of bitterness , her lack of interest in reclaiming any former glory . They had all been so jealous of what she had-the envy of a thousand girls-that it must have been real . Now her coming home and not caring a lick put everything into question . The way she used to walk the halls , as if stepping on puddles of air nobody else could see , the boys quivering and gnawing their collars . Sarah left the groceries in the car and went inside to look for something that needed mending . Not finding anything , she went into Walt 's closet forest of white shirts and ripped a tear in the sleeve of one . Got back in the car , melting strawberry ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and headed down the hill to Corky Row . She found Melba behind the counter , alone , working the Singer , the clicking monotonous , feverish , loud enough that she did not hear Sarah open the chimeless door . <p> And Sarah stands mesmerized by the back of Melba 's head . Her hair is pulled back tight in a plait ; its end rests on her shoulder . Sarah looks at the exquisite columns that form that familiar neck . If she could freeze a moment in time , she 'd freeze this one . The one before Melba finally turns around and sees her , because it is n't the new Melba she wants , it 's the old one , the one who left here looking for something better . To ask what it 's like to be so loved that rolling your tongue around your teeth 's enough to make men swoon and need cold water . And that still not be enough for you . Melba with your simple black hair and big eyes , still no breasts to boast to the Queen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? Are n't you ? You were two years older than me . And you used to whisper that you 'd stolen a pack of Mr. Jalbert 's cigarettes . Come on , Sar . We 're as good as gone ! And that was all it ever took . <p> In the shop , pressing her handbag and the shirt to her chest , listening to the manic click of the machine , watching Melba 's head . Maybe Sarah will tell her again ( she wrote her about it after , in a flurry , and sent the letter to one of the many addresses she had for Melba then ) about her own escape from Fall River . She 's sure Melba 's forgotten , if the letter even made it to her . And of course it was only for a weekend , but there was Sarah Gottlieb 's famous eloping to Rhode Island . People still talk about how Rhoda was born big and healthy barely seven scandalous months later , and how Sarah 's mother 's rage lasted till the day she died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She never thought it 'd matter again ( she was just like so many other people now ) , but now her once running means more . <p> She clears her throat . " Melba , dear , I thought I 'd drop by and bring you- " <p> Melba swivels her stool . Some wrinkles below her eyes like the veins of a leaf the only change . It could be 1936 . They could be on the shore of the Watupa talking about Howie or Hughie , the one from Boston who chased Melba for months , one of the many she did n't choose , the one who kept circling her block in his convertible , hundreds of times . They called them Howie 's laps , and they became as much a part of the neighborhood as Mrs. Gilda Rubover 's garden of rabbit skeletons . <p> Yes , the same as ever , but tired now too . Maybe it 's the sallow light of the store , but there 's exhaustion in that still beautiful face . Melba 's eyes linger before she welcomes Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the sweat 's pooled on the nape of her neck-a glimpse of what 's disappeared in that trickle of moment before Melba calls , sprightly , over the machine 's noise . " Ah , Sarah . You brought me some mending . " <p> And Sarah looks at her and thinks , We 're becoming older women , on the verge of being like those fat-ankled waddlers at the club , the ones Walt says keep disappearing into their shoes . Even you . <p> Melba waves her closer . " Sit ! Sit ! " The shop is cluttered and stuffy . Fabric 's in piles on the floor . Skirts clipped on hangers draped over ironing boards . There are books on a shelf alongside a stack of sewing magazines . There 's a bowl of chocolate and a ripped calendar . Even you , Melba . You ca n't hide behind not caring . <p> Melba tosses a pincushion away , wipes off a wooden school chair with a rag . " Sit ! Sit ! For God 's sake , sit down , Sarah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Too too long . I have n't laid eyes on you in weeks , ages , honey . " <p> She sits on the edge of the chair to make clear she ca n't stay long , that she 's only pausing for a quick chat . She tells Melba about the shirt , what a klutz Walt is , how he insists on wearing his good clothes around the house to fix things that do n't need fixing . But even as she rambles on , she becomes aware of something in the way Melba said " weeks , ages . " As if they are n't different . And then she knows , all at once , what should have been the obvious truth all along : that the marriage was short-lived , that the husband probably did n't last a year or two after that shirtless picture by the tree , that it was Melba who did all the moving around , that she 'd been alone , that she 'd been a seamstress for the last twenty-odd years , a damn good one , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that in her case it was n't to chase her past ; she merely wanted to live near it . That proximity itself was comfort . <p> That she 'd been alone , probably many years alone , maybe even because she wanted to be . Sarah thinks of Walt , how during the day she often forgets about him , but how he arrives every afternoon , breathing heavily at the back stoop , arms full of more junk they 'd never need ; but he arrives , always , some afternoons knocking on the door with his head because he 's got no free hand . And yes she feels pity , but Sarah 's first instinct is to rub Melba 's unchanged face in everything she does n't have , to unbuckle her handbag and wave pictures of Rhoda . Rhoda 's report cards , her hundred boyfriends , her honor society pins , her still-life drawings of fruit and vegetables . . . . <p> They make small talk about the shop and some things Melba 's working on . She 's doing Nina Shetzer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glum ! The bridesmaids are going to look like the walking wounded . ) But after a couple of awkward , too-long silences , Sarah ca n't keep herself from blurting : " I hate myself for saying this , Melba , but the girls all talk about your life like it 's a train wreck . " <p> Melba laughs and swoops her arm in an arc to dismiss them all , every last one of them . And what 's incredible is that even her voice is the same , thick and direct like a man 's , like the rocks she used to throw into the Watupa . " Tell them I was never a whore . Tell those yappies that . " <p> Sarah does n't nod , only stares and seeks forgiveness from Melba 's eyes for being no better than everybody else , for reveling in such a miraculous and perfect failure . She thinks of the early postcards , the black-and-white photographs , Melba 's zigzagged scrawl . Darling Sarah , We 've moved to a place called Wabash in Indiana . We live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushing river . Reminds me a bit of home , but the rivers are so much smaller here . Please write ! 1 do n't know two souls here . Your M <p> " Not one of them ever once called you that . Not one . " <p> But Melba 's still laughing at the thought and does n't care if they did or they did n't . She scoots her stool closer , leans , and squeezes Sarah 's wrists . Her palms are hot and wet from work . <p>
