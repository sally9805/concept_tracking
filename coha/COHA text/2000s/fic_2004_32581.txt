Chapter One I did not attend Harry 's company 's annual Holiday Raffle . Spouses and partners were never invited . Harry 's company believed that restricting company-sanctioned gatherings to employees encouraged collegial bonding . This always seemed to me like a euphemism for extramarital affairs , though Harry assured me it was n't . " It 's just dot-com nonsense , Francie , " he said , pulling on his coat and patting the pockets for his keys . " Some business psychologist told them to do it , so they do . " He stood by the door , shifting from foot to foot , jingling his change . He always got nervous before he had to go to a party . " Too many adults walking around unattended , " was how he explained it . But everybody in the company had to participate in the Holiday Raffle . You had to sign in with the office manager to prove that you 'd been there . Harry 's company was so uptight I was n't even allowed so say what it was he did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more talk of the company stock going public , but I was n't supposed to say that , either . The company was an Internet spin-off of the staid and stodgy company where Harry had worked for nearly twenty years . At forty-three , he 'd been the oldest employee to make the leap . Now , at forty-seven , he was the one the twenty-something dot-cowboys were referring to when they whispered , " It would n't hurt to have some white hair in on the deal . " Enter Harry , familiar as a slice of Wonder Bread in his conservative tie , his wandering hairline , his solid mass of reassurance . The clients signed on the dot-com line . The cowboys high-fived one another over the tops of their cubicles . " That 's the only time they listen to me , " Harry complained now , the change in his pockets jingling like sleigh bells . " When they think something might fall through . As soon as things are back on track , they hustle me out of the picture . " " Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's the problem . " More sleigh bells . " To them , anybody over thirty is ancient . They call me Father Time . And that 's what they call me to my face . " " Say something , " I urged him , even though I knew he would n't . Harry was n't big on confronting people . Sure enough , even the possibility was making him uncomfortable . He turned to open the door . " Ah , well . They 're only kids . " He winced at the blast of cold air . " Deep down , they love me , right ? " " They love your cookies , anyway . " " Cookies . " The thought seemed to cheer him . " I 'll be back as soon as I can . " I , for one , was talking about the actual , edible kind of cookie-known in company parlance as literal cookies-as opposed to the cyberspace cookies that they were all busily coding and decoding . On hump days-that is , Wednesdays-Harry always brought in four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office microwave . Many were his own inspired recipes : Helplessly Chocolate , Peppermint Power , Coconut Monkey Faces . The Peanutbetter Butterbursts , however , remained everybody 's favorite , and the aroma never failed to lure the cowboys in from the flat-screened fields . They elbowed one another out of the way like the children they still were . They chewed with their mouths open . They tried to sneak handfuls back to their workstations , which had been forbidden ever since crumbs had gotten into a keyboard and made it go berserk . Harry liked to describe the scene in the voice-over tones of a nature documentary , even though he 'd signed a confidentiality statement promising not to discuss anything that happened at work . I tell you these things as a way of saying that it was no sacrifice to stay home from the Holiday Raffle , which always began with upbeat group exercises in cooperative thinking and mutual trust . Last year , the employees had to build some kind of scaffolding and help one another climb over it . Fortunately , Harry had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everybody had been very , very nice , he 'd told me later , on the way to the emergency room . This year , rumor had it that employees were supposed to take turns standing on chairs and falling backward into one another 's arms . Harry 's waist was now a tight forty-two . I just did n't want to think about it . So as soon as his car pulled out of the driveway , I got to work decorating the house for the holidays . It was the first year we 'd be relatively on our own . Tina and Trish were volunteering with Habitat for Humanity . Amber had flown to Jamaica with Malvin , declaring that December in Pittsburgh and suicide were synonymous . My mother , who had retired to Florida , begged off with the promise of attending Jason 's high-school graduation in June , when the weather was civilized . At least Jason was still around , studying upstairs in his room , but who could say where he 'd be next year ? He was graduating at the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruiters had been calling nonstop ; Cornell and Stanford had already offered scholarships . At seventeen , he 'd be gone . It would be just Harry and me . There 'd be time for hobbies . Weekend getaways . Maybe even those gym memberships . And on the horizon ? Retirement . Travel . A couple of grandkids . An RV with one of those waving yellow signs in the window : caution : i 'm spending my children 's inheritance . Frankly , it did n't sound half bad . I polished the menorah from my daddy 's side of the family and set it on the dining room table . I scattered foil-wrapped chocolate coins across the mantel for gelt , even though I knew that Harry would just eat them . Then I hauled the artificial Christmas tree down from the attic in honor of my mother 's Baptist kin . I vacuumed away the cobwebs , untangled the various strings of lights , and fitted them with multicolored fish of no particular denomination . Finally , I dug out the enormous Christmas clock that Harry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . It 's face was-what else ? - Santa Claus 's face , and every time the hour struck , an awful mechanized voice chortled , " Ho-Ho-Ho ! " It overwhelmed my daddy 's lovely old menorah like a condominium complex beside a turn-of-the-century Victorian . I hated the thing , but the kids had always adored it . To them , it was part of the holiday season , like spinning the dreidel , like eggnog and fruitcake . I was studying the Christmas tree , debating the tinsel issue , when Jason came down the stairs . " You put up the tree , " he said reproachfully . " I would have helped , you know . " " I knew you were studying . " " I could have taken a break . " " Sorry , Pop-Tart . " Harry 's old nickname for Jason had stuck , but Jason did n't seem to mind . Regardless of test scores , he would always be Pop-Tart to his family . The Santa Claus clock chimed ten p.m . " Ho-Ho-Ho ! Ho-Ho-Ho ! Ho-Ho-Ho ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His mouth opened into a little round Ho ! of his own beneath the wispy mustache he 'd been trying to grow for a year . " Aw , the Santa Claus clock ! " he said , forgiving me everything . " I love that clock . " " I know . " " The tree needs tinsel , do n't you think ? " " I was actually thinking of stringing popcorn instead . " " I 'll make it , " he said , heading for the kitchen . " Dad still out ? " " Yup . " " Is n't he late ? " " A little . " " Think he got hurt again ? " " I hope not . " Jason shook the heavy pan as the kernels rattled and popped . He had his father 's way with popcorn ; the smell was heavenly . " Let 's put butter on that batch , " I said , digging through the junk drawer for the sewing kit . " We can always make more for stringing . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole stick of butter in a bowl and stuck it in the microwave . To look at him , you 'd never have guessed that he came from a family that did not believe in margarine . He was so thin that it made me want to apologize . I suspected his accelerated brain was leeching necessary minerals from his body . " I wonder if Dad 'll win anything this year , " he mused . I 'll say this for Harry 's company : Their raffle prizes were extraordinary . Many were prototypes for things you still could n't buy on the market . " I could go for the flat-screened portable TV , " I said . Jason made a face . " I hope he wins the robo-dog . " " I hope he does not win the robo-dog ! " " Aw , Mom , you 'd love it . I 'd program it to get your slippers . " " I do n't wear slippers . " " I 'd program it to follow you around and keep you company . " Jason saved a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest into the same bowl Harry and I had shared for so many years . He dumped the butter in with a splash and carried everything to the table . I handed him a needle , already threaded . " The last thing I need , " I said , stabbing a hot kernel , " is some little mechanical thing following me around . I spent too many years with little human things following me around . " Jason was more interested in eating popcorn than in stringing it . He filled his mouth with an impossibly large handful , then studied me , crunching . Since his babyhood , he 'd looked somber , thoughtful , even when he was smiling , and he was n't smiling now . " What ? " I said . " You 're going to be lonely , " he said . " After I 'm gone . So will Dad . " " You wo n't be gone , you 'll be in college , " I protested , though it was exactly what I 'd been thinking earlier . Jason had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'd think to yourself , I 'm kind of thirsty , and he 'd appear with a glass of water . It was unnerving . " You may experience mild to moderate depression , " Jason said , adopting a formal tone . " You might start to question fundamental assumptions . Basic values could appear subjective . " " In other words , I 'll be reaching for the Prozac ? " " Do n't laugh , " he said , shaking his head disapprovingly . " While it 's true that professionals often dismiss the plight of the empty nester , the syndrome is a genuine phase-of-life transition with genuine consequences . It 's best to be prepared . " I stared at my mathematically brilliant , hopelessly earnest son . In many ways , he seemed younger than seventeen . He was planning a career in quantitative psychology , which I gathered had something to do with creating statistical programs on computers to map the impulses of the human brain-after getting his M.D. , of course . I imagined him in his high-school cafeteria with the athletes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quantum physics and pop psychology dancing like sugarplum fairies in his head . At six , seeing me unplug the vacuum with a yank of the cord , he explained why it was safer to grasp the plug , elaborating on the conductive nature of electricity . I could see that same six-year-old in him now , and I wanted to embrace him , but you do n't do that to a teenage boy-even a boy like Jason , who prided himself on being free of what he called Oedipal angst . " Around that same time , " he continued soberly , " it is likely Dad will have a midlife crisis . Mom , do n't laugh . It 's hormonal . His testosterone levels will drop . There 's nothing funny about it . " " I 'm sure there is n't , " I said , stringing popcorn madly . " It may be happening already , " Jason continued . " Have you noticed he 's looking kind of , you know , puffy ? " " Puffy ? " Jason nodded . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any idea how much he weighs these days ? " I shook my head . I thought I 'd been the only one who 'd noticed that , after years of slow creepage , Harry 's weight had been rising exponentially . I 'd been planning to say something to him about it , too , as soon as the holidays were out of the way . He always ate more around the holidays . He also ate more whenever he was bored , or unhappy , or nervous about something , or-especially-working long hours . Lately , since the dot-coms had been strafed by reality , he 'd been putting in ten-hour days-all the surviving dot-cowboys did the same . But they were twenty years younger than Harry . Perhaps he was simply feeling his age . On weekends , he seemed to be sleeping more and more . Napping in the afternoon . Falling asleep on the couch after dinner . He was oddly ... sluggish . Puffy , too . But it had been a particularly dark and dreary Fall . Everyone in Pittsburgh was sluggish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . " I was still trying to keep things light . " But the question is why ? " Jason said . " For physiological reasons ? Is he craving some vital fatty oil to regulate his amino acids ? Or perhaps ... " " Perhaps what ? " " Perhaps he 's been seeking emotional solace in food . " " Or perhaps he 's just been eating too much , " I repeated . " People do n't ' just eat too much . ' " Jason fixed me with a paternal stare . " Are you and Dad , you know , okay ? " " Jason ! " I did n't know whether to laugh or be offended . After twenty-four years , Harry and I were n't exactly honeymooners , but still . We enjoyed each other 's company . We never fought . Sometimes we even held hands at the mall . " Of course we 're okay . " " What about his job ? " They call me Father Time . " Jason , please , everything 's fine . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gramma Kligler was awfully overprotective , and Grampa- " With relief , I heard Harry 's car pull into the drive . " Hey , I think I hear the Hormonally Imbalanced One now . " Jason looked at me sympathetically . " Mom , " he said . " Just remember I 'm always here for you . I mean , if you ever want to talk . " " Thank you , " I said , as soberly as I could . " Do n't mention it . " " Hello ? " Harry shouted from the entryway , and not a moment too soon . " What did we win ? " I called back . " Just a minute and I 'll show you . " We could hear him taking off his coat . " The robo-dog ? " Jason said , his voice cracking with excitement . But when Harry padded into the room , he was carrying a flat , square box . Thankfully , he did n't look like a man who 'd spent the past few hours falling backward off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harry handed it over . " Not the dog . Sorry , Pop-Tart . " " Can I open it ? " he asked . " Sure . " Harry observed the tree . " Needs tinsel , do n't you think ? " Jason was already inside the box . " ' The New You Digital Scale with Select Vocalizations , ' " he read out loud . " Hey , a new scale ! Just what we need around here . " He gave me a thumbs-up behind his father 's back . " It was the prize next to the TV , " Harry said . " Can you believe it ? " " You were robbed , " I consoled him , ignoring Jason . " I tried to trade it for a sonic foot massager . " " You did the best you could . " " No , wait , Dad , this is really cool , " Jason said , flipping the box to read the back . " It 's got one of those learning chips . You have to program it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something needed to be programmed . " Be my guest , " Harry told him . He sat down with an oomph and started in on the popcorn . " What an evening . " " How can a bathroom scale learn ? " I asked Jason . " It remembers your profile . You know , how much you weighed the last time , what your ideal weight should be , that kind of thing . And then it responds accordingly . " Already he had the thing out of the box and was pushing buttons . " Hey , Dad ? " His voice was innocent . Continues ...
