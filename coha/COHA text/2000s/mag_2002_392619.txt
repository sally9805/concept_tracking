That kind of thinking is why Fidelity 's Fergus Shiel is so good at beating it . // TALK ABOUT TRUTH in advertising . The manager of the aptly named Fidelity Independence large-cap growth find hunts for stocks pretty much wherever he wants-overseas , in midcap turf , among beatendown value plays-and trades in and out of names at twice the pace of his peers . Asked to articulate his strategy , Fergus Shiel replies : " That would be tough because I 've always avoided having one ! ' It 's a freewheeling style you rarely see these days at Fidelity , now that more than half of its $817 billion in fund assets sit in individual retirement accounts . Indeed , the 45-year-old Shiel seems like a relic from Fidelity 's gunslinger past , when cowboys like Peter Lynch and Jeff Vinik steered funds . How does Shiel get away with it ? It helps that he 's beaten more than 90% of his peers for the past one- , three- and five-year periods . His five-year annualized return of 4.85% tops the S &P; 500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shiel added to his duties by taking over the highly rated Fidelity Fifty fund after longtime manager John Muresianu retired . Shiel spoke with MONEY 's Jeff Nash about his investing style ( or lack thereof ) and his views on today 's crummy stock market . Q. Why do you refuse to adhere to a specific investing style , such as growth or value ? A. You have to deal with the market instead of trying to squeeze the market into a specific style box . The market 's the boss . In the same way , I do n't get obsessed with buying a stock only when it falls within certain parameters that I 've simply made up . I let the market determine what the parameters are . Stocks can work for many different reasons . At the end of the year , if you look at the 10 stocks that worked , you 'll see that some of them worked because they were just regular growth stocks that grew faster than everyone thought . Others will work because they were really cheap . Q. What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for different things in different stocks . When you go to cyclical land , you have to look at valuations . The farther you get on the growth curve , the more you 're looking for momentum and acceleration of growth as a determinant of performance . All other stocks lie somewhere in between . I do n't do terribly well with companies that are based on big ideas . I do much better with companies based on solid financials . I look for free cash flow . I look at how a company creates excess capital and what it does with that excess capital . I try not to get too obsessed with any one benchmark or one way of looking at things . Q. You have about 25% of Independence 's assets in two tobacco stocks-Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds . Why such a big bet ? A. They 're the cheapest companies in the market . Maybe they should be because of the litigation overhang , but the capital that they throw out compared with the price you pay for it is phenomenally low . The real issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that excess capital . So far they 've been pretty good at this , in terms of giving it back to the shareholders in the form of high dividends . I 'd be glad to sell them if I could find anything in the market that looks as good , but there simply is n't . Q. That seems hard to believe . Nothing ? A. Look , the growth companies are at best holding their own ; very few are accelerating rapidly . You may find some sort of acceleration of growth with the smaller-caps , but the problem with small-caps is that they ultimately get knocked down by bigger companies that come to their markets with greater resources . I 'm very skeptical of smaller growth companies ; they seem to be trading at enormous multiples anyway On the other side , the classic value stuff has had a pretty good run . Maybe we 'll get a chance to buy that stuff again if everyone gets off the idea that there 's a big recovery going onI 'm not so sure there is-and prices come back down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the financial area , there are certain turnaround names-Bank One , for instance , and Bank of America  --  that I like a lot . They 've struggled a bit these past few years but have a new focus and new proactive managements that are trying to drive these companies to better returns . Q. Are you finding anything interesting in technology stocks ? A. It all depends on what you call tech . I have a big position in First Data , which some people call a tech company , but I do n't . It 's not like a Juniper Networks that 's trying to come up with a new box that can revolutionize the way data move around . I think of First Data as a tech-driven company , and so it rides that downward slope in tech prices . Basically , it 's a leader in processing transactions for credit cards and debit cards , and its fixed costs for doing this-computers  --  keep coming down so that every new customer means more profits . First Data trades at less than 20 times estimated ' 03 earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low double digits . On top of that , it 's a huge free-cash generator and management is buying a lot of their own stock-all the earmarks for me of a stock that can work . Another would be Xerox , an incredible turnaround story . There was a change in management . Then there was $7 billion in debt that had to be refinanced . That 's part of what was driving the stock down-liquidity concerns , the market wondering whether Xerox could refinance . But they did it-a good sign that they can pull off the turnaround .
