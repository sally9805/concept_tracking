Dr. Anya Crichton sat in the witness box and surveyed the room . Her gaze quickly found the teenager in the dock . Scott Barker sat , round-shouldered and eyes downcast . The university student was like any other , except for two things . His family was one of the most prominent in the state , but more importantly , Scott was on trial for murder . Judge Little took command . ' Please proceed , Mr. Brody . ' Anya concentrated on Dan Brody . The lawyer seemed more impressive in court than he did on any of his television appearances . ' Thank you , Your Honor . ' Smiling , Brody stood from behind the table , rising to his full six feet four inches . ' Could you please state your name and qualifications for the jury ? ' ' Anya Rose Crichton . ' Her voice remained even . Controlled breathing always helped . ' I am a medical practitioner , with specialist qualifications in forensic pathology and forensic medicine . ' ' For the benefit of the jury , Doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a forensic pathologist , I have conducted thousands of postmortems to establish cause of death . As a forensic physician , I assess wounds and injuries of people who have been assaulted or involved in an assault and survived . ' ' Could youplease tell the court where you gained your experience ? ' ' After completing my medical degree at the University of Newcastle  --  ' ' Yes , yes , Your Honor , ' interjected the prosecutor from his seat . ' There is no issue as to the expertise of this witness . ' Alistair Fraser sat shrouded in black silks , hands on his paunch . Anya 's back straightened . Fraser was already on rough footing . He had no intention of letting the jury hear the breadth of her experience and qualifications , her work at the State Forensic Institute or two years in England specializing in wound analysis . Brody placed both hands firmly on the lectern and addressed his witness . ' Doctor , could you please describe the circumstances under which you came to meet the defendant ? ' ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barker on the twelfth of December . He was in hospital for injuries following an alleged assault . I documented Scott 's wounds in case of permanent injury and/or further police investigation . ' ' And what did you find ? ' ' Scott Barker was in the emergency department with a series of wounds to his arms , hands and fingers . The incisions were deep and extensive . One particular injury severed the web between the base of his right thumb and index finger , as well as tendons in the right hand . ' Brody tendered photographs of Scott 's injuries to be shown later to the jury . ' And , Doctor , in your opinion , how were these wounds inflicted ? ' ' They are classic defense injuries . ' ' Could you please explain what you mean ? ' Brody asked . Looking to the jury , Anya carefully chose her words . ' These wounds result from attempts to ward off someone brandishing a sharp weapon . The victim instinctively raises his hands and forearms to protect his eyes , face and head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the twelve jurors . Three took notes , the others sat forward in their seats . ' In the process , the victim sustains the characteristic deep incisions to those areas . ' She paused . ' Exactly like the ones Scott suffered on the twelfth of December . ' Seeing Scott triggered vivid memories of that night . The shy youth claimed to be the victim of an unprovoked attack by two drunks outside a pub in Glebe . The attack was n't difficult to imagine ; the forensic evidence supported Scott 's version of events . As he walked home from Sydney University , two men stopped him , wanting to know what he had in his bag . In the confrontation , Scott 's laptop computer was smashed . When he yelled for someone to call the police , one of the men pulled out a switchblade . In the scuffle , the knife pierced the chest and heart of the larger man , killing him . The dead man had a blood alcohol reading three times the legal limit . The police case rested on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone berserk , broken his own computer and attacked the two men . Brody continued , ' Could you please explain why Scott would have such a deep cut to one palm only ? ' ' When someone is under attack they 'll do anything to defend themselves , even if it seems irrational . That includes grabbing the weapon by the blade . When the hand is closed around the blade , movement by the assailant results in cuts across the flexures of the phalanges , the palm side of the victim 's fingers . The blade slices through the skin , tissues and even tendons . In the process of grabbing the knife , Scott suffered permanent damage to that hand . ' Fraser jumped to his feet . ' Objection , Your Honor , ' he boomed . ' This is conjecture . The witness was not present and could not know who grabbed what , where or when . ' Judge Little curtly reminded Fraser he had accepted Dr. Crichton as an expert in this field and overruled the objection . The prosecutor flopped into his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' So , Doctor . ' Brody put a hand on one hip . ' Scott Barker is accused of cold-blooded murder , but you are saying Scott 's wounds suggest that he was , in fact , fighting for his own life . ' He paused for maximum effect . ' How likely is it that someone claiming to defend himself against a knife attack could suffer no defense injuries ? ' ' It would be unlikely . ' Anya clasped her hands as Brody prepared the final blow to Fraser 's case . ' You reviewed the postmortem report on the deceased ? ' Brody underlined something in his notes . ' Did the alleged victim , the deceased , sustain any injuries to his arms or hands to suggest he fought off a knife attack ? ' ' No . ' ' That 's all , Doctor . ' A murmur rumbled through the courtroom and in their gallery the press scribbled notes . Anya 's adrenaline surged as she watched the prosecutor haul himself to his feet . She wondered if this was how gladiators felt during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet another man died during this incident . ' Fraser faced the jury . . . . Continues ...
