Planning a wedding can be murder . Planning weddings for a living is nothing short of suicide . " Is there a patron saint for wedding consultants ? Because I think after this wedding , I just might meet the requirements . " I stood near the top of the wide marble staircase that swept down the middle of the Corcoran Gallery of Art 's central foyer . Below me , dozens of tuxedo-clad waiters scurried around the enormous hall filled end to end with tables and gold ladder-backed chairs . After having draped ivory chiffon into swags on all forty tables , I massaged the red indentations left on my fingers by the heavy pins . " Annabelle , darling , I may be a lapsed Catholic , but I 'm pretty sure you have to be dead to qualify for sainthood . " Richard Gerard has been one of my closest friends since I arrived in Washington , D.C. three years ago and started " Wedding Belles . " At the time , he 'd been the only top caterer who 'd bother talking to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusively . " The wedding is n't over yet . " " At least your suffering has n't been in vain . " Richard motioned at the room below us . " It 's divine . " The museum 's enormous hall did look magical . The side railings of the staircase were draped with a floral garland , leading to a pair of enormous white rose topiaries flanking the bottom of the stairs . Amber light washed eachof the three-story limestone columns bordering the room , and white organza hung from the ceiling , creating sheer curtains that were tied back at each column with clusters of ivory roses . " I just hope the MOB is happy . " My smile disappeared as I thought of the Mother of the Bride , Mrs. Clara Pierce . I started down the stairs to double-check the tables . " I do n't think she does happy . ' " Richard followed , his long legs catching up to me quickly . " If I 'd known she would make my life so miserable , I would n't have taken this wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair out of my face and tucked it back into my tight bun . I wore my hair up to make me look older and more experienced , but it did n't make me feel any different . I still got butterflies in my stomach at every wedding I planned . " You must be kidding , darling . " Richard lowered his voice as we reached the floor and a waiter walked past us . " This event is your ticket to all the big , society weddings . " " If society weddings mean more women like Mrs. Pierce , then I 'm not interested . " I leaned over the table closest to me and smoothed one of the organza bow napkin ties . " Well , sure , she 's been difficult ... " Richard came behind me and fluffed the bow back up . " Difficult ? " I narrowed my eyes at Richard and picked up another napkin . " I had to drive her fifteen-year-old , incontinent poodle to the church this afternoon . " " Her dog was a guest ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched as Richard began to shake with laughter . " Turns out there was n't enough room in the limousine for the wedding party and Muffles , so I got the honors . " " Look at the bright side . " Richard ran a hand through his dark , choppy hair . " You 're barely thirty , and you beat out all those older consultants for this wedding . " " Probably because I charge less than they do . The first thing I 'm doing on Monday is raising my rates . " I picked up an unlit votive candle , and Richard produced a long , butane lighter from his suit pocket . " Then we 're going shopping . " Richard gave me the once-over and shook the flame of the lighter at me . " If I see you in one more pantsuit , I 'm going to cry . " " But they 're so practical for working . " I looked down at my " lucky " navy blue suit . " Lucky " because the long jacket covered up the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And this one is silk . " " It 's a blend . " Richard shook his head as he rubbed the fabric of my jacket lapel between his fingers . " If you want to be an A-list wedding planner , then we 're going to have to dress you like one . " " Fine . As long as you promise not to go overboard . " " When would I ever go overboard ? " The spread col-lar of Richard 's fuchsia and green Versace shirt peeked out from underneath his black four-button suit . My eyes darted to his neck , and I cleared my throat . " You do n't like the shirt ? " Richard extended his arm so I could see the French cuffs . " It looks just darling with my white linen suit . I 'd have worn that tonight but I never wear white before Memorial Day . " " Thank God for small favors . " " Speaking of doing favors , I 'm also going to take you to the makeup counter . What 's the use of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I appreciate the flattery , Richard , but I do n't like to wear lots of makeup . " " No kidding . " Richard studied my face . " I 'm amazed you look half decent with that drugstore garbage . Imagine how great you 'd look if you used a designer line . " " I 'll think about it . " " It would be cruel to tease me . " Richard formed his lips into a pout . " If there 's any teasing to be done , I should be the one to do it . " My assistant , Kate , came down the staircase behind us , her high heels clicking on each step . Kate always wore heels to weddings to show off her legs and make her look taller . She said you never knew who you might see at a wedding , and I was pretty sure she did n't mean old family friends . " How 's it going upstairs ? " Richard asked . The nearly four hundred guests were being served cocktails on the upper level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sushi chefs almost quit because Mrs. Pierce timed them and took notes on their presentation . " " That damn notebook again . " I rubbed my temples with my index fingers ... Continues ...
