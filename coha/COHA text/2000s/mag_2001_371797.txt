Toys do n't get much more classic than Lincoln Logs : interlocking brown wooden pieces that kids since 1916 have used to build frontier cabins and fences . Under manufacturer Hasbro , Lincoln Logs languished in recent decades . But three years ago , a small company based in Hatfield , Pa. , called K'Nex , licensed the brand and found ways to push it into stores . Ever since , the toys have been tumbling into shoppers ' carts . With $50 million in sales this year , they 're more popular than ever . <P> But aggressive marketing to retailers is only part of the reason for the revival of the Logs .

The first spike in sales came among G.I. Joes and fire-fighter action figures . But a range of other oldies , many with fresh face-lifts , are proving to be this season 's hits : 1950s-era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shrinky Dinks and a 3-D Hot Wheels " fireball " raceway that Mattel says will be the biggest seller in the line 's 33-year history . <P> Anecdotal evidence suggests that while some kids are asking for these vintage favorites , parents and grandparents are also driving up demand and not just out of nostalgia . In a recessionary economy , parents who ca n't spring for a $300 XBox may still satisfy their kids with a less pricey updated classic , say , a Harry Potter Lego set . Cheap , classic board games are getting a boost too . Diane Quaiver of Villa Park , Ill. , says her 18-year-old daughter lately spends more time at home with her boyfriend and other friends .

Hasbro , after losing $200 million on an interactive division and website , sold both ventures for $100 million early this year . Mattel in 1999 bought educational-software maker The Learning Co. for $3.5 billion , only to unload it this year for an " undisclosed sum , " which analysts say was virtually nil . <P> Lately , though , investors have renewed their faith in both companies . Mattel 's stock has climbed 28% this year , while Hasbro 's has risen 63% . Mattel CEO Robert Eckert plans to slash 1,300 jobs and shutter the firm 's last U.S. plant ( most toys are made in low-wage Southeast Asia and China . ) He has moved product-development teams from El Segundo , Calif. , to Hong Kong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaner , nimbler operation , with toys shipped to retailers earlier in the season to avoid supply disruptions .
