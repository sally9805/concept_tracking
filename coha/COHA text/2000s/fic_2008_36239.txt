Impressions of North Korea : <p> Cold . Crappy food . Cheap booze . <p> Great place to hunt . Especially if you 're with the world 's cruelest dictator . <p> Not a good place to be shot , especially by said dictator . <p> But let me start at the beginning . . . <p> It was springtime at Rogue Manor : <p> The snow had melted , the crocuses and whatnot were pushing their pointy buds up through the turf , and there was a lovely scent in the air . <p> Gunpowder , that is . <p> It was the first week of April . Trace Dahlgren had just finished working with some new recruits for Red Cell International-the security company I run with a little help from my friends . Trace had spent the morning running the kids through a makeshift obstacle course on the back forty , trying to separate the wheat from the chaff . This was just a preliminary trial , so we gave them a nugget break-there were only two sections of live-fire exercise involved , and in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good six inches from anything moving . <p> Any recruit who stopped , of course , was fair game . <p> " No casualties , " said Trace , reporting in at lunchtime . She sounded disappointed . <p> Red Cell is an equal opportunity employer-we hire ex- army as well as ex- SEALs , and I think we even have an old air farcer on the payroll . As a former blanket hugger and a member of the female persuasion herself , Trace Dahlgren gives the company that well- rounded culture the human resources department Richard Marcinko and Jim DeFelice 16 would love to brag about , if we had a HR department . She learned how to break in new recruits while working with Delta Force , the army 's counter-terror unit . ( If you 're a faithful reader-and you sure as hell better be-you 'll recall that Trace was a member of Delta 's female squadron.2 ) At five- eight and 130 pounds , Trace has assets male shooters do n't , which makes her deadly in the field as well as undercover , both literally and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humps during training-even I have trouble keeping up with her PT routines-which is why she 's in charge of what we call prerecruitment month at Red Cell . <p> You like these Roman numerals and mini- chapter breaks ? Yeah , neither do I , but it was the editor 's idea . We have to do something he wants , or he wo n't spring for drinks next time we see him . <p> The participants call it hell , along with some other choice terms of endearment-high compliments from guys and gals who have survived SEAL training and the like . Basically , if you make it through the month at Rogue Manor with all of your limbs intact , we offer you a job . The pay 's great and the bennies ca n't be beat , though rumor has it that the boss is one mean son of a bitch . <p> We were in the process of gearing up for some new business ventures in Eastern Europe , and I was more than a little interested in finding out about what the new crop of recruits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed report , Rogue Manor 's early- warning radar began sounding an intruder alert . <p> No , it was n't a high- tech burglar alarm-my dogs were hounding a black Lexus LS 460L as it sped up the driveway . Yappy , being male , took up the lead , with Macey and Rosie right behind him . Abbey hung back a bit , surveying the scene ; she was the oldest , and had to present a dignified demeanor . I went out on the porch and watched the car fishtail around the curves and then slam to a stop in the muddy gravel in front of the house . The driver jumped from the front of the car as it stopped and tried to run around to open the rear passenger door . The dogs intercepted him , pinning him against the car . They were n't being malicious , nor were they hungry ; they had n't had a chance to play all day . <p> Officially , Delta 's " funny squadron " does n't exist , and has n't since it was created in 1993 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " shouted the man , and right there I had a feeling that the day was going to be more interesting than usual . Because not only was he speaking Korean-loosely translated , " Meomcheseyo ! " means " God damn it , stop this bullshit right now ! " - but he had a North Korean accent . <p> The problem was , in dog speak " Meomcheseyo ! " means something like Come on and jump on my car , sniff my crotch , and hump my leg . The dogs were happy to comply . They were so excited I had to whistle three times before they remembered who kept their food dishes filled . <p> " Inside , now , " I told them when they finally looked in my direction . <p> They gave the air a sniff , decided they did n't like what they smelled , and retreated . <p> With the dogs gone , a gorgeous woman emerged from the car . When I say gorgeous , I do n't mean drop- dead gorgeous-I mean kick you in the throat , douse you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace of remorse gorgeous . She was Asian , and as I gathered , Korean . Black hair , red skirt-short , short skirt-and a figure that demanded you do politically incorrect things in public . <p> " Annyeonghaseyo , " I told her , bowing my head , both in respect and to get a closer look at her legs . <p> " Enough with the Korean , " she said sharply . " Your accent is terrible . You are Richard Marcinko , Mr. Rogue Warrior ? " <p> " Dick to you , " I said . " I love a woman who gets to the point . " <p> Not to mention one who was holding a Smith &amp; Wesson revolver six inches from my head . I ca n't imagine where she 'd been hiding it ; there sure was n't any extra room in the dress . <p> " Nice pistol , " I said . <p> " It 's loaded , Dick . " <p> " So are you . " <p> " You are a very funny man , Mr. Marcinko . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Special , a Model 37 I believe , with the blued J frame . Manufactured by S&amp;W back in the day , it was a .38 caliber snub- nose , still a nasty little customer if you 're not expecting it . <p> The chauffeur , meanwhile , had recovered from his encounter with the dogs and was reaching into his jacket . <p> " You can point anything you want at me , " I told the woman . " But if he takes a gun out of his pocket he 's going to eat it . And then the dogs are going to eat him . " <p> She said something to him in Korean . The chauffeur frowned , but kept what ever weapon he had holstered . <p> " So , Mr. Marcinko , you do not seem as brilliant in real life as you are on the page , " said the woman , returning to English . " There is a little bit of fiction in your accounts , no ? " <p> Everybody 's a critic these days . <p> " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My study is always open . " <p> " You want to get me in bed , is that it ? " <p> " If that 's what it will take . " <p> She moved the Smith &amp; Wesson so that it was no longer aimed at my head , though I 've often been accused of having my brains where she pointed it . <p> " I am not here to sleep with you , " she told me . <p> " Who said anything about sleeping ? " <p> She finally smiled . But that was the extent of our budding romance-Trace interrupted our tOte-a-tOte with a flying jump from the side roof , landing on my Korean guest . I grabbed the Smith &amp; Wesson as it flew into the air . <p> " Meomcheseyo ! " I told the chauffeur as he started to reach for his gun . " One more inch and you 'll have a new hole to eat kimchi out of . " <p> Red Skirt was beautiful , tough , and highly skilled in Korean kickboxing . Trace is just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warrior : Dictator 's Ransom 19 expert in Jeet Kune Do , the martial art that Bruce Lee made famous . <p> Was n't much of a match . Trace had her pinned inside of ten seconds . <p> " All right , let her up , " I said as the dust settled . " It 's not every day the most hated dictator in the universe sends a personal representative to visit Rogue Manor . " <p> Trace and Red Skirt gave me a funny look , but it was pretty obvious who she worked for . The only other people who would have been so rude were members of the Christians in Action- otherwise known as the CIA-and no intelligence officer was going to drive a Lexus limo this close to the Langley accounting staff . <p> " I am here to deliver an invitation , " said Red Skirt . <p> " At the point of a gun ? " asked Trace . <p> " In America , does n't everyone travel with guns ? " asked Red Skirt . " It is required by your Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled out a leather briefcase . Trace tensed behind her as she opened it , but all she produced was an envelope . It was made of thick , fancy paper and had a wax seal at the back . It looked like the invitations I get when one of the great- aunt 's grandchildren decides to get hitched . <p> " Mr. Rogue Warrior , hand- deliver " was written on the outside . <p> " Sealed with a kiss ? " I asked , turning it over . <p> " Maybe we should check it for a bomb , " said Trace . <p> I broke the fancy seal on the back and slipped open the envelope . There was an invitation inside , engraved of course , written in both English and Hangul , the Korean script . <p> At least I assume that 's what those squiggly characters were about . <p> Dear Mister Marcinko : Your honorable presence for drinks and dinner is humbly requested by the great one , Kim Jong Il . Ms. Chimdae will make the arrangements . <p> There 's something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out-that always gets me in a special place . <p> Usually my wallet . <p> " Thanks , but no thanks , " I told Red Skirt , handing back the invitation . " Have a pleasant day . " <p> Ms. Chimdae gave me a blank look . Obviously no one in her experience turned down a request from the Great Dictator . <p> I cracked open her pistol and slipped the bullets out , giving the cylinder a good spin before handing the gun back . " The dogs will be back out in a minute . Your chauffeur will probably feel more comfortable if you 're off the property by then . " <p> " You do not understand , Mr. Marcinko . This is a great honor , " said Chimdae . <p> " No doubt . " <p> " You be sorry for this , Rogue Warrior , " chirped the chauffeur . " Very sorry . " <p> " Words to live by , " I said , turning around and heading for the door . <p> Excerpted from Rogue Warrior : Dictator 's Ransom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Marcinko and Jim Defelice <p> Published in October 2008 by Tom Doherty Associates
