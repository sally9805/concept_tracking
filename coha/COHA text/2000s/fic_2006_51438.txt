Ef Deal was the first person to get a library card at the age of five from the Audubon Public Library . A few decades later , she says " I am now a teacher , preacher , youth minister , writer , poet , and musician , and I have serious gourmet chef game . " With self-effacing humor , she notes that " I 'm currently almost published by most major editors , " but in fact her short fiction has appeared previously in The Fortean Bureau , Flashshots , and elsewhere . She gratefully acknowledges the help of her fellow writers in a nameless workshop in the Philadelphia environs . <p> WHEN A GUY LIKE CZESKO says he wants to get baptized , you know it 's going to be a weird night . <p> What , you get religion ? I says . Never mind , he says , just find me a priest and meet me at the bar . So I meet him here , right over there in that booth . I sit down and look at him , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . And it 's like nobody realizes it , just me . The bartender , he 's wiping a glass . People talking , people drinking . Nobody sees him , but there he is . Jeez , Czesko , I says , what happened to your face ? Never mind that , he says . You find me a priest ? Czesko , I says , are you dead ? Czesko says , maybe . <p> Maybe nothin ' . I can see what 's left of him is kind of blue but white , like it 's blue under his skin , and that 's dead all right . Just like Nicky Two-Foot that night we - well , never mind that . Czesko , I says , you get whacked ? He do n't answer . He says , where 's the priest ? I got ta get baptized right away . Me , what do I know . I 'm thinking it mighta been a good idea to get baptized before you die , but then here 's Czesko and he 's dead but he ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he says , baptism works after you 're dead too . I read it . First or Second Contusions or one of them . Me , I do n't know no Bible and I ai n't gon na argue with no corpse , and you know Czesko , so I tell him I 'll take him to a priest . <p> No , you ca n't do that , he says . I ca n't go to no church . What are you talking , I says . How the hell you gon na get baptized if you ca n't go to no church ? They can baptize you anywhere , he says , and I got ta be baptized here . Czesko , I says , this ai n't no place for no priest . But no , he wants a priest , so I get on the phone . Call up St. Aloysius , tell ' em I need a priest for a baptism . Now get this , the priest at St. Al 's says he do n't do baptisms . He does christenings . I says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got ta be Catholic to get christened by a priest . Czesko says he do n't give a damn and get his ass - ' scuse my French - over here to the bar with some holy water . The priest hangs up on me . <p> Czesko , I says , c'm on , let 's go down the street , they got a Methodist church down there . Maybe the Methodist priest 'll do a baptism . You ai n't listening , he tells me , I ca n't leave this place unless I get baptized . And you know , with Czesko being dead and his face half gone , that kind of makes sense a little , like ghosts who never leave where they kick it . see , you 're smiling so you know what I 'm saying . I says , okay , so I 'll go see if the Methodist priest will come to the bar . No no , Czesko says , you ca n't leave now , you got ta call him and get him here . Why ca n't I leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got whacked . Trust me , he says , you ca n't leave . I says screw that and I walk out the door , only I do n't . I mean , I go through the door but I end up back in here . I feel like an ice pick just cut into me , all cold and stabbing . Czesko , he just shakes his head like I 'm stupid or something . <p> What the hell you get me into , Czesko , I says . <p> Czesko sits back in the corner and looks at me , which freaks me out a little since he only got one eye now . He says , you ever do any muling ? But I do n't mule , see , ' cause I do n't wan na get into no drug wars . Them people are nuts . Yeah , Czesko says , but I hooked up with worse than nuts , dealing worse than the usual shit . Says he met this guy who knew a guy outta the old country . That 's like Poland maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lusitania . Okay , do n't believe me , but I 'm telling you what Czesko says . And they said they needed a mule and Czesko , he needs the money so he says he 'd do it . So he makes the pickup , only Czesko gets greedy , right , and he figures he 'll take a little snort for himself . Only it do n't taste right , and it do n't do nothing . He figures he got some bad shit , but he do n't care if he gets paid the same . He gets to the airport and the plane takes off , and you know , you get up in the air like that , your ears start fogging up , so Czesko tries to yawn to pop his ears , and that 's when he realizes he ai n't breathing . <p> I says , jeez , Czesko , how can you be not breathing and not be dead ? But I told you it was a weird night , did n't I ? <p> Now Czesko 's a cold kinda guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he whacked Nicky-hell , when he whacked Nicky 's dog-Czesko just plugs ' em , we dump ' em , and next minute he 's eating a cheesesteak Whiz with , just like that . So when he finds out he ai n't breathing , he do n't get upset or nothing . He goes into the men 's room , breaks the mirror , and slices his wrist . I ai n't kidding . Sure enough , he ai n't bleeding . I swear , he showed me his arm , sliced open , just this black kinda tar . Now I'da been nuts , but Czesko , he 's just really pissed . He gets this idea that maybe he 's hooked up with something weird , you think ? And now he 's got ta tell them guys he jacked a hit of whatever it is done this . And maybe they know what 's going on and maybe they can put him back , or else he got ta stay dead . But then he thinks about it and figures there 's maybe advantages to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more dead than dead . You can do a guy and even if he 's shooting back , you ai n't gon na die again . <p> So he lands and he 's gon na meet his contact but by now he 's this dead color , and people are looking at him . So he calls the guy and says meet him here , ' cause here , nobody really looks at you . He takes the booth so 's he can hide better , but he do n't order nothing ' cause he got all that shit in him and he thinks maybe if the bags get wet , if he drinks something , ' cause it ai n't the usual carry , it might , you know , really do some permanent damage . Now you 're smiling , so I know you 're thinking like me , it do n't get more permanent than dead . Well , guess what . <p> The guy comes in . He 's like a suit , real money . And he 's carrying this dog , one of them little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads . No lie . Three heads . Two of them 's asleep . Anyways , long story short , the guy takes one look at Czesko and knows what he done , so the dog bites his head off . Part of it , anyway , ' cause like I said two heads was asleep . Czesko pukes up the rest of what he 's muling , but the guy says he ai n't paying on account of what Czesko done . Czesko figures that ai n't fair so he pulls a gun and shoots the guy . Except the bullet disappears and now the guy 's pissed so he says something like , " You have stolen that which makes life to continue . You wished perhaps to prolong your time ? Your wish is granted , to your eternal damnation ! " <p> I know , it do n't sound like no curse , " your wish is granted , " but you see what I mean , eternal damnation and all . And Czesko points to the clock and I see it 's stopped at 10:03 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I check my watch . It says 11:28 , which is what it was when I come into the bar , only now it ai n't moving . I says , Czesko , the clock stopped . There 's people in this bar . Do n't these people know what 's going on ? The bartender , he 's still wiping that glass . The people , they 're just talking and drinking , but you know , they still got the same drinks . And Czesko figures because they ai n't involved , they do n't even realize what 's going on , they 're just stuck here in a limbo , but he figures him and me know better so we get to move around a bit and get to think up a way out of this . <p> So Czesko figures this guy must be into some kinda black magic , some sorcery maybe , and he needs a baptism so this guy 's curse is wiped out . God and the church and all that . I says , okay okay , I get it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cursed , so unless we can get somebody to come in and lift the curse off Czesko , nobody can go out , and maybe holy water and a baptism will do the trick . Yeah , that 's it , Czesko says . So I make the call . <p> The Methodist do n't wan na come to no bar , but I tell him it 's an emergency . I tell him a guy 's soul is at stake . You know , I give him a story , a guy in a bar , wants to be baptized in the bar , like that way he wo n't go to bars no more . And he buys it . So this Methodist pastor-they do n't call them ' Father ' when they 're Methodists - he shows up about a half-hour later , maybe . I do n't know ' cause time was stopped . <p> Now , this pastor takes a long look at Czesko , a long look like , what is this . And you can see him kind of fall down , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stuff him in the booth , and him just staring at Czesko and not saying nothing . Listen , I says , you got ta baptize him and save him . Otherwise , I 'm gon na put a hole in your head , and I ai n't sure that 'll kill you , if you get what I 'm saying . And it takes a minute before the pastor can even say something , but he says okay and he takes out a little bottle of holy water and a big clam shell and he pours the water in the clam shell and he takes out a little tiny bottle of oil . Then he starts in with this ritual . <p> Do you remunerate the power of Satan , and let Jesus tone down your sins , and do you show contraction for your sins and will you hold up the church , and all this stuff he says . Czesko says yeah yeah . Then the priest dips his hand in the water and he ai n't sure whether to pour it on Czesko 's head since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures he 'll sprinkle it over Czesko 's face . <p> Shit , says Czesko , ' cause where the water drips , his face starts melting . Okay , not melting exactly , maybe burning . Like with acid , which I kind of guessed was gon na happen but I did n't wan na say nothing in case I was wrong . But I was n't . It was pretty disgusting , these holes in his face , you know , and that with half his head gone anyway . And the Methodist lets out a howl , you know , like James Brown except not so much soul as wetting himself , and tries to scram out of the booth , and I let him go because sure enough , he runs out the door and he 's right back here , and that 's when he fainted . <p> Shit , says Czesko again . We 're gon na need a Baptist . <p> And I know what he means . We got ta dunk his whole body like they do in that pool . I says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he says , you get the priest , I 'll get the pool . So I call around and finally find a Baptist priest-they call them pastors too-and he agrees to come to the bar , and he comes and he takes one look at Czesko and starts shouting . <p> Out , demon , he yells , and get thee behind Satan , and I cast thee out , and shit like that . I finally smack him upside the head and tell him sit down and shut up . Listen , I says , this here 's a damned soul and if you do n't baptize him , we 're all damned , you got it ? <p> Meanwhile Czesko kicks over the refrigerator and dumps it on the floor . We look around . Bartender wiping the glass , people talking , drinking . Nobody notices . He fills the fridge up with fizz using pitchers from the bar because the hose from the bar do n't squirt that far . Then he stands next to it . C'm on , let 's get to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't gon na baptize a demon . I put a gun on him , and he says he do n't care , praise God , he 's ready to die for Jesus . So I tell him , look at the clock , but he do n't get it . So I say , okay , pal , you go ahead and leave . And he does but he do n't , you know , just like the Methodist , so it finally dawns on him . He finally figures out he 's stuck baptizing Czesko whether he likes it or not . <p> So there 's this refrigerator pool full of seltzer water , and Czesko standing next to it , and this Baptist pastor guy . He starts in pretty much like the Methodist , you know , and it comes to it , and Czesko steps into the pool . Then he starts yelling and cussing . I mean he 's mad as hell . And he jumps out again and falls right over ' cause , damn , he 's got no feet . Knees down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's weird is still nobody notices . Clock stopped and all . <p> I pick up Czesko , like a baby . He 's got tears now , real tears . Put me in , buddy , he says . He looks me dead in the eye , no pun , I swear it , and I realize he knows what 's what and he means it . I say , Czesko , buddy , I ca n't do it . Luvva God , he says , put me in , let 's end it . I look at the pastor , he looks at me , he looks at Czesko , and he gives me the nod . Name o ' the Father , he says , Son and Holy Ghost , he says . Do it . <p> So I step into the refrigerator and I lower Czesko in . Slow . Face first . The water starts bubbling . Not just fizzing , like seltzer , and not hot , just bubbling . Hissing , like . Steam rising . Czesko 's face is gone . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over like one of them Jacuzzis at the gym . Steam all over . Ca n't see nothing . I feel him slip outta my arms . Czesko , I yell , Czesko , where are you , buddy ? Water 's boiling like mad , huge clouds of steam . I lose my balance and fall outta the refrigerator right on my ass , pardon my French . Whack my head on the bar going down . Takes me a second to see straight , and when I get up again , what the hell you think ? <p> Czesko 's bones is sitting up in the empty fridge . He looks up at me and says , shit . <p> The Baptist guy , he 's sitting on a booth seat there , his head between his knees kinda moaning , oh God , oh God , oh God . Jeez , Czesko , I says , only one thing left I can think of . Czesko says , go for it . So I take his hand and snap it off and throw it in the big blender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make margaritas in . I put it on pulverize , and the blender fills up with bone powder . <p> Damn , Czesko says , that 's brilliant ! Do the other one ! So I dump the powder into a Ziploc from under the bar and bone by bone I pull Czesko apart . Hip bone connected to the groin bone and all that . Piece at a time , into the blender , into the Ziplocs . Some I got ta run through the ice chipper first ' cause they 're too big , but I get it all in . Last is his head . <p> Look , he says , this magic . It 's in my bones . You got ta be careful with this shit so you do n't end up dead like me . Ca n't let nobody get hold of it . No problem , I says . I 'll dump it , you know , like ashes . Someplace nice . Czesko gives me a smile . I mean , I know them skulls always look like they 're smiling , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're the best friend I got . And ' scuse me if I got ta wipe my eyes , but damn it , that was Czesko , you know , and it breaks me up I had to do him like that . He says , I hope to God for your sake this does it . I says , me too . <p> Then into the blender he goes . But before I put my finger on the button , I figure if this works , the bar 's gon na go back to normal , see , and folks are going to wonder about this fridge on its side and all the stuff on the floor . So I put it all back to rights first . Czesko says , that was pretty smart . And I say , thanks , Czesko . Then I hit the button . <p> Right away I feel it . The clock starts moving again . There 's that feeling again , that cold ice pick stabbing . The Methodist wakes up , takes one look around , grabs the Baptist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what . He do n't come back . I done it . I broke the curse . Me and Czesko . I dump what 's left of Czesko 's head into the last Zip-loc . I pack the whole bunch of him into my coat pockets and I plan to bury him , you know , like spreading the ashes except it 's not ashes so much as white powder that may or may not make a guy dead , but not dead dead . In fact , I was just on my way out to dump him when you came busting in . <p> So before you go dipping your finger in there , I swear to you , detective , these ten bags is Czesko . <p>
