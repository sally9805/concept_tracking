<p> Josh Volpe has heard legends about the perks of his position , but he 's never had time to experience them . He 's a record-setting senior quarterback for the undefeated football team at Northwest High School , and he calls his social life " almost nonexistent . " He 's never had a steady girlfriend . He avoids parties . Volpe turns 18 next month , and he has yet to obtain his driver 's license . <p> Volpe grew up believing the pop culture myth that playing quarterback facilitates the perfect adolescent social life . More often , he said , it actually inhibits one . Volpe spends about 40 hours each week under the direction of his football coach , usually practicing , playing or studying opponents . He tries to go out with friends one night each week , often after his games Friday nights . Even then , Volpe typically goes home early , since he has to report to practice Saturday morning at 7 . <p> His career has been indicative of a new reality in high school football : Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must manage a professionalized athletic schedule no longer reserved just for top prospects on renowned high school teams . Volpe 's average speed and unimposing physique have deterred recruiters , but he has compiled one of the most remarkable statistical seasons in Maryland history because he bought into what he calls the No. 1 rule of playing quarterback . <p> " Work at it all year , all the time , " said Volpe , who has thrown for 29 touchdowns and no interceptions for No. 4 Northwest , which hosts Gaithersburg in the first round of the playoffs tonight . " The season is pretty much continuous work . It 's not like you can be carefree . You 're under more pressure than anybody else . " <p> On Thursday last week , while most Northwest students congregated in a noisy cafeteria , Volpe brought two sandwiches , a Powerade and a Twix bar into a classroom on Northwest 's second floor . He settled into a desk in the center of the front row and readied for what some of his teammates call Football Class . Coach Randy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a film screen , which showed recent game footage of Northwest 's final regular season opponent , Richard Montgomery . When Trivers dimmed the lights , Volpe sat up in his desk and bit into his Twix . " The sugar keeps me awake , " he said . <p> Volpe had arrived at school at 6:55 a.m. , as Trivers requires every morning , so he could spend 30 minutes studying game strategies before first period . Then he had attended three classes in the morning before arriving here , at the varsity team 's daily sequestered lunch . The rest of Volpe 's day called for three more classes , followed by a mandatory , one-hour study hall for football players , followed by a three-hour practice , followed by a 30-minute meeting for quarterbacks , running backs and receivers . <p> During the football team 's 50-minute lunch , one of Volpe 's teammates launched a Milk Dud across the room that hit Volpe in the head . He hardly noticed . Even Volpe 's teammates sometimes tease him for his focus and single-mindedness . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never missed a football commitment . On game days , he cradles a ball in his right arm during school . He made his bedroom a shrine to the Dallas Cowboys , from the deep blue carpet to the wallpaper to the comforter and bed sheets . " If you want to be a good quarterback , " Volpe said , " you really have to love thinking about football . " <p> It 's a mind-set many of his peers consider mandatory . Dunbar 's Nathan Bussey practices with his team until about 6 p.m. , and then goes straight to workouts with a personal trainer designed to improve his grip and arm strength . River Hill 's Daniel Hostetler runs through plays in his living room to keep them fresh in his memory , and he sometimes finds himself dreaming about them . <p> " You ca n't even go out during the season ' cause you 're so stressed and tired , " said Paul VI Catholic 's D.J . Mangas , who said he felt a little relieved when his private school season ended two weeks ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just wanted to sleep . " <p> Volpe 's coaches call him a throwback because of his uncomplicated , boylike devotion to the sport . Extensive weight lifting has made his 5-foot-10 , 175-pound frame appear almost stocky , especially in uniform . Famously impossible to fluster on the field , Volpe sometimes jams his hands deep in his pockets and blushes when girls approach him . His parents never gave him a curfew , because they ca n't imagine him needing one . <p> " Football keeps him in check , " said Jim Volpe , his father . " We know he 's not going to do anything stupid , because he cares too much about playing . " <p> Even though he takes three Advanced Placement classes and his unweighted , 3.71 grade-point average could earn him admission to most colleges , Volpe has limited his list of possibilities to schools where he could continue to play quarterback . He dreams of walking on at Towson , but he would settle for a Division III school . " I 'll go any place that has uniforms , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ football program to match his dedication . Trivers spent two years as a graduate assistant for Maryland before he applied to become the first football coach at Northwest , which opened in 1998 . He vowed to model his team after elite college programs . His players lift weights four times and run five times each week during the offseason . Each varsity player must sit in the front row of every class . <p> An English teacher , Trivers breaks down film until 1 a.m. , scripts the first eight plays of each game , laminates his team 's stat sheets and monitors weekly grade reports for more than 60 players  --  all for a coaching stipend of about $5,000 . <p> " If you do n't commit 100 percent , you ca n't be successful in high school football anymore , " Trivers said . " It 's like running a college team , but on a smaller scale . " <p> Trivers , 33 , led his team to a state championship in 2004 largely because he refuses to tolerate even the most menial distractions . During a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had not received their report cards because they had unpaid fines or outstanding library books . The coach shook his head and pounded his hand on his desk . <p> " I 'm telling you right now , I 'm not dealing with this crap next week , " Trivers said . " Get this taken care of . Now . Next week is the playoffs . It 's straight football . I 'm telling you jackasses , if you do n't get this taken care of , your practice Monday will be three hours of straight-up , physical torture . We will run you until you physically can not move anything in your body , with the possible exception of breathing . " <p> Northwest players respect  --  and sometimes adore  --  Trivers because his relentlessness makes them better players . Volpe transferred to Northwest from Washington Christian Academy after his freshman year because he wanted to play big-time high school football . He ran the 40-yard dash in an excruciating 5.4 seconds . " They called me bucket feet , " Volpe said , " because I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run track , and the quarterback gradually improved his 40 time to 4.7 seconds . Volpe lifted weights to improve the distance and speed of his throws . He met with receivers to play catch twice each week , even in February . " I just had to learn that Northwest football is a year-round game , " Volpe said . <p> What resulted is an eerily flawless senior season . Despite throwing as many as 30 times each game , Volpe has yet to throw an interception . His 29 scoring passes are believed to be a Montgomery County regular season record  --  the old mark of 25 was set by Einstein 's Rick Eisenacher in 1966 and tied by Sherwood 's Deontay Twyman last fall . <p> On the field , Volpe rarely scrambles . He stands in the pocket until the last possible second , unafraid of suffering a big hit . Volpe dislocated a finger on his throwing hand in a preseason practice , and he walked to the bench and asked Trivers to pop the finger back into its socket . Trivers refused , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was basically hanging off , " Trivers said . " Some of my guys would have milked that for at least a week off . " <p> Volpe returned from the hospital and rejoined practice in an hour . <p> Acumen is his greatest asset . He takes AP Statistics , Literature and Composition , and Honors History of the Modern World . And since he arrived at Northwest , he 's mastered an offensive strategy that includes possibilities for more than 1,000 plays and requires fluency in a complicated language . <p> For example , if Trivers calls for " Gun Spreads Tight Flip 190 Special H Leak Out of Jaguar , " Volpe knows , instantaneously : He lines up in shotgun ; two receivers stand on each side of the offensive line ; the slot receiver , who will drag across the middle of the field , should come open about four seconds after the snap . <p> " It has be to total instinct , " Volpe said . " You have to tune out all of the pressures and distractions . " <p> Before his final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this whirlwind , Volpe found it easiest to retreat . He sat on a bench in the locker room , bouncing his knees up and down , and stared at the wall in front of him . " I just go into my own zone , " he said . And it lasted through four touchdown passes in Northwest 's 53-7 win . <p> After the game , Trivers gathered his players around him . Volpe knelt at the front of the huddle , his eyes fixed intently on his coach . <p> " Undefeated . Ten wins , no losses . That 's one hell of an accomplishment , " Trivers said . " Enjoy it , but also know this : This success alone is unfulfilling . The work does n't stop now , men . The work never stops . And for the next month , we just work harder and harder . "
