<p> As it has throughout the debate over campaign finance reform , the Sun-Times again has criticized attempts to regulate the flow of money into our political system as an unnecessary restriction on political speech ( editorial , Jan. 26 ) . In past editorials , the Sun-Times has derided even the most rudimentary reforms , such as limiting soft-money contributions by corporations and unions . <p> The premises underlying this opposition are ( 1 ) that campaign contributions are a form of free speech deserving of protection , and ( 2 ) that full disclosure and a vigilant free press provide voters all the information they need to punish politicians who provide favors to contributors . Both are mistaken . <p> In equating money contributed to a political campaign with free speech , the U.S. Supreme Court ignores one of the fundamental characteristics of the rights that our Constitution protects : their inalienability . That is , these rights , acquired merely by becoming a citizen , can not be separated from the individual who acquires them . The free-speech guarantee contained in the Bill of Rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allowing the recipient to enjoy permanently more freedom of speech than the donor . But if I give my money to someone else , that person then can use the money to purchase more free speech than I can purchase . This can not be what the founders had in mind , nor can it be consistent with full civic participation in a world where incomes differ widely . <p> The benefits of full disclosure and a vigilant press are likewise overrated . How is full disclosure useful when so many contributors provide vast sums to both political parties ? Of the top 100 corporate soft-money donors in the current election cycle , more than half contributed to both parties . In a two-party system ( with numerous impediments to credible third-party candidates ) , this leaves no one for voters to punish . The vigilance of the press would be a more promising safeguard were it not for the direct participation of the press itself in making suspicious campaign contributions . For example , both the Sun-Times and the Tribune have made substantial soft-money contributions to the major political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Committee on Feb. 7 , 1997 , and the Tribune Broadcasting Company gave $ 25,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee on Mar. 8 , 1999 ) . <p> These contributions are particularly suspect because both the Sun-Times and Tribune are publicly held corporations . This means they have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders to make no expenditures that do not enhance the value of the corporation . There have been no reports of a revolt by the shareholders of either corporation , so it can be assumed that these contributions were seen by both shareholders and corporate officers as beneficial to the bottom line . So what have the Sun-Times and Tribune bought with their combined $ 40,000 ? They can not have bought simple corporate goodwill ( as corporations buy in sponsoring worthy charitable causes ) , because neither publication has advertised these contributions  --  if they were to buy goodwill , we would see the phrase " Proud Sponsor of the Republican Party " on each paper 's masthead . So what did they buy ? <p> Prodded by Theodore Roosevelt and popular disgust with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress banned direct contributions from corporate treasuries to candidates for federal office in 1907 . The logic was the same as that which makes corporate soft- money contributions suspect today : They could have no possible goal but the purchase of unwarranted influence . The participation of both of our city 's major newspapers in the soft-money scam that evades this reasonable restriction renders hollow their pronouncements on what level of restriction on contributions is in the public 's interest . <p> At the very least , we should close the loophole that makes these contributions possible . Even if reformers and the opponents of reform can agree on nothing else , they should be able to agree that corporate ( and union ) contributions have no place in our political process : As a matter of simple logic , they must be given for no reason other than to purchase influence . Banning them would infringe on no one 's right to unfettered political speech  --  corporate shareholders and union members would remain free as they are today to contribute to the candidates and parties of their choice . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limit on individual contributions should be set , but simply banning corporate and union contributions is a far more productive goal than the misguided focus on greater disclosure and the disingenuous faith in a vigilant press that the Sun-Times offers as alternatives . <p> Joseph P. Ferrie , <p> Department of Economics , <p> Northwestern University <p> Editor 's note : Professor Ferrie is correct about a Sun-Times contribution to the Republicans , in connection with a dinner in 1997 . The Sun-Times also gave in connection with the 1996 Democratic convention . <p> He told us so <p> Gov . Ryan recently apologized for what we now know was widespread corruption in the secretary of state 's office when Ryan was in charge . <p> There is someone he owes another apology to . Al Salvi , while running for secretary of state two years ago , made front-page headlines when he warned us that " corruption in the secretary of state 's office is widespread . " Ryan responded by attacking Salvi , who was ahead in the polls at the time . <p> In retrospect , Salvi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryan by saying at the time that it was n't Ryan 's fault , though his proposed " Operation Clean Sweep " had to scare Ryan to death . <p> Salvi 's silence after being proven correct on this issue is a testament to Salvi 's character . Ryan 's silence after being proven wrong on this issue is yet another testament against Ryan 's character . <p> Jennifer Siwicki , Palatine <p> Suffrage for nothing <p> What a shameful and silly statement Miriam Santos made when she blamed her pressuring the broker for a contribution on " PMS-ing " ( news story , Feb. 8 ) . That type of remark is a disgrace to all womankind and certainly is not a positive step in the further advancement of women 's gains in the political , employment or personal arenas . <p> If she is tough enough to want to return to her former position as city treasurer with the attitude that " if somebody has a problem with my management style , find the door , " she also should be tough enough to face the fact that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not saying that Santos is the only one who would stoop to putting the pressure on for money . It seems quite commonplace , if not a " requirement " for political positions . However , blaming her " bad day " on PMS completely contradicts her tough attitude and does nothing to further the advancement of women in the workplace . <p> K. Smith , Homewood <p> What decade is this ? <p> ( Miriam Santos ' comment about " PMS-ing " ) would be funny if it were n't also a throwback to the days when the generally held opinion was that women should not hold political office because of their hormones . Remember when people used to say that a woman president might  --  in the throes of PMS  --  set off The Bomb ? <p> The only reason Santos is not in jail today is because the judge at her trial screwed up . Overturning her conviction in no way means she is not guilty . She needs to be retried , reconvicted and rejailed . <p> In the meantime , she needs to shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign fund-raising methods . The future of women in politics may depend on it . <p> Susan Casey , Des Plaines <p> The Twinkie Variation <p> Miriam Santos now tells us how much stronger she is for having spent time in jail . Then she tells us it all was Mayor Daley 's fault . No , wait ! It is because she is a woman . No , wait ! She had PMS . Oops  --  no , that 's not it . She was rude . She did n't feel well . They were out to get her from the start . <p> Santos should shut up . She may be stronger , but obviously , no wiser . <p> Bill Margeson , La Grange <p> Bargain at any price <p> It is well known among car dealers and insurance companies that Illinois is an easy place to " wash " car titles . In plain language , the secretary of state issues good titles for cars that have been wrecked or " totaled " due to flood damage or other loss . Such cars are bought cheap at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well enough to be safe , and sold to an unsuspecting public . <p> Senate Bill 678 , sponsored by Senators Dianne Feinstein , Richard Bryan and Carl Levin and modeled on the Federal Odometer Fraud Act , would create a minimum standard that all states must follow in titling damaged vehicles . <p> Under this bill , a car 's title history must be disclosed to consumers before purchase . It has a clear , unambiguous definition of a nonrepairable vehicle : i.e. , one that has lost 90 percent of its market value . Vehicle Identification Numbers for such wrecks would be retired into a national database . This would stop car thieves from using them to get good titles for stolen cars . It also allows individuals to sue for violations of the law . The bill has wide support nationally , but the Illinois secretary of state and our own senators are quiet about it . <p> Sen. Trent Lott also has a bill that makes participation voluntary , allows title washing to continue and is supported by insurance and car dealer interests . Even AAA supports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as co-sponsors would be a good start at making amends for past , present and future fraud to the car-buying public . <p> Thaddeus J. Kochanny , <p> Ingleside
