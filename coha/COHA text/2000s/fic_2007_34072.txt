The Pig Scrolls By Paul Shipton Candlewick Paul Shipton SILENCE ! " roared the Sphinx . By now , the Sphinx did n't seem quite as calm as it had been at the beginning . Centuries-old rock rose and fell while the beast took a calming breath . " Here is your riddle , Answerer . . . . " It glared as if daring me to pipe up . " What creature walks on four legs in the morning , two in the afternoon , and three in the evening ? " What ? This was n't the sort of riddle we used to tell back in the service tents during the Trojan War . Riddles back then were more along the lines of : " Knock knock . " " Who 's there ? " " Euripides . " " Euripides who ? " " Euripides tunics and you 'll have to pay for them . " . . . You know , proper riddles , none of this bloomin ' " four legs in the morning " malarkey . I frantically searched my encyclopedic brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the corners . " Can I consult a friend ? " I asked in desperation . " I 'd best get going then , ' cause my friend lives four days ' march away . . . . " " Time is up , " said the Sphinx . " What is your answer ? " " Just give me a sec , will you ? It 's . . . um . . . " " Ye-es ? " I heard myself answering . My voice sounded small and faraway and a bit on the thick side . " Is it . . . a squirrel ? " I was faintly aware of Sibyl 's groan from behind me . The Sphinx 's face betrayed no reaction . " No , wait ! " I cried . " Not a squirrel . . . a chicken ! I mean . . . a hippopotamus ! " Still no help from that stony visage . " A camel ? A goldfish ? A parakeet ? Give me a clue at least ! " " Is that your final answer ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , I do n't know ! " I wailed . " The answer is a human , " declared the Sphinx . " A baby crawls on all fours . The child and the adult walk on two legs . Then , in the twilight of life , the old must use a cane - three legs . " The Sphinx 's stony lips shifted ever so slightly into what might have passed for a smile . " I can not accept your answer , " said the Sphinx . " Goodbye ! "
