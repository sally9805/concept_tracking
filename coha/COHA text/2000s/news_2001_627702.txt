<p> IT would seem to be the most fundamental aspect of the game , yet it remains a lost art in today 's NBA . If you want a mental challenge , try to unravel this intriguing mystery : Why ca n't NBA players shoot the basketball ? <p> The riddle of cold fusion will be solved before anyone figures out why the NBA has come to stand for National Bricklayers Association . <p> For proof of the league 's ineptness at this core part of the sport , just look at the games ( if you can ) . You would see Charlotte 's David Wesley knocking down a jumper with 16.6 seconds remaining , not only icing a Hornets victory over the lowly Chicago Bulls but putting his team at the 100-point mark , a rare occasion in the NBA these days . <p> But there should have been an asterisk next to the final score . Or three of them , since it took that many extra periods for the Hornets to reach the century mark against the league 's worst team . <p> Need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive talents like Latrell Sprewell , Allan Houston and Glen Rice , had back-to-back losses in which they scored 68 and 58 points . <p> But it is just another day in New York , where the Knicks long ago perfected the half-court wrestling approach to the game . The problem is that the entire NBA is playing that way and has been for a while . <p> Scoring has been spiraling downward for quite some time , with field-goal shooting dropping from 49.1 percent during the 1984-85 season ( when teams averaged 111 points per game ) to 43.9 percent this year ( when teams average 93.8 points ) . <p> Fans ca n't run away fast enough . It is rumored that instead of employing more traditional agonies like bamboo shoots under the fingernails or water torture ( or Kenny G ) , extremist groups now cue up a tape of Charlotte 's 65-56 victory over Miami , an excruciating game that featured 90 missed shots , or Toronto 's 93-72 win over Boston on Friday night in which each team scored nine points in the lowest-scoring third quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Miami 's ossified offense , the 29.2 percent field-goal shooting and 52 percent foul shooting in the former game stand out . <p> Nothing the NBA has tried - rules changes , enforcement of existing rules , moving the 3-point line - has worked . And none of the anticipated changes - shaving time off the 24-second shot clock or eliminating illegal defense rules - is going to rectify the situation , either . <p> Until the league addresses the fact most NBA players simply ca n't shoot the basketball , the scores will get even lower . <p> There are a few exceptions , such as Houston , Reggie Miller , Dell Curry , Dana Barros , Eric Piatkowski and Matt Bullard , but for the most part , shooting has become the great lost art . <p> Why ? <p> In an attempt to answer this perhaps unanswerable question , we broached the matter with four experts on shooting - former players Calvin Murphy ( 48 percent from the floor , 89.2 percent from the foul line in 13 NBA seasons ) , Mike Newlin ( 47 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 11 NBA seasons ) , Eddie Johnson ( 47 percent from the floor , 84 percent from the line in 17 NBA years ) , and Billy Keller ( 46 percent from the floor as the Indiana Pacers ' designated 3-point shooter , 87 percent from the foul line in seven ABA seasons ) . <p> They all agree today 's players simply lack the ability to hit a simple jump shot , and here are their theories as to why : <p> Most NBA players ca n't shoot because they never have needed to . <p> " I 've said all along that these guys ( NBA players ) are victims of their bodies , " Newlin said . " They 're so athletic and have spent all their time learning how to dunk and driving by people . It 's the testosterone thing to do . That 's the mentality . So players today become victims of their own talents , their own assets . " <p> Johnson , who was recognized as one of the purest jump shooters in the league at a time when sweet shooters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter Davis were playing , agreed . <p> " They 've never been taught the fundamentals of shooting , " Johnson said . " Since they 've been able to dominate athletically from high school through college , they have n't had to learn to do anything else . <p> " But now they get to the NBA , where athletic ability evens out , and they ca n't get to the rim and dunk or get layups anymore . Now they 're forced to take jump shots , with predictably horrible results . " <p> Players no longer put in the practice time working on shooting . <p> " I think that in today 's game , kids do n't really like to go out and practice shooting , " said Keller , who runs the Indianapolis-based Fast Break Basketball Shooting School and coaches the Indiana Legends in the new ABA 2000 league . " All they want to do is play . <p> " You 're not going to develop your shooting or develop your technique of being a better player just through playing . I think that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamentals , break it down and work on your skills day in and day out . " <p> Which is the way European players like Sacramento 's Peja Stojakovic ( Yugoslavia ) and Dallas ' Dirk Nowitzki ( Germany ) - two of the league 's top marksmen - have been brought up . <p> " Even if ( American-born players ) make the effort to work on their jump shot , they do n't know how to improve it , " Johnson said . " I watch guys all the time as they step on the floor before games , and they do n't understand . They 're not shooting shots they 're going to be taking in the game . You see big men out there shooting 3-pointers . It 's crazy . <p> " ( Michael ) Jordan worked on his game shots , and he got better , and that 's why Vince Carter is getting better . Look at Kobe ( Bryant ) . He went in the gym this summer and stayed in the gym three hours a day shooting jump shots . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these guys do n't understand that . " <p> Bryant , the league 's leading scorer , launched at least 300 jumpers a day . Like Jordan , the player to whom he is most often compared , Bryant now understands the value of the mid-range jump shot , because the 15- to 16-footer is always available in an NBA game since defenses are either packed inside or spread out to defend the 3-pointer . <p> So when a player exploits that middle ground , the results can be phenomenal , as the Suns ' Tony Delk proved in a 53-point assault against Sacramento . Delk attempted ( and missed ) only one 3-pointer in a 20-for-27 shooting night . Allen Iverson knocked down 20 of 30 shots in a 54-point night against Cleveland , taking mostly pull-up 15-footers off the dribble . <p> Yet few players are willing to put in the time to work on the mid-range jumper . <p> " You have to take hundreds and hundreds of shots a day , " Newlin said . " And not only shots - I would practice eight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one spot . I could absolutely monitor any variances in my shot . <p> " To this day , I could go out there and beat NBA players in a shooting game . I 'm not trying to brag . I 'm just telling the truth . And Calvin Murphy can say the same thing . " <p> Too many inexperienced players are being drafted . <p> " Look at all these young players who are coming out of high school and into the pros - they 're killing the game , " Murphy said . " Instead of learning the game in college and coming into the league polished , they 're now learning the game in the pros . That 's what 's killing a lot of the shooting percentages . <p> " The league is much younger now , and the players have not gone and gotten that four years of mature training ( in college ) where they are taught how to shoot . " <p> Keller agreed , comparing a talented basketball prospect to a gifted young musician . <p> " You do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , but that 's essentially what is happening ( in basketball ) , " he said . " These kids just play in games . If a musician plays nothing but concerts all the time , he 's going to continue to make the same mistakes . <p> " What you have to do is when the concert is over , you figure out what it was you did n't do very well and then you go practice that . Basketball players have to do the same . " <p> The 3-point line . Strange as it may seem , most real shooters despise the arc , saying the lure of the extra point is ruining the game . <p> " The worst thing that ever happened to shooters was the 3-point line , " Murphy said . " Because of the 3-point line , everybody 's out there shooting 30 percent . The middle-distance shooting , which is what we were accustomed to , is gone . The game has become 3-pointer , dunk and foul shot . Period . " <p> Johnson , who spent the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the 3-pointer the worst thing to happen to the NBA . <p> " You have the wrong guys shooting the ( 3-pointer ) in all the wrong situations , " he said . " That 's the problem . Back when it came out , the 3-point shot was used the right way ( as a game-winner or rally shot ) . Only the right guys took that shot . But the 3-point line is ruining the game now . <p> " I was a shooter , but I was n't a 3-point shooter . And if you look back at my career , you 'll see that . I did n't take a lot of 3-pointers until much later in my career . " <p> Coaches are strangling the game by running largely static offenses that consist of little more than isolations and two-man games while everyone else stands around watching . <p> " You can not be a great shooter standing in one spot , " Newlin said . " Part of being a great shooter is catching the ball on the move . You get the rhythm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . But the way the game is played today , you are now expected to do what the offenses are preventing you from doing ( shoot accurately ) . <p> " From a standing position , one of the hardest things to do is hit an outside shot . To be a great outside shooter , you need movement . But now the offenses are actually eliminating movement , but they 're demanding more from shooters . It 's an oxymoron . " <p> Johnson agreed . <p> " Coaches have a lot to do with the state of shooting in this league , and one of these days they 're going to have to own up to it , " he said . " It 's their philosophy on offense that has basically helped to push shooting back to the stone age . <p> " Until they ' fess up to it and understand it , that will never get cured . But these isolations and standing around watching two guys play basketball . . . it 's a joke . " <p> So what 's the solution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of the 3-point line , shooting will come back , " Johnson said . " All these guys will get off that line and come back to their range . And it will also make coaches coach rather than just putting the ball in the superstars ' hands and having everyone else get out of the way . <p> " Five guys would have to move the basketball around . Now defenses are tighter , and spaces are closer , which would promote picking and ( player ) movement . And when you have movement , you get more ( shooting ) opportunities . <p> " It becomes the NBA game of the ' 80s , back when teams were scoring 116 points a game and fans were griping , ' Oh , there 's no defense in that league . ' The fans used to ( embrace ) teams like Detroit and Cleveland , the ones that used to beat on you and slow the game down to a crawl . <p> " Guess what ? Those same fans now hate that style of play . " <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are plunging faster than the shooting and scoring numbers . Jerry Colangelo , chairman of the Phoenix Suns , hopes the league can be rescued from its offensive doldrums . <p> " If we have a more free-flowing game , where teams push the ball up the court and rely less on the half-court , all those things - scoring , percentages - go up , " he said . " We need to take a look at our game ; that 's all . We need to take a hard look at the rules , experiment with some things and then take some logical , constructive steps . <p> " I hope there are a lot of people in our league who will buy into it , because I 'm a strong believer that something has to be done . All the stats and the history you want are there . We need to juice up our game .

The riddle of cold fusion will be solved before philosophers arrive at the answer to why the NBA has come to stand for National Bricklayers ' Association . <p> For proof of the league 's ineptness at the most fundamental part of the game , we do n't need the grainy , out-of-focus photos that usually constitute " evidence " when it comes to flying saucers or ghostly apparitions . <p> Nope , the league offers us evidence every night in glorious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We see Charlotte 's David Wesley knocking down a jumper with 16.6 seconds remaining in the game , not only icing a Hornets victory over the lowly Chicago Bulls but putting his team at the 100-point mark , a rare occasion in the NBA these days . <p> But there should have been an asterisk next to the final score . Or , more to the point , three of them since Wesley 's shot came toward the end of triple overtime . Yes , it took three overtimes for the Hornets to reach the century mark against the league 's worst team , a game where the teams combined to shoot a mind-numbing ( and rim-bending ) 38.3 percent from the floor in a 102-95 victory . <p> Need more ? <p> The New York Knicks , who feature offensive talents like Latrell Sprewell , Allan Houston and Glen Rice , had back-to-back losses in which they scored 68 and 58 points . <p> But those were just another couple of nights in the NBA , a league whose the media guide should be subtitled " The Gang That Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bane of the league for more than a decade , with field-goal percentages falling from 49.1 percent in 1984-85 season ( when teams averaged 111 points a game ) to 43.9 percent this year ( with teams averaging 93.8 points ) . <p> Fans ca n't run away fast enough .

So players today become victims of their own talents , their own assets . " <p> Johnson , who was recognized as one of the purest jump shooters in the league at a time when sweet shooters like Larry Bird , Kiki Vanderweghe , Alex English , Purvis Short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing , agreed . <p> " One reason ( for the poor shooting ) that sticks out is that they 've never been taught the fundamentals of shooting , " Johnson said . " Since they 've been able to dominate athletically from high school through college , they have n't had to learn to do anything else . <p> " But now they get to the NBA , where athletic ability evens out , and they all of a sudden ca n't get to the rim and dunk or get layups anymore .

" All they want to do is play . <p> " You 're not going to develop your shooting or develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think that you have to go out and practice the basics , the fundamentals , break it down and work on your skills day in and day out . " <p> Which is what the European players do every day . <p> " The best jump shooters in the league are the foreign guys , " Johnson said . " That 's obvious . ( Sacramento 's Peja ) Stojakovic is the best jump shooter in the league , and ( Dallas ' Dirk ) Nowitzki is right behind him . It 's all foreign guys . They 're conditioned to shoot medium-range shots because that 's how the game is played in Europe . <p> " Even if ( American-born players ) make the effort to work on their jump shot , they do n't know how to improve their shot . I watch guys all the time as they step on the floor before games . They do n't understand . Any time you step on the floor you have to have a game simulation in your head . <p> " They 're not shooting shots they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have big guys who come out and start shooting 3s as their warmup shots . So they have no understanding of how to develop their fundamentals and how to develop their shots because they do n't practice game shots . <p> " That 's why ( Michael ) Jordan got better , and that 's why Vince Carter is getting better . Look at Kobe . He went in the gym this summer and stayed in the gym three hours a day shooting jump shots . That 's the only way you can improve , and a lot of these guys do n't understand that . " <p> The few who are willing to put in the time in the gym get a tremendous payoff on the court . <p> It has been well-documented how Kobe Bryant spent his summer locked in a gym , launching at least 300 jumpers . Like Jordan , the player to whom Bryant is most often compared , Bryant understood the value of the mid-range jump shot - the 15- to 16-footer that is always available in an NBA game . <p> There have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season - the Suns ' Tony Delk scored 53 points against Sacramento , attempting ( and missing ) only one 3-pointer in a 20-for-27 shooting night . Allen Iverson knocked down 20 of 30 shots in a 54-point assault against Cleveland , taking mostly pull-up jumpers off the dribble . <p> And Houston fans got an eyeful of Bryant , who knocked down 20 of 26 shots in a 45-point effort to lead the Lakers to a 99-94 victory over the Rockets . It is that mid-range pull-up jumper that has allowed Bryant to blossom into the league 's leading scorer this season . <p> Yet few players are willing to take , or work on , that mid-range jumper . <p> " You have to take hundreds and hundreds of shots a day , " Newlin said . " And not only shots - I would practice eight to nine hours a day and I would only shoot from one spot . I could absolutely monitor any variances in my shot . <p> " I would practice by myself , not with the distraction of other guys . And to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't see anybody who can shoot better than I can . To this day , I could go out there and beat NBA players in a shooting game . I 'm not trying to brag . I 'm just telling the truth . And Calvin Murphy can say the same thing . " <p> Too many young , inexperience players . <p> " Look at all these young players who are coming out of high school and into the pros - they 're killing the game , " Murphy said . " Instead of learning the game in college and coming into the league polished , they 're now learning the game in the pros . That 's what 's killing a lof of the shooting percentages . <p> " The league is much younger now and the players have not had a chance to go and get that training . They have n't gone and gotten that four years of mature training ( in college ) where they are taught how to shoot . College basketball was traditionally teaching time . " <p> Keller agreed . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid who 's a musical prodigy , " he said . " You do n't have a musical prodigy go around playing nothing but concerts all the time , but that 's essentially what the NBA is doing . Rather than practice , these kids just play in the games . <p> " If a musician plays nothing but concerts all the time , he 's going to continue to make the same mistakes . What you have to do is when the concert is over , you figure out what it was you did n't do very well and then you go practice that .

The middle-distance shooting , which is what we were accustomed to , is gone . Because of that , the shooting percentages have gone way down . The game has become 3-pointer , dunk and foul shot . Period . " <p> Johnson , who spent the final two-plus seasons of his career with the Rockets , is quick to correct people who labeled him a three-point shooter . <p> " I think the three-point line is the worst thing to happen in the NBA , " Johnson said . " The reason is because you have the wrong guys shooting the shot in all the wrong situations . That 's the problem . Back when it came out , the three-point shot was used the right way .

The Trail Blazers were making the Lakers look confused and overmatched . The Lakers were in desperate need of guidance , words from someone who has been there , who could settle them . <p> Phil Jackson offered none . He remained in what seemed some sort of mystical trance . He later explained that his zombie coaching technique was intentional to help his team mature or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week , they will again turn to Jackson to guide them . So far , he has been the problem more than the solution , the enabler feeding the apparent need of his players to behave childishly . <p> This is all Jackson really needs to do . He has Tex Winter to provide the triangle chalkwork . Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal - or is it Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant ? - are his all-powerful chess pieces . He ran out on any possibility of rebuilding the Bulls or taking on a project other than to coach the two most unstoppable forces in the league . <p> All he has to do is flash the six rings he brought to town with him and keep the marriage from falling apart . <p> So when Bryant and O'Neal - all right , O'Neal and Bryant - removed the subtleties from their verbal spitballs , they sounded like Jackson . The Lakers were humiliated by the Clippers . A bunch of bold Bryant quotes hit the magazine racks . And the Lakers championship heroes reacted by mimicking Jackson 's longtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> They matched him snide for snide . Jackson has spent the season publicly sticking it to both , and it sunk in . Not that it took much convincing , but he has convinced both that everything is the other 's fault . <p> Word quickly spread that in one vent session O'Neal asked to be dealt and in another heart-to-heart , Bryant and Jackson talked about a trade . <p> The dynasty that they all spoke of after their championship embrace last June began to crumble most publicly . <p> " I 've never been one to get into whose team it is but , clearly , when everything went through me , the outcome was playing with enthusiasm , the city was jumping up and down , we had a parade , " O'Neal said . " Now we 're 23-11 . So you figure it out . I 'm a proven commodity . Everybody knows what I can do . I know what I can do . <p> " . . . ( Last season ) worked out to the city 's , to the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would want to change , other than for selfish reasons . Last year was my first championship . We just need to go back to that . I 've always been known as a great-passing big man . So the problem does n't come from me . I do n't have a problem . " <p> It does n't take a Zen master or basketball genius to understand who " selfish " refers to . <p> " He obviously wants to go back to A.C. ( Green ) being here and Glen ( Rice ) being here , " Bryant said in his counterpoint . " It 's a different ballclub , a different year . We have new players . Things change . Things evolve . You just have to grow with that change . <p> " For the most part , Shaq delivers for us . There are certain things in the course of the game we do n't agree on - he 's a post presence and I 'm a wing presence - especially down the stretch when guys like to foul him all the time . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing wrong with our offense . Defense is what 's killing us . I think we have to improve as a basketball club in that department . " <p> The solution on the court is not complicated . Bryant needs to add patience to his gifts . His hunger for pre-eminence can grate on teammates . But he has been so spectacular , passing better and adding more control in recent weeks , that it all will come if he would more gracefully let it . <p> O'Neal by now must know he is the league 's most awesome force . He does n't have to prove it . He must get back to the sort of defense he played last season and not worry about his touches while his free-throw shooting is such an abomination . <p> But all that can and probably will happen , unless pettiness prevents it . <p> This is where Jackson is supposed to come in . <p> " I have n't had any thought of bringing them together , " he said , apparently for reasons we can not comprehend . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . <p> " . . . I 'm working on group therapy most of the damn time . " <p> It 's not working . This is why Jackson is there . It 's all he really has to do for his $ 6 million . No coach will pity him for this little speed bump . Last season , he found a team desperate to believe in him . Now , he must earn that faith . <p> AROUND THE WEST <p> Mailman deserves a break - It is understandable that the league wants its marquee names to attend its marquee midseason event . The event would be diminished if too many got away with skipping the All-Star Weekend to go fishing . Why should anyone treat the assorted dunk contests and exhibition games turned into dunk contests ( we wo n't even discuss 2-ball ) if the players wo n't ? <p> But it 's time to let Karl Malone go . Better to have Antonio McDyess smiling and sweating than another round of the disgruntled postal worker . <p> As usual , Malone has made it clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Malone reluctantly played in last year 's game - but only for three minutes . He declined to participate in news conferences the day before the game . When asked last Friday if he wanted to play in this year 's Feb. 11 All-Star Game in Washington , Malone tersely replied , " No . " <p> " I 've been like that for the last 10 ( All-Star games ) , " said Malone , a veteran of 12 NBA All-Star games and the Most Valuable Player of the game in 1989 and ' 93 ( co-MVP with Jazz teammate John Stockton ) . <p> Malone has said his sore back is fine , but he has never publicly admitted injuries . Malone stopped short of saying he would try to get out of going to the game if selected by the coaches , though that is no longer a lock given his recent slump . Tim Duncan , Kevin Garnett and Rasheed Wallace are all clear choices before Malone . Strong arguments can be made for Dirk Nowitzki , Antawn Jamison and McDyess . <p> " Obviously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game , " Jazz coach Jerry Sloan , a two-time All-Star player . " That 's why the fans get to vote . " <p> But the time has come for Malone to get his wish . <p> Crazy , crazy , crazy - The NBA will get Mark Cuban 's attention . It will find a way . <p> Cuban was slapped with another fine last week , $ 100,000 . That might seem tip money to Cuban . He laughed it off again , almost the way he bragged last week that the fines only bring more publicity and business his way . <p> This time , he played the victim , having been fined for sitting in the wrong seat . <p> " But I do n't understand this at all , " Cuban announced in an e-mail . " Crazy , crazy , crazy . " <p> The crazy , crazy , crazy thing , Cuban said , was about the fine , explaining that there were no open seats behind the bench and that he did n't want to take a seat from one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week after a league-record $ 250,000 fine Cuban drew for his criticism of the officials in a home loss to Detroit . His first fine was for $ 5,000 , then $ 15,000 , $ 25,000 . This week 's hit brings his tab to $ 395,000 . <p> If fines wo n't get Cuban 's attention , David Stern will . He can start with a game suspension , move on to a week suspension , make it a month and eventually a season . <p> If fines do n't shake Cuban , the league will find something that will . Stern does not lose a battle of wills . <p> Preparing to fly - The Spurs ' Avery Johnson 's hamstring injury is coming around . Either that or he 's going to become a butterfly . <p> " I 'm making what they call caterpillar progress , " Johnson said . " What does a caterpillar do ? He crawls . We are crawling . And if you know anything about a caterpillar , after he crawls , he goes into a cocoon . We 're not there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he comes out of the cocoon , right ? He flies . We hope to be flying in two to three weeks , but we 're still crawling right now . " <p> Unselfish to a fault - As much as any player , Timberwolves forward Kevin Garnett has stretches in which he appears capable of doing anything he chooses . One of these days , he said , he might choose to be the latest 50-point scorer . <p> If there is a criticism of Garnett , it has been that he can be too unselfish . He has seemed to be determined to establish the threat of his dominance and use it to set up teammates . <p> " Know what ? If I 'd get 50 and we 'd win , I 'd love it , " he said . " If I get 50 and we lose , I 'd be ( angry ) as hell . Points are not the big thing . The Ws are what make it . <p> " I 'm a winner , not a scorer . " <p> Garnett , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When his shot is n't falling , he works to get other teammates involved , be it feeding key assists or grabbing key offensive rebounds . <p> " . . . I 'm the first option , I know that . It 's not a cocky thing , it 's not nothing arrogant . But when someone 's got something going , I do n't want to take that away from him . That 's selfish . That 's not me . Because I do n't want you to take it away from me , know what I 'm saying ? " <p> . . . <p> AROUND THE EAST <p> Hot about Rod - If the Wizards could do the cap manipulations , they might be ready to deal Rod Strickland for a warm bucket of spit . The only thing that is n't clear now is whether they or he will lose their minds first . <p> Strickland was charged with driving intoxicated early Sunday morning in Northern Virginia , his third such arrest in as many years . He was acquitted of the first charge and pleaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has not played since Dec. 27 , when he played just 18 minutes against the Knicks because he missed practice the day before . On Dec. 28 , Strickland skipped practice , a doctor 's appointment and the team flight to Miami , earning a suspension for the Dec. 29 game at Miami . <p> After that game , Strickland started complaining of sore hamstrings and a sore left shoulder . He has had those pains for weeks but did not complain that they were too severe to play with until after his suspension . Wizards doctors found no significant damage that should keep him from playing . Strickland hired a private doctor and got second opinion on both injuries . That doctor found some minor tearing of muscle tissue in his left shoulder , giving Strickland an excuse to come back whenever he is ready . <p> The Wizards are hoping that someone would be desperate enough for point guard help to take him off their hands and give Washington back players in the last year of their contracts . Strickland is still in the second year of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 7.5 million until Feb. 3 , when it rolls over to the full $ 10 million . The Wizards could cut him , but if he is n't claimed off waivers , the Wizards would have to pay the rest of this year 's salary and the $ 5 million buyout , which it will exercise at the end of the season . <p> A trade seems unlikely . But while Strickland has been burning every bridge inside the beltway , his backup/replacement Chris Whitney is averaging 17 points and eight assists . He has become a fan favorite by playing more than 40 minutes a game on an ankle he sprained in the Miami game that Strickland was suspended for . <p> Passing the Buck - Bucks coach George Karl has done some politicking for Glenn Robinson to be selected to the All-Star team . The chances are not good . He is n't close in the fan voting . The chances are n't great that coaches will pick him . <p> " It makes me a little sad for Glenn because he 's had a great year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top seven or eight vote-getters is not a good statement . Right now , I 'd have to say Glenn is our MVP . I do n't know of any 3-man ( small forward ) out there playing better than him . There might be a few equal to him , but right now he 's having a great season and should be in the top two or three vote-getters at that position . " <p> Robinson is 15th in the league in scoring ( 21.9 ) . The only forward scoring more points than Robinson among the top 10 in voting is Toronto 's Vince Carter , who has more votes than anyone in the league . <p> But perhaps it has n't helped Karl 's cause that he keeps bashing Robinson 's team . <p> " We 're inconsistent , " he said in this week 's rant . " One night we do n't pass it . The next night we do n't defend . The next night we do n't run back . The next night we do n't shoot . We 're just not playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe I 'm just overreacting . We 're fortunate that we 're playing teams that do n't have a lot of firepower . We 're making plays down the stretch , but I just do n't see us playing 48 minutes of basketball . There 's always something with this team . " <p> It 's always the knee - Chris Mihm crashed and before he could bounce , the words ACL were passed ominously . <p> Mihm had played well , especially offensively , since Zydrunas Ilgauskas went out with his latest foot injury . But when he was hurt last Saturday , his season seemed over . He 'd been averaging 24 minutes , 10.5 points and 6.8 rebounds and shooting 52 percent ( 26 of 50 ) . <p> " I felt the knee go sideways , and I got scared , " Mihm said . " I did n't know what they would find . I 'm thankful it was not an ACL . I consider this to be a minor setback . It is a lot better than what it could have been . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Traylor and Chris Gatling inside . <p> " It is hard to tell how long he will be out , " Cavaliers coach Randy Whitman said . " It could take a week , two weeks or three weeks . It certainly did not look good watching the replays of it . Just when he returns will depend on how his body copes with this . " <p> . . . <p> Duncan realizes he was no Magic act <p> While the Magic continues its steady collapse , Spurs forward Tim Duncan came to town to remind of what could have been . <p> He might have been there because the Spurs had a game in town . But San Antonio 's game in town did remind how close Orlando came to landing the difference-maker Tracy McGrady is not ready to be . <p> " It was tougher than I thought it would be , " Duncan said . " I did n't think the decision would be that hard until I went to Orlando . I met a lot a good people there . ( Magic coach ) Doc ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams ) made it difficult . I went back and forth for a while . " <p> Duncan 's relationship with Spurs coach Gregg Popovich and his teammates played a role in his decision . So did longtime girlfriend ( now his fiancee ) Amy Sherrill - who was n't too thrilled by Doc 's no-girls-on-the-plane rule . But a last-minute visit by David Robinson , who flew in from his vacation home in Hawaii to meet with Duncan , saved the Spurs ' marriage . <p> " I just emphasized the strengths we have , " Robinson said . " When you have a team that has the ability to win a championship , you just do n't throw that away . A lot of teams work for years to get to the point . We worked for years to get to that point . That 's just not something to put aside . <p> " When I talked to him , I was very concerned . He was excited about the opportunity to play with Grant Hill and win the East . They did a great sales job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought we had a good , solid foundation . " <p> . . . <p> Rewinding the Human Highlight Reel <p> Consider Vince Carter 's , Kobe Bryant 's , even Michael Jordan 's greatest slams . Dominique Wilkins did them first and regularly . No one could more consistently finish with jaw-dropping rim-benders , in games , without breakaways . <p> The Hawks retired Wilkins ' No. 21 on Saturday , placing it with Bob Pettit 's and Lou Hudson 's retired jerseys . <p> " He was a great , great player , " says his former point guard , Magic coach Doc Rivers .

" We 'll have Black Hawk ready to go , and we have two other pictures we 'll get made prior to the strike . " <p> Even if strikes are avoided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movie industry to make up for excess inventory created by the accelerated schedule now in progress . <p> The problem may be more severe for the television industry , which may find it next to impossible to start the season in September or October , as usual . Shows are developed in the spring for " upfront " presentations in May , when advertisers preview and buy commercial time for fall . Then series go into production in late July and August . <p> The impact of a strike on Hollywood will be huge . One estimate is that strikes would cost Los Angeles $ 250 million a week , and that indirect costs would push that number as high as $ 1.8 billion a month . <p> " To me it 's as if the orchestra on the Titanic decided to start drilling holes in the ship just as the iceberg appeared , " said David Kissinger , president of Studios USA . " It really is tremendously self-destructive . " <p> " The impact is not simply with numbers of jobs that would be lost , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles , which would also be devastating , " said Peter Roth , president of Warner Bros . Television . " The real impact would be on the viewer . " <p> Writers and actors for shows already on the air are not in favor of providing networks a stockpile of shows now that can be run next fall - although there are a few exceptions . <p> So because networks will need to put something on the air , they are readying a slew of reality programs , are asking news departments to be prepared to ramp up magazine production , are talking about adding theatrical movies to schedules and are contemplating holding back midseason offerings . <p> A strike is exactly what the TV industry does n't need right now . It is already suffering from a downturn in the national economy and a soft advertising market , resulting in layoffs at NBC and CNN . Worse , the industry continues to face a losing battle with audience erosion as people turn to the Internet , cable and video for entertainment . <p> A strike would only accelerate erosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was struck , by writers in 1988 .

" Those were put in as a stop-gap measure at that time , and they 've lasted and taken away programming that used to be scripted hours or half-hours . The same thing is going to happen here . I can envision a scenario where very little gets on the air that is n't already on the air and successful . There 's going to be fewer rooms in the hotel .

And if they work , will they come back and change their schedules once the strike is over ? " <p> WGA officials are scheduled to meet with studio executives Jan. 22 , but the sides are so far apart that a quick resolution of issues seems unlikely . The WGA seeks increases in residuals from Fox to equal those of ABC , NBC and CBS ; increases in cable , foreign , video and DVD residuals ; and such creative rights as writer access on sets ( this demand galls the Directors Guild of America ) . <p> SAG/AFTRA members , who ended an 11-month strike against advertisers in October , reportedly are unlikely to meet before March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solidarity in last year 's strike leaves the impression they will not be easily mollified . <p> " The strike showed that SAG and AFTRA had a lot more solidarity than people expected , " strike activist Marshal Silverman told the trade industry publication Variety . " It means we 'll be taken more seriously in 2001 . " <p> Studio chiefs address the subject of a strike with caution . <p> " Nobody is digging in their heels and disavowing any kind of compromise , " Kissinger told the Television Critics Association . <p> " A prolonged strike trickles down from the networks to the suppliers to the talent itself , " said Tom Mazza , president of Columbia TriStar Television . <p> " The point is n't about the legitimacy of either side , " Roth said . " The point is the impact it will make at a time we can least afford it . It 's lemmingslike behavior on both sides .

Although they have more to lose , they commiserate because many of them have gone through periods of unemployment . ( They also are less likely to suffer from strikes because of fuller bank accounts . ) <p> " If there 's a strike , I 'll be on strike , " said Thomas Gibson , star of ABC 's Dharma &; Greg . " It does n't work otherwise . " <p> But not everyone is eager to stop work . <p> " I know that everybody I talk to is hoping to avoid this thing , " said William Petersen , star of the CBS series CSI : Crime Scene Investigation .

" <p> If there are strikes , television will proceed with whatever shows it can muster . <p> " Of all the networks , we 're situated very nicely between news and sports and the movie franchise we have and what has been for years a deep reality bench , " said Lloyd Braun , co-chairman of the ABC Entertainment Television Group . " The one rule we 're trying to live by is not to develop or put on the air any show we would n't otherwise put on the air .

What is a " life sentence , " anyway ? Sentenced to life for aggravated assault and then 45 years for taking a human life , this menace to society should never get out .

That means Mancusi-Ungaro is leaving an institution she loves , a department she created and the environment in which she forged an international reputation . <p> Mancusi-Ungaro has the distinction of being at the top of a field that 's seldom visible and is little understood by the public . Conservation is roughly equal parts science and art history , demanding knowledge of chemistry , the hands of a surgeon , the sensitive eye of the artist - and , one might add , the patience of a saint . The restoration of the Sistine Chapel , which involved more than 20 years of inch-by-inch cleaning , is a prime example . <p> But conservation is something that every work of art requires if it is to remain healthy , and Mancusi-Ungaro 's work with modern art has set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was living in Galveston doing free-lance conservation when Houston 's legendary art patron Dominique de Menil called her in 1979 . De Menil wanted to discuss discoloration of the large Mark Rothko paintings in the Houston chapel that bears his name . Determining the cause and finding a solution piqued international interest , given the reputation of the American artist - who had died less than a decade before and whose work is represented in nearly every major museum . <p> " I told Mrs. de Menil no one knew how they were made and how to treat them , and she said , ' Well , find out , ' " Mancusi-Ungaro recalled . " It exposed her to the idea that conservation was 50 percent research . And the challenges of the paintings set the tone for this department . " <p> Appointed chief conservator to the Menil Collection in 1983 , Mancusi-Ungaro 's investigation of the Rothkos launched her on a long voyage . <p> " I had been rooted in ideas about painting that did not apply to modern painting , " she said . " Trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a new way to deal with conservation . " <p> Understanding the concept behind Rothko 's paintings was crucial to understanding what needed to be done . The 14 large-scale , somber but luminous artworks include seven " black-form " paintings - black rectangles painted on a dark maroon ground that also forms a border . The other seven paintings are a deep plum color . They work in unison to define the chapel 's meditative interior . <p> " My fear was that if I treated one ( of the black-form paintings ) , the other six would look different . And that was not acceptable . " <p> Essentially , an element in the egg emulsion Rothko had used in preparing his pigments had percolated to the surface , producing a whitening effect . Discovering that , however , took years of painstaking experimentation in the conservation lab , chemical analyses done in collaboration with Shell Oil laboratories and interviews with Rothko 's assistant , Ray Kelly . The multifaceted process defines Mancusi-Ungaro 's approach and is integral to the department she 's headed . <p> A thorough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but so is his or her intent . To understand the latter , Mancusi-Ungaro began videotaping interviews with artists , a practice since adopted by similar archives around the world . <p> " It is my task to gain insight into the physical life of paintings . Obviously , the best source is the painter . That is why I started interviewing artists , first the older artists whose work we have in ( the Menil ) collection , such as Jasper Johns , Robert Rauschenberg , James Rosenquist . " <p> She introduced her program to an international audience in 1998 in a symposium at the Netherlands Institute for Cultural Heritage . The summary published at the symposium 's conclusion identified her approach as a departure from standard conservation methods in several ways . Most important was that she " emphasizes questions of meaning and tries to establish a sense of the artist 's viewpoint towards the preservation of his art . " <p> Contemporary artists experiment with media in a huge range , from the impermanent inks of digital prints to technology that may become obsolete for organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Understanding their intent and their concerns is increasingly important , Mancusi-Ungaro said . <p> For example , consider an artist who created a video with the Beta format . How do you preserve that video ? Does the artist want it preserved ? Or , if the original work is a CD , do you transfer it to DVD ? <p> At the Whitney , Mancusi-Ungaro will establish the museum 's first conservation department , reporting to museum director Maxwell Anderson . Her appointment comes with a $ 5 million grant from New York 's Robert W. Wilson Foundation . <p> " Her appointment caps the process of refining and strengthening the Whitney 's focus on its collection , " Anderson said . " With some 12,000 works , it no longer made sense to solely outsource the care-taking of ( the collection ) . " <p> The new center will be housed in a building being designed by Renzo Piano , architect of the Menil Collection . <p> At Harvard , Mancusi-Ungaro will conduct research and establish an archive , working closely with graduate students . <p> " Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials used by Old Masters , " she said . " It made sense to have the same kind of archive for modern art . " <p> " Carol has been a pioneer in researching the materials and techniques of modern artists , " said James Cuno , director of the Harvard University Art Museums . " Her work on the paintings of Pollock , Rothko , Newman and Twombly , among others , forms the basis for any understanding of their achievement as painters and is a perfect complement to Harvard 's tradition of technical research into the art of earlier eras . " <p> Mancusi-Ungaro leaves the Menil at the end of this month and assumes her new posts April 1 . She will live in Manhattan and commute to Cambridge , Mass. , two days a week . With a son and daughter enrolled at Yale University and family in Connecticut , her professional and family lives will be much easier to manage . <p> " Carol 's basic research and conservation of art mediums of the 20th century will remain an important contribution , " said Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Houston . " And I think she had a lot to do with raising the standard for conservation in Texas . She is a very generous colleague , willing to share information and assist in any way she can . " <p> " Carol was the first person I spoke to when we began to consider the Sam Houston monument , " said Artie Lee Hinds of the Municipal Arts Commission , who initiated the city 's conservation of public art . " She was helpful and encouraging . We 're losing a magnificent conservator and a wonderful person . " <p> TYPE : - LINKS-  ; Biography
