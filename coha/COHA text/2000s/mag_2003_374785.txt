In the fall of 1928 , Walt Disney could claim three dubious assets : a new animated cartoon character called Mickey Mouse , three short silent films featuring the spunky rodent and an idea greater than perhaps even he imagined  --  adding sound tracks to his little films . <P> What he did n't have as he wandered New York City with one of those films , Steamboat Willie , tucked under his arm was cash or clout . He was just an unknown 27-year-old animator from California who needed musicians and sound-effects guys to record a score  --  and a distributor to promote his product . <P> It was seemingly an impossible dream . A year earlier Warner Bros. had released the first ( partial ) talkie , The Jazz Singer , and the movie biz was in a tizzy . The Al Jolson movie was awful , but the man sang and spoke . A long-sought miracle had arrived . Unfortunately , the camera , heavily blimped to prevent its whirrings from being recorded , was immobilized . Movies could talk but could no longer move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His animators ' drawn images were as free as any in movie history . It was relatively easy to plan music , effects and dialogue so that they could be synched to the imagery . For example , all a conductor had to do was follow the beats Disney 's people had marked on their work print . Even so , Disney had to spend a good deal of his dwindling capital getting a musical director to follow those cues . Then he had to spend several weeks lurking around screening rooms , trying to get Willie seen and heard . <P> To no avail . At which point enters legendary press agent Harry Reichenbach , master of old-fashioned ballyhoo ( he had once faked a star 's kidnapping to promote a film ) . Reichenbach was managing the Colony Theater in New York City , and he advised Disney to appeal directly to the public . Give me your little movie for a two-week run , he told Disney , and I 'll give you $1,000 and make your mouse famous . The producer was dubious but desperate to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , on Nov. 18 , history happened . There were bigger stars on the Colony 's stage and screen , but Steamboat Willie got the press . Crowds created near mob scenes as they rushed to see this " riot of mirth . " In truth , it was crude stuff . But Mickey turned a cow 's tail into a hurdy-gurdy handle , and it mooed music as he cranked away . Another bovine 's teeth became a xylophone on which he beat out a tune . In short , Willie had what its more pretentious competitors lacked  --  energy and freedom . And its creator was on his way to fame , riches and immortality .  --  By Richard Schickel
