R. Dani Bolognesi still remembers the afternoon in 1994 when one of his research colleagues , Tom Matthews , ran into his office at Duke University with some exciting news . While searching for something that might work as a vaccine against HIV , Matthews had stumbled upon a compound that blocked the AIDS virus from binding to  --  and thus infecting  --  healthy cells . " I remember it as if it were yesterday , " says Bolognesi , now CEO of the company he co-founded to explore the compound 's commercial potential . " He said , ' You 're not going to believe this . I 've got something that 's blocking fusion ! ' " <P> It turns out that the compound Matthews identified does n't work as an AIDS vaccine , but it may still make a very good AIDS drug . It belongs to a family of molecules known as entry inhibitors that , as the name suggests , prevent HIV 's entry into healthy immune cells . While none are yet available in pharmacies , they are probably the most promising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , Trimeris , based in Durham , N.C. , collaborates with Hoffman-LaRoche and is already in the final stages of human testing with one compound and in the earliest phases of testing with a second . Other biotech firms , including Progenics Pharmaceuticals in Tarrytown , N.Y. , are right behind it . Progenics currently has two compounds in human trials . Together , these drug candidates represent a sophisticated new generation of antiviral compound  --  drugs born of a better understanding of how HIV works , at the molecular level , inside the body . <P> Entry inhibitors , for example , include at least three families of potential drugs designed to block key steps in HIV 's entry into a cell . Scientists know that in order for HIV to establish an infection , it first needs to make contact with the right cells . They also know that HIV binds very quickly to a particular section on the surface of a type of immune cell known as CD4 . You can think of these points of entry as windows or doors into the cell ; in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery the virus needs to reproduce itself ) , HIV has to find and pick the lock . To do this , it links simultaneously to an adjacent section on CD4 known as a cytokine receptor . Once the virus has bound to both CD4 and the cytokine , chemical changes take place that alter the structure of the cell 's membrane , and the lock is " tripped . " Fusion between the virus and the cell occurs , and HIV is free to spill its genome into the cell and begin replication . <P> Trimeris ' compound , called T-20 , blocks the final structural contortion from taking place . For this reason it and a second candidate , T-1249 , are known as fusion inhibitors . Progenics has been testing a different type of entry inhibitor , a molecular decoy for CD4 whose job is to find , bind and lure HIV away from the real CD4 cells .
