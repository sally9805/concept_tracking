ALONG THE RIVER THE GRAIN ELEVATOR Sits in the shadows of an abandoned button factory and a dried-up creamery , and farther down , houses teeter over the bank on stilts . In sunny weather the houses look charmingly ramshackle , on overcast days depressingly tumbledown , and when floodwaters rise , lifting the houses from their braces and floating them downstream , they look like recklessly bad decisions . At the end of the row , two boys stand in Big Lou 's small yard . " We 're building a dam across the river , " the younger one says . <p> The older one huffs the way men do . A dam goes in the river . A river is dammed up . It 's a process , damming . The older one-James , who has renamed himself Jimbo-knows this , knows all kinds of stuff the younger one-Billy , content in his nickname-does n't . Jimbo straddles a bike adjusted for Billy 's stuffed-sausage limbs , not for his own longer , spindly legs . He grips the handlebars so that muscle and sinew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way left and all the way right , inscribing a small arc in the dirt . Jimbo listens to his young friend , and he huffs and he puffs and he spits and shakes his head : gestures of a disbelief he expects Lou to share . <p> Because Billy ca n't even get the plan straight . Earlier that afternoon they sat along the riverbank beneath Lou 's house . Billy had bought a roll of caps with his pool admission money , but they did n't have a gun , so they folded lengths of tape , cap upon cap , and smashed them between rocks . Each explosion produced a pop , a thread of smoke . Billy yelped and rocked on his knees with each pop . Jimbo looked at the smudge the gunpowder left on the rock . He rubbed it off with his thumb . There was n't even a chip . He spit into the river , watched the globule float and dissipate , and said , " Dam up the river and all this crap 'll be underwater . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see only Lou 's curling shingle roof . " All of it , " he said . <p> Billy , though he has nothing against the town where his father lives , has nothing for it , either , and the idea of lots of crap being underwater struck him as glorious . He listened to Jimbo 's idea , imagined living in a submerged cave , imagined his sister Cheryl and all her pool friends swept away in the flood he and Jimbo would create . The boys discussed their plan . <p> All summer the boys have skulked along the bank beneath the houses . Up the hill they 've sneaked into the creamery and smashed crusted , dusty bottles . They 've ridden daredevil back down toward the grain elevator , bumping over pop cans , rocks , limestone chunks , broken glass from beer bottles and button-factory windows , iridescent chips of discarded shell , and the brick , cinderblock , and mortar crumbling from the creamery 's foundation . They 've discussed methods of breaking in , blowing up , stealing from . All summer they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and though this was n't part of the plan , it 's as if everything-the day , the summer-has built to this moment , presenting the case to him . A stranger to Billy , Lou is n't someone he 'd talk to were it not for Jimbo 's presence . <p> But limbo may as well be a stranger to Lou , too , since Lou does n't appear to remember him from the Fourth of July party a week back . James Jameson Jr . is a boy who , unless he 's tying cats together by their tails and draping them over a clothesline , unless he 's setting fire to picnic tables or swan-diving off the bridge , is as undistinguished as debris tumbling under bike tires down to the river , lapped up in a barge 's undertow , settling into silt . And on this afternoon , watching Lou not remember him , Jimbo knows it . <p> Lou reclines in a deck chair , its plastic tubing stretched and dipping nearly to the ground . The night dispatcher at the state police thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , and now sits in sleepy contemplation of the boys and their plan , his squinting , sweaty face as impassive as a lizard 's in the swarming halo of gnats and mosquitoes . <p> Billy details the scheme to dam the river , a plan that in Billy 's rendering does not involve elements like drainage canals , concrete , and rebar , but scuba diving , explosives , and badgers . <p> " Badgers ? " Lou says . <p> " You know . With the teeth and the tail ? " Billy puffs his cheeks and holds his hands up like rodent paws . He pantomimes industrious gnawing and building . <p> Jimbo huffs again , spits . " You do n't mean badgers , you moron . " <p> " Badgers ? " Lou says . " You do n't need no stinking badgers . " <p> Lou says he has to get to work , and the boys head up the hill and away from the river , Billy walking , Jimbo on the bike , legs wide , pushing along with exaggerated heel-to-toe steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He finds Lou and his reclined , bearish body funny . The word " stinking " is hilarious . He could say it all afternoon . <p> Jimbo knows he will , too . " Shut up , " the older boy says . Nothing is going as planned , though Jimbo did n't exactly have a plan , crawling up the riverbank below Lou 's house . They were going to do something , he 'd told Billy . He did n't know what that something would be  --  bigger than pitching empty beer cans into the river , he 'd imagined , but not quite arson . What he did n't imagine was to be made fun of , which is how he interprets the phrase Billy will not stop repeating . The tone Lou used , the Speedy Gonzales accent , convince Jimbo that he was being made fun of , even though the words themselves are n't positive or negative , even though the comment was n't about him but Billy , who ca n't distinguish badgers from beavers . It bothers Jimbo anyway . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the hill . " We should egg his house . " <p> " We do n't need no stinking eggs . " <p> " Set a cherry bomb under his chair . " <p> " Do n't need no stinking ... you got cherry bombs ? " <p> Billy is dazzled by explosives : fireworks , caps , matches . He loves the sulfuric stink of gunpowder . Jimbo knows this . When Billy got back from vacation , he went on and on about Wisconsin Dells , on and on about the Tommy Bartlett Water and Thrill Show and everything that exploded during it . On he went to the point Jimbo was forced to say , " Big deal . I was at Lou 's on the Fourth . " He said it so his young friend would know he 'd never have anything over Jimbo . <p> At Lou 's , fireworks exploded . At Lou 's , James Jameson Sr. did n't notice or did n't care that Jimbo was the only kid at the party , or that Jimbo had snagged himself a beer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper lanterns . Jimbo crouched there , listening . From the deck chair , Lou told about a 911 from a guy who said his neighbor had died . Recently ? That day , in fact . And how did the caller know the neighbor was dead ? He would n't answer his door , and the caller could see him through the window , slouched in his chair . He could see the end of a gun barrel , too . Maybe the guy blew his face off ! Could the caller see his face ? No ! No , it was n't there anymore , or no , it was turned away ? Turned away . The police kicked the door in and were met by a shotgun blast that hit the sacred heart by the front door . " Goddammit , " the neighbor said . He thought it was that asshole from next door , come to steal his beer . <p> There was Jimbo , laughing just like the rest of them . He dispatched himself to the cooler for more beer for everyone and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each time he removed a can . He listened to the sizzle and thump of fireworks shot into the river . He could hear people start laughing again , and then he could hear his dad 's laugh still going when everyone else 's settled down . Lou said , " Let me make sure I 've got it straight , Jimmy . A can of tuna ? Is that what you 're telling me , Jimmy ? All over a can of tuna ? " And his dad laughed , " That 's what I said ! A goddamned can of tuna ! " <p> Jimbo cringed . He 'd heard the story before , something about a guy getting lost skiing up in Galena . Somehow , " a can of tuna " was supposed to be the punch line . Jimbo heard a woman laugh like a pig snorting , and for a second he let himself believe that she got his dad 's joke , that the story made sense , that it was funny . But when Jimbo met her eyes , she covered her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced the river . Jimbo was n't going to think about that ; he thought instead about the thickness of Lou 's fingers as he took the beers . He listened to Lou 's big laugh and felt included , in on something . He sat down to hear more stories . He forgot about the way Lou looked over at him and then at his dad . The way he smiled . <p> But now he remembers . Lou . Making fun . Pretending not to know him . " Thinks I 'm dumb as- " Jimbo says . He looks at Billy , who 's wringing his hands and looking at the crumbling building before them . " Thinks I 'm dumb as you . " <p> " With enough cherry bombs , we could blow up the whole stinking creamery . " Billy 's green-brown eyes are lit from behind , Roman candles firing under dirty water . <p> Sitting against the creamery foundation , Jimbo is in no mood for new plans , though the creamery is a young vandal 's dream , all glass and hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a broken window on the north side , hidden from the road , that they can sneak through when they want to . The glass in all the panes has flowed down , warped and bubbling at the sills . The light is cloudy through the smeared windows , and the creamery smells stale and sweet , of dust and rot . But the sound of breaking glass is clean and clear as the spark on a match head . Bottles smash into shards . Each shard , caked on one side with grime and the other with evaporated milk , has dangerous , virgin edges . The glass is too thick to see through from new edge to new edge , but Jimbo sometimes wonders if it will work like a magnifying glass . He could take a shard and hold it lengthwise up to the sun , imagining light intensified and burning through it . For the second it takes to smash a bottle , for the moment that the shatter rings off the brick walls , Jimbo sees himself sharp and clear as broken glass . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shadow , is to be like Jimbo . Last summer Billy Williamson did n't know Jimbo or the river or the spectacularly littered hill leading to it , but only the negligent eye of his sister , Cheryl , a straight path between his father 's house and the pool , and the wall at the shallow end where he parked himself , shoulders peeling , toes crinkling into prunes . The first summer visiting their dad , Cheryl had stuck with him , watched him . By the next summer she 'd made friends of her own . Billy threw up all over one of them on the Tilt-a-Whirl ; Cheryl 's life nearly ended . Now she does n't care what he does all day , so long as he 's home by dinner and tells their dad he spent the day with her at the pool . Now Billy roams with Jimbo . He spends his pool money on pop and candy and caps for them to share . He imitates Jimbo 's every move , so that the two boys have grown to look related , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bartlett , " Billy says . <p> Jimbo does n't say anything , and Billy grabs his bike from where Jimbo leaned it against the creamery . They reenact the Tommy Bartlett Show each afternoon , and now Billy tries out a Jimbo squint into the glare off the water as he describes what he 'll accomplish by putting a jet pack on the bike . He copies the older boy 's dismissive hand-flip at imagined doubts over his proposed stunt . He heads down the hill through red , white , and blue beams of spotlights . At the bottom he squeezes both hand brakes and drops his left foot , spinning his bike to fan gravel and dirt into the road . In the pose completing all their stunts - ramp jump , ring of fire , aerial spin-he stands frozen as debris showers down . He is not at all the whiny kid from last summer with his arms in water wings inflated tight like blood-pressure cuffs . <p> Jimbo has told Billy that his dad owns the creamery and that they 're helping get the bottles ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunny-hopping the BMX into a three-foot drop will not bend the forks . He has told Billy that it 's way better to go to the river than to the pool , and Billy believes it all . He loves the river . He loves his new life . But he ca n't tell anyone about it , because Cheryl has told him he 'll get the belt for sure if their dad finds out he was n't with her all day . Cheryl and his dad would think Jimbo was an imaginary friend , anyway . The daring Jimbo-vandal , thief , star of the Tommy Bartlett Water and Thrill Show-is far too good or far too bad to be true . <p> Lou drives by on the low road behind Billy . His horn plays " La Cucaracha . " Billy wishes he had a horn like that . <p> As Lou drives up the hill , Jimbo watches him acknowledge them  --  index finger lifted from the steering wheel , a nod that could be a nervous tic . Billy waves back . Jimbo does n't . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimbo 's dad , of Jimmy Jameson and the can of tuna . Tuna . Badgers . Lou is thinking Jimbo is a chip off the block , an apple at the base of the tree . But Jimbo is not James Jameson Jr . Jimbo refuses to be Jimmy , a kid-name that sounds silly and irresponsible attached to an adult , a dad . He 's not his father or his father 's son . That 's what he wanted to say to the clerk at Western Auto who caught him pocketing a handful of Atomic Fireballs . That 's what he should have said to his former second-grade teacher , who saw him flinging lit packs of matches into the dry grass and said , as if Jimbo were still sitting in the tiny desk with the lift-up top , " James , " drawing it out to a two-beat sigh of disappointment . He 's not James or little Jimmy , he should have told her . He 's Jimbo . Self-created . But that name is wrong , too . It sounds plump , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit . <p> Lou plays the horn again as he crests the hill . Jimbo hears Billy laugh . " No , really , " Lou said to Jimbo 's dad . " A can of tuna ? " Jimbo pictures Lou making fun over the dispatcher airwaves , lumping Jimmy and Jimbo together , lumping Jimbo together with Billy , who pushes his bike up the hill , muttering and giggling to himself like the moron he must be to be talked , as he so easily is , into letting Jimbo take one more turn on his bike . <p> The lifeguard has blown the whistle at the pool up the hill , dinnertime approaches , and Billy is crying that he has to go home , but Jimbo wo n't give him his bike back . " You do n't live that far , " Jimbo says , riding a circle around Billy , just out of the younger boy 's swiping , lunging reach . " Walk , if you want to go so bad . " He rides the brakes all the way down the hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll get the belt if I do n't come home with my bike , " Billy says , running after him . <p> " No , really . The belt ? You 'll get the belt ? " <p> Billy says nothing , stretches again for the handlebars . Jimbo tilts them away . " If you did n't cry , he would n't give it to you so much . " Jimbo 's told Billy a million times how he never gets the belt , and Billy is dumb enough to believe it 's because Jimbo is craftier and tougher than he and not because James Jameson Sr. is usually too drunk to handle anything as directed as punishment . <p> Jimbo rides in a figure eight near Lou 's gravel driveway . " Just say it got stolen . I 'll keep it for a week or so . Then you can say you found it . He 'll be proud of you . It 'll be fine . " Billy wings a handful of gravel , and Jimbo turns his face away just in time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you 'll get the belt for sure . " <p> " Give it , " Billy screams , pelting Jimbo 's back with shell shards and little pellets of mortar . Jimbo has refused to give the bike back before , long enough to make Billy consider the possibility of saying it was stolen , but never so long that Billy has imagined Jimbo would really do this to him . <p> Jimbo rides to the riverbank in front of Lou 's house . Billy follows . " Come on , " Jimbo says . " I 'm gon na show you something . Then you can go . " <p> He 's going to show Billy how he can climb onto the roof of Lou 's porch . Lou thinks he 's so smart , but Jimbo can climb up on his house whenever he feels like it , and Lou will never know the difference . " Come on , " he says , leaning the bike against the tree where the plastic lanterns still hang . He pulls himself onto the porch , feeling it creak and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will be easy to get up from there . <p> Through the window he sees Lou 's clean kitchen . He sees dishes on the drain tray . He sees how the enamel sink basin is n't stained with beer and coffee . He sees the flat , flowered covers over the stove 's burners . There 's no paper trash-sack on the floor . On the table he sees a pepper shaker and a round box of salt . Jimbo took the salt shaker on the Fourth , but he does n't have it now . He carried it around for days , the spilled salt melting in his pockets with the sweat off his palms . He poured it all into the river , told Billy they were making saltwater . He tossed the empty shaker as far out as he could , and it sank and was gone . <p> " Come on , " Jimbo says , pulling himself onto the roof . Billy does n't say anything , and Jimbo figures he 's just jealous . " Come on , " he says , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make it . " <p> He does n't even consider that for once Billy wo n't do what he tells him to , does n't think of this possibility as he stands triumphant atop Lou 's house , king of Lou , king of the river , king of the whole town , until he hears gravel scraping under tires and turns to see Billy pedaling away . <p> " Hey , " he shouts . " Hey ! I was going to show you something , and now you 'll never get to see it . You hear me ? Never ! " Because he could have shown him what the sky looked like from the roof . He was up there on the Fourth , after James Sr. had disappeared in the truck , after Jimbo had wandered through Lou 's house , picking up and putting back down an ashtray from the coffee table , the remote , the TV Guide , a Mason jar sitting by the sink , a bottle of shampoo in the shower . He 'd sat on Lou 's couch for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone upstairs and out a window and lain back , pressing half-moons into the warm , soft tar with his left thumbnail , watching the fireworks explode above him , so close , he thought , they could singe his eyebrows , burn all the hair clean off his head . Jimbo could have shown Billy the sky above the trees , the sky with no grain elevator , no power lines , so blank it could be anywhere-the roof of his own house , the other side of the river , Wisconsin . <p> Jimbo lowers himself over the edge of the roof , jumps off and runs to Lou 's shed . He breaks in through the window . So what if someone hears him ? Maybe Lou will get to dispatch a squad car to his own house . That 'd be a story for him . Tell that one at parties . Jimbo is going to do something . He 's thinking , more smashed glass ; he 's thinking , gasoline poured on the grass . And then he sees the ax , and then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to topple Lou and Billy and the name James Jameson Jr . <p> At first it 's like with the caps . He hits the wood and does n't seem to be doing anything at all ; he ca n't make a dent . Big Lou does n't even have a decent ax , and that about figures . But then he breaks through at the corner . The legs are spindly , splintery ; maybe termites have already set to work on them . He takes another stroke and another , and they 're solid . He swings again and again , and the porch begins to totter and creak . He is king of something . He 's David . He 's Jack . Then , just as he starts to make progress , the ax sticks , wedged under the falling weight . Jimbo pulls and pries . The house leans above him . Below , the leg has shifted in the ground , widening the hole where it is planted . The stilt wants to give way but does n't want to release the ax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He gets on the other side of the stilt , under the house , and kicks . He kicks and hears splinters pop . He backs up and runs and throws all his weight against the stilt , knowing this is babyish , something Billy would do if he wanted to take down a house . Try to kick it down . But it 's what James Jameson Jr . has been reduced to . He throws himself against the stilt again and again , and the wood gives and the ax is thrown free and Jimbo sees the softened , reddish pulp inside the stilt , the wood succumbing to dry rot long before he ever came upon it . <p> A house going down groans like a felled tree , slow and accusing . Billy hears it from halfway up the hill and knows he 's in trouble . He turns and sees Lou 's house pitch forward on one front corner , then the other , as if kneeling . The house goes into the river roof-first , the rear stilts kicking up , leaving deep channels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front of the house as it slides along the eroding bank , but Billy ca n't see him . It 's as if his friend has disappeared , shriveled like at witch , swallowed by the river . The noise does n't stop-glass breaking , wood popping , everything smashing down . Billy imagines his own collection of trucks and action figures back at his dad 's , crushed under a collapsing house . Gas hisses and ignites , and Billy wonders what Jimbo was going to show him . <p> Billy stands on the low road where the crowd gathers , watching firemen climb through the smoldering wreck . Billy loves sirens ; they are second only to explosions . But he will never be able to stand the sound of them again , just as he will never again go watch the fireworks . The house settles as Billy is interviewed , as rescue workers dig through the charred and doused wood and siding and shingles . He ca n't say anything . They treat him for shock , and his father is there . His father leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through contact with disaster , he is a new boy entirely . Untouchable . Cheryl , not Billy , will end up getting punished at the end of this day . Billy will remain silent . He wo n't tell his father or Cheryl or anyone any more than he told the police . He will go back to his mother 's . He will never visit the water again . <p> The others wo n't come back , either . Lou will move closer to his work and away from the river . Even James Jameson Sr. will drift off , find work on a barge , maybe , and good riddance to bad rubbish . But for a time the crowd will continue to gather , wandering down from the town , slowing our cars as we pass the burnt-out shell , lurking at the edge of the low road . We wo n't miss Jimbo or Billy or Lou . We did n't know them . But it would be hard to resist speculation , whether or not established motives matched our invented ones , whether there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we tell ourselves we saw it coming in the same breath we say there was no preventing it . For a long while we 'll puzzle and talk . It is like a mosquito bite , scabbed over . It itches and bleeds and crusts . When we stop picking , there will be new translucent skin . When we 've stopped thinking about it , we will look and the mark will be gone . It takes effort to keep a wound open long enough to produce an actual scar . <p>
