Feast of Saint Philomena , the Year of Our Lord 1456 <p> Lucrezia and Spinetta Buti arrived at the Convent Santa Margherita in early July , on Monday of the fourth week after Pentecost . They came in a simple carriage drawn by two fine horses that gave pause to all who saw them along the dusty road from Florence . Farmers who labored in the olive groves drew off their caps as they passed , and shepherd boys tending their flocks in the golden hills outside of Sesto Fiorentino waved , hoping a pale hand might toss coins , sweets , or small colored beads from the carriage . <p> Gleaming in the midmorning sun , the horses trotted through Prato 's main gates and whinnied as they slowed outside the convent . Prioress Bartolommea , sitting in her small study , squinted up over her account books . <p> " Who are we expecting ? " she asked Sister Camilla . " Is it the procurator ?

" Mother Bartolommea asked as the gates were opened and the carriage rolled into the courtyard . <p> " If it is , Madre , he 's not come at an appointed time , " said Sister Camilla , who stood and peered out the window . " Nor has he come in his usual carriage . " <p> The women crossed themselves and glanced toward heaven . Unannounced visits from Prior General Saviano , head of the Augustinian Order , were distressing : he rarely stayed less than four nights , ate heartily , and consumed more than his share of wine without replenishing the nuns ' meager supply . <p> " Perhaps it 's someone to see Fra Filippo , " said Sister Camilla . <p> " Perhaps , " the prioress said faintly . She patted the younger woman 's hand as she thought of Fra Filippo Lippi , the famed painter and monk . Despite her distaste for the Carmelite brother 's gruff voice and salacious reputation , the prioress brightened whenever he crossed her mind .

As they reached the church square , the monk put down his brush and hurried to the window . Sunlight fell on his features , revealing a strong mouth , heavy brow , wide Roman cheekbones , and deep blue eyes . The passing carriage was modest , and the monk saw quickly that it did n't belong to the Carmelite Order , nor did it bear banners displaying the Medici crest of six golden palle . Whoever it carried , the passengers were not coming to his bottega to demand past-due work or debts owed , and the painter was greatly relieved . <p> The horses turned the corner onto Via Santa Margherita and Fra Filippo went back into his cluttered bottega .

With his mind on his work , the man barely noticed the wooden panels stacked against the walls and filled with images of angels and saints and patrons in various stages of living , praying , or dying as they awaited the life that came from his hand . <p> Running a thick palm across his tonsured scalp , the monk stood before his easel and stared at the panel he 'd been laboring over for days . The painting was a commission from Ottavio de ' Valenti , Prato 's wealthiest citizen , and Fra Filippo forced himself to focus on this small portrait of the Madonna and Child . <p> " A Madonna . Una bella Madonna con bambino , " Signor Ottavio had requested , pressing ten gold florins into Fra Filippo 's palm to seal the commission . " For my blessed Teresa , now in attesa .

The cherubic Christ child was in her arms , looking up into the Virgin 's face . <p> But there was no face . There was only a light sketch in red crayon on a flesh-colored oval , awaiting the painter 's brush . <p> Slowly , the Buti sisters stepped from their carriage . The local boys who tended the convent 's barnyard animals stopped to watch , and the nuns within sight of the courtyard peered from under their wimples . <p> Spinetta , the younger of the two , came first . She was pale in her brown traveling cloak , but her cheeks still had their fullness , and wisps of blond hair framed her face . She kept her gaze on the ground as she moved aside to let her sister descend . <p> All eyes were on Lucrezia as her boot stepped from the carriage , followed by the hem of her bold magenta cotta , a gloved hand , a narrow waist , and a braided blond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her twentieth year , Lucrezia Buti was beautiful , with an eye trained for finery in the home of her father . Her features were placid and delicate : a high , smooth forehead , wide-set eyes , full lips . She stood by her sister , and raised her chin to look at the dusty courtyard . <p> Lucrezia took in the goats and boys , the limestone cloister walls , the fragrant bay laurels that stood beside the prioress 's study , the quiet solemnity of the convent yard . She saw the tight face of an old nun staring from a narrow window , shadowed by a younger , gape-mouthed nun with a large nose and thick , furrowed brows . <p> " Mother of God , " Lucrezia murmured . She brought a small linen satchel of dried flowers to her nostrils , remembering how her fingers had deftly sewn the crushed petals into the clasp of fabric on her last night at home . " Mother Mary , give me strength . " <p> <br> Continues ...          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
