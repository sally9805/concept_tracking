Is Rep. Jeff Flake the House 's John McCain ? <p> Insubordination was not exactly a hallmark of the DeLay era , so when two young Republican congressmen led a drive to force leadership elections and summarily toss Rep. Tom DeLay ( R-Texas ) from his majority leader post , it was a pretty clear sign that things had changed . Only a food fight in the House cafeteria could have better spelled out the end of DeLay 's once vaunted and feared iron discipline . No longer could he send dissident caucus members scurrying back into line with a withering glare or a threat to cut spending in their district . Now he was the one being told  --  and by upstarts !  --  that it was time to go . <p> Indeed , by January of 2006 , the entire Republican Party seemed to be in free fall . The increasingly unpopular president 's approval ratings were dimming prospects for the midterm elections . The Jack Abramoff scandal was casting a pall over Congress and K Street . Duke Cunningham was reciting mea culpas on television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Jeff Flake , a three-term congressman from Arizona , the moment was an opportunity and a bittersweet vindication . He later told me that for years he had worried about the entrenched spoils system that DeLay epitomized , warning his colleagues : " We 've got to change our ways , or this stuff is going to come back and bite us . " And sure enough , DeLay 's troubles were tainting the two hundred and some House Republicans not being investigated . <p> Seeing that Speaker Dennis Hastert ( R-Ill. ) was stalling and unconvinced that DeLay would make the responsible decision himself to step down from his leadership post , Flake forced the Hammer 's hand . With his moderate colleague Rep. Charles Bass ( R-N . H. ) , he circulated a petition that would require the Republican caucus to hold elections to select new leaders . <p> It was a risky move . At the time , most congressional Republicans were still sticking to the talking point  --  if no longer the sure belief  --  that DeLay would beat the charges . But underneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The petition got the 50 signatures it needed within a matter of hours . His first mission accomplished , Flake immediately began promoting his fellow Arizonan , Rep. John Shadegg , as a replacement for DeLay . He had stickers made up that read " SHADEGG=REFORM , " and passed them out around the Capitol as if he was managing a student council race . In the end , Shadegg did n't make it past the first round of voting . But the eventual winner , Rep. John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) , triumphed only after promising Flake and other reform-minded conservatives that he would push for institutional changes in the House . <p> Once again , a Republican from Arizona is making life difficult for his colleagues , marching to his own drummer . Flake , a self-described paleo-conservative ( " I prefer that to neoconservative , anyway , " he told me ) has been a thorn in the side of the GOP leadership since he was elected to Congress in 2000 . He has taken unpopular stands on subsidies ( working with Rep. Chris Van Hollen ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , immigration ( joining with liberals to support a guest-worker program ) , and lobbying reform ( voting against the recent GOP effort to go after 527s ) . Under the old GOP reign , such heresies would have earned a congressman swift exile . Over the past few months , however , Flake has seen his profile steadily rise . Boehner singled him out for praise in a Wall Street Journal op-ed about reform , columnists John Tierney and George Will have written approvingly of him , and Flake scored an op-ed of his own in The New York Times earlier this year . More surprisingly , Flake has won admirers on the other side of the aisle , earning points for honesty from the likes of Barney Frank and Henry Waxman . <p> The similarities with another maverick , Flake 's senior senator John McCain , are apparent . But McCain , like Barry Goldwater before him , has always been something of a loner . What makes Flake interesting is that he seems to be part of a group of conservative Republicans who have been pushing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say , to the vision of the 1994 revolutionaries . His current crusade , eliminating the anonymous spending measures called " earmarks " that are tacked onto bills and reports , has become a cause celebre among pork-hating legislators . And Flake has become a leading member of the conservative Republican Study Committee ( RSC ) , which now comprises more than 100 representatives . When Jeff Flake leads a revolt , he brings more than camera crews in his wake . And that may make it impossible for the GOP leadership-and the White House  --  to ignore him . Blocking the " Bridge to Nowhere " <p> Flake 's forebears were Mormon missionaries dispatched by Brigham Young in the late 19th century to scout and establish a settlement in Arizona for the pioneers who would follow behind them . William Jordan Flake and Erastus Snow founded the town of Snowflake where , nearly a century later , Flake grew up on a cattle ranch as the fifth of 11 children . <p> In early March , I visited Flake in Mesa , one of the rapidly growing suburbs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south of Snowflake . His one-story ranch house is at the end of a dusty street in a sun-bleached gated development ; it is surrounded for miles around by nothing but orange groves ; trailer parks , other developments , and churches , including the nearby Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints , where Flake , his wife , and their five children worship . <p> A tall , ruggedly handsome man with thick arms and broad shoulders , Flake was busy pruning a tree in his front yard with a manual wood saw when I arrived . He may not be literally settling territory the way his ancestors did , but Flake does act as an advance scout for many of his colleagues , testing out controversial positions and letting them linger behind until they 're sure it 's safe to join him . Rep. Jeb Hensarling ( R-Texas ) describes Flake as " the Mikey of the Republican Study Committee , " referring to the up-for-anything young star of old Life cereal commercials . " Any time there 's a tough or uncertain mission , call Flake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , as he outlines it to me , is nothing less than the dismantling of DeLay-ism , the spoils system by which the former majority leader achieved and retained power . " The Republican leadership basically said , ' We ca n't pretend to be small government conservatives anymore ; let 's just use the levers of power , ' " Flake says as we talk inside . " That 's been the M.O . to win elections  --  redistricting and passing out pork . That 's hardly a model for the future . " <p> As Flake sees it , the first step in returning his party to its conservative roots is to reform Congress by making it more difficult for politicians to slip pork projects into budget bills . " In 1994 , Republicans ridiculed Democrats for earmarks , and justifiably so , " he reminded me . " But we 've taken it to a new level and made it far , far worse . " That new level includes using earmarks to " convince " members to change their votes on key measures and to dole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untraceable . <p> Although his current proposal is just a first step to strip earmarks of their anonymity , requiring representatives to be identified with the funding they request , Flake would like to do away with the practice completely . That is not , it 's safe to say , a majority opinion in the Republican caucus . " I was at a meeting on earmark reform a few weeks ago , " he said , " and someone asked the question whether there 's a constitutional right to earmarks . " Shaking his head in disgust , Flake continued . " Most of the Republican caucus was saying , ' Yes . ' And then someone said , Well what do we do with the Democrats who oppose our earmarks ? The answer was , cut them off , of course . So I guess you only have a constitutional right to earmarks if you 're a Republican . It was one of the most surreal things I 've ever seen . " <p> It 's worth noting that earmark reform , though worthy , would n't by itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earmarks are particularly offensive to small-government conservatives , but they do n't play much of a role in sustaining the central dynamic of the Republican Congress : the outsized influence of corporate lobbyists on policy-making as manifested in the Abramoff , and , more openly , in the K Street Project . <p> Still , it 's hard to overstate the extent to which politicians on both sides of the aisle have come to see earmarks as their privilege , or even a necessary part of the job , another form of fundraising . A Republican who crusades to eliminate this perk , and who defends the rights of Democrats in the process , is n't setting himself up to make friends . Yet Flake 's commitment to the cause has made him a hero to fiscal conservatives . Rep. Bob Beauprez ( R-Colo. ) calls Flake " almost rabid in his passion for reform , " with obvious admiration . Whenever Flake stands up on the House floor , at least a few members hoot out " earmarks ! " <p> Far from avoiding confrontation , Flake seems to revel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican leadership . Last fall , he went after a pet project of Sen. Ted Stevens ( R-Alaska ) , the famous $223 million " Bridge to Nowhere " that would connect a small town in Alaska to a tiny island . Despite the hot-tempered senator 's threat that he would resign from the Senate unless he got his bridge , fiscal conservatives succeeded in killing the project . According to Roll Call , the RSC celebrated by screening a key scene from the movie The Bridge On the River Kwai , in which the bridge is blown up . " It 's Jeff Flake ! " yelled one of the RSC members as Alec Guinness 's character detonated the explosives . " It 's Don Young the Alaskan congressman shooting at me ! " Flake shouted back to a roomful of laughter . <p> But while his reform agenda has burnished Flake 's reputation in an unusual way for such a junior congressman , it has also made him a more visible target , particularly in election years . In an era when incumbents , especially Republicans , often run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His opponent won the endorsement not only of Mesa 's Associated General Contractors , but also of Flake 's own mayor by arguing that Flake , who refuses to request earmarks for his district , was n't bringing home the bacon . " That 's how the game is played , " Flake told me . " But when it came to the voters , they said , ' You go ahead , Flake . ' " Short-term memory <p> When we met in March , Flake was once again worried about the prospect of a primary challenger . But the fact that he 's even running for re-election is causing problems for him with some conservatives . When he first campaigned for Congress in 2000 , Flake pledged to limit himself to three terms , even though term limits were already falling out of fashion by that point . National Review writer John Miller wrote recently that while he admires Flake , " it is troubling to learn that he is now breaking a promise to serve no more than three terms .. A year from now , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D.C.  --  but I 'll also think a little less of him . " <p> Indeed , while it is his commitment to conservative principles that wins Flake praise across the political spectrum ( Barney Frank calls him one of the few " intellectually honest conservatives " and Henry Waxman labels him " a man of principle " ) , Flake 's critics argue that he is willing to quickly abandon his otherwise widely-touted principles when the moment suits him . On the term-limit issue , Flake says the importance of that movement has " just petered out . " Last year , he was part of a bipartisan group opposing the Patriot Act renewal , on the grounds that it threatened civil liberties . After working closely with , among others , Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( R-Calif. ) and Rep. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt . ) , Flake suddenly gave up the fight , according to Rohrabacher . It was widely suspected that he 'd cut a deal with the administration . " He can be inspiring or exasperating , based on whether he 's being true to his principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did what he could on the Patriot Act , and managed to move the administration on key provisions . <p> Still , it was Flake and his merry band of fiscal conservatives who once again tied up the House in April , staging a showdown with pro-earmark House appropriators . Forcing the majority leader to choose between the two sides , Flake asked Boehner to guarantee that his earmark provision would not be touched . In the end , Boehner remembered those who helped his rise to power . Flake got his wish and the powerful committee members were reduced to spinning their defeat as a " compromise .
