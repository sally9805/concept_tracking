Her cutting-edge evolving style inspires fashion trends everywhere . Here , Gwen Stefani speaks candidly about her evolution from offbeat rocker to chic sophisticate , her introduction to couture and why John Galliano made her cry // Her eyes cast toward heaven in one of her trademark **25;1114;TOOLONG poses , Gwen Stefani is feeling secretly jet-laggy as she mambos through Harper 's Bazaar 's photo shoot , where three security guards are on hand to monitor the glistening piles of jewelry that-these days-Gwen 's retrosexual looks seem to demand . Her hair is defiantly platinum , her eyelashes comb-ably thick and her mouth painted a subtle , meet-the-parents pink . As she dances to her first solo album , Love . Angel . Music . Baby. , No Doubt 's 35-year-old lead singer-songwriter shows she still has those wicked washboard abs and hard-won tummy dimples that Pilates instructors like to refer to as Apollo 's belt . Away from the camera , Gwen reverts to a delicate and vulnerable Fay Wray in the leathery palm of an upstairs couch . Hot coffee and Kleenex to dab away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Gwen 's very own ) lurks nearby . Gwen wastes no time kicking off her ' ' 70s-style suede rock-chick mules so she can wiggle those gunmetal-gray-painted toes . There has been little chance to take a load off recently . " I feel like I 've been running and running for the past two years , " says Gwen . " But if I get excited about something and the passion comes over me , then I ca n't stop myself . " Growing up in Anaheim-whistling distance from Disneyland-Gwen was something of a tomboy , whose parents always helped their kids whip up prize-winning Halloween costumes . Her father worked in marketing for Yamaha , but none of his four children was allowed to own a motorcycle . He did take Gwen to one of her first concerts : Emmylou Harris at the Palomino club . Her mother and grandmother always sewed their own clothes , and it was n't long before Gwen was stitching her own midriff-grazing , suspender-dangling stagewear out of bras , balloon pants and kilts . Going to all those industry awards shows at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gwen once said , and there was something Kabuki about that early crop dusting of face powder , those ballpoint eyebrows and the gash of red lipstick . ( She admits lipstick is the one thing she 'd pack for a desert island-with a toothbrush and toothpaste . ) Why all the trowel-applied makeup ? Gwen hired her first makeup artist in the ' ' 90s , " and I thought , He is so-o-o-o talented , " she says with a musical little giggle . ( Even in the course of regular conversation , Gwen has a talent for holding a note . ) " I was like , " This is great ! Put on more ! " It was high camp , but it worked for her , as did the henna and bindis , the rhinestone-studded bra straps , the pizza-guy undershirts with camouflage boy pants and that black headband . Just like Madonna , Gwen has a talent for keeping her fans guessing . And just like Madonna , Gwen was determined to emerge from the chrysalis of her 20s as a fashion icon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her edgy clothing line stacked with wacky-waistline pants , Old English-lettered sweaters and va-va-va-vintage-looking halter tops and dresses . But it 's true there has been something of a glorious transformation . That can perhaps be traced to Gwen 's yen for the kind of longevity that making movies can provide . " But , just to get a part , it 's so competitive , it 's crazy , " she says . Still , it never hurts to dress for the job you want . Gwen credits stylist Andrea lieberman , who collaborates on L.A.M.B. , for escorting her through the looking glass to the loot to be had on the Paris , London and Milan runways . At last year 's Golden Globes , Gwen 's street style gave way to a vintage Valentine gown , and there would be more magic red-carpet rides in her future : Cast as Jean Harlow in The Aviator , Gwen swans through an onscreen film premiere as if she had been born wearing diamonds , white satin and Leonardo DiCaprio on her arm . But even as she got busy selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her body . " If I had my laptop , I 'd show you pictures of me in eighth grade , " she says . " That 's the fattest I ever was . " Yoga did n't do it for her : " I 'm old school , " Gwen says . " I like to run around and sweat , jump rope , run three or four times a week . Before our greatest hits tour last summer , 1 started weights again . By the end , I got so buff , I thought I was a man ! " And now she 's even more buff than ever . One guesses her recent investment in the latest elliptical trainer- " Whooo-ooo ! That thing is hot ! " she says-is partly responsible . People are fixated on her incredible shrinking waistline and how they might replicate the feat , but Gwen says she 's tired of indulging the chatter : " I wish everyone would just shut up about it , but I understand why people want to know , because half of my conversations are about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day long . " Fashion has also been propelled to preoccupation now that Gwen has more of a bank account to speak of . In her latest single , " Rich Girl , " Gwen fantasizes about cleaning out a Westwood boutique in her Galliano gown . The David LaChapelle-directed pirate-themed video was inspired by a Vivienne Westwood ad from the ' ' 80s . " I am a Vivienne Westwood maniac ! " Gwen says . " She is so magic ! " Gwen remains big on the Westwood bustier , but it was Dior designer John Galliano who was drafted to create Gwen 's cream and pink wedding gown and her 2001 and 2002 Grammy dresses . She has called Galliano her muse and notes that they are both exercise obsessives . " John has a hot body , " Gwen observes admiringly . The first couture show she ever went to was Galliano 's . " I cried , " she remembers . Someone at the shoot suggests that the music be turned to something upbeat " so that Gwen wont get depressed . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what appeared in recent papers , it 's easy to assume that Gwen is feeling slightly peaked . In October , tabloids snitched that Gwen 's husband of two years , Gavin Rossdale of the grunge band Bush , had fathered a daughter ( now a teenage model ) before he met Gwen . London gurgled that Rossdale had always denied any dalliance with the child 's mother , which is why Gwen is now believed to be , quote unquote , devastated . There were even rumors that the Gavin-Gwen merger was in trouble . Gwen 's eyes drift when the subject of Rossdale comes up : " Anything you 've read about Gavin is not true . I do n't even like to talk about him because I 've gotten into so much trouble mentioning him in my interviews . Our marriage is so sacred that the idea of sharing it with the world , and people judging it , is just gross . " " They are dealing with this between the two of them , " says a source close to the couple . " But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gwen and Gavin remain very , very committed . " Once , after they had split up years ago , Gwen dyed her hair fuchsia , " because that 's what you do when you break up with someone , " she remembers , laughing . " I saw a poster of some ' ' 50s girl with cottoncandy-beautiful hair . " Instead , she ended up with a shade of flamingo she lived with for an entire year : Some fans had dyed their hair pink , too , and she reasoned it would have been cruel to turn up at concerts with her old meringue hairdo . " I look at it now , and I go " uccch , ' ' " she says softly , " but it so perfectly reflects exactly where I was , which was very unsure of myself . But if you read the lyrics of that record Return of Saturn , released in 2000 , they are some of the best I 've written in my life ! " Rossdale remains a constant inspiration . Gwen is always pillaging his closet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ des Garons and Yohji Yamamoto . " Gavin 's got really good taste , " she says . " I try to impress him , so when I go out to buy something , I think , Will he like it ? " she says , " because you want to look good for the person you are hot for . " Right now is the first time in a long while that Gwen does n't see her future . Gwen does want kids , and the backbeat of her debut solo single , " What You Waiting For ? " is a ticking clock : " Your moment will run out " cause of your sex chromosome , " the song chides . Gwen allows that having children might help restore some perspective : " I always say that my children are going to save me from my vanity . " But there 's some fear of the unknown , too : " It 's just like being engaged or married . People can try to tell you what it 's going to be like , and you can watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that 's kind of how it 's going to be with children . " With a house on the West Coast , in Los Feliz , and one in London 's Primrose Hill- " I feel super-duper lucky to have both , " she says-there is now the necessary square footage in Gwen 's life . She considers this : " Having children is going to be probably my biggest collaboration ever .
