The quaking , shaking symptoms of Parkinson 's disease afflict 1 1/2 million Americans . It can be slowed but not cured , which makes prevention all the more appealing . A new study , released in the Archives of Neurology , suggests that regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) such as ibuprofen offers some protection . About 44,000 men and 99,000 women were followed for 14 and 18 years , respectively . Researchers found that the risk of developing Parkinson 's was 45% lower among men and women who regularly used nonaspirin NSAIDs than among nonusers . Also last week a Parkinson 's patient was treated with an experimental gene therapy . Results probably wo n't be known for months .
