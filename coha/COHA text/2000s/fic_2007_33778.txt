One PANDEMONIUM " You 've got to be kidding me , " the bouncer said , folding his arms across his massive chest . He stared down at the boy in the red zip-up jacket and shook his shaved head . " You ca n't bring that thing in here . " The fifty or so teenagers in line outside the Pandemonium Club leaned forward to eavesdrop . It was a long wait to get into the all-ages club , especially on a Sunday , and not much generally happened in line . The bouncers were fierce and would come down instantly on anyone who looked like they were going to start trouble . Fifteen-year-old Clary Fray , standing in line with her best friend , Simon , leaned forward along with everyone else , hoping for some excitement . " Aw , come on . " The kid hoisted the thing up over his head . It looked like a wooden beam , pointed at one end . " It 's part of my costume . " The bouncer raised an eyebrow . " Which is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clary thought , for Pandemonium . He had electric blue dyed hair that stuck up around his head like the tendrils of a startled octopus , but no elaborate facial tattoos or big metal bars through his ears or lips . " I 'm a vampire hunter . " He pushed down on the wooden thing . It bent as easily as a blade of grass bending sideways . " It 's fake . Foam rubber . See ? " The boy 's wide eyes wereway too bright a green , Clary noticed : the color of antifreeze , spring grass . Colored contact lenses , probably . The bouncer shrugged , abruptly bored . " Whatever . Go on in . " The boy slid past him , quick as an eel . Clary liked the lilt to his shoulders , the way he tossed his hair as he went . There was a word for him that her mother would have used  --  insouciant . " You thought he was cute , " said Simon , sounding resigned . " Did n't you ? " Clary dug her elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the club was full of dry-ice smoke . Colored lights played over the dance floor , turning it into a multicolored fairyland of blues and acid greens , hot pinks and golds . The boy in the red jacket stroked the long razor-sharp blade in his hands , an idle smile playing over his lips . It had been so easy  --  a little bit of a glamour on the blade , to make it look harmless . Another glamour on his eyes , and the moment the bouncer had looked straight at him , he was in . Of course , he could probably have gotten by without all that trouble , but it was part of the fun  --  fooling the mundies , doing it all out in the open right in front of them , getting off on the blank looks on their sheeplike faces . Not that the humans did n't have their uses . The boy 's green eyes scanned the dance floor , where slender limbs clad in scraps of silk and black leather appeared and disappeared inside the revolving columns of smoke as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys swung their leather-clad hips , and bare skin glittered with sweat . Vitality just poured off them , waves of energy that filled him with a drunken dizziness . His lip curled . They did n't know how lucky they were . They did n't know what it was like to eke out life in a dead world , where the sun hung limp in the sky like a burned cinder . Their lives burned as brightly as candle flames  --  and were as easy to snuff out . His hand tightened on the blade he carried , and he had begun to step out onto the dance floor when a girl broke away from the mass of dancers and began walking toward him . He stared at her . She was beautiful , for a human  --  long hair nearly the precise color of black ink , charcoaled eyes . Floor-length white gown , the kind women used to wear when this world was younger . Lace sleeves belled out around her slim arms . Around her neck was a thick silver chain , on which hung a dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He only had to narrow his eyes to know that it was real  --  real and precious . His mouth started to water as she neared him . Vital energy pulsed from her like blood from an open wound . She smiled , passing him , beckoning with her eyes . He turned to follow her , tasting the phantom sizzle of her death on his lips . It was always easy . He could already feel the power of her evaporating life coursing through his veins like fire . Humans were so stupid . They had something so precious , and they barely safeguarded it at all . They threw away their lives for money , for packets of powder , for a stranger 's charming smile . The girl was a pale ghost retreating through the colored smoke . She reached the wall and turned , bunching her skirt up in her hands , lifting it as she grinned at him . Under the skirt , she was wearing thigh-high boots . He sauntered up to her , his skin prickling with her nearness . Up close she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under her eyes , the sweat sticking her hair to her neck . He could smell her mortality , the sweet rot of corruption . Got you , he thought . A cool smile curled her lips . She moved to the side , and he could see that she was leaning against a closed door . no admittance  --  storage was scrawled across it in red paint . She reached behind her for the knob , turned it , slid inside . He caught a glimpse of stacked boxes , tangled wiring . A storage room . He glanced behind him  --  no one was looking . So much the better if she wanted privacy . He slipped into the room after her , unaware that he was being followed . " So , " Simon said , " pretty good music , eh ? " Clary did n't reply . They were dancing , or what passed for it  --  a lot of swaying back and forth with occasional lunges toward the floor as if one of them had dropped a contact lens  --  in a space between a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Asian couple who were making out passionately , their colored hair extensions tangled together like vines . A boy with a lip piercing and a teddy bear backpack was handing out free tablets of herbal ecstasy , his parachute pants flapping in the breeze from the wind machine . Clary was n't paying much attention to their immediate surroundings  --  her eyes were on the blue-haired boy who 'd talked his way into the club . He was prowling through the crowd as if he were looking for something . There was something about the way he moved that reminded her of something ... " I , for one , " Simon went on , " am enjoying myself immensely . " This seemed unlikely . Simon , as always , stuck out at the club like a sore thumb , in jeans and an old T-shirt that said made in brooklyn across the front . His freshly scrubbed hair was dark brown instead of green or pink , and his glasses perched crookedly on the end of his nose . He looked less as if he were contemplating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way to chess club . " Mmm-hmm . " Clary knew perfectly well that he came to Pandemonium with her only because she liked it , that he thought it was boring . She was n't even sure why it was that she liked it  --  the clothes , the music made it like a dream , someone else 's life , not her boring real life at all . But she was always too shy to talk to anyone but Simon . The blue-haired boy was making his way off the dance floor . He looked a little lost , as if he had n't found whom he was looking for . Clary wondered what would happen if she went up and introduced herself , offered to show him around . Maybe he 'd just stare at her . Or maybe he was shy too . Maybe he 'd be grateful and pleased , and try not to show it , the way boys did  --  but she 'd know . Maybe  - -  The blue-haired boy straightened up suddenly , snapping to attention , like a hunting dog on point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the girl in the white dress . Oh , well , Clary thought , trying not to feel like a deflated party balloon . I guess that 's that . The girl was gorgeous , the kind of girl Clary would have liked to draw  --  tall and ribbon-slim , with a long spill of black hair . Even at this distance Clary could see the red pendant around her throat . It pulsed under the lights of the dance floor like a separate , disembodied heart . " I feel , " Simon went on , " that this evening DJ Bat is doing a singularly exceptional job . Do n't you agree ? " Clary rolled her eyes and did n't answer ; Simon hated trance music . Her attention was on the girl in the white dress . Through the darkness , smoke , and artificial fog , her pale dress shone out like a beacon . No wonder the blue-haired boy was following her as if he were under a spell , too distracted to notice anything else around him  --  even the two dark shapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd . Clary slowed her dancing and stared . She could just make out that the shapes were boys , tall and wearing black clothes . She could n't have said how she knew that they were following the other boy , but she did . She could see it in the way they paced him , their careful watchfulness , the slinking grace of their movements . A small flower of apprehension began to open inside her chest . " Meanwhile , " Simon added , " I wanted to tell you that lately I 've been cross-dressing . Also , I 'm sleeping with your mom . I thought you should know . " The girl had reached the wall , and was opening a door marked no admittance . She beckoned the blue-haired boy after her , and they slipped through the door . It was n't anything Clary had n't seen before , a couple sneaking off to the dark corners of the club to make out  --  but that made it even weirder that they were being followed . She raised herself up on tiptoe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stopped at the door and seemed to be conferring with each other . One of them was blond , the other dark-haired . The blond one reached into his jacket and drew out something long and sharp that flashed under the strobing lights . A knife . " Simon ! " Clary shouted , and seized his arm . " What ? " Simon looked alarmed . " I 'm not really sleeping with your mom , you know . I was just trying to get your attention . Not that your mom is n't a very attractive woman , for her age . " " Do you see those guys ? " She pointed wildly , almost hitting a curvy black girl who was dancing nearby . The girl shot her an evil look . " Sorry  --  sorry ! " Clary turned back to Simon . " Do you see those two guys over there ? By that door ? " Simon squinted , then shrugged . " I do n't see anything . " " There are two of them . They were following the guy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cute ? " " Yes , but that 's not the point . The blond one pulled a knife . " " Are you sure ? " Simon stared harder , shaking his head . " I still do n't see anyone . " " I 'm sure . " Suddenly all business , Simon squared his shoulders . " I 'll get one of the security guards . You stay here . " He strode away , pushing through the crowd . Clary turned just in time to see the blond boy slip through the no admittance door , his friend right on his heels . She looked around ; Simon was still trying to shove his way across the dance floor , but he was n't making much progress . Even if she yelled now , no one would hear her , and by the time Simon got back , something terrible might already have happened . Biting hard on her lower lip , Clary started to wriggle through the crowd . " What 's your name ? " She turned and smiled . What faint light there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows smeared with dirt . Piles of electrical cables , along with broken bits of mirrored disco balls and discarded paint cans littered the floor . " Isabelle . " " That 's a nice name . " He walked toward her , stepping carefully among the wires in case any of them were live . In the faint light she looked half-transparent , bleached of color , wrapped in white like an angel . It would be a pleasure to make her fall .... " I have n't seen you here before . " " You 're asking me if I come here often ? " She giggled , covering her mouth with her hand . There was some sort of bracelet around her wrist , just under the cuff of her dress  --  then , as he neared her , he saw that it was n't a bracelet at all but a pattern inked into her skin , a matrix of swirling lines . He froze . " You  --  " He did n't finish . She moved with lightning swiftness , striking out at him with her open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent him down gasping if he 'd been a human being . He staggered back , and now there was something in her hand , a coiling whip that glinted gold as she brought it down , curling around his ankles , jerking him off his feet . He hit the ground , writhing , the hated metal biting deep into his skin . She laughed , standing over him , and dizzily he thought that he should have known . No human girl would wear a dress like the one Isabelle wore . She 'd worn it to cover her skin  --  all of her skin . Isabelle yanked hard on the whip , securing it . Her smile glittered like poisonous water . " He 's all yours , boys . " A low laugh sounded behind him , and now there were hands on him , hauling him upright , throwing him against one of the concrete pillars . He could feel the damp stone under his back . His hands were pulled behind him , his wrists bound with wire . As he struggled , someone walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy , as young as Isabelle and just as pretty . His tawny eyes glittered like chips of amber . " So , " the boy said . " Are there any more with you ? " The blue-haired boy could feel blood welling up under the too-tight metal , making his wrists slippery . " Any other what ? " " Come on now . " The tawny-eyed boy held up his hands , and his dark sleeves slipped down , showing the runes inked all over his wrists , the backs of his hands , his palms . " You know what I am . " Far back inside his skull , the shackled boy 's second set of teeth began to grind . " Shadowhunter , " he hissed . The other boy grinned all over his face . " Got you , " he said . Clary pushed the door to the storage room open , and stepped inside . For a moment she thought it was deserted . The only windows were high up and barred ; faint street noise came through them , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelled like old paint , and a heavy layer of dust covered the floor , marked by smeared shoe prints . There 's no one in here , she realized , looking around in bewilderment . It was cold in the room , despite the August heat outside . Her back was icy with sweat . She took a step forward , tangling her feet in electrical wires . She bent down to free her sneaker from the cables  --  and heard voices . A girl 's laugh , a boy answering sharply . When she straightened up , she saw them . It was as if they had sprung into existence between one blink of her eyes and the next . There was the girl in her long white dress , her black hair hanging down her back like damp seaweed . The two boys were with her  --  the tall one with black hair like hers , and the smaller , fair one , whose hair gleamed like brass in the dim light coming through the windows high above . The fair boy was standing with his hands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied to a pillar with what looked like piano wire , his hands stretched behind him , his legs bound at the ankles . His face was pulled tight with pain and fear . Heart hammering in her chest , Clary ducked behind the nearest concrete pillar and peered around it . She watched as the fair-haired boy paced back and forth , his arms now crossed over his chest . " So , " he said . " You still have n't told me if there are any other of your kind with you . " Your kind ? Clary wondered what he was talking about . Maybe she 'd stumbled into some kind of gang war . " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " The blue-haired boy 's tone was pained but surly . " He means other demons , " said the dark-haired boy , speaking for the first time . " You do know what a demon is , do n't you ? " The boy tied to the pillar turned his face away , his mouth working . " Demons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air with his finger . " Religiously defined as hell 's denizens , the servants of Satan , but understood here , for the purposes of the Clave , to be any malevolent spirit whose origin is outside our own home dimension  --  " " That 's enough , Jace , " said the girl . " Isabelle 's right , " agreed the taller boy . " Nobody here needs a lesson in semantics  --  or demonology . " They 're crazy , Clary thought . Actually crazy . Jace raised his head and smiled . There was something fierce about the gesture , something that reminded Clary of documentaries she 'd watched about lions on the Discovery Channel , the way the big cats would raise their heads and sniff the air for prey . " Isabelle and Alec think I talk too much , " he said , confidingly . " Do you think I talk too much ? " The blue-haired boy did n't reply . His mouth was still working . " I could give you information , " he said . " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who shrugged . " Valentine 's in the ground , " Jace said . " The thing 's just toying with us . " Isabelle tossed her hair . " Kill it , Jace , " she said . " It 's not going to tell us anything . " Jace raised his hand , and Clary saw dim light spark off the knife he was holding . It was oddly translucent , the blade clear as crystal , sharp as a shard of glass , the hilt set with red stones . The bound boy gasped . " Valentine is back ! " he protested , dragging at the bonds that held his hands behind his back . " All the Infernal Worlds know it  --  I know it  --  I can tell you where he is  --  " Rage flared suddenly in Jace 's icy eyes . " By the Angel , every time we capture one of you bastards , you claim you know where Valentine is . Well , we know where he is too . He 's in hell . And you  --  " Jace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a line of fire . " You can join him there . " Clary could take no more . She stepped out from behind the pillar . " Stop ! " she cried . " You ca n't do this . " Jace whirled , so startled that the knife flew from his hand and clattered against the concrete floor . Isabelle and Alec turned along with him , wearing identical expressions of astonishment . The blue-haired boy hung in his bonds , stunned and gaping . It was Alec who spoke first . " What 's this ? " he demanded , looking from Clary to his companions , as if they might know what she was doing there . " It 's a girl , " Jace said , recovering his composure . " Surely you 've seen girls before , Alec . Your sister Isabelle is one . " He took a step closer to Clary , squinting as if he could n't quite believe what he was seeing . " A mundie girl , " he said , half to himself . " And she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " Clary said . " I 'm not blind , you know . " " Oh , but you are , " said Jace , bending to pick up his knife . " You just do n't know it . " He straightened up . " You 'd better get out of here , if you know what 's good for you . " " I 'm not going anywhere , " Clary said . " If I do , you 'll kill him . " She pointed at the boy with the blue hair . " That 's true , " admitted Jace , twirling the knife between his fingers . " What do you care if I kill him or not ? " " Be-because  --  , " Clary spluttered . " You ca n't just go around killing people . " " You 're right , " said Jace . " You ca n't go around killing people . " He pointed at the boy with blue hair , whose eyes were slitted . Clary wondered if he 'd fainted . " That 's not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person and talk like a person and maybe even bleed like a person . But it 's a monster . " " Jace , " said Isabelle warningly . " That 's enough . " " You 're crazy , " Clary said , backing away from him . " I 've called the police , you know . They 'll be here any second . " " She 's lying , " said Alec , but there was doubt on his face . " Jace , do you  --  " He never got to finish his sentence . At that moment the blue-haired boy , with a high , yowling cry , tore free of the restraints binding him to the pillar , and flung himself on Jace . They fell to the ground and rolled together , the blue-haired boy tearing at Jace with hands that glittered as if tipped with metal . Clary backed up , wanting to run , but her feet caught on a loop of wiring and she went down , knocking the breath out of her chest . She could hear Isabelle shrieking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jace 's chest . Blood gleamed at the tips of his razorlike claws . Isabelle and Alec were running toward them , Isabelle brandishing a whip in her hand . The blue-haired boy slashed at Jace with claws extended . Jace threw an arm up to protect himself , and the claws raked it , splattering blood . The blue-haired boy lunged again  --  and Isabelle 's whip came down across his back . He shrieked and fell to the side . Swift as a flick of Isabelle 's whip , Jace rolled over . There was a blade gleaming in his hand . He sank the knife into the blue-haired boy 's chest . Blackish liquid exploded around the hilt . The boy arched off the floor , gurgling and twisting . With a grimace Jace stood up . His black shirt was blacker now in some places , wet with blood . He looked down at the twitching form at his feet , reached down , and yanked out the knife . The hilt was slick with black fluid . The blue-haired boy 's eyes flickered open . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Between his teeth , he hissed , " So be it . The Forsaken will take you all . " Jace seemed to snarl . The boy 's eyes rolled back . His body began to jerk and twitch as he crumpled , folding in on himself , growing smaller and smaller until he vanished entirely . Clary scrambled to her feet , kicking free of the electrical wiring . She began to back away . None of them was paying attention to her . Alec had reached Jace and was holding his arm , pulling at the sleeve , probably trying to get a good look at the wound . Clary turned to run  --  and found her way blocked by Isabelle , whip in hand . The gold length of it was stained with dark fluid . She flicked it toward Clary , and the end wrapped itself around her wrist and jerked tight . Clary gasped with pain and surprise . " Stupid little mundie , " Isabelle said between her teeth . " You could have gotten Jace killed . " " He 's crazy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whip bit deeper into her skin . " You 're all crazy . What do you think you are , vigilante killers ? The police  --  " " The police are n't usually interested unless you can produce a body , " said Jace . Cradling his arm , he picked his way across the cable-strewn floor toward Clary . Alec followed behind him , face screwed into a scowl . Clary glanced at the spot where the boy had disappeared from , and said nothing . There was n't even a smear of blood there  --  nothing to show that the boy had ever existed . " They return to their home dimensions when they die , " said Jace . " In case you were wondering . " " Jace , " Alec hissed . " Be careful . " Jace drew his arm away . A ghoulish freckling of blood marked his face . He still reminded her of a lion , with his wide-spaced , light-colored eyes , and that tawny gold hair . " She can see us , Alec , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what do you want me to do with her ? " Isabelle demanded . " Let her go , " Jace said quietly . Isabelle shot him a surprised , almost angry look , but did n't argue . The whip slithered away , freeing Clary 's arm . She rubbed her sore wrist and wondered how the hell she was going to get out of there . " Maybe we should bring her back with us , " Alec said . " I bet Hodge would like to talk to her . " " No way are we bringing her to the Institute , " said Isabelle . " She 's a mundie . " " Or is she ? " said Jace softly . His quiet tone was worse than Isabelle 's snapping or Alec 's anger . " Have you had dealings with demons , little girl ? Walked with warlocks , talked with the Night Children ? Have you  --  " " My name is not ' little girl , ' " Clary interrupted . " And I have no idea what you 're talking about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of her head . You saw that boy vanish into thin air . Jace is n't crazy  --  you just wish he was . " I do n't believe in  --  in demons , or whatever you  --  " " Clary ? " It was Simon 's voice . She whirled around . He was standing by the storage room door . One of the burly bouncers who 'd been stamping hands at the front door was next to him . " Are you okay ? " He peered at her through the gloom . " Why are you in here by yourself ? What happened to the guys  --  you know , the ones with the knives ? " Clary stared at him , then looked behind her , where Jace , Isabelle , and Alec stood , Jace still in his bloody shirt with the knife in his hand . He grinned at her and dropped a half-apologetic , half-mocking shrug . Clearly he was n't surprised that neither Simon nor the bouncer could see them . Somehow neither was Clary . Slowly she turned back to Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in a damp storage room , her feet tangled in bright plastic wiring cables . " I thought they went in here , " she said lamely . " But I guess they did n't . I 'm sorry . " She glanced from Simon , whose expression was changing from worried to embarrassed , to the bouncer , who just looked annoyed . " It was a mistake . " Behind her , Isabelle giggled . " I do n't believe it , " Simon said stubbornly as Clary , standing at the curb , tried desperately to hail a cab . Street cleaners had come down Orchard while they were inside the club , and the street was glossed black with oily water . " I know , " she agreed . " You 'd think there 'd be some cabs . Where is everyone going at midnight on a Sunday ? " She turned back to him , shrugging . " You think we 'd have better luck on Houston ? " " Not the cabs , " Simon said . " You  --  I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knives just disappeared . " Clary sighed . " Maybe there were n't any guys with knives , Simon . Maybe I just imagined the whole thing . " " No way . " Simon raised his hand over his head , but the oncoming taxis whizzed by him , spraying dirty water . " I saw your face when I came into that storage room . You looked seriously freaked out , like you 'd seen a ghost . " Clary thought of Jace with his lion-cat eyes . She glanced down at her wrist , braceleted by a thin red line where Isabelle 's whip had curled . No , not a ghost , she thought . Something even weirder than that . " It was just a mistake , " she said wearily . She wondered why she was n't telling him the truth . Except , of course , that he 'd think she was crazy . And there was something about what had happened  --  something about the black blood bubbling up around Jace 's knife , something about his voice when he 'd said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to keep to herself . " Well , it was a hell of an embarrassing mistake , " Simon said . He glanced back at the club , where a thin line still snaked out the door and halfway down the block . " I doubt they 'll ever let us back into Pandemonium . " " What do you care ? You hate Pandemonium . " Clary raised her hand again as a yellow shape sped toward them through the fog . This time , though , the taxi screeched to a halt at their corner , the driver laying into his horn as if he needed to get their attention . " Finally we get lucky . " Simon yanked the taxi door open and slid onto the plastic-covered backseat . Clary followed , inhaling the familiar New York cab smell of old cigarette smoke , leather , and hair spray . " We 're going to Brooklyn , " Simon said to the cabbie , and then he turned to Clary . " Look , you know you can tell me anything , right ? " Clary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon , " she said . " I know I can . " She slammed the cab door shut behind her , and the taxi took off into the night .
