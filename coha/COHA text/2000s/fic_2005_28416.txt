Hot Flash Holidays By Nancy Thayer Random House Nancy Thayer On this early December day , snowflakes sparkled down to earth like granted wishes from a magic wand . Inside the handsome lounge of The Haven , Yule logs blazed cheerfully in the fireplace , while Presley , Sinatra , and Springsteen sang Christmas carols . Near the long casement windows , five women were looping lights around a Norway spruce so tall they had to use a ladder to reach the highest branches . " Okay , that 's the end of the last string , " Marilyn called from behind the fat tree . " Plug them in , " Shirley told her . Marilyn knelt to fit the plug into the socket . " Oooooooh ! " Shirley , Faye , Alice , Marilyn , and Polly sighed with delight as dozens and dozens of multicolored miniature lights twinkled to life . " Now , " Shirley announced , " for the fun part . How shall we do this ? " Shirley was the director of The Haven , but the four other women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wanted to please everyone . " I think we should all hang the ornaments we brought where we want , " Polly suggested . " But keep in mind , " Faye added , " it will look better if the heaviest , biggest ornaments go on the bottom boughs , with the smaller ones on the higher branches . " She was an artist , with an artist 's eye . " Yes , but we do n't want it to look too perfect , " Alice insisted . " We want it to look real . " " Good point , Alice , " Shirley agreed . " Perfection , as we all know , is n't real . " " Sometimes it is , " Marilyn disagreed , in her thoughtful , vague way . " The horseshoe crab , genus Limulus , for example , is perfect . Its design has n't changed since the Triassic period , that 's two hundred forty-five million years . " " Lovely , " Faye said gently , amused . " Still , we really do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I suppose not . Although one year we did . " Marilyn smiled at the memory . She was a paleobiologist -- the others teasingly called her a pale old biologist -- and her grown son and her ex-husband were molecular geneticists . " Teddy was nine , and fascinated with crustaceans and fossils , so we bored holes in lots of shells , slipped colored cords through , and hung the tree with crabs , mollusks , and gastropods . " Alice snorted with laughter . " You are so weird ! " " Oh , I do n't know , " Polly chimed in . " David told me that he and Amy are hanging only homemade decorations on their tree . And my daughter-in-law is such a purist , she 'll use only vegetable dyes , natural wood , straw , and such . Afterwards , they 'll probably carry the tree outside and feed the entire thing to the goat . " The others laughed . As they talked , they moved back and forth from the tables and couches where the boxes of decorations were set out . Occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , with its casement windows , high ceilings , and mahogany paneling , seemed to glow with contentment . Once built to house a private boarding school , this old stone lodge had been abandoned for a few years . Then Shirley , with the help of her friends and a few investors , had bought it and opened The Haven , a premier spa and wellness resort with a burgeoning membership and second-floor condos for staff or friends . She had staff ( she had staff ! Shirley , who had struggled financially most of her life , got a thrill every time she remembered that ) . But she had n't wanted her staff to decorate the Christmas tree , and neither had her friends . They 'd wanted to do this together . They 'd agreed to bring three boxes of decorations each , and they 'd agreed to do it without advance discussion or collaboration , so their choices would be a surprise . Now they worked quickly , climbing the ladder to adorn the top , stretching left and right , standing back to appraise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exclaiming at what the others had chosen . Shirley was a sucker for whimsical creatures with smiling faces : elves , snowmen , Santa Clauses , cherubs , fat angels with crooked smiles and tilted halos , fairies with freckles and yarn hair . Faye had selected expensive glass ornaments : gorgeous faceted stars , elongated teardrops and iridescent icicles , extravagantly striped or translucent balls in gleaming gemstone colors . Polly loved to cook . She 'd baked dozens of gingerbread men and women , sugar-cookie stars , leaping reindeer , trumpets and drummer boys and crescent moons , the absorbing , familiar activity bringing back memories of Christmases when her son was little . She 'd decorated them with colored icing , silver balls , and sprinkles of colored sugar , and glued ribbons firmly on the back , for hanging . She 'd also strung cranberries and popcorn on fishing wire and bought boxes of candy canes . Alice , less sentimental and more practical , had chosen thirty of the skin care , cosmetic , and aromatherapy products on sale at The Haven , and tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marilyn 's contribution was a boxed set of antique ornaments from the Museum of Fine Arts , and a handmade collection of brass and enamel stars , sun , moon , and planets purchased from an Asian gentleman selling them from a rug on a sidewalk in Harvard Square . When every ornament was hung , the five women stepped back to admire their handiwork . The mixture was eccentric , aesthetically enchanting , and wildly cheerful . " It 's fabulous , " Shirley said . " Let me get my camera . " Alice said , " I 'll pour the hot chocolate . " She twisted the cap off a large Thermos and poured the fragrant liquid into Christmas mugs -- little gifts from her to the others . Then , without the slightest twinge of guilt , she took out a can of Reddi-whip , shook it , and topped the drinks with snowy swirls of the white concoction . After that , she opened a little plastic bag , dipped her hand in , and sprinkled dark chocolate shavings on the creamy peaks . " I brought some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and green tin , and the sweet , warm aroma of butter and sugar rose into the air . Marilyn and Faye pushed two of the more comfortable wing chairs close to the sofa so they could all sit in a half-circle , facing the tree . Shirley returned from her office with the camera and began snapping shots of the tree and its trimmers . Shirley wore purple Tencel pants with an emerald top that flattered her auburn hair . Her earrings and necklace were miniature battery-operated Christmas lights that blinked on and off . Faye wore scarlet trousers in a silk-and-wool weave with a matching jacket over a sleeveless white shell . A chunky choker of garnet and jade circled her neck . Her white hair was held back with a matching barrette . Plump , auburn-haired Polly wore jeans and a bright green sweater with white snowmen she 'd designed and knit herself . Alice looked majestic in a velvet tunic and pants of swirling crimson and indigo , embellished with lavish gold embroidery . Earrings , necklace , and bracelets of heavy , scrolled gold gleamed against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shapeless gray sweater . She was n't color-blind ; she just kept forgetting to think about her clothing . The five curled up on the sofa and settled into the chairs . Shirley raised her mug . " To the holidays ! " " To the holidays ! " the others toasted . They all sipped the rich hot chocolate , and sighed in unison . Faye focused dreamily on the twinkling tree . " This is going to be the best Christmas ever ! " Alice chuckled . " Yes , and I 'm Glinda , the Good Witch of the North . " " Did you know , " Shirley informed them , " in the movie The Wizard of Oz , Glinda , the Good Witch of the North , was played by an actress named Billie Burke when she was fifty-three years old ? " " You 're kidding ! " Polly nearly spilled her cocoa . " She looked so young ! All that blond hair . The sparkling pink dress . The tiara . " " I wish I had that dress , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wand , " Marilyn murmured . Alice lazily turned her head toward Marilyn . " Really . What would you do with it ? " Marilyn did n't hesitate . " I 'd turn my mother back into her normal , independent self . Oh , yes , and renovate Faraday 's sexual abilities . " " He 's still impotent ? " A former hotshot executive , Alice did n't mince words . Besides , they 'd helped solve one another 's problems before , and were ready to do it again , if they could . " Always . " Marilyn 's tone was rich with regret . She 'd only discovered the joys of sex in her fifties , and she wanted to make up for lost time . " You need a magic wand to make his wand magic , " Polly joked . " What 's going on with your mother , Marilyn ? " Shirley asked . Marilyn sighed . " My sister says she 's going downhill fast . Not physically , mentally . Sharon wants me to have Mother come here for Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of senility and help her decide whether or not Mother should be ' persuaded ' to go into an assisted care facility . " " Hard decision , " Faye sympathized . " I know . " Marilyn pinched the bridge of her nose . " Sharon said she ca n't make this kind of decision herself , and she 's absolutely right . " " How old is your mom ? " Alice asked . " Eighty-five . She lives in Ohio , in the same town where we grew up , only a short drive from my sister 's home . I 've always felt guilty that I have n't been able to help Mother as much as Sharon has . But I live so far away , and I do n't want to give up my position at MIT . " " Not to mention , " Alice teased , " you often have trouble keeping your thoughts in the same millennium , never mind on the same species . " " There is that , " Marilyn agreed easily . " Is Faraday spending the holidays with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is . He 's got two grown children and some grandchildren , but one lives in California and the other in Ohio . " " It 's hard when your kids live so far away . " Faye looked wistful . " Thank heavens , Laura and Megan and Lars are coming back east for Christmas . I ca n't wait to get my hands on my little granddaughter again . I hope she remembers me . " " Faye , " Alice bossily reminded her , " you 've chatted with her every day on your web-cam . " " Yes , but it 's not the same . I want to hold her . Smell her . Cuddle her . " " I know exactly what you mean . " Polly 's son and his family lived only a short drive away geographically , but emotionally , they were on Pluto . " Will you get to see your grandson for Christmas ? " Faye asked . " I 've been invited for Christmas dinner . " Polly made a face . " But it will be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relatives , so I know I wo n't be able to hold Jehoshaphat much . Plus , they 're so virtuous . I always feel like Mae West visiting the Amish . " " What about Hugh ? " Alice , Marilyn , Shirley , and Faye all asked in chorus . Polly had been dating the handsome doctor since April , and their hopes for her were high . Polly deserved someone won- derful . " Hugh 's spending Christmas day with his children and his ex-wife . " Polly mimed pulling out her hair . " The size-six , perpetually dependent , helpless little Betsie . " " Well , that sucks , " Shirley said . " Come have Christmas with us . " " Thanks , but actually , I 've been invited to Christmas dinner at Carolyn 's , and I just might go there instead . " " Oh , do ! " Faye told her , impulsively . " I 'll be there , with Aubrey . " " Really ? " Polly brightened . " I wonder whether Carolyn would mind if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faye thought silently . Carolyn wants her father to marry you . She shifted uncomfortably on the sofa , then leaned forward to grab a cookie . Polly had helped Carolyn during a stressful time in her life , and Carolyn , whose mother had died when Carolyn was just a child , had pounced on Polly as a surrogate mom . Polly was so good-natured and sweet , she did n't seem aware of Carolyn 's intentions to match her father up with her , and if she were aware , Polly would be so horrified , she 'd probably move to Alaska . Faye really liked Polly , the newest member of the Hot Flash Club , and did n't want to cause her any embarrassment . Alice looked puzzled . " Faye , I thought you said Lars and Laura and baby Megan were coming to have Christmas with you . " " They 're coming east , yes , " Faye explained . " They 're spending Christmas Eve and Christmas morning and most of the day with me . They 're going to Lars 's family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so complicated ! " " Yeah , but the food 's good , " Polly pointed out cheerfully . Simultaneously , everyone reached forward to grab a cookie . They all laughed . " I always gain ten pounds over Christmas , " Faye moaned , munching . " It 's impossible not to , " Alice assured her as she chewed . " It 's stress eating . " Polly giggled . " Last night I ate a pepperoni pizza , a pint of ice cream , and two bags of mega-butter popcorn . " " I can trump that , " Alice said . " I bought a box of expensive chocolates to take to my bridge group , and last night I sat down and ate them all . " Shirley licked a curl of cream off her spoon . " Hey , Faye . You said you think this will be the best Christmas ever . Want to elaborate ? " " Well , I did n't mean ever , " Faye corrected herself . Continues ...          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
