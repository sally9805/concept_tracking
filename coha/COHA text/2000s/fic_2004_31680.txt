Chapter One Throne In his seventeenth year of life , Jai gained an empire and lost everything he valued . Stately buildings faced a plaza tiled in white and gray stone . Clouds hung low in the sky , their drizzle saturating the air . Evening had come , a time when the heat of the sixty-two-hour day on the world Delos cooled enough to make the temperature tolerable for its human colonists . Two young men walked across the plaza , coming from the embassy of the Allied Worlds of Earth . One wore simple clothes , a sweater and trousers . The other had on elegant garb with a severe cut , the cloth as black as shadows . Even in the misty air , his black hair glittered . On the other side of the plaza , the embassy of the Eubian Concord stood in grandeur , large and solid , with many columns . Six men descended its stairs . Four were strongly built and moved like machines , their uniforms black and their eyes the color of rust . They were guarding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taller even than the looming guards , had a shock of glittering white hair and a commanding presence . His patrician features and red eyes identified him as a Highton Aristo , a member of the most powerful , the wealthiest , and possibly the most hated ruling caste ever known to humanity . The other manhad his wrists locked behind his back in slave restraints . The prisoner moved stiffly , his chin thrust out but his eyes glazed . A gust stirred his wine-red hair around his handsome face . A diamond collar circled his neck and diamond guards glinted on his wrists and ankles . His white shirt , costly and impractical , was tucked into his dark pants . He walked barefoot . The groups approached each other . The two youths from the Allied Embassy stopped in the center of the plaza . The one in black clothes was tall , with broad shoulders and an athletic build . His features very much resembled those of the Highton man with the glittering white hair and were subtly echoed in the faces of the four guards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at first glance . Jai Rockworth waited with his friend , Mik Fresnel , as the group of Eubians crossed the plaza to them . A deep-seated fear within Jai urged him to run , but he forced himself to remain still . He now wished he had brought more people . Had he been naive , assuming the Eubians would treat this exchange with honor ? Given the number of armed guards in their group , he would have little recourse if they decided to take him without relinquishing their prisoner . But it was too late for second thoughts . If he did n't go through with this now , he might never find the courage to try again . He recognized the white-haired man in the center of the Eubian group : Corbal Xir . Jai had seen him on countless news broadcasts . As a cousin of the late emperor , Xir stood close to the Carnelian Throne of Eube . The emperor , Jaibriol the Second , had died without a known heir , and many expected Xir to claim the title . The ruby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matched his own . During the last two years , Jai had hidden his with brown lenses . Xir showed no such compunction about revealing his Aristo genetics . Jai felt as if a band were constricting around his chest . He had no idea how to deal with a man like Xir . The Eubian group halted a few paces in front of him . The man in slave restraints stood with a numb expression , watching Jai with no hint of recognition . But Jai knew his face . Eldrin Valdoria . Prince Eldrin . His uncle . If I could free you from your pain by taking it into myself , Jai thought , I would . Nothing he could do would change what his uncle had already suffered , but he could see to it that Eldrin endured no more . He tried not to think that it would take so little , so terrifyingly little , for him to end up exactly like his uncle . Xir spoke to Jai in the language of the Highton Aristos , his voice a rumble of authority . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk forward at the same time . " " Very well , " Jai answered in flawless Highton . But when he turned to Mik , he switched to English . " Thank you for coming . " He wanted to say so much more , but he could n't take the risk . Mik glanced uneasily at the Eubians . When he gave Jai a questioning look , Jai shook his head , fearing Mik would ask for an explanation Jai could never provide . But Mik just offered his hand . Jai shook it with a gratitude he did n't dare show , and also with sorrow , knowing he was saying good-bye to his friend forever . " I 'm not sure what you 're doing , " Mik said quietly . " But I will remember what you said . " Jai wished he could say more : Never forget . No matter what you hear of me from this day on , remember the Jai you knew . But Mik could n't hear his thoughts , and Jai could say nothing in front of the Eubians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he composed his face into a mask of Highton arrogance and faced Corbal Xir . Jai had barricaded his telepath 's mind , turning it into a mental fortress , and so he received nothing from the Eubians , no sense of their emotions or thoughts . Prince Eldrin was staring at him-and suddenly Jai felt his uncle 's mind . Recognition went through him like a jolt of electricity : Eldrin was also a telepath . Even having known it ahead of time , Jai was still startled by the strength of his uncle 's mind . Either Jai was more attuned to him than to the Aristos , who had no ability as psions , or else his uncle 's mental barriers had slipped . Whatever the reason , the impact of Eldrin 's emotions staggered Jai . He knew the other man 's confusion and anguish as if it were his own . Another realization hit him : until this moment , Eldrin had known nothing about the exchange . The shock of realizing his captors intended to trade him had caused Eldrin 's barriers to slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show a calm he did n't come close to feeling . " Shall we begin ? " " Yes . " The prince 's voice rasped with laryngitis so severe he had trouble speaking . The raw sound of his uncle 's voice shook Jai . He feared to learn what had injured Eldrin 's vocal cords . Screams left scars that could haunt a man . He and Eldrin walked forward . When they reached each other , Jai wanted to stop , to ask Eldrin the questions surging within him , to offer reassurance , to beg forgiveness for the life Jai was embarking on . But he could do nothing , show no hint of his roiling emotions . They passed in silence , Eldrin going to the Allieds and Jai to the Eubians . Jai stopped when he reached Corbal Xir . The older man nodded in acknowledgment , though of what , Jai did n't know . A chill went through him at the soulless intensity of Xir 's gaze . Jai returned his nod , then turned to see Eldrin reach Mik . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and Jai stared at each other . In that moment , even the mist seemed to wait . Would Eldrin ask why ? Would he curse his captors ? The moment passed , and Jai no longer felt his uncle 's emotions . Eldrin 's mental barriers had come up again . Jai did n't think his uncle even realized they had slipped . The Eubians closed around Jai in a tight formation and swept him away , headed for their embassy . Jai set his shoulders and faced his future , though dread haunted him . So it was that Jai Rockworth-also known as Jaibriol the Third-claimed his place as emperor of Eube , the largest empire in the history of humanity . Chapter Two Advent A portico with a high arch formed the entrance of the Eubian Embassy . As Jai entered the building , a muscle in his cheek twitched . The four guards loomed around him , bulky and silent , arms swinging precisely at their sides , their faces hard . He found it difficult to absorb the enormity of it , that he walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in settled space . When the great doors of the embassy thundered shut behind them , Jai felt as if he were trapped in a mausoleum . Jai Rockworth had died ; from this day on he was Jaibriol III . He protected his mind , strengthening his mental shields until no trace of his telepathic ability could leak to the Traders with him . No , the Eubians . He had to remember ; Eubians never referred to themselves as Traders . That name came from the people of the Skolian Imperialate , who abhorred the Eubians for basing their economy on a slave trade . For the rest of his life , Jai would have to maintain his defenses ; he could never weaken , neither in his behavior nor his mental protections , lest it reveal that he who dared claim the Carnelian Throne was a slave . A provider . Nausea surged in Jai and he nearly lost his composure . More than any other reason , Aristos were hated because they used providers to transcend . Providers were empaths and telepaths ; Aristos were anti-empaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anguish of a psion , but instead of registering it as pain , the Aristo felt pleasure . The stronger a psion , the more transcendence he or she " provided " the Aristo . Craving the experience with a need that verged on obsession , Aristos made psions into the slaves they called " providers . " Their pitiless culture allowed no exceptions ; all empaths and telepaths were providers . Jai knew he would have to protect his mind every day for the rest of his life . The immensity of it was more than he could absorb . If he slipped even once , revealing he was a psion , his life would become hell . And yet-his claim to the throne was genuine . To gain his title he had sent Corbal Xir a lock of his hair . Its DNA would show him as the true son of Jaibriol II , the previous emperor of Eube , who had died less than two months ago . The Eubians would undoubtedly check and double-check his DNA , but Jai knew they would find the proof they needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eubian Concord and been its first emperor . Eube had been an Aristo of course , a Highton in fact , part of the highest Aristo caste . Only a Highton could be emperor . Jai 's great-grandfather , Jaibriol I , had also been a Highton Aristo , as had been Jai 's grandfather , Ur Qox . Or so everyone believed . Only Jai knew the truth : his great-grandfather had bred psi traits into the imperial line . A powerful enough psion could use ancient technology that survived from the long-dead Ruby Empire , technology the modern age could n't reproduce-or defend against . But no Aristo could be a psion ; the traits , considered a debilitating weakness , were n't part of the Aristo gene pool . The genes that created a psion were recessive , which meant both parents had to contribute them to their child for the abilities to manifest . Jaibriol I had sired a son with one of his providers and forced his empress to acknowledge the child as her own , making the boy heir to the throne . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been fanatically hungry for the power of the ancient Ruby machines . The boy , Ur Qox , had been Jai 's grandfather . Ur had the psi genes only from his mother , so he was n't a psion . But he too fathered a child on one of his providers-and that son , Jaibriol II , had been a Ruby telepath , the most powerful of all psions . He possessed the mental power to use the ancient machines , which would have made it possible for him to conquer human-settled space . Through him , the Aristos could have subjugated all humanity . Jaibriol II had other ideas . He had fled his heritage , appalled by its brutality , and secretly married another Ruby psion , a warrior queen of the Skolian Imperialate , Eube 's greatest enemy . Her name had been Soz Valdoria . Jai 's mother . So Jai had been born a Ruby telepath , the first child of Jaibriol II and Soz Valdoria . No one knew his mother and father had hidden in exile for fifteen years . But ESComm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father and torn him away from his idyllic life , never realizing he had a family . In secret , Jai 's mother had left her children on Earth , to protect them . Then she had launched the Radiance War-a shattering conflict that brought two star-spanning empires to their knees-all to rescue her husband from his own people . Jai 's parents had died in that war . One consolation remained to Jai , the knowledge that his mother and father had been reunited in an escape shuttle before a missile exploded it . They had died together . He struggled against the hotness in his eyes . The grief was too great ; he had never been able to weep for their loss . He feared if he started , he would never stop . His parents had dreamed of a time when Eube and Skolia would know peace . Somehow , some way , he would turn that dream into reality . He would find a way to ensure that the two people who had gifted him with their unconditional love had n't died in vain . Drizzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His body ached from his last " chat " with his interrogators . He stared dully after the Traders as they walked toward their embassy , two Highton Aristos surrounded by four guards . He wondered what game of cruelty they were playing with him this time . The unfamiliar youth who had stayed here in the plaza spoke to Eldrin in stilted Highton , his accent almost too thick to understand . " Cold you are ? We go back . " Eldrin narrowed his gaze . The youth looked about eighteen , average in height , a bit shorter than Eldrin , with brown hair and eyes , and a friendly face . If Eldrin had n't known better , he would have mistaken his new tormentor for a schoolboy from Earth . The youth glanced at Eldrin 's bound arms , then raised his gaze quickly , as if he did n't want to look . " Like you to make your arms free ? " he asked . Eldrin stepped back , his head jerking . What new tricks had they devised ? His jaw clenched so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Okay , we do n't have to do that , " the boy said in English , more to himself than Eldrin . In his terrible Highton , he added , " Go we to Allied Embassy . " He indicated a building . " Embassy . Allied Worlds . Earth . You come with me , yes ? " They picked a good actor . Eldrin readied himself to fight or run . Realistically , he knew he would lose either way ; he could do little with his hands locked behind his back . But he had to try . He could n't let them break him . " Come , yes ? " the boy repeated . " We remove restraints . " Eldrin had intended to stay silent , but he could n't keep his hatred inside . " Go rot in a Tazorli whorehouse . " He spoke in Skolian Flag , a language of his own people . He would never willingly use Highton , not if they tortured him for a hundred years . The youth 's eyes widened . He switched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I swear it . " He spoke the Skolian much better than Highton . " You are free now , in the territory of the Allied Worlds of Earth . We offer you protection . " Eldrin said nothing . Continues ...
