How to meet the needs of an expanding family Photograph A series of concrete platforms-nestled among begonias , lavender , and campanula-creates a welcoming approach to the front door and a great place for Jack , Robbie , and Hannah to play . The kitchen opens to the family room , which makes both spaces feel larger . // Standing at the counter of her sunny kitchen in Pacific Palisades , California , Leslie Woolley is on the phone organizing a school event while directing traffic-Hannah , 11 ; Jack , 9 ; and Robbie , 7-and somehow managing to make this nosy Sunset writer feel entirely welcome . The open , airy home , which was renovated in two phases as the family expanded and the children grew older , is the perfect platform for this bustling family of five-six if you count Freddie , the recently rescued Lhasa apso and terrier mix . " I caved , " Woolley admits . The 2,700-square-foot home is " a kid-friendly house , " she says . " Hardwood floors run everywhere-there is no carpeting the kids can ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can look out and see the kids playing in the front yard and the backyard . " On weekends , breakfast , lunch , and dinner are served on the patio . There are no screens on the windows or doors . " We do n't have a lot of bugs here , " Woolley explains . When Woolley and husband Michael Rogers bought the one-story , Cape Cod-inspired cottage in 1994-a job transfer brought them here from New York-it had two bedrooms and one and a half bathrooms . They knew that they would need to adjust the house to meet the needs of their family of four ( Robbie was yet to come ) , but they did n't want an addition to eat into the big backyard , a feature they loved .

The kitchen opens to the family room , which makes both spaces feel larger . // The first renovation The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The house is on a nice corner lot with a deep garden , " says architect Michael Sant , " but the detached garage sat right in the middle of it all . " Both the kitchen and the family room looked directly onto the garage-6 feet away-where the rear patio is today . The garage was torn down and a new one was attached to the house ; a master suite was added above the garage . The addition gave the house an L-shaped plan , and no backyard space was lost . The family lived in the house while the first renovation was taking place . " I was pregnant and feeling awful , " Woolley says . She can distinctly recall a construction worker announcing , " I do n't think I 've ever seen anyone lie down and take a nap in the middle of a construction site . " The family had a makeshift bathroom with exposed 2-by-4s and a temporary tub surrounded by black plastic sheeting . " I remember looking up from the shower one day and realizing that the construction workers could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was hideous , but it 's like childbirth-you live through it and then you forget how bad it was . It 's all worth it in the end . " Little of the original home was altered in the first renovation . For six years , the family lived happily in their new space .

A large pocket door separates the master bath from the corridor . // The second renovation " We began the second renovation because the fridge broke , " Woolley explains . It was the home 's original refrigerator and was unusually small . " We could not find any fridge that would fit in the space-and we were n't looking for a grand , oversize one . We started discussing bumping out the kitchen wall . " As often happens in remodeling , one seemingly small decision led to much larger ones : the couple began to rethink the entire kitchen and the neighboring family room . Before long , they also were considering an additional bedroom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , but it never grew out of control . " We were conscientious not to build too big a house for the lot , " Woolley says . The family added space , but the greatest gains in efficiency came from Sant 's reconfiguration of the existing spaces . He removed the maze of doors that had connected the living/dining space , the tiny family room , and the kitchen . The fireplace was grouped with built-in cabinetry to create a freestanding unit that the spaces flow around ; it provides enough separation to create distinct rooms , but it also allows for visual connections .

" Small windows-crowded by cabinets-were replaced by three large windows . All of the upper cabinets were moved to the opposite wall in place of a doorway . " It was surprising how such minor changes made the kitchen feel more spacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the original house but was more modern . The second time around , the couple carried details from the addition throughout the home . For example , the original painted double-hung windows were replaced with simple Douglas fir frames , which hold casement and hopper ( top-in ) windows . " A repose emerged just by simplifying the windows , " Sant says .

The light and airy solution , which contrasts icy blue glass mosaic tiles with warm wood , met the family 's needs beautifully . The large Lumasitepaneled pocket door is the key : it takes up less space than a conventional swinging door , and when it 's open , the bathroom and the adjacent corridor to the master bedroom flow together , making the master suite seem more spacious . When closed , the door provides visual privacy , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathroom , the cantilevered shelving defines the shower area without walling it off from the vanity . This allows light from both the window and the skylight to fill the space . Plenty of storage is provided beneath the vanity , and small niches for bath essentials are built into the shower wall to eliminate the need for caddies . The result is a calm , uncluttered bathroom that 's easy to keep that way . // <p>
