Introduction // One November morning in 2004 , Theo van Gogh got up to go to work at his film production company in Amsterdam . He took out his old black bicycle and headed down a main road . Waiting in a doorway was a Moroccan man with a handgun and two butcher knives . // As Theo cycled down the Linnaeusstraat , Muhammad Bouyeri approached . He pulled out his gun and shot Theo several times . Theo fell off his bike and lurched across the road , then collapsed . Bouyeri followed . Theo begged , " Ca n't we talk about this ? " but Bouyeri shot him four more times . Then he took out one of his butcher knives and sawed into Theo 's throat . With the other knife , he stabbed a five-page letter onto Theo 's chest . // The letter was addressed to me. // Two months before , Theo and I had made a short film together . We called it Submission , Part 1 . I intended one day to make Part 2 . ( Theo warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I accepted some humor in it ! ) Part 1 was about defiance  --  about Muslim women who shift from total submission to God to a dialogue with their deity . They pray , but instead of casting down their eyes , these women look up , at Allah , with the words of the Quran tattooed on their skin . They tell Him honestly that if submission to Him brings them so much misery , and He remains silent , they may stop submitting. // There is the woman who is flogged for committing adultery ; another who is given in marriage to a man she loathes ; another who is beaten by her husband on a regular basis ; and another who is shunned by her father when he learns that his brother raped her . Each abuse is justified by the perpetrators in the name of God , citing the Quran verses now written on the bodies of the women . These women stand for hundreds of thousands of Muslim women around the world . // Theo and I knew it was a dangerous film to make . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warrior , however unlikely that might seem . He was also very Dutch , and no nation in the world is more deeply attached to freedom of expression than the Dutch . The suggestion that he remove his name from the film 's credits for security reasons made Theo angry . He told me once , " If I ca n't put my name on my own film , in Holland , then Holland is n't Holland any more , and I am not me. " // People ask me if I have some kind of death wish , to keep saying the things I do . The answer is no : I would like to keep living . However , some things must be said , and there are times when silence becomes an accomplice to injustice . // This is the story of my life . It is a subjective record of my own personal memories , as close to accurate as I can make them ; my relationship with the rest of my family has been so fractured that I can not now refresh these recollections by asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have experienced , what I 've seen , and why I think the way I do . I 've come to see that it is useful , and maybe even important , to tell this story . I want to make a few things clear , set a certain number of records straight , and also tell people about another kind of world and what it 's really like . // I was born in Somalia . I grew up in Somalia , in Saudi Arabia , in Ethiopia , and in Kenya . I came to Europe in 1992 , when I was twenty-two , and became a member of Parliament in Holland . I made a movie with Theo , and now I live with bodyguards and armored cars . In April 2006 a Dutch court ordered that I leave my safe-home that I was renting from the State . The judge concluded that my neighbors had a right to argue that they felt unsafe because of my presence in the building . I had already decided to move to the United States before the debate surrounding my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my family , and also to the millions and millions of Muslim women who have had to submit . //
