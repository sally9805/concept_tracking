<p> Feliz cumpleaos : Assiduously avoiding a big deal b-day , Stanlee Gatti still got punked by his pals , former Mayor Willie Brown and Mayor Gavin Newsom , when the dynamic duo co-hosted a surprise party , with organizational assists from Becca Prowda and Paige Barry . <p> The usual suspects were summoned to North Beach to await the birthday boy at Pea Pachamama , a Bolivian restaurant where a lively showcase of traditional South American music and wild dancing occurs nightly . This night , even more so . <p> In the conga line : Charlotte Shultz ; District Attorney Kamala Harris ; Wilkes Bashford ; Gina Moscone ; Elaine McKeon and her family ; Eileen Michael and Cathy and Ned Topham ; Sonya Molodetskaya ; Mimi Haas and her son , Daniel Lurie ; Debby Magowan ; Richard and Eleanor Johns ; Karen and P.J. Johnston ; Sarah and Darius Anderson ; Matthew Goudeau ; Dan Henkle and Steve Kawa ; Katie Lucas ; and Radio Alice 's Hooman . <p> The mayor ( wisely ) skipped a proclamation , presenting Gatti with something more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county of San Francisco , I 'd like to personally thank you for years of illegal parking . In an effort to bolster your personal fortunes , we present you this jar filled with 1,000 quarters , the ' I Meters ' fund ! " <p> Newsom also complimented his guests ' subterfuge : " There are no secrets in this room because all of you are the biggest gossips in San Francisco . It 's a testament to everyone here that Stanlee is actually surprised tonight ! " <p> Producer Carole Shorenstein Hays was in New York , so her husband , Jeff Hays , brought along their neighbor Robin Williams , who declared the wildly rhythmic nightspot " the kind of place even the Amish would dance . " <p> Between pounding drums and feathered headdresses , the gang realized that Jeannette Etheredge and Gordon Getty had disappeared and chalked it up to the raucous music . <p> Actually , it was a quick trip to Coit Liquors , where Gordon , a vino connoisseur , augmented the restaurant 's offerings . Laden with brown-paper-wrapped bottles , they rejoined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fevered rap , Getty let out a basso profundo cry : " Somebody stole my Paul Hobbs ! " <p> Williams ' fire fueled , the comedic ( and generous ) genius then reduced the billionaire to fits of laughter . <p> " What a great room  --  just like the Last Supper . Except the Last Supper might not have happened if Jesus worried where the Paul Hobbs went ! Ca n't you just see it ? Winos out on the street begging , ' Hey , man , help me out . I need 50 bucks for a bottle of Paul Hobbs . ' " <p> Brilliantly riffing ( Arnold and Maria , gay marriage , Karl Rove , ) Williams also foresaw the futures of Messieurs Brown and Newsom : " I have a dream of ... calla lilies ! I have a dream of huge sprays of white roses ! " " No , no , no . The flowers go next to my office . " <p> Toasting his hosts , Stanlee delivered the highest praise : " I never thought I 'd say this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really are two people who can give a better party than me . " <p> Mod Squad : Gallerist Martin Muller promised , and delivered , a colorful evening celebrating " New Paintings , " the latest exhibition by Austrian artist Gottfried Helnwein , at Modernism . <p> Especially if you 're seated between Helnwein and his friend-collector Marilyn Manson at Muller 's Modernism West annex for a postshow repast created by the artisans of Foreign Cinema . <p> " Just call me Manson , " said the rocker , sporting a subdued version of his signature undead look . " I was a journalist once . But I got tired of too many boring interviews . " <p> Hmm , I pondered . So my future is filled with face paint or this is going to a long , painful dinner ... for both of us . <p> But Helnwein and Manson are fascinating , articulate men who happen to create uncomfortable art . Manson even created his own movement  --  Celebritarian Corp .  --  which I sha n't even attempt to interpret . <p> I pleaded similar ignorance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! moment , when I said his " Untitled " piece ( featured on Martin 's flyer ) brought to mind a nightmarish version of " Alice in Wonderland . " <p> Guess who plans to create a film about Lewis Carroll , with Manson in the starring role ? <p> Helnwein lives in Ireland but paints in Los Angeles : " L.A. is a place for anarchy . It 's a good place to create art . " His countryman Gov . Arnold Schwarzenegger sometimes drops by . " It 's seldom I meet a politician I actually like , " said Helnwein , laughing . " Arnold operates on the naive belief that you can make something better . He reinvents stuff . " <p> Beneath the floating , flitting images of Naomie Kremer 's " Paint Moves , " guests at the one long table included Helnwein 's daughter , Mercedes ; Austin Hills ; Metallica 's Lars Ulrich and his pal Steve Wiig ; Chronicle Managing Editor Robert Rosenthal and his wife , Inka ; and Margaret and Peter Allen . Manson had n't met author/painter/bon vivant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Conrad 's absinthe book . <p> Earlier Barnaby had quipped cleverly ( natch ) about his beloved " green fairy " elixir . Asking for a repeat , Conrad thought for a moment , then broke into a big grin . " I do n't remember . And if you ca n't remember , that 's definitely an ' absinthe ' quote ! " <p> Holiday babble-on : Actually , the season arrived before Halloween with the ( unhallowed ) opening of Macy 's Holiday Lane . And Dec. 1 ( alone ) is already jam-packed with holiday cheer . <p> First up ( in geographical order , north to south ) : A village gathers at the Village at Corte Madera Shopping Center to help cure cancer . Katie Lucas ( teen dynamo daughter of director George Lucas ) co-chairs the Marin Cancer Project 's Search for the Cause campaign , featuring celebs ( whom Katie helped corral ) wearing dog-tag-style necklaces ( created by Marin Academy student Danielle Kingsley ) whose sale raises funds for the project 's investigation into the county 's spiraling cancer rates . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual Jingle &; Mingle Designer Wreath Auction , featuring colorful creations by local designers , including Suzanne Tucker , Orlando Diaz-Azcuy , Skip Price , Steven Volpe and Martha Angus . <p> Actor Danny Glover emcees the Museum of the African Diaspora ( MoAD ) inaugural gala at the swanky new St. Regis Hotel . Also featured are three commissioned artworks underwritten by arts patron and farmer Nan Tucker McEvoy . <p> " We all came from Africa . Civilization 's oldest fossils , its seed , comes from that continent , " said MoAD board president and beloved journalist Belva Davis . " Our mission , if we are successful , is for everyone to understand their place in the world . <p> " And Willie ( former Mayor Brown ) is the only person who would 've dared dream to house an Africa museum in a five-star hotel ! " <p> They 'll leave the light on : From the stylish lobby , Belva spotted St. Regis General Manager Elias Assaly ( who leads a staff of 400 ) , polishing a thumbprint off a marble planter ... himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Herewith , some five-star stats :  --  Clocking in at ( reputedly ) $300 mil , the St. Regis may be the most expensive hotel built in America .  --  The 260 Paul Wiseman-designed guest rooms ( tricked out with 42-inch plasma TVs , original art , smart-room controls , leather walls , Pratesi linens , butler service ) cost roughly a $1 mil each .  --  At the tippy-top of the 40-story tower , the penthouses are rumored to carry a $10 mil price tag , each . Rumor ( again ) has it , all three were snapped up by one buyer for a combined 20,000 square feet or so , with 360-degree city views . <p> The tenant roster is equally breathtaking : former veep ( turned cable-TV mogul ) Al Gore and his wife , Tipper Gore , and a longtime power broker known for his creative flair in serving up Jack Daniel 's . <p> The whole shebang is atop the hallowed grounds of the late newspaper bar Jerry &; Johnny , now home to Ame , the sleek Asian-fusion restaurant run by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 217 of us left yet to embrace blog-casting , that is ) may take solace in the fact that the old King Cole Room of the St. Regis Hotel in New York gave birth to the Bloody Mary . But it 'll cost ya a few bits more than the price of a shot and a beer . <p> Royal regales : We hope their Royal Highnesses , Prince Charles and Camilla , Duchess of Cornwall ( ensconced at Clarence House , nibbling on scones and clotted cream ) , missed Vanity Fair 's December issue at the airport . <p> On the cover : the first-ever , authorized Bob Colacello interview about Camilla and Charles . A good read , that . Then comes the sticky wicket . The cover girl ? Troubled Burberry cover girl Kate Moss : " Can She Come Back ? " And crowning ( if you will ) the cover is a sassy red headline , trumpeting : " Diana : The Last Photo Session ! " <p> Caterer Paula LeDuc , who celebrates her 25th anniversary in that biz next year , catered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's royal reception . " I did n't meet them . I worried what I wanted to say was too personal anyway , " said the chic chef , who admired the royal couple 's down-to-earthiness . " I wanted to tell them , ' I 'm so happy that you finally get to be happy ! ' " <p> During their stay , the royals also bunked at the Fairmont Hotel . But no sideways sneaking : All royal entrances and exits were conducted via the hotel 's front door . And each time , every single person in the lobby gave them a standing ovation . <p> CAPTIONS : ( 1 ) Martin Muller ( left ) , with Gottfried Helnwein and Marilyn Manson at the Modernism Gallery for the opening of Helnwein 's exhibition . / Barnaby Conrad III / Special to The Chronicle ( 2-5 ) Feliz cumpleaos : 1 Stanlee Gatti gets " danced " by actor-comedian Robin Williams at Pea Pachamama in North Beach , where a surprise birthday party was held for the event designer .
