1 <br> I sat in the tiny interview room , the back legs of my metal chair scraping against the brick wall behind me , waiting for my next client to walk in . A file -- such as it was : a manila folder containing a badly typewritten complaint ( I suspect that cops are virtually the only people left in the country who still routinely use typewriters , and they are apparently unaware of the existence of Wite-Out )  - -  lay open on the metal table in front of me , but I had n't bothered to do more than glance at it . I needed to have some idea of the police version of what 'd happened , but there was no reason for me to have it nailed down in my head , confident from past experience that the words on the police forms would have little relation to the story I would hear when Chris Delaney walked into the room . <br> I spent my working days in the criminal courthouse on Schermerhorn Street , walking distance from the Brooklyn Defenders ' office on Pierrepont . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five days a week of working out of the aging courthouse 's dark and narrow rooms across from the holding cells , conducting five-minute interviews , then heading down the hall and up to the courtroom , where my clients would enter their initial pleas . Many minor misdemeanor cases ended then and there , a plea of guilty in exchange for time served , plus maybe a small fine or community service , perhaps a treatment program if it was a first-time drug bust . These pleas meant the defendant 's main punishment was the twenty-four hours or so he 'd just spent locked up waiting to be brought before a judge . Even after half a year this still bothered me : the system took somebody who 'd just spent a more or less sleepless night on the floor of a giant holding cell , fifty other guys in the room , the court officers feeding him maybe some bologna with a drooping slice of American cheese pressed between a couple of wilted slices of white bread , and then along came a lawyer like me , telling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing could be over by copping a plea , the main punishment the experience just endured . That and a criminal record . What tired soul would n't accept that deal in exchange for getting to go home , sleep in his own bed ? <br> There was a knock on the door . " Yeah , " I called out after a second , a little thrown by the knock : many of my visitors , old hands at the game and naturally assertive to boot , did n't bother . The door opened and a young white man shuffled in . A user , no doubt about that , skin the color of dirty soap , bruise-colored puffs under both his eyes . His hair was curly and uncombed , spiraling down his face . Guy 'd blow me for a fix , I thought , feeling an immediate sharp dislike for my newest client . This happened to me at least once a day , sometimes more . I had never mentioned it to another public defender , never asked if it was just part of the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was afraid it was particular to me , especially with someone like Chris Delaney , a type I recognized in an instant , a type I 'd narrowly escaped becoming myself , if I had indeed escaped it . He 'd ended up where I 'd been heading in the weeks before Beth 's death . Of course , the cost had been high for me too , and a year later I was still paying . <br> " Have a seat , " I said , picking up the file and making a show of looking at it . " Chris Delaney , " I said . " That your name ? " <br> The kid nodded . I put Chris 's age at twenty . " I 'm Joel Deveraux , " I continued . " I 'm with the Brooklyn Defenders ' . I 'll be representing you at your arraignment . Ever been busted before , Chris ? " I asked . <br> The kid , this Chris , shook his head . " This will be more productive if you use words to communicate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Despite all the talk in the trade about client empowerment , how you should make your clients feel that they were in the driver 's seat , in my opinion that was just issuing an open invitation to a festival of bullshit . I did n't think letting clients try out an increasingly preposterous series of variations on reality was productive for anybody . It saved everybody some time and aggravation if the client understood from the beginning that I was in control . <br> " No , " Chris said . <br> " But you 've been using for a while , " I said , not putting much question into it . <br> Chris looked at me , his eyes begging . He was clearly so spent , so sick , that it was hard not to feel a tug of sympathy . But pitying junkies was like crying over every death that took place on this earth : it would be a bottomless ocean of grief . Chris seemed genuinely humiliated , though , and did n't answer . <br> " I 'm in this room every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell a junkie from a day-tripper a mile away . You may have been a dilettante once , a ' recreational user , ' but that time has passed . It 's all over your face . " <br> Chris still just looking at me , resentment seeping in and mixing with the pleading in his eyes . " Why does it matter ? " he said . <br> " It matters because I 'm going to try and get you help , " I said . " Are you ready to be helped ? " <br> Chris appeared to really consider the question . " I do n't know , " he said softly , looking at the floor . " I hope so . " <br> I glanced down again at the scant file in my hand . " Says here they snagged you up on the street . You know why ? " Phrasing the question so that it did n't assume guilt . <br> Chris shrugged . " I think they must have been watching from a rooftop or something . They picked me up two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , six other people . After they caught a couple more they drove in -- like , a whole bunch of them , cops , I mean -- and rousted the dealers . " <br> I wrote a summary of this down , not for any good reason , just to be doing something , make Chris feel like he was talking to a lawyer . " Cops say anything to you about testifying against the dealers ? " <br> " No one said shit to me , " Chris said . " Never even read me my rights . Is n't that illegal ? " <br> " They do n't really need to Mirandize you if they do n't ask you any questions , " I said . " So why do n't you tell me what happened ? From the start . " <br> " Do you want me to tell the . . . you know , the bad stuff ? " <br> " Anything you tell me is confidential , of course , " I replied . " And even at this stage , the more I know about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective I can be . " <br> Chris nodded at this . He wanted to tell , I thought : often they wanted to tell . Sometimes to confess , sometimes to brag , sometimes a mixture of the two . <br> " I was down at the projects at Avenue H and Ocean Avenue , looking to score . There 's some guys I 'm pretty regular with . Everything seemed , you know , business as usual , until I got back up to Flatbush . Suddenly these two cops are right up behind me , digging in my pockets . They just came out of nowhere , far as I could tell . " <br> " So when you bought , that was right on the street ? " <br> " They deal out of the project , but they realize guys with my skin color do n't want to go in there . That place is like a fortress or something . So they work it where you can order right on the street , even though they keep the shit in the Gardens . They take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does n't work and pretend to make a call . Somebody else comes out with the shit . " <br> I resisted the urge to nod . I knew the playbook , but that had nothing , I told myself , to do with this . " And when the cops grabbed you , you said they reached into your pockets ? " <br> Chris nodded again , with some force now . " They were both yelling , saying how they knew I had it and where was it ; all while they were grabbing at me . They did n't ask for permission to search or show a warrant or anything . " The kid again looking to suggest he 'd been the victim of some constitutional violation he knew about from TV . <br> " You in school , Chris ? " <br> Chris nodded . " At Brooklyn College . " <br> " You get federal loans ? " <br> Chris nodded again . <br> " That can be a problem , " I said . " For next year , anyway . " <br> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , his voice cracking slightly . <br> " You got any kind of criminal record at all ? " <br> " You already asked me that . " <br> " Yeah , well , " I said . " Some questions are worth repeating . " <br> Chris shook his head . " I 'm not a troublemaker . I 'm on a scholarship , taking five classes , working twenty hours a week sometimes to get by . I just need some help winding down sometimes , you know ? " <br> I had never spoken to a client about the events that had led me from graduating from one of the country 's top law schools and making over two hundred thousand dollars a year as a corporate litigator at a big firm to making under fifty thousand doing rookie PD work . There was a moment here when I was tempted , thinking that hearing it would benefit Chris , but it passed . <br> " I guess that help has paid off , " I said instead , instantly regretting it , knowing I was overcompensating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like he 'd been slapped . <br> " Okay , " I said quickly , not wanting to let the unpleasant moment I 'd created linger . " Here 's what 's going to happen now . We 'll go before the arraignment judge , who 'll ask you for a plea . From what I have here , their case against you is n't perfect , but it sounds like that 's just laziness and that they can easily fill in the gaps if they have to . You plead not guilty , you get a trial , but you also face the risk of actual jail time . You plead this out , no prior record , a college student , jail 's off the table . Depending on the judge 's mood , we should be able to get you into a treatment program . This would mean you 'd have to do NA meetings as an outpatient at a treatment center . There 's a catch to this prize , though : assuming you plead to a B misdemeanor , you 'll also be on probation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings , or if you get busted within the next year , they can reopen the charges , put you in jail . You follow that ? " <br> Chris answered with his own question : " What about my student loans ? " <br> " You wo n't be eligible for federal loans based on a drug conviction , " I said . " But your priority right now should be staying out of jail . " <br> " I ca n't afford to go to school without the loans . My dad 's on disability ; my mom works part-time . This is going to ruin my whole life . " <br> " Your life is going to be a lot more ruined if you actually go to jail , " I said . " There 're other loan programs out there . You might have to pay more interest , but that really ca n't be your focus right now . This is an easy case for them to make . It 's your call how to plead , but you said you wanted to get help , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment if you plead out . So that 's what I strongly suggest you do . " <br> Ten minutes later the two of us were standing before the judge , the bailiff reading charges . Part of my job working arraignments was to keep the easy cases from going forward . The system relied on disposing of many cases at arraignment ; it would break if most arrests in New York City proceeded past that point . In the vast majority of cases , a defense attorney 's job was really just to convince his client to take a plea . Actually going to trial was primarily reserved for those rare cases where guilt was really called into question . <br> I had grabbed the prosecutor in the hallway outside the courtroom , made my thirty-second pitch about how this Delaney kid had no record , was ready and willing for treatment , ripe for time served and some sessions as an outpatient . The ADA , a smug little prick named Diaz whom I had been dealing with at least once a week for the past half year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he 'd see what seemed reasonable . <br> Another lawyer from my office , Shelly Kennedy , was doing an arraignment -- an indecent exposure on a subway flasher -- when I walked into the courtroom . There was a steady drone of voices from the back of the room , which was nondescript and worn , the only decorations being the words " In God We Trust " behind the judge and a half dozen of the ugliest chandeliers I 'd ever seen in my life . The courthouse had been built in the 1930s and was coming apart at the seams . <br> Tired , I shut down a little during the lull as we waited , feeling a second of disorientation when Delaney 's case was called . I picked up the file and walked toward the podium , nodding at Shelly as we passed , the familiar stage fright causing my heart to pound a little and my palms to sweat , as it always did , but it did n't bother me : I knew I 'd be fine once I started talking . I looked down at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sifting through conflicting evidence , when really I was just double-checking my client 's name . I had a pathological fear of calling a client by the wrong name . I 'd never actually done it myself , but I 'd seen it happen more than once . To me , this was the bluntest possible reminder of the assembly-line nature of the work we did here , and I did n't think I 'd be able to stand it if I ever made that mistake . <br> Two court officers brought Delaney over to stand beside me . One stood behind him , the other next to him . Delaney held his hands behind his back like he was handcuffed . ADA Diaz stated his name and office for the record , and I did the same . Then Diaz did his spiel , which I barely bothered to listen to , using the time to prepare what I was going to say . <br> " Your Honor , " I began when my turn came , my voice going a half octave deeper , as it always did in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any crime . He is willing to concede that he has a problem with substance abuse , and he would very much like to receive help for this . This is not a case where any term of imprisonment is warranted . If the state will agree to a B misdemeanor plea for probation and entry into an outpatient program , not only will justice have been amply done , but my client will have been genuinely helped . " <br> Judge Davis looked over at Diaz , who was reading his own file on the case . " Counsel ? " she said , wanting to see if the state would agree . <br> A long moment passed . At last the ADA looked up at the judge . " This does seem like a case where probation and outpatient could be warranted , " he said . <br> Judge Davis nodded , turning her attention toward Chris . " Mr. Delaney , is it your intention to plead guilty to the charges against you in order to get the sentence just discussed ? " <br> Chris looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever in a hurry to plead guilty . The defendants were usually a step behind at arraignment , except for the old pros , the **26;741;TOOLONG winners who were in and out of the system all the time . I cupped a hand over Chris 's ear and whispered : " You have to plead guilty to get the deal . Otherwise you have to plead not guilty , and then we go from there . " <br> Chris considered this , then looked back at the judge and nodded . <br> " You have to say the words , " Judge Davis said . " Is it your intention to plead guilty ? " <br> " Yes , " Chris said . " I plead guilty . " <br> " And is that because you are , in fact , guilty ? " <br> Chris nodded again , then caught himself . " Yes , " he said , adding tentatively , " Your Honor . " <br> And it was all over but the paperwork . Once the judge had accepted the plea and the bailiff was calling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens next ? " <br> " What happens next is you leave this building , get yourself a nice meal , and go sleep in your own bed . You 've got to pay a processing fine but it can wait , and they will contact you directly about the outpatient meetings . The most important thing for you to keep in mind is that this whole deal blows up if you get busted again -- for anything -- in the next year . The state will be able to just tear this up and charge you all over again . You understand ? " <br> " Yeah , " Chris said absently , but I could n't tell if he was really listening . I had no idea how many of these deals did ultimately blow up -- so far as I knew , nobody bothered to keep track . Everyone too busy just keeping the system running to bother tracking whether it was actually working or not . <br> I walked Chris out of the courtroom , shook his hand , uttered the usual spiel about staying out of trouble and going to the required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and I was free to take my paperwork back to the Brooklyn Defenders and call it a day . <br> Continues ...
