For couples considering in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) , the high cost of repeated attempts and the chance of having multiple babies are often cause for hesitation . But new research at the Sher Institutes of Reproductive Medicine suggests that there could soon be a test to identify which embryos are most likely to be successfully implanted . Such a test would reduce the number of tries needed to achieve pregnancy and allow doctors to implant fewer embryos , lowering the odds of having quadruplets or triplets . Sher doctors found that embryos that produce a high level of the genetic marker sHLA-G gave women a better than 60% pregnancy success rate  --  nearly double the current national average for IVF . The marker can be easily detected in the fluid surrounding each embryo.
