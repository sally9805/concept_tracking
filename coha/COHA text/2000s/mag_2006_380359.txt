As Congress geared up for this week 's hearings on the Sago mine accident , which killed 12 coalworkers earlier this month , disaster struck another West Virginia mine . A fire at Alma No. 1 last week left two people dead  --  and put new pressure on the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration ( MSHA ) , which regulates mining operations . House Democrats are asking whether MSHA oversight has been not only weaker but also more secretive under the Bush Administration . Sago was cited for 208 alleged safety violations in 2005 , Alma No. 1 for 95 . In the past , the MSHA made its inspectors ' full notes public , but since 2004 , it has released only briefer citations . Critics say the inspectors ' notes provide more information on conditions in dangerous mines . Representative Henry Waxman , top Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee , has sent a letter to Labor Secretary Elaine Chao  --  whose department oversees the MSHA  --  arguing that if the inspector notes for the Sago citations had been disclosed , " it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place . " Waxman tells TIME , " The Administration 's obsession with secrecy is literally endangering lives . " Mine-inspection officials dispute such allegations , insisting enough information on safety infractions is made public . An MSHA official explained that the policy change made procedures " consistent with those of other enforcement agencies . "
