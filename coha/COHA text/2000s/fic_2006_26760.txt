Framed By Frank Cottrell Boyce HarperCollins Publishers , Inc . Frank Cottrell Boyce You 've probably never heard of Vincenzo Perugia . But we know all about him . He was a famous art thief and we used to be in the same line of work . My sister Minnie even had a picture of him on her bedroom wall . She reckons that when Vincenzo stole the Mona Lisa from the Louvre museum in Paris on August 21 , 1911 , that was the most immensely perfect crime ever . The Mona Lisa was the world 's most famous painting , but Vincenzo did such a neat job no one even noticed it was missing for two days . Then they did notice , and everything went mental . Everyone went to the Louvre to look at the empty space where the painting had been . They lined up to look at an empty space ! Even Vincenzo Perugia lined up . And when they got to the front of the line , they all looked at that empty space and thought about what used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and afterward you ca n't stop looking at the place where it used to be . And all this time Vincenzo had it in his little room -- the Mona Lisa was in a trunk next to the bed . Sometimes he took the painting out and played it funny songs on his mandolin . He did n't try to sell it . He did n't steal any other paintings . He did n't want to be famous or rich . He just wanted the Mona Lisa . And that 's where he went right . That 's why it was the perfect crime.Because he did n't want anything else . And that 's probably where we went wrong . We wanted something .

Like the time when we were at Prestatyn and Minnie wanted a swim but I would n't get in the water because it was too cold . She kept saying , " Come in . It 's fine once you 're in . " And I kept saying , " No . " Dad got up , went to the trailer and came back with a kettle of boiling water . He poured the water in the sea and said , " Dylan , come and test it . Tell me if it 's all right or does it need a bit more ? " I said , " No , that 's fine now , thanks , Da . " " Sure now ? " " Sure now . " " Not too hot then ? " " No , just right . " " Give me a shout . If it gets cold again , I can always boil up some more . " Then Minnie splashed me and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun went down . He fixed the sea for us . Now that is a thing to be admired . My big sister , Marie , never came in the water even after Dad fixed it . She said , " Have you any idea what sea water can do to your hair ? " And later on when we were playing Monopoly in the trailer , she said , " Did you really think that one kettle of water could warm up the entire Irish Sea ? " I said , " Not the whole sea , obviously . Just the bit we were swimming in . " " Yeah , like that would really work , " said Minnie . " Let me explain the physics . . . " " Minnie , " said Mam , " Euston Road . Three houses . Two hundred and seventy pounds , please . " Typical of Mam , by the way , cleverly changing the subject like that . Obviously I know now that the kettle did n't warm up the sea , but that 's not the point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dad looked at that situation and he thought , I ca n't do anything about the physics , but I can do something about Dylan . So he did . He 's keen for us all to learn how to fix things too . That 's how I came to be helping him with the oil change on Ms. Stannard 's blue Fiesta ( top speed 110 mph ) . I do n't know how I came to make the mix-up about the oil . Dad said it would probably be best if I did n't go near the workshop again . Or near a car again , really . He was quite calm about it . He said it was the kind of thing that could happen to anyone . Anyone who did n't know the difference between motor oil and antifreeze , that is . After that , Mam said I could take over the petrol log . That 's the massive red book next to the till where we write down all the petrol sales so we can track supply and demand . The book is red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a Bible . Mam got it in a trunk sale ( Trunk Crazy at the Dynamo Blaenau Soccer Club ground ) for fifty pence . It 's got over a thousand pages . We only use about a page a week , so it should last us twenty years . Bargain ! No disrespect to Mam , obviously , but she was probably too busy with the new baby to make the most of that job . She just wrote stuff like , " 10:20 a.m.  - -  four gallons unleaded . " Whereas I put down all the detail -- the make , the year , name of the driver , anything . I 'd stay out on the asphalt forecourt in front of the shop from after school till teatime . Sometimes Nice Tom would come and sit with me , and if he said something like , " Mr. Morgan 's back left tire is baldy , " I 'd put that down too .
