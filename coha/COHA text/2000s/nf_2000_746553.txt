Section : PROFILE Beth Ann Faragher is a lawyer who is also a citation . The mix puts a new spin on how she sees her clients and her job . <p> In Beth Ann Faragher 's fantasy she 's arguing a matter m court and says , We , your honor , in my case , Faragher v. Boca Raton ... " But in reality , she 's still waiting for her dollar . <p> Before she started law school in 1990 , Faragher sued the south Florida city for sexual harassment she endured for several years working as a lifeguard . After she finished law school , the case went to trial . Now the Denver criminal defense attorney 's name is a case name , one that frequently rolls off the tongues of professors , students , employment lawyers and whoever else might need to refer to the U.S. Supreme Court 's definitive answer to the question of employer liability in sexual harassment claims : Faragher v. City of Boca Raton , 118 S. Ct . 2275 ( 1998 ) . <p> It 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 33-year-old Faragher . She had won in federal District Court , albeit only a nominal dollar back when punitive damages were not allowed in Title VII Civil Rights Act cases . That award was overturned by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals at Atlanta ; then last June the Supreme Court remanded the case to the appeals court to enter judgment for her . <p> For anyone , following in the paths of once-ordinary people now remembered as names and cases , such as Plessy , Gideon or Griswold , would change a life . For someone bound to become a lawyer , it would help shape a practice . <p> While handling case after case herself , with so many of them reduced over time to numbing , faceless italics , Faragher has seen the law from both sides  --  as a person and a case . The combination , she says , has helped her understand both . <p> Except for Faragher the case , Faragher the woman would be just another lawyer toiling at just another job , working for a private firm on contract with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misdemeanor cases . <p> Her sideline of late , though , has been giving speeches about her case to various groups , such as Inns of Court , employment lawyer associations and , last spring , at a packed news conference held in Washington , D.C. , by the National Organization for Women . <p> Faragher is not a name partner at Denver 's Vitek &; Doniger , but she is a name in the law . It 's an unusual perch for a lawyer who handles thousands of cases a year , hundreds of trials , none of them likely to end up at the highest court . The utilitarian misdemeanor courtrooms in which Faragher works bear little resemblance to the capacious , ornate ones in which Faragher was tried and argued on appeals . <p> Ironically for the name plaintiff in a landmark sexual harassment case , Faragher represents mostly men , mostly in domestic abuse cases . But also in the mix are prostitution , shoplifting , petty theft , trespassing , loitering , even dogs running at large . <p> " The ones I get most attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong system , " Faragher says . " Sometimes I can get their cases dismissed and have them sent to a hospital for medication and counseling . " <p> Those matters bring few , if any , calls from news reporters . Which made it all the more unusual a year ago when she was contacted at work by one for the Chicago Tribune . He wanted her reaction to having her case accepted by the Supreme Court . <p> " That was the first I heard about it , " she says . " I was shocked . My feeling had been , ' No one gets cert to the Supreme Court . ' " <p> It was the first of hundreds of reporters ' queries as the case worked its way through decision by the Supreme Court this past June . The Road Begins <p> Faragher certainly had n't dreamed of such things back in the late 1980s , while working as a lifeguard at the Boca Raton beaches to help pay her way through Florida Atlantic University there . For several years , Faragher and a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the boorish harassment from their supervisor and his lieutenant . <p> The two men 's snide sexual comments were virtually nonstop , along with gropes and grabs of the women 's buttocks and like behavior . Once , one of them tackled Faragher on the beach and declared , in so many words , that he would have sex with her if she were more buxom . <p> Before Faragher , such behavior by supervisors was considered by many courts to be " frolics " or " detours " from job duties under traditional agency theory , and employers unaware of it were not liable . The rationale was that the harassment was beyond anything related to a business purpose and was personally motivated . <p> In Faragher , Justice David Souter wrote for the majority that " an employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate ( or successively higher ) authority over the employee . " Before the Court <p> Faragher 's presence in the Court the day her case was heard was doubly significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amlong of Boca Raton 's six-lawyer Amlong &; Amlong , moved her admission as a lawyer before the Court . <p> Some critics in the news media called it a stunt and pointed out that several justices seemed uncomfortable when they apparently realized the lawyer they were swearing in to be able to practice before them was about to have her own case argued before them . <p> " I was watching Chief Justice William Rehnquist and he said something as I stood up , I 'm not sure what , " recalls Faragher . " And someone told me later that Justice Sandra Day O'Connor leaned over and whispered to another justice . " <p> While Faragher says that having her case argued at the High Court was like an out-of-body experience , apparently the justices are so used to dealing in disembodied cases  --  theory rather than living , breathing persons  --  that they were taken aback by a nonitalic Faragher standing before them . <p> Still , for Faragher the young lawyer , her day in court was both a thrill and an odd detour from professional life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coin " as a party in a case rather than the lawyer . <p> " It was interesting sitting there listening to the justices talk about the behavior of these two men , " Faragher says . " Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg kept referring to it as ' these deeds . ' It was strange having these incredibly powerful people asking questions about my case , talking about what happened to me . " <p> Faragher had intended all along to go to the High Court to see her case argued , arid had plenty of time to plan for it . <p> It had n't been so simple when it first went to trial in 1994 and her presence was necessary . Faragher got word on a Monday morning , on the telephone in the Denver courtroom where she was trying a case , that she had to be in Florida to begin trial the next day . <p> " I had to get a $600 , one-way plane ticket right away , " she recalls . In all , she 's probably spent $3,000 on travel and expenses for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's been worth it , Faragher says . <p> " She was never in it for any money , " says Amlong , her lawyer , whom Faragher met when he was giving a talk to the NOW chapter in Boca Raton . " She did n't see herself as the Joan of Arc of the women 's movement , either . When it became clear the city was going to blow this off with a slap on the wrists of the supervisors , she just said , ' This is n't fight , ' and filed her EEOC claim . <p> " She wanted somebody to do something about it , and boy , did they , " Amlong adds . <p> Amlong says that under Faragher he can eventually revisit a state-law claim in the case for which Faragher was awarded $10,000 but that was thrown out because of the then-unsettled liability issue . The 11th Circuit , though , had yet to enter judgment in the Title VII case remanded by the Supreme Court . <p> " So I 'm still waiting for my dollar , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Her case played out in the U.S. Supreme Court . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : During arguments in Faragher 's sexual harassment case , " It was strange having these incredibly powerful people ... talking about what happened to me , " she says . <p> By TERRY CARTER <p> <p> Terry Carter is a reporter for the ABA Journal .
