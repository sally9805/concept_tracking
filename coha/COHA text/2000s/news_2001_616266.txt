<p> David and Carla Wilson could get their daughter back any time . Just agree to conditions that a judge set , and 7-year-old Erica immediately comes home . <p> That seemingly simple act would keep the Wilsons from losing their oldest child forever . It would keep Erica from being offered for adoption by a new set of parents . <p> But , like others from the House of Prayer , the Wilsons wo n't do it . <p> They ca n't , they say . <p> " We love our daughter , " David Wilson says . " We love the Lord more . He gave us a daughter , and I know in due time he 's going to give her back to us . " <p> " We know , " his wife adds , " to leave it in the Lord 's hands . " <p> After a four-month impasse over an abuse investigation at the northwest Atlanta church , state child welfare officials say they 're tired of such intransigence . <p> The state Division of Family and Children Services says it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of Prayer children it is holding in protective custody . If the parents want their children back , it 's up to them to make the next move . <p> Agency sets conditions <p> The parents are n't budging . So more than ever , the children are caught in the middle of a dispute that apparently ca n't be resolved . <p> " I do n't know what else we can do , " says Andy Boisseau , a DFCS spokesman . " We ca n't force the kids back on them . <p> " If the parents respond negatively , " he says , " I think the course of events is that DFCS would then go back to court to sever parental rights and make them eligible for long-term foster care and/or adoption . " <p> The church and DFCS have been battling since late February , when allegations surfaced of systematic abuse of the congregation 's children . The agency ultimately took 49 children from six families into protective custody , dragging some of them from their homes in full view of television news cameras . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the parents chances to end the dispute . The parents were told they could get their children back if they accepted a few conditions : They could n't use corporal punishment if it left marks on the child . They could n't allow their 14- and 15-year-old daughters to leave the state to get married . They could n't keep their children at church so late they had to miss school the next day . <p> Repeatedly , the parents refused . <p> Allegations evaporate <p> Then on May 25 , DFCS blinked . After acknowledging it had evidence that no more than five children , and perhaps as few as three , had been abused , it let 34 of the 49 children go home without requiring their parents to agree to any conditions . It said the other 15 needed more psychological tests , and the agency now says they ca n't be released without assurances  --  signed by the parents  --  that they wo n't be abused . <p> But the parents continue to refuse all proposed deals . <p> If necessary , they say , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They want us to compromise our religion , and we ca n't do that , " says the Rev. Arthur Allen Jr. , who as the House of Prayer 's pastor exerts enormous influence over his congregants . <p> " If we lose faith with our God , they become our god . I guess Satan feels like for our children , we will renege . But whether it 's for our lives or for our children , we 're not going to renege on our faith . " <p> Allen disputes reports from DFCS that three of the 15 children do n't want to come home . He says he repeatedly hears from the children still in custody that they support the hard line he has taken . <p> He shares a letter he received from 15-year-old Adrienne Smith , who is in a DeKalb County foster home with her sister , Stacy , 14 . <p> " I love you so very much , " Adrienne wrote to Allen and his wife , Trina . " You all have been a blessing to me and also my family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed together . . . . God knows I love you all and also miss you all . I want to come home as soon as God says so . " <p> On July 3 , the day after Allen received the letter , the sisters ran away from the foster home . After what Allen calls a weeklong " vacation , " the pastor sent them back to the foster home . <p> The extended absence of all 15 children , Allen says , has taken a toll on the families divided by DFCS . <p> " It 's like you 're holding things in you , " he says of the parents . " Once you start crying , you ca n't quit . Once it breaks loose , it 'll just keep running . The sorrow they 're holding , they could n't control it if they ever let go .

Then they seek deliverance for their older brother and sister . <p> Deandra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custody , even though their six younger siblings were released in May . <p> " We count it as a blessing to have them home , " Yolanda Wilson says of the younger children . " But there 's an empty spot there . Our family 's not complete . " <p> That 's especially true , Wilson and her husband say , since the family moved into a new house , provided by their church . Deandra and Ricky Jr . have never seen it , and their absence looms large . <p> The couple 's 4-year-old , Andrew , often asks about Ricky Jr. , his mother says . <p> " He knows certain things , " she says . " They all know their sister 's not there , their brother 's not there . They miss them . " <p> And the children still show signs  --  some of them physical  --  of their time in protective custody . <p> The Wilsons ' son Tyler , 3 , has a 3-inch scar on his neck from a wound he suffered while in foster care . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His father says if it had happened at home , he and his wife would have been charged with child abuse . <p> But he says , " Who do you report DFCS to ? " <p> DFCS has denied that any House of Prayer children were harmed in foster care . <p> ' No evidence of abuse ' <p> Like other House of Prayer members , the Wilsons are contemptuous of DFCS . They refuse to take their children for psychological therapy , as the agency has demanded . And they are trying to compile documents to prove their claim that social workers fabricated the abuse charges against them . <p> On a hot afternoon , Ricky Wilson leaves his spot in the shade outside his new house and retrieves a thick folder from his car . <p> Inside the folder is a statement from his children 's doctor at Grady Memorial Hospital . On March 13 , after social workers took the Wilson children into custody , Dr. B.J. Steele wrote : " I have personally reviewed their medical records and there is no evidence of abuse in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill Elementary , the school that Deandra and Ricky Jr . attended before they went into foster care . <p> One page reports that Deandra made the honor roll in third grade . Another shows she earned rewards for her reading . Deandra and Ricky Jr . both made good grades  --  A 's , B 's , the occasional C. <p> In the first half of the 2000-2001 school year , the papers show , Deandra missed three days ; Ricky Jr. , five . The papers seem to contradict claims by DFCS that the Wilsons frequently kept their children from attending school . <p> Still , the Wilsons remain somewhat passive about their older children 's future  --  even the possibility they will be put up for adoption . <p> " We leave everything in the Lord 's hands , " Ricky Wilson says . " The Lord knows what 's best for our children . " <p> " God has the final say over everything , " his wife says . <p> Their strategy , Ricky Wilson says , is simple : " Trust in the Lord . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " We 're not losing .

" <p> Girl wants to come home <p> David and Carla Wilson have not visited Erica in foster care . It would be too painful , they say  --  for the child and for the parents . <p> But they occasionally talk to Erica by phone , and they say she wants to come home . Her siblings are just as eager for her return . <p> " Her brothers and sister ask all the time when she 's coming home , " David Wilson says . " It 's hard . But the Lord , he 's holding us up . We know it 's a matter of time . She 'll be back . All of them will be back .

" We do n't just whip our children . We love our children . I 'm not going to let nobody abuse my children . " <p> Even before DFCS took the House of Prayer 's children , David Wilson says , he and other parents used other approaches besides corporal punishment . Spanking , he says , was always " the last resort . " <p> But a few times since his youngest children returned home in May , David Wilson says , he has had to take that step . <p> " You 've got to have discipline , " he says . " If you do n't have discipline , you do n't have nothing .
