Section : THE Pastel PAGE <p> Colorado artist Dee Toscano has enjoyed a long , distinguished career as an artist . Her paintings have won numerous awards and grace countless private and public collections . Her large bronze sculptures adorn churches and schools in Colorado , New Mexico , Washington state , and as far away as Florence , Italy . In 1987 , she received the prestigious designation of master pastelist from the Pastel Society of America . Her name is well-known to galleries , museums , and collectors specializing in Western art . Yet despite this success , Toscano approaches her work lightly , with an eye for fun and an unwillingness to take herself too seriously . " Art has been very good to me , " she explains . " I never set any big goals . If I had , I think I would have missed all the time . I 'm not trying to achieve anything with my art ; I 'm trying to enjoy it . I take my work lightly , more so now than I did years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am an artist , but that 's not who I am . " <p> Toscano moves back and forth between painting and sculpting as the mood strikes her . " When I 'm tired of painting , " she explains , " I switch to clay and vice versa . Sometimes I paint and sculpt simultaneously . I do n't deliberately schedule any of this . " Toscano is a free spirit who instinctively dislikes schedules , rules , and plans . She attributes this in part to her lack of formal training . " I 'm absolutely self-taught , " she says . " I think for me it was the easy way . I did n't have to sit through all the lectures and all the academic exercises . I used to regret not having that opportunity , but then as the years passed I became comfortable with my lack of formal training . " <p> Born in Texas , Toscano was an only child who entertained herself by sketching . She did n't think being able to draw was anything special , so it was only later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that other people thought she had talent . " I did n't think much about art , " she recalls , " until I saw an advertisement offering a hundred dollars or a scholarship to the person who could best draw Abraham Lincoln . I wanted the money but won the scholarship . Disappointed , I reentered many months later and won the money . My career since then has evolved beyond my comprehension . I had no grand design to be a portrait painter ; I only knew I had to paint . So while raising a family , I taught myself . " <p> As a young wife and mother , she painted on the kitchen table as time permitted . Her first sale was a watercolor of two swans done on a brown paper bag . A neighbor bought it for $10 . Yet for Toscano art has never been about money or prestige . It has always been about magic . " You know the magic that happens sometimes when you 're painting , " she asks , " and it 's almost like you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every color is perfect ? It 's as if you were watching yourself work . " <p> For Toscano , the magic always starts with a face . " Portraits are the first paintings I ever did . There was never any question about what subject matter I was going to paint . It was always faces , and it still is . I have to force myself to do something else . Faces are my passion . " <p> Toscano 's portraits are known for their luminous color . Jill With Green Pillows , for example , features a cool figure against a warm background . The palette is limited , ranging from greenish blue to yellow-green , all of which set off the warm reds and oranges of the figure 's hair and skin . Although this color orchestration is subtle in concept and sophisticated in execution , the painting owes its strength more to Toscano 's daring decision to throw the face almost entirely in shadow . This treatment not only heightens the pensive , almost regretful expression of the figure , but also creates a larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a counterpoint to the shape of the figure itself . The resulting tensions between light and dark , and abstraction and representation , are responsible for the piece 's impact . <p> Although Toscano 's work shows great variety in style and technique , strong values and design are a constant . Sometimes the light is from the side , sometimes from the front or rear , but it is almost always strong light , and the shadows it casts provide the underlying structure of her work . Her colors are luminous , but they are made so in large measure by her dramatic use of light and dark . Toscano 's paintings also exhibit lively crosshatching and calligraphy on top of multiple layers of broadly applied color . The layers create depth and luminosity ; the line work , liveliness and lyricism . <p> Although Toscano carefully and precisely models her faces , she characteristically renders the rest of the figure and the background with loose , energetic strokes . " The background is not important , " she stresses . " It 's just a setting . I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors from the subject and simply mix them together in the background . Using the same colors ties the painting together . I let the viewer 's imagination figure out what 's going on back there . " <p> In choosing subjects for her portraits , Toscano is particularly drawn to the color and drama of various ethnic groups and native costumes . She is known in particular for her sensitive paintings of Indian peoples from the Southwest , Mexico , and South America . This work has been much sought after and has made her well-known to collectors of Western art . Toscano is not entirely comfortable with the label , however . " I 've done a lot of classical pieces over the years , " she remarks . Jill With Green Pillows and the still life Grape Irises attest to her versatility . <p> At one time , many years ago , Toscano regularly worked on commissioned portraits , but she gave that up because , as she explained , when you paint a commissioned portrait , the sitter 's entire family become critics . This limited her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although Toscano still works occasionally from live models , particularly family and friends , she more often works from photos taken on her extensive travels through Europe , South America , and Asia . She has 10,000 slides in all . " I enjoy painting on location , " she explains , " but I ca n't seem to find the time . I work from photos as well as life because I ca n't always have models . I try to compose with the camera so I do n't have to spend a lot of time later . I work rapidly . I do everything rapidly . I rarely know ahead of time whether a painting will be tight or loose . I just go along for the ride . I think that 's the fun of it . It keeps me and my work fresh . My paintings do n't all look alike . " <p> Toscano does n't have the patience for preliminary sketches or value studies , or other elaborate planning . " No preliminary sketches for me , " she says . " That 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slides on a large blank wall in her studio and draws directly from them onto her sheets of pastel paper . Sometimes , for special effect , she projects them on brightly colored paper taped to the wall . " That gives me a ' mother ' color , " she says . " For example , if I project a slide on a yellow sheet , it takes on a whole new personality . The overtones are all yellow . It 's magical what happens . It gives the painting an entirely different tone . " <p> She works rapidly , slowing only to draw the face carefully , using line only , with no shading . " I always start with the face , " she says . " When I know it 's right , I 'm free to let loose on the rest of the painting . If it 's not fight , if I 'm not connecting with it , I wo n't continue . " <p> Toscano prefers to paint on sanded pastel paper . On occasion she has prepared her own , but normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have worked on Canson Mi-Teintes papers , " she adds , " but they do n't hold as much pigment as the sanded papers I prefer . " <p> Toscano favors medium to soft square pastels , such as those manufactured by Holbein . She uses the squared sides to lay down broad swaths of color . " If I want fine detail , I use Conte or pastel pencils . They give a light feathery or airy look over established patterns of color . " <p> Toscano prefers crosshatching to blending because the texture adds freshness and depth , and the colors stay lively . For crosshatching , she cuts a series of grooves along the long edge of her pastel sticks by dragging them several times along the edge of a board attached to her easel for that purpose . This enables her to create parallel lines with a single stroke . The artist rarely uses fixative , believing with many others that it dulls the colors . When she finishes a painting , she takes it immediately to her framer . <p> Toscano turned to pastels some 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She discovered that she loved the medium 's speed and spontaneity and never looked back . She also claims that pastels are the easiest medium to master because every color you could possibly require is available premixed and ready to apply . Perhaps , but mastery such as Toscano 's is won only by years of painting , making mistakes , and painting some more . <p> " I believe that everyone can paint , " she says . " I really do . If you do n't get too technical and do n't get bogged down in all the dos and don'ts , it can set you free . It 's amazing what you can do when there are no absolutes .
