<p> The day Al grew up is the day the linebacker died . Al turned 30 that day , dirty 30 , and he had planned to do what $ 105 million men always do  --  whatever he damn pleased . Except it went nothing like that . Not that cold , wet , cathartic Miami day . <p> The night before , he had been antsy . He had done a photo shoot with his wife , his tall , pregnant wife . At 10:30 p.m. , he had told her he would see her later at home . <p> " Where you headed ? " she asked . <p> " To get my birthday present , " Al said . <p> " I 'm hungry , " she said . <p> " So am I , " he said . <p> Al was craving his present , a present he had ordered seven months before , a present only a rich man could give himself , a present that arrived in bubble wrap , a present he thought he deserved for reaching the big three-oh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made it . <p> Twenty years before , as a 10-year-old , he went with his parents to court and told them that he could n't bear to see them fight and that they could n't have him anymore . And 15 years before , as a 15-year-old , he had been taller than his junior-high principal , had worn clothes that fit only two-thirds of him and had been called " goofy " and " garbage " by classmates . And 10 years before , as a 20-year-old , he had fallen in love with his biceps during his first trip to a weight room , and none of Lou Carnesecca 's players was going to push him around again . And two years before , as a 28-year-old , Larry Johnson had cheap-shotted him , and Al had swung back with an overhand right . Once again , he was an angry , irresponsible player , costing his team a season . <p> But now he had made it , damn it . Now he had made it to three-oh , and he pulled up to an auto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He asked for his present , and they handed over the keys to the fastest car he had seen . <p> " So this is what an Aston Martin looks like , " Al said , and he and his good friend Andre hopped in the olive-green convertible and drove into the Miami night . <p> Al had it up to 90 mph by the stroke of midnight . He smiled his crooked smile , and he brought it back to the dealer because he had noticed an odor in the car . The dealer said , " Well , that 's because you still have the parking brake on . " <p> Al howled with laughter . He dropped Andre off , and Andre said , " Happy birthday , man . " Then he said one other thing : " Why do n't you ever wear your seat belt ? " <p> Al said nothing . What could he say ? He took off for his home in Coconut Grove with the convertible top down . Crossing the Rickenbacker Causeway , he had it up to 120 mph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , wind in his eyes , it dawned on him that if he ever wrecked this little car , he would be dead in an instant because the impact of the crash would go straight to him . <p> The next morning  --  the morning of his birthday  --  he drove to practice as it poured a heavy Miami rain . After practice , someone told him the news , the news that would numb him , the news that his friend Derrick Thomas , the Kansas City Chiefs linebacker who recently had been in a wicked car crash , was dead at 33 . **25;935;TOOLONG dead . Dead like Al 's other friend who had been in a wreck , Bobby Phills . <p> Al heard this , drove his Aston Martin to his favorite diner and stared at the car through the diner window . The thrill was gone . He thought about the never-been-used seat belts , about his 3-year-old son , about his smart , witty , pregnant , voluptuous wife , and said no way . He drove to the dealership , handed over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months for , gave it back after 15 hours . And he told them to come get his Porsche , too . Then he went home on his 30th birthday and went to bed . <p> He slept two hours . When his wife stepped softly into their master bedroom , she asked him where the fast little cars were . Al told her his story , then rolled over . And she knew her husband was all grown up then , and she cried while he could n't see , cried in the dark . <p> So do n't expect Alonzo Mourning to melt down this spring , not again , not during the playoffs , not when Larry Johnson or Matt Geiger or someone else elbows him in the kidney . It used to be a question of when , not if , Mourning would lose his head . But he is no longer a man the Miami Heat worry about . The team is probably not athletic enough or healthy enough to win the NBA title , but at least its All-Star center comes in peace . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Andre Napier , a friend and business associate who helps organize Mourning 's summer charity event . " People swing at him or trash-talk , and he just smiles . If he had a flower , he 'd give it to them . " <p> He still owns the scowl , the Georgetown scowl he learned from Patrick Ewing , and he still runs to his own angry little corner of the world after each Heat loss . But he is now the man he wants to be , the man Fannie Threet raised him to be , the man she and only she calls " Al . " <p> His journey has been a contentious one , and that 's why he has been one of the more despised players in the NBA . In this most recent All-Star Game , he dunked on Rasheed Wallace and immediately was approached by the one man in the league with more muscle mass than he has , Shaquille O'Neal . <p> " Why do you have to be so mean ? " O'Neal said . " Lighten up a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mourning told him . " I 'm just out here playing the game like I 've played it all my life . You just got to get to know me better before you pass judgment . " <p> Both of them laughed , but it showed once again that an entire league has misjudged him . <p> " With Alonzo , it 's a case of people taking a sound bite out of his life and using it to define him , " says John Thompson , his former Georgetown coach . " And the thing I resent is they think he 's a thug . Alonzo was never a thug . He 's got a degree . People just do n't know him . " <p> No , they do n't know that he refuses alcohol during the season , that he has memorized every referee 's first name , that the NBA wives just honored him for his tireless work with foster children , that he has wept in Heat coach Pat Riley 's office or that he giggled when his little son asked him , " Daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do not know that his wife , Tracy , still has his original love letters , that he calls two women " Mom " and two men " Pop , " that he 's a Scrabble fanatic or that he played listlessly against the Knicks in a nationally televised game in February because his son was in the hospital that day with pneumonia . <p> " It 's true , players in this league have n't known me or liked me in the past , " Mourning says . " Their perception of me was an edgy , mean guy who wanted to fight every time I hit the court . But it was n't that way . <p> " Of course , if I was on the outside looking in , I would 've had the same perception . I had an **38;962;TOOLONG mentality . But I was just trying to prove myself , do n't you see ? I always had to prove myself . If you knew about my childhood , you 'd know why . And that 's why I have the scowl , I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At 30 . I think I have arrived . It took awhile , but I 'm here . You know ? " <p> It was a brick house in Chesapeake , Va. , with four bedrooms and a chalkboard . He waltzed in there as an 11-year-old shopping for a family , and he knew he was safe as soon as he met the lady with the grin . Her name was Fannie Threet , a former English and math teacher who had seen 40-odd foster children walk into her house with the same traces of fear . She told him she would love for him to stay , so he stayed . And when Mourning says today he has led a " storybook life , " he 's referring first and foremost to her , the woman who taught him how to like himself . <p> He calls her " Mom " and her husband " Pop , " but there 's also a set of parents he kicked to the side of the road , a set of parents who started him on his angry way 20 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life were unbearable . Alonzo Mourning Sr. and his wife , Julia , did their best not to argue in front of him . Their marriage might have been in decline , but they still took loving photographs of their son at a Chesapeake jungle gym , bought him Washington Redskins sheets and pillow cases and made sure he got to see the original " Star Wars . " <p> But his father was around less and less , the arguing grew in increments and he first learned the term " divorce " at age 10 . He says he wanted to live with both of them and could n't choose , so he chose neither . But it is hardly that simple . He was mad , madder than they or he ever imagined , and those who know him say he wanted to spite them because he was stubborn and because he wanted to say " up yours " to this divorce thing . <p> They sat in a child-custody court , and he testified he wanted to live in a foster home . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mourning says . " You 're just sitting in court and telling the judge what you want , and they make the decision from there . It was disturbing , very disturbing . I was confused , but I was kind of adamant on what I wanted . I knew I did n't want to show any type of favoritism toward my mother or father , and I made the decision I would rather leave , do this on my own . . . . I just was n't happy with the situation . <p> " But it happened so long ago that I ca n't really picture the whole thing and do n't really want to get into a lot of it . And my parents do not talk about it , even today . I just remember that I went in and let the courts decide my fate . " <p> The judge placed him in a group home for a year  --  " My only memory is that I was with a lot of kids looking for answers , " he says  --  but the court also promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Fannie Threet stepped in with her brick house and her chalkboard . <p> The first time he confided in her , really confided in her , it had to do with his height . At 13 , he was 6-4 and had tried playing football to no avail . He would trip over his elongated feet trying to rush the passer and would play in high-tops because he did n't own cleats . And he remembers children being cruel . <p> He went home in tears to Threet , who said , " Al , please sit down , and let 's talk . " She told him God had blessed him , that he should walk with his head high , work hard and expect wonderful things . The day he gave up football for hoops was one of those wonderful things . <p> Anxious not to be ridiculed again , anxious to prove the divorce had n't turned him into a big nothing , he worked night and day at basketball . This was where his work ethic started . This is why Riley later would fall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being rainy , cold , miserable , " says Bud Threet , Mourning 's foster brother . " And he 'd be out the door to play ball . Could n't stop him . " <p> His coach at Indian River High in Chesapeake , Bill Lassiter , took it from there , took a fuming man-child and taught him the game . Lassiter was a disciple of John McLendon Jr. , who was a disciple of James Naismith at Kansas . McLendon had pioneered small-college black basketball in the South , and Lassiter asked him to speak to his prize pupil . McLendon told Mourning , " You have to grow up fast , son . You are more than a high school athlete . You can not hang out like the rest of the kids . " <p> But Mourning belonged to Fannie Threet , so there was no need to worry . He was one of 49 foster children she had raised in that brick house over the years , and she made him sit by her chalkboard and do his homework after every practice . She never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross her , and by the time he had graduated and enrolled at Georgetown , Lassiter had yet to see Mourning scowl . <p> But the real world can be a bitch . And when Mourning tried out for the 1988 Olympic team the summer after he left Fannie Threet , he was the next-to-last player cut . It devastated him . Thompson , the team 's coach , had cut him because he did n't want him missing his freshman classes , but that 's how the scowl began . <p> " I got cut , and I had to prove myself  --  like junior high all over again , " he says . <p> That 's when a D.C. drug dealer named Rayful Edmond III began knocking on Mourning 's door , and Mourning made the foolish , naive decision to befriend him . Edmond did n't want to sell Mourning any drugs ; Edmond just wanted a sniff of the exalted Hoya experience . When his drug runners would get murdered , Edmond would bury them in Georgetown jerseys . That 's how fanatical he was . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he advised Mourning to walk away , too . Even after Mourning listened and obeyed , everyone still wrongly assumed he was one of Edmond 's crew , a tainted soul or something . But he could n't shut them up , not when he was called as a witness by the defense the next November in Edmond 's court trial , the trial that sent Edmond to prison for life without parole . And so the scowl stayed , the same scowl Patrick Ewing wore . <p> He felt judged . And by the time he reached the Charlotte Hornets , he still had the same anxieties Fannie Threet had tried to smooth-talk him out of . He was ornery and particularly bitter that he had been the second pick in the 1992 draft , a consolation prize behind Shaquille O'Neal . He yelled nasty words one day at a female reporter , fought the Bulls ' Luc Longley and fumed at referees . <p> " I used to lead the league in techs , " he says . " I just had this huge chip on my shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage I was going through . I remember I was on the bench injured and still got ejected . I look back , and I 'm like , ' Did I do that ? ' " <p> Mourning was traded to the Heat on the eve of the 1995-96 season after a contract dispute , so the chip became Riley 's problem . But if Fannie Threet could n't fix it , nobody could . The Bulls and Dennis Rodman baited him during his first playoff series with the Heat , and he was a blundering fool , tossing elbows and forcing shots . <p> " They got in my head , " he says . " I 'd pounded myself so much that I just broke down and cried after that series . In Pat Riley 's office . Right in front of him . I just let it out , man . It was like I tried to do everything in my power for us to win , and I just broke down . " <p> But nobody knew those were the teenage years coming out . They did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time <p> and money to foster and group homes in Miami . They did n't know the reason he pranced around in designer suits was because he had n't had any clothes that fit in high school . They did n't know he spent the offseasons tirelessly working on his jump shot , his hook and his baseline drive . They did n't know that he had met his future wife at a high school tournament in her hometown of Las Vegas or that he had written her love letters for the entire summer . Or that she wrote back to say , " I 'm going to Howard in the fall . Where are you going ? " Or that the moment he got to Georgetown , he called every dorm at Howard because he had to find her , just had to . <p> No , all they saw was that maddening face . Squeaky-clean Grant Hill dunked on him once and actually stood over him , glaring . <p> " I jumped up and kind of went back at him , " Mourning says . " But Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're not gon na fight Grant Hill , are you ? Come on , man . Not Grant Hill . ' That crap was funny . " <p> Later , in the 1997 Eastern Conference semifinals , he made a three-pointer to eliminate the Knicks at Madison Square Garden and flexed his biceps . The camera caught him shouting an obscenity . This was the same Alonzo Mourning who had just donated $ 50,000 worth of suits to a tall man whose house burned down , but no one in New York City knew . All they knew was that they had just seen another profane Mourning display . <p> " He let that one rip , " one league official said . " You could hear him deep into the crowd . I thought , ' This is n't good . A lot of kids are around . ' " <p> Then came the fight , the defining 1998 fight against Johnson . He might have made $ 105 million , but on the most important day of the season  --  the fifth game of a five-game series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no chance . It was the longest summer of his life . But it was cathartic , and it was the beginning of the end of a temper . <p> Most of all , he had realized that summer that he had a family to lean on . He and Tracy had just been married in the Caribbean , with 80-year-old Fannie Threet joined in the audience by his real parents . And he had a son of his own , Alonzo III , born in 1997 , who looked just like him and said things like , " You 're the best daddy in the world . " <p> When Mourning returned the next season , the lockout season , he called referees by their first names and played so well he was runner-up in the MVP voting . At 6-10 and 260 pounds , he 's more of a power forward , but he scored 20 points per game and was voted defensive player of the year . <p> " Imagine if I was 7-1 , " he says . " I 'd be the best player in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delightful sequel . Mourning leads the league in blocked shots , scores more than 22 points per game and carries a team full of sore knees . Teammate P.J. Brown says , " I thought last year he was MVP , but he 's even more phenomenal this year . " <p> So the fight , the marriage , the son  --  all of it  --  conspired to make him Fannie Threet 's Al again . <p> " He 's back to his true self , " Lassiter says . " The real him is back . For a long time , he was trying to build something that was false , trying to prove himself . It took him longer that I thought , but he 's himself now . He does n't have nothing to prove now . " <p> Of course , he stills live in a wicked world , his critics still say he disappears in the fourth quarter and some teammates are convinced that he and Riley are so tight that he can get any of them traded . <p> " What the hell ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team . Of course , Riley is going to come and ask me questions about what 's going on with the team . But there 's also more pressure on me , more than they 'll ever know . <p> " All I care about is winning . Listen , man , I do n't drink at all during the season . At all . Nothing . I do n't have beers with my dinner . But I make that sacrifice so I can stay healthy , so I can deal with Riley 's long-ass practices . " <p> So , no , he does n't drink . But he drives , loves to drive . He always has favored fast cars , and that 's why he adored his Porsche . And that 's why he ordered the Aston Martin seven months ago . And he rushed to pick it up that night because he was n't ready to put away all of his childish things . <p> But he did put it away on the day the linebacker died . His wife cried and told one woman all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bobby Phills . <p> And on All-Star Weekend last month , Al got a tap on the shoulder , a small , unobtrusive tap . It was Mrs. Bobby Phills . All she said was , " Thank you . " <p> Reprinted with permission from ESPN The Magazine .
