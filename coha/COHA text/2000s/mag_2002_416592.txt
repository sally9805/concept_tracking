Section : Fitness <p> We can view exercise as a hobby . <p> For the men of the Marine Corps , it 's a matter of life and death . <p> So quit whining and embrace the hard-Corps work habits of the few and the proud <p> " Nobody ever drowned in sweat . " <p> The Marines like to say that . And why not ? It perfectly describes the training philosophy of the 227-year-old Corps , an organization that prides itself on being lean , mean , and ready to do the country 's business . Within hours of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon last September , Marines around the world were put on full alert , and the reserves were called up . The 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit , an at-sea force of more than 2,500 Marines , was one of the first to be thrust into combat in the mountains of Afghanistan . It was a hard time , and they were the hard guys who answered the call . They left the rest of us wondering , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so nobody 's going to ask you to take Kandahar airport . But we 're thinking , a little military preparedness would n't hurt any of us , would it ? To find out how the Marines do it , we went to Camp Lejeune , North Carolina , home of the II Marine Expeditionary Force , looking for inspiration and motivation . We picked five Marines to serve as your personal drill instructors . Whether they 're blasting away Taliban or training to do so , they get the job done . For Marines , the only way out ... is through . <p> So stand up , buckle up , and shuffle to the door . Jump right into your workout and shout , " Marine Corps ! " And no whining , either . Whatsa matter , puke , your mama not love you enough ? Staff Sgt. David Rodriguez , 31 <p> Specialty : Section leader , 81 mm Mortar Platoon <p> Unit : 2nd Battalion , 25th Marine Regiment , USMC Reserves , Garden City , NY <p> DAVID RODRIGUEZ GOT HIS FIRST exposure to warrior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand-flea  --  infested peninsula where they 've made Marines for 87 years . After enduring 12-mile forced marches , machine-gun runs , and bayonet assault courses , he graduated from basic training , then became a " grunt "  --  Marine-speak for a rifle-toting infantryman . Less than 3 years later , Rodriguez was knee-deep in the Kuwait desert , shooting up Saddam Hussein 's Republican Guard . In our current struggles , he figures he 's ready for whatever comes . <p> " That 's when you really appreciate your dedication to physical training and fitness , " he says . " The endurance you need to carry no pounds of gear on your back 10 miles to an extraction point is incredible . And you ca n't get in shape after the shooting starts . " <p> Endurance and speed are crucial to Marines like Rodriguez , who weighs just 165 pounds . " Infantrymen do a lot of running , so excess muscle in the legs will slow us down , " he says . " Ground-pounders like me need upper-body strength . " <p> Rodriguez works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1-day-off routine . He averages about 90 minutes per gym visit and tops off every workout with 20 to 40 minutes on a stairclimber , treadmill , or both . His total-body workout does n't stop there . He 's continually working on what the Marines call their " brain housing group . " His mantra : Train the mind and then push your body . STAFF SGT . RODRIGUEZ 'S TRICEPS WORKOUT <p> Rodriguez must keep his upper body in fighting shape . His life and job may depend on it . ( He hefts 94-pound , 81 mm mortar systems around the battlefield . ) That 's why he pays special attention to his arms . Here 's his triceps routine : LYING CABLE TRICEPS EXTENSION <p> Three or four sets , 10 reps Position a bench inside a cable station so that one end of the bench is about a foot in front of the low pulley . Attach a straight bar to the pulley and lie on the bench with your head toward the pulley . Grab the bar with an overhand grip and hold it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar without moving your upper arms , until your forearms are just parallel to the floor . Pause , then return the bar to the starting position by straightening your arms . TRICEPS PUSHDOWN V bar : Two or three sets , eight to 10reps Straight bar : Two or three sets , eight to 10 reps <p> Attach a V bar or straight bar to the high pulley of a cable station . Grab the bar with an overhand grip and pull it down until your elbows are bent 90 degrees . Hold your upper arms against your sides and , without moving them , push the bar down until your arms are completely straight . The only body parts that should move are your forearms . Pause , then slowly allow the bar to rise until your elbows are once again bent 90 degrees . <p> * Staff Sgt. Rodriguez 's Best Tip : " Mental discipline is just as important as physical discipline , " he says . " When you 're out there alone , on foot in the desert , you 've got to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 've also got to have the motivation to push on through any hardship . " Sgt. Bryan Harmon , 24 <p> Specialty : Weapons instructor <p> Unit : Weapons Training Battalion , Camp Lejeune , NC <p> ON THE CAMP LEJEUNE rifle ranges where Harmon is most at home , only lightning can halt the target practice . " We still run the ranges in the rain . The shooters just have to adjust , " he says . " When they complain , we remind them , ' It wo n't stop raining in combat . ' " <p> Harmon 's fitness regimen is equally unbending . The sign taped to the ceiling above his rack reads : " WAKE UP YOU LAZY PIECE OF SH  --  AND GO TO THE GYM . " <p> " It started when I was stationed in Japan , " he says . " There was n't much to do , so I started hitting the weights . I got serious pretty quickly . " His once-scrawny body has morphed into a 195-pound powerhouse capable of benching nearly twice his body weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about an hour and a half per session . His routine is intensive , and the weights heavy . " I say go big or go home , " he says . He 's tried combination routines over the years , but says that working a single muscle group each day helps him get bigger faster . <p> " I live on the beach , so when I take off my shirt , I want to look as good as I feel , " he says . " It 's a great self-confidence booster . You see it , and achieve it . It 's awesome . " SGT . HARMON 'S " GET BIG " WEEKLY WORKOUT <p> Monday : Biceps Single-arm curls , cable curls , standing barbell curls , incline dumbbell curls <p> Tuesday : Chest Lifting on the flat bench , dumbbell decline and incline ( for mass ) , Hammer Strength wide grips and standing cable crossovers ( for cut ) <p> Wednesday : Legs Squats , leg presses , lunges , leg extensions , leg curls <p> Thursday : Triceps Dips , cable pressdowns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope cable pulldowns <p> Friday : Back Wide-grip chinups , lat pulldowns behind the back , bent-over barbell rows , T-bar rows <p> Saturday : Shoulders Arnold presses , military presses , standing lateral raises , front dumbbell raises , dumbbell shrugs <p> * Sgt. Harmon 's Best Tip : Stay motivated . " Whether at work or in the gym , motivation and discipline are the keys to success , " he says . Sgt. Grafton T. Wiley , 22 <p> Specialty : Radio operator <p> Unit : Marine Air Control Squadron 2 , Cherry Point , NC <p> AS THE CADENCE GOES , Wiley 's " up in the morning with the rising sun " and he " runs all day till the running 's done . " Last fall and winter , just after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , Wiley was told he was headed to war . He went home , packed his trusty sea bag , and shipped out just days later . His daily run then took place on the flight deck of the amphibious assault ship Bataan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's pretty motivating to run out there on deck , surrounded by jets and helicopters , just as the sun is breaking the horizon " he says . " It 's kind of picture perfect . " <p> That solitude was broken when the Marines were ordered to storm ashore . Wiley 's mission : Establish secure ground-communication networks once the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit took down the Kandahar Airport in southeastern Afghanistan . " I was proud to play a part , " he says . <p> Wiley was too busy fighting a war to work out while in Kandahar , but he did spy some hardcore colleagues filling milk jugs with cement to fashion " field-expedient " barbell sets . He says his predeployment fitness routine was what really helped when the balloon went up . " There was n't any real fear going though my mind " he says . " I felt strong , confident , and ready . That 's a good feeling . " <p> Wiley 's been a rabbit all his life  --  he ran cross-country and track in high school and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't until he joined the Corps in 1998 that he began lifting weights . " I always had good definition in my body , but never much size , " he says . " Now people look at me and say , ' You look like you stay in the gym all day ' That makes me want to get in there even more " SGT . WILEY 'S ARMS BUILDUP <p> Wiley sticks to his guns , and we 're not just talking the government-issue type . His 18 1/2-inch biceps gave him bragging rights on the Bataan . His favorite biceps exercise : the hammer curl . Do it the Wiley way : <p> Grab a pair of dumbbells and stand with your feet hip-width apart . Let your arms hang straight down from your shoulders and turn your palms so they 're facing each other . Without moving your upper arms , curl the weights up as high as you possibly can . Pause briefly , then slowly lower the weights back to the starting position . <p> Wiley does four sets of eight repetitions , increasing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then go to 65 , then try to do 70 for the last two sets , " he says . " If I start bending or wiggling , I just drop the amount of weight back down . " Start with a weight that 's 75 percent of what you can lift eight times , increase to 85 percent , then use 95 to 100 percent for your last two sets . <p> * Sgt. Wiley 's Best Tip : Do n't rush the exercise . " Try to squeeze everything you can out of each rep you do . If you go slow , it can really make a difference . " He also advocates an occasional soul-searing war cry . Sgt. Michael Johnson , 22 <p> Specialty : Hydraulic pneumatic mechanic <p> Unit : Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron 29 , Marine Corps Air Station , New River , NC <p> MIKE JOHNSON DID N'T WANT TO REPORT to Marine Corps boot camp as a 150-pound weakling . A recent high-school graduate , Johnson knew that basketball alone would n't prepare him for 13 weeks of nonstop recruit training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 'd better be strong enough to handle it . So , in the months before shipping out , he started hitting the weight room to add bulk to his body . He quickly fell for his new fitness routine and career choice . " I started taking weights very seriously , " Johnson says . " I put on size , and I got hooked . " <p> Serving 6 months at sea during a routine " Med cruise "  --  deployment to the Mediterranean Sea  --  helped focus Johnson 's newfound passion . " That 's where I saw the most growth , during that 6-month spurt , " says Johnson , who now Weighs 200 pounds . " I just ate very well and worked out every night  --  sometimes 4 hours a night . " <p> Johnson has cut back a little  --  he now works out 5 days a week , about 2 hours each session . His days on the basketball court are over , he says , thanks to multiple injuries . " The weight room is where you can find me now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his 27-inch quads , though he still wants to pack 4 more inches of muscle onto the area . He uses a combination of biking , front squats , leg extensions , and leg presses to build his quads . <p> Johnson 's metabolism is so fast that he " could pretty much eat anything , " he says . Still , he tries to maintain a 6,000-calorie daily diet  --  about the same as cyclists consume during the Tour de France . Johnson eats lots of tuna fish , rice , pasta , fresh fruit , and cottage cheese . He also downs plenty of water to stay hydrated during those long hours in the gym . SGT . JOHNSON 'S LEG ROUTINE <p> To keep his legs as ripped as the rest of his body , Johnson bikes for 20 minutes before every workout . On Wednesdays , he specifically targets his quadriceps for 1 hour 's worth of attention . His favorite exercise : leg extensions ( though he also uses leg presses and front squats to round out the workout ) . Here 's a move that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg-extension machine so your back is flat against the vertical pad and your shins are against the leg pads . Your hips , knees , and ankles should all be bent 90 degrees . Raise the weight by extending your legs until they 're : : almost straight . Pause , then slowly lower the weight to the starting position . <p> * Sgt. Johnson 's Best Tip : Crank up the volume . " Buy a pair of quality headphones and get amped , " he says . " You can lose yourself in the music and let it drive you even harder . " Our favorite selection : Van Halen 's " Panama . " Sgt. Sean Mickle , 27 <p> Specialty : Reconnaissance <p> Unit : II Force Reconnaissance , Camp Lejeune , NC <p> SEAN MICKLE IS a real-life Rambo . As a member of II Force Reconnaissance  --  the Marine Corps equivalent of the Army Special Forces or the Navy SEALs  --  Mickle must constantly be cocked , locked , and ready to rock . Recon Marines prowl behind enemy lines for days at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clandestine eyes and ears of their commander  --  and , occasionally , of the commander-in-chief . " We do ' direct action ' missions as required , " Mickle explains . Translation : Yes sir , Mr. President . We 'll delouse those caves for you . <p> That 's one reason Mickle has learned the value of what he and his mates call " expeditionary fitness " Work hard in the gym when you can , improvise when you ca n't . " I 'm always getting pulled out of my workout routine , " he says . " I might have to go a month without lifting because of a mission . But you just ca n't stop training . Adapt . " <p> Mickle has an affection for pushups and big rocks . " You can curl rocks to work your biceps , do flutter kicks for your abs , and do diamond pushups to work the chest , " he says . SGT . MICKLE 'S PYRAMID APPROACH <p> Mickle employs a " pyramid " approach to his 1-hour weight-lifting routines . No matter which body part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each , with 10 , eight , six , and four repetitions . He rests no more than 1 minute between sets and after each group of four sets . With each set , he increases the weight by 10 pounds . So a straight-bar biceps set could start with 10 repetitions with a 45-pound bar loaded with 25 pounds on each side ( total weight : 95 pounds ) and end with four reps of 125 pounds . By the last set in each round , he 's lifting the maximum weight he can lift for four repetitions . After all that , he does a " burnout set " of 10 repetitions with the lightest weight , " just to keep the blood flowing . " Mickle says the pyramid routine , followed by a burnout set , helps build bulk as well as endurance . <p> * Sgt. Mickle 's Best Tip : " When I 'm sitting in the woods and have no weights to lift , I look for a boulder or a log . I let my imagination run . " THE MARINE CORP 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MONTEZUMA TO your own home gym , here 's a hard-Corps fitness routine designed for men on the go . <p> The Marines love their reputation as the " first to fight . " But when they deploy to the sands of Iwo Jima or the mountains of Afghanistan , it 's unlikely a gym will be handy .
