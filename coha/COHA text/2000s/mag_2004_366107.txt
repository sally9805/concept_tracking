For many men in a particular age range  --  and , disturbingly , some well beyond it  --  Natalie Portman is a dream celebrity . Some of the reasons for this are not entirely healthy . At 23 , she still has a lot of little girl in her looks , and she projects an innocence mixed with spontaneity and quiet loneliness that makes men believe she 'll want to learn from them . <P> But Portman is also incredibly smart ( at Harvard , law professor Alan Dershowitz gave her his highest grade in two classes ) . She 's elegant , unpretentious , unguarded and kind . She 's an ethical vegetarian who has used her star status to talk to John McCain and Hillary Clinton about micro-financing for women in developing countries . So the men whose idealization is a little creepy have a lot to hide behind . Clive Owen , who plays opposite Portman 's stripper character in Closer , seems to have the excuse down : " We had a scene , which is probably the longest in the movie , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it with her . She was so smart and intelligent , and I thought she nailed it . " Portman is the sort of fantasy you can bring home to your mother . <P> The Closer role appealed to Portman because she wanted to work with Mike Nichols , who directed her in a stage production of The Seagull in New York City in August 2001 . For a few years , they searched for a project , briefly considering a movie about Andy Warhol star Edie Sedgwick before settling on Patrick Marber 's play . Portman had avoided sexually charged roles ever since she played , in close succession , the street urchin in The Professional and the 13-year-old who flirts with Timothy Hutton in Beautiful Girls . " I had a bad early experience when The Professional came out . I 'm really proud of the film , but it was strange for me to be looked at as a sexual object when I was 12 , " she says . So she did such movies as Mars Attacks , Star Wars , Cold Mountain and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woody Allen film ( Everyone Says I Love You ) . But she felt she was ready to entrust Nichols with presenting a more sexual character in Closer . " I wanted to be able to form my own sexual identity . If other people have you in their mind as some sort of sex object , you have two choices : either to live up to it and become super-sexual or rebel against it and be super-asexual . " <P> But a film about betrayal was a tough way to get back in the game . " I 'm the anti-Method actor . As soon as we finish a scene , I need to go back to being myself , because it freaks me out . But it was hard not to take this home with me , " she says . " I would feel cheated on when I went home . There were weekend nights I would lie in bed instead of going out with my friends . " <P> In a world in which e-mail and cell phones filter so much human interaction , Portman believes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone has been on one or more of the sides of the stories in Closer , " she says . <P> And even though playing a pole dancer seems like a stretch , Portman does n't see this character as being that radical a shift from her past roles . " I was the precocious one when I was younger , and now I 'm the girlish one , " she says . " Which ultimately means I 've stayed the same . Which is not a good sign . " Though it 's precisely what makes all those men worship her . By Joel Stein
