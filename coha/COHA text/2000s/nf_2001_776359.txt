The Road to Good Counsel Hill // They will open up to you , but only if you give of yourself first . //  --  Sister Carmen Burg // On a spring morning in 1986 , when the midwestern snowpack finally had begun to melt and the change of seasons encouraged new ideas to sprout , I sat nervously in the reception room of a convent in St. Paul , Minnesota , with a new idea of my own . I had come here to meet Sister Carmen Burg , who would either help my idea take root or wish me luck and send me on my way . I feared that she had bad news for me. // As an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Minnesota , I was struggling mightily to find my niche . In the competitive world of scientific research , especially at a large institution , I knew I had little time to establish my value to the department . All too frequently I remembered my chairman 's words : " It 's nice to be independent , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected leader of one of Minnesota 's largest groups of Catholic nuns , the School Sisters of Notre Dame . Nearly two hundred sisters lived at the Good Counsel Hill convent in Mankato , ninety miles southwest of St. Paul . I had contacted Sister Carmen to propose a research project involving the nuns . Now I worried that she had offered to meet me here  --  before I ever got to Mankato  --  so that it would be less awkward to turn me down . Underscoring my anxiety were images that had been seared into my memory at Sacred Heart elementary school . Most of the sisters had been serious , take-no-prisoners disciplinarians. // I had learned what I knew about the School Sisters of Notre Dame from Nora Keenan , a graduate student in our department . Nora had an unusual background for an epidemiologist : She had previously been one of the Notre Dames and had lived at the Mankato convent . She explained to me that her former congregation had originated in Bavaria in 1833 , at a time of great political and social upheaval . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerhardinger , who later took the religious name Mary Teresa of Jesus . Mother Teresa , as she was known , believed that society could be transformed through the family , and that her call was to provide education and spiritual formation for girls  --  particularly poor girls in rural areas . Shortly after the congregation was established , millions of Germans  --  driven by crop failure and revolution  --  began to emigrate to the United States , and the American bishops asked Mother Teresa to consider a new frontier for her mission . Together with four other sisters , she arrived at a forest settlement in Pennsylvania in 1847 . From there , the congregation had moved west and south with the immigrants , founding schools and convents throughout North America . By 1986 , the congregation ( now based in Rome ) had more than seven thousand sisters in nearly thirty countries . The Mankato convent  --  one of seven provincial motherhouses in this country  --  had been established in 1912. // Nora 's account immediately sparked my interest . As I told her one day over lunch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populations of religious groups . For my Ph.D . thesis at Minnesota , I had joined an ongoing study of the Lutheran Brotherhood and investigated whether cancer and heart disease had any links to alcohol use . I then worked at California 's Loma Linda Medical College , investigating the impact of diet on the health of Seventh-day Adventists . Now that I was back at Minnesota , I wanted to study aging and health , and I suspected that nuns or priests  --  I did not really have a preference  --  would offer unique clues . It was then that Nora had offered an introduction to Sister Carmen . // My nervous wait ended when a short , smiling woman came into the reception room and held out her hand . Sister Carmen was dressed in a simple white blouse , camel-colored cardigan , and long plaid skirt . Only a small pin over her heart signaled her membership in the School Sisters of Notre Dame . I had forgotten that since my days at Sacred Heart school , the reforms of the Second Vatican Council ( or Vatican II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her early sixties , Sister Carmen wore large glasses , and behind them I could see the intelligent , patient eyes of a woman who had taught thousands of children . After we had chatted for a few minutes , she got right to the point . // " You know , Dr. Snowdon , " she said in her distinct midwestern accent , " I love being a nun . Sisters are as human as the next person . But my question is , why on earth do you want to study nuns ? " // She listened attentively as I described my past work with Lutherans and Adventists . I explained to Sister Carmen that these religious groups kept extensive membership lists and historical records that made them ideal subjects for epidemiological studies . And the members often had similar lifestyles , which enabled researchers to make powerful comparisons of factors connected to illness or health . Nuns had even more similar histories . They do not smoke . They are celibate . They have similar jobs and income , and they receive similar health care for most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confounding variables  --  such as poverty and lack of health care  --  that can cloud the meaning of data . Outside a laboratory , it would be hard to find as pure an environment for research . // In fact , I went on , nuns had already played a crucial role in expanding our understanding of two devastating diseases that afflict women : breast cancer and cervical cancer . In the 1950s scientists observed that nuns had an unusually high risk for breast cancer . This led researchers to examine overall breast cancer rates more closely , comparing single to married women . It emerged that single women , like nuns , also had a high risk of breast cancer . The variable turned out to be pregnancy and the hormonal changes it causes . Much of today 's understanding of how hormones affect breast health had its origin in this research . // Several famous studies , on the other hand , have reported cervical cancer to be rare in nuns and common in prostitutes , I offered , immediately realizing how odd this must have sounded to Sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmitted virus that ultimately emerged as the link to cancer . " Again , it is n't difficult to make the connection , " I added . // " No , it is n't , " she agreed . // I gladly changed the subject to aging and the purpose of my visit . " I 'm hoping the study of the School Sisters of Notre Dame will lead to some major clues about aging and disease , " I said . " Ultimately , I want to increase our knowledge and help people live longer , better lives . " // Sister Carmen brightened when she heard this . If she was bothered by the vagueness  --  or vastness  --  of what I was proposing , she did n't let on . She sat quietly for a minute . // " Let me tell you , Dr. Snowdon , " she began . " We have always believed in the power of knowledge and ideas . A large part of our mission has always been teaching . Over ninety percent of our sisters have been teachers at one time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no schools before they arrived . // " Our sisters have spent their entire adult lives trying to help other people in the community . Even in their retirement , they have a deep passion and drive to help others . I think they would see your study as a way to continue their lifelong mission of helping others , of educating others . " // " Yes , I hope so , " I said . // Sister Carmen paused again and then let out a big , contented sigh . " Okay , " she said , as only a Minnesotan can . // " Okay ? " I was confused . " You mean  --  " // " Wait . " She raised her open hand and stopped me in midsentence . " I 'll move forward with your request , but you need to listen carefully to what I am about to say . No matter what you do , I want you to remember who these women are . They are real people . Very dear to us . They are holy people , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects . Get to know them . Understand that many of the older sisters were the teachers or mentors of the younger sisters , and we treat them with the care and respect they deserve . We will expect nothing less from you . " // I was a little stunned by Sister Carmen 's statement . My prior research projects had included tens of thousands of participants , and I knew them only through their medical records and the questionnaires they had filled out . All researchers are taught that scientific objectivity depends on keeping one 's distance from the people one studies . I had no idea how I could fulfill her request , so I simply nodded and said , " I 'll do my best . " // Sister Carmen gave me this parting advice : " They will open up to you , " she said , " but only if you give of yourself first . " // If Sister Carmen had asked me how I became an epidemiologist , I would have had to answer , " Chickens . " // Puberty took away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gymnast , so I needed something new to do after school . Unlike my two older brothers , I had little interest in football or baseball . Being a teen also meant that I badly wanted to be different from my brothers  --  and everyone else . So I decided to take up a hobby my father had pursued when he was a child : raising chickens and selling their eggs . With his help , I built a couple of coops in our suburban backyard and bought some multicolored bantam chickens at a local farm . // Bantams are the most petite breed of poultry , and they only occasionally lay eggs , which also are quite small . When I realized that these miniature chickens would produce only miniature profits , I began to do my homework . I became a student of chickens . // I read every book in the library about chickens , requested every pamphlet on chicken farming available from the United States Department of Agriculture , and wrote every hatchery in the state asking for information on their chicks . I finally decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both because they had excellent egg production and because they had enough meat on their bones to make a decent meal . I bought a trio of Reds , two hens and a rooster , from a noted breeder in Illinois , who shipped them by train to my home in California . // My chicken hobby became my passion . Business began to boom , and I made more money on my egg route than my friends made on their newspaper routes . I became " David the Eggman , " a nickname that riffed off Beatles lyrics and made me proud . // My flock grew to nearly a hundred Rhode Island Reds , and I monitored my population closely . I weighed each bird weekly and charted individual egg production . I vaccinated every chick . Any bird that fell ill went into isolation so as not to infect others . I installed the best watering system I could afford , fed them high-quality feed , kept refining their housing conditions , and when necessary treated them with antibiotics . It was pure economics : The longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive , the more money I could make . I began systematically studying ways to maintain my flock 's health and well-being , which led to several blue-ribbon birds that I showed at the San Bernardino County Fair . // Although I did not know it at the time , my chickens taught me the fundamentals of epidemiology . Understanding the causes of a disease in a population can lead to prevention strategies  --  and it 's far more effective to prevent disease than to treat it after it has occurred . To study the factors that cause disease , we need to compare individuals in a population , from the direly ill to the remarkably healthy as well as the ones in between . Disease is a process , and the conditions of early life  --  whether chosen or imposed  --  often cause or prevent later problems . // Finally , my flock also introduced me to a central focus of gerontology : the importance of maintaining function and of understanding the key points along a continuum , from highly productive to completely disabled . For my chickens , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they continue to lay eggs ? Successful aging in a human being is more complicated , as maintaining both physical and mental function requires an intricate interplay of myriad factors . Nonetheless , the basic principles are similar to those I learned in my own backyard . // I 've always enjoyed the two-hour drive down U.S. 169 from the Twin Cities to Mankato . I made the trip for the first time two weeks after my meeting with Sister Carmen Burg . The road keeps company with the Minnesota River much of the way and runs through rolling fields of soybeans and corn . Elm trees shade the white farmhouses , and silos sit next to red barns  --  the kind of comfortable midwestern landscape that might appear in a child 's picture book . It was a six-day trek in 1852 , the year Mankato was named with the Sioux word for " blue earth . " The bluish-tinted clay soil is still visible along the roadside as you approach the town . The French explorer Pierre LeSueur was so sure it contained copper that he shipped two tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be given the disappointing news that it was worthless . // Good Counsel Hill  --  or the Hill , as it is known in these parts  --  is in the northern section of town . As the road winds upward past the high school track and soccer field , the spire of the convent 's chapel jumps into view . The aqua-colored water tower confirms that you are in the right place : Good Counsel , it says in bold block letters . // Past a garden planted with azaleas , roses , and wildflowers , the convent 's main entrance is guarded by two marble angels . I still miss the presence of Sister Timona , who was the unofficial night sentry during my early visits . Sister Timona maintained her post in full black-and-white habit , resting from time to time in one of the wheelchairs kept by the door . This was her only concession to her eighty-nine years of age . She would call out cheerfully to the nurses at shift change , and she soon greeted me just as warmly . // The convent is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hallways can sometimes feel like a maze . But the feeling of orderliness and calm is palpable the minute you enter . To the left of the main entrance is the community room , lit by high windows and furnished with comfortable sofas and rockers . Brass lamps and green plants sit on the side tables , along with copies of Catholic Digest and Time and glass jars of peppermints. // There 's a large dining table at one end of the room , and next to it is a smaller table where a few sisters  --  the " night owls "  --  sometimes play cards late in the evening , which means eight-thirty or nine , except for Fridays , when the sisters stay up a little later for popcorn and pop . The sisters are big on games . Competition is stiff on everything from dominoes to Triple Yahtzee , bridge to Scrabble , Boggle to cribbage , and a dice game called Fill or Bust . I learned quickly that I 'd have to pay full attention if I wanted to keep up with the play  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
