Artist Peter Waddell 's Scrupulously Researched Paintings Of The U.S. Capitol Bring History To Life <p> " When people think of the U.S. capitol , " says Peter Waddell , " it 's usually as a backdrop for some trench-coated newsman reporting live from its steps . " Not Waddell ; the New Zealand native has been in thrall with the building since his first visit to Washington , D.C. in 1991 . " It was the middle of the winter , " he says , " and everything was quiet and hushed . The stone , the marble , the sky  --  they were all silvery gray and bathed in this kind of strange , pearly light . " <p> Since moving to Washington in 1995 , Waddell , a 47-year-old artist specializing in historical subjects , has spent two and a half years creating 20 carefully researched paintings that vividly reconstruct the Capitol 's interiors as they appeared from about 1812 to 1875 . These works are now on view at the American Architectural Foundation 's Octagon Museum in Washington ( through October 15 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cultural life in the city in the 19th century , " says Waddell . " My interest was not in political subjects but in the lives of the people who built and visited the Capitol . " <p> Author and historian David McCullough shares the artist 's view of the Capitol 's significance . " It 's our most important building , " he says . " It 's our castle , it 's our shrine , and Waddell has snapped it to life . Maybe only someone born elsewhere , with a different perspective , could remind us how wonderful it is . " <p> McCullough believes that Waddell 's somewhat fanciful renderings are more historically accurate even than photographs from the period . " There 's a tendency to think of the Victorian era as dour , gloomy and overbearing , with morbid darks and lights , " he says . " That 's primarily due to our familiarity with 19th-century portraits , where no one smiles and the subjects had to hold still because of the slow shutter speed . That was n't how people were then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shows them as colorful , rich and romantic  --  as a whole world unto itself . " <p> Waddell 's paintings invoke a time when men and women could wander freely through the Capitol 's halls , chambers and vestibules  --  rooms in which a good deal more than government and politics took place . ( Today visitors must be part of an official tour to see anything inside the Capitol and even then access is limited to a few major spaces such as the Rotunda . ) The main attraction , then as now , were Congressional sessions , but in the early days visitors could also attend religious services , join in celebrations of national holidays , witness demonstrations of the latest scientific innovations or simply marvel at the building 's grandeur . " I wanted to paint the rooms as they appeared when they were new , " says Waddell , " and to show what they meant to the people who used them at the time . " <p> Waddell , wrote Washington Times art critic Joanna Shaw-Eagle of the Octagon show , " has brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic buildings of Washington , " and Roll Call critic John McArdle called the exhibition " a stunning and nostalgic glimpse of the places and stories that existed inside the Capitol building . " The Spirit of Washington , 1842 , for instance , shows the Rotunda capped by architect Charles Bulfinch 's original wood-and-copper dome . Bonneted ladies wearing crinoline skirts waft through the grand atrium . Some of the women study the large historical paintings on the walls while others seem to avert their eyes from Horatio Greenough 's controversial statue of a partially clad George Washington . <p> " The painting records a very specific period , " says the Capitol 's architectural historian , William Allen , noting that Greenough 's sculpture , which depicted America 's founding father as a Greek god , remained inside the Capitol for only two years before being banished to the building 's east lawn . ( The statue now resides in the National Museum of American History . ) " It is the first color rendition of a room that has n't looked that way since 1855 , " adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based his paintings on written descriptions of the structure over the years , and on a handful of early prints , photographs and architectural plans . He gleaned most of the details for his depiction of the original dome and Rotunda from a sketch done in the 1830s by a New York architect . " Waddell takes the information , blows it up and completes it , " says Allen . <p> To help the artist portray the original Library of Congress while it was being built around 1821 in the Capitol 's center section just off the west portico , Allen referred Waddell to an old carpenter 's handbook that showed the ceiling 's wood-truss system ( destroyed by fire in 1851 ) . In the painting , amid laborers and engineers , scaffolding and brick , a winch hoists great sandstone pieces of the Corinthian columns  --  the Capitol 's only columns not fashioned entirely of single blocks of stone . " It may be a little detail , " says Allen , " but if he had shown it otherwise , it would n't have been right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. Henry Latrobe , an early Capitol architect , giving a private tour to Madame Betsy Patterson Bonaparte in 1812 . The notorious American beauty , who scandalized Washington society with her sheer , formfitting gowns , was then married to Napoleon 's youngest brother , Jerome . ( The marriage was later annulled by Napoleon . ) Waddell portrays another historic personage , Samuel F.B. Morse , in the building 's basement wiring up a telegraph demonstration for members of Congress . In the painting , Morse  --  also an accomplished artist-comes across an obviously neglected sculpture he had made 20 years earlier and presented to architect Charles Bulfinch . <p> In Walt Whitman 's Solace , 1865 , the poet emerges from the shadows of a doorway . Whitman helped minister to some of the more than 4,000 Union troops housed in the Capitol during the Civil War ( many were injured or ill ) and was initially troubled by the contrast between the ailing soldiers and the lavish decor  --  " poppy-show goddesses and all the pretty blue and gold , " he described it . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort to him . <p> " I think there is an element of shock when people see what the rooms looked like , " says Waddell . " They 're so decorated , gilded and ostentatious . It seems out of step with how Americans saw themselves . " Consider his rendition of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee Room as it looked circa 1856 . The Italian-born artist Constantino Brumidi painted the vividly colored murals  --  inspired by Pompeian frescoes  --  and American artist George R. West created naval scenes in lunettes above the doorways . But following a dispute about payment for the work , West 's paintings were obliterated . Waddell has re-created one of the scenes in his rendering of the room , whose ornateness , according to Barbara Wolanin , curator for the Architect of the Capitol , caused quite a stir when the room was first opened for use in 1858 . " All that elaborate painting , all those nymphs and cherubs , were considered outrageous at the time , " she says . In his painting , Waddell has also restored the room 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Minton tile floor . <p> " Peter has brought bits of information together and made them become a reality , " says Senate curator Diane Skvarla , who , along with Allen and Wolanin , assisted the artist in his research . " That 's what makes the works exciting . " Waddell even enlisted Skvarla to pose for one of his paintings . In The Bather , 1869 , she appears as a tourist who accidentally walks in on a senator emerging from a marble bathtub in the building 's basement . " It certainly made for a lot of conversation at the exhibition 's opening , " says Skvarla . When not in use , the tub , one of six made available to members of Congress whose living quarters lacked running water , was " always open to the inspection of visitors , " according to an 1860s newspaper account . <p> Waddell , who grew up in Hastings , a small town on New Zealand 's North Island , developed an early interest in history and architecture . " I used to like to climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " Everything was flat , except for the municipal theater , the public library and some banks with neoclassical facades . " He was encouraged to pursue a career in the arts by his mother , Penny , a librarian and law clerk , and by his father , Colin , who owned a cabinetmaking business . " I grew up seeing things made from start to finish , " he says . <p> Waddell studied fine art at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch . " The cutting edge had become very important in New Zealand , " he recalls . " Unless it was for the purpose of sledgehammer irony , it was very daring to portray a person in a painting . Narrative and historical subjects were essentially forbidden  --  and those were the things that fascinated me most . " As a young artist in Auckland , Waddell taught art at a local college and painted brightly colored figurative works using expressionistic brushwork . <p> It was n't until 1993 , when a collector in Boston commissioned him to do a painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in period dress into architectural settings . " I started to make historical costumes for my models to wear , " he says . " I always loved the photos of my great-grandmother in her bustles , hats and gloves . " <p> These days , Waddell is the artist-in-residence at Tudor Place Historic House and Garden in Washington , designed by original Capitol architect William Thornton for Martha Custis Peter ( granddaughter of Martha Washington ) and her husband . " It 's the perfect situation for me , " says Waddell . " The estate was home to six generations of a family that never threw anything out . Every object tells a story about the people who lived there . " <p> The Capitol has always been a place of low-down intrigue and ambition as well as lofty aspiration , but much of the appeal of Waddell 's paintings lies in his depiction of a lost innocence . The Marble Room  --  An Evening 's Work , 1871 captures that nicely . Based on a detail taken from a historical chronicle by Senator Robert Byrd , it shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Yet Waddell 's works , for all their charm , accommodate the view that history is not always picturesque . " One senator recently wanted to restore his office to its original appearance and was quite displeased when he found out that it had been an eight-seater privy , " says Waddell . " The past is not always how you imagined .
