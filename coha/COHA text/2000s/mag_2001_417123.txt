There are twelve creatures told of here ; Another 's hidden someplace near . Look at the letters that begin The names of those beasts found herein . What animal is then spelled out ? With beady eyes and hairy snout , He 's huge ! He weighs about four tons And shakes the ground each time he runs . THE HEDGEHOG The hedgehog is a funny beast . He does look like a hedge ! At least His coat is made of prickly spines Like dense and sharp and thorny vines . THE IBEX On mountain slopes , midst craggy peaks , The nimble ibex bounds and leaps . His horns curve back in splendor bold As if surprised at things untold . THE PUMA Behold the puma ! Blazing eye And lion 's coat , to give the lie To label cat . At night he prowls With crafty skill , no warning growls . What is this mysterious animal ? To find out , write down the first letters of the name of each of the twelve animals in the following poems . THE PANDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tops , he has his lair . This gentle creature lives on fruits // And buds and leaves and bamboo shoots . THE OKAPI In Africa , and only there , Is found the okapi , a rare And showy beast . Although he does n't Look it , to giraffes he 's cousin . THE PANGOLIN He has no teeth , he has no chin  --  The strange and funny pangolin . One of the oddest creatures known , He looks just like a big pine cone . THE OPOSSUM The possum lives in burrows deep . Here , in the day , he 'll soundly sleep . If taken by surprise , he 'll play He 's dead , in hopes you 'll go away . THE TIGER The tiger with his bold-striped coat And massive frame and pulsing throat Is truly wonderful to see ! But frightening , do n't you agree ? THE ALLIGATOR Along the river , now or later , Will float the sluggish alligator . // His grinning mouth can quickly trap Unwary fish . Great jaws go SNAP ! THE MONKEY The little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or scratch a bite . He climbs to the top of tallest trees And swings from branch to branch with ease . THE UNAU This two-toed sloth hangs upside down From boughs of trees . His coat 's gray-brown ; He has no tail . His eyes are bright And large , with sharpened nighttime sight . THE SKUNK If chased , the skunk wo n't run away . Instead , he turns his back to spray His enemies with awful scent ! If left alone , he 's quite content .
