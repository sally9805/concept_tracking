The weather is always inclement , the protagonists are all muddy when they 're not bloody , King Arthur 's Christianity is muscular but joyless , and Guinevere is often daubed with blue paint . No , folks , we 're not in Camelot anymore . Mostly we 're in and around Hadrian 's Wall in Britain at the dawn of the Dark Ages , with the Romans in retreat , the Saxons advancing and the severely downsized Knights of the Round Table defending civilization as they know it . Conditions in this world are not visibly much different from barbarism . Life on this frontier is rude and basic , though Guinevere ( Keira Knightley ) does tidy herself up and slip into something pretty before getting it on with Arthur ( Clive Owen ) . All poor Lancelot ( Ioan Gruffudd ) gets , however , is a wistful peek through the window at Guinevere in dishabille and early death on the battlefield . <P> A title card says this King Arthur , grimly directed by Antoine Fuqua ( Training Day ) , is based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But one ca n't help thinking the research that really counted was that into the more recent box-office charts . Hmm , look at those grosses for The Lord of the Rings . Must be some other old stuff we could turn into some sort of spectacle . So clang , clang , clang go the broadswords , swish , swish , swish go the flights of arrows , and twitch , twitch , twitch go our bottoms in the seats . There 's too much realism , not enough magic in historical romance these days . What these movies really need are cheeky athletes as their heroes , not actors lugubriously acting . They also need villains briskly spewing sardonic menace instead of grunting incomprehensibly . Above all , they need flash , sass and genial trash.  --  By Richard Schickel
