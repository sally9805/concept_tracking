I escape . I board Northwest 18 to New York , via Tokyo . The engine starts , there is no going back . Yesterday , I taught the last English class and left my job of thirty-two years . Five weeks earlier , A-Ma died of heartbreak , within days of my father 's sudden death . He was ninety-five , she ninety . Unlike A-Ba , who saw the world by crewing on tankers , neither my mother nor I ever left Hong Kong . <p> Their deaths rid me of responsibility at last , and I could forfeit my pension and that dreary existence . I am fifty-one and an only child , unmarried . <p> I never expected my parents to take so long to die . <p> This meal is luxurious , better than anything I imagined . <p> My colleagues who fly every summer complain of the indignities of travel . Cardboard food , cramped seats , long lines , and these days , too much security nonsense , they say . They fly Cathay , our " national " carrier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation ; " national " is n't our adjective . Semantics , they say , dismissive , just as they dismiss what I say of debt , that it is not an inevitable state , or that children exist to be taught , not spoilt . My colleagues live in overpriced , new , mortgaged flats and indulge ? to 2.5 children . Most of my students are uneducable . <p> Back , though , to this in-flight meal . Smoked salmon and cold shrimp , endive salad , strawberries and melon to clean the palate . Then , steak with mushrooms , potatoes au gratin , a choice between a shiraz or cabernet sauvignon . Three cheeses , white chocolate mousse , coffee and port or a liqueur or brandy . Foods from the pages of a novel , perhaps . <p> My parents ate sparingly , long after we were no longer impoverished , and disdained " unhealthy " Western diets . A-Ba often said that the only thing he really discovered from travel was that the world was hungry , and that there would never be enough food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not miss the travel when he retired . <p> I have no complaints of my travels so far . <p> My complaining colleagues do not fly business . This seat is an island of a bed , surrounded by air . I did not mean to fly in dignity , but having never traveled in summer , or at all , I did n't plan months ahead , long before flights filled up . I simply rang the airlines and booked Northwest , the first one that had a seat , only in business class . <p> Friends and former students , who do fly business when their companies foot the bill , were horrified . You paid full fare ? No one does ! I have money , I replied , why should n't I ? But you 've given up your " rice bowl . " Think of the future . <p> I hate rice , always have , even though I never left a single grain , because under my father 's watchful glare , A-Ma inspected my bowl . Every meal , even after her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square feet , over three times the size of home . I had wanted the Vanderbilt or Ambassador and would have settled for the Louis XV , but they were all booked , by those more important than I , no doubt . Anyway , this will have to do . " Nothing unimportant " happens here at the Plaza is what their website literature claims . <p> The porter arrives , and wheels my bags in on a trolley . <p> My father bought our tiny flat in a village in Shatin with his disability settlement . When he was fifty and I one , a falling crane crushed his left leg and groin , thus ending his sailing and procreating career . Shatin is n't very rural anymore , but our home has denied progress its due . We did n't get a phone till I was in my thirties . <p> I tip the porter five dollars and begin unpacking the leather luggage set . There is too much space for my things . <p> Right about now , you 're probably wondering , along with my colleagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does she think she 's doing ? It was what my parents shouted when I was twelve and went on my first hunger strike . <p> My parents were illiterate , both refugees from China 's rural poverty . A-Ma fried tofu at Shatin market . Once A-Ba recovered from his accident , he worked there also as a cleaner , cursing his fate . They expected me to support them as soon as possible , which should have been after six years of primary school , the only compulsory education required by law in the sixties . <p> As you see , I clearly had no choice but to strike , since my exam results proved I was smart enough for secondary school . My father beat me , threatened to starve me . How dare I , when others were genuinely hungry , unlike me , the only child of a tofu seller who always ate . Did I want him and A-Ma to die of hunger just to send me to school ? How dare I risk their longevity and old age ? <p> But I was unpacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumpkin 's territory , so rudely interrupted . <p> Veronica , whom I met years ago at university while taking a literature course , foisted this luggage on me . She runs her family 's garment enterprise , and is married to a banker . Between them and their three children , they own four flats , three cars , and at least a dozen sets of luggage . Veronica invites me out to dinner ( she always pays ) whenever she wants to complain about her family . Lately , we 've dined often . <p> " Kids , " she groaned over our rice porridge , two days before my trip . " My daughter wo n't use her brand-new Loewe set because , she says , that 's pass . All her friends at Stanford sling these canvas bags with one fat strap . Canvas , imagine . Not even leather . " <p> " Ergonomics , " I told her , annoyed at this bland and inexpensive meal . " It 's all about weight and balance . " And cost , I knew , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porridge because she 's overweight and no longer complains that I 'm thin . <p> She continued . " You 're welcome to take the set if you like . " <p> " Do n't worry yourself . I can use an old school bag . " <p> " But that 's barely a cabin bag ! Surely not enough to travel with . " <p> In the end , I let her nag me into taking this set which is more bag than clothing . <p> Veronica sounded worried when I left her that evening . " Are you sure you 'll be okay ? " <p> And would she worry , I wonder , if she could see me now , here , in this suite , this enormous space where one night 's bill would have taken my parents years , no , decades , to earn and even for me , four years ' pay , at least when I first started teaching in my rural enclave ( though you 're thinking , of course , quite correctly , Well , what about inflation , the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has spent her life instructing those who care not a whit for our " official language , " the one they never speak , at least not if they can choose , especially not now when there is , increasingly , a choice ) . <p> My unpacking is done ; the past need not intrude . I draw a bath , as one does in English Literature , to wash away the heat and grime of both cities in summer . Why New York ? Veronica asked , at the end of our last evening together . Because , I told her , it will be like nothing I 've ever known . For the first time since we 've known each other , Veronica actually seemed to envy me , although perhaps it was my imagination . <p> The phone rings , and it 's " Guest Relations " wishing to welcome me and offer hospitality . The hotel must wonder , since I grace no social register . I ask for a table at Lutce tonight . Afterwards , I tip the concierge ten dollars for successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am no longer an ignorant bumpkin , even though I never left the schools in the New Territories , our urban countryside , now that no one farms anymore . Besides , Hong Kong magazines detail lives of the rich and richer so I 've read of the famous restaurant and know about the greasy palms of New Yorkers . <p> I order tea and scones from Room Service . It will hold me till dinner at eight . <p> The first time I ever tasted tea and scones was at the home of my private student . To supplement income when I enrolled in Teacher Training , I tutored Form V students who needed to pass the School Certificate English exam . This was the compromise I agreed to with my parents before they would allow me to qualify as a teacher . Oh yes , there was a second hunger strike two years prior , before they would let me continue into Form IV . That time , I promised to keep working in the markets after school with AMa , which I did . <p> Actually , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I was hardly at a " name school " of the elite . An American priest taught at my secondary school , so I heard a native speaker . He was n't a very good teacher , but he paid attention to me because I was the only student who liked the subject . A little attention goes a long way . <p> Tea and scones ! I am supposed to be eating , not dwelling on the ancient past . The opulence of the tray Room Service brings far surpasses what that pretentious woman served , mother of the hopeless boy , my first private student of many , who only passed his English exam because he cheated ( he paid a friend to sit the exam for him ) , not that I 'd ever tell since he 's now a wealthy international businessman of some repute who can hire staff to communicate in English with the rest of the world , since he still can not , at least not with any credibility . That scone ( " from Cherikoff , " she bragged ) was cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scones , oozing with butter . To ooze . I like the lasciviousness of that word , with its excess of vowels , the way an excess of wealth allows people to waste kindness on me , as my former student still does , every lunar new year , by sending me a laisee packet with a generous check which I deposit in my parents ' bank account , the way I surrender all my earnings , as any filial and responsible unmarried child should , or so they said . <p> I eat two scones oozing with butter and savor tea enriched by cream and sugar , here at this " greatest hotel in the world , " to vanquish , once and for all , my parents ' fear of death and opulence . <p> Eight does not come soon enough . In the taxi on the way to Lutce , I ponder the question of pork . <p> When we were poor but not impoverished , A-Ma once dared to make pork for dinner . It was meant to be a treat , to give me a taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A-Ba became a vegetarian after his accident and prohibited meat at home ; eunuchs are angry people . She dared because he was not eating with us that night , a rare event in our family ( I think some sailors he used to know invited him out ) . <p> I shat a tapeworm the next morning-almost ten inches longand she never cooked pork again . <p> I have since tasted properly cooked pork , naturally , since it 's unavoidable in Chinese cuisine . In my twenties , I dined out with friends , despite my parents ' objections . But friends marry and scatter ; the truth is that there is no one but family in the end , so over time , I submitted to their way of being and seldom took meals away from home , meals my mother cooked virtually till the day she died . <p> I am distracted . The real question , of course , is whether or not I should order pork tonight . <p> I did not expect this trip to be fraught with pork ! <p> At Lutce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the next table are talking about me . Perhaps they pity me . People often pitied me my life . Starved of affection , they whispered , although why they felt the need to whisper what everyone could hear I failed to understand . All I desired was greater gastronomic variety , but my parents could n't bear the idea of my eating without them . I ate our plain diet and endured their perpetual skimping because they did eventually learn to leave me alone . That much filial propriety was reasonable payment . I just did n't expect them to stop complaining , to fear for what little fortune they had , because somewhere someone was less fortunate than they . That fear made them cling hard to life , forcing me to suffer their fortitude , their good health , and their longevity . <p> I should walk over to those overdressed people and tell them how things are , about famine , I mean , the way I tried to tell my students , the way my parents dinned it into me as long as they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waits as I take too long to study the menu . He does not seem patient , making him an oxymoron in his profession . My students would no more learn the oxymoron than they would learn about famine . Daughter , did you lecture your charges today about famine ? A-Ba would ask every night before dinner . Yes , I learned to lie , giving him the answer he needed . This waiter could take a lesson in patience from me . <p> Finally , I look up at this man who twitches , and do not order pork . Very good , he says , as if I should be graded for my literacy in menus . He returns shortly with a bottle of the most expensive red available , and now I know the people at the next table are staring . The minute he leaves , the taller of the two men from that table comes over . <p> " Excuse me , but I believe we met in March ? At the U.S. Consulate cocktail in Hong Kong ? You 're Kwai-sin Ho , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter Martin . " <p> Insulted , it 's my turn to stare at this total stranger . I look nothing like that simpering socialite who designs wildly fashionable hats that are all the rage in Asia . Hats ! We do n't have the weather for hats , especially not those things , which are good for neither warmth nor shelter from the sun . <p> Besides , what use are hats for the hungry ? <p> I do not accept his hand . " I 'm her twin sister , " I lie . " Kwai-sin and I are estranged . " <p> He looks like he 's about to protest , but retreats . After that , they do n't stare , although I am sure they discuss me now that I 've contributed new gossip for those who are nurtured by the crumbs of the rich and famous . But at least I can eat in peace . <p> It 's my outfit , probably . Kwai-sin Ho is famous for her cheongsams , which is all she ever wears , the way I do . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , I said the only thing I 'd ever wear when I grew up was the cheongsam , the shapely dress with side slits and a neck-strangling collar . She grimaced and said they were n't fashionable , that only spinster schoolteachers and prostitutes wore them , which , back in the sixties , was n't exactly true , but Kwai-sin was never too bright or imaginative . <p> That was long ago , before she became Kwai-sin in the cheongsam once these turned fashionable again , long before her father died and her mother became the mistress of a prominent businessman who whisked them into the stratosphere high above mine . For a little while , she remained my friend , but then we grew up , she married one of the shipping Hos , and became the socialite who refused , albeit politely , to recognize me the one time we bumped into each other at some function in Hong Kong . <p> So now , vengeance is mine . I will not entertain the people who fawn over her and possess no powers of recognition . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can not allow all these intrusions . I must get back to the food , which is , after all , the point of famine . <p> This is due to a lack of diligence , as A-Ma would say , this lazy meandering from what 's important , this succumbing to sloth . My mother was terrified of sloth , almost as much as she was terrified of my father . <p> She used to tell me an old legend about sloth . <p> There once was a man so lazy he would n't even lift food to his mouth . When he was young , his mother fed him , but as his mother aged , she could n't . So he marries a woman who will feed him as his mother did . For a time , life is bliss . <p> Then one day , his wife must return to her village to visit her dying mother . " How will I eat ? " he exclaims in fright . The wife conjures this plan . She bakes a gigantic cookie and hangs it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must do is bend forward and eat . " Wonderful ! " he says , and off she goes , promising to return . <p> On the first day , the man nibbles the edge of the cookie . Each day , he nibbles further . By the fourth day , he 's eaten so far down there 's no more cookie unless he turns it , which his wife expected he would since he could do this with his mouth . <p> However , the man 's so lazy he lies down instead and waits for his wife 's return . As the days pass , his stomach growls and begins to eat itself . Yet the man still wo n't turn the cookie . By the time his wife comes home , the lazy man has starved to death . <p> Memory causes such unaccountable digressions ! There I was in Lutce , noticing that people pitied me . Pity made my father livid , which he took out on A-Ma and me . Anger was his one escape from timidity . He wanted no sympathy for either his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me odd rather than pitiful . I will describe my appearance and let you judge . I am thin but not emaciated and have strong teeth . This latter feature is most unusual for a Hong Kong person of my generation . Many years ago , a dentist courted me . He taught me well about oral hygiene , trained as he had been at an American university . Unfortunately , he was slightly rotund , which offended A-Ba . I think A-Ma would n't have minded the marriage , but she always sided with my father , who believed it wise to marry one 's own physical type ( illiteracy did not prevent him from developing philosophies , as you 've already witnessed ) . I was then in my mid-thirties . After the dentist , there were no other men and , as a result , I never left home , which is our custom for unmarried women and men , a loathsome custom but difficult to overthrow . We all must pick our battles , and my acquiring English , which my parents naturally knew not a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or at least till they expired . <p> This dinner at Lutce has come and gone , and you have n't tasted a thing . It 's what happens when we converse over much and do not concentrate on the food . At home , we ate in the silence of A-Ba 's rage . <p> What a shame , but never mind , I promise to share the bounty next time . This meal must have been good because the bill is in the thousands . I pay by traveler 's checks because , not believing in debt , I own no credit cards . <p> Last night 's dinner weighs badly , despite my excellent digestion , so I take a long walk late in the afternoon and end up in Chelsea . New York streets are dirtier than I imagined . Although I did not really expect pavements of gold , in my deepest fantasies , there did reign a glitter and sheen . <p> No one talks to me here . <p> The air is fetid with the day 's leftover heat and odors . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a body on the corner of Twenty-fourth and Seventh . It can not be a corpse ! Surely cadavers are n't left to rot in the streets . <p> A-Ma used to tell of a childhood occurrence in her village . An itinerant had stolen food from the local pig trough . The villagers caught him , beat him senseless , cut off his tongue and arms , and left him to bleed to death behind the rubbish heap . In the morning , my mother was at play , and while running , tripped over the body . She fell into a blood pool beside him . The corpse 's eyes were open . <p> He surely did n't mean to steal , she always said in the telling , her eyes burning from the memory . Try to forget , my father would say . My parents specialized in memory . They both remained lucid and clear-headed till they died . <p> But this body moves . It 's a man awakening from sleep . He mumbles something . Startled , I move away . He is still speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I escape . A taxi whisks me back to my hotel , where my table is reserved at the restaurant . <p> The ceiling at the Oak Room is roughly four times the height of an average basketball player . The ambience is not as seductive as promised by the Plaza 's literature . The problem with reading the wrong kind of literature is that you are bound to be disappointed . <p> This is a man 's restaurant , with a menu of many steaks . Hemingway and Fitzgerald used to eat here . Few of my students have heard of these two , and none of them will have read a single book by either author . <p> As an English teacher , especially one who was not employed at a " name school " of the elite , I became increasingly marginal . Colleagues and friends converse in Cantonese , the only official language out of our three that people live as well as speak . The last time any student read an entire novel was well over twenty years ago . English Literature is not on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Chinese colony is as irresponsible as it was of me to master it in our former British one . <p> Teaching English is little else than a linguistic requirement . Once , it was my passion and flight away from home . Now it is merely my entre to this former men 's club . <p> But I must order dinner and stop thinking about literature . <p> The entres make my head spin , so I turn to the desserts . There is no gooseberry tart ! Ever since David Copperfield , I have wanted to taste a gooseberry tart ( or perhaps it was another book , I do n't remember ) . I tell the boy with the water jug this . <p> He says . " The magician , madam ? " <p> " The orphan , " I reply . <p> He stands , open-mouthed , without pouring water . What is this imbecility of the young ? They neither serve nor wait . <p> The waiter appears . " Can I help with the menu ? " <p> " Why ? " I snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what upsets me is the memory of my mother 's story , which I 'd long forgotten until this afternoon , just as I hoped to forget about the teaching of English Literature , about the uselessness of the life I prepared so hard for . <p> The waiter hovers . " Are you feeling okay ? " <p> I look up at the sound of his voice and realize my hands are shaking . Calming myself , I say . " Au jus . The prime rib , please , and escargots to start , " and on and on I go , ordering in the manner of a man who retreats to a segregated club , who indulges in oblivion because he can , who shuts out the stirrings of the groin and the heart . <p> I wake to a ringing phone . Housekeeping wants to know if they may clean . It 's already past noon . This must be jet lag . I tell Housekeeping , Later . <p> It 's so comfortable here that I believe it is possible to forget . <p> I order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve brunch buffets on weekends . The first time I went to one , Veronica paid . We were both students at university . She was n't wealthy , but her parents gave her spending money , whereas my entire salary ( I was already a working teacher by then ) belonged to my parents . The array of food made my mouth water . Pace yourself , Veronica said . It 's all you can eat . I wanted to try everything , but gluttony frightened me . <p> Meanwhile , A-Ba 's voice . After four or more days without food , your stomach begins to eat itself , and his laugh , dry and caustic . <p> But I was choosing brunch . <p> Mimosa . Smoked salmon . Omelet with Swiss cheese and chives . And salad , the expensive kind that 's imported back home , crisp Romaine in a Caesar . Room Service asks what I 'd like for dessert , so I say chocolate ice cream sundae . Perhaps I 'm more of a bumpkin than I care to admit . My colleagues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unsophisticated , lacking in culinary imagination . They 're right , I suppose , since everything I 've eaten since coming to New York I could just as easily have obtained back home . They ca n't understand , though . It 's not what but how much . How opulent . The opulence is what counts to stop the cannibalism of internal organs . <p> Will that be all ? <p> I am tempted to say , Bring me an endless buffet , whatever your chef concocts , whatever your tongues ' desire . <p> How long till my money runs out , my finite account , ending this sweet exile ? <p> Guest Relations knocks , insistent . I have not let anyone in for three days . I open the door wide to show the manager that everything is fine , that their room is not wrecked , that I am not crazy even if I 'm not on the social register . If you read the news , as I do , you know it 's necessary to allay fears . So I do , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not a diva or an excessively famous person who trashes hotel rooms because she can . <p> I say , politely , that I 've been a little unwell , nothing serious , and to please have Housekeeping stop in now . The " please " is significant ; it shows I am not odd , that I am , in fact , cognizant of civilized language in English . The manager withdraws , relieved . <p> For dinner tonight , I decide on two dozen oysters , lobster , and filet mignon . I select a champagne and the wines , one white and one red . Then , it occurs to me that since this is a suite , I can order enough food for a party , so I tell Room Service that there will be a dozen guests for dinner , possibly more . Very good , he says , and asks how many extra bottles of champagne and wine , to which I reply , As many as needed . <p> My students will be my guests . They more or less were visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think I was always disillusioned , though I seem so now . To prove it to you I 'll invite all my colleagues , the few friends I have , like Veronica , the dentist who courted me and his wife and two children , even Kwai-sin and my parents . I bear no grudges ; I am not bitter towards them . What I 'm uncertain of is whether or not they will come to my supper . <p> This room , this endless meal , can save me . I feel it . I am vanquishing my fear of death and opulence . <p> There was a time we did not care about opulence and we dared to speak of death . You spoke of famine because everyone knew the stories from China were true . Now , even in this country , people more or less know . You could educate students about starvation in China or Africa or India because they knew it to be true , because they saw the hunger around them , among the beggars in our streets , and for some , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was better not to have space , or things to put in that space , and to dream of having instead , because no one had much , except royalty and movie stars and they were meant to be fantasyuntouchable , unreal-somewhere in a dream of manna and celluloid . <p> But you ca n't speak of famine anymore . Anorexia 's fashionable and desirably profitable on runways , so students simply cant see the hunger . My colleagues and friends also ca n't , and refuse to speak of it , changing the subject to what they prefer to see . Even our journalists ca n't seem to see , preferring the reality they fashion rather than the reality that is . I get angry , but then , when I 'm calm , I am simply baffled . Perhaps my parents , and friends and colleagues and memory , are right , that I am too stubborn , perhaps even too slothful because instead of seeing reality , I 've hidden in my parents ' home , in my life as a teacher , even though the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what I desired , was to embrace the opulence , forsake the hunger , but was too lazy to turn the cookie instead . <p> I must n't be angry at them , by which I mean all the " thems " I know and do n't know , the big impersonal " they . " Like a good English teacher I tell my students , you must define the " they . " Students are students and continue to make the same mistakes , and all I can do is remind them that " they " are you and to please , please , try to remember because language is a root of life . <p> Most of the people ca n't be wrong all the time . Besides , whose fault is it if the dream came true ? Post-dream is like post-modern ; no one understands it , but everyone condones its existence . <p> Furthermore , what you ca n't , or wo n't see , does n't exist . <p> Comfort , like food , exists , surrounds me here . <p> Not wishing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like the Romans , I disgorge and continue . It takes hours to eat three lobsters and three steaks , plus consume five glasses of champagne and six of wine , yet still the food is not enough . <p> The guests arrive and more keep coming . Who would have thought all these people would show up , all these people I thought I left behind . Where do they come from ? My students , colleagues , the dentist and his family , a horde of strangers . Even Kwai-sin and her silly hats , and do you know something , we do look a little alike , so Peter Martin was n't completely wrong . I changed my language to change my life , but still the past throngs , bringing all these people and their Cantonese chatter . The food is not enough , the food is never enough . <p> Room Service obliges round the clock . <p> Veronica arrives , and I feel a great relief , because the truth is , I no longer cared for her anymore when all we ate was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forgetting that once she fed me my first buffet , teasing my appetite . Come out , travel , she urged over the years . It 's not her fault I stayed at home , afraid to abandon my responsibility , traveling only in my mind . <p> Finally , my parents arrive . My father sits down first to the feast . His leg is whole , and sperm gushes out from between his legs . It 's not so bad here , he says , and gestures for my mother to join him . This is good . A-Ma will eat if A-Ba does , they 're like that , those two . My friends do n't understand , not even Veronica . She repeats now what she often has said , that my parents are " controlling . " Perhaps , I say , but that 's unimportant . I 'm only interested in not being responsible anymore . <p> The noise in the room is deafening . We can barely hear each other above the din . Cantonese is a noisy language , unlike Mandarin or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too empty is stuffed with people , all needing to be fed . <p> I gaze at the platters of food , piled in this space with largesse . What does it matter if there are too many mouths to feed ? A phone call is all it takes to get more food , and more . I am fifty-one and have waited too long to eat . They 're right , they 're all right . If I give in , if I let go , I will vanquish my fears . This is bliss , truly . <p> A-Ma smiles at the vast quantities of food . This pleases me because she so rarely smiles . She says , Not like lazy cookie man , hah ? <p> Feeling benevolent , I smile at my parents . No , not like him , I say . Now , eat . <p>
