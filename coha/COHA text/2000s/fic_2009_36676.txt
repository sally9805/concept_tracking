Lara had brought the convenience of faerie post to Terah many years before . Now she marshaled the tiny messengers , sending them throughout Terah announcing the unexpected death of the Dominus Magnus Hauk . The leaders of all the villages were instructed to gather at a central meeting place assigned to each of the seven fjords , at a specific time on the day of Magnus Hauk 's funeral . The headmen and - women of the New Outland families were also sent similar instructions . The mountain gnomes were also invited to participate . Her husband 's funeral would be a grand one . <p> Lara thought back to the time she had managed the funeral of her first husband , Vartan , Lord of the Fiacre . She had been a young girl with two small children then , one a baby . Now her eldest son , Dillon , was a man grown with his own wife . Her eldest daughter , Anoush , was also grown . The three children she had borne Magnus Hauk were still fledglings . Well , perhaps not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was n't she ? Lara sighed sadly . <p> She was finally beginning to understand the curse of being faerie with mortal offspring . Her children were aging . But she was not . <p> " Mother ? " Anoush had come to stand by her side . <p> " Yes , my darling , " Lara answered the daughter she had borne Vartan of the Fiacre twenty-one years ago . <p> " I have a crystal that will ease the pain , " Anoush volunteered . <p> " Nay , " Lara said softly . " Magnus Hauk 's memory is more than worthy of my pain , but thank you . " Reaching out , she patted Anoush 's small , pale , blue-veined hand . This first daughter of hers was so fragile while the other two were healthy . Zagiri might even be called sturdy . How different they all were . There was n't a magical bone in Zagiri 's body despite her bloodline while Anoush had the Sight and was an instinctive healer of mind , body and soul . Her gift was both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so intuitive and sensitive herself she suffered along with those who sought her help . <p> As for her youngest daughter , Marzina , she was , like Dillon , extremely magical and had proven so at an early age . Born a twin to her brother , Taj , Marzina had not been sired by Magnus Hauk although it was generally believed she had been . The seed from which Marzina had blossomed was that of Kol , the Twilight Lord , who had forced himself upon Lara on the Dream Plain . For this crime Kol was now imprisoned , his kingdom in chaos . No one had ever questioned Marzina 's paternity but for Lara 's mother , who had been present at the twins ' birth and declared she looked like a Nix relation . <p> Lara felt a tear slip down her cheek . She rarely wept , but now suddenly the tears flowed for Magnus Hauk , who had been so good to all of her children . Anoush wrapped her mother in her embrace , and sobbing Lara accepted her daughter 's comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden head . " It is n't fair ! " She voiced aloud her frustration and her despair over her husband 's sudden demise . <p> " I know , " Anoush agreed , " but when has life ever been fair , Mother ? Was it fair when my uncle killed my father , Vartan ? " <p> Lara drew away from her eldest daughter . " Nay , it was not fair then , nor is it fair now , Anoush . I shall not wed again . The men I marry seem to meet with untimely ends . " <p> " You do not need to marry , " Anoush replied , and suddenly her blue eyes glazed over . " You are loved without the bonds of marriage . And you have your destiny to consider . It draws closer , but you are still not ready to receive it . There is time yet . " Then Anoush slumped against Lara . " Mother ? " she whispered a moment later . <p> " It 's all right , my darling , " Lara comforted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Was it important ? " Anoush wanted to know , for she never recalled these moments when she saw into the future . <p> Before Lara might answer Anoush her two younger daughters burst into her dayroom shrieking with terrible distress . <p> Zagiri threw herself into her mother 's arms . " Is it true ? " she sobbed . " No ! No ! It can not be true ! Tell me our father is n't dead ? " <p> Lara 's sorrow evaporated as her anger arose . " It is true , Zagiri , " she said . " Now who has usurped my right to bring you this awful news ? " <p> " Grandmother Persis , " Marzina quickly replied , for Zagiri was incapable of answering , so great was her grief . She had been Magnus Hauk 's firstborn , and he had without meaning to tended to favor her . <p> " The old bitch ! " Lara hissed softly . " Where is Taj ? " <p> " With her , " Marzina answered her mother . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she could n't send your sister into hysterics , " Lara said angrily . She turned to the weeping Zagiri , and gathered the girl into her arms . There was nothing she could say that would comfort this daughter of Magnus Hauk , but she cradled and rocked the girl until Zagiri 's sobs subsided . <p> " How did Father die ? " Marzina asked sanguinely , her eyes filled with tears . <p> Zagiri 's woebegone face looked up at Lara now . <p> " The main mast of your uncle Corrado 's new ship was being set into place . It shattered , broke and fell onto your father and uncle . Your uncle will survive . Your father 's injuries were mortal . He called for me , for Kaliq , your grandmother and Taj so his last wishes might be heard , and swore us to uphold them . " <p> " Could n't you have saved him , Mother ? " Zagiri asked Lara now , pulling away from her mother 's embrace . " You are faerie ! What good are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man you love ? " she asked angrily , irrationally . <p> " Aye , I am faerie , but sustaining mortal life is beyond my powers . His wounds were fatal . It was all I could do to help him live long enough to make his last wishes known , Zagiri , " Lara told her daughter . " I am sorry you had to learn of your father 's death in this fashion . It was not up to your grandmother to tell you , and I can see that she did it badly . But we will survive , my darlings . We are together , and your father would want us to honor his memory by living our lives as he would want us to do . " <p> Zagiri sniffed . <p> " You are so selfish , " Marzina told Zagiri . " All you think about is yourself . How do you think our mother feels having to have watched our father die , and not be able to help him ? Is her grief nothing to you , Zagiri ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where is our mother 's grief ? " Zagiri said bitterly . " I do not see it . " <p> " I have seen it , " Anoush told her younger sister . " Before you entered this chamber I held our mother while she wept for Magnus Hauk . And she will continue to grieve in private I know . But now she must take up the duties of the Dominus if Terah is to survive . When word of our father 's death reaches across the sea to Hetar do you think they will remain peaceful knowing my brother , the new Dominus , is yet a boy ? Our mother has much to do if Terah is to remain strong . Her sorrow must be private , Zagiri . She needs her strength to save us all . " <p> Zagiri was suddenly remorseful . " Oh , Mother , I did not realize " Then she gasped . " A woman ruling Terah ? What will the people say ? " <p> To all intents and purposes Taj will rule Terah , Lara answered Zagiri . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guided me . When your brother is capable I will step aside , and he will rule without me . " <p> " You will be a Shadow Queen then , " Marzina said with just the hint of a smile . <p> Lara smiled . " Aye , I shall remain in the shadows so that the customs of Terah not be offended or disturbed . I promised your father that , and I will honor my promise . " <p> " Grandmother Per sis will not like it , " Zagiri murmured . <p> " But she will accept it , " Lara responded . " She gave your father her sacred word as he lay dying . So did Kaliq , your uncle and aunt . The last wishes of Magnus Hauk will be honored , my daughters . Now leave me . I have already sent faerie posts to the elders , and the New Outlands , but I must inform the High Priest Arik at the Temple of the Great Creator , and Kemina , High Priestess at the Temple of the Daughters of the Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct your father 's funeral service . Tell your brother to come to me , and see that your grandmother stays out of mischief . " <p> " Dillon should be told , " Anoush reminded her mother . <p> Lara nodded as her daughter left her presence . There was so much to do , she thought . And so little time in which to accomplish all that needed doing . By Terahn law Magnus Hauk 's Farewell Ceremony had to be completed within three days . She had already decided that the burning vessel that carried his body out to the sea would be that very one that had been responsible for his death . She knew that Captain Corrado would agree , for no Terahn would ever sail upon the ship that had caused the demise of Magnus Hauk . Lara sighed . How much time had passed since her husband 's death ? An hour ? Two ? She was both numb and aching at the same time . <p> " Mother ? " <p> She looked up to see her son , Taj . His face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord Dominus , " she replied to him . " Sit down . We must talk . " <p> " It is too soon , " the boy said tearfully . <p> Lara shook her head . " Nay , " she told him . " You are your father 's heir . There is no time for self-indulgence , Taj . You are Magnus Hauk 's son , and you will be , must be strong in the face of this tragedy . Once it is known that your father is gone , and you rule in Terah , our enemies will gather and plot , and seek to gain an advantage over us . You can not let that happen . And I will help you with the aid of the High Priest Arik , and others , Taj . But never will I appear by your side . I will stand in the shadows behind your throne until you are old enough and wise enough to rule without me . Terah will see you , accept you as their Dominus from this terrible day forward . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Taj responded . <p> Lara smiled . " Of course you do n't , " she told him . " It was never expected that you be Dominus so young . Your father and I wanted our children to have a happy childhood without the cares that accompany adulthood . " <p> " Teach me , " Taj said . " What must I do first ? " <p> It pleased her that he had pushed his grief aside , and begun asking questions . " You will call the chief scribe , Ampyx , to you . Then you will dictate an official announcement of your father 's death , and your right of inheritance . You will then order that it be sent by faerie post to be published throughout all of Terah . I have already notified the elders of the seven fjords , the religious , and the New Outlanders in your name . It was necessary , for by custom the Farewell must be done on the third day . I will bring them all here with my magic , " Lara said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Will you be with me when I speak to him , Mother ? " <p> " I will not be with you , " Lara replied . " Remember it must appear from the start that you are in total charge , my son . Here is what you must dictate to Ampyx . You will say that it is with great sorrow you must bring the news of your father 's death to his beloved people . That as his only natural-born son you have taken the right of inheritance . Then have Ampyx sign this document in the name of Taj Hauk , Dominus of Terah . " <p> " I will go to the throne room now , " Taj told Lara . <p> " Aye , " she agreed . Then they both stood , and Lara embraced her young son . " Go , " she said to him . <p> The boy strode bravely from his mother 's apartments , and hurried through the castle to the official chamber where his father had formally received guests and dignitaries from other worlds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , standing before it , called out , " Send for the chief scribe , Ampyx ! " To his own surprise his voice did not tremble . And while the chamber appeared empty Taj knew there was always a servant discreetly in attendance there day and night . <p> " At once , my lord ! " a voice called . <p> Taj sat heavily upon his father 's throne . He wondered how long it would take for him to think of it as his throne . Then he composed himself , and considered the words he would utter to Ampyx . His mother had laid out the boundaries for him , but she knew he was an intelligent boy , and would want to speak from his own heart . Taj smiled . His mother was a very clever woman , and there was much he could learn from her . His grandmother had told him he should not listen to any woman , but rule in his own right . But Taj Hauk knew he needed his mother 's counsel now . His father had with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Magnus Hauk would not have done such a thing if he had not felt it was the right thing to do . <p> " My lord ? " <p> Taj raised his head from his thoughts and stood up . " Chief Scribe , I would dictate to you , " he said . <p> Ampyx immediately sat down cross-legged upon the marble floor and drew out his writing board , parchment , pen and a small stone bottle of ink . " I am ready , my lord . " <p> " It is with deep sorrow that I announce the sudden death No . Write , the sudden and accidental death of Dominus Magnus Hauk , this tenth day in the first month of the planting season . His Farewell Ceremony will be held as custom dictates on the third day following his demise . All of his beloved people who can attend are welcome at the castle . " Taj stopped , and considered carefully his next words as the head scribe looked up at him . Then Taj continued . " As Magnus Hauk 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He looked to the chief scribe . " Read my words back to me , Ampyx . " <p> The tiniest of smiles touched the head scribe 's lips , and then he read back the words that had just been dictated to him . <p> When he had finished the boy added , " Sign it Taj Hauk , Dominus of Terah . " Then considering again he asked ingenuously , " Have I forgotten anything , Ampyx ? " <p> " Nay , my lord.Your words are just as they should be . " He arose from the floor and bowed to the boy . " May I offer you my own condolences , my lord Dominus , on the death of your great father ? " <p> " You may , " Taj replied formally . " I thank you . " Then , remembering , he said , " See my words are published this day throughout the kingdom from the Sea of Sagitta to the Obscura in the New Outlands .
