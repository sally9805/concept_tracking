It 's not every day that coral reefs make headlines , so it was a surprise last week when they were in the news three times . Although most of the reports , published in the journal Science , were discouraging , there was at least some hope that the future of these fragile formations might not be as bleak as environmentalists fear . <P> The worst news came out of a joint U.S.-Australian study in which scientists announced that the world 's coral reefs may have only a few decades to live . The two biggest threats are diseases , which hit harder when coral organisms are environmentally stressed , and bleaching  --  the loss of beneficial algae due to rising global temperatures . The investigators involved in the study believe human impact goes back much further , to our hunter-gatherer days . Analyzing the evolutionary history of 14 reefs around the world , they found evidence of ancient , land-based pollution that has long been toxic to coral . Additionally , centuries of overfishing may have disrupted the food chain , allowing the overgrowth of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This accumulated stress has made reefs vulnerable to modern disease . " The patient is terminally ill , " says marine biologist John Pandolfi of the National Museum of Natural History  --  Smithsonian Institution in Washington , " but the underlying sickness is pollution and overfishing . " <P> Studies headed by the Australian National University show that reefs may be vulnerable to another environmental insult : wildfires . A new report suggests that smoke from 1997 Indonesian fires deposited iron on the surface of the water , leading to the growth of phytoplankton . This caused a so-called red tide that suffocated the coral . The only good reef news comes from a new four-nation study suggesting that while climate change certainly is n't good for coral , the tiny organisms may do better than we think at adapting to new conditions . Species with a tolerance for warmer waters may already be emerging . This flicker of hope notwithstanding , scientists agree that the world 's reefs need to be protected , mostly with stricter pollution controls and expanded " no-take areas , " which keep humans out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeffrey Kluger
