<p> CINCINNATI-After 26 years in a second-floor space above a Walgreens drugstore , this city 's Contemporary Arts Center decided in 1996 to build a home striking enough to put it on the national map . The goal ranged far beyond blueprints and bricks . ' We wanted to have an architect who had demonstrated an ability to be very visionary and forward-thinking , and yet we also wanted someone who had n't really had a break yet , someone who had n't really built a major building perhaps - certainly not a star architect , ' said interim director Andree Hymel Bober . <p> ' We were n't going to go out and try to get Frank Gehry to do this building . ' <p> The resulting $ 30.7 million project - a dramatic , five-story structure with a gracefully blocky in-and-out exterior - sparked worldwide attention when it opened in May . The design transformed London architect Zaha Hadid into an architectural sensation in the United States . <p> The Museum of Contemporary Art/Denver hopes to score a similar architectural coup with a new building it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it with a far more modest structure with a construction budget about one-tenth the size of Cincinnati 's . <p> The institution is considering a 15,000- <p> 18,000-square-foot building on the northwest corner of 15th and Delgany streets , diagonally across from the new Gates Corp . headquarters in the Central Platte Valley . Museum officials estimate its price will be $ 3.6 million to $ 4 million , with additional funds needed for an operations endowment . <p> ' I do n't think we 're there accurately in terms of the building cost . I think it can be less , ' said Karl Kister , president of the museum 's board of trustees . ' I 'd really like to show the limits of what we could do - building a great building for very little . It 's an amazing challenge for an architect . ' <p> And architects were apparently eager to take it on . Forty firms responded to the museum 's request for proposals . In December , a selection committee chose six finalists , generally mid-career architects and all with international reputations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make presentations to the museum 's board and public . <p> The big question : Is the proposed compact structure the right size for Denver , whose metropolitan-area population of 2.5 million is 800,000 more than Cincinnati 's ? Museum leaders say yes , considering its relatively short history and the city 's mixed record of private support for the visual arts . <p> ' For right now , for Denver and all the resources that we have to pull on , this is workable . I think bigger would be a disaster and smaller would be embarrassing , ' said Mark Sink , a photography gallery owner , who serves on the contemporary art museum board . <p> Contemporary art boom <p> Although some cities have had contemporary museums for decades , there has been a boom in establishing such institutions in the past two decades . The Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art in Kansas City , Mo. , for example , opened in a 23,200-square-foot building in 1994 and now draws more than 120,000 visitors a year . <p> Rachael Blackburn , the museum 's director , attributes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general , a phenomenon she ties to the business world 's new emphasis on creativity in a time when new technologies and constant change make adaptability and innovation more important than ever . <p> At the same time , she said , a growing number of cities see these museums as key components among the cultural amenities they tout when trying to lure companies and high-level recruits . <p> ' I think it 's become a sort of barometer for how cosmopolitan or how successful or how forward- <p> thinking a city is , ' Blackburn said . <p> Mayor John Hickenlooper , a follower of Richard Florida , author of the much-discussed book ' The Rise of the Creative Class : And How It 's Transforming Work , Leisure , Community and Everyday Life , ' seems to agree . He made a point of attending the Museum of Contemporary Art/Denver 's annual gala in October . <p> If Denver is ahead of some similar-sized cities such as Indianapolis , which is just now organizing a contemporary art museum , it lags far behind many others , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just 10 years after the Museum of Modern Art in New York City . <p> The Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis , which opened an $ 8.5 million minimalist building in the Grand Center Creative and Cultural District in September , dates to 1980 , when civic , cultural and educational groups banded together to bring visual arts and cultural activities to downtown . <p> Three artists start museum <p> Three local artists founded the Museum of Contemporary/Denver in 1996 as an institution that would present changing exhibitions but not have a collection of its own . The approach was similar to the museums in St. Louis and Cincinnati . Since 1998 , it has occupied a 7,000-square-foot space at 1275 19th St. in Sakura Square . <p> Supporters say the relatively short history of the contemporary art museum as well as still-developing support for the visual arts in Denver - especially contemporary art - explain why the proposed size and scale for the institution 's new building makes sense . <p> ' Just looking at the climate we have here , ' Kister said , ' and the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed to the point where we even know the limits of that pool , we thought : What would be the most responsible way to spend any of the money we are to raise ? ' <p> Director/curator Cydney Payton envisions a flexible , ' radiantly elegant yet simple ' structure that emphasizes the art and not itself , giving viewers a more direct experience of the works on view with as little architectural interference as possible . <p> ' All my examples are grander , I think , than the simplicity that we 're seeking , ' Payton said . <p> She and her fellow contemporary art museum leaders are still planning a fundraising strategy . But it seems clear the institution will not rely on one set of benefactors such as Crosby Kemper , his wife , Bebe , and the Kemper family foundations that underwrote the $ 6.6 million construction cost for the museum in Kansas City that carries the family name . <p> Funding not easy <p> Mark Addison , a Boulder art collector who serves on the boards of the Denver Art Museum and University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comparatively modest funds the museum will need for its new building will not be easy . <p> He discovered how hard such a process can be several years ago , when he tried to raise $ 5 million in private funds for a $ 44 million visual-arts complex , which would have included space for the CU Art Museum . That project was put on hold because of state cutbacks in university funding . <p> Although the contemporary art museum 's planned building might be smaller than that of many of its counterparts in similar-sized cities , there is no reason the structure has to be the institution 's home forever , said Blackburn , the Kemper 's director . <p> The structure could serve as a transitional facility , with the institution eventually relocating or expanding when it is more firmly established and contemporary art has a stronger foothold in Denver . <p> " Maybe that 's not a bad idea , to sort of get something going , " she said .
