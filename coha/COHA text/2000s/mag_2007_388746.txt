Headnote What regulates the flow of huge ice streams ? // Imagine the consternation that your high school physics teacher would have shown if , during a lab demonstration , the little wheeled block placed on an inclined plane had violated the law of gravity . Imagine the block sometimes speeding up , sometimes slowing down , and sometimes stopping dead on the slope . Scientists have faced a similar situation as they 've studied some of Antarctica 's most massive glaciers . The researchers are eager to understand the behavior of these ice streams because they have considerable influence on sea levels worldwide . Scientists estimate that ice streams contribute about 90 percent of the ice flowing directly off Antarctica into the surrounding sea . However , " we ca n't now predict how much ice will flow into the sea in the future , " says Ted A. Scambos , a glaciologist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder , Colo . Some factors that influence ice streams are well known , but others are just being revealed . New findings show complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into models of how such ice behaves , Scambos notes . New studies bolster the notion that bodies of water beneath glaciers accelerate the streams by warming the ice and lubricating its flow . Other recent research hints that immense volumes of sediment that the streams scrape oft the continent pile up where the ice meets the sea . This sediment may act as a buttress to slow ice flow . Furthermore , Antarctic field studies suggest that the Kamb Ice Stream stopped in its tracks 150 years ago . The neighboring Whillans Ice Stream is slowing significantly and , at the current rate of deceleration , may shut down a little more than a century from now . So far , scientists ca n't fully explain these unusual slowdowns . Factors that affect the flow rates of ice streams operate at many time scales . Ocean tides produce daily and weekly variations in flow speed at some locations , while the draining and filling of subglacial lakes and the climate cycles , such as ice ages , appear to cause variations over decades , centuries , or millennia . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been triggered by cooling that occurred during the Little Ice Age several centuries ago . GOING DOWNHILL All the ice in Antarctica eventually flows to the sea . Just as the water flowing off warm landmasses reaches the sea via rivers , most of the ice spilling off Antarctica and Greenland is carried by ice streams . These massive glaciers typically flow much faster than nearby ice does . Many ice streams are unexplored , and others have n't been visited by scientists in decades . Some of these flows did n't even have names until about 5 years ago . Many ice streams nourish broad regions of floating ice that remain attached to the land at their upstream boundaries , or grounding lines . These floating masses , called ice shelves , connect to about 44 percent of the continent 's coast . Some regions of ice flow much faster than others . For example , one section of an ice stream can flow hundreds of times faster than a higher area nearby does . Several factors affect the flow rate of an ice stream , says Richard Hindmarsh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The temperature of the ice plays a big role . Ice flows more rapidly at 0C than does ice at - 10C , he notes , because viscosity at the higher temperature is only 10 percent of that at the lower temperature . The roughness and grade of the terrain underlying the ice are other major influences on flow rate . They affect the friction at the base of the ice stream . In most locations , friction at the base of an ice stream changes slowly , if at all . However , that 's not the case where these megaglaciers meet the sea and are supported by the water rather than by underlying terrain . Near the grounding line , the effects of ocean tides become readily apparent , says Sridhar Anandakrishnan , a glaciologist at Pennsylvania State University in University Park . For example , the tide influences how forcefully an ice stream presses against the shoreline terrain , Anandakrishnan notes . Some ice streams come to a halt twice a day , typically near low tide , when they weigh most heavily against the streambed . Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's weight , the ice stream surges forward , thereby decreasing the friction on the ground just inland . Because of this surge-and-stall behavior , scientists must carefully synchronize their measurements with tidal cycles to accurately estimate an ice stream 's overall velocity , says Anandakrishnan . New data suggest that ocean tides can cause the velocity of an ice stream to vary not only over the course of a day but also over the course of a month . Glaciologist G. Hilmar Gudmundsson of the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge , England , examined the Rutford Ice Stream in western Antarctica . That stream is 150 kilometers long , 25 km wide , and as much as 3 km thick . Gudmundsson used global positioning system ( GPS ) equipment to measure the rate of ice flow at several points on the Rutford Ice Stream every 5 minutes between late December 2003 and mid-February 2004 . On average , the ice in that stream slides seaward about 1 meter each day , he found . However , ice-stream velocity varied significantly during the 7-week period . At neap tides-the exceptionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its quarter phases-the ice stream 's peak velocity measured about 0.90 m/day at the grounding line . During the highest tides of the month-the so-called spring tides that occur when the moon is full or new-the ice stream clocked in at a velocity of 1.15 m/day . Gudmundsson s report , the first to describe fortnightly , tidally induced variations in ice-stream velocity , appeared in the Dec. 28 , 2006 Nature . Similar biweekly variations in ice-stream velocity were observed at all sites where Gudmundsson had installed the GPS equipment , even at a spot 40 km inland of the ice stream 's grounding line . seeing a tidal effect at such a distance " was a total surprise , " says Gudmundsson . " For such a large mass of ice to respond to ocean tides like this illustrates how sensitively the Antarctic ice sheet reacts to environmental changes . " SLIPPIN " SLIDE Scientists have long presumed that an ice stream can move more rapidly when water lubricates its base . Field studies and data gathered by satellites now directly demonstrate the link between ice streams and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a **26;6194;TOOLONG area of eastern Antarctica , penetrates farther into the continent 's interior than any other ice stream , says Michael Studinger , a glaciologist at Columbia University 's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades , N.Y . By combining new satellite observations and field data gathered decades ago , Studinger and his colleagues have identified four immense subglacial lakes beneath the ice stream . Together , the lakes stretch across the upper reaches of the Recovery Ice Stream 's catchment area , a distance of more than 350 km . They cover an area of about 13,300 km2 , about half the size of North America 's Lake Erie . Ice over the lakes is flat , featureless , and more than 3 km thick , the researchers report in the Feb. 22 Nature . Upstream of the newly discovered lakes , ice velocities clock in at only about 2 m/yr , says Studinger . Then , where the ice stream flows onto a lake , it suddenly speeds up . Over a lake , the flowing ice floats on water and experiences almost no friction , the researchers note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upstream lakeshore , creating a distinctive , broad trough a few meters deep . Similarly , when the ice reaches the downstream shore of the lake , it decelerates in response to the friction there . That slowdown generates a small ridge in the ice stream 's surface . Immediately downstream of the lakes , the ice stream flows at rates between 20 and 30 m/yr . That 's faster than upstream of the lakes because the stream 's bottom surface soaked up heat during its several-millennium-long trip across the lakes , says Studinger . Also , water flowing from the lakes , either in trickles or in occasional floods , probably lubricates the base of the ice stream . Even farther downstream of the lakes , the ice zips along at an impressive 100 m/yr . Coincidentally , Anandakrishnan and another team of scientists report that they 've discovered a shallow body of water beneath the head of an ice stream in western Antarctica . During the 2002-2003 field season , the researchers collected seismic data along a 16.7-km stretch of a tributary of the Bindschadler Ice Stream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the researchers inferred the characteristics of the rock and sediments that underlie the region . Under most of the sites that they studied , a layer of sediment 5 to 20 m thick was sandwiched between the base of the ice stream and the bedrock , says Anandakrishnan . Some segments of the streambed were lined with well-packed sediment , where seismic waves of the type that transmits shear forces through the ground traveled about 1 km per second . In other sections , the ice rested on loosely packed sediment , where shear waves traveled less than 200 m/s . Along one kilometer-long portion of the streambed , the scientists received no reflections of shear waves at all-a sign that a pocket of water sat beneath the ice stream . The time lag in the echoes of other seismic waves indicated that the water was between 5 and 10 m deep , Anandakrishnan and his team report in the March Geology . There 's evidence of recent water movement beneath the ice stream . In 2005 , researchers reported that a kilometers-wide region of ice upstream of the seismic survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the same interval , a broad region about 10 km downstream of the survey site rose about 50 cm . That change reflects a surge of about 10 million cubic meters of water , the team calculated . Occasional floods and the long dry spells in between may contribute to the irregular behavior of ice streams , says Scambos . WEDGE ISSUE As ice streams wend their way to the sea , they scour the landscape , shattering the underlying bedrock into particles ranging from boulders to fine grounds called rock flour . Some of this material becomes embedded in the lowermost layers of ice . When the stream reaches the sea , some of the particles stay in the icebergs that break off and float away . The particles eventually melt and scatter the detritus across distant seafloors . Other material remains onshore and lines the streambed . Much of the rest is bulldozed off the continent by the advancing ice and ends up just offshore . Observations of the continental shelf beneath the open water off Antarctica have revealed many such deposits . Each is typically between 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wedgeshaped , with the narrow portion of the wedge pointing toward shore . The wedges were laid down by ice streams during the last ice age , which ended around 10,000 years ago . Then , sea levels were more than 100 m lower than they are today , and the streams had to flow much farther to reach the ocean , says Anandakrishnan . The sediment deposits were left behind as sea levels rose and the ice streams retreated . Up and down each ancient channel , they 're spaced about 50 km apart . Similar deposits probably lie beneath the floating ice shelves that rim much of Antarctica , but scientists ca n't yet conduct surveys of those areas to confirm the features ' presence . However , a seismic survey of the Whillans Ice Stream at its grounding line shows that a wedge of sediment is accumulating there . " It 's being replenished as we speak , " says Anandakrishnan . The seismic reflections from the terrain beneath the ice stream suggest that the wedge is no more than 30 m or so thick . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anandakrishnan says that the wedge may extend another 10 km or so offshore of the grounding line , but the water beneath the ice shelf interferes with the echoes of seismic-shear waves and so masks any underlying material . Anandakrishnan and his colleagues describe their findings in the March 30 Science . Data also show that ice is piling up atop the sediment wedge at the grounding line , so the wedge appears to act as a speed bump for the ice stream , says Anandakrishnan . The extra weight stabilizes the location of the grounding line because modest rises in sea levelincreases of 5 m or less , the team 's models suggest-would n't cause the ice stream to float free . The wedges buttressing effect slows down the ice flow from the continent-an important role , to be sure . Because Antarctica holds about 90 percent of the world 's land-based ice , scientists have long been concerned about a surge in the rate of Antarctic ice reaching the ocean . There 's enough ice there to boost worldwide sea level by 60 m . Global warming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be only part of the problem . Computer models suggest another factor : Ice streams often accelerate when the ice shelf into which they flow disappears ( SN : 2/3/01 , p. 70 ) , potentially boosting sea level . Indeed , five of the six large glaciers flowing into the Larsen A Ice Shelf accelerated soon after that mass of ice disintegrated early in 1995 ( SN : 3/8/03 , p. 149 ) . With the host of new findings-including the subglacial lakes that tend to accelerate ice streams and the sediment wedges that hold them in check-researchers expect to improve their predictions of icestream behavior . " These are incredible discoveries , " says Scambos . " They 're a big plus for modeling of the Antarctic ice sheet . " Slowly but surely , scientists are discovering the factors that underlie previously puzzling megaglacier behavior . The ice streams are n't defying gravity , after all . As Scambos says , " It 's all about the balance between friction and freezing .
