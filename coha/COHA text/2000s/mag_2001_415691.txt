ON THE COAST OF OREGON , ATOP HUNDRED-FOOT CLIFFS , TOM DOAK AND MIKE KEISER ARE ABOUT TO UNVEIL WHAT MAY BE ... // IN ARCHITECTURE , MANY CONNECTIONS ARE CALLED MOMENTS . The column meets a beam . That 's a moment . The roofline meets its peak . Another moment . When my brother Frank was an architecture student , we stood in a parking garage in Salt Lake City and he told me , " To get my license , I 'd have to be capable of calculating every moment in this whole place . " 91 I looked around . " How many moments is that ? " ql His eyes went wide . " Hundreds , " he said . " Maybe thousands . " Iq Since then , it 's been hard for me to see most average human structures as anything other than massive skeletons of stress points . The shopping mall . The highway overpass . My dentist 's office . One moment after another , one indistinguishable from the next . Even the average golf course , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seems a mere string of calculations to mesculpted rise , gentle berm , scalloped edges of the pond . The same mind-numbing visual language from one course to another . qT But then there are the great courses-Augusta , Pine Valley , Pinehurst No. 2 , Pebble Beach , Sand Hills-each of which can be said to be singular and complete , a thousand decisions nestled inside one vision . On these courses , the level of calculation is a daily puzzle , one that takes a lifetime to sort out . Great courses are a moment unto themselves . As the great course falls into place , word gets out before it is even played . Right now , the word is that it 's happening in a little town in Oregon called Bandon , at a ( public ) course called Pacific Dunes , which opens this July . This is a moment that will begin there and then . It may be the last of its kind . CLICHE DICTATES THAT the world is shrinking . In the matter of golf courses , this is surely so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close . There is n't enough suitable land left in the United States . Developers are properly hamstrung by land-use restrictions , environmental protections , zoning boards . Nor is there enough patience , or talent , or taste , to build them the way they ought to be built . Or money . Not to mention balls . You have to have some large measure of each to build a great golf course . Photograph Photograph // Designer Tom Doak 's scribblings-scrawled shortly after a brush fire cleared the land of near-Impenetrable gorse-became Pacific Dunes . // Even as the fairways grow into their contours , even as the greens grab hold of the sand , even before anyone pays a penny to play it , Pacific Dunes looks ancient , as though it 's been there all along . It looks as though someone picked up the rug and found a golf course , a course confidently featuring the four pillars of greatness-ocean , vegetation , contour , and wind-without relying too much on any one of them . Pacific Dunes sits along a twenty-three-mile stretch of undisturbed Oregon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangle of gorse , sea grass , and sand dunes . This is the sort of place you 'd stand for a look at the world-the dense blue ocean , the heaving surf , the whales , the crab boats , the distant points of sand and rock . It is a place both remote and connected , both distant and familiar , where nature and man press on in their various forms of commerce and decay . You have to picture this land , beaten upon by the surf and the wind , a small river dragging sand to the ocean , the tides heaving it back up into mountainous dunes , which the Coos and Coquille tribes used for centuries as a meeting ground . When the loggers came , a homesick Irishman shipped in several gorse bushes to give the area an Irish flavor . The gorse , far from the cold and bitter soil of the British Isles , where it grows in low clumps , exploded , overtaking everything for sixty miles along the Oregon coast , until the area became a forest of the stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorny as any medieval fairy tale . Being able to build here at all , at this juncture in history , was a matter of patience and luck-that of owner Mike Keiser , who set out to build a great course and nothing less . He started looking in the late eighties , bought the Bandon property five years later , and took three years to get all the permits , variances , and trust needed to break ground . Keiser was in no particular rush . " Every time you start a course like Pacific , you have a chance to build a cathedral , something that will outlast us all . There 's no reason to rush . Plus , we literally could n't walk the land , it was so deep in the gorse . " Things fell together . The strong economy . The decade-long golf boom . The peculiarities of land-use restrictions for Oregon coastline . The surprising assent of the Indian tribes ( who see the land as largely undisturbed by the low-impact design of Pacific Dunes ) . The demise of logging and fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs ) . Even the locals ' hatred of the uncontrollable gorse . These were the X factors that allowed Pacific Dunes to move forward . But the catalyst was a brush fire that consumed four hundred acres of gorseland in late 1999 , allowing Keiser and course designer Tom Doak their first real look at the lay of the land . " The gorse was so deep , you literally could n't see anything before the fire , " said Keiser . " And then , suddenly , there was this golf course right in front of us . " Building the golf course that was presented to them fit the aesthetic of Doak , who disdains heavy equipment and earth moving . He 's a smallish guy , infamously demanding in the matter of course design , who walks the course and plays it in the same pair of ratty work boots . As we play the course , his first time playing all eighteen holes in order , Doak points with pride to the places he did n't work on and apologizes for those places he did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without comment , moving straight to an untouched dune , which he seems to know so intimately it might have a name . " It 's great moving the world around , " he says , studying a thirty-foot ridge of sand replete with the stubble of sea grass . " But all the equipment in the world could n't do this . " WE 'RE STANDING AT THE THIRTEENTH , facing the ocean , playing slowly through the holes at Pacific Dunes . When I ask Doak about making his mark on the game , he wo n't bite . But when asked if the course will last , he is firm . " There are seven holes which run directly into , or along , the shoreline in some way , " he says . " Those are hundred-foot cliffs . I know there are greens which will fall into the water eventually . That 's happened at some of the Irish courses like Ballybunion . But the truth is , that kind of thing will be a lot of fun to deal with in a hundred years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a moment , this architect speaking to another architect , about this one place , a hundred years from now . The new hole suddenly seems , as great holes do , both intentional and accidental , as broad and permanent as the continent itself To the west , the surf works the shore . To the east , a band of workers quietly pulls burnt stumps of gorse from the deep rough by hand . Doak tees it up . The wind picks up from the north . There is no hint of a different past , of a time when the hole was n't there , except for what I can read in the reaction of the workers , who crane their necks . Doak is the first guy they 've seen playing the hole . They want a look . They want the moment to last .
