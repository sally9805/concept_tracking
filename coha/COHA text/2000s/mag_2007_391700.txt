Headnote TECHNOLOGY Move over , iPod : Internet radio captures the enduring magic of the medium and makes the local global . The iPod shows you mainly what 's already going on in your head-it 's cool , but only as cool as solipsism can ever be . I 've got a way cooler device : a squat little box that sits on your kitchen counter or your bedside table and connects you to pretty much the entire Earth . And in so doing makes you think anew about the global and the local and what community amounts to-makes you think about connection , which is , after all , the main topic of our age . It 's a kind of home epistemology center that also happens to rock . Or croon , or wail , or chat , or do anything else a radio can do . Because that 's all I 'm talking about : a table radio , though one that , assuming you have a broadband connection and wireless network in your house , lets you tune in to almost any station anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer will let you do this too ( go to www.reciva.com for a portal that will let you listen in ) , but there 's something about having a little box there in the kitchen-the whole thing is more elegant ( think presets ) , and it connects you with the earliest moments of electronic entertainment . Because radio is , of course , the great survivor medium , a century old and still occupying more hours in the average American 's week than network television-and just about every other type of entertainment , too . At the moment , radio 's most talked-about form is satellite-XM and Sirius , eager to merge their hundred-channel lists of music and talk into something profitable . But given what 's out there for free , it 's hard to imagine why anyone would bother to pay for a satellite subscription ( except for the fairly crucial fact that you can get satellite radio in your car , while easy Web-streaming in transit is still some years off ) . like reggae ? There 's a reggae channel on XM . But if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced by an English company and available from many electronics retailers for about $300-you can listen to seven different stations from Jamaica , including MegaJamz , KOOL FM , and Love 101 . Personally , I enjoy the soca show from Barbados on CBC at 98.1 FM , partly because of the music , partly because of the weather report-always 80 , always breezy-and partly because of the lilting voices of the DJs . " My grandmother always used to tell me , " Never wake up vexed , ' ' " said the lady who does the morning shift one day last month when I was feeling , in fact , a little tense . Something in both that sentiment ( the opposite of the keyed-up political hysterics on our own dial ) and that last choice of word relaxed me-and almost instantly conjured up colonial history with all its complexities . Indeed , if , like me , you 're a pathetic Anglophone , then much of the Internet listening experience is about the rise and fall of the British Empire . Except that on radio it never really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee paid by every Brit who owns a TV , remains the dominant English voice , carrying a staggering quantity of programming . The best of America 's National Public Radio programs are as good as anything on the Beeb , but the sheer volume of stuff pouring out of London certainly seems to dwarf our public-radio output . And most of it 's endlessly better than the dry news and ceaseless cricket scores on the BBC 's World Service , which is all that American listeners usually hear of British radio . In fact , an Internet radio is worth the money if all you do is preset the first five buttons to the BBC flagships : Radio 2 , for instance , the most-listened-to station in the British Isles , plays jazz and pop music and light comedy and the occasional organ concert . Or BBC 7 , established a few years ago mostly to air the system 's endless archives ; at any given moment , Doctor Who might be on the air , or episode 51 ( " Life Under the Tudors " ) of the 240-chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goon Show . It also carries hours of daily children 's radio , not to mention original stand-up comedy . Best of all is BBC Radio 4 . It 's the talk channel , but there 's not much American-style **30;3088;TOOLONG chatter . Instead , it 's the aural equivalent of the Encyclopaedia Britannica , with documentaries on " The Greenspan Years , " or " Boris Yeltsin : A Flawed Giant , " or " Peak Nestwatch , " a nature group that campaigns against , among other things , " serial egg collectors " who shoot birds of prey . You might hear The Food Programme chronicling the vegetarian roots of Jainism , or an actor reading Orwell 's Down and Out in Paris and London , or another actor performing the winning story in the National Short Story contest . There 's also The Archers , believed to be the longest-running radio soap in the world , each episode of which lasts a quite reasonable 15 minutes . Until it went off the air in May , my favorite BBC Radio 4 show was A World in Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each week on a theme . One week , for instance , it was Zimbabwe 's travails : I listened to a clip from the state-run Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation , but also ones from the community radio station in Bulawayo ( a station that 's been denied a license by the government , so it exists only on cassettes and CDs passed hand to hand ) , and from the Voice of America broadcasts into Zimbabwe ( jammed by the state ) , and from the talk shows on Cape Town radio that have turned into a forum on Robert Mugabe 's tyranny . A World in Your Ear made clear that the real glory of Internet radio lies not in the polished programs of the BBC , delightful though they are-instead , it lies in the ability to eavesdrop on local discussions , to hear the world in its various moods and timbres . For most of the 20th century , listeners tried to do this with shortwave radio , but it was difficult , and not just because of the hissing static . Shortwave stations have generally been government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world-they have been remarkably alike in their somber ( and untrustworthy ) approach . But radio , at its best , is the most gloriously local of all media , hemmed in by the nearest range of hills , signals fading 10 miles out of town . We 've forgotten much of this in the United States , where deregulation in recent years has allowed a few big players ( Clear Channel , Infinity ) to buy up thousands of stations and turn them , essentially , into repeaters for their cheap-as-possible broadcasts . It 's impossible to overstate the awfulness of most of this radio . ( And to say that Americans have chosen to listen to it is simply not true-when licenses become available , these deregulated giants have the cash to make the best offers , and then their efficiencies of scale force out the remaining competition . There are whole communities whose dial is nothing but that endless round of homogenized music and bellicose talk . ) Which is why it 's so nice to be able to easily listen to what real American radio remains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meaning that the great talk shows on dozens of stations-KUOW ( Seattle ) , KPCC ( Los Angeles ) , KQED ( San Francisco ) , WBUR and WGBH ( Boston ) , WNYC ( guess ) - are always in range . You can listen to famous music programs , like Morning Becomes Eclectic from KCRW ( Santa Monica ) , but also to dozens unknown outside their home regions . I have no idea why the best early-rock-and-roll show and the best two hours of world beat pour out of public station NCPR in the far-northern New York town of Canton , but they do-Wednesdays and Fridays , three to five in the afternoon . Almost every college station in the country streams its signal , too , which means you can get one of the nicer perks of , say , a Harvard education : Every spring and winter during exam period , Harvard 's WHRB airs music " orgies " -round-the-clock exhaustive stretches of everyone from Beethoven to Keith Fullerton Whitman , whose " hyper-programmed rhythms and concrete sounds , bleeding freakout guitar , Beach Boys-style sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimalism , early mainframe computer music , fluxus-lineage borderline nonsense , complete and utter chaos , doomy chamber pop , and quiet melancholy " ( that 's Whitman 's own description of his music ) played for 32 hours over the course of a few days one spring . Compared with all this splendor , satellite radio is exposed for what it really is : a glorified airline entertainment system-hundreds of channels signifying next to nothing . Signifying next to nothing because satellite comes from nowhere . Just like the Clear Channel stations , it surrenders the thing that makes radio so magical : connection to a community . As a rough rule of thumb , the smaller the community at which a signal is aimed , the more interesting the radio-it scales down better than it scales up . Unlike television , which looks amateurish until you 've spent large sums of money and so must always aim for a large audience to cover its costs , radio allows anyone with talent and access to a transmitter to create compelling programs for practically nothing . And it gets more compelling-more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. Kitts and Nevis in the Caribbean , with Sugar Bowl spinning records in the morning and Ronnie Rascal in the afternoon , manages to conjure up that place effortlessly . A few hours of listening and you feel like you 've wandered onto the islands , that you have some sense of the country 's mores and rhythms , not to mention its economy , since the station broadcasts a series called Ready to Welcome the World , which aims to teach locals how to offer " world-class service " to vacationers . Radio is mental travel . Listening to Sirius , even the world-music shows , is like traveling to Club Med . You are n't going to be disappointed or upset-but you are n't going to be excited or entertained , either . It 's just like home , except someplace else . Tuning around the localradio dial is more like staying in an endless string of bed-and-breakfasts , the kind with talkative hosts . Sometimes it 's boring , but boring in an interesting way . One of my favorite stations , for instance , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It programs lots of Native American music and news , and lots of other music you hear almost nowhere else . ( Check out At Risk Radio on Friday nights for one of the few programs that can slide straight from Conlon Nancarrow and his playerpiano studies into Guy Klucevscek and the " Ping Pong Polka . " ) But once a year , it also offers live round-the-clock coverage of the area 's great sporting event , the Birkebeiner 51-kilometer ski race , which draws upward of 9,000 Nordic racers . Hundreds of them get interviewed as they cross the finish line , and the endless parade of flat midwestern voices ( " Yep , good race , nice course . We 'll come back next year " ) locates the place with novelistic precision . If you 're looking for a vacation to a place without cynicism , WOJB is for you . If you 're eager to wallow in some sonic vice , tune in to William Hill Radio , usually geared to the betting shops of the same name across the United Kingdom-its the only place I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greyhound racing . If you want to time-travel back to the politics of a less hard-edged day , try KBOO in Portland , Oregon , or KPFA in Berkeley . Sometimes , when all I want is sound , I 'll turn on Oman FM , for what I think is Koranic chanting-and what I know is simply otherworldly beautiful . Internet radio has its challenges , of course . Some are technical ( stations that refuse to boot up ; college stations , predictably , have the best Web connections ) , and some are political ( the recording industry , in its ongoing effort to alienate every possible customer , keeps trying to get Internet stations to pay more than terrestrial radio for the right to broadcast songs , perennially threatening to take them off the air ) . And I do n't listen to it all the time . Since I live in a particular place myself , I do listen to the few stations-public , community , college , and even one commercial-that still cover my locale and keep me in touch with my neighbors , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer sun wears me down , and I switch on the CBC Yellowknife service , just to listen to the cool temperatures of the Arctic . The last time I tuned in , someone was reading an obit for a tribal elder who had died the day before , a man who had spent the last decades of his life leading school trips into the wilderness , acquainting local youth with places he 'd always known . " It was n't unusual for him to tell the same story every night around the campfire , " said one friend . " But always in a different way , so that you got a kick out of it every time .
