Section : FEATURES <p> Distance learning has been found to be effective for continuing public health training . The authors undertook a six-week pilot to teach skills in outbreak investigation through the combination of a self-instructional , interactive , computer-based case study and online discussions led by two instructors . Participants were public health practitioners with knowledge of basic epidemiology and public health . Eighteen public health practitioners participated . Overall , participants posted 113 messages to the online discussions , with a median of 5.5 messages per participant ( range : 0-16 ) . The number of postings was higher for participants who had taken pan in an outbreak investigation before the pilot test than for those who had not . In general , participants enjoyed the experience and believed that the online discussions added value to the self-instructional case study . The authors conclude that the combination of the case study and the online discussions was a positive learning experience . They encourage others to consider this format for training . Introduction <p> Training and retraining of the estimated 450,000 U.S. public health employees ( Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , and federal level are challenging tasks . The wide variability in student background ( i.e. , education and professional experiences ) , the recurring need for training because of staff turnover , and the lack of time and resources increase the difficulty of providing training that is relevant , practical , and cost-effective . <p> Distance learning , in which the instructor and student are separated by time , location , or both , has been promoted as an effective tool for training the public health workforce . Involving approaches such as print-based materials , computer- or Web-based courses , or videotapes , distance learning can be designed so that students can fit the instruction into their schedules at their convenience . It can be designed to allow students to progress at their own rates , skip over topics they already know ( or do not need to know ) , or repeat topics with which they have difficulty . In addition , distance learning can provide the same information and training simultaneously to geographically dispersed audiences and repetitively over lime so that a reasonable level of consistency can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however . Some distance learning can seem remote and impersonal to the student , particularly when limited or no human contact is provided by an instructor or other students ( Moore , 1989 ) . Opportunities for the student to apply the training material to his or her specific work situation can be lacking , and this circumstance may hinder the student 's assimilation of the material . Furthermore , some formats of distance learning lack spontaneity and the ability to redirect training according to student needs as the training evolves . For example , in a simultaneous nationwide satellite broadcast , the instructor has limited capabilities for changing the flow of the training during the event , and students , for the most part , have no way to indicate that a change in the flow is needed . <p> The " Botulism in Argentina " computer-based case study was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) as a distance-learning approach to teach public health workers knowledge and skills needed to conduct an outbreak investigation . " Botulism in Argentina " is an interactive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbreak investigation . Initial evaluations of " Botulism in Argentina " suggest that it is effective in teaching knowledge and skills needed in outbreak investigation and could be a model for other training efforts ( Stehr-Green &; Gathany , 2002 ) . As a self-instructional course , however , the case study lacks benefits that result from student-instructor and student-student interactions . <p> CDC conducted a pilot in which the " Botulism in Argentina " computer-based case study was supplemented by an online discussion group to address the lack of human interactivity in the self-instructional format . The goal of the pilot was to determine the feasibility of conducting online discussions with public health employees ; considerations included ease of use , student/instructor satisfaction , and resource requirements . Methods <p> Participants for the discussion group were selected from members of the target audience for the " Botulism in Argentina " computer-based case study ( i.e. , public health practitioners with knowledge of basic epidemiologic and public health concepts who wanted to learn useful skills in investigating outbreaks ) . Participants were recruited through the membership of the National Environmental Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ad posted on NEHA 's Web site . Background information ( e.g. , demographics , education , and work experience ) was collected from all participants before the online discussion was initiated . <p> Two instructors ( i.e. , an epidemiologist and an instructional designer ) facilitated the discussion , which was divided into six steps ( to correspond to the steps of the case study ) . They developed a syllabus outlining the cutoff dates for discussions for each step of the case study , posted thought-provoking questions and assignments for each step , summarized participant postings on selected topics , and tried to maintain participant interest through intermittent e-mail reminders . Two expert consultants were available to address questions raised by participants regarding the practice of environmental health . <p> The online discussions were conducted through the Case Study Forum established for this project with WebBoard ( Version 4.2 ) Web discussion forum and conferencing software located on a CDC server . The WebBoard allows participants to communicate with each other on the Internet in an asynchronous manner by posting e-mail-like messages . Participants can access the online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any computer with Internet access . <p> Shortly before initiation of online discussions , participants downloaded the " Botulism in Argentina " computer-based case study and installed it on their computers . Participants received written instructions on how to access and submit comments/questions to the online discussion and the discussion syllabus . To officially kick off discussions , an audio conference was held so that participants could introduce themselves and ask questions about the pilot test . Outcome Measures <p> The authors measured participation rates by counting postings to the online discussion and summarized them by participant and for the entire group . To determine the timeliness of the postings , the date of each posting was also compared with the cutoff date for the step noted in the syllabus . Level of participation for participants with different characteristics ( e.g. , age , gender ) was compared . Participant satisfaction was evaluated after the online discussions were completed . Participants were asked to complete a survey in which they rated their level of agreement ( on a scale of 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree ) with a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also asked to describe specific problems they had had with the online discussion . Results Description of Participants <p> Eighteen target audience members from across the United States agreed to participate in the pilot test ( Figure 1 ) . Eleven participants ( 61 percent ) were male ; the median age was 36 years ( range : 22-53 years ) . Most participants ( 66 percent ) were environmental health specialists , sanitarians , or food safety inspectors . Participants had a median of 4.5 years of experience in public health ( range : 1-33 years ) . All but three participants considered themselves to have " average " computer skills . Two considered themselves beginners and one an expert . All participants had used e-mail , 10 ( 56 percent ) had participated in a listserv , and five ( 28 percent ) had participated in a Web-based discussion group . Level of Participation <p> The audioconference was held on April 23 , 2003 , and was joined by 11 participants and both instructors . The online discussion occurred from April 28 through June 8 , 2003 . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one message to the online discussion . Of the two who posted no messages , one reported that she had been misinformed about the course content and had decided not to participate . The other could not be reached . <p> Overall , 166 messages were posted during the six weeks of the pilot test ; 113 ( 68 percent ) of the messages were posted by participants . Most of the participant postings were responses to questions or assignments made by the instructors ; about one-quarter of their postings specifically referred to a posting by another participant ( e.g. , responded to questions from another participant , added to or supported the thoughts of others ) or initiated a new thought or discussion thread . Content of the postings frequently referred to the participant 's own professional or personal experiences . <p> The median number of messages posted per participant was 5.5 ( range : 0-16 ) . The number of messages posted per participant did not differ by gender , age , years of public health experience , or previous participation in a listserv or discussion group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had previously participated in investigating an outbreak ( median : 7.5 postings ) than for those who had not participated in an outbreak investigation ( median : 4.0 postings ) ( p = .08 ) . <p> The number of messages posted decreased as the pilot progressed . The highest number of messages ( 58 ) was posted for Step 1 of the case study . The lowest number was for Step 5 ( 12 messages ) ( Figure 2 ) . The posting of messages for each step of the case study followed the discussion syllabus only loosely . Over one-third of the postings for particular steps occurred after the cutoff date as noted in the syllabus . Evaluation of Experience <p> Seventeen ( 94 percent ) participants submitted an evaluation of the online discussions . On a set of standardized statements , the participants were positive about the learning experience ( Table 1 ) . In general , participants believed that the online discussion added value to their learning experience , which otherwise would have been self-instruction only . All participants enjoyed reading other participants ' postings and thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not considered . A number of participants said that they were initially uncomfortable posting their ideas online but that these feelings changed as the discussions progressed . Several participants described technical difficulties accessing the online discussions and posting messages . One participant reported difficulty viewing the list of postings and seeing which ones had already been read . One participant ( and one consultant ) reported that messages they posted had been lost ( probably because they did not " post " them before signing off the system ) . Discussion <p> Although the authors did not evaluate whether individuals who participated in the online discussion of the " Botulism in Argentina " computer-based case study learned more than do individuals who complete the case study on their own , the findings suggest that the combination of the case study and online discussion was a positive experience overall . First , there was a high level of participation by most members of the discussion group ; participants appeared to be reading the postings of their colleagues and independently posed questions to the group or sought guidance from other participants . Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the discussions , often referring to the participants personal experiences with regard to the subject under discussion . Third , almost every aspect of the learning experience was rated highly by participants in the satisfaction survey , and all but three participants ( 18 percent ) said that they would participate in a similar undertaking in the future . Finally , the discussions clearly supplied the human interactivity ( student-instructor and student-student ) missing from the self-instructional case study . As evidenced by selected statements quoted below , the participants enjoyed these interactions : " I had no idea that I would have access to all this input from other sanitarians across the country . The mixture of less experienced and very experienced participants was very helpful , also the mix of sanitarians and epidemiologists . I wish the same group could do more exercises together . " " The discussion met my expectations . I expected to see a different answer from every person for every question . This definitely happened ! " " I definitely did not feel alone , more like a team going through the investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gentle Socratic ' push ' given by the instructors . " " The role of the moderators ca n't be overstated , and the job done by the moderators was superb . " <p> The online discussion seemed more successful than those reported in the literature for health care providers , a group seemingly similar to these pilot participants ( Chan , Leclair , &; Kaczorowski , 1999 ; Sargeant et al. , 2000 ) . Why was this ? The authors believe it was largely due to the characteristics of the participants and the self-selection involved in the identification of the discussion group . Research suggests that students who are voluntary students , motivated with higher expectations , older , and more serious in their studies tend to be more successful in online discussions ( Palloff &; Pratt , 1999 ) . These characteristics easily fit the discussion group of young and middle-aged adults who volunteered for this pilot because they wanted to learn skills that were relevant to their job performance . <p> The computer-based case study ( as the focus of the discussions ) probably also contributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has an engaging interface and the feel of a simulation , seems to draw the student in ( Gathany &; Stehr-Green , 2003 ) . Students seem motivated to complete the case study and are interested in talking with others about the concepts raised . <p> The nature of the discussions , no doubt , also played a part in the success . Palloff and Pratt posed six elements as critical to the success of online learning : I ) a sense of safety and trust , 2 ) responsiveness from instructors and other participants , 3 ) relevance and ability to relate the subject matter to professional and life experiences , 4 ) respect between participants as people , 5 ) openness and an ability to freely share thoughts , and 6 ) empowerment to impact the training experience ( Palloff &; Pratt , 1999 ) . The online discussion in this study fulfilled many of these elements . Participants were courteous , supportive , and respectful of each other . The instructors made a concerted effort to respond to postings by individuals , and clearly the participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided many opportunities for the student to apply the concepts addressed in the computer-based case study to his or her specific work situation , and participants frequently referred to their own work experiences and made generalizations from those experiences . The online discussion also was flexible , so the training provided in the computer-based case study could be supplemented to meet the current needs of the participants . <p> There were problems with the online discussions , however : The Web conferencing software ( Web-Board , Version 4.2 ) used for the online discussions was cumbersome . Although somewhat intuitive for individuals who had participated in online discussions before , the software had idiosyncrasies that were difficult to overcome . For example , participants could not view the titles of all of the posted messages on entering the system , but needed to expand selected " discussions " individually . Therefore , participants had to work to see which messages were new or of interest . In addition , the marking of messages as read ( somewhat dependent on the account settings of the individual participant ) was not specific to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were automatically marked as read if the participant logged off , whether or not they had been read . Some participants reported difficulty accessing the discussions and posting messages , and some even lost messages they had composed . It is likely that all of these problems led to participant frustration , decreased comprehension of the information , and caused the loss of contributions to the discussions . Therefore , the authors agree with other online-discussion organizers that software that can be easily used by participants who lack computer proficiency or comfort with computers is needed to enhance the experience for all participants ( Palloff &; Pratt , 1999 ; Sargeant , et al. , 2000 ) . A few participants ( and the instructors , at times ) were overwhelmed by the discussions and the extensive comments made by others . Given the lengthy period over which discussions occurred , the number of new postings each week , and the fact that participants moved through the case study at different paces , there was the potential for participants to lose the thread of the ongoing discussions . This problem would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly and review messages more frequently . Shortening the discussion period , adhering to the syllabus , and decreasing the number of participants might lessen this problem , as participants would move more in concert . These changes , however , could negatively affect the quality of the discussions as well as increase the per-student cost for the instruction . Maintenance of adequate levels of participation was a looming concern . The instructors tried to promote participation by sending e-mail reminders , making specific assignments , and posting controversial messages meant to evoke responses ; nonetheless , postings fell over time . Although this result is understandable given the busy work and personal schedules of participants , it is unfortunate . Award of a certificate or continuing-education credits tied to a requirement for a certain level of participation might increase participation , but it also might negatively affect the nature of the discussions and the general " feel " of the group interactions . <p> Resources used to conduct the online discussions can only be estimated . They include conferencing software . Web support , server access , audio call costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well over 15 hours enrolling participants , setting up participant accounts to access the online discussions , and developing the course structure . They spent an additional 35 to 40 hours reviewing postings to the online discussion , responding to messages when appropriate , summarizing postings from selected topics , and following up on individual participants who had expressed a need for help on a particular topic . The participant time commitment is unknown , but , based on accounts from two active participants , may have reached as high as 20-25 hours ( including three to four hours to complete the case study itself ) . Therefore , the authors estimate that the time required for this course was similar to that necessary for a one-week on-site course . If an on-site course had been undertaken , however , travel time and costs would have been incurred . Furthermore , the online formal allowed participants to continue their normal work and provided flexibility in the timing of their participation . As one participant put it : " With my schedule , it was great to be able to move in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any length of time . " Conclusion <p> In summary , the online discussion of the " Botulism in Argentina " computer-based case study was a positive experience for participants and instructors . It appears to be an enjoyable and economical way to receive training and to make contact with other professional colleagues . The authors encourage others to consider this approach for their public health training needs . They suggest , however , that close attention be paid to the problems identified in this pilot as well as to those that may be unique to the students being trained . <p> Acknowledgments : The authors would like to thank Stuart Capper for his advice about online discussions .
