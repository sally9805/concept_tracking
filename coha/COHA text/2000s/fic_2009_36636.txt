In the rare event that one man must follow two others without being observed , follow them closely from first light to summer dusk , certain conditions are best met . Those being followed should stand out vividly from the world passing around them ; he who follows , of course , should not . And the following itself should occur in the thick of a crowd as alien and uncaring as is practicable . <p> All of which is to say that conditions today are very near the ideal . <p> Having shaken off its morning torpor , Fleet Street has moved without interval into the irritability of early afternoon . Carters jostle peddlers , and servants swarm the lane between shop windows and the row of posts protecting them from the street . Everyone seems to be wrestling some greasy package home , or if not , then envying his neighbor 's . A coach comes rocking out of Hen-and-Chicken Court and drives straight at the crowd , only to have the ranks suddenly part and reform , swallowing it whole . Sullen chairmen jog by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their ankles only at the last instant , and neither party seems aware of the interaction , or lack thereof . All is one general fabric of gray and brown discontent , no particle detachable from the whole . <p> Until I spot the two of them , coming along in the distance . <p> They are framed momentarily by the thick stone arch of Temple Bar , and the effect is uncanny , like the first seconds of a magic lantern show , when the pretty pictures suddenly begin to crawl in the candlelight . It is not just the movement that strikes one , but the meaning . For once the painted emblems have started into motion , there is a palpable significance , a meaning , an inevitability to their progress . One understands intuitively that the images will not stop until the catastrophe . And therein lies the viewer 's chief satisfaction . <p> Of course in this case , given that the plot and the catastrophe are of my own composition , my satisfaction in watching the pair advance is at least doubled . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Temple arch , though , once their movements are no longer properly framed , they are simply two gentlemen again , picking their way along down Fleet . But two gentlemen such as the City has never seen before and will never see again . There is no mistaking them for anyone else , you may take my word . Especially with the larger , older , and testier of the two so very much larger and older and testier . Even plagued as he is by phantom pains in his back and his legs , Samuel Johnson bulls forward through the Saturday morning crowd , not walking his oaken stick but brandishing it . <p> He is fifty-four years of age , a large-boned , large-nosed , large-eyed , big-bellied man , and the smaller and less determined catch sight of him at the last second and scatter as he comes . Here is what they see bearing down on them just before they jump : the vast body is packed into a rusty brown suit of clothes , waistcoat creaking at the buttons , flashing the dull white shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes rarely wiped and currently spattered , silver buckles half the size of the prevailing fashion because small buckles are at once conservative and cheap . A small unpowdered wig , brown and shriveled , rides the head like a mahout . <p> Johnson 's mood seems cheerful enough this morning , for Johnson , and he carries this good humor truculently along with him as he comes . <p> The younger man striding brilliantly alongside seems small only by way of comparison . In his own right he is brutishly healthy , leaning but never quite toppling to fat . Of just under middling height , maybe five feet six inches all told . The complexion is dark by City standards , but tinged with rose at his neck and plump cheeks . And he is radiantly happy , anyone can perceive this , no matter the distance . <p> The importance of the day 's outing to the younger man shows in every considered detail of his appearance : he is wearing his own hair , but meticulously dressed , powdered , and tied back with sober black silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he has affected rather than earned ; and a smart , silver-hilted , five-guinea blade got by hoaxing Mr. Jefferys , sword-cutter to His Majesty . He wears his genteel new violet frock suit , with its matching violet button , as though it were a coronation outfit . And his shoes have been wiped to within an inch of their lives . This is James Boswell , age twenty-two . <p> And what makes you simply want to murder the pair of them , more than anything else , is the perfectly ludicrous way they seem to complete one another . Not quite opposites , but different in a thousand complementary ways . Two odd human fractions who have stumbled somehow onto the secret of the whole number . <p> It is this sense of completion that draws heads around as they saunter down Fleet , not the barking volume of their talk , which is high enough , of course . And it is this wholeness that brings the occasional snicker , from the coal-heavers and the milk-women and the bankers . Those doing the snickering tell themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mismatched pair in all their lives , sweet Jesus , but this is a thin attempt at self-comfort . If , rather than matched , these two men are mismatched , then north is south , hot cold , and our own lots in life momentarily less meager . <p> The truth is easier to see , but a great deal harder to recognize , and to accept : these two men have one another suddenly , and do n't seem much to need anybody else . Their friendship of two months could not be any more clearly destined to last two lifetimes . <p> The sight of them suggests a completion we all seek in our friendships , our whole lives long , and do not find ; at a deeper , blacker level , it is what we seek from the cradle each inside ourselves , and never discover . We are fragments scattered about loose in the world , yet in some way now these two men are not , not any longer . <p> What can all the rest of us do , then , but point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's delight at walking down Fleet Street with his hero lends him an almost visible shimmer . Just as evident , though , is his anxiety that some small thing may unexpectedly cloud the skies of Johnson 's amiability . Even in his joy he is continually scanning the older man 's face for weather signs . <p> Oh , this James is solicitous , and for this too you could murder him . <p> But after all , currying favor is James 's explicit purpose for coming up to London in the first place . Somehow he has secured permission to spend the bulk of this year begging a commission in the King 's Guard from those who would vastly prefer not to give it him . And to that official errand James has added another entirely his own : to worm his way into the hearts and affections and appointment books of as many full-scale London authors and notables as he can manage in the space of nine months . <p> It took six of those months merely to make the acquaintance of Johnson , author of the Dictionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But having done so , James has wasted no time parlaying the acquaintance into a friendship , and that friendship into something now just shy of actual foster-fatherhood . <p> This morning , he showed up on Johnson 's Inner Temple doorstep at just a touch past nine-thirty for their ten o'clock meeting , so afraid was he of being thought less than punctual . He stood for a moment , pondering . Lifted his fist to knock , dropped it without knocking . Then , lest he seem overeager and boyish , James strolled around the corner , looking to kill time , looking for amusement . <p> I stood and watched him all the while he stood and watched Fleet Street . <p> He settled his attention on the Temple Bar , as well he might : set into cornices of the stone arch are statues of Charles I , the Stuart martyr , and Charles II , whose itch for actresses brought women to the English stage . And something else : on iron pikes atop the stone pediment sit two now-desiccated heads . For reasons that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the terrifying jolt of a good hanging or dismemberment ; these two skulls , circled by flies and touched with the gore of history , seize and hold his attention . <p> He is predictable , is James . <p> A sharp little shopkeeper hard by the Bar sized up the situation and trotted out with a cheap pair of spyglasses , half-penny the look , and James delightedly fished in his pocket for change . Then , after having his sleeve pulled twice , and paying cheerfully for two more long looks , James simply struck a bargain to buy the glasses outright . <p> After another ten minutes , when he had finished searching the desiccated heads for meaning , for sensations , he dropped the glasses into his deep coat pocket and retraced his steps to #1 Inner Temple Lane . <p> I followed after a moment , marveling at the endless seepage of unforeseeable detail into even the tightest plans , the capillary action of disaster . Who but the Lord Himself could have foreseen that James would suddenly acquire the ability to see great distances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on the river every bit as casually as he might search his own waistcoat pockets ? <p> Not for the first time , I wondered if the Lord might be plotting against me , somehow , and I added the spyglasses to Johnson 's stick and James 's sword , the small running mental list of objects to which I must pay particularly close attention this day . <p> So here it is now , just before noon , and they have had their late-late-morning coffee at Child 's , and a separate dish of chocolate for James . They have sauntered for a good twenty minutes under the leafy trees of Hare Court , tuning up their voices and their respective pomposities . And now they 're off for their true lark of the day-a float down the eastern stretch of the Thames . <p> But of course this is Dictionary Johnson , who birthed the entire sanctioned English lexicon from his own singularly overstuffed vocabulary , and so a fl oat down the river can not remain merely a fl oat . God forbid . <p> A riverine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so altogether grand that I have decided to take a riverine excursion of my own . <p> They come down Middle-Temple Lane , a moist wind filling their noses , and there , in the dark frame created by the Harcourt Buildings , lies the silver water of the Thames . They lift their well-fed faces at the pleasant shock of the river : the glittering length of it just behind a line of unremarkable city roofs , coiling through the city with all the drowsy power of a boa constrictor . And on it , every device for flotation known to mankind , moving everywhere and at every speed at once : wherries and barges , sloops and fish-smacks , skiffs and cheap wooden bottoms and the occasional grand racing yacht , twelve oarsmen pulling all at once . Gulls crash and tilt and screech overhead , and the stink of fish and water rot comes up sharp with the wind . <p> As the two men approach the Temple Stairs , and the loafing watermen sense the approach of custom , a predictable form of hell breaks loose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone because they all have the menial 's highly developed nose for power . <p> Westward or Eastward , Sir ! Row you straight , row you quiet ! <p> Sculler ! Sculler , maybe , gents ? Sculler ! <p> He 'll drown you , that one ! Do n't be daft , Sir . Oars here now ! <p> For all their crowding and jostling , the watermen observe a thin protective bubble around their marks , pawing the air but never once putting a hand to Johnson 's coat . And he points without hesitation to a young man about fifteen years old , standing off to one side , and barks , " Take us out then , boy , " and the crowd of rivermen explodes in curses and righteous indignation . <p> The boy leads them quickly down the center stair to the river . He is wearing the arms of the King on his uniform , and no doubt this is part of the reason Johnson chose him . Johnson has a pension of 300 a year from the King , and I imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Johnson not only the great and benevolent power of the Crown , but the great and benevolent power of Sam Johnson . And , too , the King 's men are watched more carefully by the Crown , and so they are less likely to cheat you , more likely to get you there clean and dry . Not much less , and not much more , but a bit . <p> After some fiddling , the boy draws his narrow red sculler up flush to the step , and Johnson climbs ponderously aboard . The long craft bobbles and then steadies . When Johnson is seated in the center , James steps relatively lightly into the rear , checks his seat for water , finds none , and sits . <p> And as they draw away , holding their hats-James 's violet suit shrinking slowly to the size of an orchid-one of the bigger watermen on the stair breaks off shouting curses at the boy piloting the sculler , turns abruptly toward the spot where I 'm standing , and crooks his finger at me . <p> The big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweat stands from the tough brown skin as he hauls his oars . He is forty-five maybe , or fifty . He wears the arms of the Lord Mayor , a looser and less appetizing outfit than the King 's . A pile of smooth river rocks stands in the bilge wash beside his own seat , just to one side of his boot , within easy reach . He is a very strong man , outfitted with the several weapons natural to his trade , and he pulls the oars with just this awareness in his air . <p> It 's the Lord Mayor 's men that dominate the movement of stolen merchandise on the river , and in the back of the sculler , behind my seat , I can see a nasty set of long gaffs and hooks , these for retrieving goods thrown from ships , these for cadging fish from passing smacks when traffic is tight . And , no doubt , for the occasional pitched battle between boats , battles for which guns are too loud and knives too short . Lord Mayor 's men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sovereign entity unto itself . <p> Johnson and James are a short ways ahead of us , gliding along near the center of the river . Traffic moves quicker there , and the view is more pleasant . The wind is a caress , not the cuff you get peering south from the Temple . The ride is smoother as well ; no need to row around wharves and stagnant debris and docks and moored vessels , as you do continually nearer the banks . As my sculler is doing at the moment . <p> " What do you want with ' em ? " the waterman says suddenly . <p> " I beg your pardon ? " <p> " What d' you want with the folk we 're pacin ' is what I mean , sir . " <p> I say nothing . <p> He keeps his head down , eyes on the mucky bit of bilge rolling back and forth across the little hull . He could look back into the shade under the thin green woolen canopy , but he does not . He does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk the shilling I have promised him . When I offered him three times the standard fare , as long as he would shadow another boat , keep mum , and take my lead on the water , the waterman did n't bat an eye . " Glad to be of service , sir , " he had said , pumped full of sudden courtesy . <p> But now he can not leave it alone . <p> " Nothing but curious , sir , " he drawls . " A man likes to know why he goes where , do n't he ? " He scratches at his leg , then the slick crown of his scalp . A pair of rowers passing the other way yell a sudden , friendly volley of obscenities at him , but he shows no sign of hearing or recognition . He continues to pull the oars and to watch the roll of bilge water . " For a jest or to come at a shilling , is why people usually follow people , " he continues . " Or to catch a girl 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple ways of it . " <p> I have my eyes on the river . <p> The waterman is jovial now , enjoying the sound of his own voice in the open air , and the anger gathers slowly in my chest , not for the first time this morning . I can feel it stirring abruptly inside me , the anger , a large dog awakened by a small noise . <p> He clucks his tongue . " Your clothes are too swell for a footpad , my fine friend . There ai n't no lady in the sculler there to follow . And you do n't strike me as bein ' in a joking mood , you do n't mind me saying . " He spits over the gunwale . " And so I 'm curious , now , nothing but that . A hint of why we 're running behind these two ? I 'll be close as the grave , trust me , sir . " <p> Again , I say nothing for a moment , and then reach into my pocket and bring up a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant . And then I pitch them over the side and into the water . Almost immediately , a young mudlark near the boat dives to catch the coins before they can touch silt . " Your fare is tuppence lighter , man , " I say . " The full shilling was for quiet , and following my instructions . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
