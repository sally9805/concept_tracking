<p>  --  Haloti Ngata 's family and friends , nearly 100 strong , surrounded him on the day his future came into focus . The Baltimore Ravens had just made the 6-foot-4 , 340-pound defensive tackle the 12th overall pick of the NFL draft . <p> It was the happiest and saddest of days ; Ngata 's dream came true , but the two people who helped him nurture it  --  his father , Solomone , and his mother , Olga  --  were n't there to celebrate . When Ngata steps onto the field during the Ravens ' season opener on Sept. 10 in Tampa , it will be the first time he has seen an NFL game in person . It also will be the first time he will play football without one of his parents watching . <p> " Being a professional , you kind of carry your life in a professional way ; being mature , not letting things bring you down , " Ngata said two weeks ago during a break from training camp at McDaniel College . " That 's what great football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adversity and still become great players . " <p> The Ravens are hoping Ngata becomes the latest in their line of marquee defensive players ; they thought so highly of him that they traded up one spot in the draft in order to grab him , and they have penciled him as a starter . His combination of size ( most notably his strong , thick legs ) and athleticism ( he was a standout rugby player ) has impressed the coaches . <p> If Ngata does fulfill his promise , those family and friends will have played a significant role . Ngata lost both of his parents in the last four years , but he found others for support . His uncle and namesake , Haloti Moala , and his high school coach , Larry Wilson , have become surrogate fathers . His new teammate and fellow Polynesian , offensive lineman Edwin Mulitalo , has become something of an older brother to the rookie , 22 . <p> " He 's got a very good support system behind him , " Baltimore defensive line coach Clarence Brooks said of Ngata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , people who have been with him a long time and who love him . They want the best for him . He 's an easy kid to like . " <p> Said Ngata , " I 've been blessed with great people . " <p> Ngata 's father died in December 2002 in the family 's home state of Utah when the truck he was driving slipped off an icy freeway ramp and flipped over . Nine months later , Ngata blew out his knee in the first quarter of the University of Oregon 's season-opening game against Mississippi State . <p> " That was the worst , " Ngata said of the one-two punch of losing his father and then football . " I think that 's when I hit rock bottom . " <p> Ngata considered quitting football and returning home to help support his mother , whose health had declined following Solomone 's death . But she insisted her son remain in school , and over the next two seasons , he became one of the Pacific-10 's most dominating defensive players . Oregon 's coaches kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they had no one who could block him , and he was too disruptive to the offense . <p> He decided to enter the NFL draft following an all-American junior season , mainly because he wanted to be able to take care of his mother , who entered the hospital in early January for kidney dialysis . But on Jan. 12 , six days after Ngata declared for the draft , she died of cardiac arrest . <p> Ngata , who was in Houston training for the NFL combine , returned to Salt Lake City for the funeral , and then flew back to Houston to resume training the next day . Moala , Olga 's brother , followed him a day later after receiving a teary , late-night call from Ngata and wound up staying with Ngata in Houston for a month . <p> " As difficult as his parents ' deaths were , the silver lining in the clouds was that it gave him more determination and motivation , " said Wilson , who coached Ngata at Highland High School in Salt Lake City . " He sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of what he is playing for is to honor his parents . They were so proud of him and loved football and loved watching him perform . You saw the resolve in him harden almost overnight ; you saw that determination and maturity emerge . " <p> Now the focus is on supporting his family . Ngata , who signed a five-year , $11.9 million contract on July 29 , has three brothers ( Finau , 26 , Solomone Jr. , 24 , and Vili , 20 ) and one sister ( Ame , 18 ) , and he has pledged to help them with whatever they need  --  but not necessarily with whatever they want . <p> " He 's real giving , " Vili said . <p> " With Polynesians , family is everything , " said Mulitalo , whose parents were born in American Samoa . Ngata 's parents were born in Tonga . " If we do n't have family , if we do n't know where we 're from , then why do anything ? So when we work , when we come out here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously my name , the Mulitalo name . I 'm sure he feels a great sense of responsibility for his name , for Ngata . " <p> Ngata knows the pressures and expectations that come with being a first-round draft pick . An NFL rule limits rookies to attending one minicamp while their school is in session , and because Oregon 's graduation ceremony did n't take place until June 17 , Ngata was forced to miss five weeks of offseason camp . <p> Because Ngata was n't allowed in the Ravens ' training complex , Wilson  --  who coached under Jim Fassel ( now the Ravens ' offensive coordinator ) at the University of Utah in the mid-1980s  --  went in his place . Wilson spent three days in Owings Mills in mid-May ; he sat in on every meeting , watched every practice while standing in Brooks 's shadow and met with the Ravens ' strength and conditioning coaches . <p> When Wilson went back to Salt Lake City , he structured Ngata 's workouts , scheduling specific times in the classroom , in the weight room and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a linebacker at Weber State , worked out with them . Other times it was Ngata and Wilson out on the field working on techniques . <p> " I did n't like that very much , " Wilson said with a laugh . " He beat the heck out of me in pass rush drills . " <p> Every day , Brooks sent Wilson via overnight mail a DVD that contained a video of that day 's practice in Owings Mills , along with whatever the Ravens were practicing the next day . <p> " We tried to keep him mentally up to speed , " said Brooks , who flew to Utah in late June to check on Ngata 's progress . " He 's a fantastic kid and a smart kid . He 's our number one pick , and we expect him to come in here and not be totally lost . So we had to help him . I think it worked pretty well . " <p> Ngata said the plays have been easy to pick up , thanks to the work he did with Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , as quickly as he can ; during camp , he stayed after practice for short tutoring sessions with Michael McCrary and Rob Burnett , the two defensive ends on Baltimore 's 2000 Super Bowl championship team . <p> He 's also trying to get used to his new life as a professional athlete , one living about 2,100 miles from home . <p> At one point , Wilson was going to retire from teaching , leave his wife behind in Salt Lake City and move to Baltimore to help Ngata adjust to his first year as a professional . Moala and his wife , Noah , also discussed moving to Maryland to be near Ngata . But those plans were abandoned in early May once it became apparent Ngata was ready to move to the East Coast on his own . <p> " We made those decisions right after his mother died , at a time of emotional distress , when we did n't know how Haloti would take it , " Moala said . " But since January , he 's grown up . He does n't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " All of us were being overprotective . We did n't give him enough credit . " <p> Still , Moala and his wife accompanied Ngata when he came to Baltimore for training camp . They helped him settle into his new apartment , watched his first two practices as a Raven and then flew back to Utah . They plan on being in M &T; Bank Stadium Thursday night , when Ngata expects to make his debut against the Philadelphia Eagles in a preseason game . <p> " I like this opportunity , me on my own , " Ngata said . " I can see the real world by myself . I can use all of the lessons that my uncle and my parents taught me. "
