Headnote Whom you are most attracted to reflects the biology of your brain as much as the heat of your heart . It may not have to do with us-it 's all about the kids . A SAN ANTHROPOLOGIST , I HAVE LONG BEEN CAPTIVATED BY ONE OF THE MOST striking characteristics of our species : We form enduring pair bonds . The vast majority of other mammals-some 97 percent- do not . * In my previous work I proposed that humanity has evolved three distinct but overlappingbrain systems that enable us to fall in love and form long-term emotional connections : the neural systems for the sex drive , romantic love , and attachment . We are all alike in having these three primary brain networks . In other ways , however , each of us is unique . We do n't fall in love with just anyone . We have deep and idiosyncratic preferences . Why do we fall in love with one person rather than another ? * There is much evidence that people generally fall in love with those of the same socioeconomic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same degree of intelligence and level of education , and with a similar sense of humor and grade of attractiveness . * But you can walk into a room of 40 people all from your background , with your level of education , degree of intelligence and good looks , and you do n't fall in love with all of them . " The road of love is narrow , " wrote Kabir , a 15th-century poet of India . " There is only room for one . " How do we form this preference-one that is so crucial to our reproductive future ? Among the myriad forces that sculpt our romantic choices is what I call your " love map , " an unconscious list of qualities you begin to build in childhood . Your mother 's wit and way with words ; your father 's interest in politics and tennis ; what your siblings like and hate ; the values of your friends and teachers ; what you see on television . All your childhood ( and adult ) experiences shape and reshape your template of the ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us has constructed an idiosyncratic catalog of traits , values , aptitudes , and mannerisms that appeal to us . Then , when the timing is right and we meet a person who registers on our love map , a cascade ofbrain chemicals is triggered that tells us with euphoric certainty that we have found the one . But I have come to believe that there 's more to mate choice than your childhood , your background , your values , and your degree of good looks . These variables act in tandem with a silent partner : your biology . What sparked my thinking on this was a classic study now commonly known as the sweaty T-shirt experiment . Women are unconsciously attracted to men with a different immune system ; they do it by smell . If you are attracted to someone whose immune system is different from yours , why would n't you also be attracted to those with other genetic differences ? Mates with distinctly different genetic profiles would produce more genetically varied young . It is this line of logic and investigation that I embarked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality factors that play a role in romantic attraction . Do opposites attract ? Or is similarity the elixir of love ? No consistent patterns emerge . Extroverts do n't always fall for extroverts , for example-or for introverts . With some traits , people gravitate to those who are similar ; in others , they prefer individuals who complement them . Psychologists report a temptation to throw in the towel on how personality influences partner selection . Could nature have left this essential aspect of reproduction to the whims of upbringing and social background ? I doubt it . Your choice of mate is crucial to your genetic future . Moreover , it is now believed that 50 percent of variance in personality is due to " temperament " - our predisposition to think and act in certain ways . Cross-cultural surveys , brain imaging studies , population and molecular genetics , twin studies-all suggest that the traits of temperament are universal and tied to our genetic makeup . Could temperament play a role in mate choice ? Four Neural Systems THE MOST DISCUSSED TRAITS OF temperament are the " bigfive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , extroversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism ( or anxiety ) . These traits are stable across the life cycle ; if you 're curious when young , you 're likely to be curious when older . Twin studies , as well as the universality and stability of these personality styles , point to a genetic basis . Since antiquity , poets , philosophers , and physicians have classified people into four styles of temperament . Plato called them the Artist , the Guardian , the Idealist , and the Rational . I theorize that these very broad basic styles of thinking and behaving are biologic trait clusters linked with specific constellations of genes , neurochemicals , and brain pathways , perhaps best described as genetic profiles . I hypothesize that we unconsciously gravitate to individuals with a somewhat different genetic profile-a strategy that evolved in tandem with human pair-bonding to enable our forebears to produce genetic variety in their young and raise infants with a wider array of parenting skills . How genes interact with other genes , how genes build proteins , how proteins build brain and bodily pathways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sculpts these systems at every level is wildly complex and still largely unknown . Nevertheless , current data suggest that four basic chemical systems-those for dopamine , serotonin , estrogen , and testosterone-are associated with suites of traits that echo Plato 's four temperament styles . Applying a shorthand that synthesizes much information about biology and behavior , I refer to those whose temperament reflects the dominance of dopamine as Explorers . These men and women tend to be risk taking , novelty seeking , impulsive , creative , and curious-traits associated with specific genes or pathways in the dopamine system . Those in whom serotonin pathways may be dominant I call Builders ; these men and women tend to be social , popular , cautious ( but not fearful ) , rule following , conventional , and often religious or spiritual . Those who express activity in estrogen pathways I dub Negotiators , women ( and men ) who tend to be verbally skilled , good at " reading " people 's faces , posture , gestures , and tone of voice , contextual thinkers , compassionate , nurturing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of testosterone I call Directors , men ( and women ) who are direct , decisive , focused , outwardly competitive , analytical and logical , and skilled with machines and other rule-based systems . We 're all a mix of all four types , of course ; but most people express some of these behavioral syndromes more than others . Serendipitously , I was asked by an online dating service , Chemistry.com , a subsidiary of Match.com , to apply what science knows about attraction to help build a state-of-the-art matching system for singles . The service provides an opportunity to test my theory in real life as well as the prospect of applying science to the public good . First I developed a 56-item questionnaire to measure the degree to which men and women express each behavioral syndrome . A shortened version of my test appears below . Based on the test , Chemistry.com members are assigned to one of 12 categories , reflecting primary and secondary temperament type . I am , for example , an Explorer/Negotiator , a person with greater expression of dopamine and estrogen systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so forth . So far , 1.6 million American men and women have taken the test , and I have analyzed data on the first 523,622 . Builders predominate ( 42 percent of the population ) . There are far fewer Explorers ( 8 percent ) than any other typea frequency that correlates with the distribution of a specific genetic variant in the dopamine system associated with novelty seeking and risk taking . Perhaps Builders were essential in ancestral times to stabilize community life , while Explorers were crucial only under changing ecological circumstances . Explorers gravitate to big cities , perhaps drawn to the novelty , energy , excitement , extravagance , and risk . Builders stay home and guard the heartland . To look at mate choice , I took a subset of 2,766 site members and examined their reactions to one another after a first meeting . The site asks members to report on their degree of attraction to the individual they just met . First meetings are powerful . They often set the course for the entire relationship . The data so far suggest that just about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) gravitate to these agreeable , imaginative , verbal men and women . More important to my theory , men and women of all broad temperament types ( except the Negotiator ) express more initial attraction for individuals with different , rather than similar , behavioral and cognitive profiles . Roots and Wings BUILDERS , BATHED IN SEROTONIN , APPEAR to be particularly attracted to the dopamine-rich Explorers , and vice versa . Perhaps the orderly , rule-following Builder needs the spontaneity and novelty of the Explorer , especially when rearing the young . And perhaps the Explorer gravitates to the Builder because he or she provides roots , rules , and loyalty-the gravitas an Explorer desires to help rear children . Directors favor Negotiators . Perhaps they need the Negotiator 's social and verbal skills , broad contextual perspective , flexibility , and nurturing . And although Negotiators are foremost drawn to their own kind , they are also drawn to the Director . Perhaps the direct , competitive , focused , decisive , logical , analytical , and mechanically talented Director balances out their flexible nature , another effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most effective match ? I suspect each combination has its own advantages and liabilities . Perhaps mate choice operates like a funnel . First you see a potential partner and size him or her up-physically . Too big , too little , too old , too young , too pink , too green , too messy , too neat . If they make the cut , then you talk . A bad accent , a dumb remark , a tasteless joke , a touch of arrogance , or some other idiosyncrasy may nip the budding romance . But if this stranger comes from your background , is of the right age , shares your level of intelligence and education , appears humorous and socially adept , has your values , fits within your love map , and the timing is right , you proceed . In these ways , similarity regularly reigns . Then come your needs , psychological and physical . Many exchange good looks for money or rank . We are often attracted to those who mask our flaws and accentuate our better parts . Roles are important , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ponder whether you 'd be comfortable as the wife of this college professor or the husband of that cafe singer . As you weigh the myriad social factors , I suspect that unconscious biological mechanisms are subtly pulling you toward those who complement you genetically . My investigation is just beginning . But it has already altered my view of some of our behavior . Perhaps some of our ubiquitous marital friction stems from the need to choose partners suitable for producing and raising babies-but not altogether understandable as companions . Some psychological thinking holds that women are drawn to men like their fathers and men to women like Mom , often to resolve childhood issues . Perhaps women do marry someone like Dad-but for biological reasons . As a child you may have experienced friction with him due to your different temperaments , but as an adult , with your biological reproductive mechanisms in full bloom , you find yourself attracted to the genetic qualities you lack-the same ones Dad has . There is magic to love . I doubt we will ever understand ( or harness ) all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we can help Cupid as we eavesdrop on nature 's plans . Sidebar We unconsciously gravitate to individuals with a different genetic profile , expressed in the cluster of behaviors and personality traits known as temperament Sidebar Marital friction may stem from the need to choose partners who are suitable for raising babies , but not necessarily understandable as companions .
