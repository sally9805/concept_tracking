DO N'T GET into New York City that often these days . Consequently , I 'm always overwhelmed during my visits not only by the vivid stimuli attendent on that unique urban milieu but also by the effort of maintaining a mental appointment book that includes as many visits to contacts in the publishing business - editors , agents and fellow writers - as can possibly be crammed into my unavoidably brief stay . These distractions were my only excuse for telling the Port Authority trolling cab driver who picked me up my real line of work when he asked . <p> " Science fiction writer , huh ? " Contrary to expectations , the cabbie was not a foreign-born low-rung struggler but a young , white-goateed guy , some member of the Tamagotchi generation earning a few bucks between Phish concerts . It was too late now to deny my foolish admission , so , bracing myself for the flood of snide derision that so often followed such a revelation , I replied , " Yes . just had a new novel out last year . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping to avoid the obligatory , " I never heard of you oryourbook " response . But the cabbie 's next words shocked me completely . <p> " Let me ask your expert opinion then . Do n't you think the oldfashioned plot potential of an integral Dyson Sphere has been completely superseded by the pointillistic Dyson Cloud concept ? " <p> I could n't find my tongue for about thirty seconds . When I managed to reply , I stammered , " Wuhwell , not entirely . There 's still a lot of mileage left in the older version that even Bob Shaw did n't extract . " " Who ? ? ' <p> " Bob Shaw ? The British writer <p> who died not long ago - 11 " Never heard of him . " " But I assumed you were a fan ...... The driver took a hand off the wheel to make a dismissive gesture , and we nearly ran up the business end of a garbage truck bearing the colorful urban motto , " Open wide , West Virginia ! " <p> " Nah ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Movies then ? " " Old media , dude . " " You surf the e-zines ? " <p> " Not the fiction ones . I really like the WWF site though . " My face must have registered my utter confusion . " How did you get interested in the fictional use of Dyson Spheres , then ? " <p> The insouciant driver shrugged , and we elegantly sideswiped a bike messenger . " I ca n't really say . It 's just , like , something in the air , you know . People are always talking about some topic or other . I must have overheard a conversation and started wondering . " The rest of our intermittent dialogue was unmemorable , and by the time the cabbie deposited me outside my hotel , I had managed to put aside the conundrum . Having my first-offered credit card embarrassingly declined at the check-in desk helped concentrate my mind on the grim realities of maneuvering through the unforgiving city in pursuit of my livelihood . So when the bellhop , tip in hand , hesitated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stack of my latest paperback , and then asked me , " Sir , exactly how do you portray a working nanotechnology so as to avoid rendering it indistinguishable from magic ? " I was completely flummoxed . <p> I focused on the bellhop for the first time and saw a wizened oldster , one of those New York working stiffs who seemed to have survived from a prehistoric era . I decided to adopt a friendly manner . <p> " Ah , my friend , you must be an old pulps fan ! Do you know I 've actually shaken Jack Williamson 's hand ? " <p> " Who ? " " Are n't you perhaps a member of First Fandom , conversant with science fiction from its earliest days ? " <p> " That Buck Rogers stuff ? Never touch it ! " why are you quizzing me about Clarke 's Law , then ? " <p> " I do n't know what the hell you 're talking about , mister ! I ask you a simple question and you fancy it all up ! Thanks for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise of the slamming door filling my ears , I sat on the bed and tried to make sense of what had just happened . Ten minutes later , acknowledging my utter failure to comprehend anything , I got up and had a shower . Then I went to my noontime appointment . <p> Gardner Dozois sat in his office at Asimov 's with a strange expression on his normally jolly hirsute face . Gazing abstractedly out the window , he fondled an expensive-looking chrome gadget which I mistook at first for a Star Ways prop . I clapped the editorheartily on his shoulder and made what I thought was a decent joke . <p> " Should n't you leave those toys to Scott Edelman 's Sci-Fi Entertainment magazine , Gardner ? After all , you 're running a literary sf magazine here ! " My editor swiveled around to regard me with utter solemnity . " This is n't a toy . It 's a professionalgrade chef 's mandoline . It slices vegetables in a special way . Watch . " <p> From a desk drawer he took a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heap of redolent slivers while I watched in total astonishment . <p> " That - that 's wonderful , Gardner . But I wanted to talk to you about my novella ...... <p> From beneath the pile of traumatized onion shreds , Gardner withdrew a soggy manuscript . " Is this it ? You 'd better take it back . I have n't read it yet , and I doubt I ever will . " <p> " But I submitted it six months ago ! It ca n't be that bad ! " <p> " It 's not , it 's not . But I 'm out of this whole stale business now . I 'm going to open a restaurant in Philadelphia . Chez Dozois . " " You 're abandoning your whole career , a lifetime spent in the field ? I ca n't believe what I 'm hearing ! Why not at least wait until retirement age ? Why now ? " <p> " I ca n't explain . It 's just something in the air . " <p> " I - I 'd better leave now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drawer that had supplied the onion and took out a fluffy chef 's toque . He donned it , smiled , and asked , " What do you think ? " " Beautiful . Now if I can have my story back , please - " <p> Storming out , I passed Stan Schmidt . The Burl-Ives-like editor of Analog was standing by the water cooler , strumming an acoustic guitar while the vivacious Sheila Williams sang a Peter , Paul and Mary song for an audience of coworkers . <p> Out on the sidewalk , the smell of onions from my briefcase made me start to salivate , and I zeroed in on a souvlaki vendor , resigned to forgoing my editor-sponsored lunch ( unless of course I was content to wait for the imminent opening of Chez Dozois ) . Assembling my sandwich , the vendor caught a glimpse of my Nebula nominee lapel pin . <p> " Maybe you can help settle an argument ' tween me and the wife , buddy . Do androids and other human simulacra question the epistemological basis of reality , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sandwich and fled . My next appointment was n't <p> until two . I killed time on a bench in Washington Square . During that interval , I overhead average children , teens , and adults discussing , among other topics , the practicality of governing interstellar empires , whether artificial intelligence would be achieved through topdown or bottom-up architecture , in what ways the term WATER MARGINS differed from BORDERLANDS , and whether the Wellsian dictum warning against " one oddness too many " in fantastic stories was still applicable in postmodern fabulations . <p> Dazed and bewildered , I staggered over to the Flatiron Building to meet with Gordon Van Gelder . For one brief moment I could pretend that the strange mental virus " in the air " had failed to infect the youthful editor of F &SF,; for he sat calmly , reading a magazine . But then I noticed that the stubblecheeked boyish blue-penciller was examining not his usual copy of Publishers Weekly , but rather a glossy museum catalog . Spying me , he set the catalog aside and extended his hand . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " I 've felt better . And you ? " " Just wonderful ! I have a new <p> job now . Director of the Curt Teich Postcard Archives out inWauconda , Illinois . I curate my first show next month . You 'll be getting an invitation , of course . " <p> I edged carefully toward the exit . " And my column ? " <p> " Oh , naturally you 'll have to take that up with the new editor , whoever that might be . There 's a wealth of applicants - folks you 've never heard of have come out of the woodwork-but Ed 's too busy earning his Florida real-estate broker 's license to interview them yet . However , if you can write entertainingly about postcards - 11 I knocked down a Chinese restaurant delivery-boy in my haste to clear Gordon 's offices . Helping the lad up , I was somehow not surprised to hear him exclaim , " TANSTAAFL ! " <p> The downgoing elevator opened its doors to pick up passengers , and I was startled to spot Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had stepped out of Tom Wolfe 's sartorial dreams , the grinning Nebula Banquet sponsor wore a pair of binoculars around his neck . <p> " Ca n't talk now , " Doherty blithely informed me . " I 'm off to Saratoga for the opening day of Race Week . I 've invested all of Tor 's working capital in a stable of Kentucky thoroughbreds . Bye ! " In the Tor offices , pandemonium reined , as workers hurriedly cleaned their desks and conducted phone interviews with potential new employers . I stopped Patrick Nielsen Hayden and asked despondently if perhaps he planned on remaining behind to salvage this mess . " Moi ? Au con traire . Teresa and I have been tapped as hosts for a new network morning show . Regis and Kathie Lee , watch your ratings ! " <p> My last hope was a certain silver-haired science-fictional patriarch . I stumbled into David Hartwell 's office . He was busy on the phone , but waved me to a chair . " What do you mean , they ca n't get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order weeks ago ! Well , hold their feet to the fire on it ! " <p> He slammed the phone down and turned to me . " Sorry about that . But my new line of Hawaiian shirts is slated to debut in Milan next week , and I need to make sure we can fill all the anticipated orders . As soon as the buzz starts in Women 's Wear Daily , I 'm outta this sinking ship ! " Well , I beat Hartwell out the Tor offices by a week or so . But unlike him , I had no destination other than a dark bar . After six drinks - and a desultory discussion with the bartender about firstcontact protocols - that was where the ghost found me . <p> He looked a lot like Heinlein and a little like Asimov , but there were elements of Frank Herbert in the beard , and a little Simak around the eyes . The wavery ghost said , " Do n't worry , son . It 's just our field 's version of the Negroponte Flip . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigwig at MIT . He noticed that media that were once delivered by wire had gone wireless , and vice versa . He called it the Negroponte Flip . " <p> " And you 're claiming- ? " " That all the common people , the mundanes - the mob who once knew nothing about science fiction - have become saturated with it , thanks to seventy years of exposure . Especially lately , with the new high profile of the field . The tropes are all in the air now . No one even has to read or watch the stuff anymore . It just drifts out of the noosphere straight into their heads . " " What about the professionals ? " " The high priests have burnt out . Their mental circuits are overexposed . They 're the only ones in the world now who are immune to a sense of wonder . " <p> " Well , at least we oldtimers will be famous and revered for our literary inventions . " <p> " Not really . it 's all too generic . Can you name the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed away woozily from the bar . " There 's only one thing left for me to do , then . " <p> The ghost looked nervous . " You ca n't kill yourself over this . " " Who 's going to kill himself ? <p> There 's a Starbucks franchise for sale back home that I 've had my eye on for some time now ! " ' T <p>
