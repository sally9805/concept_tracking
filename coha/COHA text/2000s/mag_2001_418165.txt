How could you explain those exotic tan lines to someone who does n't already know ? Everything goes so white above the knees and below the neck . The funny spots on the tops of my hands . I ponder the whiteness of my stomach . I 've kept it free from that Michelin tire that everyone promises will surround me now that I 'm not 18 anymore .

To Learn to Ride the Bike I could never understand why people got so worked up about bicycles . They were kids ' toys . Adults rode them because they could n't afford , or did n't believe in , cars . Or maybe they had a death wish , or awful fashion sense . I did n't get it and I did n't care . Then I took a job with a big communications firm and was transferred to The Netherlands . Everyone had a bike-grandmothers , businessmen , beautiful women I wanted to meet . It was so natural to them that I was laughed at when I questioned it . This is how I came to be pedaling for the first time in a couple of decades . This is how I got hooked . I 've been back home for five years . A co-worker moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other day .

Dave suggests a lunchtime date to ride the trails near the office-technical stuff-a challenge . So we go . It 's cold , not really cycling weather . I have n't ridden in close to a year .

I 'd crossed the double yellow stripe several times , so it did n't surprise me to hear the cop yelling , " There 's a line in the road ! " But then I realized she had n't said " line .
