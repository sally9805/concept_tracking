Section : CELL PHONES &; SERVICE REPORT &; TEST Complex pricing schemes and incompatible technologies make choosing a handset and service plan a tough call for consumers . <p> One day last July , someone somewhere in America walked into a storefront , clicked on a mouse , or dialed a toll-free number and signed up for cell-phone service . This unheralded event marked an impressive milestone : In just a decade , the cellular industry had recruited its one hundred millionth customer . <p> What accounts for this burgeoning success ? Clearly , service providers have sold peripatetic consumers on the dial-anywhere convenience of wireless telephony . Industry leaders  --  including familiar names like AT &T; Wireless and Sprint PCS , as well as newly merged entities like Verizon Wireless ( created out of Bell Atlantic , GTE , and others ) and Cingular Wireless ( comprising mainly BellSouth and SBC Wireless )  --  have stitched together nationwide networks . <p> Meanwhile , cell-phone manufacturers  --  chiefly , Audiovox , Ericsson , Kyocera ( formerly Qualcomm ) , Motorola , Nokia , and Samsung  --  are churning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a full complement of conveniences , such as voice-activated dialing , plentiful memory for frequently called numbers , caller ID , and voice mail . The newest models now come packed with high-tech options like instant messaging , e-mail access , and simple web browsing . <p> Yet despite this undeniable progress , problems that have plagued the industry from its infancy continue to burden consumers with inflated costs and frequent and frustrating service breakdowns . In selecting a service plan , for example , you still must navigate a maze of widely varying charges for calls made during " peak " and " off-peak " minutes , while " roaming " outside of your home area , and when dialing long distance . Maps that purport to show where service is available often fail to disclose " dead " spots where calls can be blocked and pockets where towers that carry cellular signals are scarce . And handset technologies that may operate on two frequency bands and in any of four incompatible digital formats further cloud consumers ' choices . Change carriers and chances are good that you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone number , to boot . <p> In short , what appears to be missing from the wireless industry 's successful formula is a key ingredient  --  reliable basic service that 's easy to understand . <p> This was borne out in a survey we conducted last fall of a nationally representative sample of 1,541 cell-phone users . We found that only about half of the respondents were completely satisfied or very satisfied with their cell-phone plan  --  among the lower satisfaction scores for consumer services we track  --  comparable to satisfaction levels for trial lawyers and airlines . One respondent in eight was dissatisfied with his or her current carrier . Investigations by state attorneys general and class-action lawsuits alleging pricing irregularities , misleading claims about coverage , or unreliable service against AT &T; Wireless , Sprint PCS , and U.S. Cellular , among others , are under way or have recently been settled . <p> Whether you 're new to the ranks of cell-phone users or are a veteran of the wireless wars wondering whether it 's time to upgrade , this report can help you make sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service plan that fits your needs and budget . ( " A Sampler of Plans , " the table on page 15 , compares offerings suited to most nonbusiness wireless users from the major national and regional carriers . ) In the section " All About Handsets , " on page 16 , we report on the evolving technology , present our test findings of 13 widely available cell phones , and explain how to select models based on features that matter most  --  how easy it is to make and receive calls , and how clear those calls sound . <p> We 'll also bring you up to speed on the latest findings on key safety questions : the radio-frequency emissions that have raised health concerns and the risks of using a cell phone while driving . That information , along with troubling questions about whether you can count on 911 emergency calls getting through , can be found in " Cellular Health and Safety Update , " page 18 . THE PLAN 'S THE THING <p> As dazzling as the technology in those sleek handsets can be , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that will absorb the bulk of your cellular budget . Indeed , the technology that the carrier you select uses to process call signals will determine which handsets you can consider . That 's why you should shop first for a plan that offers the best value for the times when you 're likeliest to call . <p> Rudimentary service . For the most basic service offered through so-called prepaid plans , you purchase calling minutes in replenishable allotments , usually at top per-minute rates . Typically , the prepaid option is used by consumers with brief or spotty credit histories who can not otherwise qualify for an annual contract , or by young people whose parents pay their bills and want to limit their calling . But this can also be one way for novice cell-phone users to try out a service and see how they use it before committing to a contract . If you choose prepaid service , however , your choice of handsets may be limited to a few no-frills models . <p> Contractual plans . Most plans today offer a prescribed number of included minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorny trade-offs . Depending upon where you live , you may find plans that range in cost from as little as $10 ( for a scant 10 minutes or so of air time per month ) up to as much as $400 ( providing a loquacious 4,000 minutes ) . Generally , the bigger the " bucket " of minutes you buy , the lower your per-minute calling cost will be  --  provided , of course , that you use most or all of your monthly allotment . <p> Extra time beyond that allowance is charged at a rate of anywhere from 25 to 65 cents per minute . Supplemental minutes often cost less in plans that come bundled with a larger monthly allowance . AT &T's; Wireless $19.99 plan , for example , includes 60 minutes of talk time per month and charges 40 cents for each additional minute . By contrast , the company 's $29.99 Regional Advantage plan includes 120 minutes of air time , with extra minutes at 30 cents apiece . <p> While the included minutes in most calling plans can be used anytime , day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of extra minutes for less busy , off-peak evening and weekend hours . For example , Sprint 's basic Free &; Clear plan includes 20 minutes of unrestricted air time for $19.99 a month . But for an additional $10 , subscribers can purchase 200 off-peak minutes . Provided you use more than 25 of those minutes per month , you would come out ahead buying the supplemental package rather than paying 39 cents for extra minutes billed a la carte . <p> Calling-area options . Further complicating the choice of a plan is the size of the area qualifying for calls to be charged at the lowest per-minute rate . The narrowest of these so-called home areas may be a city and its surrounding suburbs  --  usually a fine choice for commuters wanting to stay in touch . <p> A regional plan , by contrast , offers a more generous , multistate home-calling area , though it may come with a higher flat monthly charge ( or fewer minutes ) . For example , in the Northeast , AT &T; offers a Regional Advantage plan and a Digital Advantage plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscriber talk for 120 minutes per month throughout a multistate territory extending from Virginia to Maine . The Digital Advantage plan , by contrast , includes 250 minutes of talk time , but they can be used only within a designated metropolitan area . Beyond those boundaries , your calls will be billed at a far-higher roaming rate of 60 cents per minute . <p> The top-tier plans offer buckets of nationwide minutes at a flat monthly rate , with no restrictions on local , roaming , or long-distance calls . You can expect to pay a premium for this coast-to-coast service ; the least expensive AT &T; Digital One Rate national calling plan , for example , carries a flat monthly rate of $60 that includes 450 minutes of nationwide calling . <p> These plans also have their limitations . Preferential national rates may apply only in areas served by the carrier you select . But some service providers , such as Sprint PCS , that claim national networks leave large swaths of the map uncovered . Where coverage is n't available , you may be billed for calls at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission towers carry your signals  --  up to 69 cents a minute in the case of Sprint 's customers . COSTS ADD UP FAST <p> When you sign up for cellular service , you enter something of a time warp . That 's because no matter which provider 's plan you choose , a " minute " of cellular calling time can be as short as a few seconds , and your monthly allotment of " free " minutes can quickly disappear into a costly black hole . Here are some of the ways that cell time differs from conventional phone time : <p> How calls are billed . Unlike with home telephone service , you pay not only for calls you make but for incoming calls . For outbound cellular calls , billing begins when you press the " send " button  --  not when the party you called picks up . The clock also keeps running for a few seconds after you push " end " to terminate your call . Because carriers charge for a full minute even for calls that are far briefer , those additional seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , if you let an unanswered call ring too long , you may even get billed for those " minutes " as well . <p> " Free " calls cost more . The minutes you spend making calls to toll-free numbers can be among your most expensive . You are charged for air time and , if you 're outside your home calling area , you may be charged at peak roaming rates . A two-minute toll-free call can easily cost between $1.50 and $2 . Directory assistance also comes at a steep price ; often as much as $1 . <p> " Extras " gobble up minutes . Service plans promote supplemental packages featuring " free " e-mail , voice messaging , and conference-calling . But you can run through minutes at double-time using these services . When someone leaves you a voice message , it comes out of your minutes . Your bucket is emptied again when you retrieve the message . Likewise , many newer handsets allow conference calls with two outside parties , but when you use this feature you are charged for two minutes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web-browsing capability now beginning to be offered can also devour air time . IS THE NETWORK RELIABLE ? <p> You can compare calling plans , rates , and coverage maps to see which provider can best meet your needs . But you can not check what may end up being the most important variable  --  whether your calls go through clearly and reliably  --  until you try a carrier 's network . Calls can get dropped when you leave one cell site ( the area a transmission tower covers ) and enter another whose circuits all happen to be in use . <p> The problem of call blocking is one consequence of the failure of providers to build sufficient capacity to handle the heavy call volume during peak hours . AT &T; Wireless subjected its subscribers in several cities to a bad case of dropped and blocked calls when new customers signed up en masse for its Digital One Rate plan . AT &T's; network could n't support the demand . <p> Similarly , Sprint PCS ran afoul of its customers who were hit by charges of as much as 69 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PCS ads promised would be " free . " The New York attorney general charged that Sprint PCS 's " national network " did not provide service in seven major cities at the time ads ran in 1998 . The case was settled out of court , and the ads were corrected . <p> The more common network problems that plague everyday callers are the result of dead spots within a provider 's service area , which cause dropped or blocked calls . The cellular companies monitor their territories in search of these pockets . Verizon Wireless , for example , says that it dispatches a fleet of 50 equipment-laden station wagons that rove thousands of miles each month to check its network . But the information revealed in the service providers ' hunts is a closely guarded secret , withheld even from the Federal Communications Commission . Consumers are kept in the dark . RECOMMENDATIONS <p> The challenges of choosing cellular service are as formidable as ever . Here 's how to zero in on a plan that wo n't disappoint : <p> Size up your needs . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere from $20 to $100 or more to your household expenses . It 's worth asking yourself whether you really need to take on that commitment . In our survey , seven out of ten respondents agreed with the proposition that having a cell phone " more than pays for itself in convenience and peace of mind . " And at least initially , most of our survey respondents signed up for service for use in the event of an emergency . <p> Weigh all your options . The Internet has made shopping for plans much easier than just a few years ago , when all you had to go on were service providers ' newspaper ads or brochures . Three web sites  --  www.getconnected.com , www.point.com , and www.telebright.com  --  can help you find the offerings of carriers serving most metropolitan markets and compare plans side by side . ( Price data in our table on page 15 were drawn from these three sources and confirmed with the providers in early December . They give a sampling of plan offerings available at the monthly service levels that suit a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepaid plan first . The consequences of committing to the wrong service contract can be costly , since most come with stiff early-termination penalties that can run as high as $200 . That 's why , if you 're new to cellular , it may be a good idea to size up how you 'll actually use the service before you sign on for a longer-term agreement . Most providers offer , at no monthly charge , plans that do n't require a contract . You 'll have to purchase an allotment of minutes separately and replenish your prepaid time when it runs out . Though more expensive on a per-minute basis , calling a la carte will help you better understand your usage patterns  --  and whether the carrier meets them . Armed with those insights , you 'll be better able to match a contract to your needs . <p> Do n't gorge on " free " minute plans . Bigger buckets of included minutes of air time and the extra off-peak time you can purchase for a few dollars more may be as tempting as an all-you-can-eat buffet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your account at month 's end can not be carried over , inflating the per-minute cost of calling time you do use . Half our survey respondents said they failed to use a half hour or more of talk time that they 'd paid for ; judging from their most recent bill , most had wasted an hour or more . ( Being overdrawn was much rarer : Only one in six exceeded their monthly allotment  --  half of them by a half hour or longer . The median number of minutes used was between 51 and 100 per month . ) <p> Keep track of air time . Most handsets can keep a running count of minutes used , which may help track calls . But they can not differentiate between peak and off-peak periods , if that matters in your plan . ( Be clear on what your carrier considers a " weekend "  --  some include Friday night , others do n't . ) Carriers themselves are n't too helpful . Verizon Wireless , for instance , lets you dial #MIN for a tally that might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roam off your carrier 's network , those fees might take a month or two to catch up with you . <p> Check contract details before signing . The price of getting a free or heavily discounted handset or the lowest per-minute rates might be a one- or two-year commitment with a stiff cancellation fee . But recognizing that it costs them less to hold onto a current customer than to recruit a new one , companies may allow you to upgrade or even downgrade your service plan without penalty . Some , including AT &T; Wireless and Cingular , make it easy to shrink or expand your monthly allotment of air time or your home-coverage area , but the changes may restart the contract 's clock . <p> When your contract expires . One year  --  the standard length of a cell-phone service contract  --  is an eternity in this fast-moving industry . When your contract is up for renewal , should you jump ship and sign on with another carrier ? ( If you do nothing , your service will typically continue on a monthly basis . ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice about switching providers : You may have to buy a new phone , pay a new activation fee , and get a new number . What 's more , the new carrier may present new aggravations . You may discover that you have problems calling in places where you 've been used to phoning without a hitch . <p> At this stage in its development , wireless Internet access is a chimera not worth paying extra to get . Switching might be worth the trouble , however , if you get a good deal on services you really want , like a bigger bucket of included minutes at little additional cost . In our survey , half the respondents who switched said they 'd found a better deal . Sizable numbers cited dissatisfaction with the service , or wanting a different type of phone or coverage over a wider area . <p> Survey outtakes Grumbles in the air <p> Only 50 percent of the respondents called themselves very or completely satisfied , our scale 's top marks ; 12 percent expressed some dissatisfaction with their current carrier . <p> Survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some point , often for a better price , better coverage , or just better service . <p> Survey outtakes Signal interruptus <p> Almost one in ten reported problems occurred often or fairly frequently when trying to get a connection from places their service is supposed to cover . More than half said that calls that do go through are at least occasionally dropped in midconversation . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> WHO 'S MINDING THE AIRWAVES ? <p> Industry insiders and the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , the regulatory agency that oversees the cellular airwaves , say that most of the service problems consumers face are the consequence of a still-young industry struggling to keep up with torrid growth . They are banking on competition to spur the heavy investments in network infrastructure that will eventually improve service . The FCC says it is revamping its methods for tracking consumer complaints , but it could n't tell us about the number or nature of current complaints and trends . <p> At a minimum , we think cell carriers should be required to report to the FCC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data public . Beyond that , it 's reasonable for consumers to expect agreed-upon service standards for getting a wireless call through . ( Such standards have existed many years for the regular telephone network . ) Finally , it should be possible for consumers to look up any carrier 's performance on the FCC 's web site  --  a public service that already lets airline passengers learn about flight delays and lost baggage on an airline- by-airline basis via the Department of Transportation web site . <p> New legislation may be needed to get the FCC to act . One such bill was introduced in Congress last session by Rep. Anthony D. Weiner ( D-N.Y . ) . His bill would require the FCC to set quality standards concerning dead spots in coverage , dropped calls , network busy signals , and improper billing . The FCC would also be obliged to operate a complaint hotline and to report on all carriers twice a year on the FCC web site . <p> In the meantime , one source with details on pending FCC actions and issues of consumer interest is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group based in Del Mar , Calif . <p> Until new protections are in place , subscribers will be forced to continue voting with their feet . About one in ten of our survey respondents cited poor service as their reason for changing carriers . Early-termination fees of up to $200 , we suspect , may hold many others back . <p> A SAMPLER OF PLANS : WHAT YOU GET FOR YOUR WIRELESS DOLLAR <p> We selected entry-level and step-up plans widely available from the largest wireless service providers . The $20 plans , the basic wireless contracts , include as little as a 20 minutes of monthly air time . The $30 plans offer more generous " buckets " of minutes and may offer a broader regional calling area . The nationwide calling plans come with no long-distance or roaming fees wherever you call in the U.S. Some service providers offer multiple nationwide plans ; the table lists their lowest-cost plan . <p> Extra minute fees are per-minute charges for calls exceeding a plan 's included air time . Roaming charge lists the maximum per-minute cost for calling time outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum cost of dialing among regions . The cancellation fee is what a subscriber pays to terminate a one-year contract before it expires . Some prices are expressed in a range , indicating that plan terms differ in some markets . All charges , including cancellation fees , were current as of mid-January . TABLE <p> CELLULAR HEALTH AND SAFETY UPDATE <p> Four out of five of our survey respondents told us that being able to call for help in the event of an emergency was their chief reason for getting a cell phone . But how well do the service providers fulfill that objective , and what about the other health and safety risks  --  exposure to radio waves and potentially fatal driver distraction  --  that the growing use of cell phones raise ? Here 's a rundown : Dialing 911 <p> Americans ring 911 from cell phones 118,000 times a day , and while most emergency calls get through , the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) can not say how many do not . The calls do n't get special priority  --  carriers are not required to clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dual-mode ( analog and digital ) or tri-mode ( analog , digital , and the higher frequency PCS band ) have a better chance to connect : If their call is blocked using one mode , they can switch automatically to a different band or network . <p> But there 's another serious shortcoming in emergency-call services . Because of network complexities , some 911 calls are n't routed to the closest response center  --  cell phones can not tell exactly where their owner is . " Enhanced " 911 , now being developed under FCC order , will pinpoint locations . But its rollout is still nearly a year off and , when implemented , may demand handsets with chips that read position from satellites . Until enhanced 911 arrives , if you can report even a rough location , that can speed getting help . Radio waves and cancer <p> A number of high-profile lawsuits have alleged that cell phones cause brain tumors , but to date no conclusive epidemiological evidence has demonstrated such a risk . Investigation into a possible link is ongoing under the guidance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with industry funding . The World Health Organization is also sponsoring an epidemiological study . Definitive answers are years away . <p> Nonetheless , the FCC has set limits on energy emitted by handset antennas . That number , now given on new models , is the SAR ( for specific absorption rate ) , which is capped at 1.6 watts per kilogram of tissue . Kenneth R. Foster , a bioengineering professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a leading researcher in low-level radio waves , cautions not to put too much stock in SAR figures . The absorption rates , he points out , can be measured in several ways and vary greatly when the phone is used , making it difficult to compare them meaningfully between phones . Below an as-yet-undetermined limit , Foster adds , smaller SARs are n't necessarily safer . If you 're concerned about exposure until more is known , Foster suggests that you use a headset that keeps the handset 's antenna away from your head . And , of course , limit your calls . Driving and talking <p> It 's self-evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1997 study published in The New England Journal of Medicine demonstrated how calling while driving increases the risk of accidents . The researchers concluded that using a cell phone quadrupled the chances of having an accident , and that using a hands-free kit did not lower the probability . Apparently , holding a conversation , not holding or fumbling with a phone , was decisive . <p> The problem of driver distraction has led more than a dozen nations  --  including Austria , Israel , and Italy  --  to impose restrictions on cell-phone use behind the wheel . Some local jurisdictions in the U.S. have passed ordinances curbing the use of cell phones on their roads . Last October , Suffolk County on New York 's Long Island , with 1.4 million residents , became the first U.S. county to ban use of handheld cell phones while driving . The law , which took effect in January , specifies a $150 fine . Proposals for similar bans are pending in other communities . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p>            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
