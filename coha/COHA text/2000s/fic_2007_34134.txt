Chapter 1 The army crept like a dark stain across the horizon . King Elend Venture stood motionless upon the Luthadel city wall , looking out at the enemy troops . Around him , ash fell from the sky in fat , lazy flakes . It was n't the burnt white ash that one saw in dead coals ; this was a deeper , harsher black ash . The Ashmounts had been particularly active lately . Elend felt the ash dust his face and clothing , but he ignored it . In the distance , the bloody red sun was close to setting . It backlit the army that had come to take Elend 's kingdom from him . " How many ? " Elend asked quietly . " Fifty thousand , we think , " Ham said , leaning against the parapet , beefy arms folded on the stone . Like everything in the city , the wall had been stained black by countless years of ashfalls . " Fifty thousand soldiers . . . " Elend said , trailing off . Despite heavy recruitment , Elend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasants with less than a year of training . Maintaining even that small number was straining his resources . If they 'd been able to find the Lord Ruler 's atium , perhaps things would be different . As it was , Elend 's rule was in seriousdanger of economic disaster . " What do you think ? " Elend asked . " I do n't know , El , " Ham said quietly . " Kelsier was always the one with the vision . " " But you helped him plan , " Elend said . " You and the others , you were his crew . You were the ones who came up with a strategy for overthrowing the empire , then made it happen . " Ham fell silent , and Elend felt as if he knew what the man was thinking . Kelsier was central to it all . He was the one who organized , the one who took all of the wild brainstorming and turned it into a viable operation . He was the leader . The genius . And he 'd died a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of his secret plan-had risen up in fury to overthrow their god emperor . Elend had taken the throne in the ensuing chaos . Now it was looking more and more like he would lose everything that Kelsier and his crew had worked so hard to accomplish . Lose it to a tyrant who might be even worse than the Lord Ruler . A petty , devious bully in " noble " form . The man who had marched his army on Luthadel . Elend 's own father , Straff Venture . " Any chance you can . . . talk him out of attacking ? " Ham asked . " Maybe , " Elend said hesitantly . " Assuming the Assembly does n't just surrender the city . " " They close ? " " I do n't know , honestly . I worry that they are . That army has frightened them , Ham . " And with good reason , he thought . " Anyway , I have a proposal for the meeting in two days . I 'll try to talk them out of doing anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ham nodded . " Just before the army 's advance . " " I think we should call a meeting of the crew , " Elend said . " See if we can come up with a way out of this . " " We 'll still be pretty shorthanded , " Ham said , rubbing his chin . " Spook is n't supposed to be back for another week , and the Lord Ruler only knows where Breeze went . We have n't had a message from him in months . " Elend sighed , shaking his head . " I ca n't think of anything else , Ham . " He turned , staring out over the ashen landscape again . The army was lighting campfires as the sun set . Soon , the mists would appear . I need to get back to the palace and work on that proposal , Elend thought . " Where 'd Vin run off to ? " Ham asked , turning back to Elend . Elend paused . " You know , " he said , " I 'm not sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the mists began to form around her . They puffed into existence as darkness fell , growing like tangles of translucent vines , twisting and wrapping around one another . The great city of Luthadel was still . Even now , a year after the Lord Ruler 's death and the rise of Elend 's new free government , the common people stayed in their homes at night . They feared the mists , a tradition that went far deeper than the Lord Ruler 's laws . Vin slipped forward quietly , senses alert . Inside herself , as always , she burned tin and pewter . Tin enhanced her senses , making it easier for her to see in the night . Pewter made her body stronger , made her lighter on her feet . These , along with copper-which had the power to hide her use of Allomancy from others who were burning bronze-were metals that she left on almost all the time . Some called her paranoid . She thought herself prepared . Either way , the habit had saved her life on numerous occasions . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'd never really understood how she burned metals ; she could remember doing it for as long as she 'd been alive , using Allomancy instinctively even before she was formally trained by Kelsier . It did n't really matter to her . She was n't like Elend ; she did n't need a logical explanation for everything . For Vin , it was enough that when she swallowed bits of metal , she was able to draw upon their power . Power she appreciated , for she well knew what it was like to lack it . Even now , she was not what one would likely envision as a warrior . Slight of frame and barely five feet tall , with dark hair and pale skin , she knew she had an almost frail look about her . She no longer displayed the underfed look she had during her childhood on the streets , but she certainly was n't someone any man would find intimidating . She liked that . It gave her an edge-and she needed every edge she could get . She also liked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confining despite its size . But at night the mists fell like a deep cloud . They dampened , softened , shaded . Massive keeps became shadowed mountains , and crowded tenements melted together like a chandler 's rejected wares . Vin crouched beside her building , still watching the intersection . Carefully , she reached within herself and burned steel-one of the other metals she 'd swallowed earlier . Immediately , a group of translucent blue lines sprang up around her . Visible only to her eyes , the lines pointed from her chest to nearby sources of metal-all metals , no matter what type . The thickness of the lines was proportionate to the size of the metal pieces they met . Some pointed to bronze door latches , others to crude iron nails holding boards together . She waited silently . None of the lines moved . Burning steel was an easy way to tell if someone was moving nearby . If they were wearing bits of metal , they would trail telltale moving lines of blue . Of course , that was n't the main purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouch and pulled out one of the many coins that sat within , muffled by cloth batting . Like all other bits of metal , this coin had a blue line extending from its center to Vin 's chest . She flipped the coin into the air , then mentally grabbed its line and-burning steel-Pushed on the coin . The bit of metal shot into the air , arcing through the mists , forced away by the Push . It plinked to the ground in the middle of the street . The mists continued to spin . They were thick and mysterious , even to Vin . More dense than a simple fog and more constant than any normal weather pattern , they churned and flowed , making rivulets around her . Her eyes could pierce them ; tin made her sight more keen . The night seemed lighter to her , the mists less thick . Yet , they were still there . A shadow moved in the city square , responding to her coin-which she had Pushed out into the square as a signal . Vin crept forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body than he had a year ago , during the days when he had acted the part of Lord Renoux . Yet , this balding , nondescript body had now become just as familiar to Vin . OreSeur met up with her . " Did you find what you were looking for , Mistress ? " he asked , tone respectful-yet somehow still a little hostile . As always . Vin shook her head , glancing around in the darkness . " Maybe I was wrong , " she said . " Maybe I was n't being followed . " The acknowledgment made her a bit sad . She 'd been looking forward to sparring with the Watcher again tonight . She still did n't even know who he was ; the first night , she 'd mistaken him for an assassin . And maybe he was . Yet , he seemed to display very little interest in Elend-and a whole lot of interest in Vin . " We should go back to the wall , " Vin decided , standing up . " Elend will be wondering where I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst of coins shot through the mists , spraying toward Vin.
