A few months ago , I started thinking about all of the things I wish I had known when I was sixteen and wish I could remember now that I 'm thirty . <p> I began my book a few months ago by telling her things like : <p> You should never have a job that you hate so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every week of your life . <p> Not to mention : <p> You wo n't meet your future husband at a bar . <p> And , my favorite : <p> Some days are a total waste of makeup . <p> In the past week , I 've come up with a few other pieces of advice I like , such as : <p> If you are going to show up at someone 's house unannounced , call at least five minutes in advance . This gives your hostess four minutes to race around the house collecting dirty dishes to throw in the sink , and another minute to plan your death . <p> All women think they can utter the following phrase : " If I had a dime for every sane member of my family , I 'd have a dime .

So stupendous that I must immediately ignore it , walk over to my computer , and stare at the e-mail on my screen : <p> Charlie , you 're overthinking this . Have fun at the Halloween party . Talk to whomever you want . As you said before , we 'll figure this out when I get home . No worries . <p> Crap . What did Jordan mean when he wrote that ? That we 're a couple who trust each other , and therefore I can have fun talking to whomever I want while he 's away in Paris ? <p> That he likes me , even though I 've insisted that we should be on a break while he is in Paris ? <p> That he 's already on the set sleeping with the Second A.D. ? <p> The past six weeks have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be my own damn fault . I recently wrote to my great-granddaughter : <p> You know what the right thing to do is , even though it 's usually easier ( and temporarily more fun ) to do the wrong thing . <p> The problem is , I do n't even know if I have done the right thing . Let me back up . Six weeks ago , after a particularly brutal weekend acting as maid of honor at my little sister 's wedding , I thought I had finally found my perfect guy , my reward for all of my torturous years of dating . Jordan Dumaurier . After several frustrating starts and stops in our relationship , both of us were totally free of our entanglements , and we were now dating each other . <p> Those next six weeks should have been bliss . I was n't working much , since my boss was out of the country . One of the perks of being a personal assistant to a successful boss is that they sometimes take off for Belize on a moment 's notice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie star Drew Stanton dined on plantains and readjusted his chakras in a Yucatn villa , I got to hang out with my new man and still collect a fat check every week , made out to Charlize Edwards . <p> Yes , Drew Stanton . As in the Drew Stanton : Golden Globe winner , Academy Award nominee , " Sexiest Man Alive " . . . complete lunatic . <p> But I say that with love . Drew is one of those forces of nature that seem to irreparably change all who enter his sphere of influence . In chaos theory , they refer to this as the butterfly effect . But if Drew is a butterfly , I 'm frankly never sure whether to stare at him in admiration or pin him to a corkboard . <p> But enough about him , let 's talk about me . And Jordan . <p> Jordan 's gig as set still photographer on Drew 's last . lm ended when the shoot wrapped , so he had time off , too . We spent four delicious weeks holed up in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all hours , and having sex , sex , and more sex . <p> Then , the unthinkable happened . He  --  gasp !  --  got a job offer . Oh , the horror . <p> Yes , I know , I 'm being a big baby . People have to work . It 's reality . And I even advised my great-granddaughter : <p> Do n't be jealous of spoiled rich kids . If you do n't work , you do n't have honor . <p> But here 's the problem : he did n't actually get one offer , he got two . One was to shoot stills for a . lm shooting in Los Angeles for the next three months . Taking that job would have allowed us to be in the same city during the holidays . The other job was for a movie shooting in Paris until the end of February . And he had to leave the next day . <p> He chose Paris . And I could n't help but feel that he had chosen Paris over me . <p> I spent the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and temporarily breaking up with him . <p> I did n't actually break up with him . What I did was tell him that long-distance relationships do n't work , and that we 'd be deluding ourselves if we thought we could weather a four-month split after a four-week courtship . I then quoted the " if it was meant to be " line , and said that when he got home , if we both wanted , we could start up exactly where we left off . <p> It all sounded perfectly logical at the time . I 've worked in the entertainment business for years , and ( with the exception of the marrieds ) I 've yet to see a four-month break ever lead to anything but a breakup . <p> Ever . <p> So , at the time , I felt like I had no choice . <p> That said , the moment he left , I backtracked like crazy . My first day alone I worked myself into a tizzy , convinced that the moment he walked off the plane , he would go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin woman with a sexy French accent and her sights set on my hunky American man . <p> Oh , she 's out there , and I hate her already . Cheeky little . . . <p> Anyway , I have spent the last two weeks continuing to work myself up into a psychological frenzy , and this past hour has been no different . I can not leave my computer screen for more than two minutes . Gazing at his latest e-mail is like watching a bad car wreck , or the latest Tom Cruise Scientology video  --  you want to turn away , but you ca n't . <p> I walk back to my living room , grab my notepad and my unopened cigarettes , head back to my office , look at the screen again , and stew . <p> Charlie , you 're overthinking this . Have fun at the Halloween party . Talk to whomever you want . As you said before , we 'll figure this out when I get home . No worries . <p> He wrote xoxo , J. Not Love , Jordan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Okay , yes , it 's better than Cheers ! Jordan , or ( God forbid ) Best , Jordan . Or his initials  --  JAD  --  that would be obnoxious . <p> But , I do n't know , I use xoxo for the friends I adore , not the man I 'm sleeping with . <p> Was sleeping with . <p> Then dumped for no good reason . <p> Scratch that . A very good reason . <p> Besides , we 've never said the L word to each other , and I 'd rather hear it in person ( preferably when he 's sober and standing up ) rather than in an impersonal e-mail . <p> My God , if I spent half as much time exercising as I do obsessing about men , I 'd weigh what it says on my driver 's license by now . <p> I glance over at the pack of cigs and sigh . I also quit smoking six weeks ago . I did n't do it f or Jordan , I did it f or me . Well , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my only motivation was the promise of sex whenever I wanted . Which does help with those oral cravings , I must admit . <p> But then the sex went to Paris , and now I 'm just abstaining because I really enjoy getting road rage , eating enough in a day to sustain a small horse , and constantly wanting to slam my head through a wall . <p> My home phone rings . I pick up on the second ring . " Hello ? " <p> If you ever become a rock star , whether you have one hit or twenty , you are still never entitled to have a CD entitled The Essential Collection . <p> " Huh ? " I ask . <p> " That 's my advice for your book , " my best friend Dawn says . " I mean , you know , the Beatles could get away with it . But Hall and Oates ? Tom Jones ? Please . " <p> " Not bad , " I say , writing down her advice . <p> " Or The Ultimate Collection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say in the background on Dawn 's end of the line . <p> " Who has that ? " I hear Dawn ask Kate . <p> " Shalamar and Ace of Base , " Kate says . <p> I hear Dawn mutter " Ugh , " as I ask her , " Where are you guys ? " <p> " The Grove . Kate dragged me here so we could do a little Christmas shopping . " <p> Ah , yes , the last week in October . The week most stores start putting up Christmas decorations  --  and Kate becomes a raving Christmas lunatic . You would think one of the city 's top political radio show hosts would view the holiday season with a certain sense of perspective and decorum . <p> You 'd be wrong . <p> Last year , Kate 's apartment included one dancing Santa , two Christmas trees , and a life-size flying reindeer . <p> " Tell her about the New Year 's resolutions , " I hear Kate say cheerfully . <p> " The what ?

" <p> " It means you are one crazy heifer , " Dawn says emphatically . " You 've become the girl who forwards a man 's e-mail to all of her friends . You made the right decision : get rid of him for now . Men are like trains : one does n't just come every twelve minutes , it usually doubles back eight hours later , during the afternoon rush hour . " <p> My phone beeps . " Hang on , that 's my call waiting , " I click over . " Hello ? " <p> " Do n't listen to her ! " Kate counters from her cell phone . She 's probably all of two feet away from Dawn . " Breaking up with Jordan just because you 've had previous problems with long-distance relationships is making him pay for the mistakes of his competitors . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely open and emptied for the joy that is to come . " <p> " Did you just tell Charlie to be an airhead every time she dates a new guy ? " I hear Dawn ask incredulously in the background of Kate 's line . <p> " You 're paraphrasing my words in a foolish manner to defeat my position of love and openness . This is a reflection of your pain , not a condemnation of my hope . According to this book I 'm reading  --  " <p> " Do n't make me come over there with a shoe ! " Dawn counters . <p> " Well , I 'm not going to let you sabotage Charlie 's love life just because you ca n't make yourself emotionally available to a man , " Kate says firmly to Dawn . <p> " Can you hold on a sec ? " I ask Kate . <p> " Sure . " <p> I click back over to Dawn . " What the hell is she talking about ? " <p> " I begged her to stay out of the self-help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost hear her shaking her head , " but not only did she sneak in , she bought books , took notes , and is trying to drag us into her sick little world . . . . " <p> Kate 's voice suddenly comes in loud and clear , meaning she has taken the phone away from Dawn . " Sometime next week , you 're both coming to my house so we can do our New Year 's resolutions . " <p> " New Year 's is n't for more than two months , " I remind her . " And I have n't finished ignoring the ten pounds I planned to lose last year . " <p> " No , no . I just read this amazing book : Dream It , Do It , Deal with It . It 's all about figuring out what you really want in life , then forcing yourself toward your goals every day . One of the tricks is to make New Year 's resolutions every month , instead of once a year . " <p> " Tell Charlie what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say dryly . <p> I hear Kate sigh . " That 's the negativity talking , " she insists to Dawn . <p> " Ya think ? " Dawn asks sarcastically . <p> " What does the Deal with It mean ? " I am curious to know . <p> " Oh , that 's for when you get your dreams , but you 're still not happy , " Kate says quickly , trying to skirt over that part . " But I 'm telling you , the rest is genius . " <p> " Boo , can I have my phone back ? " Dawn asks , " I want to text Charlie . " <p> " Sure , " Kate says . " Charlie , click back over to my phone . " <p> I click back to Kate 's phone , and hear Dawn hang up . " You really think Jordan still likes me ? " I ask Kate . <p> " Of course he does , " Kate assures me . <p> My iPhone gives me a little explosion to let me know I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not following my earlier advice to my great-granddaughter : <p> Do n't wait by the phone . <p> I immediately click on my text inbox to see Dawn 's number , followed by the message : <p> Blow him out of the water , and leave him for dead . <p> What are you wearing to the Halloween party ? Be sexy , but not desperate . <p> Love , <p> Dawn <p> P.S. ( Note how I did not dare write xoxoD ) <p> That 's easy for her to say . Dawn is stunningly beautiful . The product of three interracial marriages ( her grandparents are Hispanic , Jewish , Japanese , and African American ) , she seems to have swum through the world 's largest gene pool , and come out perfect . Well , not perfect . She flunked Physics back when we were in college together . But I 've yet to hear a man ask her about that . <p> Do n't obsess about your looks , but do n't ignore them , either . potential suitors ca n't see your brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need eyelid surgery ? " Kate asks . <p> The girl has rendered me speechless for a moment . " As opposed to what ? " I finally ask . <p> " Well , a boob job , I suppose . Or maybe the collagen lips thing . " <p> " Trout pout 's over , " I hear Dawn warn in the background . <p> " Fair enough , " Kate concedes . " But I have to do something . I have n't been out in the dating world for nine years . I need something to spruce up my image . " <p> " Hey ! Size four ! " I hear Dawn yell , " For the love of all that is holy . . . put the diet book down ! " <p> I hear Dawn take the phone from Kate . " We got ta go . I have to get the girl to a hot fudge sundae before she completely loses it . Are you gon na be okay ? " <p> I stare absentmindedly at Jordan 's e-mail . " Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're meeting at your place at eight . Call me if you need to talk . Bye . " <p> " Bye , " I say , and hang up the phone . <p> I let my bottom lip puff out in self-pity as I read again : <p> Charlie , you 're overthinking this . Have fun at the Halloween party . Talk to whomever you want . As you said before , we 'll figure this out when I get home . No worries . <p> I stare at my computer , and click on my inbox . An e-mail telling me I 've just won twenty-five million pounds in the British lottery , and another one trying to sell me Viagra . ( I am curious as to how I got on that spam list . ) <p> I force myself to walk away from the computer , only to see a different pack of unopened cigarettes beckoning me from the dining room table . <p> I purse my lips together as I stare at them . <p> Cigarettes . I really should quit buying them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packs of them around . It 's like a little black book of old boyfriends ' phone numbers : just knowing they 're there in an emergency makes me feel better . <p> My iPhone rings . I check the caller ID . My boss , Drew Stanton . <p> The butterfly has emerged from his cocoon . <p> I pick up . " Hi , Drew . " <p> " What does a manic depressive act like ? " Drew asks me , sounding like he 's in a state of utter distress . <p> " Well , " I begin , trying to come up with a succinct definition . " They act sort of like you , only they get depressed sometimes . " <p> " Okay , then that 's not it , " Drew says quickly . " Then I think I 'm having a panic attack . " <p> " Did you accidentally climb into that crocodile exhibit again ? " I ask sternly . <p> " No . " <p> " Are you hanging three thousand feet in the air without a net ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And I thought we agreed you would never speak of that incident again . " <p> " My bad , " I apologize . " Are there any sharks , snakes , or hitmen within ten feet of you ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Then you 're probably not having a panic attack , " I conclude . " You only tend to have those when there 's a genuine need for panic . " <p> " Okay , " Drew concedes . " So then , what does a heart attack feel like ? " <p> " You know , this would go a lot faster if you 'd just tell me what happened . " <p> " I 've been . red , " Drew says , sounding like he 's hyperventilating . <p> " The head of Pinnacle called my agent to say that they do n't think they should be spending two hundred million dollars to make Men in Motion 2 . I 'm out of a job ! " <p> Oh , crap . If Drew is out of a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday season filling his days by trying to find the perfect religion , the perfect woman , or the perfect Pre-Colombian pottery . And he 'll be dragging me along with him on that quest . <p> Before I can respond , Drew 's voice changes completely , going from a tone of sheer terror to one of contemplation and calm . " You know , he 's telling the Hollywood Reporter it 's ' creative differences , ' but , really , I think he 's mad about the hippo . " <p> The hippo . I think to myself . <p> Drew is silent on the other end , waiting for my response . Finally , I oblige him . " And by hippo you would mean . . . ? " <p> " Ida . " <p> " Ida , " I repeat , trying to figure out what clever wordplay he 's used for his latest animal acquisition . Last month it was an elephant named Cindy ( short for Cinderelephant  --  is n't he clever ? ) . <p> So Ida must be . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't do something so insane as to adopt a hippo ' ? " I ask . <p> " Nah , " Drew says , and I can hear by his tone of voice that he 's waving me off with his hand . " I named her after my aunt Ida . They 're both short and fat , and have huge legs . I rescued her from an estate in Costa Rica . " <p> I 'm dead silent . It 's like joining an in-progress conversation that includes the phrase " Dirty Sanchez . " You wo n't be able to catch up , and you wo n't have anything interesting to add , so just stay quiet . <p> " I was going to name her Hippocrates , " Drew continues . " But then I thought , that 's a little on the nose . Besides , she 's a girl . What would people think if I gave her a boy 's name ? Then of course , I thought of naming her after my uncle : but it turns out the word hypocrite has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still stay quiet . <p> " Are you still there ? " Drew asks . <p> " Barely , " I say , sighing . <p> The next words out of my mouth are words I never thought I 'd have to utter in my lifetime . " Did n't I specifically tell you that you could n't get a hippo ? " <p> " Yes , you did , " Drew says breezily , " but then I remembered that you work for me , I do n't work for you . Which means you 're not the boss of me . " <p> Well , he sure told me . <p> " In my defense . . . , " Drew continues . <p> " Can you hold on a second ? " I ask Drew . <p> " Sure , " he says . <p> I jot down in my notebook : <p> No good has ever come from a conversation that began with the words , " In my defense . . . " <p> " Okay , you were saying . . . ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hippos that were about to be destroyed if no one took them . It was on the news . A bunch of zoos took the other hippos , and the only hippo left was Ida . So , I found this wildlife refuge that agreed to take Ida if I could get her to them , and pay for the ninety pounds of food she eats every day . And all that was supposed to happen was that I was supposed to pay to have Ida transported to the refuge . Only , the company in charge of the move I guess got confused , because they sent her to my house . " <p> What the fuck ? Who sends a two-ton hippo to the middle of Brentwood ? <p> " Only , they did n't actually send her to my house , " Drew continues . " Because I specifically told them I live at 3592 Greenlawn . But they sent her to 3952 Greenlawn . Which , the good news on that is , the owners of 3952 have a pool , and they 've graciously allowed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get someone to bring her to the refuge . " <p> I shake my head and sigh . " And the bad news ? " <p> " The bad news is the owner of 3952 Greenlawn is also the head of Pinnacle Studios . And I 've been . red due to ' creative differences . ' " <p> " And by creative differences you mean . . . " <p> " He thought sending a hippopotamus to the head of a studio was not particularly creative . " <p> " Ah . " <p> Figures . This is just so typical of Drew . Working for a movie star is like working for an unhousebroken puppy with a Black American Express card : You spend part of your life cleaning up after him , part of your life wanting to yell , " Sit . Stay , " and part of your life wondering how someone so stupid can be so successful that they have a Black American Express Card . <p> Drew continues , " I need you to come here with one hundred pounds of grass , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual grass . Plus a pastrami on rye for me , light mayo , extra tomatoes . " <p> I roll my eyes as I jot down his demands on a notepad . I went to college so I could ask my next question , " You want fries with that ? " <p> " Yes , the curly kind . Oh , and call whomever it is one would call to wrangle an amorous hippo . " <p> " Wait , " I say , closing my eyes to wince as I unconsciously lift up the palm of my hand in a " Stop " motion . " What do you mean ' amorous ' ? " <p> " Um . . . amorous . It means lovesick , in heat , horny as a teenage boy on Jell-O shots . . . . " <p> " I know what it means , " I interrupt . " I meant , why is she amorous ? " <p> I hear what sounds like a tuba playing on Drew 's end of the line . <p> " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sexually involved with a hippo , I would date my old high-school girlfriend . " <p> I spend the next thirty minutes making arrangements to have Ida picked up and moved to a wildlife refuge , and calling a stable and a deli so that when I get to 3952 Greenlawn , I will be armed with one hundred pounds of grass , and a pastrami on rye with curly fries . <p> Well , on the plus side , I have n't thought about Jordan 's e-mail for two of those thirty minutes . <p> Man , why ca n't I stop thinking about Jordan ? Why am I letting this relationship color every other aspect of my life ? It 's becoming like OCD : I 'm obsessed with figuring out what I have to do to get him to want me all the time . I have entire conversations between the two of us  --  completely in my head . All I can think about lately is kissing him . <p> I once read that an alcoholic 's brain is set up to always think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . No matter how satisfying the job the alcoholic holds , she thinks about happy hour at the end of the day . No matter how fulfilling a family life the alcoholic has , or what hobbies she enjoys , all her brain does is compartmentalize those things while mentally in search of the next drink . <p> For me : I 'm not appreciating anything great that 's going on in my life because in my mind all I 'm doing is killing time until the next time I get to see Jordan . <p> I 'm a Jordanoholic . <p> Sigh . Maybe admitting it is the first step to recovery . <p> I look over at the cigarettes centerpiecing my dining-room table with a longing that should only be reserved for high-school crushes and Johnny Depp sightings . <p> I pick up the cigarettes from the table , and examine the little cellophane tab on the pack . <p> One pull and they could all be mine . . . . <p> Maybe some nicotine gum would make me saner . <p> Maybe a new relationship would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tired of being a silver medalist . <p> Every two years , I find myself feeling sorry for the person who wins the silver medal at the Olympics . They spend their entire lives focused on one goal : to win the gold medal in an event , in anything from men 's skiing to women 's synchronized swimming . Years and years of training : waking up at five in the morning when your friends are sleeping in ; enduring bruises , sprains , and broken bones while your friends are off at the mall . Forgoing school dances , or the prom , so that you can travel to amateur athletic events in states you never had any interest in seeing . So much sacrifice , just in the desperate hope that you will one day attain your goal , the elusive gold medal . <p> And that 's what dating is like . You spend years and years training : You work out , ( okay , I do n't , but I know I should ) , you diet , you learn how to wear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make you look good to the opposite sex .

Then , by your early twenties , you realize that men would prefer you to actually eat , so you order the chicken , or the second cheapest thing on the menu if you do n't want to look too obvious . Then you realize they 're onto you about the chicken , and you look ridiculous so , fuck it , you order the steak . <p> In other words , you observe your skills in this arena , you adjust your behavior , you perfect your technique .

Why must we constantly be tested ? Should n't it be enough to find the guy ? And what is it about our genetic makeup that even when we have the guy , we still are n't sure what to do next ? <p> I shake my head to clear the cobwebs . Hippo , I think as I throw down the cigarettes , grab my purse , and head out the door . <p> Maybe Ida can keep my mind off Jordan for a few more minutes . <p> Excerpted from Misery Loves Cabernet by KIM GRUENENFELDER <br> Copyright 2009 by Kim Gruenenfelder <br> Published in April 2009 by St. Martin
