<p> Secretary of State Colin Powell will meet with Yasser Arafat in Ramallah this morning , resurrecting his sidetracked peacemaking mission when the Palestinian leader Saturday issued a statement in Arabic condemning terrorist acts against civilians . <p> " We decided that this was the right thing to do , " said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher . <p> Powell postponed the visit after Friday 's bombing in Jerusalem killed six bystanders and a Palestinian woman , 20-year-old Andaleeb Taqataqah , who hid a bomb on her body . Before the latest attack in Israel , Powell had been poised to meet with Arafat on Saturday , even though he did not meet the precondition demanded by President Bush of denouncing terrorism . <p> Friday 's suicide bombing  --  the 37th in Israel since January  --  changed the fragile diplomatic equation and resulted in the statement , released in the name of Arafat and the Palestinian leadership . They expressed " condemnation of all terrorist acts against civilians , whether they are Israelis , Palestinians and whether this terrorism is sponsored by a state , group or person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " bloodbaths " against Palestinian civilians by Israeli troops in West Bank cities . Israel mobilized its military after a suicide bomber killed 27 people attending a Seder last month . <p> Ismail Abu Shanab , a spokesman for the Islamic militant group Hamas , said attacks would go on . " We have the full right to react without any limitation against the state terrorism of Israel , " he said , as reported by the Associated Press . <p> Powell on Saturday met with humanitarian workers who have been blocked by Israelis from delivering assistance to ravaged West Bank areas , where fighting continued . <p> As part of the diplomatic package , Powell warned Israel to " exercise the utmost restraint and discipline and refrain from the excessive use of force in the conduct of military operations in order to ensure that civilians are protected and to avoid worsening the already grave conditions in Palestinian areas . " <p> Israel was called upon by Powell to " respect international humanitarian principles and to allow full and unimpeded access to humanitarian organizations . " <p> Arafat 's statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official news agency of the Palestinian Authority . Powell 's team was passed a copy through the Palestinians on Saturday . Talking to reporters in the Jerusalem hotel where Powell 's team is staying , Boucher said , " The statement issued earlier by Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian leadership contains a number of interesting and positive elements . " <p> After assessing those remarks , the decision was made for Powell to travel to Arafat 's compound in Ramallah , where he has been in a virtual house arrest , pinned down by Israeli military forces outside his presidential headquarters . <p> In the meeting , Boucher said , Powell " will work with Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian leadership to show leadership and to help make these statements a reality with effective action to bring an end to terror and violence and an early resumption of a political process . " <p> Arafat 's statement seems to have been anticipated , since Powell spent Friday evening conferring with other foreign leaders . He spoke twice by phone with King Abdullah II of Jordan ; he also conferred with Egyptian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and European officials . Arafat consulted Friday with Maher and other Palestinian officials . <p> Boucher said Arafat 's statement calling for a " just peace between the two peoples and two countries " does contain " a number of interesting and positive elements . " <p> The United States is mindful that Arafat has issued similar declarations against violence in the past . <p> " You heard us express our disappointment with statements that were made that were not fulfilled , " Boucher said . " This is a start , you might say . We can go down and work with Chairman Arafat and try to build on this and try to accomplish what we want to accomplish , which is to get an effective action to bring terrorism and violence to an end . " <p> Israeli officials have been against Powell meeting face-to-face with Arafat , with or without a statement condemning violence and regardless of Friday 's bombing near a crowded produce market . <p> Powell will ask Arafat to deliver more than words , Boucher said . The United States has made the point " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " along the lines of the kind of statements we wanted to see . But it always needs to be followed by effective action . " <p> The meeting has generated worldwide interest as Israel 's latest campaign to uproot terrorists is generating international controversy , as violence escalates and threatens to grow into an all-out war that could ensnare other countries in the region . As a matter of course , however , Arafat and Powell talk regularly . <p> Several alternatives are being floated , including creation of a multinational force to help keep the peace while political solutions leading to the creation of a state of Palestine are revived . United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said such a force is needed because " the situation is so dangerous . " <p> Powell 's trip is open-ended and is expected to include more conferences with top Israeli officials . Powell spent more than four hours Friday in talks , including a more than two-hour one-on-one with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon . <p> Church standoff <p> At the U.S. Consulate here , Powell spent around 45 minutes Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches in Jerusalem and then with a delegation of humanitarian aid workers who have been denied access by the Israelis to the besieged West Bank cities . <p> He was presented with a suggestion for a three-day truce for Bethlehem , where about 200 armed Palestinians have fortified themselves inside the fortress-like Church of the Nativity on Manger Square , a sacred site to Christians as the birthplace of Christ . <p> Israeli Defense Force Col. Gal Hirsch said Friday the " Israeli army is trying to deal with this crisis and to take all the precautions to preserve " the church . <p> " We have had some contacts with some terrorists in there , and we were trying very hard to arrange a meeting with them two days ago . In spite of our efforts , they did n't come to the meeting , and we are still waiting . ... There are 230 terrorists inside the church , some of them very senior terrorists belonging to Tanzim , to Hamas and to Islamic Jihad . <p> " We know that they want to evacuate a dead body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . We are ready to talk about everything , but we need to talk with them . ... We need to talk with the terrorists because they took the church by force . ... So we are waiting , and the ball is in their court . " <p> Humanitarian aid <p> Powell later met with workers from a variety of organizations that are active in West Bank relief efforts , which have been slowed down by Israeli troops concerned that weapons may be smuggled in or out of the region . <p> The biggest flashpoint is in the Jenin refugee camp in the northern West Bank , which has taken many casualties , though the number is disputed by the two sides . <p> " We are particularly concerned at the humanitarian situation in Jenin , " Powell told representatives of the UN , International Red Cross and other organizations . <p> To demonstrate the United States ' " long-standing support for the welfare of the Palestinian people , " Powell announced a $30 million payment to UN relief programs and another $62 million to the U.S. Agency for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming weeks will consider long-term reconstruction needs of the Palestinian Authority , which is left without an infrastructure to maintain a government to oversee a peace plan or cease-fire.
