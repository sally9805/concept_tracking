Water laps against the quay of Portoferraio . Hungry dogs blink in the sunlight . A grocer stacks oranges . A carabiniere checks the time on his wristwatch . A girl chases a cat into a courtyard . Men argue in the shade of an archway . A woman rubs a rag over a shop window . Heels click on stone . Bottles rattle in the back of a flatbed truck . A boy writes graffiti on the wall above the steps leading to the Liceo Raffaello . German tourists hesitate before filing into a bar . An old woman , puzzled to find herself still alive at the end of the century , sits on a bench in Piazza Repubblica , her eyes closed , her lips moving in a silent prayer to San Niccol . I have seen the faded frescoes of San Niccol in the church in San Piero . I drove to this little enclave yesterday in search of a grotto that is supposed to be full of tourmaline . After wandering through the hills without finding the grotto , I returned to San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Appiano fortress . The emptiness felt so complete that the shadow of a man on the granite wall startled me-my own shadow , squat in the light of late morning . Inside the church , Niccol has watched the world with knowing eyes for six hundred years . Bloodied Niccol , who knows everything about everyone and will never be surprised . When the earth 's ancient fire cooled and shrank toward the core , it left behind a hard , uneven shelf of land along the west coast of the peninsula of Italy that was extraordinarily rich with minerals- with hematite , magnetite , pyrite , quartz , agate , and tourmaline running in pure veins through the deep folds of metamorphic rock . Millions of years later , the fire inside the earth flared , tremors vibrated in the glaciers , and the Tuscan Archipelago broke away from the continent . Vents opened in mountain peaks . Basaltic lava flowed over the land . Rain cooled the lava into rock , storm winds wore the rock smooth , rivers cut channels , dust turned to soil , soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew , diverse species of plants and animals evolved . A unique species of poisonous snake made its home on Montecristo . Each island had its own kind of beetle . At one time , small brown bears lived in the caves of Elba , a prehistoric species of rhinoceros roamed the fields , and lynx hunted the newborn foals of wild horses . Like all bodies of land , the island of Elba would continue to change . Everything on Elba would change , except the minerals . Deep inside the ground the minerals of Elba would remain what they were , pure , intact , untouched by measurable time . At Pomonte , follow the road to the right of the church beyond the last of the village houses . Continue up the rise . At the fork , cross the little cement bridge and climb the granite steps to the mule track . Follow the track through the vineyards , keeping the stream to your left . Continue past the last vines and into the woods . Cross through a chestnut grove , go forward about a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and continue into another wood of white poplar and oak . Eventually you will come to an old sheepfold and shepherd 's cottage at the top of Grottaccia hill . If you look carefully at the dome of the cottage , you will see that no mortar was used . The skillful builders constructed the dome simply by putting one stone on top of another . Four thousand years ago , a woman stood in the grotto of San Giuseppe and poured oil from a vase into a bowl . She crumbled dried rosemary into the oil and pounded it to make a paste . She rubbed the paste on the forehead of her sleeping child to take away his fever . Three thousand years ago , two Greeks , who happened to be brothers , tended a smelting fire . When the burning wood suddenly popped and sparked , the brothers lurched back with a gasp . The fire burned on . The ore melted . The brothers laughed at their cowardice . They decided to name the island Aethalia after the sparking fires . They knew these fires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Etruscan patriarch stood on the steps of the acropolis on Volterraio and admired the island 's beauty . He decided then and there to deliver an edict moving the smelting furnaces to the mainland territory of Populonia . Two thousand years ago , a Roman mapmaker wandered the island , recording the contours of land , the presence of rivers and streams , the size of villages . The most prosperous villages belonged to the Ilvates-settlers who had come from Liguria-so the mapmaker decided to name the island Ilva . The name of Elba , replacing Ilva , first appears in Gregory the Great 's Dialogues , written in the second half of the sixth century A.D. Hair tangled by the salty seabreeze . Sparkle of quartz dust . Pigskin ball sailing through the air . Clamor of American soldiers in pursuit . Confusion , laughter , protest , happiness , youth . Still the men in the shade of the archway are arguing , still the old woman sitting on the bench in Piazza Repubblica in Portoferraio is mouthing a silent prayer . The boy who was writing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar , trying to decide whether or not to go in . Follow the path from Marciana toward the San Cerbone monastery . At the little lay-by area beyond the woods , take the steep narrow track through the shade of tree-heath . Climb over the broad granite slabs and across the screes to the ridge , where the paths for Poggio and Sant'Ilario meet . Keep following the track up the eastern slope of Monte Capanne , through the scrub of lavender and genista , proceed in a steep climb for about half an hour to the summit . If the day is clear , you will be able to see the coast of Tuscany in one direction , the mountains of Corsica in the other . Five hundred years ago , a mother hid with her three children in the family 's dank lightless cantina in Marina di Campo . The father had locked the door from the outside and left to fight with his neighbors against Khayr ad-Din , the pirate known as Barbarossa . The mother sang to her children , and then the children took turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them and nothing to drink but wine . When the father unlocked the door three days later , his family tumbled out , dissolute , overcome with hilarity . Four hundred and fifty years ago , twelve young men and women were dragged from their homes in the township of Fabricia onto a boat bound for Tunisia , where they would serve as slaves for the rest of their lives . Two hundred years ago , the young British painter John Robert Cozens , son of the painter Alexander Cozens , looked out through a window of the chiesetta di Madonna di Monserrato and tried to mix colors on his pallet to match the color of the hills above Porto Azzurro . He decided the best he could hope for was honorable failure . Follow the road to the right of the Fortezza pisana for about a hundred meters . Turn left onto the mule track that continues into the woods . Continue past the bronze statue of the angel to the paved road that is flanked by the fourteen Stations of the Cross . Follow this through the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ del Monte . According to the legend , shepherds discovered an image of the Virgin painted on a chunk of granite . They carried the rock to their valley , but the next morning when they woke the rock had been returned to the exact place where they 'd first found it on Monte Giove . The shepherds took this as a sign that they should erect a church at the site . It was here that Napoleon stayed for two weeks during his exile in 1814 . The sun . The wind . Fragrance of rosemary and rock roses , lavender and beer . Sound of pebbles sloshing in the lazy waves . American soldiers breaking from a huddle . Run , jump , twist , crash , fall , get up again , and hike . Yessirree , we could get used to this place ! Touchdown ! After the short reign of Napoleon , the island reverted to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and , in 1860 , to the Kingdom of Italy . During the Risorgimento , the mines of Elba were expanded to meet Italy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than two hundred young Elban men were killed fighting on the mainland . After the war , labor unrest escalated on the island . In 1920 , miners occupied the administrative offices of the Alti Forni of Portoferraio , demanding an improvement in working conditions and a reduction in prices for food and dry goods . An agreement was reached after a two-month standoff . The Cinema Moderno opened in Portoferraio in 1924 . The Festa dell'Uva was initiated . Mussolini visited the island on several occasions between 1928 and 1936 . The Second World War arrived on Elba in September 1943 . On the sixteenth of the month , beginning at 11:30 A.M. , seven German bombers buzzed across the sky above Portoferraio . By 4:00 in the afternoon , more than one hundred civilians were dead , and the people of Elba had surrendered . Nine months later , the Allies attacked in an invasion called " Operation Brassard , " planned by General De Lattre de Tassigny . A group of " commandos d'Afrique " led the way early in the morning on the seventeenth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the seventeenth and eighteenth , Portoferraio was bombed sixteen times . The fighting was swift and severe . The Ninth French Colonial Division lost hundreds of men but managed to take twelve hundred German soldiers prisoner . What had begun as an apparently minor Allied operation reawakened and reinforced German fears of Allied landings behind the Germans ' western flank . The Germans retreated into the Appenines . The Allies instated a military government on Elba . And in July an obscure American Division arrived to oversee the distribution of supplies . The Americans , with their chocolate and cigarettes , Spam and rice . The American boys turning war into a holiday . The Americans wanting to do nothing but strip down to their shorts and play football on the beach at Le Ghiaie . Bare toes curling over hot gravel . Shining faces and salt-bleached hair . The men are arguing about the war . I know because I started the argument . I 'd fallen into conversation with one of the men , stopping to ask for directions and then going on to ask more probing questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island . I asked him if he remembered the American soldiers who came to Elba in the summer of 1944 . He said he 'd been serving in the Italian navy in Puglia at the time , but he 'd heard about the Americans and their games . We were joined by his friend . The two men got to talking about the occupation of the Germans and the invasion of the Allies . The men disagreed about the value of the Liberation . Other men joined us . They talked rapidly , but I could make out the gist of the argument . Some believed the Allies had saved the island ; others thought they 'd come close to destroying it . One man ripped up a receipt he 'd carried from the grocer and threw the pieces on the ground . Eccola . That is what the man would have his friends do with the past . They seemed to forget me , and I withdrew without a word . I walked from the archway into the piazza and saw the old woman sitting on the bench . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I noticed that her eyes were closed and her lips moving in silent prayer . I spent the morning wandering the island . Walking back through the piazza later , I saw the same old woman on the bench and the men still arguing in the archway . I saw an English couple coming out of a bar , balancing cones topped with towers of gelati . I read the graffiti on the wall above the stairs leading to Liceo Raffaello : " Michela un sogno . " I returned to my hotel room and opened the window . The hotel is adjacent to the vineyard of La Chiusa , and I can smell the ripe grapes . I hear doves cooing in the palms , a rooster crowing up in the hills , motorcycles buzzing and trucks rattling along the main road . On the table in front of me I 've set out the faded deed I found among my father 's papers last month when I was helping my mother get ready for a yard sale . The deed names my father as owner of five hectares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my thumb . Though there are many signatures and a stamp on the last page , the claim is worthless , local officials have already informed me . Why , then , do n't I just turn around and go home ? The woman I lived with for seven years called two weeks ago to tell me that she is getting married . When I invited her to come to Elba with me , she laughed , her tone one of easy fellowship , as if she 'd just chucked me on the shoulder . This is my first visit back to the island since the mid-1950s , and though I 've only been here for three days I 'm already looking forward to returning again soon . I consider myself lucky to have the liberty and resources to travel . My brothers agree among themselves that I 'm indulging in nostalgia and remind me that there are better ways to spend my money . Our father had been to Elba himself during the war and stayed long enough to play football on the beach and swim in the tepid sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that the sun always shines on Elba , wildflowers bloom year round , Elbans will give away the jackets off their backs , and pirates know it is a good place to bury stolen treasure . Where on earth is Elba ? we wanted to know . It is an island not far from the coast of Italy , our father said . Napoleon once reigned in exile there . Where is Italy ? we asked while we watched our parents pack for the journey . Who is Napoleon ? What is exile ? Forty-three years later , I am like a blind man feeling my way through a house that has appeared repeatedly in my dreams . I recognize everything , though nothing is familiar . Much has changed , of course . When I came here with my family , Elba was still dependent on its mining industry . Now it is an active tourist resort . It is just after the high season , and the island seems tranquil to me , but it is overrun in summer , people say . I have been warned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Azzurro during July and August . Hotel reservations should be made far in advance , expect traffic jams , do n't bother with the crowded beaches at Bagnaia and Procchio and Marciana Marina , forget about getting into the Villa Demidoff or hiking to the top of Volterraio or riding the Monte Capanne cable car . Better yet , avoid Elba altogether and go to Corsica . The soft breeze of the scirocco . The rustle of palm fronds . Piping of a nightingale . Two girls riding bareback on the same brown horse . The granite cap of Monte Capanne shining like snow in the distance . Dust rising behind a jeep as it climbs a cart road to Buraccio and disappears beneath the holm oaks .
