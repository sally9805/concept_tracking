Hank says : " Pan Am is run by the CIA , you know . " He says : " There 's trouble brewing here . Out there . " He points with his chin . " In the sugar cane fields . In the jungle . " He says : " Hemingway knows . He knows all about it . " <p> Clara says nothing . She is thinking that she ca n't even get this one thing right . That the DC-3 sitting on the airfield at the Havana airport with a maintenance problem has stranded her at this hotel with this man , this stranger . When he hands her the sweating daiquiri , his fingers brush hers lightly , like a promise . <p> A little girl in a pink and yellow striped bathing suit runs past them , swinging a blue plastic pail filled with water . Clara closes her eyes against the happy , laughing child , presses them shut so tightly that a stab of pain shoots through them , right in the center , in the place where her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , the girl is gone . Clara has fallen asleep from too much rum , too much one-sided chatter , too much brilliant sunshine . <p> " Whoa , " Hank says . " Sleeping Beauty . " <p> She blinks at him , her tongue like gauze , the beginnings of a headache at her temples . <p> " You got a sunburn , " he says , and he reaches over and touches her skin , the soft place between her collarbones . " You 're going to feel that later . " <p> She laughs at the idea that she will feel something . Three days here alone , at a cheaper hotel across the street , and what she realized was that she would never feel anything ever again . <p> " Funny now , " Hank says . " Just wait . " <p> Clara probably will sleep with him . If their plane does n't fly them back to the U.S. tonight . He is hairy-back , stomach , chest . Too hairy . But otherwise unremarkable . <p> Hank leans closer to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Key West , " he says . " Right over there . Thirty miles and a world away . " His skin , warm from the sun , touches hers deliberately . " Want another drink ? " he asks , his breath sour . <p> " Yes , " Clara says . " Yes , I do . " <p> Hank snaps his fingers at a waitress and holds up an empty glass . " For favor , " he calls to her . <p> A shadow falls across Clara , and she looks up , into the green eyes of Francis , another stranded passenger . Francis is tall and slender and dressed all in white , like an angel . <p> " They just brought Paul a message from the airline . We 're not going tonight , " Francis says . Her voice has the hint of a Southern accent , of a girlhood spent in a hot climate . <p> The waitress puts a daiquiri down on the small table , and Hank signs for it . <p> " Oh , well , " Clara says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her mouth . <p> " You do n't need to get back for anything , I guess , " Francis says , studying Clara . It was what Clara did at the airport while they waited all morning , trying to figure out who these people were who she was stuck with . <p> " I 'm in between things , " Clara says . <p> Francis considers this . But Clara ca n't tell what she decides . " Paul made a dinner reservation in the dining room for eight o'clock . He wanted me to ask if you 'd be our guests ? " <p> " That would be nice , " Clara says without even glancing at Hank . <p> " The reservation 's under our name . Daniels , " Francis tells her . <p> Clara watches her walk away , across the long white expanse around the pool , her posture so perfect Clara would n't be surprised if there was a book under that white floppy hat . <p> " CIA , " Hank says . <p> " What ? " Clara gulps at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , making the name sound like a bad thing . " Definitely CIA . I can tell . " <p> " How can you tell a thing like that ? " <p> " I just can . He 's here checking something out . Maybe keeping that plane grounded . Maybe keeping an eye on us . " <p> Clara laughs . " That 's ridiculous , " she says . <p> She tries to find Francis and her husband among the people lounging by the pool , but they seem to have vanished . Clara frowns . <p> It is July in Havana . 1957 . Palm trees sway . The ocean glitters under the bright sun . The sand on the beach is sugar , stretching white and hot before her . <p> Clara arrives at the restaurant fifteen minutes late . Hank was right ; her chest is burned brick red . She bought a tin of Nivea cream at the gift shop and rubbed it on her skin , considered not coming to dinner at all , the idea of small talk and rich food too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tuxedoed man to a table overlooking the ocean , which is dark and mysterious at night , the lights from Key West twinkling back at her . <p> Everyone greets her like she is an old friend . Hank is peppering Paul with questions . Does he come here often ? Does he work for Pan Am ? Does he know anything about Hemingway ? Clara hides behind the oversized menu , its cover a rich maroon velvet . Improbably , the food is French . <p> Francis begins benign chatter , the kind Clara used to know how to do . Now it only makes her sad , the way people talk and talk without saying anything . She lets Francis 's words float around her until she thinks she can almost see them dancing in front of her : girls , college , library , Long Island . The letters dance in front of Clara 's eyes . She orders coq au vin , a salad with lardons and chvre . She offers nothing . <p> But the evening is somehow pleasant . There is a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Francis and Clara order Drambuie to sip . <p> " It 's so idyllic here , " Clara says . " It makes you think this is really your life . Here in Havana , drinking Drambuie and hearing the waves come and go . " <p> " But it is n't your life , " Francis says . " You have n't said a word about yourself . Where you live . Why you 're here with Hank . " <p> Clara shakes her head . " We 're not here together , " she says . <p> Francis raises one eyebrow , a thin penciled line . " He seems nice , though , yes ? " <p> Clara shrugs . " Nice enough . " <p> She is about to tell Francis that she is here from Miami , a weekend escape turned into being held hostage by Pan American Airlines , when that same little girl walks by , still in her bathing suit . She does not seem to be with her parents . Clara looks around the candlelit room , but no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she nears their table , and Clara is afraid the girl will talk to her , that she wants something from her . Clara jumps to her feet , spilling Drambuie on the white tablecloth that their waiter had so carefully swept clean moments earlier . <p> " That child , " Clara says . Her heart is racing . Her sunburn throbs beneath the thin cotton of her dress . <p> " Child ? " Francis says , frowning over her cordial glass . <p> Clara sees that the child is , in fact , gone , scooped up by her parents , no doubt , while Clara panicked . <p> " A little blond girl in a striped bathing suit , " Clara says , searching the room . But indeed the child is gone . She sits back in her chair , relieved . <p> " This is no place for kids these days , " Paul says . He has a trim mustache , like Don Ameche . <p> " Why not ? " Hank says , probing , suspicious . <p> " Rumors , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hank looks at Clara , triumphant . <p> Clara glances at her wrist , as if her Timex were there instead of on her bureau back in Miami . " I think it 's that time , " she says . <p> Hank gets to his feet too quickly . " I 'll escort you . Maybe it 's dangerous for beautiful blond women , too . " <p> At the door to her room , Clara lets him kiss her , shoving his tongue into her mouth like a lizard trying to catch flies . She lets him grope her , his hands cupping her breasts as if he 's checking for their ripeness . It is n't unpleasant , but , even though earlier she 'd thought she would sleep with him , she is suddenly exhausted . She wants her Nivea cream , the cool bed , solitude . <p> When she gently pushes him away , he grins down at her . <p> " Tomorrow we 'll go with them to that beach they were talking about . Paul got a driver . We can eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pig , roasted in a hole dug in the ground . " <p> " Tomorrow ? " she says . Her lips feel bruised . " I 'm sure the plane will be fixed by tomorrow . " <p> Hank laughs , shakes his head . " Paul says no . He got another message . Mr. CIA , right ? " He leans into her again . He is a big guy , tall and solid . He places a hand on her cheek , strokes it tenderly . " What are you doing here all alone ? " he murmurs , kissing her neck . " It 's dangerous here . Do n't you read the papers ? Does n't your husband read the papers ? " <p> Clara stiffens . Her wedding ring , that thin gold band of hope , is back in Miami beside her Timex . <p> " No husband , " she whispers . She kisses him , hard , on the lips , then slips inside . <p> " Is that your little girl ? " Francis asks . <p> They are waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clara can see Hank and Paul outside , talking , heads bent . <p> " What ? " Clara says . The glare of the sun through the broad windows makes her eyes sting . " What are you asking me ? " <p> " From last night , " Francis says . Again her cool green-eyed gaze settles on Clara , making her uncomfortable . " The little girl in the restaurant causing trouble . " <p> Clara looks at a girl , six or seven years old , in a stiff yellow dress and white sandals , her brown hair pulled into a tight ponytail , and shakes her head . " Mine was only three years old . Blond . Playful . Not like this one . She was n't even causing trouble . It 's just that no one seemed to be watching her . " <p> A man in a seersucker suit and a woman wearing a lemony yellow dress and a wide-brimmed white hat call to this girl to follow them . <p> The lobby doors slide open , letting in a burst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver is here . <p> A jeep idles at the curb , and beside it is a man in a straw hat and white cotton pants and shirt . His dark mustache an open parenthesis around his mouth . <p> " This is Ricardo , " Paul says , his voice holding a tone of intimacy . <p> Hank hears this , too . " An old friend ? " he says . <p> Ricardo and Paul both laugh . " A new friend , " Ricardo says . " We know each other , what ? Five minutes ? " <p> Hank 's eyes narrow , but he just nods at them . Since last night , he has been more possessive of Clara , as if they did sleep together . At breakfast , he sat beside her instead of across from her , even though they were the only two at the table . Now , he places his hand firmly on the small of her back , drawing her close . Clara gets the impression that Francis notices these small new intimacies . Perhaps she thinks there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front seat , and Ricardo helps Francis into the back . When he reaches for Clara 's hand to help her up , Hank takes her by the waist and lifts her , easily . Despite herself , goose bumps rise on her arms . She settles into the middle , pressed between Francis and Hank , and tries to remember the last time she had sex . Her husband 's face is a blur , as if someone smeared wet paint . Their tiny turquoise house in Miami is also a blur . Clara closes her eyes , trying to conjure it , but all she comes up with is the hibiscus that bloomed right by the front door and the small triangle of a pool in the backyard , glistening a chemical blue . <p> Clara grips Hank 's hand to stop herself from thinking of these things-hibiscus and husbands and swimming pools , all far away now . Dark hair snakes up his fingers . He is tanned . He squeezes her hand and holds on tight . <p> " Why are you here ? " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's noisy engine . <p> " Stranded , " he says . " Like you . " <p> " No , I mean- " <p> " Business , " he says , looking straight ahead . His profile is like a face on a coin . <p> " And your wife ? " <p> He turns to her and laughs . " Which one ? I 've had two . " <p> Clara settles on the word had , and smiles at him . " A lothario , " she says . <p> " Whoa , " Hank says . " Listen to that vocabulary . " He raises her hand to his lips and kisses it . <p> Clara feels Francis watching , and squirms away from his grasp . <p> Havana is behind them , and all Clara can see is fields of sugar cane , endless fields . Ahead of them are mountains . Somewhere is the ocean , but she is turned around , disoriented . <p> " Not like Miami , is it ? " Francis asks her . <p> Clara frowns . Had she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at dinner ? <p> Francis leans across Clara slightly and says to Hank , " No sugar cane in Arlington , that 's for sure . " <p> He laughs . " No ocean . No mountains . No nothing except lots of hot air . " <p> " I thought you lived in Long Island , " Clara says to Francis . <p> Francis 's face does not change at all . " No , no . Hank is practically our neighbor . In Virginia . " <p> Something feels wrong . That is for certain . Clara knows to trust this instinct of hers . She thinks back to that day in Miami , how she moved around the boxy kitchen with its happy yellow walls and shiny appliances . The smell of cleaning solution burned her nose , masked the softer smell of her first key lime pie . That feeling . Everything looked right . All that sunshine . Everything in place . But that feeling gnawing at her . <p> The jeep swerves sharply , throwing Clara against Hank . She feels the dampness under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's an SOB , " Hank says , laughing and putting his arm around Clara . " A slide over babe . " <p> They bump along a dirt road and then swerve again . This time , up ahead , Clara sees the ocean . It is as if they have driven to the end of the world . <p> On the beach is an open air hut , and people sit on benches drinking beer from the bottle . As they climb from the jeep and move toward the hut , Hank keeps his arm around Clara . Smells surround her-salt , sea , meat cooking , spices she can not name . In the sand , children build castles . Older ones kick a soccer ball around , barefooted . <p> Paul and Ricardo talk in Spanish to a man sweating over a pit with smoke rising from it . Hank pulls Clara closer still , bends down , and kisses her on the mouth . <p> " Maybe we 'll be grounded here for weeks . Or months , " he whispers to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meaning it . To drift from place to place in the arms of strangers . To have no responsibility . To be anonymous . <p> " Have you done something bad ? " Hank is asking her . He has her face in his large hands . <p> " Yes , " she says . " Too bad to say out loud . " <p> When they return to the hotel , it is dark , and Clara can smell rain . She is full of roasted pig and fried yucca and garlicky black beans and white rice . The hotel lobby is deserted , and their footsteps echo as they walk across it . <p> " Join us for an after-dinner drink ? " Paul asks . Ricardo has come inside , too , and stands beside Paul at the door to the lounge . A singer can be heard impersonating Pat Boone singing " Love Letters in the Sand . " <p> " No thanks , " Hank says . He does that thing again , putting his hand in the small of Clara 's back and leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sending goose bumps up her arms . <p> Clara glances over her shoulder to say thank you , but the three of them have walked away , not into the lounge but back outside . They are climbing into the jeep again . <p> " Where are they going ? " she asks Hank . <p> " To plot a coup , " he says . " To help overthrow Batista . " <p> The elevator door swooshes open , and when they step inside Hank begins to kiss her before they slide shut . <p> " You 're scaring me , " Clara says . " Talking like that . " <p> He eats her questions with his mouth . The doors open onto the twelfth floor ; his room . He does n't bother to turn on the lights . Instead , they are tearing at each other , pulling off clothes . Clara hears her zipper break , the small tear of fabric . And then he is pushing down onto the bed , and she is not numb . She is feeling him . His hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something is moving deep inside her . It is fear . It is anger . It is grief . This man , this stranger , is opening her up , and when she hears a scream she is not even certain if it is pain or pleasure . But she knows it has come from her . <p> The sound of rain pelting the window wakes her up . It is still dark . She can smell Hank , the aftermath of sex , her own body . Clara goes to the window and sees a violent storm ripping Havana . The palm trees bend angrily , wind sends things swirling , then smashing to the ground . Clara gropes on the floor for her dress and puts it on , the broken zipper gaping open in the middle , and walks quietly out of the room . <p> The hotel is dark and empty . She leaves the elevator , the lobby , and goes outside , by the pool . Chairs left there have upturned in the wind . Hard rain slaps her face , the wind tangles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet running away from her . But it is only the wind , she decides . <p> Her eyes catch a flash of pink and yellow across the pool . Clara peers into the darkness , trying to see what is there . <p> " Hello ? " she calls . She thinks of coups and assassinations , of things she can not understand . " Hello ? " she calls again . That feeling has returned , lodged in her stomach . Something is wrong . <p> Then she hears it , clearly . A child laughing . The splash of water . Is that a blond head by the pool 's edge ? Her mouth has gone dry , and she can feel her heart banging against her ribs . <p> As clear as if she is standing at a kitchen window on a bright sunny morning in Miami , Clara sees that little girl bent over the pool , scooping water into her blue plastic pail . Does n't that child 's mother watch her ? Clara 's brain screams . Then she is screaming . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susannah ! " She says : " Susannah ! " <p> But it is too late . <p> Strong arms wrap around her from behind . Hank is there , he is trying to calm her . He is telling her to come inside . It is a tropical storm . There is danger in it . She lets herself relax into his embrace . <p> Guilt is a thing you can not hide from . She will always go back to that one moment , when she turned her attention to a key lime pie recipe and away from her life . <p> " We 're stuck here for a while , " Hank is telling her . <p> Water pours down their faces and arms . They should go inside . But they stand there , in the middle of the storm . Clara lifts her face upward , toward the dark sky . She hears the wind howling . She raises her arms , the way a child does when she wants to be picked up , but she remains there , bare feet on wet tile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
