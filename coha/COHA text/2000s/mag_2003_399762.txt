// Editor 's Note As world economies integrate and enhance productivity with technology , look for sustained growth in the developed world over the next five years , as well as increased concern for the health of the planet and its populations . These are among the key trends shaping the world of the next two decades and beyond , which have been tracked for four decades by Forecasting International Ltd. president Marvin J. Cetron and his long-time collaborator , science writer Owen Davies . This article ( and its companion , to be published in the next issue ) updates the special report published by the World Future Society in 2001 . Part I focuses on general economic trends , social and demographic changes , and trends in energy and the environment . For each trend , the authors also offer a succinct conclusion about its implications for decision makers . General Long-Term Economic and Societal Trends * The economy of the developed world will continue to grow for at least the next five years . Any interruptions will be relatively short-lived . * Less than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebounding strongly , with rises in personal income , consumer spending , retail sales , and industrial production . In the hard-hit tech sector , production was up fully 6% between May and June 2002 . This is remarkably good news for an economy that pessimists feared would be on the ropes . Photograph Euros unite Europe , gaining parity with U.S. dollar . // * Real estate has proved to be extraordinarily resilient in the United States , thanks to the lowest mortgage rates in the last 40 years . Record-breaking housing sales included many middle-income buyers , as well as large numbers from minority groups who traditionally have not participated strongly in this market . * As other countries bring their economies under control over the next two or three years , growth will accelerate to something near the comfortable levels seen in recent years . * With national debts under control throughout most of Europe , the euro has risen to parity against the U.S. dollar for the first time since the European Union floated its joint currency . * The outlook for Europe remains mixed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobility to the labor force . This is making for a more efficient business environment on the Continent . * According to the most recent figures , Japan 's long-suffering economy is growing for the first time in years . Japan 's central bank is working hard to lower the value of the yen on international markets , in hope of promoting exports and ensuring continued growth . * This may be just the beginning for Japan . The banks ' write-off of bad debts , coupled with better lending practices and other reforms , could set the stage for a long  --  awaited economic recovery in 2005 . This would make Japan a much healthier trading partner for the West . * In November 2001 , China finally was admitted to the World Trade Organization . Among other beneficial mandates , this requires Beijing to cut away the obstacles that prevent small exporters from competing profitably in this potentially enormous market . As these reforms take effect , they will provide a welcome stimulus to the American economy . * Many nations of the former Soviet Union are bringing order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from western Europe . Recently , even Russia appears to be stabilizing its economy , long the weakest link in its region . The discovery of oil in Kazakhstan and new interest in other countries in the region as potential partners in the war on terrorism should further this process . * Worldwide , improved manufacturing technology will continue to boost productivity and reduce the unit cost of goods . At the same time , workers who remain on the job longer will offset slow growth in the labor force , while the globalization of business will keep pressure on salaries in the developed countries . Thus , both prices and wages should remain under control . * However , there is one new trouble spot . The Brazilian economy-a mainstay of the Latin American region-had been much more resilient than some onlookers feared two years ago . Recently , that picture changed . Word that the Worker 's Party candidate was in the lead for the Brazilian presidency drove the real to record lows on the global currency markets before the October 2002 election , while stock and bond markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IMF will withdraw their support suggest that the largest economy in South America could soon follow Argentina into default . Implications : The current economic downturn is very likely to prove relatively short-lived . It will be followed by generally solid growth throughout the developed world for the remainder of this decade . Photograph Seniors are served a hot meal by a group of volunteers . People throughout the developed world are living longer . // Economic unification will boost all manner of trade within Europe . In the long run , the newly capitalist lands of the former Soviet Union should be among the fastest growing new markets . In the longer term , India will expand faster than any other market in the world . Labor markets will remain tight , particularly in skilled fields . This calls for new creativity in recruiting , benefits , and perks , especially profit sharing . This hypercompetitive business environment demands new emphasis on rewarding speed , creativity , and innovation within the workforce . The growing concentration of wealth among the elderly , who as a group already are comparatively well-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorer old . This implies a loss of purchasing power among much of the population ; in time , it could partially offset the forces promoting economic growth . The world 's population will double in the next 40 years . * The greatest fertility is found in those countries least able to support their existing populations . Countries with the largest population increases between 2000 and 2050 include Palestinian territory ( 217% ) , Niger ( 205% ) , Yemen ( 168% ) , Angola ( 162% ) , the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( 161% ) , and Uganda ( 133% ) . * Even these estimates may be much too low . According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) , most official projections underestimate both fertility and future gains in longevity . * In contrast to the developing world , many industrialized countries will see fertility rates below the replacement level and hence significant declines in populations , excluding the effects of immigration . This means that the population of the developed nations will fall from 23% of the total world population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2050. * In 10 years or so , the workforce in Japan and much of Europe will shrink by 1% per year . By the 2030s , it will contract by 1.5% annually . Implications : Rapid population growth will reinforce American dominance of the global economy , as the European Union falls to third place behind the United States and China . To meet human nutritional needs over the next 40 years , global agriculture will have to supply as much food as has been produced during all of human history . Unless fertility in the developed lands climbs dramatically , either would-be retirees will have to remain on the job , or the industrialized nations will have to encourage even more immigration from the developing world . The third alternative is a sharp economic contraction and loss of living standards . Barring enactment of strict immigration controls , rapid migration will continue from the Southern Hemisphere to the North , and especially from former colonies to Europe . A growing percentage of job applicants in the United States and Europe will be recent immigrants from developing countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies throughout the developed world . Germany , Britain , and other lands traditionally welcoming to refugees and other migrants already are experiencing strong backlashes against asylum-seekers * The population of the developed world is living longer . * Each generation lives longer and remains healthier than the last . Since the beginning of the twentieth century , every generation in the United States has lived three years longer than the previous one . An 80-year  --  old in 1950 could expect 6.5 more years of life ; today 's 80-year-olds are likely to survive 8.5 more years . * Life expectancy in Australia , Japan , and Switzerland is now over 75 years for males and over 80 for females . * A major reason is the development of new pharmaceuticals and medical technologies , which are making it possible to prevent or cure diseases that would have been fatal to earlier generations . In many developed countries , credit also goes to government health programs , which have made these treatments available to many or all residents . In the developing lands , a primary cause is the availability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make health affordable even for the poor . // Rising Life Expectancy in Developed World // Global Aging // * These figures are much too conservative because they assume that life expectancy will grow more slowly in the future , argues CSIS. * Medical advances that slow the fundamental process of aging now seem to be within reach . They could well help today 's middle-aged baby boomers live far longer than even CSIS anticipates today . * Any practical extension of the human life span will prolong health as well and will reduce the incidence of late-life disorders such as cancer , heart disease , arthritis , and possibly Alzheimer 's disease . Implications : Global demand for products and services aimed at the elderly can only grow quickly in the coming decades . Developed countries may face social instability as a result of competition for resources between retirement-age boomers and their working-age children and grandchildren . In the United States and other developed countries , public spending on retirement benefits could grow to one-fourth of GDP by 2050 , even as the number of workers available to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic advances in geriatric medicine , the cost of health care is destined to skyrocket throughout the developed lands . This could create the long-expected crisis in health-care financing and delivery . However , dramatic advances in geriatric medicine are all but inevitable . Paying the high cost of new drugs and technologies will reduce the cost of caring for patients who would have suffered from disorders eliminated or ameliorated by new therapies . In the end , cost increases and reductions should just about balance out , leaving the average American health-care bill nearly unchanged . * The elderly population is growing dramatically throughout the world . * People over 65 made up only 8% of the population in the developed world in 1950 , but 15% in 2000 , and will grow to 27% of the population in the next half century , according to CSIS. * Throughout the developed world , population growth is fastest among the elderly . In Europe , the United States , and Japan , the aged also form the wealthiest segment of society . * The world 's over-60 population will reach 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three  --  fourths will be in developing countries , principally China , India , Brazil , Indonesia , and Pakistan . * In Germany , the retirement-age population will climb from under 16% of the population in 2000 to nearly 19% in 2010 and 31% in 2050. * Japan 's over-65 population made up 17% of the total in 2000 and is projected to rise to 22% in 2010 and nearly 37% in 2050 . Implications : Not counting immigration , the ratio of working-age people to retirees needing their support will drop dramatically in the United States , Germany , Italy , Russia , and Japan by 2050 . This represents a burden on national economies that will be difficult to sustain under current medical and social security systems . The United States in particular will need more doctors specializing in diseases of the elderly-at least double the 9,000 now available . Yet , by 2030 , the number of certified American geriatric specialists is expected to decline dramatically . The nursing shortage is another problem that is severe today and will grow much worse as the senior population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short 515,000 nurses by 2020 , just as senior baby boomers begin to flood the health-care system . State health-care agencies will be forced to take the lead in recruiting new workers to this critical field . * The growth of the information industries is creating a knowledge-dependent global society . * Information is the primary commodity of more and more industries . * By 2005 , 83% of American management personnel will be knowledge workers . Europe and Japan are not far behind . * The Internet makes it possible for small businesses throughout the world to compete for market share on an even footing with industry leaders . * In the United States , the " digital divide " seems to be disappearing . In early 2000 , a poll found that , where half of white households owned computers , so did fully 43% of African-American households , and their numbers were growing rapidly . Hispanic households continued to lag behind , but their rate of computer ownership was expanding as well . Photograph Hispanic family bridges the digital divide , though Hispanics continue to lag behind other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work : Future workstations will streamline technologies into sleek , multipurpose devices . // * By 2005 , the average PC workstation will combine a computer , a fax , a picture phone , and a duplicator-possibly in one unit-for less than $2,500 ( in 1995 dollars ) . The picture will appear on a flat screen of 20 inches by 30 inches . By 2006 or so , these systems will include real-time voice translation , so that conversations originating in one of seven or eight common languages can be heard in any of the others . * Computer competence will approach 100% in U.S. urban areas by 2005 . Cities in Europe and Japan will achieve universal computer literacy shortly thereafter . Implications : Knowledge workers are generally better paid than lessskilled workers , and their proliferation is raising overall prosperity . Even entry-level workers and those in formerly unskilled positions require a growing level of education . For a good career in almost any field , computer competence is mandatory . This is one major trend raising the level of education required for a productive role in today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training is becoming one of the most desirable benefits any job can offer . New technologies create new industries , jobs , and career paths , which can bring new income to developing countries . An example is the transfer of functions such as technical support in the computer industry to Asian divisions and service firms . * Growing acceptance of cultural diversity , aided by the unifying effect of mass media , is promoting the growth of a truly integrated global society . However , this is subject to local interruptions and reversals . * Information technologies promote long-distance communication as people hook up with the same commercial databases and computer networks , and above all with the Internet. * Within the United States and Europe , regional differences , attitudes , incomes , and lifestyles are blurring as business carries people from one area to another . * Intermarriage also continues to mix cultures geographically , ethnically , socially , and economically . * Minorities are beginning to exert more influence over national agendas as the growing number of African Americans , Hispanics , and Asians in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former " guest workers " throughout Europe . * In the United Kingdom , 21% of young adults answering a recent poll viewed themselves as primarily European rather than British . Some 31% of French Gen X'ers , 36% of Germans , and 42% of Italians also said they thought of themselves as primarily European . * However , in many countries there are powerful reactions against these changes . The growth of the German neo-Nazi movement is one obvious example . Implications : Over the next half century , growing cultural exchanges at the personal level will help to reduce some of the conflict that plagued the twentieth century . However , this is likely to produce a violent backlash in societies where xenophobia is common . Some of the most fervent " culturist " movements will spring from religious fundamentalism . Would-be dictators and strongmen will use these movements to promote their own interests , ensuring that ethnic , sectarian , and regional violence will remain common . Terrorism especially will be a continuing problem . Companies will hire ever more minority workers and will be expected to adapt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of accommodating foreign-born residents will continue to fall on employers , who must make room for their languages and cultures in the workplace . However , the greatest responsibility will continue to fall on two public institutions : schools and libraries . Primary concerns for U.S. schools include providing all students with a solid grounding in English and finding ways to recruit and reward the best teachers and weed out the least effective . Public libraries act as sites for after-hours learning , reference facilities , sources of Net access for those who do not have it at home , and bad-weather shelters for the homeless . They , too , require greater support . * The global economy is growing more integrated . * Rather than paying salaries and benefits for activities that do not contribute directly to the bottom line , companies are farming out secondary function to suppliers , service firms , and consultants , which increasingly are located in other countries . Photograph Youth on the move in Italy . Younger generations increasingly have more in common with their counterparts around the world than they do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , relaxation of border and capital controls and the use of a common currency are making it still easier for companies to farm out support functions throughout the Continent . * The Internet and cable-TV home shopping channels have brought retailers and manufacturers closer to distant customers , who had been out of reach . This is reshaping distribution patterns in many retail industries . * New procurement regulations and standards promise to open the government market to suppliers who previously found the bidding process too difficult , costly , or just confusing . Implications : Demand for personnel in distant countries will increase the need for foreign-language training , employee incentives suited to other cultures , aid to executives going overseas , and the many other aspects of doing business in other countries . As eastern Europe integrates more fully with the European Union , a major investment in personnel development will be needed over the next few years . The growth of commerce on the Internet makes it possible to shop globally for raw materials and supplies , thus reducing the cost of doing business . In niche markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compete with giants worldwide with relatively little investment . In the wake of the " Asian flu , " Western companies may have to accept that proprietary information will be shared , not just with their immediate partners in Asian joint ventures , but with other members of the partners ' trading conglomerates . In high technology and aerospace , that may expose companies to extra scrutiny , due to national-security concerns . Trends in Values , Concerns , and Lifestyles * Societal values are changing rapidly . * Industrialization raises educational levels , changes attitudes toward authority , reduces fertility , alters gender roles , and encourages broader political participation . This process is just beginning throughout the developing world , point out social researchers Ronald Inglehart and Wayne E. Baker ( THE FUTURIST , March-April 2001 ) . * Developed societies will increasingly take their cue from generations X and dot-com , rather than the baby boomers who have dominated western thinking for most of four decades . This will tend to homogenize certain basic attitudes throughout the world , because Gen X'ers and especially dot-coms around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their parents . * In the future , both self-reliance and cooperation will be valued  --  self-reliance because we will no longer be able to fall back on Social Security , pensions , and other benefits ; cooperation because group action often is the best way to optimize the use of scarce resources , such as retirement savings . * Post-September 11 worry over terrorist attacks have led Americans to accept almost without comment security measures that their vaunted love of privacy once would have made intolerable . This continues a long-established tendency in the United States to prefer a greater sense of safety at the cost of greater government surveillance and intervention in their lives . * Once national-security issues lose their immediacy , family issues will again dominate American society , at least through 2008 : long  --  term health care , day care , early childhood education , antidrug campaigns , and the environment . * Narrow , extremist views of either the left or the right will slowly lose their popularity . Moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats will lead their respective parties . This trend has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third-party candidates siphoned votes from less  --  extreme main-party candidates . Many voters , feeling that a vote for an alternative candidate is tantamount to a vote for the major opposition , are likely to accept less doctrinal purity in their party 's representatives . Implications : The highly polarized political environment that has increasingly plagued the United States in the 1980s and 1990s will slowly moderate as results-oriented generations X and dot-com begin to dominate the national dialogue . Current accounting reforms are just the leading edge of a wave of stockholder protection laws and regulations that can be expected within the next five years . The demand for greater accountability and transparency will be crucial , not only in the U.S. business community , but also for countries that wish to attract international investors . * Young people place increasing importance on economic success , which they have come to expect . * Throughout the 1990s-effectively , their entire adult lives-generations X and dot-com knew only good economic times , and the current economic downturn seems to them a confusing aberration , rather than a predictable part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national level , but they both want and expect prosperity for themselves . * Growing numbers of people now become entrepreneurs . Generations X and dot-com are the most entrepreneurial generations in history . * In the United States especially , most young people have high aspirations , but many lack the means to achieve them . Only one in three high-school graduates goes on to receive a college degree . Many of the rest wish to go , but can not afford the high cost of further schooling . * Without higher education , expectations may never be met : The real income of high-school graduates has declined steadily for more than 50 years . In addition , more young people report no earnings-up from 7% of all 20- to 24-year-old men in 1973 to a relatively constant 12% since 1984 . Implications : This will prove to be a global trend , as members of generations X and dot-com tend to share values throughout the world . Gen X and dot-com entrepreneurs are largely responsible for the current economic growth in China , where they are becoming a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger generations dress and think like their American counterparts , not their parents . If the current economic downturn becomes unexpectedly deep or prolonged , members of these generations will find it difficult to cope . They will need guidance from their boomer parents and World War II  --  era grandparents , who have seen hard times before . This could trigger a move to rehire older workers cut during the downsizing of the 1990s , to restore or acquire the kind of institutional memory that helps companies meet challenges not encountered regularly . That in turn could create a generational conflict , as retirement-age candidates take jobs that younger workers feel rightfully belong to them . If younger-generation workers find their ambitions thwarted , they will create growing pressure for economic reform and deregulation . If reforms do not come fast enough in the developing world , disappointed expectations will raise the number of young people who emigrate to the developed lands . Disappointment also will drive underemployed young men in the developing world into fringe political and religious movements . This could cause a new wave of terrorism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vacationing , and travel ( especially international ) will continue to grow in the next decade , as they did throughout the 1990s . People today have more disposable income , especially in two-earner families . The number of Americans traveling to foreign countries ( excluding Canada and Mexico ) increased at 5% per year from 1981 through 1996 . Once current worries over the threat of terrorism recede , that growth will resume and will continue for the foreseeable future . * In the United States , domestic tourism rebounded strongly in the first year after the terrorist attack of September 11 , 2001 . Travel to gambling centers such as Las Vegas and Atlantic City was first to revive . Through at least 2004 , depressed Asian currencies will make it cheaper to visit the Far East . Photograph Cruising to a private paradise , with lush greenery and white-sand beaches , " imagineered " by Disney Cruise Line to complement the shipboard experience . Photograph Antitobacco ad campaign educates women on the risks of secondhand smoke . // Tourism will benefit as Internet " virtual " tours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover not only popular attractions , but also provide current , detailed information on accommodations , climate , culture , currency , language , and immunization and passport requirements . a Multiple , shorter vacations spread throughout the year will continue to replace the traditional twoweek vacation . * More retirees will travel offseason , spreading travel evenly throughout the year and eliminating the cyclical peaks and valleys typical of the industry . Implications : The hospitality industry will grow at a rate of at least 5% per year for the foreseeable future , and perhaps a bit more . Tourism offers growing opportunities for out-of-the-way destinations that have not yet cashed in on the boom . Cruise ships such as the giant , 2,600-passenger Queen Mary 2 ( set to launch in January 2004 ) , will continue to grow larger . * The physical-culture and personal-health movements will remain strong , but far from universal . * Emphasis on preventive medicine is growing . In recent years , most insurance carriers in the United States have expanded coverage or reduced premiums for policyholders with healthy lifestyles . By 2003 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A 2001 Harris Poll showed that about one-third of Americans ate at fastfood restaurants less often than a year before , citing health reasons . In a 2001 poll , 75% of Canadians reported having changed their diets in the previous year in order to improve or maintain their health . Some 20% had reduced fat consumption , 18% had cut back on sweets , and 11% had trimmed red meat . - However , this trend has not yet had a similar impact on Europe , and people in many countries of the developing world still worry more about eating enough than eating well . * Smoking also is in general decline in the United States . Only 21% of Americans smoked cigarettes as of January 2000 , down from 30% in 1983 . Financial disincentives such as higher taxes on cigarettes should produce further declines of 10%. oU.S. consumers are purchasing less distilled liquor . Exception : Younger generations have revived the once passe taste for mixed drinks , but have proved to be uncommonly responsible drinkers . Most limit themselves to one or two drinks with a meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Better health in later life will make us still more conscious of our appearance and physical condition . Thus , health clubs will continue to boom , and some will specialize in the needs of older fitness buffs . Diet , fitness , stress control , and wellness programs will prosper . Like tobacco companies , producers of snack foods , liquor , and other medically dubious products will increasingly target markets in developing countries , where this trend has yet to be felt . The cost of health care for U.S. baby boomers and their children could be much lower in later life than is now believed . However , Asia faces an epidemic of cancer , heart disease , emphysema , and other chronic and fatal illnesses related to health habits . As the nutrition and wellness movements spread , they will further improve the health of the elderly . The market for cosmetic surgery and Botox treatments-which may be more about appearing than being healthy  --  will continue to grow rapidly . 0 Consumerism is still growing rapidly . * A networked society facilitates a consumerist society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , delivery time , and customer reviews on the Internet . Marketers , of course , can also check the competition 's offerings . This may gradually halt the decline of prices and shift competition increasingly to improvements in service and salesmanship. * Consumer advocacy agencies and organizations will continue to proliferate , promoting better information-unit pricing , improved content labels , warning notices , nutrition data , and the like-on packaging , television , and the Internet. * Discount stores such as Home Depot and Wal-Mart , factory outlets , and food clubs will continue to grow in the United States , a trend that has just begun to spread to Europe and Japan . Implications : In the next 20 years , Europe and Japan can expect to undergo the same revolution in marketing that has replaced America 's neighborhood stores with costcutting warehouse operations and " category killers . " This will inspire social unrest in countries where farmers and owners of small shops have strong cultural or political positions . This trend also will spread to China , though it will run several years behind developments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and online stores can list virtually every product and brand in their industry without significant overhead , service is the only field left in which marketers on and off the Net can compete effectively . Branded items with good reputations are even more important for developing repeat business . The women 's equality movement is beginning to lose its significance , thanks largely to past successes . * Generations X and dot-com are virtually gender-blind in the workplace , compared with older generations . * Fully 57% of American college students are women . Among minorities , the proportion is even higher : 60% of Hispanic and two-thirds of African-American college students are women . * Women 's increasing entrepreneurialism will allow the formation of entrenched " old girl " networks comparable to the men 's relationships that once dominated business . * An infrastructure is evolving that allows women to make more decisions and to exercise political power , especially where both spouses work . One indication of growing dependence on the wife : Life insurance companies are selling more policies to women than to men . * More women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They also are gradually finding roles as combat soldiers . Implications : Whatever careers remain relatively closed to women will open wide in the years ahead . Demand for child care and other family-oriented services will continue to grow , particularly in the United States , where national services have yet to develop . Over the next 20 years , this may force American companies to compete on a more even footing with their counterparts in Europe , whose taxes pay for national day-care programs and other social services the United States lacks . In the long run , the need to work with female executives from developed countries will begin to erode the restrictions placed on women 's careers in Asia and other developing regions . Family structures are becoming more diverse . * In periods of economic difficulty , children and grandchildren move back in with parents and grandparents to save on living expenses . In the United States , onethird of Gen X'ers have returned home at some point in their early lives . * Growing numbers of grandparents are raising their grandchildren , because drugs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to care for their children . This trend is strongest in Africa , where AIDS has orphaned more than 12 million children . * Among the poor , grandparents also provide live-in day care for the children of single mothers trying to gain an education or build a career . * Vermont 's first-in-the-country law granting partners in same-sex relationships most of the legal rights formerly reserved to married couples took effect in 2000 . As of mid-2002 , California legislators were considering a civil-union law . Germany , the Netherlands , and parts of Canada all have such laws , and similar proposals have wide support in Britain . - Yet the nuclear family also is rebounding , as baby boom and Gen X parents focus on their children and grandparents retain more independence and mobility . Implications : Tax and welfare policies need adjustment to cope with families in which heads of households are retired or unable to work . Policies also need to be adjusted for those who receive Social Security and are still forced to work to support an extended family In the United States , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - temporarily displaced from attention by the antiterrorist campaign-will regain their status as hot-button issues for at least two more election cycles . Concern for other " family values " will return as well , but this time the debate will be shaped by the realworld needs of diverse families rather than the agendas of religious conservatives . Energy Trends * Despite all the calls to develop alternative sources of energy , oil consumption is still rising rapidly . - The world used only 57 million barrels of oil per day in 1973 , when the first major price shock hit . By 1999 , it was using more than 73 million barrels daily . Consumption is expected to reach 110 million barrels daily by 2020 . However , oil 's share of world energy consumption has begun to decline : It is expected to drop from 40% in 1999 to about 37% in 2020. - The United States consumed 19.7 million barrels of oil daily in 2000 , of which 10.4 million barrels came from net imports-up from 6.3 million barrels in net imports in 1973 . Domestic oil production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserves are tapped in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge . * OPEC will supply most of the world 's oil , with Russia the secondlargest producer . According to the U.S. Department of Energy , OPEC oil production will grow by some 24 million barrels of oil per day by 2020 , to about 55 million barrels per day . This is nearly two-thirds of the world 's total projected increase in production . There is reason to wonder whether this oil will be available to the United States , however . Saudi Arabia is likely to be taken over by a fundamentalist Islamic government similar to that of Iran ; if , upon the death of King Fahd , Osama bin Laden or one of his deputies seizes power , the new regime is unlikely to provide oil to the United States . Implications : Low oil prices in the mid- to late-1990s slowed development of fields outside the Middle East . It costs $10,000 to increase oil production by one barrel per day in most of the world , but only $5,500 for the OPEC lands . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like those seen in 2000 , to provide an incentive to develop new fields , such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge . ( Such sites could benefit from new drilling techniques that make it possible to extract oil with less damage to the environment . ) That surge in prices could occur within the next five years as a result of political changes in Saudi Arabia . If it does not materialize soon after the death of King Fahd , no major rise can be expected in the price of oil in the foreseeable future , keeping consumption steadily high . * Contrary to popular belief , the world is not about to run out of oil . * As a result of intensive exploration , the world 's proven oil reserves climbed from about 660 billion barrels in 1980 to more than 1 trillion barrels in 1990 . Despite consumption , they have hovered over 1 trillion barrels ever since . * OPEC officials claim that the 11 member countries can provide for the world 's energy needs for roughly the next 80 years . OPEC currently supplies about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oil available internationally . It will continue to supply most of the oil used by the developed world . According to the U.S. Department of Energy , OPEC oil production will nearly double to about 57 million barrels of oil per day by 2020 . Oil production outside the OPEC nations has not yet peaked . Existing wells and refineries are operating below capacity , and at least a few non-OPEC lands have enough proven reserves to justify building more . By 2010 , China , Russia , and Kazakhstan will be major suppliers-if political uncertainties in Russia and Kazakhstan do not block investment by Western oil companies . Implications : If the price of oil rises significantly beyond current levels , new methods of recovering oil from old wells will become cost effective . Technologies already developed could add nearly 50% to the world 's recoverable oil supply . However , proposed construction of ethanol plants to supplement oil supplies would be a wasted effort . Until oil prices rise significantly more than they are likely to in the near future , ethanol simply is not cost effective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ambitious program to replace oil with ethanol , which has proved an abject failure . Oil prices are likely to remain generally around $22 to $26 per barrel for at least the next five years . a OPEC 's current aim is to hold the price of oil at $25 per barrel , but doing so requires a unity of purpose that member countries have never been able to sustain for very long . The vulnerability of oil prices was reinforced in the months after September 11 , when they fell to just $19.88. * New oil supplies coming on line in the former Soviet Union , China , and other parts of the world will make it even more difficult to sustain prices at artificially high levels . The 20 most-industrialized countries all have at least threemonth supplies of oil in tankers and underground storage . Most have another three months ' worth in " strategic reserves . " In times of high oil prices , customer nations can afford to stop buying until the costs come down . Implications : In response to high ( by American standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic oil production and refining to increase the reserve of gasoline and heating oil . This stockpile would be ready for immediate use in case of future price hikes , as in the winter 2000 release from strategic reserves . This will make it easier to negotiate with OPEC . One upward pressure on the price of American gasoline : The Environmental Protection Agency 's " Tier 2 " regulations , which aim to dramatically reduce emissions of particulates and nitrogen oxides , are scheduled to take effect between 2006 and 2009 . Production of super-low-sulfur fuels mandated under the plan is expected to add about 4o per gallon to the cost of gas and 60 per gallon to the price of diesel fuel . Growing competition from other energy sources also will help to limit the price of oil . * Solar , geothermal , wind , and wave energy will ease power problems where these resources are most readily available , though they will supply only a very small fraction of the world 's energy in the foreseeable future . Worldwide wind-power generating capacity grew by 6,500 megawatts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 50% more than the previous year . Photovoltaic solar energy production has been growing at a steady 25% per year since 1980 . Photograph Wind Energy Improvements Wind power and other alternatives will compete with oil , keeping fuel prices down . // * Natural gas burns cleanly , and there is enough of it available to supply the world 's total energy demand for the next 200 years . Consumption of natural gas is growing by 3.3% annually , compared with 1.8% for oil . * Nuclear plants will supply 16% of the energy in Russia and eastern Europe by 2010 . According to the Energy Information Agency at the U.S. Department of Energy , shifting 20% of America 's energy supply to renewable resources by 2020 would have almost no impact on the total cost of power . At present , less than 5% of the energy used in the United States comes from renewable resources . Photograph Smoggy urban thoroughfare in Nigeria . Pollution may be responsible for as many as half a million deaths a year in sub-Saharan Africa . // * A new technique called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 2020 . Implications : Though oil will remain the world 's most important energy resource for years to come , two or three decades forward it should be less of a choke point in the global economy . Declining reliance on oil could help to reduce air and water pollution , at least in the developed world . By 2060 , a costly but pollution-free hydrogen economy may at last become practical . ! nvironmental Trends People around the world are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues such as air pollution , as the consequences of neglect , indifference , and ignorance become ever more apparent . * Soot and other particulates are coming under greater scrutiny as threats more dangerous to human health than sulfur dioxide and other gaseous pollutants . In the United States alone , medical researchers estimate that some 64,000 people each year die from cardiopulmonary disease as a result of breathing particulates . In sub-Saharan Africa , the toll is between 300,000 and 500,000 deaths per year , and in Asia , between 500,000 and 1 million people annually die of particulate exposure . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million people die each year from the effects of air pollution , about 5% of the total deaths annually . * Governments are taking more  --  active measures to protect the environment . For instance , after years of ineffective gestures , Costa Rica has incorporated about 25% of its land into protected areas , such as national parks . Photograph Water quality is a growing problem even in developed lands . // a An estimated 80% of logging in the Amazon basin is illegal . In 1999 , Brazil raised the maximum fine for illegal logging to more than $27 million and changed legal procedures so that the fines can actually be imposed . * In India , government policies consistently rate industrial development more important than the environment . Yet , in an effort to reduce air pollution , India 's Supreme Court has limited sales of new cars in New Delhi to 18,000 per year , less than one-fourth of the average previously sold . * In the United States , despite an administration generally considered unfriendly toward environmental causes , the EPA 's mandate to cut tailpipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has refused to ease or delay its even-tighter restrictions on auto emissions . Implications : Environmental policies will provoke a political backlash wherever they conflict with entrenched interests , as they have long done in the American West . However , the cost of not protecting the environment is too obvious to be ignored . Throughout most of the world , polluters and private beneficiaries of public assets will increasingly confront restrictive regulations designed to serve the interests of the community at large . Water shortages will be a continuing problem for much of the world . * One-third of the population of Africa and most of the major cities in the developing world will face water shortages , according to the United Nations . - The northern half of China , home to perhaps half a billion people , already is short of water . The water table under Beijing has fallen nearly 200 feet since 1965 . It declined by eight feet in 1999 alone . Water usage is causing other problems as well . For example , irrigation water evaporates , leaving minerals in the soil . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be salty ; by 2050 , 50% . Salinization already is cutting crop yields in India , Pakistan , Egypt , Mexico , Australia , and parts of the United States . * Pollution further reduces the supply of safe drinking water . The European Parliament estimates that 70% of the Continent 's drinking water contains dangerous concentrations of nitrate pollution . In the United States , there is growing concern that pollutants such as perchlorate , the gasoline additive MTBE , and even the chlorine used to kill waterborne pathogens may represent significant health concerns . In India , an estimated 300 million people lack access to safe drinking water , due to widespread pollution of rivers and groundwater . a Water quality is a growing problem even in the developed lands . In the United States , cities such as Atlanta , where the delivery system is a century old and poorly maintained , suffer frequent water-main breaks , which suck dirt , debris , bacteria , and pollutants into the water supply . There are an estimated 237,600 such breaks each year in the United States . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more frequent-even the norm-west of the Mississippi . * Contaminated water is implicated in 80% of the world 's health problems . An estimated 40,000 people around the world die each day of diseases directly caused by contaminated water-that 's more than 14 million per year . Implications : By 2040 , at least 3.5 billion people will run short of water , almost 10 times as many as in 1995 . By 2050 , fully two-thirds of the world 's population could be living in regions with chronic , widespread shortages of water . Photograph A boy picks through a garbage dump outside Manila . In some places , garbage never even makes it to landfills , accumulating in streets . // Water wars , predicted for more than a decade , are an imminent threat in places like Kashmir : Much of Pakistan 's supply comes from areas of Kashmir now controlled by India . Such problems as periodic famine and desertification also can be expected to grow more frequent and severe in coming decades . Impurities in water will become an even greater problem as the population ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , repair of decayed water systems is likely to be a major priority for older cities such as New York , Boston , and Atlanta . 0 Recycling has delayed the " garbage glut " that threat  --  ened to overflow the world 's landfills , but the threat has not passed simply because it has not yet arrived . * Americans now produce about 4.4 pounds of trash per person per day , twice as much as they threw away a generation ago . * In June 2002 , New York City abandoned its 14-year-old recycling effort for glass , plastic , and beverage cartons , which city authorities held was not cost effective . This cut recycling from about 21% of waste to an estimated 10% and sent an extra 1,200 tons of litter to landfills each day . By contrast , Seattle recycles about half of its solid waste . * Seventy percent of U.S. landfills will be full by 2025 , according to the EPA . * In London and the surrounding region , landfills will run out of room by 2012 . For household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In some other regions , simply collecting the trash is a major problem . Brazil produces an estimated 240,000 tons of garbage daily , but only 70% reaches landfills . The rest accumulates in city streets , where it helps to spread disease . Recycling and waste-to-energy plants are a viable alternative to simply dumping garbage . The United States has more than 2,200 landfills . Europe , where recycling and energy conversion are much more common , gets by with 175 . Photograph Florida manatee and friends , The chief cause of species loss is destruction of natural habitats . // Implications : Expect a wave of new regulations , recycling , waste-toenergy projects , and waste management programs in an effort to stem the tide of trash . It will , of course , begin in California . Existing regulations will be tightened and disposal prices raised in Pennsylvania , South Carolina , Louisiana , and other places that accept much of the trash from major garbage producers such as New York . Industrial development trumps environmental concerns in many parts of the world . In 1999 , Samachar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what significant problems face their country . Despite rampant deforestation , widespread air and water pollution , loss of biodiversity , and many other such problems , environmental degradation came in next to last among 10 issues , cited by only 1% of the respondents . * " A deep and abiding distrust of environmental imperatives has been cultivated in large segments of South Africa 's population , " due to years of apartheid-era restrictions that were often justified as environmental measures , according to a study of environmental business opportunities by Industry Canada . Some 70% of the energy used in China comes from coal-burning power plants , few of which are equipped with pollution controls . Scientists estimate that by 2025 China will emit more carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide than the United States , Japan , and Canada combined . * Acid rain like that afflicting the United States and Canada will appear wherever designers of new power plants and factories neglect emission controls . A 1995 study of 77 Chinese cities found that 81% suffered from acid rain . In India , an area the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other chemicals associated with acid rain . Look for this problem to appear in most other industrializing countries as well . Implications : Broad regions of the planet will be subject to pollution , deforestation , and other environmental ills in the coming decade . Diseases related to air and water pollution will spread dramatically in the decades ahead . Already , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is five times more common in China than in the United States . This is just a taste of future problems , and perhaps not the most troublesome . Even the U.S. government now admits that global warming is a result of human activities that produce greenhouse gases . It now seems that China and India soon will produce even more of them than the major industrialized nations . Helping the developing lands to raise their standards of living without causing wholesale pollution will require much more aid and diplomacy than the developed world has ever been willing to devote to this cause . Though species extinction may not be so rapid as once believed , loss of biodiversity will be a growing worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappear each year , up to 1,000 times the natural rate of extinction , according to the United Nations Environmental Program . * Eleven percent of birds , 25% of mammals , and 20% to 30% of all plants are estimated to be nearing extinction . - Throughout the world , amphibian populations are in decline , for reasons that , after more than a decade of intensive research , remain poorly understood . Coral reefs throughout the world are dying rapidly , again for reasons that are not entirely clear . Photograph Mapping coral reefs in Indonesia , where the economy loses up to $800,000 a year per square mile of damaged reef . // - The chief cause for species loss , according to University of Colorado scientists , is the destruction of natural habitats by logging , agriculture , and urbanization . Implications : Species loss has a powerful negative impact on human well-being . Half of all drugs used in medicine are derived from natural sources , including 55 of the top 100 drugs prescribed in the United States . So far , less than 0.5% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indonesia , home to one-eighth of the world 's coral reefs , more than 70% of the reefs are dead or dying . The Indonesian economy loses an estimated $500,000-$800,000 annually per square mile of dead or damaged reef . Researchers from the United Kingdom 's National Environmental Research Council Centre for Population Biology report that diverse ecosystems absorb more carbon dioxide than those with fewer species . Loss of biodiversity thus is a potential cause of global warming . Continuing urbanization will aggravate most environmental and social problems . In 2000 , some 2.8 billion people were urbanites , about 47% of the total world population . By 2030 , 60% of the global population will live in cities . * Between 2000 and 2030 , the global population will grow by an estimated 2.2 billion . Of this , 2.1 billion people will be added to the world 's cities . In the past , urbanization has proceeded fastest in the countries now industrialized . In the more developed countries , 76% of the population lives in cities ; in the developing lands , only 40% are urbanites . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The big are getting bigger . In 1950 , there were just eight megacities , with populations over 5 million , in the world . By 2015 , there will be 59 megacities , 48 of them in lessdeveloped countries . Of these , 23 will have populations over 10 million , all but four in the developing lands . * Natural increase now accounts for more than half of population increase in the cities ; at most , little more than one-third of urban growth results from migration . * Up to 1 billion city dwellers lack adequate shelter , clean water , toilets , or electricity . The United Nations estimates that these problems cause 10 million needless deaths annually . * According to the Worldwatch Institute , fuels burned in cities account for 75% of global carbon emissions from human activity * NASA scientists point out that urbanization also tends to put buildings and blacktop on the most fertile land , eliminating significant quantities of carbon-absorbing plants . * Urbanization also deprives surrounding areas of water : Instead of sinking into the ground , rain is collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray water , and then discarded into the ocean . In some regions , such as near Atlanta , water levels in local aquifers are declining rapidly because the water that once replenished them now is lost . * The United States is the one major counterexample to this trend . This automobile-reliant society built one of the best highway systems in the world and has relatively little mass transit , so more Americans live in the suburbs than in the cities . Implications : Cities ' contribution to global warming can only increase in the years ahead . As the world 's supply of potable water declines , people are concentrating in those areas where it is hardest to obtain and is used least efficiently . Deaths due to shortages of shelter , water , and sanitation can only grow . Epidemics will become still more common as overcrowding spreads HIV and other communicable diseases more rapidly . Since the growth is now due more to natural increase than to migration , programs designed to encourage rural populations to remain in the countryside may be misplaced .
