To most of us , blood , urine and saliva are just unsightly bodily fluids to be disposed of as quickly as possible . But to David Sidransky , they are valuable sources of biological information that can be mined for nuggets of potentially life-saving data . <P> Sidransky , a cancer specialist at Johns Hopkins Hospital , is particularly interested in what these fluids reveal about a patient 's risk of developing cancer . The best-known of today 's cancer-screening tests , the PSA for prostate cancer , is at most 70% accurate in picking up tumors . Sidransky is pioneering a new generation of tests that can detect cancer more accurately and at a much earlier stage in the progress of the disease . <P> It 's not an easy task , especially since doctors still do n't fully understand how a normal cell becomes cancerous . But the challenge of stripping cancer down to its essential operations was what originally attracted Sidransky to the field when he was a medical resident at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston . " Of all the diseases confronting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting from an intellectual point of view , " he says . " It seemed like something had to change . " <P> What that " something " was became clear in the past decade as scientists began to see at the molecular level precisely what pushes a normal cell to become malignant . As more and more genetic mutations were linked to various types of cancers , researchers could see patterns of genetic changes that permit cells to grow into tumors . If doctors could identify the steps that a cell has to go through to become cancerous , Sidransky reasoned , they might be able to pick up a budding tumor 's malignant imprints along the way  --  tracking cancer as it develops , from start to finish . <P> Rather than rely on indirect cancer markers like PSA , which have an unacceptably high rate of false positives , Sidransky zeroed in on DNA shed directly from tumors . Many solid tumors , it turns out , result from mutations in stretches of DNA that are repeated several times . Finding these abnormal DNA snippets in urine or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root . In a small pilot study of bladder-cancer patients , one screen that Sidransky developed picked up more than 90% of tumors  --  a hit rate that could revolutionize the early detection and treatment of bladder cancer . <P> It wo n't always be so simple , however . For one thing , some cancers leave bigger footprints than others . In the urine of a patient with bladder cancer , for example , more than half the genetic material could derive from the tumor , making detection relatively straightforward . The sputum of a lung-cancer patient , on the other hand , is much more diverse ; less than 1% of its DNA is traceable to cancer . Clearly , other genetic clues will have to be developed , and Sidransky is already tracking down several of them . The challenge , to his delight , never ends .
