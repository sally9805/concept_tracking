<p> Like an old and trusted friend , " Masterpiece Theatre " still drops around on Sunday evening with marvelous tales to tell . The series has graced the airwaves for 30 years now , and there 's nothing else quite like it - nothing else that routinely mines the great works of literature and then presents them with such brilliance . Other venues , like Hallmark Entertainment on commercial television , have more money and do their best , but the results are uneven . From the very first strains of the " Masterpiece Theatre " theme ( the Rondeau from " Symphonies and Fanfares for the King 's Supper , " by Jean-Jacque Mouret ) , the viewer is assured that there will be stories with clear plots , compelling characters , and something meaningful to say . The famous melody signals that the next one , two , or 10 hours will likely not be a waste of time - intellectually , aesthetically , or emotionally . I remember the first " Masterpiece Theatre " I ever watched : " Elizabeth R " ( 1971 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Elizabethan Age . Then " Upstairs , Downstairs " ( 1973 ) helped me understand my English grandparents . But it was " The Golden Bowl " by Henry James ( 1973 ) that has stayed with me all these years as a kind of moral touchstone for a TV drama . In that solidly creative interpretation of an enormously complex novel I saw what television could do that no other art form could manage : a kind of mini-epic that feels as personal to watch as anything you can read . " I think serial drama has an appeal stemming back to Homer , " says " Masterpiece Theatre " executive producer Rebecca Eaton . " Dickens wrote serial dramas for magazines . A fictional continuum can be reassuring and exciting in reliable storytelling week after week . It can be a group or family activity , but it can also be enormously fulfilling to engage in alone , to live with the characters , to enter into another world . A lot of people love that time travel . " One of the reasons " Masterpiece Theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guiding intelligence behind it . Executive producers on this side of the Atlantic ( Ms. Eaton and her staff ) and the other ( mainly at the British Broadcasting Company ) not only seeks out great stories that seem to " fit " the television screen , they are obsessed with the " mise en scene , " admits Eaton - the way the film looks , costumes , sets , flower arrangements , hair - all the details of composition and the emotional tone of the images . Then , too , the acting is usually top notch , the cream of the British stage . Remember Derek Jacobi as the title character in " I , Claudius " ? " These actors work in this kind of material all the time - in theater , film , and on TV , " Eaton says . " The English just do more period drama than we do because they love their history . " The acting and attention to detail are significant ingredients . But there are others . " One of the secrets is choosing the right books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a classic . There are books that are iffy for adapting to television , " says Eaton . " Moby Dick , " " The Scarlet Letter , " and " The Great Gatsby " have all been disasters on film . At the core , though , the secret is in writing the screen adaptations of the novels . Eaton explains that there was a time in the 1980s when even British television resisted doing costume dramas , disdaining them as " tea-time television . " Eaton says her team tried to interest the BBC in George Elliot 's " Middlemarch " and could n't . Eventually they went directly to Andrew Davies , one of the most respected television writers Britain . " He said , ' Yes , please ! ' It was a runaway success and started them up again with ' Pride and Prejudice ' and ' Moll Flanders , ' Eaton says . " Davies has a knack for making 19th- and 20th-century novels ultimately watchable . " Writers in England are honored in a way they are not in the US , Eaton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that 's not just a few powerful writers , " she says . " That 's true of many English writers . " Davies 's exquisite adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell 's " Wives and Daughters , " which will air in four parts on Sundays in April , is as wondrous as his " Pride and Prejudice . " He does not impose a 20th-century sensibility on his 19th-century heroine , Molly Gibbons , though his own vitality injects spirit and grace in his marvelous adaptations . " Andrew is a genius , " Eaton says . " He loves strong women characters . He has an ear for dialogue that is true to the language of the books . But he understands what is going on under the decorous surface . " For his part , Davies is enthusiastic about writing for " Masterpiece Theatre . " " I think it 's an excellent , wonderful organization , " he says . " Certainly from the point of view of the writer . The notes I got were : ' Be as faithful as possible to the original work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercials , that restriction does n't have to be considered in the writing either . " I 've done work for all the networks and the needs of the networks are different than for public television . PBS raises the bar a little higher , " says author Joseph Maurer , whose poetic adaptation of Willa Cather 's " Song of the Lark " premieres on " Masterpiece Theatre " this spring . " My marching orders were to tell the story honestly and truly , summoning Willa Cather and her vision , " Mr. Maurer says . " One of the hardest things to do , " Eaton says , " is to decide what size the film can be , should be . " In the case of Cather 's densely descriptive autobiographical novel , the decision went toward the essential story , when the young Mid-western girl becomes an opera singer , just about to spread her wings and fly . At one point in the story the girl is alone in remote Arizona , and she finds an ancient Indian pot . She feels a connection to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a marvelous scene . " She realizes that the women who made those things were the artists of their era , who communicated their love of life and their observations about life through these vessels , " Maurer says . " She ... makes the connection that the artist is a vessel attempting to hold life , which runs like water through the fingers . We do try to get our hands and our hearts around the things that matter . " Next for " Masterpiece Theatre " is a tragic tale of love and madness . Leo Tolstoy 's classic " Anna Karenina " ( PBS , Feb. 18 , check local listings ) focuses on the domestic drama in the story , Eaton says , rather than on the grand tragedy . Some critic 's may miss the large-scale story Tolstoy intended in this four-hour dramatization . But it is nevertheless riveting . The contrast between happy marital love and tragic , mad passion is inescapable . So are Tolstoy 's observations about the destructive nature of outrageous social hypocrisy .
