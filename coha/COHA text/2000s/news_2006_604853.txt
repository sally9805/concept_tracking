<p> ISLAMABAD , Pakistan  --  When President Bush visits Pakistan next month , he 'll find one of his strongest allies in the war on terror at a political crossroads : Everywhere Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf turns , there 's trouble . <p> To the north , unmanned U.S. aircraft have allegedly violated Pakistan 's skies in search of al-Qaeda fugitives , firing missiles at suspected terrorist sanctuaries , killing villagers and outraging the Pakistani public . <p> To the south , rebellious tribal militias battle his soldiers , even firing a couple of rockets at Musharraf himself and wounding one of his top generals . <p> To the west , pro-Taliban forces are resurgent along the border with Afghanistan . <p> To the east , arch-rival India is ignoring Musharraf 's peace proposals , apparently convinced that time is on its side in the dispute over divided Kashmir . <p> Musharraf 's problems are America 's , too . The former Army chief of staff who seized power from an elected prime minister in a 1999 coup is considered a staunch U.S. ally in the war on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does n't have to compromise with politicians . But Musharraf is learning that even a military dictator ca n't always get what he wants . <p> Pakistan 's political parties are enfeebled but not dead . Last month , for instance , Musharraf had to back off from a controversial dam project he had vowed to ram through despite political opposition . <p> Babar Awan , an Islamabad lawyer and official in the opposition Pakistan People 's Party , says , " Pakistan is not Burma , " referring to the Southeast Asian country , also known as Myanmar , that is run by a military junta . " We have proactive political parties . A military machine can not keep a country together . " <p> Musharraf ' has to go ' <p> A weakened Musharraf could find it more difficult to ignore anti-American public opinion , crack down on Islamic extremists and pursue terrorist suspects along the Afghan border . " The entire nation has become united on one issue : They do n't want him to remain president anymore , " says Haroon ur Rashid , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal . <p> It 's not clear that Rashid 's view is universal . Views in the Rawalpindi suburb of the capital are mixed . <p> Saleem Ahmed Siddiqui , 24 , says the country is fed up with Musharraf and that he 'll soon be swept away . Mohammad Tariq Butt , 21 , agrees : " He has to go because he is enemy of God and nation . All religious forces have stood against him , and soon he will be forced out of power by political movement that can not be stopped . " <p> Waqar Uddin Cheema , 56 , praises Musharraf for fighting extremism and separatism : " He is the only one who stood against these evils and did well for his country . " <p> Musharraf , who is expected to run in presidential elections next year , denies he 's in trouble . He told Indian television last month , " I am the strongest at the moment , politically . " <p> Muhammad Ziauddin , a columnist with the Dawn newspaper , says Musharraf can survive politically as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loses their confidence , he 's out , " Ziauddin says . No wonder Musharraf has given retired generals plum assignments : One is CEO of a state-owned fertilizer company . Pakistan 's former spy chief is education minister . <p> After Sept. 11 , 2001 , Musharraf abandoned Pakistan 's support for the radical Islamic Taliban regime in neighboring Afghanistan and enlisted in Washington 's war on terror in return for economic benefits such as debt reduction . Pakistan has shared intelligence with U.S. spymasters , pursued al-Qaeda suspects and allowed U.S. military forces in Afghanistan to be supplied from bases inside Pakistan . <p> The reversal always was controversial in Pakistan . The simmering discontent flared after a U.S. strike on a village in the Bajaur tribal area along the Afghan border Jan. 13 that killed at least 13 people , including women and children . In a tape released Jan. 30 , al-Qaeda 's No. 2 official , Ayman al-Zawahri , said he was the target and taunted the United States for missing him . <p> Pakistan 's official response was muted : Musharraf condemned the attack as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been informed in advance . However , he has continued to support a strong alliance with the United States . Monday , he praised cooperation , which is based on a demand that U.S. troops in Afghanistan receive permission before operating in Pakistani territory . " We have excellent understanding and coordination with the United States forces in Afghanistan , " he said . <p> The public , however , was furious . Thousands protested after the strike . <p> " The government is definitely facing a situation that is quite embarrassing , " says Muhammad Ali Durrani , a Musharraf ally and special assistant to Pakistan 's prime minister . " All the opposition is protesting on this issue . They are trying to score points against ( Musharraf 's ) government . " <p> India , Baluchistan loom <p> The furor has since died down , perhaps partially because Musharraf has repeated the ( so-far-unsupported ) claim that the Predator attack killed al-Qaeda terrorists . Plenty of trouble remains : <p> *Peace talks with India are going nowhere . The two countries have fought three wars in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kashmir . Their rivalry drew international concern when both become nuclear powers in 1998 . They have eased tensions by scheduling cricket matches and opening bus routes across their border . But negotiations remain stuck . In the interview with Indian TV , Musharraf revealed that he had proposed a form of " joint management " of the territory . The proposal represented a concession from Pakistan . " There is no reply , " he said . " That disappoints me . " <p> *The government is fighting insurgents in Baluchistan , a traditionally rebellious province along Pakistan 's southern border with Afghanistan . Baluchistan is rich in natural gas and minerals but gets little benefit from its wealth in resources . It is the poorest of Pakistan 's four provinces : Only 20% of Baluchs , for instance , have access to safe drinking water , vs. 86% in Pakistan overall . Now , the Baluch resistance is demanding control over its mineral wealth and a new port the Pakistani government is developing with the Chinese in Gwadar . <p> When the struggle turned violent last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what hit them . " Defiant , the rebels fired rockets at Musharraf when he visited Baluchistan and shot at a helicopter carrying a high-ranking Pakistani general , who suffered minor injuries . The incidents seemed to provoke the Pakistani military . The independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan sent investigators to Baluchistan . Last month , the group reported evidence of " indiscriminate bombing , " torture and killings by the military . <p> *Pakistan 's tribal belt along the Afghan border appears to be slipping further out of government control . Under U.S. pressure , Pakistan dispatched 70,000 troops to the Afghan border to hunt for Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaeda fugitives . The move broke a tradition of dealing with tribal areas through political agents  --  designated officials representing the government . <p> At first , the military scored victories against the al-Qaeda and Taliban militants who had found sanctuary in the area . However , the military 's heavy-handed tactics have antagonized locals . Militants have assassinated more than 100 tribal elders viewed as government collaborators . Musharraf 's critics say his government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut deals . " Their approach is unilateral  --  no dialogue , only bullets , " says Babar Awan of the Pakistan People 's Party . <p> " He has fought with the democratic people . He has fought with the religious people . He has fought with the Baluch people . He fought with everyone but the army , " says Amanullah Kanrani , a lawyer and legislator from Baluchistan . " A democratic government is under compulsion to negotiate with the people . " <p> Contributing : Zafar M.
