PHOENIX  --  Outfielder Matt Holliday came in to train in Arizona a week before pitchers and catchers were due at camp . He invited shortstop Bobby Crosby to join him for hitting workouts in the offseason , then had Mexican food catered into the team 's facility for his new Oakland Athletics teammates . Holliday also plans to move his family to the Bay Area for the season . <p> Those hardly seem like the actions of a rental player . <p> The three-time All-Star ponders that concept for a moment . He had spent his entire 11-year professional career with the Colorado Rockies organization and had deep roots in the Denver area , so he does n't exactly think of himself as a baseball mercenary . <p> But when Holliday rejected the Rockies four-year , $72 million offer last year , the likelihood he would switch uniforms increased dramatically , for the club was determined not to lose its best player and get only draft picks in return . <p> So while Holliday getting traded was n't a shock , the fact he now wears green and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huston Street and Greg Smith and outfield prospect Carlos Gonzalez . Holliday , 29 , is eligible for free agency after this coming season and is not expected to re-sign with the low-budget A 's . <p> " Whether I 'm here a year or 10 years , there 's a lot to be learned , and there 's a lot of relationships that can be made and friendships that will last , " says Holliday , who 'll earn $13.5 million . " Whether you 're a rental player or whatever you may want to call it , I 'm here to play and play well and to be a good teammate . " <p> The Rockies will vouch for that . Holliday was a popular figure in their clubhouse , one of the homegrown cornerstones of the team that made such an amazing run to the 2007 World Series . <p> His headfirst slide in the 13th inning to score the winning run in a one-game playoff against the San Diego Padres is one of the most memorable moments in Denver sports history , and Colorado first baseman Todd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to replace him . <p> Holliday 's task now is to put up numbers big enough for him to land a better deal than the one he turned down from the Rockies . He watched during the offseason as free agents who had counted on long-term offers found the market tanked and their value diminished by millions . Should the country 's economic meltdown continue , his earning potential next offseason could be curtailed . He says he can live with that prospect . " I do n't like to lose sight of how blessed I am to get a chance to play baseball for a living , " Holliday says . " Whether I get a really long deal or not , I ca n't complain . " <p> Coliseum 's confines not so friendly <p> But the economy is n't the only change Holliday is facing as he nears free agency . He 'll have to maintain his elite level of production while going from one of the friendliest hitting parks in the major leagues to one of the stingiest . <p> Based on the metric known as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venue , Denver 's Coors Field ranked first in batting average in 2008 . The Oakland Coliseum , with its expansive foul territory and the cold , moist air that keeps the ball from traveling well there at night , ranked 24th . <p> Coors also ranked third in ease of batters there hitting home runs ; Oakland ranked 14th . <p> Holliday 's career splits  --  a .357 average and .645 slugging percentage at Coors , compared with .280 and .455 on the road  --  have drawn skepticism about his ability to duplicate his performance elsewhere . <p> " I kind of laugh at it , " Holliday says . " If you look at most players , their home stats are better . You 're accustomed to the batter 's eye ( backdrop in center field ) , you 're accustomed to the batter 's box , the lights . I think it 's a little overblown . But it will be my job to prove that 's kind of a crock . " <p> While Holliday 's home and road splits are extreme , the Elias Sports Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's career span  --  major league players produced an on-base plus slugging percentage ( OPS ) of .768 at home , .738 on the road . <p> Regardless of where Holliday does his damage , the A 's are counting on his production , even if it 's just for a season , or less . The A 's in 2008 ranked last in the American League in runs scored , batting average , slugging percentage and on-base percentage ( tied ) . And that was the second year in a row they finished at least 10 games below .500 . <p> Moreover , they had spent the previous year moving established players such as Dan Haren , Rich Harden , Joe Blanton , Nick Swisher and Mark Kotsay in exchange for prospects , as they sought to rebuild the farm system . <p> There was no indication the A 's intended to reverse course until pulling the swap for Holliday , who averaged nearly 32 homers and 113 RBI the last three seasons and was runner-up in National League MVP voting in 2007 . <p> They also made an unsuccessful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought back old favorite Jason Giambi . <p> The heart of the Oakland lineup now boasts the big left-handed bats wielded by Giambi , Jack Cust and Eric Chavez , provided he 's fully recovered from back and shoulder ailments , sandwiched around right-handed Holliday . <p> The A 's ranked 28th in payroll last season . Holliday 's salary will be the highest in team history , trumping the $12.8 million Jason Kendall earned in 2007  --  and $5.5 million of Kendall 's salary was picked up by the Pittsburgh Pirates . <p> Paying a premium  --  in both salary and prospects  --  for a player likely to bolt after one year was a stunner . <p> " Shocked . Definitely , " Chavez says of his reaction to the Holliday acquisition . " I was shocked at the fact we gave up pretty decent prospects . It 's usually the other way around . " <p> Reducing pressure on a young staff <p> General manager Billy Beane does n't see the move as a change of direction , saying the team 's objective remains to rebuild and improve at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contending midway through the season , they can always trade Holliday before the deadline or keep him and get two prime draft picks when he signs elsewhere . <p> Beane thinks the enhanced offense will take pressure off the A 's inexperienced pitchers , the team 's biggest question mark as it attempts to challenge the defending champion Los Angeles Angels in the AL West . <p> Left-hander Dana Eveland , entering his second full season , has the most career starts ( 35 ) in a rotation that will probably include former reliever Justin Duchscherer , Sean Gallagher and Dallas Braden . Gio Gonzalez , Josh Outman and Edgar Gonzalez ( who also has 35 career starts ) will vie for the fifth spot , though one of the A 's highly touted prospects  --  Vin Mazzaro , Brett Anderson and Trevor Cahill  --  could break through . <p> " It was an opportunity to get a good player , one that still fits into the game plan going forward , " Beane says . " These young pitchers will be here , and I think Matt will , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will Jason . " <p> Holliday 's contributions might go well beyond what he does with his booming bat . He has worked on becoming a better left fielder , committing only three errors in each of the last two seasons , and last year doubled his previous career high with 28 stolen bases in 30 attempts . <p> Though Holliday 's power numbers took a dip in 2008  --  25 homers and 88 RBI in 139 games  --  he also drew a career-high 74 walks . " Even if you go 0-for-2 with two walks , at least maybe you score a run , steal a couple of bases or make a play on defense , " says Holliday , a career .319 hitter . " You can go back to the hotel and feel good about that . " <p> Holliday might only be an Athletic for a few months , but he spent part of the winter rubbing elbows with two of the franchise 's greatest players . He worked out with Giambi and reached out to Mark McGwire and received a hitting tutorial . <p> The team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power  --  from John Jaha to Frank Thomas to Mike Piazza  --  but those hitters were on the downswings of their careers . Holliday is at the apex , with a massive payday probably looming . <p> " Matt has the ability to make a huge impact , a lot bigger than any other hitter , " Chavez says . " It gives everybody in the organization from top to bottom a little bit of hope about this year . " <p> Find Documents with Similar Topics Help Below are concepts discussed in this document .
