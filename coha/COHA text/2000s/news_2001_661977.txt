A prison within a prison , the Special Unit lives up to its name . <p> Every man in the Alabama prison system known to have AIDS is confined here , a converted warehouse at the Limestone Correctional Facility . More than 200 prisoners - some frail and red-eyed , others fortified by bodybuilding - inhabit long rows of bunk beds in the unit 's main room , a cavernous , gray place as long as a football field . <p> To a degree unmatched in any other state , these men are systematically segregated round-the-clock and excluded from programs offered to other inmates . <p> Eating , sleeping , worshipping , arguing , taking medication , perusing law books , playing dominos - every part of their daily routine occurs within a fenced-in compound that is like a quarantined island inside the larger prison complex . <p> Inmates complain that living in such close quarters is stressful and unhealthy . The only privacy for each man is a drawer under his bed that he can padlock ; pneumonia is more common in the unit than in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But the segregation policy also has fueled a spirit of camaraderie and self-reliance . The men run their own substance-abuse and AIDS-awareness courses . They organize memorial services when fellow inmates die . <p> " We consider ourselves like family , " said Arion Davis , who started a 17-year sentence for manslaughter in 1994 . " At times , it causes tension . But we try to support each other . " <p> Davis and other inmates interviewed privately during a recent visit to the unit appreciate the efforts of their guards and medical staff to make life bearable , but they are bitter over their exclusion from educational and work-release programs that help shorten other prisoners ' sentences . <p> The inmates - ranging from first-time , nonviolent offenders to convicted murderers - struggle with the reality that there are only two ways out : fight off the disease long enough to serve your time or die . <p> " Keep us segregated if you want , but do n't keep us from the programs , " said Michael Merchant , jailed since 1999 on a drug conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from coming back here , if there 's no rehabilitation ? " <p> For nearly 16 years , Alabama 's AIDS segregation policy was under legal attack by the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups . Last year , the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal in which lawyers representing Davis and other HIV-infected inmates accused the state of unconstitutional discrimination . <p> State officials welcomed the ruling and have made clear they plan to stick with the segregation policy despite criticism . The goal of preventing the spread of AIDS among prisoners " outweighs the rights they may have to equal programming , " Department of Corrections attorney Andy Redd said . <p> Mississippi and South Carolina also segregate their HIV-infected inmates , but South Carolina offers them some opportunities to share programs with other prisoners , and Mississippi officials recently promised to do likewise . <p> " Alabama seems to be lagging behind in its understanding of how the virus is transmitted . Segregated religious services , segregated libraries - they 're not necessary , " said Patrick Packer , a public health researcher at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the AIDS virus also are isolated from other female inmates at the Tutwiler Prison for Women near Montgomery . Although offered parenting and substance-abuse courses , they have no access to educational and vocational programs provided the other women . <p> But Packer does n't expect any change unless state lawmakers suddenly see " what we 're doing is completely wrong and inhumane . " <p> Packer visits the Special Unit at Limestone regularly , and he 's impressed by the inmates ' resilience . " They 've transformed it from the place where they were going to die to a place of life and energy , " he said . <p> One example of their self-reliance is the inmate-run Substance Abuse Program , a six-month course open to 25 men at a time . The participants sleep in a bunk room separate from the main dormitory and engage in candid , sometimes confrontational group-therapy encounters . <p> The men began a recent session by standing in a circle , holding hands , praying for inner strength . Then , seated , they took turns stating their names , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspired , " said one . " I feel locked up , " said another . <p> That 's understandable . Though inmates have an outdoor exercise area in their compound , plus some tables in the shade for dominos or cards , they view the rest of the prison through a razor-wire fence that they rarely pass through - except when seriously ill . <p> In Alabama 's midsummer heat , the unit is ventilated by a battery of industrial-size fans , and the temperature is tolerable . But many inmates still spend much of their spare time lying on their bunks ; there are few mandatory activities which require them to rouse . <p> Three times daily , inmates line up outside the warehouse to get their medication through the window of a small nursing station . In the winter , inmates said , the wait of up to 90 minutes can be bone-chilling . <p> The unit 's main room includes the bunk section , two TV-viewing areas with rows of wooden benches , a barber chair , a handcraft area where some inmates build model ships , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room from which guards keep watch through windows and security cameras . <p> Prison officials initially struggled to recruit guards for the unit because of fears of contracting AIDS . Incentives , including a salary bonus and four-day work week , solved the problem , and many on the current 21-member staff have worked in the unit for years . <p> Capt . Wendy Williams , the unit supervisor , said the result is good rapport between guards and inmates . <p> Many inmates " are going to die here , because of the length of their sentences , so it 's almost like a death-row unit , " Williams said . " You ca n't just treat them like other inmates . They have special problems , and we try to pick people to work here who can take that into consideration . " <p> Understanding that many inmates have nothing to lose gives the guards a strong incentive for minimizing confrontations , she said .

" It behooves us to work it out . " <p> Ronald Hatcher is among the Special Unit inmates who knows the depths of despair . He received a life sentence for rape in 1989 , then learned he had the AIDS virus during the mandatory screening of all new inmates . <p> " When I first got here , I thought I 'd die in six months , " Hatcher said . " People were dying like flies . It was tough . One of my partners - I tried to wake him up for breakfast one day , he was dead . " <p> Gradually , improvements in AIDS medicines reduced the Special Unit death rate ; officials said three of its inmates have died in the past year . But Hatcher , 34 , says the lack of vocational programs and crowded living conditions still breed tension . <p> " We 're congested , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of envy . " <p> Initially sentenced to life without parole , Hatcher took a correspondence course in law and obtained a sentence revision so parole is possible . The Detroit native hopes his participation in group therapy and religious education programs will help him win release . <p> " The toughest part is keeping yourself focused , " he said . " There 's a lot of stress . " <p> Williams said most of the fights in the unit stem from relationship conflicts and she estimated that more than 70 percent of the men engage in homosexual activity <p> " We do n't condone it , but it 's a reality in this environment , " she said . " I play marriage counselor . I divorce them sometimes . You 're going to have lovers ' quarrels , and as part of maintaining control and security , you have to deal with it . " <p> The ACLU and other advocacy groups are trying to build grass-roots support in Alabama for reforms that would end the prison segregation policy or at least improve programs . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ACLU 's National Prison Project . " It hurts the prisoners , and it hurts the community , because they 're going out of prison in no better circumstances than when they went in . " <p> Williams agrees that vocational and academic courses - perhaps through computer-based distance learning - would be a welcome addition , but says there are n't enough resources for separate-but-equal programming . The state is grappling with a budget shortfall that has forced cutbacks in a wide array of programs and services . <p> " Money 's always an issue . We ca n't afford to buy the equipment , " Williams said . <p> Dr. Colette Simon , Limestone 's infectious-disease expert , agrees with her Corrections Department superiors that the segregation policy is sound from a medical standpoint . It not only limits the spread of HIV , she said , but also enables the prison to assign dedicated , knowledgeable nurses to work exclusively with the Special Unit men . <p> Nonetheless , many of the inmates and their families complain about the health risks of dormitory-style conditions . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon , who noted that pneumonia in the unit is more prevalent than among Limestone 's 1,900 other inmates . <p> Even when a seriously ill inmate is moved from the Special Unit , segregation continues . There are both private rooms and a group ward at the main infirmary designated exclusively for inmates with the AIDS virus . <p> In all , the atmosphere is daunting , even to an articulate , self-confident inmate like Keith Lewis . <p> Lewis has been in the Special Unit for nine years , serving a 20-year sentence for first-degree robbery , and hopes to obtain parole soon . Now 34 , he once studied business administration at Tennessee State University , but his leadership of the AIDS awareness program has convinced him he should become an AIDS counselor after his release . <p> He strives to keep busy helping other inmates , but shares the anxiety that many of them feel . <p> " Being caged up like this , there 's a lot of fear , " Lewis said .
