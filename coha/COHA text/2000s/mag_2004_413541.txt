Those of us who haul our boats every year are familiar with the yin and the yang  --  the good and the bad  --  of the start of the cruising season . They are the spring thaw and then the sinking reports . It 's heartbreaking to own a boat that survived winter storage but did n't quite make it to prime time . Fortunately , in the overall scheme of things , relatively few boats sink every year . That 's because most of us are careful and responsible maintenance-oriented boaters . The first boats to go down are usually found at the dock  --  dramatic representations of the poor winter storage preparation that was done the previous fall . I 've seen runabouts left in the water with their outdrives lowered . The drives got jammed in the ice and forced the boat 's stern down low enough to allow flooding . I 've also seen boats that were poorly covered . As a result , water that went from frozen to flowing could n't find its way out through debris-clogged drains . And then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea cocks were closed in the fall , but the corroded stem , unseen inside the housing , let go and the valve never did close completely . The ice popped the hose , and when the thaw came , the influx began . Failed sea cocks and/or through-hull fittings and their associated hoses are responsible for more sunken boats than anything else . There 's no such thing as a dependable gate-valve-type sea cock . I believe that proper sea cocks are marine-rated bronze from a chandler ( not a plumbing supply house ) or other marine equipment source , are positive opening and closing , and have solid bronze handles . Then there are the composite sea cocks . In my experience , they work fine under normal use , but I wonder about their efficacy when conditions are extreme . On two separate occasions , I 've had the handles snap off when I 've tried to close them  --  once in extremely cold weather and again on a sea cock that had n't been moved in about a year . Last year , I saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I began to move it . One hard run offshore and the owner would 've been on the inside watching the water come in . Sinkings are also more likely to occur during those early spring runs when the winds are gusty and the waters are still rambunctious . The most vulnerable boats are those that cruised calm summer waters the previous year without incident or breakdown . Since the owners of these boats believed in the " if it ai n't broke " theory , their craft received only a cursory inspection at launch time . With warming spring temperatures and without preventive maintenance , off they went . Here 's what is typically found when the sunken hulks are raised and examined : Cooling hoses , most likely ones that had n't been replaced in a few years , with sharp bends that caused weak spots , and had become susceptible to failure and leaking as water made its way from sea cocks to engine fittings . Hoses need the straightest possible run from fitting to terminal , and they must be chafe-protected wherever they contact bulkheads or stringers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooling systems , even though they may fit . Automotive hoses are stiffened by spiral wire between the layers of rubber . Those wires will eventually abrade and wear through . Proper marine hose is so marked and is never wire-stiffened . The hoses on those ill-fated boats are often single-clamped instead of double-clamped . And the clamps either are n't the all-stainless marine variety or they are the inexpensive type that are notched to take the worm-gear tightening stud through the whole band of the clamp . When those notched clamps are tightened , you 'll see parts of the hose squeezed through the notches ; that weakens the hose . The proper clamp is sized to the hose and is only notched so it can be tightened for that size hose . Other problematic areas include stuffing boxes and glands  --  where rudder and engine shafts penetrate the hull . They 're usually located in uncomfortable and hard-to-access areas , which makes it even more necessary to get down there and examine them . On older boats , the fastenings that connect the plates of the rudder glands to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be examined at every haul-out with an eye towards replacement . Another problematic area is the bolt-on connection between the transmission and engine shafts . Those bolts should be checked regularly and periodically tightened  --  it 's not unknown for them to shear with the consequent loss of the shaft . CAPT .
