Rugged canyons picked Treasurer 's tableland. // A vast sea once covered much of what is now the southeastern United States . For millions of years , sediments accumulated on the seabed and became compressed into layers of sandstone , limestone , shale , and siltstone . Then , between 310 and 275 million years ago , as the African and North American continental plates slowly collided , these layers of rock were squeezed upward to form the Appalachian Mountains . To the west , that same squeeze and uplift created a huge plateau , or tableland , which has since been dissected by river valleys . That tableland is now known as the Allegheny Plateau in West Virginia and Pennsylvania , and as the Cumberland Plateau from eastern Kentucky south through central Tennessee and northeastern Alabama . Before the tableland rose entirely above sea level , the waters covering it became increasingly shallow and a swamp forest moved into the niche . Generations of plant detritus accumulated in the swamp and eventually turned into coal . As the tableland continued to rise , the coal seams were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now lie about 1,800 feet above sea level . The coal has been strip-mined throughout much of the region , permanently scarring the landscape . But many rugged areas where the coal could not be readily extracted have been preserved . One such area is Savage Gulf , Tennessee , and it boasts some of the wildest topography to be found east of the Rocky Mountains . Viewed from the air , Savage Gulf looks like a giant footprint , with five deep canyons radiating from a central point . The canyons-or gulfs , as the local people call them-are each about five miles long and 800 feet deep and are rimmed almost continuously by sheer sandstone cliffs . Only at the Stone Door-a ten-foot-wide crack in the rim-can you make your way down to the bottom of Savage Gulf . Generations of travelers , going back to the Cherokee and Chickamauga Indians , have negotiated the rough scramble down to the creek-though in recent years stone steps constructed from natural rocks have made the descent into and ascent from the Gulf a trifle easier . Savage Gulf has been carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creek and Savage Creek . All these streams flow underground in places , though when the rain gets heavy , excess water is forced across the surface . Many miles of trails give hikers access both to the top of the plateau and to the streams below ; several trails lead to overlooks of scenic waterfalls . Savage Gulf is incorporated into the South Cumberland State Recreation Area , and because of its pristine condition , it has been designated a State Natural Area . The trees growing on the plateau face fairly hot , dry conditions , but the environment within the deep canyons stays moist throughout the growing season , in part because of the dense tree cover . Even though the Gulf forest has never been cut , the trees are rarely as majestic as some of those found in the coves of the Appalachian Mountains . The reason is that the sheer sandstone cliffs continue to erode , and cascading rockfalls break many young trees and keep others from developing into huge specimens .

Atop the plateau the dominant trees are white oak , northern red oak , chestnut oak , shagbark hickory , mockernut hickory , and pignut hickory . Others are white ash , basswood , black gum , sassafras , and witch hazel . Often perched along the Gulf rim is the common serviceberry , a tree whose inch-wide white flowers bloom in late March , just before the leaves expand . Flowering dogwood , mountain laurel , and rose-shell azalea dot the forest with splashes of color in early May . Common shrubs are farkleberry , lowbush blueberry , and maple-leaved viburnum . Wildflowers : fire pink , several kinds of blue violets , pink and yellow lady 's slippers , goldenrod , blue-stem goldenrod , blue asters , and bedstraws . Gulf forest . Tulip tree , American beech , sugar maple , umbrella tree , and cucumber tree dominate here . Hemlocks provide a beautiful contrast to the broad-leaved species . Wild hydrangea is the most abundant shrub . Peculiar , parasitic beechdrops grow on the roots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gains its nutrition from the leaf litter . Other wildflowers : Solomon 's seal , false Solomon 's seal , foamflower , bristly buttercup , prostrate blue violet , wild ginger , hepatica , dwarf iris , doll's-eyes , Indian cucumber root , largeflower bellwort , downy rattlesnake plantain , and several kinds of trilliums . Ferns : New York fern , lady fern , Christmas fern , broad beech fern , maidenhair fern , fragile fern , rattlesnake fern , spinulose wood fern , and rock polypody Streamside . Lining Big Creek , the Collins River , Savage Creek , and their tributaries are cottonwood , sycamore , red maple , and sweet gum , along with mountain laurel and white rhododendron . Beneath those plants are spicebush and the occasional possum haw , a deciduous holly . Cream violet and littleleaf crowfoot are common on the stream banks . Cinnamon fern and royal fern may appear in the wetter areas . Author Affiliation Robert H.
