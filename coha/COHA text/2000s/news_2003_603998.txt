<p> Kevin Garnett was trying to cope with another first-round exit in the NBA playoffs last spring when he learned that TNT analysts Charles Barkley and Magic Johnson had questioned the Minnesota forward 's ability to take over a game in crunchtime . <p> Garnett was taken further aback by team vice president of basketball operations , Hall of Famer Kevin McHale . In a one-on-one meeting , McHale told Garnett he needed to get more aggressive offensively and impose his will defensively . <p> The critiques by three of the 50 all-time greatest NBA players stung the perennial All-Star and one-time Olympian . His unselfish play , infectious smile and clean living always have been above reproach . But instead of getting angry , he got motivated . <p> " When Kevin made the comments and when Magic came out and made his comments , I felt like I needed somebody to be there for me , and they were n't , " Garnett says . " But you know what ? I said I 'm not going to worry about it . I 'll have tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' All right , these are the things I need to get better , ' and I took it that way . " <p> In the offseason Garnett hired a personal trainer and a nutritionist and took up yoga , a discipline that brought an inner calm . The end product : an MVP-caliber season , his best in seven years as a professional , and surfacing sentiment that he  --  not Kobe Bryant , Tracy McGrady or reigning MVP Tim Duncan  --  is the long-awaited next Michael Jordan . <p> Garnett , 26 , has even convinced his critics . " We felt like he needed to be more aggressive , and he 's been unbelievable , " Barkley says . " He has raised his level . He 's obviously the MVP , in my opinion . " <p> Now , with his improvement , Garnett says he expects Minnesota management to keep the team at a higher level as he prepares to move into the final season of his contract . <p> Da Kid  --  the teen who ignited the landslide of high school-to-the-NBA draftees in 1995 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all over that team , " says former star Eddie Johnson , a TV analyst for the Phoenix Suns . <p> The 7-footer with outside skills of a guard and inside presence of a center says he 's a " quiet assassin . I 've trained myself to go , like a soldier in combat . Attack . Attack . Attack . " <p> The MVP of the All-Star Game has taken the talent-shy Timberwolves and almost single-handedly put them in the hunt in the talent-deep Western Conference for home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs , a burden he embraces as a challenge . For now . <p> " It gets old , " says Garnett , who has one year left on his six-year , $ 126 million deal that triggered the current salary-cap agreement . " But that 's what I do . " <p> There 's growing statistical evidence that he has even taken over the league . <p> On offense he is putting the finishing touches on a fourth consecutive 20-point , 10-rebound , five-assist season that puts him in a class with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson , all among the NBA 's 50 greatest . On defense he routinely shuts down the basket . <p> " He 's like Scottie and Michael in their prime , " McHale says . " They could guard 1 1/2 people . " <p> A man of diverse interests <p> Garnett is sitting in the lobby of a Phoenix hotel during a recent road trip smiling . He loves his life , even when it comes under attack . " I go through life with a smile because I know things can be worse than they are . " <p> He lost his grandfather ( " Papa " ) 1 1/2 years ago , an aunt two years ago and one of his best friends , former teammate Malik Sealy , in a fatal car accident in May 2000 . Garnett honors his friend by putting his name and No. 2 over the locker next to him at home and on the road . <p> He might be an " assassin " on the court , but off it he is more like a puppy : frisky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road , he 's most at ease surrounded by teammates , whom he entertains with his storytelling at dinners . " He likes to spend time with the crew , " forward Joe Smith says . " We get a big table and sit for hours . He might be the best storyteller in the world . " <p> In Minneapolis , Garnett says he 's a " homebody . " He loves to shop and listen to music , but his biggest passion is the house in a quiet suburb he custom-built and decorated . This is where he entertains such groups as his Official Block Family  --  a dozen or so friends he grew up with in South Carolina who visit him regularly . <p> The house has a black-and-white theme . There 's an 11-foot mirror in the White Room , and white marble throughout . " I have diverse tastes , and my house is a reflection of that . " <p> Pictures are abundant . Recent pictures of family and friends and players he respects . Old pictures . The Cotton Club . The Rat Pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot of John and Bobby Kennedy in the Oval Office . <p> " It 's like , ' Wow , I wonder what they 're talking about ? ' " says Garnett , a history buff . " It 's either the Cuban missile crisis or about Marilyn . " <p> He laughs . This is Garnett . He 's simple , fresh , real , more into people than things . He is a throwback in a throwback home . <p> " He 's a classic , " Smith says . <p> On the court , Garnett is a throwback , too . He 's fundamentally sound , more into team than ego . " He 's one of the most unselfish go-to guys I 've ever seen , " Smith says . That , ironically , came back to haunt Garnett last spring , when the Timberwolves flopped in the playoffs again and Barkley and Johnson targeted him . <p> " USA Basketball was criticized a lot last summer ( after losing three times in the world championships ) for playing extremely selfish , " Minnesota coach Flip Saunders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't shoot enough . Because we did n't have success in the playoffs , he was criticized for playing the right way . " <p> Chase for the ring is paramount <p> The playoff failures eat at him : Garnett and the Timberwolves have been ousted six times in a row in the first round , 5-18 in that period . He knows that 's where reputations are made . <p> " My goal is bigger than the first round . The goal has to be the Western Conference finals and NBA Finals . If you think small , then small results come . I 've never been a small thinker . " <p> This is the player who rejected a $ 100 million contract before signing his $ 126 million deal in 1997 . The contract that pays him an NBA-high $ 25.2 million this season and $ 28 million next season before expiring . That will position him to land another mega-million deal that could rival shortstop Alex Rodriguez 's $ 252 million package with the Texas Rangers . <p> But Garnett talks like a ring is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a pay cut , he says , " To win a championship , I 'd give whatever . " His agent initiated negotiations with the Timberwolves for an extension last summer , but Garnett cut them off before the season began . As McHale challenged him , he has challenged McHale . <p> " You need a core to go forward , " Garnett says . " I 've lost everybody from Steph ( Marbury ) to Googs ( Tom Gugliotta ) to Malik to Terrell Brandon , but every year I 'm in the playoffs . In every situation , you want to make sure the situation is maturing as much as you are . I 'm loyal , but you have to ask yourself : Am I loyal to the point where I do n't get a ring and I 'm miserable and I 'm going out in the first round every year ? " <p> McHale accepts that , just like indications are Garnett is willing to accept less than the maximum starting salary of $ 29.4 million in a new contract . " He wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " McHale says . <p> And silence the critics once and for all . Barkley , Johnson and McHale apparently only unleashed the fury within Garnett . <p> " What motivates me these days , " Garnett says , " is the fact that I 'm not in a lot of the talks , the fact that a lot of people do n't see me as the best . The fact that sometimes I feel people in my own organization do n't see me as the best . That people think I ca n't do something . That people say I ca n't carry this team . That people do n't think I can get us out of the first round . The fact that I have n't won a ring . <p> " All those things drive me . " <p> Earning his stripes time <p> Kevin Garnett took to heart last year 's criticism of lack of aggression : He has been in attack mode all season , most evidenced by his steady parade to the free throw line . In his first seven years he went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting there 6.7 times a game . Where he ranks this season ( through Wednesday ) : <p> Free throw attempts <p> 1 . Allen Iverson , Philadelphia <p> 584 <p> 2 . Tracy McGrady , Orlando <p> 575 <p> 3 . Paul Pierce , Boston <p> 565 <p> 4 . Kobe Bryant , Los Angeles Lakers <p> 550 <p> 11 .
