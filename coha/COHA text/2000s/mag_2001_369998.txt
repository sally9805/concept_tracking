Want to give yourself a really good headache ? One of those **56;13026;TOOLONG affairs ? Try installing two brand-new operating systems on two different computers at the same time . Nothing causes cranial pain more quickly , as I discovered when I got my hands on the two pieces of software that will soon rule our lives : Windows XP and Mac OS X ( pronounced oh-ess ten ) . These are the next-generation operating systems for PCs and Macs , respectively . Windows XP , to be released later this year , is currently out in beta , a trial , bug-testing format . The debugged OS X is on store shelves now , which means it ties your brain into slightly fewer knots . <P> First the good news . Both systems are phenomenally stable and virtually crash free ( say goodbye to the blue screen of death , PC users ! No more freeze-ups for Mac fans ! ) . They 're also much nicer to look at than their predecessors . OS X wins the beauty contest with translucent menus and more gee-whiz effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its share of cool colors and eye-candy icons . <P> New computer users who buy machines with these systems preloaded should have a relatively stress-free experience . Microsoft and Apple have made navigation a breeze . They 've grouped control panels together in a way that actually makes sense , and both give you more options than you 'll ever need for arranging your files and folders . No , the headaches are going to come when veteran users install one of these beauties and then try to lead their computer lives as if nothing had changed . <P> You see , both systems are built on computer code never before seen by home users . That 's what makes them so stable . It also puts them in potential conflict with every program and peripheral device you own . In this respect , Windows XP is by far the worst offender . A few seconds after XP 's installation , the tiny piece of software that controls my high-speed Internet connection went on strike . That meant no e-mail , no Web and lots of hyperventilation . I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the external hard drive where all my MP3s were stored . And some of my favorite games went berserk , apparently because my machine had fallen out with its own graphics card . <P> Of course , this is why pencils have erasers and operating systems have betas . Microsoft promises to make XP compatible with any device you can imagine by launch day . Then again , the brightest lights in Redmond could n't fix my problems over two days of lengthy conference calls . <P> I had a better time with Mac OS X. But that 's probably because I did n't have occasion to do any of the following : burn a CD , watch a DVD or use a service called AOL . ( When each will work with OS X : later this month , this summer and later this summer , respectively . ) My Mac headache  --  a doozy  --  came when I tried to set up a wireless Airport connection between my OS X machine and the other Macs I own , which run OS 9 . You guessed it : more conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating system is ready for prime time . My advice is to give even OS X a miss until a revamped version arrives later this year . Install it in the meantime , and you might face another tough choice : Advil or Tylenol ? <P> For more details , go to
