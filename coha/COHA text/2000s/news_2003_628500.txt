<p> GALVESTON - Big-time developers plan to launch massive residential and condominium projects at opposite ends of this resort island 's 32-mile beachfront , and other investors are gearing up to fill large gaps in the middle . <p> Opponents say some of the new development will illegally change traditional access to some beach stretches . But despite months of bitter protests , city officials seem poised to adopt the changes . <p> With the region 's population expected to grow by perhaps 2 million people in the next couple of decades , Galveston resort property will likely become even more desirable . More than ever , the island will continue to be what it traditionally has been dubbed : " Houston 's playground . " <p> What 's more , officials in this cash-strapped city are as eager to expand the property tax base and increase sales tax revenues as developers are to equip the playground . <p> Part of that play will occur on 1,100 acres near San Luis Pass at the island 's western tip . That 's where giant Centex Destination Properties plans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 125,000 each and about 900 townhome-style units pegged at $ 300,000 or more each , Centex regional development manager Ian Hause said recently . <p> " We 're excited about the Texas Gulf Coast in general , " said Hause . " It 's considered to be one of the last great opportunities in coastal development in the United States . " <p> While planned new development represents hundreds of millions of dollars in investment in the city , it is widespread enough that visitors likely wo n't sense profound change in the city in the short run . No one knows if the island eventually will see virtually wall-to-wall condominium and hotel beach development such as that in the Clearwater , Fla. , area and other Gulf Coast resorts . <p> Included in the Centex plans are a " beach club " near the Gulf of Mexico on the project 's south side and a deluxe marina for residents ' boats facing Galveston Bay on the property 's north side . <p> About 30 miles away , on the beach at the island 's far east end , Houston-based Falcon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase includes towers of 21 and 26 stories . The buildings , built to withstand hurricanes , will sit atop three stories of parking and share a lobby area with a view of beach , ocean and ships entering Galveston Bay . <p> Falcon Group expects to have no trouble selling about 275 custom-designed units for $ 200,000 to $ 1 million each . <p> Then Falcon Group plans to build two more towers . <p> The towers ' shadows eventually will fall across some of the 200 single-family homes that will constitute the first phase of nearby Beach Town , a 120-acre grid-style , open neighborhood finally cleared for construction after a decade of governmental and environmental hurdles . <p> Beach Town has 1,200 feet of beach frontage . It is modeled after Florida 's famed Seaside , a community centered around a commercial town square and designed to be reminiscent of know-your-neighbors , small-town America . <p> " The concept is ' old Galveston , ' " said Tofigh Shirazi , spokesman for Beach Town developer International United Investors Group of Houston . " I 'm hoping for ground-breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access plan expected to be presented to the Texas General Land Office by Galveston City Council this summer , all the developments will have to provide parking and pathways so the public can get to all parts of the island 's beaches . Critics say the plan establishes essentially private beaches because the public will have to walk too far with coolers and beach paraphernalia to make access reasonable . <p> Generally , the state , which regulates coastal development , requires public parking and access points at least every half mile along the beach . That means beachgoers should have to walk no more than about a quarter of a mile to get to any spot on the beach . <p> Of all planned Galveston developments , Centex 's is the most controversial because the city 's access plan is expected to prohibit vehicular traffic on most of about 3.5 miles of beach that fronts the firm 's tract . It 's the same beach stretch on which thousands have parked at water 's edge at least since the 1930s . <p> Indeed , until about 20 years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 miles of island beaches . But the city began cutting off traffic directly in front of beachfront subdivisions for safety reasons until only the last four miles or so east of San Luis Pass were completely open to vehicles . <p> Now , cars are expected to be barred from most of that stretch as the Centex development progresses . The cost and starting date of the project have not been determined , Hause said . <p> Fishermen and others have bitterly protested an access plan that provides for 650 parking spaces in off-beach lots in the Centex development and leaves open to vehicles only two-thirds of a mile along the Gulf west of the development . Another quarter of a mile on the Gulf east of the development would remain open to vehicles . <p> " If there were 100,000 people out there right now who said they wanted to keep San Luis Pass open , it would n't matter , " said Houstonian Tim Lopas , an avid fisherman and president of Texas Open Beaches Advocates . " The city 's broke , they are struggling to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and development is how they 're going to do it . " <p> The group wants to retain vehicular access to the westernmost four miles or so of the island . <p> With its plans for a marina , Centex threatens fishermen 's traditional bayside public access in the San Luis Pass area as well , Lopas maintained . He said hundreds of recent protest e-mails from citizens to regulators have gone unheeded . <p> Lopas ' group and others have threatened to file suit against the city and state , asking a judge or jury to enforce what the fishermen claim are established public beach easements for drivers as well as public rights under the Texas Open Beaches Act . <p> The act , adopted in 1959 , guarantees the public uninterrupted access along the state 's beaches . Galveston city officials admit that some high tides completely cover parts of the public beach , cutting off what is supposed to be continuous pedestrian access . The public beach is defined as the area of sand seaward of the natural vegetation line . <p> State and local officials are fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million for beach replenishment projects - some on Galveston Island - that would solve access problems at least temporarily . The Legislature put up $ 15 million for such projects during its last session . Residents in 17 west Galveston Island subdivisions already have put up matching funds in hopes of snagging some of that money for beach rebuilding projects . <p> Besides the Centex , Falcon Group and Beach Town projects , the city has received an application to build a new , 71-room hotel in the 8700 block of Seawall Boulevard and expects another for a condominium project nearby . In the last five years , a half-dozen economy hotels have been built on or close to the seawall . At least two other sizable subdivisions to be located not far from the west end of the city 's protective seawall are in the works . <p> City officials last week approved a preliminary plat for Beachside Village , a 150-home beachfront project on 50 acres just west of Eight Mile Road . Beachside Village will be similar in concept and design to Beach Town , said Stephen Schulz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reinhart . <p> One group is looking into building a golf course on the island 's west end . <p> Another group is trying to put together a tract to build a top-flight golf course and hotel resort near the Falcon Group and Beach Town sites . The latter area is one in which birdwatchers and environmental advocates have opposed resort development in favor of habitat preservation and pursuit of ecotourists ' dollars . <p> A new beachfront convention center is under construction at 57th and Seawall Boulevard . Houston businessman and Galveston native Tilman Fertitta is building the center , expected to open in mid-2004 . <p> He also plans to spend at least $ 7.5 million to build a Victorian-style hotel and an amusement park on the pier now occupied by the aged Flagship Hotel at 25th Street and Seawall Boulevard . <p> In addition , Fertitta is expected to enlarge the Hilton Hotel that is part of his San Luis Resort complex and to acquire the property from 33rd to 35th streets on the seawall now occupied by the rundown Seahorse Inn . <p> Timetables for most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since 1991 , 1,047 new single-family homes have been built on Galveston Island , bringing the total to 17,003 , according to Galveston Central Appraisal District records . Total valuation of the homes has jumped from about $ 944 million to nearly $ 1.6 billion . The city 's population is 57,247 , according to census figures . <p> The appraisal numbers include valuations for Jamaica Beach , a city , and Pirates ' Beach , a municipal utility district , both on the island . <p> So far , city officials say , there 's no end in sight for the island 's building boom . <p> " We are just issuing permits right and left for renovations , remodels and new construction , " Galveston Planning Director Wendy O'Donohoe said in April . " We issue about 500 permits a month . " <p> <p> PROPOSED CHANGES <p> Planned development on parts of Galveston 's beachfront would change traditional access to some beach stretches .
