ONE <br> Heart , give voice to sing <br> Of life on dragonwings ! <br> <br> Fort Weyr , AL 507.11.17 , Second Interval <br> " ... and you would n't believe how many holders they 've saved over the last ten Turns , " Benden Weyrleader M'tal said , continuing to press his case for the watch- whers . <br> The three remaining Weyrleaders had adjourned to Fort Weyr 's Council Room to await the Hatching and confer . <br> C'rion of Ista Weyr snorted and shook his head . " I 'm sorry , M'tal , but the time 's all wrong , " he said . " Threads will be falling all too soon and here you are with this radical notion of training dragons and watch- whers to ? y Threads together at night . " <br> M'tal took a slow , calming breath to sti ? e the hot retort he wanted to make . He looked expectantly to K'lior . <br> The youngest Weyrleader of Pern shifted uneasily under the gray- haired man 's gaze . Well aware that M'tal had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it hard to refute such a length of experience . Of course , C'rion was even older still and had made his feelings well- known . <br> " Look , " M'tal began again , his hands outstretched in a placating gesture , " just think  --  " <br> He broke off as his ears detected the unmistakable hum of dragons at Hatching . He smiled and gestured at K'lior . " Weyrleader ? " <br> K'lior was already on his feet and heading for the doorway that led to the Hatching Grounds . <br> Kindan and Kentai , Fort Weyr 's harper , were waiting on the stairs to the viewing stands in the Hatching Grounds , ready to escort the more feeble or overly- excited holders up to a good perch . Kindan nodded to M'tal as the Weyrleader passed by , still engrossed in fer &shy; vent conversation with the Istan and Fort Weyrleaders . <br> " I see D'gan has departed , " Kentai murmured to Kindan as the Weyrleaders climbed out of earshot . <br> Kindan shrugged . He knew that M'tal had not been counting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the looks he 'd seen on C'rion 's and K'lior 's faces  --  neither looked very thrilled with what M'tal was saying to them . Kindan , who was familiar with M'tal 's plan , shook his head . Could n't the other Weyrleaders see that watch- whers , with their night- seeing eyes , were supposed to ? y the night Threadfalls ? <br> " Lord Itaral , Lady Nelyssa , " Kentai called as he spotted the Lord and Lady Holders of Ruatha Hold . He smiled as he spotted the third person in their party . " I see that you 've convinced Lady Ilyssa to join you this time . " He nodded to their young daughter and raised an elbow invitingly . " May I escort you to your seats ? " <br> Ilyssa blushed , but , overcoming her embarrassed smile , curt &shy; sied most elegantly and took his arm . <br> " This is Kindan , " Kentai said with a nod toward the other harper . " He 's come with Lord M'tal from Benden Weyr . " <br> Lady Nelyssa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Are n't you the one  --  " She caught herself and rapidly switched her comment . "  --  I mean , are n't you the young man who gave up his watch- wher to Nuella , the WherMaster ? " <br> " Among other things , I am known for that , " Kindan agreed , in &shy; clining his head politely and giving her a slight smile . He knew what she 'd started to say , and wondered if he would ever live down the stigma of the ? re in the Harper Hall 's Archive rooms . He had n't been solely responsible , after all , and he 'd fought the hard &shy; est to put the blaze out , preserving countless other Records . . . <br> " Kindan ! " <br> Before he could even react to the sound of his name , the speaker pummeled into him , clutching him tightly about the waist and trying her best to squeeze the breath out of him . Brilliant sea- blue eyes looked out from behind a lock of rebellious honey- blond hair as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well- dressed Lord Holder behind her , " You did n't tell me he 'd be here ! " <br> Bemin of Fort Hold smiled indulgently at his daughter . " There are such things as surprises , Fiona , " he said with a wink . <br> " Oh , Kindan , it 's so good to see you ! " Fiona exclaimed , burying her face once more in Kindan 's chest . <br> " It 's good to see you , too , " Kindan replied . He held out a hand to Fort Hold 's Lord Holder . The older man , face lined with age and sad memories , took it in his own and gripped it tightly . <br> " Good to see you again , lad , " Bemin said . He looked up the stairs . " I think we 'd better get up there or the dragons will all have hatched . " <br> Fiona turned toward the steps , ? rmly locking her arms around Kindan 's elbow . " Harper Kindan , " she said , sounding every inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the honor of escorting me ? " <br> " It would be my pleasure , Lady Fiona , " Kindan replied with equal aplomb . A bronze ? re- lizard darted down from the heights , alighted for a moment on Kindan 's shoulder , chirped happily to him , then rose again in the air . <br> Lord Bemin chuckled . " I see that Valla followed you . " <br> " I ca n't keep him away from a Hatching , " Kindan confessed . He craned his neck up and scanned the swarm of ? re- lizards over &shy; head . " Where are Jokester and Fire ? " <br> " We left them behind , " Bemin said . " I doubt either of them is as well- trained as yours . " <br> " Well , they 've barely two Turns out of the shell , " Kindan allowed . " Give them time . " <br> " Like all youngsters , they are impetuous and brash , " Bemin agreed with a twinkle in his eyes . " Why , you would not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Fiona protested , a warm blush highlighting her freckles . Bemin laughed . <br> " Chasing tunnel snakes again ? " Kindan asked her in a voice pitched for her ears alone . <br> He was not successful , as Bemin snorted , saying , " I can not teach her any decorum at all ! " He continued , " She was hours in the bath and I 'm sure there 's still dirt on her . " <br> Kindan felt Fiona grab him tighter and heard her groan , but when he glanced down he saw the smile in her eyes . <br> " He 's sounding much happier , " he said quietly . <br> " He deserves it , " Fiona replied . <br> Kindan nodded in agreement . Lord Holder Bemin had kept his Hold together twelve Turns before when the Plague had struck and killed nearly one in four of his Holders , including his wife and all his children , save for the youngest , Fiona . <br> Kindan , sent from the Harper Hall to Fort Hold in disgrace after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kilti , to do everything pos &shy; sible for the sick and dying . In the end , Kilti had succumbed to the Plague himself , leaving Kindan , at fourteen , in charge . <br> Fiona cocked her head at a change in the sound and then leapt up the steps , dragging Kindan along . " Come on , they 're hatching ! " <br> Indeed they were . Kindan , Fiona , and Bemin found seats saved for them next to Lord Itaral and his family . <br> " Just some greens , " Ilyssa assured Fiona as she patted the empty seat she 'd saved for her friend . Fiona relinquished her grip on Kindan with an apologetic look and happily took her place be &shy; side Ilyssa . The two leaned toward each other and began to speak in low voices . <br> The hot sands rapidly ? lled with white- robed candidates , ? own in by Fort Weyr 's bronze dragons . The rest of Fort 's dragons , perched high above , hummed in welcome , the sound growing louder as the eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hush as the ? rst egg cracked open . A brown dragonet ? opped out , awkward and creeling . A group of candidates darted anxiously around it  --  some moving toward it , some away . And then  --  one candidate reached out to the baby dragon and Impressed . The dragons hummed approvingly . <br> Another dragonet burst forth from its egg , and another , and another . From the stands , it seemed as though of tide of white- robed candidates ? owed and ebbed around the blue , green , brown , and bronze dragonets until , ? nally , one white- robed ? gure stood pro &shy; tectively beside each dragonet as the miracle of Impression was repeated . <br> " Look there ! " Fiona called , pointing toward one of the larger eggs . " Is that a queen ? " <br> " It could be , " Kindan said . A great rent appeared in the shell , followed moments later by a golden head . " It is ! " <br> The little queen made quick work of extricating herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Freed at last , the little gold queen walked around , looking from one candidate to another . <br> " What would happen if there was n't a suitable candidate ? " Fiona muttered to Kindan , who shrugged in response . The girls were trying ; one bold girl just barely dodged the dragonet 's awkward movements , pulled aside at the last moment by a shorter , younger , dark- haired girl . <br> Kentai had overheard the exchange . " There are Records , " he said , looking uncomfortable . <br> " Well , she 's coming this way , " Ilyssa noted with excitement . <br> " We 're near the exit to the Bowl , " Kentai remarked . " Maybe she 's looking for someone out there . " <br> She was n't . Still ignoring the girls clustered around her , even the bold dark- haired one that Fiona would have thought she 'd like , the dragonet lurched over to the visitor stands . She looked up into the stands and creeled desperately . Kindan and Bemin exchanged alarmed looks as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew wide with shock and she glanced worriedly at Lord Bemin . Bemin seemed to wilt in despair  --  Fiona was his last surviving child  --  but he recovered and nodded weakly . <br> " What 's her name ? " he asked his daughter , gesturing to the gold below and forcing his lips into a smile . <br> The dragonet creeled again piteously and Fiona turned back to her , her face glowing in pure joy as she declared , " She says her name is Talenth ! " <br> Kindan picked out K'lior and Cisca climbing down the stairs toward them . It was obvious from the look on her face that Cisca had taken in the full import of the event . She would handle things from here . Kindan , who , after all , was beholden to Benden not Fort Weyr , turned away for a last look at the now empty Hatching Grounds . <br> For a moment , a very brief moment , before the egg had proved to be a gold , Kindan had imagined what might have happened if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? re-lizard , Valla , swooped down from his perch above , pleased with himself for locating Kindan and thrilled to have seen the Hatching . <br> Kindan shook himself from his reverie . He had been a miner , had bonded with a watch- wher , the dragons ' kin , and now he was a harper who had Impressed a ? re- lizard . The Red Star was approaching , bringing the deadly Threads , and everything would change when the dragons began the ? fty- Turn battle to save Pern from extinction . Vaguely Kindan wondered if he would live to see the end of the Pass and the return of the less trying times he had been born into . <br> The beating of a drum , the call to dinner , and a personal plea from Kentai for help in entertaining the revelers spurred Kindan up and out of the Hatching Grounds . At the entrance , he turned back once more , unable to contain his longing . <br> Kindan could n't remember who waved him toward the sleeping quarters or quite how he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebration at which he had sung much , danced much , and drank much  --  far more than his usual . He had no idea why he 'd drunk so much , nor why he 'd worked so hard that evening . . . until he woke in the middle of the night in a cold sweat . <br> The Weyr was silent , but the silence seemed more oppressive than comforting . The sound of his labored breathing came harshly to his ears and he sat up in his cot , glancing around nervously to check if his nightmare had disturbed anyone else to whom he 'd have to make a quick apology . <br> He heard no one . <br> In the distance a dragonet creeled uneasily . Then silence . <br> Kindan sighed and swung his legs over the side of the cot . <br> It was n't as if he was the only one who had nightmares of the Plague , but he had n't had many in the past several Turns , so he was surprised that he 'd had one now . Something about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sang so hard and drank so much to keep away the pain . Not that it had worked , obviously . <br> The Plague that had swept across Pern and then  --  just as quickly  --  disappeared , had struck when he had only fourteen Turns , leaving him solely in charge of Fort Hold 's sick when the aged healer had himself succumbed to the disease . So many had died . <br> So many , including Koriana , Lord Bemin 's daughter and Fiona 's older sister . <br> " Koriana , " Kindan whispered . The sound of her name brought both joy and pain , like a rose : pretty smell , prickly thorns . He shook his head . " I 'm sorry . " <br> I tried , he thought . But he wondered , as he always wondered : Did I try hard enough ? <br> <br> Resolutely , Kindan lay back in the cot and closed his eyes . Presently , his breathing eased and he relaxed , but he did not sleep . And in that space between sleeping and waking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> <br> Talenth 's creel woke Fiona instantly . <br> What is it ? she asked , jumping out of her bed and rushing to the young queen 's lair . <br> He hurts , Talenth whimpered . Fiona knelt and pulled the young queen 's head into her lap . <br> I 'm sorry , she thought to her dragon , gently caressing the leathery hide . <br> He hurts and you feel it , Talenth said . How is it that you feel it ? <br> <br> Fiona furrowed her brow in surprise . At ? rst she thought that Talenth was referring to her father , but then she forced herself to be honest . She had wheedled and whined her very best to con &shy; vince her father to bring her to this Hatching , all because she knew that Kindan would be here . <br> I do n't know , she confessed . I just do . I 'm sorry that it hurts you , too . <br> Can you help him ? <br> Fiona bent to cradle Talenth 's head with her whole body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep inside her , Fiona knew that was a lie . As she considered it , she heard a noise  --  a dragon going between . <br> <br> We 've been here long enough , let 's go , the rider thought to the dragon under her . <br> As you wish , the dragon responded . With a great heave of its hind legs , the dragon leapt into the air and went between . <br> Continues ...
