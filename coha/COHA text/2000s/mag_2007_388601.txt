Headnote The legendary comedian 's son , on giving his dad the lift of his life . // I SEE HIM IN THE CORNER OF MY eye , head back , eyes closed , mouth hanging open . When he starts snoring , I move in . " Okay , that 's it , " I say . turning off the TV . " Time for bed . " " What ? Huh ? No , no . I 'm line . I 'm up ! " His eyes are wide with protest . " Look at the time , " I say , gesturing to the clock . " Look at yourself ! " " I 'm not tired ! " he insists . His heels are dug in . " If I go to bed , I wo n't he able to sleep . " I sigh , and give in . " Three more dozes , " I say . " On the third , you go to bed . Okay ? " " Okay . " " Okay , Dad . " + + @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us are ever truly prepared to face . Inevitably , it happens after one parent passes away . You can only hope you 're smack dab in your 50s , your own kids off to college , your career winding down , your pockets full of life experience to help keep things in perspective . But I was 33 when my mother died . My father was 79 . My life was just beginning . My career was picking up speed . I was barely 2 years into my marriage , and my baby boy was n't even 2 months old . What did I know about being there for my dad , a man who 'd never-and I 'm not kidding here-been alone a night in his life ? He 'd gone from sharing a room with his three brothers , to the army , to his first marriage , to living with a friend , to his second marriage , with my mother . Their 44 years together fused them . When she left us , he was set adrift . On the way back to Manhattan after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What the hell are you doing ? " my father barked . " We do n't take tunnels ! " The driver stammered . At this time of day , it was the quickest way , he explained . " That does n't matter , " my dad roared . " We never take tunnels ! We ca n't ! " I took his hand . " Dad , that was Mom who did n't like tunnels . " He 'd been her shield against those dark , closed spaces , and he was n't putting down his guard yet . A few nights later , my father was giving my son a bedtime bottle . I sat watching . His cellphone rang for what must have been the hundredth time that day , but he switched it off without looking , then glanced up at me . " No one knew her like we did , " ho said . " No one understands what we 're going through but us . " At that moment , I realized I was now my father 's keeper . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been for my son . As it turns out , the parenting lessons I learned in the months following his birth applied equally well to my dad . For example ... * Put yourself second . I 'd just lost my mother , the woman who raised me , nurtured me , protected me . It was a huge blow , and I felt like I needed my father more than ever . But where was he ? Lost , grieving , struggling to make it through each day . I quickly realized that he could n't help me through this , and it was n't fair for me to expect him to . I still had a family , a life , a future . All my father had was me-I was my parents ' only child . He was helpless . You do n't weigh opportunities like this . You rise to meet them . * Let him crawl before he runs . Sure , you keep the big picture in mind . But when my son 's diaper is loaded , I ca n't he worrying about where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forget about where my father was going to live out the remainder of his life , so I could talk him through one more long night . * Learn his language . Just as I learned which sounds soothed and delighted my son , I figured out how to calm my lather when his fears boiled over . He did n't want to hear any new-age psychobabble , like " find your inner peace . " The man fought in World War II . Once , I asked him , " Did you think about what it would take to rebuild postwar Europe ? " " Hell , no , " he replied . " You thought about how you were going to stay warm that night , how you were going to get from one hedgerow to another without . some German sniper takingyou out . You did n't worry about tomorrow . " In the months after my mom passed , I sat with him a lot , going over the timelineof events : from the day the oncologist told her " Your scan came back , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing . " What am I going to do ? " my father would ask , sad , anxious , sometimes angry . All I could say was , " One hedgerow to the next , Dad . " * Keep him regular . Every baby is different , and so is every 79-year-old widower . In both cases , however , when you find something that makes them happy , you stick with it . My dad liked going to the same restaurant , so I took him every night . Nothing fancy , just a hole in the wall , one of the few in New York where he would n't be recognized . He also liked old war flicks , so I scoured Froogle and Amazon for all the black-and-white DVDs I could find . I could probably act out every scene in Run Silent , Run Deep . * Set up play dates . Right after my mother died , MIV dad would just show up at my house . There would be a knock at the door , and that was it . He was staying-usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mind . But soon my baby was on a rigid schedule , and my father 's comings and goings easily disrupted him . " Dad , you ca n't just drop by , " I told him . " We have to make concrete plans . Or , at the very least , you have to call first . " That was tough , but for the best . People need structure , especially those just coming into the world and those who 've just had their worlds destroyed . Routine creates stability and security . It gives people something to depend on each day , and something to look forward to when they go to bed at night . I knew my actions would carry more weight than my words , so I made sure to put my son to bed at the same time every night , whether Dad showed up on time to say goodnight to him or not . When he complained , I 'd look at the clock and say , " You should 've called . " * Have a sitter on speed dial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wile hired a nanny . It was my job to cover my dad . My three half-siblings were great . They made sure he never ate alone . Friends were tougher . My dad did n't want to spend time with couples , especially those he 'd only known with my mom . But he had a few friends he could go to the racetrack with . I also began begging Dad to return to work . I 'd always been jealous of my father 's passionate devotion to his career . My mother called it his mistress . I called it his favorite son . Of all the emotional barriers I 'd overcome to help my dad , embracing my childhood archrival was the toughest . But it worked . Dad started writing again . He also began working with his old team from The Producers . Slowly , the passion returned . Now I see it in his eyes . +++ I 'M NOT SURE THAT MY FATHER WILL EVER truly recover from my mom 's death . As he said in The Twelve Chairs , " Hope for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's waking up every morning , going to work , seeing his friends . These are all victories . Watching him with my son reminds me of something else I learned : Know when to let go . There 's a limit to my power over my son . I can love , protect , teach , and guide him , hut in the end , who he becomes will he up to genetics , or God , or whatever it is that makes us who we are . The one thing I ca n't give him is that special light that shines within my father . Dad has taken the hardest blow , and he 's refusing to crumple up and die . He 's still the man I looked up Io when I was growing up . He 's still my hero . And he 's snoring again . I turn off the television . " Okay , that 's it . " " Fine , fine , I 'm going , just let me get another glass of water . " Dad says . He stands up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not even ... " " Dad ... " " Fine , " he huffs . He starts for the stairs , then turns . " I love you , son . He 's been saying that a lot lately . " I know , Dad . I love you , too . Now go to bed .

Sidebar The 5 stages of an aging father " It 's difficult for men to accept that they 're getting older , because they do n't undergo dramatic changes , like menopause , that force them to face it , " says gerontologist David Haber , Ph.D. , of Ball State University .

Now he rolls into work after 9 a.m . No worries-he 's accepted that younger , more eager people will be collecting the promotions now .

IN HIS 60s ... He puts himself in danger . " Even after a man accepts that he ca n't physically do the things he used to , he 'll still try , " says Joseph Ilardo , Ph.D. , coauthor of Are Your Parents Driving You Crazy ? . " He wants to feel as if the world has n't beaten him . " Blame your paranoia : " Dad , you 're scaring me on that ladder . Can I help ? " His mind closes .

You have three choices : Steer clear of hot-button issues , agree to disagree , or , perhaps best , call him on it in a lighthearted way-it 's a great way to start a conversation , says Ilardo .
