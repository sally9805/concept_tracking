Prologue I brought to life , Dani thought . The vision . The smell of blood turned her stomach , the thick , acrid smoke burned her eyes , and what had been for so long a wispy , dreamlike memory was now jarring , throat-clogging reality . For just an instant she was paralyzed . It was all coming true . Despite everything she had done , everything she had tried to do , despite all the warnings , once again it was all- " Dani ? " Hollis appeared at her side , seemingly out of the smoke , gun drawn , blue eyes sharp even squinted against the stench . " Where is it ? " " I-I ca n't . I mean , I do n't think I can- " " Dani , you 're all we 've got . You 're all they 've got . Do you understand that ? " Reaching desperately for strength she was n't at all sure she had , Dani said , " If somebody had just listened to me when it mattered- " " Stop looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all that counts . Which way , Dani ? " Impossible as it was , Dani had to force herself to concentrate on the stench of blood she knew neither of the others could smell . A blood trail that was all they had to guide them . She nearly gagged , then pointed . " That way.Toward the back . But . . . " " But what ? " " Down . Lower . There 's a basement level . " Stairs . She remembered stairs . Going down them . Down into hell . " It is n't on the blueprints . " " I know . " " Bad place to get trapped in a burning building , " Hollis noted . " The roof could fall in on us . Easily . " Bishop appeared out of the smoke as suddenly as Hollis had , weapon in hand , his face stone , eyes haunted . " We have to hurry . " " Yeah , " Hollis replied , " we get that . Burning building . Maniacal killer . Good seriously outnumbered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were flippant , but her gaze on his face was anything but , intent and measuring . " You forgot potential victim in maniacal killer 's hands , " her boss said , not even trying to match her tone . " Never . Dani , did you see the basement , or are you feeling it ? " " Stairs . I saw them . " The weight on her shoulders felt like the world , so maybe that was what was pressing her down . Or . . . " And what I feel now ... He 's lower . He 's underneath us . " " Then we look for stairs . " Dani coughed . She was trying to think , trying to remember . But dreams recalled were such dim , insubstantial things , even vision dreams sometimes , and there was no way for her to be sure she was remembering clearly . She was overwhelmingly conscious of precious time passing and looked at her wrist , at the bulky digital watch that told her it was 2:47 p.m. on Tuesday , October 28 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wearing one now ? And why a watch that looked so . . . alien on her thin wrist ? " Dani ? " She shook off the momentary confusion . " The stairs . Not where you 'd expect them to be , " she managed finally , coughing again . " They 're in a closet or something like that . A small office . Room . Not a hallway . Hallways- " A flash of endless , featureless hallways , brightly lit . . . " What ? " The image in her mind vanished as quickly as it had come , and Dani dismissed it as unimportant because an absolute certainty had replaced it . " Shit . The basement is divided . By a solid wall . Two big rooms . And accessed from this main level by two different stairways , one at each side of the building , in the back . " " What kind of crazy-ass design is that ? " Hollis demanded . " If we get out of this alive , you can ask the architect . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head was beginning to hurt . Badly . Hallways . No , not hallways , two separate spaces , distinct sides . . . She had never before pushed herself for so long without a break , especially with this level of intensity . It was Bishop who said , " You do n't know which side they 're in . " " No . I 'm sorry . " She felt as if she 'd been apologizing to this man since she met him . Hell , she had been . Hollis was scowling . To Bishop , she said , " Great . That 's just great . You 're psychically blind , the storm has all my senses scrambled , and we 're in a huge burning building without a freakin ' map . " " Which is why Dani is here . " Those pale sentry eyes were fixed on her face . Dani felt wholly inadequate . " I-I don't- All I know is that he 's down there somewhere . " " And Miranda ? " The name caused her a queer little shock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dizzy sense of something out of place , out of sync somehow . But she had an answer for him . Of sorts . " She isn't-dead . Yet . She 's bait , you know that . She was always bait , to lure you . " " And you , " Bishop said . Dani did n't want to think about that . Could n't , for some reason she was unable to explain , think about that . " We have to go , now . He wo n't wait , not this time . " And he 's not the only one . The conversation had taken only brief minutes , but even so the smoke was thicker , the crackling roar of the fire louder , and the heat growing ever more intense . Bitterly , Hollis said , " We 're on his timetable , just like before , like always , carried along without the chance to stop and think . " Bishop turned and started toward the rear of the building and the south corner . " I 'll go down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dani wondered if instinct was guiding him as well , but all she said , to Hollis , was , " He would n't take the chance if he had it , would he ? To stop and think , I mean . " " If it meant a minute lost in getting to Miranda ? No way in hell . That alone would be enough , but on top of that he blames himself for this mess . " " He could n't have known- " " Yes . He could have . Maybe he even did . That 's why he believes it 's his fault . Come on , let 's go . " Dani followed but had to ask , " Do you believe it 's his fault ? " Hollis paused for only an instant , looking back over her shoulder , and there was something hard and bright in her eyes . " Yes . I do . He played God one time too many . And we 're paying the price for his arrogance . " Again , Dani followed the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they reached the rear half of the building , the smoke was n't nearly as thick . They very quickly discovered , in the back of what might once have been a small office , a door that opened smoothly and silently to reveal a stairwell . The stairwell was already lighted . " Bingo , " Hollis breathed . A part of Dani wanted to suggest that they wait , at least long enough for Bishop to check out the other side of the building , but every instinct as well as the waves of heat at her back told her there simply was n't time to wait . Hollis shifted her weapon to a steady two-handed grip and sent Dani a quick look . " Ready ? " Dani did n't spare the energy to wonder how anyone on earth could ever be ready for this . Instead , she concentrated on the only weapon she had , the one inside her aching head , and nodded . Hollis had only taken one step when a thunderous crash sounded behind them and a new wave of almost intolerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The roof was falling in.
