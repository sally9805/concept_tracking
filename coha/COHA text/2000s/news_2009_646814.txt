The current financial crisis is all-inclusive ; our path to prosperity or even simple financial stability seemingly obliterated . <p> With every furlough , layoff or stock market drop , Americans of all ages and backgrounds are seeing their incomes dwindle , bills pile up and financial options disappear . <p> The number who are suffering has increased by 3 million the past year , according to a recent Gallup-Healthways survey . Some 37% of us said we were worried about money last week . Last year , 3.2 million consumers contacted the National Foundation for Credit Counseling , up from 2.2 million in 2007 and 1.4 million in 2006 . <p> " What 's happening to families is a perfect storm , " says Bob Manning , a finance professor at Rochester Institute of Technology . <p> The personal stories illustrate how unemployment , health problems , shrinking retirement savings , unaffordable mortgages and other financial stressors lead to unprecedented challenges , worry and consequences . Recent history has shown periods when one area of concern consumed a family  --  a lost job for six weeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people once could piece together solutions to recover financially or prevent outright financial ruin , fewer options exist today . <p> " Some people will never get out of debt , " Manning says . <p> Whether you 're in a financial crisis depends on your debt problem , says Steve Bucci , president of the Money Management International Financial Education Foundation , a non-profit organization . If you are less than 90 days late on a credit card bill , that 's not a crisis . But if you are 90 days late on your mortgage , that 's an earthquake , and if you are one month late on your car loan you might lose the car , Bucci says . <p> " For many , it 's not one particular event , as much as it is life events starting to pile up , " says Gerri Detweiler , co-author of Reduce Debt , Reduce Stress . " And it 's compounded by the economy and the lack of credit options that are available . " <p> Retirement on the line <p> The elderly have been harder hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older jumped 150% from 1991 through 2007 , according to a study released last year by AARP . Although they have been known as the most frugal savers , today , many of them are deep in debt and without a safety net . <p> Howard Zynkian , 89 , filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy more than a year ago to help him save his home . Unlike Chapter 7 bankruptcy , which allows people to have most unsecured debts discharged , Chapter 13 sets up a plan for the filer to repay most debts over several years . <p> But Zynkian , who lives in El Cajon , Calif. , refinanced his home five years ago and did n't understand that he was getting into a risky , alternative mortgage . After his monthly mortgage payment had jumped from $1,500 to $2,700 , he was facing foreclosure . <p> The retired dentist had used up all of his retirement savings to pay his rising mortgage bills . He cares for his daughter , who has severe back problems , and together they receive about $2,900 a month in Social Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to get a loan modification from his lender . Now he will pay $1,269 a month on a 3% loan rate . After five years it will go up to 4% and then six years later , it will move to 5% for the rest of the term . <p> " I can just barely manage it , " he says . <p> Zynkian 's story is an example of how critical events are coming together for people in every life stage , from the youngest to the oldest , says Melissa Jacoby , a law professor at the University of North Carolina . <p> " And we used to assume that the elderly had already built wealth in their homes , and that was part of their retirement plan , " she says . <p> Even those who are still working often have less money available to contribute to their retirement plans . Those who are retired and kept most of their 401(k) plans or IRAs invested in stocks have in many cases watched the funds lose half their values . <p> " The rules seem to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bucci says . <p> For example , retirement savings are being used now for paying bills . The golden rule for retirement planning and funds : People still need to continue to save for the long term , and their 401(k) will be a fundamental part of their retirement , says Brent Neiser , director of Strategic Programs and Alliances for the National Endowment for Financial Education . And when stocks and other investments go down , one could consider them a blue-light special and buy more . <p> But those close to retirement should keep adding to savings , try to work longer and claim Social Security later , so that the monthly check is larger . <p> Especially if your retirement savings can provide only temporary financial help , you should n't rely on it now . <p> What to do before layoffs <p> Few life changes affect finances as much as a lost job . <p> Last year , Amy and Mike Dew , from Sanford , N.C. , both were laid off from jobs . It took Mike about nine months to find a new job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just started working again this month . <p> They are earning much less . <p> " We literally went from almost a $100,000 salary to probably $50,000 for the two of us , " Amy says . <p> Recently the Dews , who have two teenage daughters , filed for bankruptcy . They gave up one car and their home . <p> Last month , the national jobless rate was 8.1% , the highest in more than 25 years . <p> If you expect to lose your job or have your salary slashed , get prepared . Try now to implement a very bare-bones budget and prioritize expenses . " It gives you a better sense of what you can and can not handle if you lose your job , " Detweiler says . <p> If you are without a job , consider making only minimum payments , using a line of credit as long as it 's available , and keeping your money in a safe place , such as an FDIC-insured bank account . " You need to save your cash because when your cash is gone you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills can be a problem <p> Health problems and taking care of family members add up to a double whammy of costs : financial and emotional . <p> Ardella Mitchell , 44 , who is raising her 16-year-old son and two grandchildren , has lupus and fibromyalgia . " I get sick a lot , and I 'll always have it . " <p> Mitchell , who lives in Cleveland , works as a nursing assistant and schedules her hours based on how well she feels . She recently filed for bankruptcy because her husband is unemployed . <p> " I had a lot of medical bills that I could n't pay because I do n't have insurance , " she says . <p> Health problems often trigger bankruptcy filing , Jacoby says . And even people with health insurance sometimes become overwhelmed with medical debt . <p> When families are hit by a combination of serious illness and debt , they should quickly seek help from a credit counselor and a bankruptcy lawyer . <p> If you do n't have health insurance , negotiate the best cost for treatment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment dates on bills not covered . <p> Trying to keep your home <p> The biggest debt for most of us  --  our mortgages  --  has been at the center of the economic collapse . <p> Sandra Barker and her husband chased the American dream from South Florida to Houston in 2005 hoping for better career options . Sandra is an executive search consultant , and her husband worked in sales . <p> But their jobs did n't pan out as they thought , and they returned to Florida about eight months later . <p> " When we came back , it was really painful because the ( housing ) prices were at their peak , " she says . <p> They bought a home with a hefty mortgage . Last December , they filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy because her husband had lost his job and was in an accident . Debts were mounting , but they wanted to keep their home . <p> Home foreclosures are still rising in many markets , and that is causing prices to continue to fall . At least in some cities , home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options to help homeowners reduce their mortgages . <p> The House has approved a plan to give debt-strapped homeowners a chance to lower mortgage payments via bankruptcy courts . And the Senate is considering loan modification legislation . <p> For most families , the traditional wisdom is to always pay for your mortgage when debt mounts , Jacoby says . <p> " When people have so many competing bills to pay , it is difficult to decide what to do , " she says . " But if you want to keep your home you 're going to have to pay for your mortgage , even if you file for bankruptcy . " <p> Credit counseling can help <p> Oscar Garcia , 57 , filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy two years ago to cope with rising credit card debt . He kept up with his mortgage payments and wanted to keep his home . <p> But then last year , his job in New Jersey was eliminated , and the company closed . His wife was diagnosed with breast cancer and had surgery followed by chemotherapy . <p> He does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved too costly . He is up to date with his mortgage but is worried that if he does n't get a job he 'll lose the home . <p> " He is a typical immigrant story who came here and picked himself up , doing well , raising a family , " says his bankruptcy lawyer , Mark Goldman . " But now 20 years later he loses his job , and he wo n't be able to retire . " <p> Home equity loans and credit cards ca n't cover for debt anymore . <p> " Many of the safety nets are drying up , " Jacoby says . " So we see people engaging in more informal borrowing from friends and family , who are also in difficult financial trouble . " <p> When the typical solutions disappear and problems mushroom , many people panic . Some respond by ignoring their plight as long as they can , while others make sudden choices without seeking the advice of experts . <p> Several initiatives are being launched by the government , organizations and the private sector to help financially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding out if you qualify is challenging , Neiser says . And that is where a non-profit credit-counseling organization , which is not selling anything , can help . <p> " Finances are so personal that we 're almost suggesting that people hold up a mirror to look at themselves and their money and what 's going on there , " Neiser says . " But then they should look outside of themselves to find out what are some of the smart things they should be doing as they move forward .
