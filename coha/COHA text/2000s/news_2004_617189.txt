<p> He 's had 12 months to assemble his team and develop a winning strategy , and now it 's game time for Gov . Sonny Perdue . <p> He 's no longer confounded by the recession-scarred budget he inherited . Perdue spent 103 hours in the past year immersed in the budget and became comfortable enough to change the whole culture of how it 's developed . <p> Government is no longer rife with Democrat appointees whose loyalties are suspect . He 's replaced most of the major department heads and shuffled his administration . <p> And he 's had plenty of on-the-job training . He waded into Atlanta 's sewer crisis , lobbied Washington to bring the G-8 summit to Georgia and went to four countries recruiting new business . <p> Georgia 's first Republican governor since Reconstruction enjoyed a year 's grace period in many people 's minds . After all , he was taking over an entrenched , 130-year-old Democratic bureaucracy . He was dogged by a campaign promise to allow a popular vote on the state flag and bedeviled by a budget crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of growing pains the first year . We all did , " said state Rep. Mack Crawford ( R-Zebulon ) . " The test will be this session . " <p> Perdue acknowledges that he got off to a " rocky " start . And he says he realizes some think he was naive , if not bumbling . <p> " I think I probably misunderstood the lingering partisan rancor , " Perdue , a Democratic leader in the state Senate before he switched parties in 1998 , said in a recent interview . " I thought that I was reaching out as much as I possibly could . I think in hindsight I could have done more and done better . " <p> The glow of Perdue 's historic inauguration was quickly shattered in his first week in office . He caused a storm with his call for property , alcohol and tobacco tax increases to balance the budget . <p> Republican legislators , who had longed for years to have their man in the top job , were stunned and chagrined that the first modern GOP governor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulted  --  or at least warned . <p> Perdue soon backed away from the property tax and quit pushing the alcohol tax . He squeaked a modest tobacco increase through the Legislature last year , but little else . <p> His second legislative session starts Monday , and all sides will be watching to see if he can better navigate a General Assembly divided between Democratic House and Republican Senate . <p> " This will be the session in which he 'll be judged on his own , " said state Sen. George Hooks ( D-Americus ) , a 23-year legislative veteran . " It 's now completely and totally his show . " <p> The stakes are high for Perdue . For one thing , he 's what political scientist Larry Sabato calls " a history-maker . " <p> " History-makers frequently have extra pressures placed upon them , such as high expectations for their term of office , " said Sabato , director of the University of Virginia 's Center for Politics . <p> In addition , this is an election year for all 236 legislators . <p> Control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Perdue 's performance could be key to helping the GOP to win control of the House  --  and thereby complete their takeover of state government . <p> Likewise , a bad session for him could be fodder for Democrats who want to keep or widen their margins in the House and reclaim the Senate , isolating Perdue . <p> Promoting his agenda <p> To date , Perdue has given piecemeal glimpses of his 2004 legislative agenda and has already gone out in the state pushing it  --  something critics say he did n't do last year . <p> The governor says his priorities will be the broad categories of kids , jobs and getting government to live within its means , along with some specific proposals likely to spark debate . <p> The Georgia Association of Educators is lining up with the Anti-Defamation League , People for the American Way and other groups to fight Perdue 's plan for a constitutional amendment that would allow faith-based organizations to provide government-funded social services . <p> GAE views the amendment as a back-door move to introduce private school vouchers , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he 's not always going to be governor , " said Jocelyn Whitfield , GAE director of government relations . " We do n't want to set up a system that would potentially harm public schools . " <p> Perdue also wants lawmakers to reconsider the always partisan topic of legislative redistricting , the once-a-decade redrawing of political boundaries to reflect changes in the state 's population . <p> House Speaker Terry Coleman ( D-Eastman ) , who plays a paramount role in deciding what the House considers , may be a roadblock for Perdue on that issue . He said in a recent interview that he considers the case closed on redistricting . " We 've been to court , and courts have generally ruled in the state 's favor , " he said . <p> Modest proposals <p> The Democratic leadership in the House is promising to come with its own agenda , part of which will hit on topics Perdue is promising to bring up , including limiting jury awards . <p> Perdue 's agenda is modest compared to those of his predecessors , Democrats Zell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session passed legislation setting up the state lottery . Barnes , in his first session , pushed a major transportation bill through and came back the next year with a major education reform package . <p> Hooks said Perdue is wise not to come with anything too ambitious . <p> " The overriding issue is the severe budget crisis and reshaping state government to live within our means , " said Hooks . " That 's a big agenda , and to step out beyond those would be a mistake . " <p> Perdue enters this year 's legislative session with fairly positive ratings from the public , which saw him last year balancing babies in one hand , cuddling with foster children and stepping onto the scale and into the national headlines with his plan to put himself and the state on a diet . <p> In a poll conducted in December by Zogby America and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution , 10 percent of Georgians rated Perdue 's performance as excellent , 37 percent said it was good , 35 percent described it as fair and 10 percent considered it poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elementary school principal from Americus who participated in the poll , said he recognizes that Perdue is constrained somewhat by having to deal with a divided Legislature . Still , he said Perdue is not as effective as he had hoped . <p> " I was looking for someone who would bring the state together and lead with a vision , " he said . <p> State Rep. Tom Bordeaux ( D-Savannah ) , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and a vocal Perdue critic , said the governor has a credibility problem with legislators and lobbyists . <p> " He makes his pronouncements for the public 's consumption and , too often , the public has no real option but to accept his sound bite as fact , " Bordeaux said . " The folks who read the fine print at the Capitol , though , know the truth . What he says and what he does are strangers who have n't yet met . " <p> For example , he said , as a candidate Perdue portrayed Barnes as being heavy-handed , too partisan and too political . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the race for speaker of the House , as well as in a legislative race in North Georgia , Bordeaux said . <p> State Rep. Lynn Westmoreland ( R-Sharpsburg ) , who clashed sharply with Perdue over the tax increase proposals last year , said he believes Perdue has learned a lot . <p> " There were some problems with communication last year , " Westmoreland said , " but he 's starting to get his arms around it . I think this is going to be a much better session . " <p> As for Perdue , he describes himself as " improving . " He says he wants to avoid some of the mistakes of the first year . <p> " We 've reached out to both sides very aggressively  --  very purposefully  --  since the session ended , " the governor said . " I think there 's going to be a real majority of legislators who want to move this state forward . "
