<p> IN 1989 , when Gabriel Kazakov was 14 , his family moved to New York from the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan and settled in a rental apartment on the edge of Rego Park in Queens , where thousands of others  --  Bukharian Jews like him and his family  --  transplanted themselves as the Soviet Union collapsed . <p> Now a 32-year-old real estate broker with 5- and 6-year-old daughters , Mr. Kazakov knew when he began searching for a home last year that he need not look beyond the area where he had first become acquainted with the United States . He and his wife , Yelena , bought a co-op with two bedrooms , high ceilings and parquet floors in pleasantly familiar Rego Park , a 1.1-square-mile expanse of central Queens . <p> " We got settled there , grew up there and basically adapted to the environment , " he explained of his affinity for the neighborhood . " All my friends are still in the area . Plus , for kids , it 's safe . " <p> Long the modest cousin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rego Park has lately been buoyed by upwardly mobile immigrants like Mr. Kazakov , who want to remain near their close-knit families and communities . Their cultivation of the neighborhood has had wide-ranging benefits , according to Igor Rafailov , the owner of E-Z Sell Realty and Mr. Kazakov 's boss . <p> " Russian immigrants are buying houses in Rego Park , renovating them in European styles , modernizing them and increasing their property values as well as the neighborhood 's value , " Mr. Rafailov explained . " The difference between Forest Hills and Rego Park is not as tremendous as it used to be . " <p> Rego Park 's Central Asian influence is underscored by aromatic Bukharian restaurants on 63rd Drive and 108th Street . Among the 44,000 residents , according to the last census , nearly 7,000 were of Russian and Central Asian ancestry , while thousands more hailed from China , Korea and Latin America and 17,000 were native-born Americans . Brokers note the common draw of good schools , plentiful shopping , handy transportation and attractive prices . <p> Steven and Jenny Ovadia moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that Forest Hills was out of their price range but Rego Park offered a quiet , desirable alternative . " We found a two-bedroom with a screened terrace and spacious living room  --  " just a nice apartment , " said Mr. Ovadia , 31 , a librarian who previously lived in Astoria . " It was comparable to Forest Hills , but for less money . " <p> Ken Goldstein , a broker with Halstead Property , said that Rego Park , with its well-proportioned , affordable housing stock , is already following in the footsteps of neighborhoods like Jackson Heights in attracting an influx of Manhattanites . <p> It has added assets in terms of shopping , he said , citing the Rego Park Center mall , a New York Sports Club branch that opened in June and a Trader Joe 's store that is set to open this fall in Forest Hills just over the Rego Park border . <p> " I think there 's going to be tremendous interest in that area , " Mr. Goldstein said . " All the indications are right there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queens Boulevard , Rego Park is bounded on the southwest by Woodhaven Boulevard and the southeast by Yellowstone Boulevard . The Long Island Expressway hedges its northwest border . The only boundary that seems subject to debate is to the northeast , where Rego Park meets Forest Hills , and brokers eager to make a sale tend to give borderline properties the wealthier Forest Hills designation . But that line is most often drawn at 108th Street . <p> The neighborhood 's architectural centerpieces are the houses in an area known locally as the Crescents , five semicircular streets that ripple south of the Long Island Rail Road tracks . Exquisite single-family homes are fashioned as Tudors or colonials and affixed with second-floor verandas , dappled stonework and lush gardens . Some renovated homes there have features like marble balustrades and inlaid brick driveways . The streets are narrow , shaded by old trees and edged with sidewalks where children trot to school . <p> Beyond the Crescents , Rego Park offers a melange of other single-family homes , quaint row houses with peaked roofs , and six- or seven-story red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drive and the Long Island Expressway are the white masses of Park City Estates , Park Plaza and Park City 3 and 4 , hulking co-op buildings of up to 16 stories with more than 2,000 apartments . <p> Many of the tenants on 63rd Drive are small retailers like bakeries , dry cleaners , fruit markets and pharmacies ; some have been there for years and command deep loyalty . <p> Recently , national retailers have asserted a presence at Rego Park Center , whose tenants include Marshall 's , Circuit City and Old Navy . Along with the Queens Center mall in Elmhurst to the west , the center has helped establish this section of Queens Boulevard as the borough 's major shopping nexus . <p> Not all national retailers have found the welcome mat rolled out there , however . A plan to build the city 's first Wal-Mart beside Rego Park Center erupted in a political firestorm in 2004 , with City Council members , union leaders and community members in forceful opposition . The plan was scrapped early in 2005 . <p> In May of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Planning , ground was broken on the formerly contested site for a $550 million expansion of Rego Park Center that will include Century 21 , Kohl 's , Home Depot and a 1,400-space parking garage . Although plans for the project 's residential component are not yet firm , the developer , Vornado Realty Trust , envisions as many as 400 apartments . <p> Some people are concerned about traffic at the new mall , which is set to open in 2009 , while others are looking forward to the shops , according to Charles Zsebedics , the manager of Park City Estates . <p> " It 's created a lot of convenience for residents having shopping walking distance away , " said Mr. Zsebedics , referring to the mall 's first phase . " Now you 're going to have additional department stores . They 're basically supportive and feel it will enhance Rego Park . " <p> What You 'll Pay <p> Prices have fluctuated recently , but they still fall safely in the range of what many consider affordable . <p> " A couple years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benjamin Realty , " prices were going as nuts as anywhere in Queens . Now , things are starting to stabilize . " <p> For a co-op apartment , Mr. Grancaric said , buyers can expect to spend $200,000 to $230,000 for a one-bedroom and around $280,000 for a two-bedroom ; sometimes that amount also covers an indoor parking space . He recently sold a one-bedroom co-op for $215,000 in Park City 3 and 4 , a one-bedroom co-op for $215,000 in Park Plaza , and a two-bedroom co-op for $305,000 . A two-family attached house in the area sold for $695,000 . <p> Mr. Rafailov of E-Z Sell Realty noted that the number of condos in the area is increasing . A one-bedroom is likely to sell for $300,000 to $350,000 , he said , while a two-bedroom would be up to $450,000 . <p> Single-family houses tend to sell for $600,000 to $680,000 , according to Damon M. Noland , an agent with Foxtons , who cited the recent sale of a three-bedroom colonial on Alderton Street for $550,000 . In the Crescents , prices range from $800,000 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Halstead Property acknowledged that rentals are sparse , as the area is dominated by co-ops . But among Rego Park 's rentals , he said , a one-bedroom costs around $1,100 a month and a two-bedroom around $1,700 . <p> What to Do <p> Less than a mile from the center of Rego Park is Flushing Meadows-Corona Park , a 1,200-acre trove of activities including baseball , cricket and soccer , as well as fishing and boating on the 84-acre Meadow Lake . <p> Within the park is Shea Stadium , home of the New York Mets , and the National Tennis Center where the United States Open tennis tournament is played every year . In addition , the park houses the Queens Museum of Art , Queens Botanical Garden and New York Hall of Science . <p> There are playgrounds scattered around Rego Park , and there is also Lost Battalion Hall , an indoor recreation facility on Queens Boulevard that includes a fitness room , computer center and Olympic-caliber weightlifting platform . <p> The Schools <p> The neighborhood is home to four public schools that serve kindergarten through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and state tests . At Public School 138 on 63rd Drive , 84 percent of fourth graders met English standards and 97 percent met math standards in 2005 , versus 60 percent and 78 percent citywide . The other schools are P.S. 174 on Dieterle Crescent , P.S. 206 on 97th Place and P.S. 175 on 102nd Street . <p> There is no public high school in Rego Park , but many students attend Forest Hills High School , which had 3,700 students in 2005 and consistently ranks above average . In 2005 , students there averaged 458 on the verbal SAT and 504 on the math ; city averages were 443 and 472 . <p> Other options in Rego Park include Our Saviour Lutheran School and Our Lady-Angelus School ; just beyond neighborhood borders are Resurrection Ascension School and Forest Hills Montessori School . <p> The Commute <p> Residents often cite transportation as one of Rego Park 's best qualities , with the R , V and G subway lines stopping at the 63rd Drive-Rego Park and 67th Avenue stations . The E and F trains stop nearby in Forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road connection to Midtown Manhattan . Drivers cite easy access to the Long Island and Van Wyck Expressways and the Grand Central Parkway . <p> The History <p> Settled in the 17th century by English and Dutch farmers , the area that would become known as Rego Park was later farmed by Germans and then the Chinese , who grew vegetables for sale in Chinatown . <p> In the 1920s , the Real Good Construction Company bought farms south of Queens Boulevard and built houses and apartment buildings there . The area was coined Rego Park as a shortened form of the construction company 's name . <p> Going Forward <p> While the flourishing of Rego Park as a shopping destination is convenient , the proliferation of national retailers may sap customers from small businesses and alter the neighborhood 's atmosphere . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
