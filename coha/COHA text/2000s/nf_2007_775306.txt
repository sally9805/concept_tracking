Uncover Your Yes // " In creating , the only hard thing ? s to begin ; a grass-blade ? s no easier to make than an oak . " - James Russell Lowell // Perhaps the single biggest mistake we make when we say No is to s tart from No . We derive our No from what we are against - the other ? s demand or behavior . A Positive No calls on us to do the exact opposite and base our No on what we are for . Instead of starting from No , start from Yes . Root your No in a deeper Yes-a Yes to your core interests and to what truly matters . // Nowhere did I learn this more clearly than from a relative of mine who suffered from a serious addiction to alcohol that nearly cost him and others their lives in a car accident . He tried many times to give up the habit but always failed . Then at the age of sixty , just when all hope seemed lost , he found in him- self the will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When my first grandchild was born , " he says , " I wanted more than anything to live long enough to see him grow up . It was his birth that motivated me to get treatment and stop drinking . Since then , for over fifteen years now , I have not touched a drop . " His Yes to being present for his grandchildren-to be able to play with them and see them grow-motivated his powerful No to alcohol . // His story serves to illustrate an everyday paradoxical truth : the power of your No comes directly from the power of your Yes . // Your Yes is the underlying purpose for which you are saying No . The first step in the method is to uncover the Yes that lies behind your No . The deeper you go into your core motivation , the more powerful your Yes will be and thus the more powerful your No. // From Reactive to Proactive // The biggest obstacle to saying No successfully is not the other , however difficult they might be . It is ourselves . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but without clear purpose . We humans are reaction machines . And our Nos tend to be reactive . We accommodate out of fear and guilt . We attack out of anger . We avoid out of fear . To get ourselves out of this three-A trap , we need to become proactive , forward-looking , and purposeful . // This challenge is vividly captured in an old Japanese story about a samurai and a fisherman . One day , the samurai went to collect a debt from the fisherman . " I ? m sorry , " the fisherman said , " but this last year has been a very bad one for me , and I regret to say I do not have the money to repay you . " Quick to anger , the samurai drew his sword and prepared to kill the fisherman on the spot . Thinking fast , the fisherman boldly said , " I have been studying martial arts and my master teaches that you should never strike out of anger . " // The samurai looked at him for a minute , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said quietly . " My master used to teach the same lesson . Sometimes my anger gets the better of me . I will give you one more year to repay your debt , but if you fail by even a penny , I will surely kill you . " // The samurai returned to his house , arriving late at night . He crept in quietly , not wishing to wake his wife , but to his shock , he found two people in the bed , his wife and a stranger dressed in samurai clothing . With a surge of jealousy and anger , he raised his sword to slay them both , but suddenly the fisherman ? s words came back to him : " Do not strike out of anger . " The samurai stopped for a moment , took a deep breath , and then deliberately made a loud noise . His wife instantly woke up , as did the " stranger , " who turned out to be his mother . // " What is the meaning of this ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " We were afraid of robbers , " his wife explained . " So I dressed your mother up in your samurai clothes to scare them off . " // A year passed and the fisherman came to see the samurai . " I had an excellent year , so here is your money back and with interest , " the fisherman said happily to him . // " Keep your money , " replied the samurai . " You repaid your debt long ago . " // When you want to say No , remember the samurai ? s lesson : do not react out of anger-or indeed out of any negative emotion such as fear or guilt . Take a deep breath and focus on your purpose-your Yes-in this situation . Ask yourself what you really want and what is really important here . In other words , shift from being reactive focused on No , to being proactive focused on Yes . // This chapter outlines a process that can help you . As the samurai did , you start by stopping and collecting your wits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to say No ? What are your underlying interests , needs , and values ? Once you have answered this question , you can then crystallize your Yes ! - your intention to protect what matters most to you . // Stop : Go to the Balcony // We do not have a chance of being able to influence the other unless we are first able to control our own natural reactions and emotions . // When we want to say No to an offensive behavior or inappropriate demand , it is only natural to feel angry . But anger can blind us . In the rush to say No , angrily and sometimes vengefully , it is all too easy to lose sight of the prize-advancing our interests . Fear too can prevent us from pursuing our objectives . We imagine in advance the other ? s reaction to our No . What will they think of us or do to us ? What will happen to our relationship , to the deal , and thus to our interests ? Paralyzed , we accommodate , giving up on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I to say No ? " " I don ? t deserve the time to myself . " " Their needs are more important than mine . " // Anger can blind , fear can paralyze , and guilt can weaken . // The first challenge we face , therefore , is internal . Recall the example of the man who said No to his domineering father , who was also his boss . In John ? s own words , " I didn ? t stand up to my dad , I stood up to my f ears ! " As John recognized , the real obstacle to getting what he wanted was not his father ; it was his own fears . " All the action was basically over by the time I spoke to him . " That is the key point . The real action of standing up for yourself takes place inside you before you say No. // This internal action starts with stopping . Stopping is all- important because it interrupts your natural reaction , buys you time to think , and thus allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second , an hour , a day , or however long is required . What matters is to stop and get some perspective on the situation before proceeding with your No. // I like to use the metaphor of " going to the balcony . " The balcony is a detached state of mind you can access anytime you choose . Imagine yourself for a moment as an actor on a stage about to speak your lines-your No . Now picture yourself up on a balcony overlooking the stage , a place where you can see the scene clearly from afar . The balcony is a place of perspective , calm , and clarity . From a balcony perspective , it is much easier to uncover the Yes behind your No. // I came to truly appreciate this lesson when I was asked to facilitate a difficult discussion in the mid-1990s between Russian and Chechen leaders about how to end the tragic war in Chechnya . This discussion took place at the Peace Palace in The Hague in the very same conference room used for the international tribunal on war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began his long speech by making a series of vociferous accusations against the Russians , saying they should stay in that room because they themselves would soon be on trial for war crimes . He then turned to me and , looking me right in the eye , began attacking : " You Americans have been supporting the Russians in their war crimes ! And , what is more , you are violating the rights of self-determination of the people of Puerto Rico ! " As he went on with his accusations , others around the table looked at me to see how I would respond . Would I say No to the round of accusations ? // I felt defensive and distracted , thinking , " I don ? t like the turn this conversation is taking . Why is he attacking me ? I ? m just trying to help . Puerto Rico ? What do I know about Puerto Rico ? " I felt reactive . Should I just accept this treatment ? Should I respond in kind ? Should I say nothing at all ? // Fortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the balcony . I took a deep breath and tried to calm myself . Our purpose , I remembered , was to try to bring peace to the people in Chechnya and Russia . That was my Yes . On that basis , I was ready to say No to this vein of accusation that would lead us nowhere . // When my turn came to respond , I simply said to the Chechen vice president , " I hear your criticism of my country and I take it as a sign that we are among friends and can speak candidly with each other . I know your people have suffered terribly . What we are here to do is to find a way to stop the suffering and bloodshed in Chechnya . Let us try to come up with some practical steps that can be taken today . " The discussion got back on track . Going to the balcony enabled me to uncover my Yes . // Take a Time-Out // These days the scarcest resource is time to think . Look for opportunities to go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . // When you want to take a time-out , rote phrases can come in handy . If the other is making an unwanted demand , for instance , you could say : // * " I ? m sorry , but this is not a good time to talk about this . Let ? s talk about it this afternoon . " // * " Let me think about it and I ? ll get back to you tomorrow . " // * " I need to consult my partner . " // * " Let me make a phone call to check something first . " // If the other is behaving offensively , you could use a phrase like : // * " Why don ? t we take a break ? " // * " Time-out for five minutes . " // * " Would you excuse me ? I need a coffee refill . " // Achok , a Tibetan friend of mine , once told me : " ? Yes ? and ? No ? are very important phrases , but another phrase that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes you don ? t know whether to say Yes or No . So the best answer is ? wait a minute , ? which gives you the time to decide . " Achok was right . Before saying No , it is often wise to wait a minute , ? which gives you the time to decide . " Achok was right . Before saying No , it is often wise to wait a minute . // During the time-out , step out of the room for a moment . Use the moment of quite to think or consult with a colleague . Imagine it is a customer pressing you for what you fear may be an unrealistic delivery date . In his presence , you might be inclined to agree , but , after talking with your colleague on the phone , you realize this would be a big mistake . Giving yourself a chance to reflect before responding can make all the difference between a reactive Yes and a proactive No. // If you are feeling angry or fearful , go for a walk or engage in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your heart pumping can help discharge anger and reduce fear so when you say No , you can say it from a place of calm and balance . //
