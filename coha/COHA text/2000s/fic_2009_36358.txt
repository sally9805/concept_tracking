The old woman peered past the red geraniums in her deep front window at the ? gure lingering in the moon-white snow at the gate . In the gloom of the late winter afternoon , Hennie Comfort did not recognize the woman , who stood like a curious bird , her head cocked to one side as she looked at the fence , then the front door , and back at the fence again . Hennie watched , thinking it odd that anyone would wait there , mute as the snow itself . Why would a body stand in the cold when she could come inside by the stove ? <p> Hennie had gone to the window to read her letter in the winter light , because the heavy snow had weighted down the wires , causing the electric to go out . It was too dark inside now to read , although Hennie knew the words would n't be any different from what they were when she read the letter at the post of ? ce that morning . <p> For years , Mae had urged her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 'd made it plain that if Hennie insisted on another winter on the earth 's backbone , Mae would come to Middle Swan herself and pack up her mother and take her below , to Fort Madison on the eastern edge of Iowa . Mae was a loving daughter , but she was as stubborn as Hennie . " You can spend your summers in Middle Swan , Mom , but I insist that from now on , you live with us during the winters . What if you slipped on the ice and broke your leg ? You could freeze to death before somebody found you . " <p> Mae was right , Hennie admitted to herself . If she fell , the snow would cover her up , and nobody would know where she was until she melted out in the spring . It was foolhardy for a person as old as she was to stay another winter on the Swan River . Besides , it was sel ? sh of her to let Mae worry , and Hennie was always sensible of the feelings of others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Mississippi . <p> Hennie set the letter on the table and returned to the window to look at the woman , covered now in white ? akes . She 'd be frozen solid as a fence post if she did n't move soon . So the old woman opened the door and walked into the snow in her stout shoes , her hands tucked into her sleeves . " Hello to you , " she called . <p> The stranger looked up , startled , a little frightened . She was a new-made woman , not much more than a girl , and Hennie had never seen her before . " Oh ! " the stranger said , clasping and unclasping her bare hands , which despite the poor light , Hennie could see were red and chapped . " I do n't mean to be nosy , but I was wondering how much ? " <p> " How much for what ? " <p> " A prayer . " The girl tightened the triangle of plaid wool scarf that covered her head before she thrust her hands into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused for a moment , and then realizing what had confounded the girl , she laughed . " That sign 's been there so long , I forget about it . " <p> " It says , Prayers for Sale . I 'm asking how much do you charge , and is it more if you 're in need than if you 're wanting just a little favor ? Do sinners pay more than the righteous ? And what if the Lord does n't answer ? Do you get your money back ? " The girl asked all this in a rush , as if she did n't want to forget any of the questions she had pondered as she stood frozen- still in the cold . <p> " That sign 's older than God 's old dog . " <p> " How come you to sell prayers ? " <p> " I do n't . " <p> " The sign says so . I 've seen it three times now . I came back because of it , " the girl persisted . " I can pay , if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Hennie chuckled . " That sign 's a story . I 'll tell it to you if you 'll come inside . " <p> " I 've got a nickel . Is that enough for a prayer ? " <p> " Lordy , are you needing one ? No money will buy a prayer , I tell you , but I 'll give you one for free , if you 're in need of it . " Hennie put her arms tight around herself to squeeze out the cold , for she had gone into the storm without her coat . <p> " I need it . I do . " <p> " Just you come inside then and tell me why . " <p> " I ca n't . I 've got to get home and ? x Dick 's supper . But I 'd be obliged to you if you 'd say a prayer  --  a prayer for Sweet Baby Ef ? e , sweet baby that was , that is . Maybe you could ask that wherever she is , she 's not taken with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but just any words will do . " <p> " I 'll ask it , " Hennie said , turning and gesturing toward the house , but the girl would n't follow . Instead , she took a step backward . <p> " I thank you , " she said , carefully laying her nickel on the crosspiece of the fence . Then she turned and ? ed . Rubbing her arms now against the cold , Hennie watched until the little thing disappeared into the storm . Then she picked up the ? ve-cent piece and went inside , placing the coin in a mite box that she kept for Bonnie Harvey to take to church . Hennie herself did n't attend ser vices , had n't in a long time . <p> As she sat down in a kitchen chair , Hennie picked up the letter , but instead of holding it up to the window to read again , she pondered the young girl . Something about her was familiar , although Hennie was sure she 'd never seen her before . It might have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was from the South . Or perhaps it was because the girl was new in Middle Swan and appeared to be not a day older than Hennie herself when she 'd arrived long years before . <p> Hennie looked out the window again , but there was no sign of the girl returning , no sign that she 'd even been there , in fact . The old woman wondered why the girl wanted a prayer ; she seemed to have a powerful desire for one . Well , Hennie knew the need for prayer in her life , and she would do what she could . So slowly , she knelt on her old knees beside the chair , clasped her hands together , and asked God to keep Sweet Baby Ef ? e warm . Then she mumbled , " Now , Lord , there 's a girl , a poor girl , by the looks of her , that 's needing your help  --  and maybe mine , too . I 'd like it right well if you could tell me what to do . " She paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd ? nd a way short of dying to keep me from moving in with Mae .
