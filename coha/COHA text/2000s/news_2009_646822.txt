HOOSICK , N.Y .  --  The midterm elections are more than a year away , but voters who live in the small towns and rolling farms of Upstate New York are providing an early look at how President Obama ' s economic policies may play out on the campaign trail in 2010 . <p> Months before races heat up elsewhere , two candidates here are vying for an open House seat in the nation 's only competitive special election  --  a swing district where the $787 billion stimulus law and bonuses paid to AIG executives have become key issues . The winner may provide a blueprint for how to campaign next year in an election that will decide control of Congress . <p> Democrats built wide majorities in the 2006 and 2008 elections with support from traditionally Republican districts such as this one , and both parties are searching for clues for whether that trend will continue in 2010 . The seat is now vacant because its congresswoman , Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand , was chosen to serve the remaining Senate term of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we move beyond the last four years or not , " said Stuart Rothenberg of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report , which calls Tuesday 's election a tossup . " A lot of politics is mood and momentum , and the Republicans really need a win . " <p> The candidates , Republican James Tedisco and Democrat Scott Murphy , have battled for weeks over Obama ' s response to the economy and now the American International Group bonuses . Both are echoing messages heard in Washington : Murphy says the stimulus is imperfect but necessary to <p> Tedisco also has tried to tie Murphy 's support of the stimulus to AIG because the law includes a provision that allowed the bonuses to be paid . Murphy has countered that Tedisco 's opposition to the stimulus would have cost the state tens of thousands of jobs and killed a tax break intended to benefit middle-income residents . <p> Both candidates have focused on job creation as they hustle for votes at diner counters and small businesses scattered throughout the district . Murphy has visited what Obama calls " shovel-ready " infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled in as a waiter to pitch his jobs platform . <p> " The issue here is all about the economy , " Murphy , 39 , said minutes before speaking at an event this month to tout $1.5 million in stimulus money that will be used to replace a closed , single-lane bridge in the town of Hoosick . " Right now , that 's what everybody in this district is concerned with . " <p> ' Anxious for the future <p> The sprawling 20th Congressional District runs along the Hudson River from the Adirondack Mountains to just north of Poughkeepsie , in the heart of the Hudson Valley . Voters supported then-president Bush in 2004 but backed Obama in 2008 . From 1992 until 2006 , the district sent Republicans to the House . <p> From eastern New Hampshire to southeastern Arizona , retirements , scandals and an unpopular president helped swing dozens of traditionally Republican seats to Democrats in 2006 and 2008 , boosting the party 's voting majority by 67 seats in the House and Senate . In New York 's 20th , Gillibrand won in 2006 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70,632-voter enrollment advantage in the district . But last fall Gillibrand  --  a Democrat who supports gun rights and voted against the $700 billion financial rescue package  --  won re-election with 58% of the vote . <p> The shifting landscape has complicated things for Tedisco , who acknowledges that Obama is popular in the district . While Republicans in Washington roundly criticized the stimulus as wasteful and ineffective  --  it received no GOP House support  --  Tedisco initially took a more nuanced approach and would not say how he would have voted . <p> " The president , maybe rightfully so , is getting the benefit of the doubt right now , " said Tedisco , 58 , before addressing a large crowd of volunteers this month preparing to campaign for him door-to-door . But , he added , " things have not exactly turned around . We 'll know more when we see how some of these things work . " <p> The candidates are now in line with party leadership on the economy , and the race may provide insight into which message is resonating with voters . Tedisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the stimulus includes billions in wasteful spending . Murphy , like Obama , says the economic crisis demands swift action . <p> Republicans have been searching for leadership and direction following the 2008 election . In recent weeks the party has found a mostly consistent voice in opposing Obama ' s plans as too costly and inefficient . While Obama has tried to label the GOP as the " party of ' no , " it is still unclear who is winning the message war . <p> Tedisco , the minority leader in the state Assembly , was 4 percentage points ahead of Murphy in a Siena College poll released this month , but Murphy had narrowed the lead from 12 points in February . Several experts say the economic crisis is the main reason Murphy has a shot . <p> " It 's Obama and the economy that are making this competitive , " said Lee Miringoff , a political scientist and pollster at Marist College . " Short of those forces , this would not be something that would be getting a lot of attention . The economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Many say the economy is by far the most important issue in the race , but also say they are reserving judgment on Obama ' s stimulus . Obama endorsed Murphy on Wednesday , saying in a statement that the Democratic candidate would be " a strong ally in creating jobs and stabilizing the economy . " <p> " This is looking catastrophic , and I think it has a lot of people very anxious for the future because it 's so uncertain , " said Joe Pfeifer , a 57-year-old Hoosick resident attending a St. Patrick 's Day parade with his family . On the stimulus , he said : " If it works it 's great . If it does n't work , it was a really bad idea . " <p> Counting votes along the way <p> Historically , the party in power loses seats in Congress during midterm elections . Since 1978 , the party in the White House has lost congressional seats in six of eight midterms . Counting votes could be crucial as Obama pursues an agenda that , so far , has largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 76-vote margin in the House . The party controls 17 more votes than Republicans in the Senate , however , it is still two votes shy of the 60 needed to avoid GOP filibusters of controversial measures . That has proved critical this year , when Democrats brokered a compromise with three Republican senators to pass the stimulus bill . <p> Two other special elections this year  --  one in California and the other in Illinois  --  will decide who will succeed House members who became part of Obama ' s administration , Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and chief of staff Rahm Emanuel . Neither race is considered competitive because both are Democratic strongholds . <p> In an indication of the national attention the New York race is receiving , Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele visited the district in February and predicted the race would be a " battle royale . " On Wednesday , Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine sent an e-mail to 500 major donors asking them to contribute to Murphy 's campaign , calling the race " important . . . to bring about a lasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money than Tedisco , $899,161 compared with $835,312 , according to Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) reports . Both candidates received a large portion of their contributions from party organizations and candidates across the country . <p> Money flowing into the district has translated into a bitter television ad war . Tedisco aired an ad last week on the AIG bonuses , arguing that because Murphy supported the stimulus he " supported a loophole letting AIG executives keep their bonuses . " The language was a last-minute addition to the bill and did not become widely known until after the company paid bonuses this month . <p> Murphy has suggested in his ad that because Tedisco opposes the stimulus he is against 76,000 jobs for Upstate New York and " the largest middle-class tax cut in American history . " The jobs figure is an estimate that even the Obama administration has said is subject to large margins of error . <p> Outside groups , including the parties , have spent $2 million independently of the campaigns , FEC records show . The National Republican Campaign Committee has used its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one spot that the Democrat has created jobs in India , rather than in the district . The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has tried to cast Tedisco as " just another Albany politician . " <p> One outside group , the National Republican Trust PAC , ran an ad saying that Murphy would support " a radical agenda , " including " trillions in wasteful spending " and " job-killing taxes , " according to the group 's website . The group has spent more than $300,000 on the race since February , FEC records show . <p> Dave Schoenthaler , a 49-year-old engineer , said he wishes both candidates would focus on the issues rather than each other . <p> " I 've kind of got an opinion of distrust for both of them , " said Schoenthaler as he walked out of the Halfmoon Diner , 2 miles from Tedisco 's headquarters . " I would really love to see politics become something that has good candidates ... debating the issues , not attacking each other .
