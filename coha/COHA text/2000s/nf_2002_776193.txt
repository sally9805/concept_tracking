A Young Man from a Good Family // Osama bin Laden flew to Pakistan in January 1980 , just a few days after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . In answering the call to jihad in Afghanistan , bin Laden had given his life a purpose , but he had also irrevocably changed its direction . Who was this rich young Saudi , trained as an engineer , a businessman and pious Muslim , who later said , " One day in Afghanistan counted for more than a thousand days praying in a mosque " ? // Osama bin Laden 's father , Sheikh Mohammed bin Oud bin Laden , an engineer and architect according to some sources , a simple peasant according to others , left his native province of Hadramut in central Yemen in the early 1920s . He is thought to have settled in the Hejaz province of Saudi Arabia in 1932 . There he made a fortune and a name for himself as a scrupulous and honest businessman . It is said that he began working as a laborer and porter before managing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm that would one day get the contract to build the first royal palace in the major Saudi port of Jedda . // Having become wealthy , the head of the bin Laden clan helped the monarchy financially when the Saudi Treasury encountered difficulties ; it is said that he once came up with the funds to guarantee payment of the salaries of government employees . By way of thanks for his services , Mohammed bin Laden 's company was given the contract to rebuild the Haram Sharif mosque in Mecca and to renovate the Masjid al-Nabawi mosque . Mohammed bin Laden , who had become a Saudi subject , was even for a time King Feisal 's minister of public works , but he was also and above all his friend . The consortium of bin Laden enterprises , known as the Bin Laden Corporation , flourished on Saudi oil in the 1970s , and the king ultimately granted it exclusive rights for the construction and renovation of religious buildings . The elder bin Laden 's company secured contracts in several countries in the Arab world , including a project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his engineers submit a bid at cost . According to family legend , the head of the clan decided to reduce the price calculated by his experts even further in order to ensure that God was well served in this mosque in a friendly country . // The piety of Mohammed bin Laden , who was the father of more than fifty children , twenty-five of whom were boys ( he had eleven wives in the course of his life ) , was of another era . For more than forty years , he awaited patiently and without losing hope the coming of the Hazrat Mahdi , a messianic figure in many Muslim traditions . Mohammed bin Laden had even established a charitable fund of about $12 million to assist the Mahdi , were he to appear during bin Laden 's lifetime , in restoring the grandeur and glory of Islam throughout the world . // When bin Laden died in 1972 , King Feisal was still on the throne ; the bin Laden family says that the king , who had wept only twice in his life , shed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cordial relations between the royal family and Mohammed bin Laden benefited his children . This friendship was reinforced when bin Laden 's sons attended the same schools as the numerous sons of King Abdelaziz , notably Victoria College in Alexandria , Egypt . Several of bin Laden 's sons were classmates of the future King Hussein of Jordan or of the Khashoggi brothers , whose father was one of the doctors of the Saudi royal family . // The elder bin Laden was not the only one in the family to enjoy the friendship of King Feisal , and later of King Fahd . Bin Laden 's son Salem was also very close to the king , and it is likely that he rendered significant services to the monarchy , in particular by carrying out secret missions . According to several witnesses , his mysterious death is evidence of this . In 1988 , a BAC III plane piloted by Salem crashed in Texas . His death gave rise to speculations about the exact role he played for King Fahd and the Saudi government in secret operations in the Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an indication from American sources that he was connected to a secret meeting between Iranian and American emissaries in Paris in October 1980 . Some felt that his death was not an accident . // In addition to being close to the king , the bin Ladens were also business and financial mentors to his children . Mohammed bin Fahd and Saud bin Nayef , two of the more enterprising princes in the royal family , became tycoons of finance and industry in the 1980s , under the tutelage of the bin Laden sons , often sitting together on the boards of powerful multinationals financed by petrodollars. // The relationship of trust between the two families was resilient despite a few serious crises . The most important was the seizure of the Great Mosque in Mecca on November 20 , 1979 . The bin Laden construction company had the exclusive contract for repairs to the Holy Places , and its trucks thus had the privilege of entering and leaving Mecca without inspection . It was precisely by using these trucks that the terrorists succeeded in smuggling arms into the mosque . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 50,000 pilgrims were caught inside the Great Mosque by a commando group . The terrorists were led by a man of about thirty , Juhayman al-Otaibi . Just as prayers had barely begun , he deployed nearly 200 armed " brothers " on the seven minarets of the mosque and , using a microphone he had seized , demanded of the faithful at prayer that they recognize one of his associates , Mohammed al-Qahtani , as the Mahdi . Unable to control 50,000 people , the commando group decided to hold only 130 of them hostage , during a siege lasting two weeks . The French police of the GIGN ( Intervention Group of the National Gendarmes ) brought about a resolution of the situation on December 5 , which required some instant conversions to enable the elite gendarmes to enter precincts reserved for Muslims . However , it was by enlisting the bin Ladens , who were then the only ones to have precise plans of the Holy Places , that the Saudi police and the GIGN were able to find their way in the cellars and put down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the bin Laden sons , Mahrous , was arrested because of his ties with the Islamists involved in the assault but was later released . The terrorists had established contact with Mahrous several years earlier , when he was a student in London and when he counted among his friends the son of a Southern Yemeni dignitary , the leader of a very active fundamentalist group . Following this university connection , Mahrous bin Laden became involved with a group of Syrian Muslim Brotherhood activists exiled to Saudi Arabia . The Saudi secret service investigation ultimately declared Mahrous innocent . The investigation stated that by exploiting networks of the young Mahrous 's former friendships , the terrorists had gained access to the bin Laden group 's trucks to organize their attack without the young man 's knowledge . Mahrous now heads the bin Laden group 's subsidiary in Medina. // This tragic episode did not undermine the close ties of the bin Laden clan with the royal family , which consistently showed understanding when members of the bin Laden clan were involved in complex or shady affairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hegira ( 1957 ) , in the al-Malazz neighborhood of Riyadh , is one of the youngest sons of the clan . His mother is said not to have been Mohammed 's favorite wife , and Osama is said not to have been one of the favorite sons of the patriarch . Nonetheless , Osama grew up in the company of about fifty cousins  --  his uncles ' children  --  and a few dozen aunts . He received a traditional education and finished his secondary education in a Jedda high school in 1973. // Like many well-off young Arabs , Osama bin Laden had the opportunity to travel and , according to reports , some of which come from American " profilers " of international criminals , he was in Beirut from 1968 to 1970 along with his brothers Omar , Khaleb , and Bakri , enrolled in a school frequented primarily by students from Persian Gulf countries . There is some debate about Osama 's character and behavior at this time . Some claim that , along with Bakri , Osama gave no evidence of exemplary piety , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Khaleb , who were studious and serious , never missed a prayer , and finally alerted their father to the misdemeanors of Osama and Bakri . The stories of Osama 's escapades are challenged by one of the older brothers , Abdelaziz ; according to him , Osama was devout , self-effacing , and very attached to the values of Islam . According to relatives , moreover , Osama speaks neither English nor French , two languages that would have been indispensable in Beirut at the time for anyone wanting to live a life of pleasure . And if one were to judge by physical appearance , his ascetic figure and his meditative gaze do not argue in favor of a debauched history . // According to other sources , through an arranged marriage in about 1975 , Osama bin Laden took as a first wife a young Syrian to whom he was distantly related . At about the same time he entered King Abdelaziz University . // Bin Laden 's degree completed his formal education and prepared him for an upper-management position in the Bin Laden Corporation . This professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It hardly matters whether the piety was put on at the time for opportunistic reasons or whether it was sincere ; from the time he graduated Osama bin Laden 's religious commitment was vivid and explicit . His father , Sheikh Mohammed , was proud of his pious outlook and entrusted him with the contract for the enlargement of the Masjid al-Nabawi mosque . // On the death of Sheikh Mohammed in 1972 , his children inherited an industrial and financial empire , but there were fifty-four of them . As a further complication in the division of the inheritance , the bin Laden brothers had different mothers and were of different nationalities ( something they made use of to develop the family interests abroad ) . Bakr and Yehia represented the Syrian line of the family ; Yeslam the Lebanese group ; Abdelaziz was the standard bearer of the Egyptian circle and the largest employer of the family , with forty thousand employees . There was also a Jordanian branch , as well as the Saudi branch , of which Osama was the single representative . The clan was frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stake in these internecine battles was of course money , but also , and primarily , power in the financial empire . // After Sheikh Mohammed 's death , continuity was in question . Management of the bin Laden group was taken over temporarily by Mohammed Baharath , brother of patriarch Mohammed bin Laden 's first wife and the oldest of the uncles . Soon thereafter , the oldest son , Sheikh Salem bin Laden , took over the controls with the assistance of several of his brothers . After Salem 's death in 1988 , another brother , Bakr , with thirteen of his brothers , headed up the family group 's board and took up the succession . Tensions began to appear . Ali bin Laden , Bakr 's older brother , who had been dividing his time among Beirut , Damascus , and Paris , moved away from the others . He apparently felt stifled inside the family empire , but , in order not to quarrel with the clan , he claimed private reasons for his departure . This kind of discretion is the norm for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any internal disputes . // The division of the group 's dividends soon became a bone of contention , and Ali had great difficulty in securing his share from his brothers . Mahrous , marked for life by the tragic episode at the Mecca mosque , remained discreetly in the background . Another brother , Yeslam , also distanced himself , but without conflict ; he manages the group 's international activities between Geneva and Paris . He is the most Westernized of the bin Laden sons , perhaps because of his marriage to a Francophone Iranian princess . He travels frequently and , like his brother Salem , flies his own business planes . Within this prosperous and diversified group , Osama bin Laden could choose how to occupy himself and earn money . // In 1976 , four years after the death of the father , the group modernized itself in order to deal with the new requirements of business it had secured in almost every sector , diversifying from construction through imports to industry . The company adopted the name Bin Laden Brothers for Contracting and Industry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranked thirty-second for revenues in Saudi Arabia at the time . It built several tens of thousands of housing units ; it constructed roads , such as a major thoroughfare between Mecca and Medina ; it developed farms and undertook irrigation work . The group also represented major European companies in Saudi Arabia , including Audi and Porsche automobiles . The brothers were associated with distributors of luxury products , such as the Dutch company Pander Projects , but also with the British enterprise Hunting Surveys Ltd. for the construction of prefabricated buildings . // The bin Laden family was known around the world not only for its financial and industrial power but also for its good reputation . At a lunch given by President Jacques Chirac on July 7 , 1996 , in the course of his official visit to Saudi Arabia , Yahya bin Laden , number two in the family hierarchy , was among the guests . // Through its financial investments , the activities of the bin Laden group extend well beyond what is publicly known . As a purely family enterprise without external or institutional shareholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its policy of diversification ; in light of its privileged relations with the king , no one has taken the risk of expressing unhealthy curiosity . Bin Laden contracts are never awarded in cabinet meetings or through a public bidding process ; they are negotiated directly with the royal house and its head chamberlain , Ali bin Mussalem . The bin Ladens , who dislike media exposure , often withdraw without warning from financial or commercial projects when their partners are too talkative . The bin Laden group and its subsidiaries never advertise in the press , and it is impossible for an analyst to gain advance knowledge of its strategy . One motivation for this secretive strategy is that some of the group 's enterprises have served as intermediaries in official arms contracts between Riyadh and the Western powers . // The bin Laden clan carried out several major projects in the Saudi kingdom in the 1980s and 1990s : a $296 million contract for the construction of a ring road around Riyadh ; the construction of housing for security forces in Jedda and Mecca ; the construction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mecca ; the enlargement of the Holy Places in Medina ; and the construction and furnishing of one of the terminals at the Riyadh airport . The bin Ladens were even subcontractors for the construction of hangars during the Saudi-American Desert Shield operation at the time of the conflict with Iraq . // Strange as it might seem given Osama bin Laden 's notoriety by then , in September 1998 , the bin Laden family secured a new contract , for the construction of barracks housing 4,257 American soldiers stationed in the Gulf . This barracks , situated on a Saudi air force base in the desert some 170 kilometers from Riyadh , is a modern building , well designed from the point of view of security ; the promoters of the project were well aware that the American expeditionary force had been badly damaged in 1996 by an attack against the al-Khobar Towers , which the Saudi government had provided to house the Americans . Two years later , the new housing for the American military ( a large number of whom had been living since the attack in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was constructed by the bin Ladens for $150 million , entirely paid by the Saudi government . The security services of the U.S. Central Command went through the building with a fine-tooth comb before installing the airmen who provide support for the air force unit of the Prince Sultan base . // The projects awarded to the bin Laden group are no longer limited to the Saudi kingdom : in Lebanon , Yehia bin Laden is involved in the reconstruction of downtown Beirut devastated by the civil war ; in London the group has a branch office , Binexport ; in Geneva Sico , the Saudi Investment Company , is involved in many international deals . This company , established by the bin Ladens in 1980 , is the flagship for the group 's activities in Europe . It is headed by Yeslam bin Laden , and the board of directors is made up almost exclusively of members of the family clan , except for a Swiss citizen , Baudoin Dunant . This well-known lawyer from French-speaking Switzerland , who is on the boards of several dozen companies , came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swiss banker Fran ? ois Genoud , a controversial figure who had been a disciple of Hitler and sole heir of Goebbels 's copyrights before becoming one of the financiers of the FLN during the Algerian War . The friendships of the bin Ladens sometimes seem surprising , but they are logical : Fran ? ois Genoud has always been pro-Arab. // Sico , as the parent company of the group 's foreign interests , also has offices in London and in Cura ? ao in the Dutch Antilles . The latter outpost , established in 1984 , manages among other things the relations of the bin Laden group with an American company , the Daniels Realty Corporation , a subsidiary of the Fluor Corporation , which , through the influence of the bin Ladens , was awarded many reconstruction contracts in Kuwait after the Gulf War . In France at the time , the bin Ladens were on the board of the Al-Saudi Bank , which was partially taken over by the Indosuez Bank , becoming the Banque Fran ? aise pour l'Orient , before merging with the M ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prime minister . The Al-Saudi Bank facilitated many arms deals in the Middle East beginning in the 1980s. // At present , the group , which remains secretive , still has extraordinary financial resources . The bin Ladens are said to use at least three planes to carry on their business : a King Air 90 Beechcraft registered in the United States belonging to the Saudi Investment Company S.A. ; another plane of the same kind based in Zurich ; and a Challenger III jet , owned by Bin Laden Aviation , registered in the Cayman Islands , the tax haven in the Antilles. // Once the name of Osama bin Laden began to spread through the Western press and intelligence reports , these planes were put under surveillance in various European airports . It turned out that the planes were often used for trips to France via the Cannes-Mandelieu airport . According to airport authorities , this point of entry would allow passengers on the planes to pass through less rigorous inspection than commercial passengers . Investigation revealed that the most frequent flight path for one of the two King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that Yeslam bin Laden often piloted the plane himself . In some years the intelligence services counted as many as two hundred round trips . The Challenger jet , on the other hand , seems to have been used almost exclusively for **27;268;TOOLONG circuits . At least seven other twin-engine jets of the BAC III or Learjet type used by the bin Laden group are said to have been registered in Switzerland for a time and subsequently to have changed registration and nation of ownership . // The frequency of these private flights also led European intelligence services to take an interest in representatives of the bin Laden family in France and Monaco , revealing that at least ten members of the clan regularly circulate among a residential neighborhood in Cannes , the rue Vernet , and the avenue Bosquet in Paris , the posh little town of Chatou in the Paris suburbs , and the boulevard de Suisse in Monaco . Various Western agents involved in this surveillance in Europe suspect that some members of the bin Laden family have not completely broken ties with Osama , particularly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some reports , Osama bin Laden has remained very close to his mother and to one of his brothers who have periodically urged him to give himself up to the Saudi government . //
