" I need to see the blood ! " shouts Mel Gibson . " Your character is going to die soon ! " He picks up a bullhorn : " Attention ! We are all dying here ! We are all dying ! " The Oscar-winning director is standing in a rock quarry near Veracruz , Mexico , shooting a hellish scene for Apocalypto , his action epic about the ancient Maya . Hundreds of local extras  --  many of whom have never seen a movie , let alone acted in one  --  are pounding fake limestone to build a temple used for human sacrifices . Gibson wants one of the extras , covered in white lime dust , to visibly cough up a glob of fake blood . But something keeps getting lost in translation . Take after take , the young man , who speaks only Spanish , politely covers his mouth as he hacks . A second candidate for the role does the same . Gibson finally lets out a tortured howl , digs vainly for a cigarette in his empty pack of Camels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does his best to convey the passion of the Mel . <P> The blasts turn to laughs soon after when , to lighten the mood , Gibson has the crew bring out a stuffed jaguar and leads the extras running away in mock terror . But later he admits to TIME , which this month was given the first look at Apocalypto 's production , that the utter inexperience of most of the cast is a price he 's paying for the authentic feel he wants in the film , in which dialogue is spoken solely in Yucatec Maya . If people were imagining that Gibson , 50 , might coast a little after his 2004 movie , The Passion of the Christ , inspired not only months of controversy but also nearly $1 billion worth of ticket sales , the director has given his answer : Nope . If anything , this film is a more ambitious project than The Passion  --  although success does make some things a mite easier . Gibson had to walk a via dolorosa to find a distributor for The Passion and ended up distributing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pictures needed only to read Apocalypto 's script before signing on to release it in early August . <P> The Passion experience  --  especially the part in which critics hurled anti-Semitism charges at Gibson , an ultraconservative Roman Catholic whose father has questioned whether the Holocaust happened  --  thickened Gibson 's hide along with his wallet . So if there are complaints about Apocalypto 's portrayal of human sacrifice by the Maya , whose mostly impoverished descendants today are a cause clbre for liberals , Gibson says he wo n't care . " After what I experienced with The Passion , I frankly do n't give a flying f about much of what those critics think . "
