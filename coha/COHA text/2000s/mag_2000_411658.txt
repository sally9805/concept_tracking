THE NHL FINALS Headnote Dallas has built a team to win the one-on-one battles , and winning those fierce matchups will help it capture its second straight championship // A wide smile crosses the face of Stars G.M. Bob Gainey when he is asked what he thinks when he sees defenseman Derian Hatcher go one-on  --  one with a Peter Forsberg , Jaromir Jagr , Claude Lemieux or Alexander Mogilny . " Is n't that what hockey is all about ? " he says . " A lot of teams scout players on sheer talent alone , how he shoots the puck , what kind of passer he is and how well he can skate . Honestly , I think there are too many intangibles that you want at this time of the year that you ca n't overlook when you are scouting . " When the Dallas Stars go out to scout a player , we ask : Can he respond to a one-on-one challenge , whether it 's offensively or defensively , because that 's the kind of player you are going to need to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " roster , you notice first and foremost the players are all competitors . Hard work and great instincts are at the top of the intangibles that Gainey and coach Ken Hitchcock want from their players on every shift . If you do n't win the little battles , your opponent will win the war . " Think about it like an NBA matchup of skills for 48 minutes , " says Stars center Guy Carbonneau , a winner of three Stanley Cups . " Mike Modano takes pride in beating the player he 's matched up against , just like Derian Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk , Sergei Zubov and Darryl Sydor do , all the way down to my checking line . " Hatcher , listening in , says , " Yeah , NBA . I 'm like Shaq . My job is to block out the lane in front of the net , whether it 's blocking a shot or just physically keeping a player away from the net . " You get the idea . The Stars are the perfect blueprint for a championship team . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a keen awareness of intangibles  --  most notably , a knack of being able to master their opponents in one-on-one battles all over the ice . The Stars ' mastery in the intangibles will become perfectly clear as we size up the most interesting matchups and battles in the Stanley Cup finals . Photograph THE RIGHT STUFF : Players like Hatcher ( left ) and Hull have all the tools needed to help Dallas win . // Goaltending It 's good to see Martin Brodeur back in the finals after falling out of favor with some in midseason . If Brodeur gains confidence early , he could steal the series for the Devils . But the Stars are masters at tip-ins and crowding the net , two factors Brodeur had trouble with in the conference finals . As for Stars ' Ed Belfour , well , get him two goals and he usually wins . This is too close to call . Defensemen No one is playing better than Scott Stevens right now Unfortunately for the Devils , rookie Brian Rafalski can be overpowered , and Ken Daneyko will lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the key . He has the quickness to have an impact offensively and defensively-and he needs to be a force both ways for New Jersey to win . The Stars know they 're going to get consistency and grit from Hatcher and Matvichuk , which should take New Jersey 's No. 1 line of Jason Arnott , Patrik Elias and Petr Sykora out of play . That leaves Zubov and Sydor to take center stage for Dallas . Edge to the Stars . Forward Second-line players Claude Lemieux and Bobby Holik , along with Scott Gomez , must have the series of their lives . Call it the gang mentality , if you will , but New Jersey 's forwards have to carry out every detail of Larry Robinson 's game plan to perfection-every night . That means no passengers , no free rides . The Devils ' forwards must match the consistency the Stars have received from Mike Modano and Brett Hull through the playoffs . Look for Joe Nieuwendyk to be the big-game player he was in the playoffs last year , this time against the defensive pairing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's checking unit carries out its assignments . Coaching Hitchcock likes to talk about how his system borrows from the old Canadiens ' way of doing things . He has Gainey and assistant coaches Rick Wilson and Doug Jarvis to pick their brains about the old Habs . However , Robinson played that system . Lived it , in fact . If anyone can out  --  Montreal the Stars , it 's Robinson . He rallied to motivate his troops with the temper tantrum to beat all tantrums after Game 3 of the conference finals . The edge here goes to Dallas , however , for the meticulous game-planning by Hitchcock . Photograph IN YOUR FACE ! No one is playing better  --  or with more oomph  --  than Stevens right now . Photograph BE LIKE MIKE : Modano can be counted on game after game , play after play . // Special teams This is as close to an outright victory as New Jersey is going to gear The Flyers ' vaunted power play was stifled by New Jersey . Stevens again leads the charge here . Give the Devils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is as good as done . But this comparison is no better than even considering the passion Dallas ' penalty killers put into neutralizing power plays . The rookies Brenden Morrow is a throwback . He was n't part of the injection of youth the Stars added after winning it all last season , getting called up to the NHL in midNovember . But he began working his way up to Mike Modano 's No. 1 line with a gritty temperament and nose for the net . Morrow is dating the daughter of veteran Guy Carbonneau , and you do n't get Carbonneau 's blessing unless you 're the right kind of guy-and Morrow is the kind of guy you 'd trust with your daughter . Photograph GREAT SCOTT : Gomez has shown creativity and production . Photograph DEVIL MAY CARE : Brodeur took some heat at midseason , but he 's doing just fine now . // On the other side of the ledger are New Jersey 's rookies . There 's Calder candidate Scott Gomez , third-line center John Madden , who tied a rookie record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rafalski . If this matchup was taking place earlier this season , you could be certain Gomez would be the difference because of his creativity and production . But the Alaska native 's playmaking skills have not consistently had the same impact as they did in the first couple of months of the season . Madden never stops . He 's quick , carries out his assignment and gets a pat on the back from his coach nearly every night . Rafalski ? He traveled to Helsinki , Finland , because scouts thought he was too small and too light to lav defense in the NHL . He has proved them wrong , making the cut as Scott Stevens ' defense partner in training camp with his ability to move the puck and instincts on defense . // Stars death chart Devils depth chart // DEVILS vs . STARS // A smoking gun Last year , Brett Hull scored the controversial goal that decided the Stanley Cup-an in-the  --  crease goal that almost everyone in hockey considered illegal-and this year he led the playoffs in scoring heading into the finals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkable is that his goals have been , as they say in this business , huge . Tying goals , winning goals . One of the biggest was the series winner in the first round , when the Stars eliminated Edmonton . " He has , " Oilers coach Kevin Lowe said at the time , " an uncanny ability to do squat the whole game and come up with big goals late . " Hull still calls the game " boring " and yearns to return to the 1990s , when he scored 494 goals , including one 86-goal season with St. Louis . " I wish , " he says , " I was still a pure goal scorer , but you 're not allowed to be that any more . " I think it 's in the back of my mind when I come to the rink that the game is going to change , and it 's not going to be such a struggle to go out there and have fun and it 'll be the way it used to be . But it is n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the precision of a marksman firing tranquilizer darts , a stark contrast to the decade when 40-goal seasons were common and Hull came off the wing with rapid-fire abandon . Ten-shot nights were frequent , and Hull recalls those days with a twinge of sadness . " The longer he 's been here , " linemate Mike Modano says , " I think he 's learned that nobody takes shortcuts here . You do your job offensively and defensively , or you do n't play That 's a big change for Brett , but he 's seen how it works for this team and he 's bought into the system because of that . " Bottom line : The Stars have what it takes to outlast the Devils . Dallas in five . Sidebar Why it 's in the Stars Stars coach Ken Hitchcock says his team reminds him of the mysteries that other Hitchcock used to put on the screen . But the ending of this Stanley Cup series will be no surprise . Here are five reasons why Dallas will win the Cup : 1 . Ed Belfour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in seven consecutive games like Belfour did in the Western Conference finals , it becomes clear that Crazy Eddie is the Stars ' best player , at the time of year your goalies needs to be . 2 . Deep D. Hatcher , Matvichuk , Zubov and Sydor are the deepest , grittiest and most talented defensive foursome in the NHL . They do it all , at both ends of the ice . 3 . Reading between the lines . New Jersey 's offense is unpredictable  --  and more than one line has to be productive . Modano and Hull are good every night , and someone is going to be the hero for the Stars , who get production from more than one line each night . 4 . No benchwarmers . In the playoffs , coaches become doubly important . For much of the Eastern Conference finals , it looked like Robinson was being outcoached by Craig Ramsay . That ca n't happen against Hitchcock , who may not be Scotty Bowman at making in-game adjustments , but he 's one of the smartest game-planners in the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real city . Heck , so is Fort Worth . The Devils were built in the marshes of New Jersey , on exit 16W off the turnpike . The Stanley Cup ca n't be lost in the same neighborhood as Jimmy Hoffa , can it ? Sidebar Devils notebook FOLLOW THE LEADER : This postseason , Scott Stevens is finally getting his due . He set the tone with an outstanding first-round series . Then he continued to lead with some punishing hits-sidelining , at various points , Daymond Langkow and Eric Lindros-and some outstanding defensive play . Mostly , though , he has been a leader-something he has n't always been known for . " The first thing I did when I took over for Bobbie ( Ftorek ) was reiterated that so much was being said that Scotty has the " C , ' but we do n't have a leader , " Devils coach Larry Robinson says . " That 's the first thing we straightened out because Scotty is a leader . " And if the Devils win the Stanley Cup , everyone will know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'll be a lock finally to lift an individual trophy-the Conn Smythe as the playoff MVP . ... The Devils ' top line of Patrik Elias , Jason Arnott and Petr Sykora is nothing if not consistent . The trio combined for 82 goals in the 82-game regular season . Then they added 17 more in the Devils ' first 17 playoff games . The rest of the forwards had combined for 20 goals in the playoffs heading into the Stanley Cup finals . SEE A DIFFERENT GAME : As good as the Devils ' defense is , it is n't without its problems . The third pairing of rookie Colin White and enigmatic Vladimir Malakhov is extremely shaky-and that 's when it 's at its best The two had a terrible Game 7 against the Flyers , and its amazing they did n't cost the Devils a goal , let alone the game . Malakhov in particular made an art form of attempting risky passes-a few of which started Flyers rushes the other way . White , at least , should get better . Malakhov-whom the Devils acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect Josh DeWolf  --  is almost a lock to be lost as a free agent in July . - Ralph Vacchiano Stars notebook OLDER , WISER : The Stars boast lots of Stanley Cup experience , with veterans Guy Carbonneau and Mike Keane leading the way with three Cup rings . Keane , who has played in five straight Western Conference finals , entered the finals having played in 96 playoff games in five years . With the Stars reaching the finals and assuming he is not injured , Keane will become the first player to compete in 100 playoff games in a five-year stretch . When he gets to Game 4 , Keane will have passed former Islanders Butch Poring ( 99 ) , Denis Potvin ( 98 ) , Bryan Trottier ( 96 ) and Ken Morrow ( 96 ) . Wayne Gretzky and the rest of those great Edmonton players topped out at 87 Keane did it with two teams-Colorado and Dallas . ... The Stars ' average of two goals per game was the lowest for a winner of a conference finals ( or its former equivalent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Red Wings scored 10 goals in seven games , an average of 1.43 . ... Defenseman Sergei Zubov missed the first round against Edmonton but has been a strong force since returning . His power-play goal in the first period against Colorado continued his strong play in Game 7s of conference finals ; he 's 3-1 in those games . SEE A DIFFERENT GAME : Stars roolde Jon Sim got his first start in the playoffs in Game 7 against the Avalanche . Ken liftchcock will use the 5-10 fireplug when he 's desperate for goals because Sim is an aggressive wing who can create chances in front of the net . In fact , he racked up 291 points in three OHL seasons with Sarnia . Although the Stars are a veteran-laden team , Hitchcock has no problem playing rookies . " Young players are oblivious to this stuff , " Hitchcock says of playoff pressure . " They do n't worry about what could have gone wrong because not much has gone wrong yet . They have n't earned a right to carry baggage yet . " - Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE SPORTING NEWS . // <p>
