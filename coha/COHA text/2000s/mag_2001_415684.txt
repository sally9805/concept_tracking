Thirty movies later , what are we to think of Woody Allen ? // DEPENDING ON WHETHER HIS EARLY GOOF What 's Up Tiger Lily ? makes the list , Woody Allen'g upcoming The Curse of the Jade Scorpion will be either the thirieth or the thirty-first feature he 's directed , plugging away on a self-imposed schedule of roughly one Woody per annum that neither snow nor heat nor gloom of Mia has derailed since 1969 . Despite the hush-hush aura that always cloaks Allen 's projects  --  clearly a manuerism by now , as it 's been decades since people were actually curious about them  --  word is that the cast is the usual clutch of eclectic ringers , including Helen Hunt , Charlize Theron , Dan Aykroyd , and Elizabeth Berkley ( what , no Katie Holmes ? ) , and that it 's a comic jewel heist set in the 1940s . Whenever Allen deals with crooks-a seemingly anomalous interest , but one that 's cropped up regularly in his work since Take the Money and Run-it 's usually his way of being folksy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is n't asking us yet again to contemplate his own life , loves , and injured genius-his piques and valets . No other American director is as celebrated for making movies steeped in his own circumstances and personality . But the self-regard that he disguises as selfscrutiny probably just bewilders moviegoers too young to recall the impact his voluble skittishness had a generation ago . Unless Dianne Wiest saying " Do n't speak " in Bullets Over Broadway counts , this onetime lodestar 's last real contribution to the trove of cultural tropes we live by was probably 1983 's expert little postmodern fantasy Zelig-whose title character 's name is still a byword , and whose central gimmick Forrest Gump shamelessly swiped . Otherwise , it took his private life 's eruption into early-nineties tabloid fodder , thanks to his bright idea of two-timing longtime consort Farrow with her adopted daughter-something Mia was bound to discover Soon-Yi or late-yi , no ? - to make him riveting again . Even so , his reputation has n't merely survived the scandal . If anything , it 's grown , flourishing almost independently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's negligible recent films . That is n't only because David Lee Roth 's crack about rock critics liking Elvis Costello because they all look like Elvis Costello has always gone double with the " Woodman " -a nickname only critics use , wistfully affirming an intimacy that Allen does n't invite and the big audience does n't share . At sixty-five , he fills the culturati 's need for an Old Master . Martin Scorsese is the only other active candidate for the gig , and it 's probably not incidental that they 're the two most New York  --  identified movie directors around ; the special stature both enjoy is due partly to East Coast chauvinism keeping a West Coast art form in its place . My main beef , though , is that intellectuals would n't find Allen such a congenial old Master if he had n't devoted his career to behaving like their preconception of one . He may not be a genius , but he 's a perfect , almost Zeligish facsimile ; he 's been Buster Allen and Ingmar Allen and Federico Allen , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention in his personal life , where some concern for the humdrum decencies would have been welcome , but he 's stayed hopelessly in hock to received wisdom in his artistic values-the area where great artists can and should break the rules . Aesthetically , he 's a reactionary for whom very little art of any merit or beauty , his own films presumably excepted , has appeared in the world since , say , 1972 , the year Bergman 's Cries and Whispers came out . Even aside from his own retro bent , he 's like a lot of notables , in that time seems to have frozen for him the moment fame provided a refrigerator . It 's especially noticeable because the confluence of cultural vogues that turned him into a movie director was so peculiar and fleeting . Only in the chic , intellectually polyglot sixties would an interloping oddity like Woody have either looked attractive to a studio or approached the medium with his particular pretensions-pretensions that he started out burlesquing to hilarious effect , only to shift to indulging them in too many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never fade , and Manhattan , which I thought was magical until I made the mistake of hurrying back to the theater to see it again a week later . Because Allen is either unwilling or unable to update his frame of reference , he 's increasingly shown himself to be something fatal for a satirist and a would-be moralistnamely , clueless about how people live . Forget the embarrassment of 1998 's Celebrity , his out-of-touch indictment of the contemporary scene . Even a deliberately slight caper flick like last year 's Small Time Crooks seemed caught in a fifties time warp . Worse yet , the moral turned out to be that insufferable old crapola about how the little people should be content with their lot instead of fatuously aspiring to higher things , particularly those of them that Woody himself proves he 's not one of by treasuring . It 's a message every bit as patronizing as his apparent calculation that this hackneyed little farce was his best bet to reingratiate himself with ticket buyers , even if the box-office receipts proved him right . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his attempts to find new creative wiggle room have been more interesting than the public 's general boredom with him would indicate . Allen 's basic repertoire of situations and attitudes is now so old hat that his later films have often resorted to arbitrary formal devices to simulate novelty : the documentary conceit in Husbands and Wives , the yuk-it-up Greek chorus in the vague Mighty Aphrodite . But the mock-musical framework of Everyone Says I Love You , however derivative-it was one more trip to Dennis Potter 's field-really did liven things up , gracefully pegging Woody 's jones for upper-crust couth and swank as the Eloise-and-Salinger fairy tale it had been all along and making something genuinely celebratory out of his familiar take on romance 's quiddities and vagaries . More pleasurable still was Bullets Over Broadway , Allen 's best film of the nineties . Much as the Hitchcock pastiche of Manhattan Murder Mystery put a fresh spin on his standard treatment of dissatisfied couples by letting them act out instead of talk out their problems , the jazz  --  age setting here got him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Cusack sat gabbing with his bohemian cronies , it was the same damn conversation Allen 's characters had been having for decades ; yet it was suddenly charming , because their prattle was presented as a curio from an intellectual age of innocence . As if the movie 's richly informed affection for a bygone era was enough to allay Allen 's perennial fear that he 's lowering himself by being funny , it was also his most uninhibited comedy since the early seventies , waltzing through slapstick bits and gaga plot turns with surefooted flair . True , you could n't help but be curious as to whether any of Woody 's several shrinks noticed that Crimes and Misdemeanors , Manhattan Murder Mystery , and Bullets Over Broadway all hinge on the murder of a troublemaking woman . ( Maybe he talked to a different one about each . ) He 's made a fetish out of heroines he can idealize as simple souls-nontroublemakers so docile that they make your favorite Teletubby look like Susan Sontag . We have Woody 's own ungentlemanly word for it that Soon-Yi is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time with a mental deficient ? " he said in Time magazine in 1992 . So you wonder how she felt about being symbolically depicted as a literal dummy in Sweet and Lowdown , one of Allen 's most self-serving portraits of the artist  --  with boorish , insecure jazz guitarist Sean Penn redeemed not only by the beautiful music he leaves behind but by the adoration of a pure-hearted mute who advertises her placid relation to life 's bounty by stuffing her face in every scene . ( Curiously , he 's got a real thing about women and food in his films ; when he shares a meal with one , it 's code for sexual intimacy , which is why you 're alarmed when his Crimes and Misdemeanors character goes for pizza with his adolescent niece . ) Allen has clearly reached a stage when he thinks he 's shortchanging his own genius by not presenting it as both a given and a topic onscreen . Yet the less his recent films have engaged with his personal history and crotchets , the more tolerable they 've been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carping , overly familiar face , even Sweet and Lowdown went down easy after an atrocity like Deconstructing Harry , in which Allen played yet another autobiographical stand-in : a novelist whose messed-up , selfish life shrank into insignificance in an astonishingly narcissistic finale that featured all his fictional characters thanking him for inventing them . One reason this was incongruous is that creating a great gallery of characters is n't what Allen 's known for . Another is that while his fantasy reprises of his own career take his greatness as an artist for granted , they usually omit the decisive fact that he 's a world-famous one whose efforts have n't exactly gone unrewarded . Apart from Stardust Memories , a nasty movie whose repellent streak seems at least partly intentional , his many depictions of the creative life have always shied away from portraying the ultimate perk of creative success : power . Denying that he has any may be his most necessary lie-and Annie Hall 's famous flashback to Woody in the bumper cars may have been more prescient than it looked . It 's clearly decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his system ; they are his system . But that does n't mean we ca n't have regrets : If only he 'd realized that Manhattan was an ending , not a blueprint . If only he 'd gotten interested in something . I 'd have loved to see his movies about politicians , say , or business . ( Or even sports , which he does like . ) It 's too bad this workaholic cares more about being perceived as an artist than he does about creating art .

Opens June 6. - ELIZABETH EINSTEIN Sidebar TWO DVDS TO BUY Platoon and Salvador were conspicuously absent from the mammoth Oliver Stone Collection box set , but now they 've gotten the deluxe DVD treatment they deserve . Since we 're especially fond of the oft-overlooked Salvador , we asked Stone Sidebar how he got such angry performances from James Woods and the rest of the cast . " It did n't take a lot of doing , because where we were shooting in the middle of Mexico was probably the worst place on earth , " he says . " There was no luxury . And everything was going wrong every day , so it did n't take a lot to irritate the cast . They were in an angry mood from the get go . And there were so many unforeseen difficulties , interruptions , strikes . They were getting calls from their agents in the States saying their paychecks were n't going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit better-more organized , more money . " A very little bit better .

" Yet on May 21-after what 's actually been only 12 years but counts as forever in the show 's special neverland-Baywatch will go meet the big wave , having covered the whole range of human experience , from wet suits to thongs , in scripts that combined the purposefulness of computer-game briefings with the insights of Mentos ads .
