<p> JUST WONDERING ... : IN A CITY STARVED FOR ANSWERS , NO QUESTION GOES UNASKED <p> Provoking debate is a necessary staple of newspapers and talk radio . The best sports story is the one that gets talked about on the radio . The best sports radio segment is the one that gets written about in the newspaper . Or so it seems . <p> Why do we keep asking Dusty Baker to state his case for staying or not staying with the Cubs ? Because if we do n't , someone else will . In an era in which the definition of news is **30;2603;TOOLONG , it 's impossible for us to contain ourselves in the quest for the story . We do n't stop ourselves because we ca n't . It 's what we do . <p> So let the debates rage on : <p> - Can the White Sox live with Brian Anderson in center field ? <p> Of course they can . The Sox are the highest-scoring team in the American League . If they do n't have room for a light-hitting center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the playoffs . <p> - Are the Sox chasing the Tigers , or fending off the Red Sox/Yankees and Twins ? <p> Does it really matter ? Wild-card teams have won three of the last four World Series . The Sox would lose home-field advantage in the ALDS and ALCS , but they were 6-0 on the road in the playoffs last year . And there is no team they have to avoid . <p> - Should the Bears turn to Brian Griese at quarterback ? <p> You mean , after he blitzed the backups on a 49ers defense that ranked last in the NFL last year for two touchdowns in the first preseason game ? Sure , why not . <p> Rex Grossman has n't proved much in his three years with the Bears . How about letting the guy breathe a little to see what he can do ? <p> - Should the Cubs retain Baker ? <p> If you were to assess blame for the most recent Cubs demise , it would go something like this : 50 percent to Jim Hendry for putting together a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go with rookie pitchers clearly in over their heads ; 30 percent to injuries to too many key players and 20 percent to Baker for failing to get the most out of what he had left and running a loose ship when he needed a tight one . <p> Still , the 2007 Cubs are almost certain to be more young than old <p>  --  not the kind of team Baker wins with . That said , if Dusty goes , the clock also has to start ticking on Hendry . <p> CASE FOR CARLOS : SIZING UP Z 'S CY YOUNG CHANCES <p> Carlos Zambrano 's goal of winning the Cy Young Award was a joke in April and a long shot in July . But it might be 50-50 or better today . <p> With his 3-0 victory over Houston on Monday night , Zambrano took another step toward the head of the class in the race for the National League 's Cy Young Award . He 's 13-5 with a 3.38 ERA . <p> In a year of mediocrity in the National League ( only the Mets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a poor team might not hinder Zambrano . And in a balanced competition , the numbers are starting to turn Zambrano 's way . <p> - Zambrano is 13-3 with a 2.89 ERA since April  --  on a team that is 37-58 since then . The Diamondbacks ' Brandon Webb  --  the leading candidate in some circles  --  is 5-4 with a 3.59 ERA since the end of June . <p> - Of the top contenders among starting pitchers , Zambrano has pitched with the lowest run support . He ranks 23rd , behind the Diamondbacks ' Webb ( 5 ) , the Dodgers ' Brad Penny ( 7 ) , The Mets ' Tom Glavine ( 8 ) and the Cardinals ' Chris Carpenter . <p> - Zambrano is tied for second in the NL in lowest batting-average-against ( a stellar .205 , with Pedro Martinez , who has pitched 48 fewer innings ) . But his walks jump his WHIP ( walks/hits to innings pitched to 1.30  --  18th among NL starters . <p> - Zambrano has allowed only two stolen bases in 170* innings this season  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not had a Cy Young Award winner since Greg Maddux in 1992 , when the Cubs were 78-84 , in fourth place , for Jim Lefebvre . <p> HIS FIRST MNF : KORNHEISER GETS CRITICISM POST-HASTE <p> As a " Monday Night Football " " analyst , " Tony Kornheiser is no Dennis Miller . <p> That 's good . <p> He 's no Howard Cosell , either . <p> That 's bad . <p> Kornheiser , the Washington Post sports columnist and co-host of ESPN 's " Pardon The Interruption , " received mixed reviews for his MNF debut in Monday 's Raiders-Vikings preseason game  --  as if you can actually review anything after one performance . <p> Probably the biggest insult came from his own paper . " It was enough to make one yearn for Dennis Miller , " wrote Paul Farhi of the Washington Post . " Kornheiser mostly spluttered , typically emphasizing the obvious and playing third fiddle to his more experienced mike mates . " <p> Farhi also said Kornheiser looked " washed out " on television and advised him to " get a tan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry Stewart of the Los Angeles Times was almost glowing in his praise , calling Kornheiser the " star " of the show . <p> " He was the focal point of the telecast , and all things considered , he not only survived but was pretty good , " Stewart wrote . " He came across as less obnoxious than Howard Cosell and funnier than Dennis Miller . " <p> Other reviews : <p> USA Today : " Kornheiser was n't funny , but he was n't annoying . " <p> Douglas Rowe , Associated Press : " Tony Kornheiser had to be better than the short-lived sitcom loosely based on his life . And he was . Much better . And that 's even putting aside such a low standard as ' Listen Up . " ' <p> Richard Sandomir , New York Times : " Kornheiser ... fit in well . He did n't sound scripted and never appeared so eager to get his air time that he trampled on Joe Theismann 's . " <p> Still , it 's only preseason . If you thought Kornheiser was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was great , he 'll get worse . As long as Miller is the measuring stick and not Cosell , he 'll be in for a long run . <p> ONE STEP AT A TIME : BARBARO GOES OUT FOR A STROLL <p> Barbaro is still beating the odds . <p> The Kentucky Derby winner , who suffered a catastrophic and life-threatening injury in the <p> Preakness , was allowed to graze outside his intensive-care unit this week at the New Bolton Center in Kennett Square , Pa . <p> " It 's a big step to know he feels good enough that you can take him out of the stall and walk him around like a normal horse and he eats grass like a normal horse , " said Dr. Dean Richardson , the chief surgeon at the University of Pennsylvania facility . " That does n't mean he 's healed . It just means things are going well right now . " <p> Barbaro 's condition has been touch-and-go since he shattered his right hind leg in the opening strides of the Preakness . He also developed laminitis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was encouraged that Barbaro is gaining weight and has a good attitude . But it remains to be seen whether the 3-year-old will survive . <p> " He 's got to get his left hoof to the point where it 's a solid structure that can sustain long-term weight bearing , " Richardson said . " Could there still be some major things resulting in him having to be put down ? Yes . He 's absolutely not out of the woods yet . " <p> LEINART SIGNS : ARIZONA 'S GREEN GETS HIS MAN <p> Arizona Cardinals coach Dennis Green pulled a Mike Ditka , and may have convinced quarterback Matt Leinart to end his two-week holdout . <p> After keeping quiet through the holdout , a frustrated Green finally let the kid have it when he met the media after practice on Monday . <p> " The offer we got on the table right now , it 's an outstanding contract , " Green said . " When you put $14 million on the table for the 10th pick of the draft , that is a lot more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Hours later , Leinart signed a six-year contract that agent Tom Condon said includes $14 million in guaranteed money and could be worth $51 million . Leinart said Green 's rant was not a factor in ending the holdout . <p> One sticking point , according to the Arizona Republic , was an escalator clause that would determine the value of the fifth and sixth years of the contract  --  a part of the deal he 'll probably never see . Either he 'll be good enough in his first four years that he 'll get a new deal , or the Cardinals will be ready to move on to the next guy . It 's a negotiating tack that gets agents future clients , but can do a disservice to the player holding out . <p> There 's no better example than the Bears ' Cade McNown in 1999 . Condon held McNown out 12 days for escalators and voidable years . McNown came to camp late , never bonded with teammates , got hurt , played 25 games over two years and was out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AWARD : <p> STARTERS <p> Pitcher W-L ERA WHIP BAA RS <p> Brandon Webb , Diamondbacks 13-4 2.77 1.15 .258 6.01 <p> Brad Penny , Dodgers 13-5 3.48 1.23 .258 5.83 <p> Tom Glavine , Mets 12-5 3.92 1.39 .276 5.80 <p> Carlos Zambrano , Cubs 13-5 3.38 1.30 .205 5.22 <p> RELIEF PITCHERS <p> Pitcher SAVES RECORD ERA WHIP BAA <p> Trevor Hoffman , Padres 31/35 0-2 2.22 0.96 .210 <p> Jason Isringhausen , Cardinals 29/37 3-5 3.08 1.37 .200 <p> Billy Wagner , Mets 28/33 3-2 2.44 1.10 .205 <p> RS : Run support ( runs per nine innings while pitcher of record ) <p> BAA : Batting average against .
