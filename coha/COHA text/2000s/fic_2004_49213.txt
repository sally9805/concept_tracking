Peter S. Beagle is , of course , the author of A Fine and Private Place and The Last Unicorn . His last appearance in our pages was a lifetime ago , when we reprinted " Come , Lady Death " in our Aug. 1966 issue . His recent projects are too numerous to list ( go to www.peterbeagle.com for a full account of them ) but they include receipt of France 's Grand Prix de l'Imaginaire for The Rhinoceros Who Quoted Nietzsche , a forthcoming children 's book to be illustrated by Leo and Diane Dillon , a new audiobook of The Last Unicorn ( read by Mr. Beagle ) , and he 's currently working on a novel entitled Summerlong . Mr. Beagle 's new story will strike some familiar chords with those of you who have read Giant Bones or The Innkeeper 's Song , but you need n't have read either of those books in order to enjoy this chase . <p> I NEVER WENT BACK TO MY room that night . I knew I had an hour at most before they would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at my belt , and in my pockets was all I took - that , and all the tilgit the cook could scrape together and cram into my pouch . We had been friends since the day I arrived at that place , a scrawny , stubborn child , ready to die rather than ever admit my terror and my pain . " So , " she said , aslburstinto her kitchen , " Running you came to me , twenty years gone , blood all over you , and running you leave . Tell me nothing , just drink this . " I have no idea what was in that bottle she fetched from under her skirts and made me empty on the spot , but it kept me warm on my way all that night , and the tilgit - disgusting dried marshweed as it is - lasted me three days . Looking back , I shiver to think how little I understood , not only the peril I was in , but the true extent of the power I fled . I did know better than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sailor in a convent ; but if I had had the brains of a bedbug , I 'd never have tried to cut through the marshes toward the Queen 's Road . In the first place , that grand highway is laced with tollbridges , manned by toll-collectors , every four or five miles ; in the second , the Queen 's Road is so well-banked and pruned and well-maintained that should you be caught out there by daylight , there 's no cover , nowhere to run - no rutted smuggler 's alley to duck into , not so much as a proper tree to climb . But I did n't know that then , among other things . What I did understand , beyond doubt , was that they could not afford to let me leave . I do not say escape , because they would never have thought of it in such a way . To their minds , they had offered me their greatest honor , never before granted one so young , and I had not only rejected it , but lied in their clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them again and again of my bewildered gratitude , unworthy peasant that I was . And even then I did know that they were not deceived for a single moment , and they knew I knew , and blessed me , one after the other , to let me know . I dream that twilight chamber still-the tall chairs , the cold stone table , the tiny green tintan birds murmuring themselves to sleep in the vines outside the window , those smiling , wise , gentle eyes on me - and each time I wake between sweated sheets , my mouth wrenched with pleas for my life . Old as I am , and still . If I were to leave , and it became known that I had done so , and without any retribution , others would go too , in time . Not very many - there were as yet only a few who shared my disquiet and my growing suspicions - but even one unpunished deserter was more than they could afford to tolerate . I had no doubt at all that they would grieve my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cook hid me in the scullery , covering me with aprons and dishrags . It was not yet full dark when I left , but she felt it risky for me to wait longer . When we said farewell , she shoved one of her paring knives into my belt , gave me a swift , light buffet on the ear , said , " So . On your way then , " pushed me out of a hidden half-door into the dusk , and slapped it shut behind me . I felt lonelier in that moment , blinking around me with the crickets chirping and the breeze turning chill , and that great house filling half the evening sky , than I ever have again . As I say , I made straight for the marshes , not only meaning to strike the Queen 's Road , but confident that the boggy ground would hide my footprints . It might indeed have concealed them from the eyes of ordinary trackers , but not from those who were after me within another hour . I knew little of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally heard this whisper or that behind this or that slightly trembling hand . Just once , not long after I came to that place , I was sent to the woods to gather kindling , and there I did glimpse two small brown-clad persons in a tree . They must have seen me , but they moved neither foot or finger , nor turned their heads , but kept sitting there like a pair of dull brown birds , half-curled , half-crouched , gazing back toward the great house , waiting for something , waiting for someone . I never saw them again , nor any like them ; not until they came for me . Not those two , of course - or maybe they were the same ones ; it is hard to be sure of any Hunter 's age or face or identity . For all I know , they do not truly exist most of the time , but bide in their nowhere until that place summons them into being to pursue some runaway like me . What I do know , better than most , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill them . I had killed once before - in my ignorance , I supposed the cook was the only one who knew - but I had no skill in it , and no weapon with me but the cook 's little knife : nothing to daunt those who now followed . I knew the small start I had was meaningless , and I went plunging through the marshes , increasingly indifferent to how much noise I made , or to the animals and undergrowth I disturbed . Strong I was , yes , and swift enough , but also brainless with panic and hamstrung by inexperience . A child could have tracked me , let alone a Hunter . That I was not taken that first night had nothing to do with any craft or wiliness of mine . What happened was that I slipped on a straggling tilgit frond ( wild , the stuff is as slimy-slick as any snail-road ) , took a shattering tumble down a slope I never saw , and finished by cracking my head open against a mossy , jagged rock . Amazingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawl off into a sort of shallow half-burrow at the base of the hill . There I scraped every bit of rotting vegetation within reach over myself , having a dazed notion of smothering my scent . I vaguely recall packing handfuls of leaves and spiderwebs against my bleeding wound , and making some sort of effort to cover the betraying stains , before I fainted away . I woke in the late afternoon of the next day , frantically hungry , but so weak and sick that I could not manage so much as a mouthful of the tilgit . The bleeding had stopped - though I dared not remove my ragged , mushy poultice for another full day - and after a time I was able to stand up and stay on my feet , just barely . I lurched from my earthen shroud and stood for some while , lightheaded yet , but steadily more lucid , sniffing and staring for any sign of my shadows . Not that I was in the best shape to spy them out - giddy as I was , they could likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their empty hands , as they can do . But they were nowhere to be seen or sensed . I drank from a mucky trickle I found slipping by under the leaves , then grubbed my way back into my poor nest again and slept until nightfall . For all my panicky blundering , I knew by the stars that I was headed in the general direction of the Queen 's Road , which I continued to believe meant sanctuary and the start of my new and blessedly ordinary life among ordinary folk . I covered more distance than I expected that night , for all my lingering faintness and my new prudence , trying now to make as little noise as possible , and leave as little trace of my passage . I met no one , and when I went to ground at dawn in a riverbank cave - some sheknath 's winter lair , by the smell of it - there was still no more indication of anyone trailing me than there had been since I began my flight . But I was not fool enough to suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped , which was just as bad . The Queen 's Road was farther away than I had supposed : for all the terrible and tempting knowledge that I and others like me acquired in that place , practical geography was unheard of . I kept moving , trailing after the hard stars through the marshes as intently as the Hunters were surely trailing me . More than once , the bog sucked both shoes off my feet , taking them down so deeply that I would waste a good half-hour fishing for them ; again and again , a sudden screen of burly jukli vines or some sticky nameless creepers barred my passage , so I must either lower my head and bull on through , or else blunder somehow around the obstacle and pray not to lose the way , which I most often did . Nearing dawn of the fourth day , I heard the rumble of cartwheels , like a faraway storm , and the piercing squawk , unmistakable , of their pashidi drivers " clan-whistles along with them , and realized that I was nearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely as I feared , was this to be the end of the game - were they poised to cut me down as I raced wildly , recklessly , toward imaginary safety ? Did they expect me to abandon all caution and charge forward into daylight and the open , whooping with joy and triumph ? They had excellent reason to do so , as idiotic a target as I must have made for them a dozen times over . But even idiots - even terrified young idiots - may learn one or two things in four days of being pursued through a quagmire by silent , invisible hounds . I waited that day out under a leech-bush : few trackers will ever investigate one of those closely ; and if you lie very still , there is a fairish chance that the serrated , brittle-seeming leaves will not come seeking your blood . At moonset I started on . Just as the ground began to feel somewhat more solid , just as the first lights of the Queen 's Road began to glimmer through the thinning vegetation ... there they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each standing away at an angle , making me the third point of a murderous triangle . They simply appeared - can you understand ? - assembling themselves out of the marsh dawn : weaponless both , their arms hanging at their sides , loose and unthreatening . One was smiling ; one was not - there was no other way to tell them apart . In the dimness , I saw laughter in their eyes , and a weariness such as even I have never imagined , and death . They let me by . They turned their backs to me and let me pass , fading so completely into the gray sunrise that I was almost willing to believe them visions , savage mirages born of my own fear and exhaustion . But with that combination came a weary understanding of my own . They were playing with me , taking pleasure in allowing me to run loose for a bit , but letting me know that whenever they tired of the game I was theirs , in the dark marshes or on the wide white highway , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my age , I am entitled to forget what I forget - terror and triumph alike , grief and the wildest joy alike - and so I have , and well rid of every one of them I am . But that instant , that particular recognition , remains indelible . Some memories do come to live with you for good and all , like wives or husbands . I went forward . There was nothing else to do . The marshes fell away around me , rapidly giving place to nondescript country , half-ragged , halfway domesticated to give a sort of shoulder to the road . Farmers were already opening their fruit and vegetable stands along that border ; merchants " boys from towns farther along were bawling their employers " wares to the carters and wagoners ; and as I stumbled up , a sAuJai-trainer passed in front of me , holding his arms out , like a scarecrow , for folk to see his sharp-toothed pets scurrying up and down his body , and more of them pouring from each pocket as he strode along . Ragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveler turned his head as I slipped onto the Queen 's Road . On the one hand , I blessed their unconcern ; on the other , that same indifference told me clearly that none of them would raise a finger if they saw me taken , snatched back before their eyes to that place and whatever doom might await me there . Only the collectors at their tollgates might be at all likely to mourn the fate of a potential contributor - and I had nothing for them anyway , which was going to be another problem in a couple of miles . But right then was problem enough for me : friendless on a strange road , utterly vulnerable , utterly without resources , flying well , trudging - from the only home I had known since the age of nine , and from the small , satisfied assassins it had sent after me . And out of tilgit as well . The Queen 's Road runs straight all the way from Bitava to Fors na " Shachim , but in those days there was a curious sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remnant of the original wagon-road , beginning just before the first tollgate I was to reach . I could see it from a good distance , and made up my mind to dodge away onto it - without any notion of where the path might come out , but with some mad fancy of at once eluding both the killers and the collectors . Sometimes , in those nights when the dreams and memories I can not always tell apart anymore keep me awake , I try to imagine what my life would have been if I had actually carried my plan through . Different , most likely . Shorter , surely . Even this early , the road was steadily growing more crowded with traffic , wheeled and afoot , slowing my pace to that of my closest neighbor - which , in this case , happened to be a bullock-cart loaded higher than my head with jejebhai manure . Absolutely the only thing the creatures are good for ; we had a pair on the farm where I was a boy - if I ever was , if any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as close to the cart as I could , hoping that it would hide me from the toll-collectors " sight when I struck off onto that odd little bend . My legs were tensing for the first swift , desperate stride , when I heard the voice at my ear , saying only one word , " No . " A slightly muffled voice , but distinctive - there was a sharpness to it , and a hint of a strange cold amusement , all in a single word . I whirled , saw nothing but the manure cart , determined that I had misheard a driver 's grunt , or even a wheel-squeak , and set myself a second time to make my move . Once again the voice , more insistent now , almost a bark : " No , fool ! " It was not the driver ; he never looked at me . I was being addressed commanded - by the manure pile . It shifted slightly as I gaped , and I saw the eyes then . They were gray and very bright , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could make out of the face in which they were set was a thick white mustache below and brows nearly as heavy above . The man - for it was a human face , I was practically sure - was burrowed as deeply into the jejebhai dung as though he were lolling under the most luxurious of quilts and bolsters on a winter 's night . he beckoned me to join him . I stopped where I was , letting the cart jolt past me . The sharp voice from the manure was clearer this time , and that much more annoyed with me . " Boy , if you have any visions of a life beyond the next five minutes , you will do as I tell you . Now . " The last word was no louder than the others , but it brought me scrambling into that cartload of muck faster than ever I have since lunged into a warm bed , with a woman waiting . The man made room for me with a low , harsh chuckle . " Lie still , so , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallest row , and we will pass the gate like royalty . And those who follow will watch you pass , and never take your scent . Thank me later - " I had opened my mouth to speak , but he put a rough palm over it , shaking his white head . " Down , down , " he whispered , and to my disgust he pushed himself even farther into the manure pile , all but vanishing into the darkness and the stench . And I did the same . He saved my life , in every likelihood , for we left that gate and half a dozen like it behind as we continued our malodorous excursion , while the driver , all unwitting , paid our toll each time . Only with the last barrier safely past did we slide from the cart , tumble to the roadside and such cover as there was , and rise to face each other in daylight . We reeked beyond the telling of it - in honesty , almost beyond the smelling of it , so inured to the odor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter , and that was what we did then , grimacing and howling and falling down on the dry grass , pointing helplessly at each other and going off again into great , ridiculous whoops of mirth and relief , until we wore ourselves out and could barely breathe , let alone laugh . The old man 's laughter was as shrill and cold as the mating cries of shukris , but it was laughter even so . He was old indeed , now I saw him in daylight , even under a crust of filth and all that still stuck to the filth - straw , twigs , dead spiders , bullock-hair . His own hair and brows were as white as his mustache , and the gray eyes streaked with rheum ; yet his cheeks were absurdly pink , like a young girl 's cheeks , and he carried himself as straight as any young man . Young as I was myself , and unwise as I was , when I first looked into his eyes , I already knew far better than to trust him . And nonetheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " I think we bathe , " he said to me . " Before anything else , I do think we bathe . " " I think so too , " I said . " Yes . " He jerked his white head , and we walked away from the Queen 's Road , off back into the wild woods . " I am Soukyan , " I offered , but to that he made no response . He clearly knew the country , for he led me directly to a fast-flowing stream , and then to a pool lower down , where the water gathered and swirled . We cleaned ourselves there , though it took us a long time , so mucky we were ; and afterward , naked-new as raw carrots , we lay in the Sun and talked for a while . I told truth , for the most part , leaving out only some minor details of that place - things I had good reason not to think about just then - and he ... ah , well , what he told me of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that dungheap , was such a stew of lies and the odd honesty that I 've never studied out the right of it yet , no more than I have ever learned his own name . The truth is not in him , and I would be dearly disappointed if it should show its poor face now . He was there - leave it at that . He was there at the particular moment when I needed a friend , however fraudulent . It has happened so since . " So , " he said at last , stretching himself in the Sun . " And what 's to be done with you now ? " - for all the world as though he had all the disposing of me and my future . " If you fancy that your followers have forsaken you , merely because we once stank our way past them , I 'd greatly enjoy to have the writing of your will . They will run behind you until you die - they will never return to their masters without you , or whatever 's left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I know that well enough , " said I , trying my best to appear as knowledgeable as he . " But perhaps I am not to be taken so easily . " The old man snorted with as much contempt as I have ever heard in a single exhalation of breath , and rolled to his feet , deceptively , alarmingly graceful . he crouched naked on his haunches , facing me , studying me , smiling with pointed teeth . " Without me , you die , " he said , quite quietly . " You know it and I know it . Say it back to me . " I only stared , and he snapped , " Say it back . Without me ? " And I said it , because I knew it was true . " Without you , I would be dead . " The old man nodded approvingly . The yellow glint was stronger in the gray eyes . " Now , " he said . " I have my own purposes , my own small annoyance to manage . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many a time - never think otherwise - but it suits me to share roads with you for a little . It suits me. " he was studying me as closely as I have ever been considered , even by those at that place , and I could not guess what he saw . " It suits me , " he said for a third time . " We may yet prove of some use to each other . " " We may , or we may not , " I said , more than a bit sharply , for I was annoyed at the condescension in his glance . " I may seem a gormless boy to you , but I know this country , and I know how to handle myself . " The first claim was a lie ; of the second , all I can say is that I believed it then . I went on , probably more belligerent for my fear : " Indeed , I may well owe you my life , and I will repay you as I can , my word on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... sir , I hope only to put the width of the world between myself and those who seek me - I have no plans beyond that . Of what your own plans , your own desires may be , you will have to inform me , for I have no notion at all . " He seemed to approve my boldness , at any rate , he laughed that short , yapping laugh of his and said , " For the moment , my plans run with yours . We 're dried enough - dress yourself , so , and we 'll be off and gone while our little friends are still puzzling over how we could have slipped their grasp . They 'll riddle it out quickly enough , but we 'll have the heels of them a while yet . " And I could not help finding comfort in noticing that " your followers " had now become " our little friends . " So we ourselves were allies of a sort , united by common interests , whatever they were . Having no goal , nor any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real choice but to go where he led , since on my own the only question would have been whether I should be caught before I stumbled into a swamp and got eaten by a louiijakh . For all his age , he marched along with an air of absolute serenity , no matter if we were beating our way through some near-impenetrable thornwood or crossing high barrens in the deepest night . Wherever he was bound - which was only one of the things he did not share with me - we encountered few other travelers on our way to it . An old lone wizard making his lamisetha ; a couple of deserters from someone 's army , who wanted to sell us their uniforms ; a little band of prospectors , too busy quarreling over the exact location of a legendary hidden drast mine to pay overmuch attention to us . I think there was a water witch as well , but at this reach it is hard to be entirely sure . By now I would not have trusted my woodcraft for half a minute , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new friend had enough of that for the pair of us . Every night , before we slept - turn and turn about , always one on watch - and every morning , before anything at all , he prowled the area in a wide , constantly shifting radius , clearly going by his nose as much as his sight and hearing . Most of the time he was out of my view , but on occasion I would hear a kind of whuffling snort , usually followed by a low , disdainful grunt . In his own time he 'd come trotting jauntily up from the brushy hollow or the dry ravine , shaking his dusty white hair in the moonlight , to say , " Two weeks , near enough , and not up with us yet ? Not taking advantage of my years and your inexperience to pounce on us in the dark hours and pull us apart like a couple of boiled chickens ? Indeed , I begin to lose respect for our legendary entourage - as stupid as the rest , they are , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not imagine then . Respect the Hunters or no , he never slackened our pace , nor ever grew careless in covering our tracks . We were angling eastward , into the first folds of the Skagats - the Burnt Hills , your people call them , I believe . At the time I had no name at all for them , nor for any other feature of this new landscape . For all the teachings I had absorbed at that place , for all the sly secret knowledge that was the true foundation of the great house , for all the wicked wisdom that I would shed even today , if I could , as a snake scours itself free of its skin against a stone ... nevertheless , then I knew next to nothing of the actual world in which that knowledge moved . We were deliberately kept quite ignorant , you see , in certain ways . He ridiculed me constantly about that . I see him still , cross-legged across the night 's fire from me , jabbing out with a long-nailed forefinger , demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that you 've never heard of the Mildasi people , or the Achali ? You know the lineage , the lovers and the true fate of every queen who ever ruled in Fors - you know the deep cause of the Fishermen 's Rebellion , and what really came of it - you know the entire history of the Old Arrangement , which can not be written - but you have absolutely no inkling where Byrnarik Bay 's to be found , nor the Northern Barrens , nor can you so much as guess at the course of the Susathi . Well , you 've had such an education as never was , that 's all I can say . And it 's worthless to us , all of it worthless , nothing but a waste of head-space , taking up room that could have been better occupied if you 'd been taught to read track , steal a horse , or shoot a bow . Worthless . " " I can shoot a bow , " I told him once . " My father taught me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you when you loose off . " There was a deal more of that as we journeyed on . I found it tedious most often , and sometimes hurtful ; but there was a benefit , too , because he began taking it on himself to instruct me in the nature and fabric of this new world - and this new life , as well - as though I were visiting from the most foreign of far-off lands . Which , in ways even he could not have known , I was . One thing I did understand from the first day was that he was plainly a fugitive himself , no whit different from me , for all his conceit . Why else would he have been hiding in a dung-cart , eager to commandeer the company of such a bumpkin as I ? Kindly concern for my survival in a dangerous world might be part of it , but he was hardly combing our backtrail every night on my behalf . I knew that much from the way he slept - when he slept - most often on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air , running and running behind his closed eyes , just as a hound will do . I knew it from the way he would cry out , not in any tongue I knew , but in strange yelps and whimpers and near-growls that seemed sometimes to border on language , so close to real words that I was sure I almost caught them , and that if he only kept on a bit longer , or if I dared bend a bit closer , I 'd understand who - or what - was pursuing him through his dreams . Once he woke , and saw me there , studying him ; and though his entire body tensed like a crossbow , he never moved . The gray eyes had gone full yellow , the pupils slitted almost to invisibility . They held me until he closed them again , and I crept away to my blanket . In the morning , he made no mention of my spying on his sleep , but I never imagined that he had forgotten . So young I was then , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was quite right - none of it was to prove the smallest use in the world I entered on our journey . That nameless , tireless , endlessly scornful old man showed me the way to prepare and cook aidallah , which looks like a dungball itself , which is more nourishing than tilgit , and tastes far better , and which is poisonous if you do n't strip every last bit of the inner rind . he taught me to carry my silly little knife out of sight in a secret place ; he taught me how to sense a sheknath 's presence a good mile before winding it , and - when we were sneaking through green , steamy Taritaja country - how to avoid the mantraps those cannibal folk set for travelers . ( I was on my way over the lip of two of them before he snatched me back , dancing with scorn , laughing his yap-laugh and informing me that no one would ever eat my brain to gain wisdom . ) And , in spite of all my efforts , I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Oriskany plains . There is n't a wound they ca n't clean out , nor an infection they ca n't digest ; but it is not a comfortable process , and I prefer not to speak of it any further . Nevertheless , more than once I have come a very long way to find them again . But cunning and knowing as that old man was , even he could detect no sign of the Hunters from the moment when we joined fortunes on the Queen 's Road . Today I 'd have the wit to be frightened more every day by their absence ; but then I was for once too interested in puzzling out the cause of my companion 's night terrors , and the identity of his pursuers to be much concerned with my own . And on the twentieth twilight that we shared , dropping down from the Skagats into high desert country , I finally caught sight of it for a single instant : the cause . It stalked out of a light evening haze on long bird legs - three of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creature leaned back on it briefly , regarding us - but it definitely had long toes or claws of its own . As for the head and upper body ; I had only a dazed impression of something approaching the human , and more fearsome for that . In another moment , it was gone , soundless for all its size ; and the old man was up out of a doze , teeth bared , crouching to launch himself in any direction . When he turned to me , I 'd no idea whether I should have seen what I had , or whether it would be wisest to feign distraction . But he never gave me the chance to choose . I can not say that I actually saw the change . I never do , not really . Never any more than a sort of sway in the air - you could not even call it a ripple - and there he is : there , like that first time : red-brown mask , the body a deeper red , throat and chest and tail-tip white-gold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soukyan , always the same seeing me truly and terribly , all the way down . Always . The fox . One wild glare before he sprang away into the mist , and I did not see him again for a day and another night . Nor the great bird-legged thing either , though I sat up both nights , expecting its return . It was plainly seeking him , not me - whatever it might be , it was no Hunter - but what if it saw me as his partner , his henchman , as liable as he for whatever wrong it might be avenging ? And what if I had become a shapeshifter 's partner , unaware ? Not all alliances are written , or spoken , or signed . Oh , I had no trouble staying awake those two nights . I thought it quite likely that I might never sleep again . Or eat again , either , come to that . As I have told you , I never went back to my room at that place , which meant leaving my bow there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only because I had killed a man with that bow when I was barely tall enough to aim and draw , but because without it ; on my own , I was bound to go very hungry indeed . I stayed close to our camp - what point in wandering off into unknown country in search of a half-mad , half-sinister old man ? - and merely waited , making do with such scraps and stores as we had , drinking from a nearby waterhole , little more than a muddy footprint . Once , in that second night , something large and silent crossed the Moon ; but when I challenged it there was no response , and nothing to see . I sat down again and threw more wood on my fire . He came back in human form , almost out of nowhere , but not quite - I never saw that change , either , but I did see , far behind him , coming around a thicket beyond the waterhole , the two sets of footprints , man and animal , and the exact place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not care whether I saw it or not . he sat down across from me , as always , took a quick glance at our depleted larder , and said irritably , " You ate every last one of the sushal eggs . Greedy . " " Yes . I did . " Formal , careful , both of us , just as though we had never shared a dung-cart . We stared at each other in silence for some while , and then I asked him , most politely , " What are you ? " " What I need to be , " he answered . " Now this , now that , as necessary . As are we all . " I was surprised by my own sudden fury at his blandly philosophical air . " We do not all turn into foxes , " I said . " We do not all abandon our friends - " I remember that I hesitated over the word , but then came out with it strongly - " leaving them to face monsters alone . Nor do we all lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done to me . I have no use for you , and we have no future together . Come tomorrow , I go alone . " " Well , now , that would be an extremely foolish mistake , and most probably fatal as well . " He was as calmly judicial as any human could have been , but he was not human , not human . he said , " Consider - did I not keep you from your enemies , when they were as close on your heels as your own dirty skin ? Have I not counseled you well during this journey you and I have made together ? That monster , as you call it , did you no harm - nor even properly frighted you , am I right ? Say honestly . " I had no fitting answer , though I opened my mouth half a dozen times , while he sat there and smiled at me . " So . Now . Sit still , and I will tell you everything you wish to know . " Which , of course , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " What you saw-that was no monster , but something far worse . That was a Goro. " he waited only a moment for me to show that I knew the name ; quite rightly not expecting this , he went on . " The Goro are the bravest , fiercest folk who walk the Earth . To be killed by a Goro is considered a great honor , for they deign to slay only the bravest and fiercest of their enemies - merely to make an enemy of a Goro is an honor as well . However short-lived . " " Which is what you have done , " I said , when he paused . he looked not at all guilty or ashamed , but distinctly embarrassed . " You could say that , I suppose , " he replied . " In a way . It was a mistake - I made a serious mistake , and I 'm not too proud to admit it , even to you . " I had never heard him sound as he did then : half-defiant , yet very nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . he said , " I stole a Goro 's dream . " I looked at him . I did not laugh - I do n't recall that I said anything but he sneered at me anyway . His eyes were entirely gray now , narrow with disdain , and somewhat more angled than I had noticed before . " Mock me , then - why should you not ? Your notion of dreams will have them all gossamer , all insubstantial film and gauze and wispy vapors . I tell you now that the dream of a Goro is as real and solid as your imbecile self , and each one takes solid form in our world , no matter if we recognize it or not for what it is . Understand me , fool ! " he had grown notably heated , and there was a long silence between us before he spoke again . " Understand me . Your life may well depend on it . " For just that moment , the eyes were almost pleading . " It happened that I was among the Goro some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen . " In all the time that we have known each other , he has never spoken the word fox , not to me. he said , " A Goro 's dream , once dreamed , will manifest itself to us as it chooses - a grassblade or a jewel , a weed or a log of wood , who knows why ? In my case .. . in my case - pure chance , mind you - it turned out to be a shiny stone . The shape likes shiny things . " His voice trailed away , again a guilty child 's voice . " So you took it , " I said . " Blame the shape , if you like - no matter to me - but it was you did the stealing . I may be only a fool , but I can follow you that far . " " It is not so simple ! " he began angrily , but he caught himself then , and went on more calmly . " Well , well , your morality 's no matter to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen dream cries out to its begetter . No Goro will ever rest until his dream is safe home again , and the thief gathered to his ancestors in very small pieces . Most often , some of the pieces are lacking . " he smiled at me . " A grassblade ? " I demanded . " A stone - a stick of wood ? To pursue and kill for a discarded stick , no use to anyone ? You neglected to mention that your brave , fierce Goro are also quite mad . " The old man sighed , a long and elaborately despairing sigh . " They are no more mad than yourself - a good deal less so , more than likely . And a Goro 's dream is of considerable use - to a Goro , no one else . They keep them all , can you follow that ! A Goro will hoard every physical manifestation of every dream he dreams in his life , even if at the end it seems only to amount to a heap of dead twigs and dried flower petals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clutter to his gods , when he goes to them . And if even one is missing - one single feather , candle-end , teacup , seashell fragment - then the Goro will suffer bitterly after death . So they believe , and they take poorly to having it named nonsense . Which I am very nearly sure it is . " When he was not railing directly at me , his arrogance trickled away swiftly , leaving him plainly uneasy , shapeshifter or no . I found this rather shamefully enjoyable . I said , " So . This one wants his shiny stone back , and it has called him all this way on your trail . It does seem to me - " " That I might simply return it to him ? Apologies - some small token gift , perhaps - and no harm done ? " This time his short laugh sounded like a branch snapping in a storm . " Indeed , nothing would suit me better . It is only a useless pebble , as you say - the shape lost all interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a Goro - such a sin , if you like - vengeance is required . " Speaking those words silenced him again for a long moment : his eyes flicked constantly past and beyond me , and his whole body had grown so taut that I half-expected him to turn back into a fox as we sat together . For the first time in our acquaintance , I pitied him . " Vengeance is required , " he repeated presently . " It is a true sacrament among the Goro ; much more than a matter of settling tribal scores . Something to do with evening all things out , restoring the proper balance of the world . Smoothing the rumples , you might say . Very philosophical , the Goro , when they have a moment . " he was doing his best to appear composed , you see , though he must have known I knew better . he does that . " All as may be , " I said . " What 's clear to me is that we now have two different sets of assassins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Goro are not assassins , " he interrupted me . " They are a civilized and honorable people , according to their lights . " he was genuinely indignant . " Splendid , " I said . " Then by all means , you must stay where you are and allow yourself to be honorably slaughtered , so as to right the balance of things . For myself , I 'll give them a run , in any case , " and I was on my feet and groping for my belongings . Wonderful , what weeks of flight can do for a naturally mild temper . He rose with me , nodding warningly , if such a thing can be . " Aye , we 'd best be moving . I ca n't speak for your lot , but the day 's coming on hot , and our Goro will sleep out the worst of it , if I know them at all . Pack and follow . " That brusquely - pack and follow . And so I did , for there was no more choice in the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fierce pace that day , not only demanding greater speed from me than ever , but also doubling back , zigzagging like a hare with a shukri one jump behind ; then inexplicably going to ground for half an hour at a time , absolutely motionless and silent until we abruptly started on again , with no more explanation than before . During those stretches he often slipped out of sight , each time hissing me to stillness , and I knew that he would take the fox-shape ( or would it take him ? which was real ? ) to scout back along the way we had come . But whether we were a trifle safer , or whether death was a little closer on our heels , I could never be sure . he never once said . The country continued high desert , simmering with mirages , but there were moments in the ever-colder nights when I could smell fresh water ; or perhaps I felt its presence in the water composing my own body . The old man did finally reveal that in less than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nai , the greatest river in this part of the country , which actually begins in the Skagats . There are always boats , he assured me - scows and barges and little schooners , going up and down with dried fish for this settlement , nails and harness for that one , a full load of lumber for the new town building back of the old port . Paying passengers were quite common on the Nai , as well as the non-paying sort - and here he winked elaborately at me , looking enough like the grandfather I still think I almost remember that I had to look away for a moment . Increasingly , as the years pass , I prefer the fox-shape . " Not that this will lose our Goro friend , " he said , " not for a moment . They 're seagoing people - a river is a city street to the Goro . But they dislike rivers , exactly as a countryman dislikes the city , and the farther they are from the sea , the more tense and uneasy they become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Druchank , which is a hellpit , unless it has changed greatly since I was last there . But from Druchank it 's a long , long journey to the smell of salt , yet no more than two days to .... " And here he stopped . It was not a pause for breath or memory , not an instant 's halt to find words - no interruption , but an end , as though he had never intended to say more . he only looked at me , not with his usual mockery , nor with any expression that I could read . But he clearly would not speak again until I did , and I had a strong sense that I did not want to ask what I had to ask , and get an answer . I said , at last , " Two days to where ? " " To the place of our stand . " The voice had no laughter in it , but no fear either . " To the place where we turn and meet them all . Yours and mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am reasonably certain that I did not say anything bold or heroic in answer , as I can be fairly sure that I did not shame myself . Beyond that .. . beyond that , I can only recall a sense that all the skin of my face had suddenly grown too tight for my head . The rest is stories . he might remember exactly how it was , but he lies . I do recollect his response to whatever I finally said . " Yes , it will come to that , and we will not be able to avoid facing them . I thought we might , but I always look circumstance in the eye . " ( And would try to steal both eyes , and then charge poor blind circumstance for his time , but never mind. ) he said , " Your Hunters and my Goro - " no more sharing of shadows , apparently - " there 's no shaking them , none of them . I would know if there were a way . " I did n't doubt that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which we make our stand , and I have long since chosen the Mihanachakali . " I blinked at him . That I remember , blinking so stupidly , nothing to say . The Mihanachakali was deep delta once - rich , bountiful farmland , until the Nai changed course , over a century ago . The word means black river valley - I suppose because the Nai used to carry so much sweet silt to the region when it flooded every year or two . You would n't know that now , nor could I believe it at the time , trudging away from Druchank ( which was just as foul a hole as he remembered , and remains so ) , into country grown so parched , so entirely dried out , that the soil had forgotten how to hold even the little mist that the river provided now and again . We met no one , but every turn in the road brought us past one more abandoned house , one more ruin of a shed or a byre ; eventually the road became one more desiccated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The desert had never been anything but what it was ; this waste was far wilder , far lonelier , because of the ghosts . Because of the ghosts that I could feel , even if I could n't see them - the people who had lived here , tried to live here , who had dug in and hung on as long as they could while the Earth itself turned ghost under their feet , under their splintery wooden ploughs and spades . I hated it as instinctively and deeply and sadly as I have ever hated a place on Earth , but the old man tramped on without ever looking back for me . And as I stumbled after him over the cold , wrinkled land , he talked constantly to himself , so that I could not help but overhear . " Near , near - they never move , once they .. . twice before , twice , and then that other time ... listen for it , smell it out , find it , find it , so close ... no mistake , it can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , reach for it , find it , find it , find it ! " he crouched lower and lower as we plodded on , until he might as well have taken the fox-form , so increasingly taut , elongated and pointed had his shadow become . To me during those two days crossing the Mihanachakali , he spoke not at all . Then , nearing sundown on the second day , he abruptly broke off the long mumbled conversation with himself . Between one stride and the next , he froze in place , one foot poised off the ground , exactly as I have seen a stalking fox do when the chosen kill suddenly raises its head and sniffs the air . " Here , " he said quietly , and it seemed not so much a word but a single breath that had chosen shape on its own , like a Goro 's dream . " Here , " he said again . " Here it was . I remembered . I knew . " We had halted in what appeared to me to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give or take ; a few shriveled hills lumping up that way ; no-color evening sky baking above ... I could never have imagined surroundings less suitable for a gallant last stand . It would n't have taken a Goro and two Hunters to pick us off as we stood there with the sunset at our backs : two small , weary figures , weaponless , exposed to attack on all sides , our only possible shelter a burned-out farmhouse , nothing but four walls , a caved-in roof , a crumbling chimney , and what looked to be a root cellar . A shepherd with a sling could have potted us like sparrows . " I knew , " he repeated , looking much more like his former superior self . " Not whether it would be here , but that it would be here . " It made no sense , and I told him so , and the yap-laugh sounded more elated than I had yet heard it . " Think for once , idiot ! No , no - do n't think , forget about thinking ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't learn at that bloody asylum of yours . Something your mother told you about such places - something the old people used to say , something children would whisper in their beds to frighten each other . Something even a fool just might already know - remember ! Remember ? " And I did . I remembered half-finished stories of houses that were not quite ... that were not there all the time ... rumors , quickly hushed by parents , of house-things blooming now and then from haunted soil , springing up like mushrooms in moonlight ... ! remembered an uncle 's absently mumbled account of a friend , journeying , who took advantage of what appeared to be a shepherd 's mountain hut and was not seen again no more than the hut itself - and someone else 's tale of bachelor cousins who settled into an empty cottage no one seemed to want , lived there comfortably enough for some years , and then ... I did remember . " Those are fables , " I said . " Legends , nothing more . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gutted hovel that was most likely greatly improved by a proper fire . Let it appear , let it vanish - either way , we are both going to die . Of course , I may once again have missed something . " He could not have been more delighted . " Excellent . I must tell you , I might have felt a trifle anxious if you had actually grasped my plan . " The pale yellow glow was rising in his eyes . " The true nature of that house is not important , and in any case would take too long to explain to an oaf . What matters is that if once our pursuers pass its door , they will not ever emerge again-therefore , we two must become bait and deadfall together , luring them on to disaster . " Everything obviously depended on our pursuers running us to this Earth at the same time ; if they fell upon each other in their lust to slaughter us , so much the better , but he was plainly not counting on this . " Once we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gestured toward the thing that looked so like a ruinous farmhouse , " why , then , our troubles are over , and no burying to plague us , either . " He kicked disdainfully at the stone-hard soil , and the laugh was far more fox than human . I said , as calmly and carefully as I could , " This is not going to work . There are too many unknowns , too many possibilities . What if they do not arrive together ? What if , instead of clashing , they cooperate to hunt us down ? Much too likely that we will be the ones trapped in your - your cornez - with no way out , helpless and doomed . This is absurd . " Oh , but he was furious then ! Totally enraged , how he stamped back and forth , glaring at me , even his mustache crouched to spring , every white hair abristle . If he had been in the fox-shape - well , who knows ? - perhaps he might indeed have leaped at my throat . " Ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are fit for nothing but my bidding . " He stamped a few more times , and then turned to stalk away toward the farmhouse ... toward the thing that looked like a farmhouse . When I made to follow , he waved me back without turning his head . " Stay ! " he ordered , as you command a dog . " Keep watch , call when they come in sight . You can do that much . " " And what then ? " I shouted after him , as angry as he by now . " Have you any further instructions for the help ? When I call to you , what then ? " Still walking , still not looking back , he answered , " Then you run , imbecile ! Toward the house - toward , but not into ! Do try to remember that . " On the last words , he vanished into the shadow of the farmhouse . And I ... why , I took up my ridiculous guard , stolidly patrolling the dead fields in the twilight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and exactly what I would do when it turned up . The wind was turning steadily colder , and I kept tripping on the ruts and tussocks I paced , even falling on my face once . I am almost certain that he could not have seen me . In an hour , or two hours , the half-Moon rose : the shape of a broken button , the color of a knife . I am grateful for it still ; without it , I would surely never have seen the pair of them flitting across the dark toward me from different directions , dodging my glance , constantly dropping flat themselves , taking advantage of every dimness , every little swell of ground . The sight of them froze me , froze the tongue in my mouth . I could no more have cried out warning than I could have flown up to that Moon by flapping my arms . They knew it , too . I could see their smiles slicing through the moonlight . I was not altogether without defenses . They had taught us somewhat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was confident that I could take passable care of myself in most situations . But not here , not in this situation , not for a minute , not against those two . My mind wanted to run away , and my body wanted to wet and befoul itself . Somehow I did neither , no more than I made a sound . The worst moment - my stomach remembers it exactly , if my mind blurs details - was when I suddenly realized that I had lost sight of them , Moon or no . Then panic took me entirely , and I turned and fled toward the farmhouse-thing , as instructed , my eyes clenched almost shut , fully expecting to be effortlessly overtaken at any moment , as a sheknath drags down its victim from behind . They would be laughing - were laughing already , I knew it , even if I could n't hear them . I could feel their laughter pulling me down . When the first hand clutched at my neck , I did turn to fight them . I like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I admit that without shame - but only once ; then I whirled in that grasp , as I had been taught , and struck out with right hand and left foot , in proper kuj'mai style , aiming at once to shatter a kidney and paralyze a breathing center . I connected with neither , but found myself dangling in the air , screaming defiance into a face like no face I knew . It had a lizard 's scales , almost purple in color , the round black eyes of some predatory bird - but glaring with a savage philosophy that never burdened the brain of any bird - a nose somewhere between a snout and a beak , and a long narrow muzzle fringed with a great many small , shy fangs . The Goro . " Where is he ! " it demanded in the Common Tongue . Its voice was higher than I had imagined , sounding as though it had scales on it as well , and it spoke with a peculiar near-lisp which would likely have been funny if I had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting in my throat . The Goro said again , almost whispering , " Where is he ? You have exactly three daks to tell me . " What measure of time a dak might be , I can not tell you to this day , but it still sounds short . What I can say is that all that kept me from betraying the old man on the instant was the fact that I could barely make a sound , once I had heard that voice and the hissing , murderous wisdom in that voice . I managed to croak out , " Sir , I do not know , honestly " - I did say sir , I am sure of that anyway - but the Goro only gripped me the tighter , until I felt my tongue and eyes and even my teeth about to explode from my head . It wanted the shapeshifter 's life , not mine ; but to the wrath in that clench , what difference . In another moment I would be just as dead as if it had been I who stole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made me weep , if I could have . Then the Hunters hit him ( or her , I never knew ) , one from either side . The Goro was so intent on strangling information out of me that it never sensed or saw them until they were upon it . It uttered a kind of soft , wheezing roar , hurled me away into a dry ditch , and turned on them , slashing out with claws at one , striking at the other 's throat , all fangs bared to the yellow gums . But they were quicker : they spun away like dancers , lashing back with their weaponless hands - and , amazingly , hurting the creature . Its own attacks drew blood from exposed flesh , but theirs brought grunts of surprised pain from deep in the Goro 's belly ; and after that first skirmish it halted abruptly , standing quite still to take their measure properly . Still struggling for each breath , I found myself absurdly sympathetic . It knew nothing of Hunters , after all , while I knew a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an opponent . They seemed no more eager to charge a second time than it was to come at them . One took a few cautious steps forward , pausing immediately when the Goro growled . The Hunter 's tone was blithe and merry , as I had always been told their voices were . " We have no dispute with you , friend , " and he pointed one deadly forefinger at me as I cowered behind the creature who had so nearly killed me a moment before . The Hunter said , " We seek him . " " Do you so ? " Those three slow words , in the Goro 's voice , would have made me reconsider the path to paradise . The reply was implicit before the Goro spoke again . " He is mine . I need what he knows . " " Ah , but so do we , you see . " The Hunter might have been lightly debating some dainty point of poetry or religion with a fine lady , such as drifted smokily now and then through the chill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need will come back to where it belongs . He will ... stay here . " " Ah , " said the Goro in turn , and the little sigh , coming from such a great creature , seemed oddly gentle , even wistful . The Goro said , " I also have no wish to kill you . You should go away now . " " We can not . " The other Hunter spoke for the first time , sounding almost apologetic . " There it is , unfortunately . " I had at that point climbed halfway out of the ditch , moving as cautiously and - I hoped - as inconspicuously as I possibly could , when the Goro turned and saw me . It uttered that same chilling wheeze , feinted a charge , which sent me diving back down to bang my head on stony mud , and then wheeled faster than anything that big should have been able to move , swinging its clawed tail to knock the nearer Hunter a good twenty feet away . he regained his feet swiftly enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head as the Goro came at him again . The second Hunter leaped on its back , chopping and jabbing at it with those hands that could break bones and lay open flesh , but the Goro paid no more heed than if the Hunter had been pelting it with flowers . It simply shook him off and struck his dazed partner so hard - this time with a paw - that I heard his neck snap from where I stood . It does not , by the way , sound like a dry twig , as some say . Not at all . I scrambled all the way out of the ditch on my second try , and poised low on the edge , ready to bolt this way or that , according to what the Goro did next . Vaguely I recalled that the old man had ordered me to run for the house once I had gained the attention of all parties ; but , what with the situation having altered , I thought that perhaps I might not move much for some while - possibly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortally bound to avenge his comrade , let out a howl of purest grief and fury and sprang wildly at the Goro - who , amazingly , backed away so fast that the Hunter literally fell short , and very nearly sprawled at the Goro 's feet , still crying vengeance . The Goro could have killed him simply by stepping on him , or with a quick slash of its tail , but it did no such thing . Rather , it backed farther , allowing him to rise without any hindrance , and the two of them faced each other under the half-Moon , the Hunter crouched and panting , the Goro studying him thoughtfully out of lidless black eyes . The Hunter said , his voice still lightly amused , " I am not afraid of you . We have killed - " he caught himself then , and for a single moment , a splinter of a moment , I saw real , rending pain in his own pitiless eyes " I have killed a score greater than you , and each time walked away unscathed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Perhaps not , " said the Goro , and nothing more than that . It continued to stand where it was , motionless as a long-legged gantiya waiting in the marshes for a minnow , while the Hunter , just as immobile , seemed to vibrate with bursting , famished energy . I began to ease away from the ditch , one slow-sliding foot at a time , freezing for what seemed hours between steps and wishing desperately now for the Moon to sink or cloud over . There came no sound or signal from the farmhouse-thing ; for all I knew , the old man had taken full advantage of the Goro 's distraction to abandon me to its mercy , and that of my own pursuer . Neither of them had yet paid any further heed to me , but each waited with a terrible patience for the other 's eyes to make the first move . At the last , the eyes are all you have . Gradually gaining an idiotic confidence in my chances of slipping off unnoticed , I forgot completely how I had earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until I did it again . I made no sound , for all my certainty that I had broken my nose , but they heard me . The Hunter gave a sudden short laugh , far more terrifying than the Goro 's strange , strangled roar , and came bounding at me , flying over those same furrows like a dolphin taking the sunset waves . I was paralyzed - I have no memory of reacting , until I found myself on my back , curled into a half-ball , as a shukri brought to bay will do , biting and clawing madly at an assailant too vast for the malodorous little beast even to conceive of . The Hunter was over me like nightfall : still perfectly efficient , for all his fury , contemptuously ignoring my flailing attempts at both attack and defense , while seeking the one place for the one blow he would ever need to strike . He found it . He found it perhaps half a second after I found the cook 's paring knife in the place where the old man had scornfully insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frantic , scrabbling thing at the end of my arm clutched the worn wooden handle and lunged blindly upward , slanting the blade along the Hunter 's rib cage , which turned it like a melting candle . I felt the warm , slow trickle - ah , they could bleed , then ! - but the Hunter 's face never changed ; if anything , he smiled with a kind of taunting triumph . Yes , I can bleed , but that will not help you . Nothing will help you . Nevertheless , he missed his strike , and I somehow rolled away , momentarily out of range and still , still alive . The Hunter 's hands were open , empty , hanging at his sides . The brown tunic was dark under his left arm , but he never stopped smiling . He said clearly , " There is no hope . No hope for you , no escape . You must know that . " " Yes , " I said . " Yes , I know . " And I did know , utterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead , then . " To do myself some justice , he moved in rather more deliberately this time , as though I might have given him something to consider . I caught a moment 's glimpse of the Goro standing off a little way , apparently waiting for us to destroy each other , as the old man had hoped it and the Hunters would do . The Hunter eased toward me , sideways-on , giving my paring knife the smallest target possible , which was certainly a compliment of a sort . I feinted a couple of times , left and right , as I had seen it done . He laughed , saying , " Good - very good . Really . " A curious way to hear one 's death sentence spoken . Suddenly I had had enough of being quarry : the one pursued , the one hunted down , dragged down , the one helplessly watching his derisive executioner approach , himself unable to stir hand or foot . Without anything resembling a strategy , let alone a hope , I flung myself at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside , but surprise slowed him just a trifle , and I hurtled into him , bringing us down together for a second time , and jarring the wind out of his laughter . For a moment I was actually on top , clutching at the Hunter 's throat with one hand , brandishing my little knife over him with the other . Then he smiled teasingly at me , like a father pretending to let a child pin him at wrestling , and he took the knife away from me and snapped it between his fingers . His face and clothes were splotched with blood now , but he seemed no whit weaker as he shrugged me aside and kneeled on my arms . He said kindly , " You gave us a better run than we expected . I will be quick . " Then he made a mistake . Under the chuckling benignity , contempt , always , for every living soul but Hunters . Under the gracious amusement , contempt , utter sneering contempt . They can not help it , it is what they are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken handle of the paring knife - with its one remaining jag of blade - lightly into my face , and raised a hand for the killing blow . When he did that , his body weight shifted - only the least bit , but his right knee shifted with it , and slipped in a smear of blood . My half-numb left arm pulled free . There was no stabbing possible with that fraction of a knife literally no point to it , as you might say . I thought only to mark him , to make him know that he had not killed a pitiful child , but a man grown . One last time I slashed feebly at his smiling face , but he turned his head slightly , and I missed my target completely , raking the side of his neck . I remember my disappointment - well , failed at that , too , my last act in this world . I remember . It was no dribble this time , no ooze , but a fierce leap like a living animal over my hand - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lover 's triumphant blurt of breath into my face . The Hunter 's eyes widened , and he started to say something , and he died in my arms . I might have lain there for a little while - I do n't know . It can not have been long , because the body was abruptly snatched off mine and flung back and away , like a snug blanket on a winter 's morning , when your mother wants you out feeding the jejebhais . The Goro hauled me to my feet . " Him , " it said , and nothing more . It made no menacing gesture , uttered no horrifying threat ; none of that was necessary . Now here is where the foolishness comes in . I had every hysterical intention of crying , " Lord , lord , please , do not slay me , and I will lead you straight to where he hides , only spare my wretched life . " I meant to , I find no disgrace in telling you this , especially since what I actually heard myself say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You will have to kill me , sir . " For that miserable , lying , insulting , shapeshif ting old man , I did that , and he jeered at me for it , later on . Ah , well , we begin as we are meant to continue , I suppose . The Goro regarded me out of those eyes that could neither blink ( though I saw a sort of pinkish membrane flick across them from time to time ) nor reveal the slightest feeling . It said , " That would serve no useful purpose . You will take me to him . " As I have said , it raised no deadly paw , showed no more teeth than the long muzzle normally showed . But I felt the command , and the implacable will behind the command - I felt the Goro in my mind and my belly , and to disobey was not possible . Not possible ... I can tell you nothing more . Except , perhaps , that I was young . Today , withered relic that I am become , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not possible then . " Yes , " I said . " Yes . " The Goro came up to me , moving with a curious shuffling grace , if one can say that , wrapping that tail around its haunches as daintily as a lace shawl . It gripped me between neck and shoulder and turned me . I said nothing further , but started slowly toward the farmhouse that was not a farmhouse - or perhaps it was ? what did I know of any thing 's reality anymore ? My ribs were so badly bruised that I could not draw a full breath , and there was something wrong with the arm that had killed the Hunter . The half-Moon was setting now , silvering the shadows and filling the hard ruts with shivering , deceiving light , and it was cold , and I was a child in a man 's body , wishing I were safe back in that place . Nearing the farmhouse , the Goro halted , tightening its clutch on my shoulder . Weary and bewildered as I was - no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied the house , looked at it for the first time , and could not imagine anyone ever having taken it for anybody 's home . The dark waiting beyond the sagging door sprang out to greet us with a stench far beyond stench : not the smell that anciently abandoned places have , of wood rotted into black slush , blankets moldering on the skeleton of a bed , but of an unhuman awareness having nothing to do with our notions of life or shelter , or even ordinary fear . The thing 's camouflage - how long in evolving ? how can it have begun to pass itself off as something belonging to this world ? - might serve well enough from a distance , on a dark night , but surely close to ... ? Then I glanced back at the Goro . The Goro had forgotten me completely , though its paw remembered . Its eyes continued to tell me nothing , but it was staring at the farmhousething with an intensity that would have been rapture in a human expression . It lisped , much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . I have run him to earth at last . " " No , " I said , once more to my own astonishment . " No . It is a trap . Believe me . " " I honor your loyalty , " the Goro said . It bent its awful head and made a curious gesture with its free paw which I have never seen again , and which may have meant blessing , or merely a compliment . I try not to think about it . It said , " But you can not know him as I do . he is here because what he stole from me is here . Because his honor demands that he face me to keep it , as mine demands that he pay the price of a stolen dream . We understand each other , we two . " " Nonsense , " I said . I felt oddly lightheaded , and even bold , in the midst of my leg-caving , bladder-squeezing terror . " He has no honor , and he cares nothing for your dream , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no house , but a horror from somewhere more alien to you than you are to me . Please - I am trying to save you , not him . Believe me , please . " The Goro looked at me . I have no more idea now than I did then of what it could have been thinking , nor of what it made of my warning . Did it take me seriously and begin silently altering its plans ? Had it assumed from the first that , as some sort of partner of its old enemy , nothing I said must ever be trusted for a moment ? all I know is what happened - which is that out of the side of my eye I saw the fox burst from the shadows that the farmhouse was real enough to cast in this world , under this Moon , and come racing straight toward the Goro and me . In the moonlight , he shone red as the Hunter 's blood . He halted halfway , cocking his head to one side and grinning to show the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it immediately : it was barely more than a pebble , less bright than the sharp teeth that gripped it , or the mocking yellow eyes above it . The Goro 's crystallized dream , the cause of the unending flight and pursuit that had called to me from a wagonload of manure . The fox tilted his head back , tossed the stone up at the sinking Moon , and caught it again . And the Goro went mad . Nothing I had seen of its raging power , even when it was battling the two Hunters , could possibly have prepared me for what I saw in the next moment . The eyes , the lidless eyes that I had thought could never express any emotion ... ! was in a midnight fire at sea once , off Cape Dylee , when the waves themselves seemed alight to the horizon , all leaping and dancing with an air of blazing delight at our doom . The Goro 's eyes were like that as it lunged forward , not shambling at all now , but charging like a rock-targ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound that it had not made before : if an avalanche had breath , if an entire forest were to fall at once , you might hear something something - like what I heard then . Not a roar , not a bellow , not a howl - no word in any language I know will suit that sound . Flesh never made that sound ; it came through the Goro out of the tortured Earth , and that is all there is to that . That is what I believe . The fox wheeled and raced away , his red brush joyously , insultingly high , and the Goro went after him . I stumbled forward , shouting , " No ! " but I might as well have been crying out to a forest or an avalanche . Distraught , battered , uncertain of anything at all , it may be that I was deceived , but it seemed to me that the shadow of the farmhouse-thing reared up as they neared it , spreading out to shapelessness and reaching ... I knew the fox well enough to anticipate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I miscalculated , and so did he . The shadow 's long , long arms cut off his escape on three sides , taking him in mid-leap , as a frog laps a fly out of the air . I thought I heard him utter a single small puppyish yelp , not like a fox at all . The Goro went straight in after him , never trying to elude the shadow 's grasp - I doubt it saw anything but the little dull pebble in the fox 's jaws . It vanished as instantly and completely as he had , without a sound . Telling you this tale , I notice that I am constantly pausing to marvel at my own stupidity . Each time I offer the same defense : I was young , I was inexperienced , I had been reared in a stranger place than any scoffer can possibly have known .. . all of it true , and none of it resembling an explanation for what I did next . Which was to plunge my naked hands into the devouring shadow , fumbling to rescue anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some poor creature consumed before we three ever came within its notice , within range of its desire . Today , I can only say that I pitied the Goro , and that the old man - the fox , as you will - was my guide , occasionally my mentor , and somehow nearly my friend , may the gods pity me . Have to do , wo n't it ? Where was I ? Yes , I remember - groping blindly in the shadow on the chance of dragging one or the other of them back into the moonlight of this world . My arms vanished to the wrists , the forearms , past the elbows , into ... into the flame of the stars ? Into the eternal , unimaginable cold of the gulfs between them ? I do not know to this day ; for that , you must study my scarred old flesh and form your own opinion . What I know is that my hands closed on something they could not feel , and in turn I hauled them back , though I could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human body , mine or anyone else 's . I screamed all the time , of course , but the pain had nothing to do with me - it was far too terrible , too grand , to belong to one person alone . I felt almost guilty keeping it for myself . The shadow fought me . Whatever I had seized between my burning , frozen hands - and I could not tell whether it was as small a thing as the fox or as great as the Goro - the shadow wanted it back , and very nearly took it from me . And why I did not , would not , allow that to happen , I can not put into words for you . I think it was the hands " decision , surely not my own . They were the ones who suffered , they were the ones entitled to choose - yes , no , hang on , let go ... I was standing far - oh , very far indeed - to one side , looking on . Did I pull what I held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or did the shadow finally give in , for its own reasons ? I know what I believe , but none of that matters . What does matter is that when my hands came back to me , they held the fox between them . A seemingly lifeless fox , certainly ; a fox without a breath or a heartbeat that I could detect ; a fox beyond bedraggled , looking half his normal size , with most of his fur gone , the rest lying limply , and his proud brush as naked as a rat 's tail . Indeed , the only indication that he still lived was the fact that he was unconsciously trying to shape-shift in my hands . The shiver of the air around him , the sudden slight smudging of his outline .. .1 jumped back , as I had not recoiled from the house-thing 's shadow , letting him fall to the ground . He landed without the least thump , so insubstantial he was . The transformation simply faded and failed ; though whether that means that the fox-shape was his natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too weak to assume , I have never known . The Moon was down , and with the approach of false dawn , the shadow was retreating , the housething itself withering absurdly , like an overripe vegetable , its sides slumping inward while its insides - or whatever they might have been seemed to ooze palely into the rising day , out to where the shadow had lain in wait for prey . Only for a moment ... then the whole creature collapsed and vanished before my eyes , and the one trace of its passage was a dusty hole in the ground . A small hole , the sort of hole that remains when you have pulled a plant up by its roots . Or think you have . There was no sign of the Goro . When I looked back at the fox , he was actually shaking himself and trying to get to his feet . It took him some while , for his legs kept splaying out from under him , and even when he managed to balance more or less firmly on all four of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor much else . Once the fox-shape was finally under control , he promptly abandoned it for that of the old man , who looked just as much of a disaster , if not even more so . The white mustache appeared to have been chewed nearly away , one burly white eyebrow was altogether gone , as were patches of the white mane , and the skin of his face and neck might have been through fire or frostbite . But he turned to stare toward the place where the house that was not a house had stood , and he grinned like a skull . " Exactly as I planned it , " he pronounced . " Rid of the lot of them , we are , for good and all , thanks to my foresight . I knew it was surely time for the beast to return to that spot , and I knew the Goro would care for nothing else , once it caught sight of me and that stone . " Amazingly , he patted my shoulder with a still-shaky hand . " And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I expected , truth be told . I may have misjudged you somewhat . " " As you misjudged the thing 's reach , " I said , and he had the grace to look discomfited . I said , " Before you thank me - " which he had shown no sign of doing " - you should know that I was simply trying to save whomever I could catch hold of . I would have been just as relieved to see the Goro standing where you are . " " Not for long , " he replied with that supremely superior air that I have never seen matched in all these years . " The Goro consider needing any sort of assistance - let alone having to be rescued - to be dishonorable in its very nature . He 'd have quickly removed a witness to his sin , likely enough . " I suspected that to be a lie - which it is , for the most part - but said nothing , only watching as he gradually recovered his swagger , if not his mustache . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newborn butterfly 's wings slowly plumping in the Sun . He said then - oddly quietly , I remember - " You are much better off with me . Whatever you think of me . " When he said that , just for that moment , he looked like no crafty shapeshifter but such a senile clown as one sees in the wayside puppet plays where the young wife always runs off with a soldier . He studied my hands and arms , which by now were hurting so much that in a way they did not hurt at all , if you can understand that . " I know something that will help those , " he said . " It will not help enough , but you will be glad of it . " Not yet true dawn , and I could feel how hot the day would be in that barren , utterly used-up land that is called the Mihanachakali . There was dust on my lips already , and sweat beginning to rise on my scalp . A few scrawny rukshi birds were beginning to circle high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to walk - inevitably back the way we had come , there being no other real road in any direction . The old man kept pace with me , pattering brightly at my side , cheerfully informing me , " The coast 's what we want - salt water always straightens the mind and clears the spirit . We 'll have to go back to Druchank - no help for that , alas - but three days farther down the Nai - " I halted then and stood facing him . " Listen to me , " I said . " Listen closely . I am bound as far from Goros and Hunters , from foxes that are not foxes and houses that are not houses as a young fool can get . I want nothing to do with the lot of you , or with anything that is like you . There must be a human life I am fit to lead , and I will find it out , wherever it hides from me . I will find my life . " " Rather like our recent companions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sounded like his old taunting self , but somehow subdued also . " Well , so . I will bid you good luck and good-bye in advance , then , for all that we do appear to be traveling the same road - " " We are not , " I said , loud enough to make my poor head ache , and my battered ribs cringe . I began walking again , and he followed . I said , " Whichever road you take , land or water , I will go some other way . If I have to climb back into a manure wagon a second time , I will be shut of you . " " I have indeed misjudged you , " he continued , as though I had never spoken . " There is promising stuff to you , and with time and tutelage you may blossom into adequacy yet . It will be interesting to observe . " " I will write you a letter , " I said through my teeth . There would plainly be no ridding myself of him until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word with him again . And I did not , not until the second night , when we had made early camp close enough to Druchank to smell its foulness on a dank little breeze . Hungry and weary , I weakened enough to ask him abruptly , " That house - whatever it was - you called it the beast . It was alive , then ? Some sort of animal ? " " Say vegetable , and you may hit nearer the mark , " he answered me . " They come and go , those things - never many , but always where they grew before , and always in the exact guise they wore the last time . I have seen one that you would take for a grand , shady keema tree without any question , and another that looks like a sweet little dance pavilion in the woods that no one seems to remember building . I can not say where they are from , nor what exactly becomes of their victims - only that it is a short blooming season , and if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . As that one did . " He yawned as the fox yawned , showing all his teeth , and added , " A pity , really . I have ... made use of that one before . " " And you led me there , " I said . " You told me nothing , and you led me there . " He shrugged cheerfully . " I tried to tell you - a little , anyway - but you did not care to hear . My fault ? " I did not answer him . A breeze had come up , carrying with it the smell of the Nai - somewhat fresher than that of the town - and the bray of a boat horn . " It had already taken the Goro , " I said finally , " and still it died . " " Ah ; well , a Goro 's not to everybody 's taste . " He yawned again , and suddenly barked with laughter . " Probably gave the poor old thing a bellyache - no wonder ! " He literally fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving his arms and legs in the air , purely delighted at the image , and more so with himself for creating it . I watched him from where I lay , feeling a curious mixture of ironic admiration , genuine revulsion , and something uncomfortably like affection , which shocked me when I made myself name it to myself . As it occasionally does even now . " I tried to stop the Goro , " I said . " I told him that it was a trick , that you were deceiving him . I begged him not to fall into your trap . " The old man did not seem even slightly perturbed . " Did n't listen , did he ? They never do . That 's the nature of a Goro . Just as not wanting to know things is the nature of humans . " " And your nature ? " I challenged him . " What is the nature of whatever you are ? " He considered this for some time , still lying on his back with his arms folded on his chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were wide open , and in the twilight they were more gray than fox-yellow just then . " Deceptive , " he offered at last . " That 's fair enough - deceptive . Misleading , too , and altogether unreliable . " But he seemed not quite satisfied with any of the words , and thought about it for a while longer . At last he said , " Illusory . Good as any , illusory . That will do . " I lay long awake that night , reflecting on all that I had passed through - and all that had passed through and over me - since I fled across another night from that place , with the Hunters behind me . Deceptive , misleading , illusory , even so he had done me no real ill , when you thought about it . Led me into peril , true , but preserved me from it more than once . And he had certainly taught me much that I needed to know , if I were to make my way forward to wherever I was making my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse counselors , and doubtless would yet , on my journey . My hands and arms pained me still , but far less than they had , as I leaned to nudge him out of his usual twitchy fox-sleep . He had searched out a couple of fat-leaved weeds that morning , pounded them for a good hour , mixed the resulting mash with what I tried not to suspect was his own urine , and spread it from my palms to my shoulders , where it crusted cool and stiff . I had barely touched his own shoulder before his eyes opened , yellow as they always are when he first wakes . I wonder what his dreams would look like , if they were to take daylight substance , as a Goro 's do . " Three more days on the Nai brings us where ? " I asked him . <p>
