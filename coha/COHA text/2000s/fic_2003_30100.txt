You want to do what , chere ? " Serena Sheridan took a deep breath and tried again . " I need to hire a guide to take me into the swamp . " Old Lawrence Gauthier laughed as if at the punch line of some grand joke . His voice rang out through the shop drowning out the Cajun music coming from the radio on the cluttered shelf behind him as well as the noises of the all-star professional wrestling emanating from the black and white television that sat on the counter . Lawrence sat on a stool behind the counter , his slender legs crossed at the knees , slouching in a posture reminiscent of an egret on a perchthin shoulders hunched , head low between them . Hls face was narrow with a prominent nose and eyes like jet beads . His skin was tanned dark and lined like old leather . His laughter ended in a fit of coughing . He reached for his cigarette makings and shook his head . " What for you wan na do dat , chere ? You goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , trying to shake his head and lick the edge of his cigarette paper at the same time . Serena smoothed her hands down the front of the immaculate oyster-colored linen blazer she wore over a matching pencil-slim skirt . She supposed she hardly looked dressed to walk into such a place , much less make the request she had . " No , I 'm not interested in fishing . " She looked around the store , hoping to spot someone else who might be able to help her . It was the middle of the day and Lawrence appeared to be the only person tending the dingy , dimly lit sporting goods store , though some banging noises were coming from behind him , from a room Serena knew to be an even dingier workshop where men fussed with theirboats , drank beer , swapped outrageous tales , and passed girlie magazines around . She knew because she had once snuck in there as a girl . A headstrong child , she had taken exception to being denied the chance to go in with her grandfather and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her vocabulary had gained a number of choice words that day that their housekeeper had later attempted to wash out of her mouth with soap . " I need to find my grandfather , Mr. Gauthier , " she said . " Apparently he 's gone out to his fish camp . I need someone to take me to him . " Lawrence looked at her , narrowing his eyes . Finally he shook a gnarled finger at her . " Hey , you dat Sheridan girl what left to be a doctor , no ? " " Yes . " " Yeah , yeah ! Mais yeah ! " He chuckled , tickled with his powers of recollection . " You lookin ' for Big Giff . " " Yes , but I need someone to take me . I need a guide . " He shook his head , still smiling at her as if she were a dear but infinitely dimwitted child . " Non , cherie , all what fishin ' guides we got ' round here is gone busy now till Monday . Lotta sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't nobody crazy ' nough go out to Giff 's . Go out there , get their head shot off , them ! " He sucked on his little cigarette , holding it between thumb and forefinger in an unconsciously European fashion . Half of it was gone before he exhaled . He reached out with his free hand and patted Serena 's cheek . " Ah , ma jolie fille , ai n't nobody crazy ' nough to go out to Big Giff 's . " As he said it , a loud bang sounded in the shop behind him , followed by a virulent French oath . Lawrence went still with his hand halfway to a tin ashtray on the counter , an unholy light coming into his eyes , a little smile tugging at a corner of his mouth . " Well , mebbe there 's somebody . Jes ' how bad you wan na go , chere ? " Serena swallowed the knot of apprehension in her throat , clasping her hands together in front of her like a schoolgirl . Now was not the time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go . " He bent his head a little to one side and gave a Gallic shrug , then shouted over his shoulder . " Etienne ! Viens ici ! " What Serena had braced herself for she was n't sure , but it certainly was n't the man who filled the doorway . The impact of his sudden presence had the same effect as being hit with the shock wave of an explosion , jolting her chest with a hollow thud and literally making her knees go weak a phenomenon she had heretofore not believed in . Her first impression was of raw power . Broad shoulders , bulging biceps . His chest , bare and gleaming with a sheen of sweat , was massive , wide , and thick , slabs of hard muscle beneath taut , tanned skin . The strong V of his torso narrowed to a slender waist , a stomach corrugated with muscle and dusted with black hair that disappeared beneath the low-riding waistband of faded green fatigue pants . Serena was certain she could live to be a hundred and never find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised her eyes to his face and felt a strange shiver pass over her from head to toe , making her scalp tighten and her fingers tingle . He stared at her from under sleepy lids with large , unblinking amber eyes , eyes like a panther 's . His brow was heavy and straight , his nose bold and slightly aquiline . His mouth did the most damage to her nervous system , however . It was wide , with lips so masterfully carved , so incredibly sensuous they would have looked perfect on a high-priced call girl . The effect of that mouth on a face so masculineall lean planes and hard angles and five-o'clock shadowwas blatantly sexual . He regarded her with a subtle disdain that suggested he did n't much care for women other than to bed them something he appeared to be capable of doing on a more than regular basis . Pulling a cigarette from behind his ear , he planted it in the corner of his mouth , lit it , and said something to Lawrence Gauthier in rapid Cajun French , a patois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly been eradicated by the Louisiana school system decades before . And although it was making a comeback of sorts due to the latest craze for all things Cajun , it was still not widely spoken . This man spoke it as if it were his primary language . Having grown up in Louisiana 's French Triangle , Serena had picked up the odd word and phrase , but he spoke too quickly for her to understand anything more than the implication . That was clear enough by Gauthier 's reaction another laughing and coughing fit and a slap on the shoulder for his barbarian friend . Serena felt her cheeks heat with embarrassment as the man sauntered to the end of the counter and leaned a hip against it , all the while assessing her blatantly with those lazy amber eyes . She could feel his gaze like a tangible caress , drifting insolently over her breasts , the curve of her waist , the flare of her hip , the long length of her legs . She had never imagined it possible to feel so naked while dressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cigarette , exhaled , and delivered another line to keep Gauthier in stitches . Serena gave him her coolest glare , defending herself with hauteur . " Excuse me , but I was raised to believe it is extremely rude to carry on conversations not all those around you can understand . One black brow sketched upward sardonically and the corner of that remarkable mouth curled ever so slightly . He looked like her idea of the devil on steroids . When he spoke to her his tone was a low , throaty purr that stroked her senses like velvet . " I told him you don ' look like you 're sellin ' it or givin ' it away , " he said , the words rolling out of his mouth with an accent as rich as Cajun gumbo . " So what could I possibly want with you ? I have no interest in americaine ladies . " He drawled the last word with stinging contempt . Serena tugged at the lapels of her blazer , straightening the uniform of her station . Her chin went up another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I can assure you I have no interest in you either . " He pushed himself away from the counter and moved toward her with the arrogant grace of a born athlete . Serena stubbornly stood her ground as he stepped near enough for her to feel the heat of his big body . Her heart fluttered in her throat as he stared down at her and raised a hand to smooth it back over her hair . " That 's not what your eyes are tellin ' me , chere catin . " Serena dragged in a ragged breath and held it , feeling as if she were going to explode from sheer fury . She slapped his hand away and took a step back from him . " I did n't come here to be insulted or manhandled . I came here to hire a guide , Mister " " Doucet , ' , he supplied . ' Etienne Doucet . Folks call me Lucky . " Serena vaguely remembered a Lucky Doucet from high school He 'd been several classes ahead of her , an athlete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The girls whose main interest in school had been guys had swooned at the mere mention of his name . Serena 's interests had lain elsewhere She looked at him now and thought whatever reputation he had sown back then he had certainly cultivated since . He looked like the incarnation of the word trouble . She had to be half mad to even consider hiring him . But then she thought of Gifford . She had to see him , had to do what she could to find out what had made him leave Chanson du Terre , had to do her best to try to convince him to come home . As tough as Gifford Sheridan liked to pretend he was , he was still a seventy-eight-year-old man with a heart condition . " I 'm Serena Sheridan , " she said in her most businesslike tone . Lucky Doucet blinked at her . A muscle tensed , the loosened in his jaw . " I know who you are , " he said , an oddly defensive note in his voice . Serena dismissed it as unimportant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Doucet . Gifford Sheridan is my grandfather . I need someone to take me out to his cabin . Mr. Gauthier has informed me that all the more reputable guides are booked up for the weekend , which apparently leaves you . Are you interested in the job or not ? " Lucky moved back to lean negligently against the counter again . Behind him , Lawrence had switched off his wrestling program in favor of live entertainment . In the background Iry LeJeune sang " La Jolie Blonde " in crackling French over the radio . The pretty blonde . How apropos . He took a deep pull on his cigarette , sucking the smoke into the very corners of his lungs , as if it might purge the feelings shaking loose and stirring inside him . When he had stepped from the back room and seen her he had felt as if he 'd taken a vicious blow to the solar plexus . Shelly . The shock had dredged up memories and emotions like mud and dead vines churning up from the bayou in the wake of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . The pain and hate were old companions . The fear was for the control he felt slipping , sliding through his grasp like a wet rope . The feelings assaulted him still , even though he told himself this was n't the woman from his past , but her sister , someone he had never had any contact with . Nor did he want to . They were twins , after all , maybe not perfectly identical , but cut from the same cloth . He stared at the woman before him , trying to set all personal feelings aside to concentrate on only the physical aspects of her . It should n't have been difficult to do ; she was beautiful . From the immaculate state of her honey-colored hair in its smooth French twist to the tips of her beige pumps , she radiated class . There was n't anything about her that should n't have been carved in alabaster and put in a museum . His gaze roamed over her face , an angel 's face , with its delicate bone structure and liquid dark eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside him . He swore , throwing his cigarette to the battered wood floor and grinding it out with the toe of his boot . Without looking , he reached behind the counter and pulled out a bottle of Jack Danielts , helping himself to a generous swig . Lawrence said nothing , but frowned and glanced away , tilting his head in silent reproof . Resenting the twinge of guilt pinching him somewhere in the vicinity of where his conscience had once resided , Lucky put the bottle back . Damn He damned Gifford Sheridan for having granddaughters that looked like heaven on earth . He damned women in general and himself in particular . If he had a lick of sense he would send Miss Serena packing . He would go about his own business and let the Sheridans do what they would . That was the kind of life he had chosen to live , solitary , and yet other lives kept drifting into his .
