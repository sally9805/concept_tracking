This Show Needs Help THE PHILANTHROPIST NBC , June 24 , 10 p.m . ET/PT 2 stars NEW SERIES ! DRAMA James Purefoy , a British actor best known here for playing Mark Antony in HBO 's Rome , has the sort of rumpled leading-man looks that make him both watchable and credible in just about any role : tycoon , playboy , adventurer , even spiritual pilgrim . He 's all those things in The Philanthropist . Teddy Rist , dripping with money and seemingly soaked with dissatisfied indifference , is secretly haunted by the death of his young son and the collapse of his marriage . But he finds a new purpose in life when he rescues a boy during a hurricane in Nigeria . Returning to the boy 's village to deliver medicine , Teddy nearly dies a thousand deaths himself : He has to get past drug agents , corrupt local officials , whistling bullets and poisonous snakes . The series will apparently follow Rist through similar adventures of soft-hearted derring-do , something between Oprah and Indiana Jones . It 's pretty well done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the pilot , has n't the show in a sense already finished ?

She carries on as if she 'd been halted by velvet ropes outside a debutante ball . Everyone is just doing what they think the cameras expect of them : It 's a rarefied form of peer pressure .
