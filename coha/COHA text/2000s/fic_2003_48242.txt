Since the last time we published one of Mark Tiedemann 's stories ( in the Sept. 2000 issue ) , Mark has published four novels : Metal of Night , Compass Reach , and two " Isaac Asimov 's Robot Mystery " novels . His next book , Peace and Memory , is due out in May and he says he is working on two more novels now . Fortunately , he has found some time to write short fiction again . His latest story ventures into the near future with a look at how workers " rights might evolve ... and how some people might be affected by the changes . <p> MS . HELLER ALWAYS CALLED me " Richard " when I did particularly well , which meant I walked home quickly and alone after classes , before the teasing and other scrap started . Todd , Keith , and Pete tried to catch up , but I ducked them through an overgrown yard behind an abandoned four-family . Todd was never a problem , but Keith and Pete came from old union families and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down Lennox to the next alley and came out on Sutter , which made it a long walk home , but better than listening to all the scrap about " bucking the line " and " management trainee . " An EMS van stood in front of our house . I could see the flashing lights from the end of the block and I started running . They had just gotten Dad onto the gurney when I opened the screen door . Mom looked at me and immediately reached out . Her face was pale and her eyes intense , but she held it together the way she always did in emergencies . " What ? " I started asking . " What is it ? What happened ? " " A stroke " Mom said , pulling me out of the techs " way as they wheeled Dad out the front door . Neighbors stood on their porches , watching . The doors of the van slid shut and the ambulance shot off up the street . The emergency room staff took Dad away before we arrived and tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at the admitting nurse and said she 'd wait till Dad 's rep got there . Howard , the shift supervisor from the plant , came through the doors first . I do n't know why I was relieved to see him , but it did n't matter just then . Any relief was good . He hugged Mom , whose hands began to tremble . " He was just lying on the floor by the refrigerator , " she said , " he would n't move , would n't answer me , but he had a pulse , I checked for that , and called - " " Take it easy , Ginny , " Howard said , his deep voice oddly quiet . " Go slow . You did all right . " She shook her head . " He just got home from the plant . You were there , did he act funny ? " " He complained of a headache , that 's about it . " Howard shrugged . " He was just in to run a diagnostic on his surrogate , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him to come back later , second shift . " Mom nodded absently . She was beginning to shake , little tremors that rippled her shoulders every minute or so . I 'd only seen her do that once before , when I was small and the union went out on a wildcat strike . I do n't remember much except late night calls and graffiti and arguments . Everyone was scared . It only lasted a couple of weeks , and by then Mom and Dad had lapsed into silence around each other . Howard kept talking , drawing Mom out till the union rep arrived . Then they went to the admittance desk and started haggling over insurance and doctors and what to do . Twenty minutes went by and Mom suddenly waved to me . An orderly took us to Dad 's room , where he lay in a white bed , tubes running into him . A doctor came in right after us and took Mom , Howard , and the rep aside , leaving me alone again . Dad was only forty-two . I stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those med monitors , and it scared me . I heard the doctor say he 'd had a major rupture in the left hemisphere . Any more delay getting him to the clinic and he 'd have been dead . I was sixteen and my dad was suddenly an invalid . A lot of stuff goes through your head - not thoughts , nothing that mass , just stuff , like neutrinos raining past - a lot of it really self-centered . What would this do to my schooling ? What would this do to my list of chores ? What would this do to my vacations ? What would this do to - fill in the blank . Along with this , though , parallel to it is this enormous wrestling match with reality . That 's Dad in there , gone , half his brain scrapped , personality probably scrambled . But he 'll get better , medical science is wonderful , in fact the doctors have exaggerated the problem , he 's really just suffering from a mass headache and as soon as they finished IVing acetaminophen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temples , and crack a bad joke . That 's Dad in there , mostly dead , and you ca n't let go . Mom ca n't handle everything by herself and you 're just sixteen , you ca n't handle anything and what will you do when Mom needs to shift the load - and back and forth like that . There are no priorities ; this is a new world and you just do n't have a map and there 's no good way to describe this mix of stressed love , fear , concern , self-pity , and terror . No standards . So I just stood there , expressionless from what Mom told me later , and watched the machines try to save Dad 's life and do what they could to repair the damage , and looking solid mass way beyond my years . A lot of heroism is just popular misinterpretation after the event . And added to all this spin , I had school the next day . We stayed at the hospital for the next several hours . A few of Dad 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friend Todd 's father . They had their own troubles - surrogate problems that had been stuck in committee for weeks-but he showed up . My dad and Cliff had been buddies since school , saw the last of the labor draft before the new reforms came in , managed all their lives to stick together . I do n't even know if my dad knew Cliff was there . Late that night , Howard took me home while Mom stayed at the hospital . I was surprised when I got a three-day absence approved . Usually nothing short of death is acceptable , but maybe the union rep talked to them . They sent me home with a syllabus so I would n't fall behind . Todd and Keith told me to link up if I needed help with anything - which was their way of saying that they needed help - and I told them I 'd let them know how things went . On the third day a truck rolled up to the house and a team came in to install a home monitor unit for Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were added attachments . I asked some questions , but the workers ignored me . Mom came home before they left , so I did n't have to worry about signing anything and having it declared invalid later because of my age . She insisted they take her through the machinery . They were put out , but Mom can be very insistent , so in a tired-but-superior voice the crew foreman explained it all . " Blood pressure , EKG , EEG , choline-dopamine balance , platelet , white and red corpuscle count , blood sugars , renal , protein absorption , metabolic - " He tapped the gauges and the controls in turn . Mom nodded at each one and he went faster with each nod . She kept up , asked a couple of questions , then pointed to one section he had n't mentioned . " Uh , that 's the augment download , " he said . " There 's a diagnostic for you to run through with that one . I 'm not really sure how it works . " " Let 's go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't look happy . I leaned against the door to the spare bedroom , where all this machinery had been set up , and listened intently . Pretty soon I realized that Mom had squeezed a DNA out of the insurance company . A direct neural augment . The moment I understood that , I blanked on the rest of the tutorial . When the crew left , I stopped Mom in the hall . " They 're wiring Dad up ? " " Do n't start . You know as well as I do that he 'd go crazy if he could n't function . " " Sure , but - " " It does n't have to be general knowledge . You want me to go over the whys and wherefores ? " " No , no , you 're taking me wrong . I think it 's great . It 's just - well , how 's the local going to take it ? " She gave me a funny look , then shook her head . " I already went over it with the union rep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it there 's no problem . It 's a medical augment , just like a prosthetic limb . " She patted my arm . " Are you caught up ? You have to go back to class tomorrow . " I nodded . " When 's Dad coming home ? " " Tomorrow night . The augment 's being installed today . I have to get back to the hospital , but I wanted to be here for this . " She looked a little afraid just then . " It 's going to be fine . " TODD AND KEITH waited outside school the first morning I returned . " Hey , " Todd said . " How 's your dad ? I heard what happened . " " They 're bringing him home today , " I said . " I do n't know . He had a hemorrhage . " " Is he gon na be all right ? " Todd asked . Keith gave him a look . " Sure he is , he just has to learn to function on half a brain . " Todd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Keith frowned . " I did n't - sorry . " " Did you keep up ? " Todd asked . I held up my laptop . " Somehow . " " Good . Olan 's going through standings this morning , " Todd said . " You know where Local 255 ranked this quarter ? " I looked at him and shrugged . " Fifth in the city . " " Anything in the top twenty-five is mass , " Keith said . " Solid mass , " Todd agreed . " We 're kicking butt . " " Did he post individual rankings ? " I asked . " No , " Keith said , cocking an eyebrow , " but I heard you did number two in overall . Have to start calling you Sir , Mr. Management . " I felt my ears warm . " Do n't even start . " Keith laughed . " What , you 're thinking maybe Harvard ? Berkeley ? Cornell ? " " Hey , " Todd said . " Hey what ? I 'm just spinning him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pushing past . " Hey , I did n't mean anything - " I went into the polytech . I was in no mood for that massless scrap . I turned in my work at each class , thanking each instructor for their concern and for the time off . Ms. Heller asked if I had a few minutes after classes . I had to postpone since Dad was supposed to come home that night , and she said fine , later would be all right . Then she handed out an essay assignment which made several people groan . " I want an essay on the 29th Amendment which designated labor as a property and the Jarelman Court 's decision abolishing the labor draft . " I thought , again ? It seemed like every year somebody wanted us to do something on that subject . I think I had a gigabyte of material stored in my home computer , everything I 'd ever learned about it since second grade . But it was a union school and it was traditional to bitch , but none of us would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that topic . " There goes the weekend , " Todd muttered in the hall after . " Hey , you want to work this together ? " I shook my head . " Got ta be home . Dad 's going to need me and I do n't think Mom would be too happy about company just yet . " " Maybe online ? " I looked at Todd . He did really mass in the technical subjects , but his weakness was in history and politics . It was funny - he understood the wildest stuff about electrical engineering and data compilers and robotics , but when it came to court actions and legislative procedures he was massless . " Maybe , " I said . " Might not be a bad idea . " He brightened then . Keith waited outside . Todd broke off , waving at me , and went to join him and Pete . I watched them go off together , heading for the handball courts , and wished I could join them . Dad sat up in the bed in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his head , down below the level of the mattress , and then disappeared into the tangle of wiring in the base of the monitors . He wore a light robe that fell open over his broad , hair-covered chest . He had n't shaved in a couple of days and he grinned lopsidedly at me , teeth bright against gray-black stubble . Mom sat in a chair beside him , holding his right hand . She smiled at me nervously . " S-ss-thon ... , " he said . He shook his head . " It get better .... " " Hi , Dad . " Dad winked - sort of , since both eyelids fluttered down , then the right one stayed down while the other jerked upward . He patted Mom 's hand lightly . " How do you feel ? " I asked . " Half-athed - assed - shit , I 'll get this right . " His left hand sort of waved at the monitors . " Whaddya think ? " " Mass . " " And a lot of it . My new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-critically . Dad laughed . " Well ? It ith - is ... hm . " " Are you guys hungry ? I can cook tonight . " " No " me , " Dad said . " But make your mother eat . " " I 'm not really - " " Ginny .... " Mom nodded , then looked up at me and smiled . Things were settling down for her , I guess , because she had that look right before she just lets everything slide . " Spaghetti , " I said . " You eat some , too , Dad . " " Right . I can handle spaghetti like this . " Mom had to feed him , but he ate a lot , which made both of us feel better . Mom went over the various service requirements of the set-up - for the time being he had a dedicated waste disposal unit that needed new cartridges every four or five days or the house would start smelling-and gave me a pager slaved to the monitor . In case she was out and Dad needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal me . I wondered how they 'd feel about that at school , but I did n't say anything . " Thon - son - shit - Rich - " " Yeah , Dad ? " Mom was in the bathroom . " Need a favor . Call Howard at the plant . Want you to go check Difty . Did n't finish the diagnoth-tic . " " Howard said you did . " He frowned at that and seemed to look around , as if trying to locate something . He shook his head . " Do n't remember . I feel better if-would you talk to Howard and see if he 'll let you run it again ? " " Ca n't one of the other guys do that for you ? " He shook his head . " I 'd rather they di' n't . Pleath - please . " I shrugged and said sure , then Mom came back and told me to do my homework . All in all it did n't look too bad ; in about three weeks he was supposed to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our duties would slack off . Two months , the doctors and engineers said , and he 'd be practically normal , except for his sleep cycle . The DNA was " on " all the time , no way internally to shut it off , so Dad had to plug himself into the monitor to sleep . A timer rebooted him after a certain period , but we found out pretty quickly that sleep came almost instantly . Dad was on the switch as much as the augment . Eventually , when the medical monitors could be removed , a smaller augment box could be installed in the master bedroom and they could sleep together again , but now-and for the first time in their marriage , so Mom told me-separate beds . Separate bedrooms . Still , it did n't look bad . HOWARD DID N'T like it , but he agreed to let me do the diagnostic on Difty . He let me onto the floor Saturday morning . " Shop steward does n't come in on the weekend , so there should n't be any problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me over to Difty 's station and looked around for monitors . He nodded and told me he 'd be back in ten . Difty continued making spot welds on the line of conduit that conveyor-belted past while I ran the diagnostic . The surrogate was old , the cover plates discolored , a few bent out of shape . It was large and cumbersome and unlovely , especially when compared to some of the newer , sleeker models that were almost sensual in the smoothness of their parts . Dad had talked occasionally about buying a new one , but it just never seemed the right time . Difty did its job well and that was good enough . The small screen flickered unevenly as the data scrolled up . When Difty finished this shift it had to go to the parks and recreation motor pool to draw its assignment for landscaping duty . The instructions were already spooled in its standby memory . Meanwhile there was part of an engineering problem crunching in its analytics . That surprised me ; I did n't think Difty handled brainshare jobs anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that section , so I keyed for more data . PROGRAM ERROR , KEY F1 , RECONFIGURE Great . Maybe Difty should n't be handling brainshare . If it lost the program before completion the contractor could deduct a penalty . I pressed F1 . The screen went blank . I stared at it for several seconds . Then the spotwelder sputtered to silence and Difty 's arms stopped . The assembly line halted . " Oh , shit . " I stabbed the reboot and waited anxiously for some response . " What the hell is going on ? " Howard was coming toward me down the catwalk . " I do n't know , " I said , waving at the screen . " I was running Difty 's diagnostics and suddenly - crash ! " He glanced at the screen , then tapped in a series of commands . Still nothing . Up and down the line other surrogates stood at attention , their manipulators ready and waiting . " Damnit , " Howard spat . " Looks like - wait . " The control icon winked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Difty 's reboot . The screen came on with a program query : INSTRUCTIONS ? " Great , " Howard said . " You cleared her memory . " " Oh , no .... " He turned away and worked at the station monitor keyboard for a moment . " No problem , simple install . There . " The screen flickered with the instructions , then Difty restarted . The line moved again . " What happened ? " " I do n't know . I found a brainshare program running and it flagged a problem . When I tried to reconfigure , she crashed . " " I 'd get on the line to that contractor and find out what was in that program . Who is it ? " " CDR Limited . " He pulled his memopad and made a note , then tapped for data . After a few seconds , he nodded . " I 've got notes here of other problems with CDR brainshare routines . You 're not the only one to have had trouble . You want me to file a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to call parks and recreation now , " I said . " I think their routine was crashed as well . " " How many leases have you got her running ? " " Just three . " Howard pursed his lips . " Maybe Sam ought a consider getting a new surrogate . Or getting this one overhauled at least . I 'll get this in the circuit for you . " WHEN I GOT HOME I found two union reps in the living room with Mom . " Richard , " she said , " would you mind looking in on your father ? And I took some chicken out of the freezer for tonight . Maybe you could get it started ? " " Sure . " I nodded to the visitors , who watched me cross the living room and leave . I heard talk start as soon as I was out of their sight , which annoyed me . But Mom only calls me Richard when she 's worrying over something , so I did n't make an issue of it . I knocked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dad 's Door " - and entered . " Hey , " I said . He grinned at me . " Hey . " He nodded in the direction of the living room . " They thtill out there ? " " Yeah . Who are they ? " " Ca n't you tell ? Inveth - investigators . " " Why ? " He tapped his skull . " My new mind . Questions of status . " " How 'd they know ? " " Insurance . " " Oh . " " Do n't worry about it . Formality . They 're worried if I might use this thing to make money . I told your mother , hey , I do n't have time for that . We got vacation plans this year , all I want is to be back on my feet . " I nodded . I did n't know what to say . I believed him , sure , it would be stupid to violate union rules and risk his brotherhood , but I 'd heard stories - everyone hears stories - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't matter what everybody intends , it just works out that way . But he was right , we had vacation plans and the doctors said two months before he could reasonably navigate with this new stuff , so what was there to worry about ? I had two more quarters before performance reports to sweat for third stage entry . If I passed those high enough I could opt out of the union schools if I wanted and get admission to a college outside the brotherhood status . Then - " I got ta get supper ready , Dad . You need anything ? " " No . Thanks , Rich . " As I opened the door he said , " Everything 's gon na be fine . You know that , do n't you ? " " Sure . Solid mass . " Pete , Jack , Toby , Larry , and Kyle met me out in front of school the next morning . They blocked my way . Pete and Kyle were both bigger than me . " We heard your dad 's gone management , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stroke . " " Sure , but he 's been wired up . He 's a chiphead . " " So he can walk and eat without help . What 's the problem ? " " Chiphead . " I pushed through them , my heart pounding . None of them followed and by the time I got to homeroom I started feeling stupid for being afraid . Todd and Keith usually sat next me , one on either side , but today they sat three rows back . Todd waved at me , looking apologetic , but Keith would n't even acknowledge my presence . Pete and the others came in together and sat in the back row where they usually sat , but I could feel them staring at me . I fixed my attention forward and told myself it would pass . They 'd get over it . All I had to do was be patient . After orientation I applied for an appointment with my counselor . By fourth period he verified it for study hall that day . I was relieved but surprised . Usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my study hall , last period for the day for me . I excused myself and hurried down to the front offices . Mr. Jay was out for a few minutes , so I sat outside his door and waited . " Rich ? " I looked up and saw Ms. Heller standing in the hallway , looking at me . I nodded and said hello and she came closer . " Is everything all right ? " she asked . " Sure . I 'm waiting for Mr. Jay . " Her expression shifted through degrees of uncertainty and finally settled on concern . " If you need any help , talk to me , okay ? " " Sure . " I watched her walk away . " Hey , Rich , " Mr. Jay said , coming from the other end of the hallway . " Sorry . Paperwork . Come on in . " I sat down in his little office . " So , " he said , " what can I do for you ? " " I 'm not sure . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I mean , if there are any options . And - " I did n't intend to say this just then , but it came out anyway . " And what are my options for third stage if I have to leave school now . " He looked startled and laughed . " Whoa , what do you mean , have to leave ? " He started typing on his keyboard . " Last time we talked there were n't any problems - " " No , last time we talked there were n't . " He nodded , half-listening , and studied his screen . " No , your scores are still upper twenty . No ranking problems there . " " That 's not the trouble . I mean - " He pushed a button and his door slid shut . " Okay , we 're private . Tell me what 's wrong . " I told him about Dad 's stroke and his new wiring . Mr. Jay listened expressionlessly . I did n't know how much he wanted to hear , so I added what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thing affecting my schooling . He frowned briefly , but nodded . " I do n't really see a problem , Rich , " he said finally . " What you 're telling me is that your father has had a prosthesis implanted . That does n't constitute a violation of union rules . " " Unless he uses it for work . " He shrugged . " What does that mean ? He has to supervise his surrogate and to do that he uses his brain . I mean , he has to think about it , right ? Is that a violation of union rules ? " " No , but that 's not what I mean . " " You mean if he starts taking on brainshare work . Well , he understands the restrictions , right ? " " Well , sure . He 's been IAMS for - god , forever . " " So what 's the problem ? Beyond a couple of bullies who think they can harass you , life goes on . This wo n't change anything . " I wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face , because Mr. Jay waved his hand in the air the way he does when he wants to cut to the bottom line . " This is a change in your home structure . Some morons are going to be threatened by the possible abuse , but that passes . These kids are your friends , right ? They wo n't shut you out forever . And so what if they do ? If they were really your friends they would n't act like that . You can always transfer to another local if it gets bad , but at this stage I 'd recommend you stick to your course selections and your instructors and to hell with the rest of the world . " I was a little shocked to hear him talk this way , but it made sense and I felt better . He talked to me like an adult . My doubts were n't gone , but they seemed a lot less important . Howard was there when I got home that night . He sat beside Dad . Mom was there , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them for a time until Dad said hello , then Howard nodded , and Mom excused herself to get dinner started . " What 's wrong ? " I asked , and because of the way Mr. Jay had treated me I felt that I deserved to get the same from them . " Oh , just detail crap , " Dad said . " No big thing . " Howard raised his eyebrows at him , but did n't add anything . " Are you staying for dinner , Howard ? " I asked . " No , Rich , I got ta get home . I just came by to give your father some updates . " He stood , gave Dad another look , then said good night to everyone . Mom did n't say anything through dinner , just stared into her plate . Later I heard her and Dad fighting again . I buried myself in overtime and did my best to ignore them . THE SAME BUNCH met me outside school in the morning , but they did n't say anything , just watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in marker - MANAGEMENT ! - and the rest of the day no one but instructors talked to me . I caught Todd looking very guilty a couple of times , but all he 'd do was wave at me when he thought no one else noticed . The rest of the week went on this way . By Friday I believed Mr. Jay had n't known what he was talking about . Nothing was passing . It was n't getting any worse , but this was bad enough . Fine , I thought , if you massless morons are going to be this scab , hell with you . It gives me more time to get through second stage and out of here . It felt like a plan and I went home relieved . The picture window had been smashed . A pair of surrogates were putting up a new one . A third was scrubbing black graffiti off our walk . Mom was n't there . Dad 's door was open a crack , but all I did was knock and tell him I was home . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew and I did n't feel like listening to any more massless reassurance , especially not from Dad . In my room I accessed the web and started looking for recruiters " sites . But I realized pretty quickly that I could n't tell the legitimate ones from the traps . The last thing I needed was to bring more trouble on by admitting on the web that I wanted to leave the union school . There 's always someone who does n't want to stay with the union . You hear stories about them ; once in a while they appear on the web . It 's massless . At least , I 'd always thought so . I wondered then when it had changed . Dad 's stroke triggered a lot , but I knew better than to accept that as the sole cause . How long had I been thinking this way ? Mom came home then . She looked in and said hi , then went to the kitchen . I did n't pay attention for a time until I heard shouting . She and Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to find Todd on the web . I found him in a chat room , but he would n't respond . He dropped out and I tried to follow , but it looked like he had just left the web completely . Ten minutes later my phone chirped . " Hey , Rich . " " Todd . " " Sorry for ignoring you . " " Yeah , well . " " Look , right now - " " Right now some scab is saying my father has gone management and you , you massless idiot , you believe it . " " No , I do n't ! " " Then - " " What do you want me to do ? Scab Keith and Pete and Kyle ? " " You 're scabbing me . " " Rich ! " " It 's okay . Loyalty 's cheaper in bunches , I understand . I just thought it 'd be solid mass for someone to stand up for me . " He was quiet for a time . Then : " What are you going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Rich - it wo n't . " I wanted to argue with him , but it sounded right . I really did n't think it would pass , either . " What 'd I do ? " I asked . " It 's my dad , not me . Ca n't you morons cope with that . " " Do n't you think it 's the same with us ? " " What ? What do you mean ? " " Look , I have to go . What are you going to do ? " " Try to find another school , I guess . I wo n't tolerate this shit . " " You know how hard that 'd be ? " " What do you suggest ? " " I do n't know . File a grievance maybe . " " Against my parents ? " " It could get you into a different union , take the pressure off . " " Shit , they 're my parents , Todd ! They are n't the ones scabbing me ! " " But - " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . Sorry . " After he broke off , I sat there more confused than ever . Dad always said it was worthless to try to negotiate from adrenaline , that the minute your emotions started dictating the conversation it was all over . I guess he was right . I had n't said one thing I 'd wanted to say . I could still hear my parents arguing , a muffled rumble off in the distance . I left early the next morning . Todd was coming out of his house when I got there . He saw me and froze on the steps . Then he glanced back at his front doot and hurried toward me . " I 'm supposed to meet Keith in a few minutes , " he said . " Is that a request for me to leave ? " He blushed and looked at his feet . " Rich - " " We 've been friends a long time . " " Yeah , well . " " You said something last night . You said it was the same for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked back toward his house nervously , then nodded for us to walk . At the end of the block he said , " Our parents . They do n't want us around you . " " What ? Why ? " " Because of your dad . " " But - Cliff and Sam have been friends all their lives . You 're telling me - " " Come on , Rich , do n't be the same massless idiot you think the rest of us are ! " I rounded on him , put my hand against his chest . " You 're telling me you 're all listening to your parents ? Half the time you make it a joke not to . Now - when it comes to something important - you do ? " " What do you want ? Yeah , when it comes to something important we do . So do you . The trouble is what you think is important is n't the same as what they think is . " " Friendship - " He stepped back . " Do n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I ca n't be your friend ! Not now , not anymore ! " " Why not ? " Then : " Is your dad beating you again ? " Todd looked about to cry . He shook his head and sniffed loudly . " We just ca n't ! It costs too much ! Now leave me alone ! " He pushed past me . As I turned I saw Keith and Pete standing a few meters away , hands on hips , glaring at me . Todd went by them and said something , but neither Keith or Pete moved . " Why do n't you leave him alone ? " Keith asked . " Why do n't you stay out of other peoples " business ? " " Hey , scab , I do n't need to listen to your massless waste . " " Then do n't . " Todd stopped . " Keith , come on . Let 's get to school . " Keith pointed a finger at me . " Stay away from Todd . You upset him . " " I upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keith stepped toward me . Todd hurried up behind him and grabbed his arm . " Do n't , " he said . Keith looked at him . " Make up your mind . Whose side are you on ? " " Whose side do you think I 'm on ? " I shouted . " My dad had a stroke ! He would 've been bedridden , hooked up to a machine for the rest of his life ! " " And now he 's management ! " Keith snapped back . " He made a choice ! My dad said if he had any loyalty in him at all he 'd have opted for the machine . " " Your dad 's got room to talk ! He did n't have a stroke ! He 's not an invalid ! " " Loyalty 's not always convenient ! " " No , I guess it is n't . But the way you 're acting you sure wish it were . " Keith broke free of Todd 's grip and swung on me . I ducked it and backpedaled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete got hold of his arms . " Get away from us ! " Keith screamed . " I got one more question . " Pete looked at me . " Ca n't you hear , scab ? " " I can hear . You ca n't . Even if what your parents are saying is true about my dad , what does that have to do with me ? You 're scabbing me ! " " Disloyalty runs in families ! " Keith said . " Like father , like son ! Blood tells ! You ca n't choose your family ! " Tears were running down his face now and saliva sprayed with each phrase . Everyone was crying except Pete , but he looked like it would n't take much to get him started . I wanted to run . Hard as it was , I made myself walk away . Mom did n't eat in the morning . She sat staring at me , her forehead creased . " Mom - " " Difty broke down , " she said . " What ? " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know that . Howard said it was the company 's fault . " She shook her head . " They 're fighting it . Meantime , there 's something wrong with Difty we ca n't fix until the grievance is settled . " " But - " She stood . " I have to go . Make sure your father eats something , will you ? " I tried to get more out of her , but she hustled around the house gathering her things and hurried out the door . It sounded like the same massless crap Todd 's family was stuck in . I went to Dad 's door and knocked on it , half hoping he was asleep and would n't hear . But he called to come in . He looked a lot better . His color was nearly back to normal and his hair was starting to grow in over the surgery . He grinned at me and waved at a chair . " Sit , sit , " he said . His speech came out sharp and precise . " I guess it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hardware ? Yeah , it is . I feel pretty good . Might be this was the best thing that ever happened to me . " " I heard Difty crashed . " Dad shrugged . " That brainshare messed up more than we thought . I tried to install a new brainshare and the whole system just broke down . Howard 's fighting with the local over maintenance . They wo n't allow the new claim until the previous one 's been settled , and CDR is fighting the claim . " " Why ? I mean , if they 've been having trouble all along like Howard said - " " That 's exactly why . If they do n't fight it they stand to lose a lot . They have to win or risk bankruptcy . At least that 's what Howard 's been telling me . " " But - the local should know that . Why would they leave you without a surrogate because some corporate is jamming the process ? " Dad shook his head but he would n't look at me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school , " I said , standing . Dad looked up at me , surprised . " Oh . Yeah . Well , come talk to me some more when you get home . I 'm not a scrambled mess anymore , I can manage . " He laughed . " No , you 're mass . Solid mass . " " One of these days you 're going to have to explain to me just what that means . " I left as quickly as I could . Todd did n't show up for classes the next day . Or the day after . Keith and Pete and the others would n't even look at me , so I did n't bother to ask them anything . By the third day I started getting worried . I asked Mr. Olan if Todd had called in sick . " You did n't hear ? " he asked . " Hear what ? No , I - " " Todd wo n't be coming back here . He filed a grievance against his parents . He 's being sequestered in committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Olan looked uncomfortable . For a moment I thought he 'd drop it . He 'd answered my question . But he lowered his voice and added , " I heard his father beat him up pretty badly . It 's my understanding the man has a history of violent temper . They must have had an argument . " " Is he all right ? " " I do n't know , Rich . That 's all I heard . He must be , if he filed . At least physically . " I let the cut pass and thanked him . By the end of the day I 'd convinced myself that it was my fault . The argument must have been over me , Dad , this crazy situation . If I had n't pushed Todd , made him feel guilty about what he and the others were doing-but even as I took all this blame onto myself I knew it was massless . It did n't seem like Todd to do something this drastic over one incident . Maybe it had been building for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stopped the abuse . Howard was at our house again . He and Dad sat at the kitchen table talking . They both stopped when I walked in and looked at me . " Sorry to interrupt , " I said . " No , hey , Rich ! " Dad called . " I got ta get , Sam , " Howard said , standing . Dad blinked at him as if caught by a practical joke . Howard smiled at me briefly . I nodded back and went to my room to drop off my backpack . When I came out , Dad was just closing the front door . I watched him shuffle back to the kitchen . He looked distracted . Then , as he walked by me , completely oblivious to my presence , I saw the chip in his interface jack . " You 're doing brainshare , " I said . He looked up startled . " Uh .... " " Howard set this up , did n't he ? " " Rich , listen . I - " " He crashed Difty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time but afterward . " Dad shook his head and walked away . I went back to my room . I hate it when people tell you they do n't know how they feel . How can they not know ? But I sat there in the dimming light and could n't understand what I felt . Maybe because I felt everything - anger , resentment , frustration , pity , fear , betrayal , despair-and there was n't room for them all , so they turned over , queuing up to have a second here , a minute there , never giving me a chance to settle on one and really feel it . I stared out the window at the neighbor 's wall as the Sun went down and just spun along with it all . I decided I did n't have any right to judge Dad . None of my choices seemed worth the cost , what made me think his were any better ? Because I 'm the child , he 's the adult . Whatever that has to do with anything . Dad sat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows . I could only see half his face . I wanted to apologize , give him something to make up for the hurt I might have caused . I wanted to tell him it was all right , that he was solid mass by me , and it did n't matter what he had to do to make the bills , he was my father and that mattered more than the rest . But before I could say a single word he said , " Your mother left . " I understood so fast that I did n't have time to pretend not to . " Why ? " " Hm ? Oh . Nobody stopped talking to her if that 's what you mean . She was n't in trouble at work , nothing like that . She- " He swallowed loudly and I knew he was fighting to keep calm . It did n't work , his voice shook a little , his eyes glittered . " She just could n't accept this . Her family-they - well , they 're real traditional . " After a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left him alone . I WOKE TO SHOUTING . It came through the door muffled and faint , but I was n't sleeping soundly anyway . I lay there for a couple of minutes trying to ignore it , but it persisted , so I climbed out of bed and pulled on my pants and a T-shirt . The front door stood open . The voices grew louder as I came up to it , until I could make out Dad 's voice . A flashing red and white light pulsed against the screen door . I stepped onto the porch . Two police cruisers blocked the street in front of our house , both with their lights going . Neighbors stood across the street in a huddle . On our lawn Dad stood face to face with three cops and two other men dressed in dark clothes . One of the cops held a baseball bat at his side and I recognized it as my old little league slugger. " - fuckers spray painting my house , damnit ! " I heard Dad say . One of the cops spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bullshit ! I been putting up with this now for weeks and I 've had about enough ! They come around here again I 'm taking steps ! " I came down the porch stairs and started across the lawn . One of the men looked at me and I recognized Todd 's father , Cliff . His face was tight and angry , one solid mass pissed expression . I did n't know the other man . " You ca n't be swinging on people , sir , " another cop said . " If there 's a problem , you call us . " " I called you assholes when they busted my window and spray painted " scab bastard " on my sidewalk ! All I got was a bored file clerk who took my statement and no action ! You ca n't protect me , damnit , I 'll do it myself ! " " Sir - " " What do you expect ? " Cliff said . " Half his brain is meatless . Fucking chiphead . " I stopped . Everyone stopped , even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move was my Dad . He growled deep in his throat , hunched down , and swung his left fist . I heard the biting snap as he connected , saw Cliff stagger backward . I shouted something . Two of the cops moved to intercept Dad , but he twisted around and slipped their grip and hit Cliff again . This time he went down . The other man bolted and ran . Dad dropped onto Cliff 's chest and began driving punches . I ran forward and tried to pull him off . He did n't look around , just whipped out his arm and threw me back . Then the cop with my bat stepped up and rammed it into Dad 's back , between his shoulder blades . He arched backward and almost fell over . He threw one more punch and the cop hit him again . Dad toppled sideways off of Cliff , who scrambled backward . " Jesus , the man 's crazy ! " Cliff yelled . His face was dark with blood running from his nose and mouth . He got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure Dad , but he managed to get to his feet first . One of the cops snagged his shirt , but Dad whirled around and the sleeve ripped . His eyes were large , scary in the flashing lights , and he dodged the cops one more time and went after Cliff . I jumped up and tried to stop him . I got my arms around him , but he just walked with me . I screamed at him to stop , calling his name over and over . He turned then and tried to pry me off . My grip broke and I fell away . He started for Cliff again . I ran forward and wrapped my arms around his shoulders - and sparks danced over my eyes , all my muscles seized up . I could n't let go , I could only watch his face contort , eyes bulging , tongue pressing out between his teeth , and I could smell a faint odor of burning plastic . We jerked in place together until finally the current from the police taser cut off and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see clearly and my entire body felt bruised . I rolled back and forth , right on the verge of passing out . Something sharp bit into my left side and I reached down to find the prong of the taser jabbing me . I pulled it out and sat up . Dad was down jerking like an epileptic . " Dad ! " I crawled toward him . He would n't stop twitching . I grabbed his shoulders to try to stop him . His convulsions were tremendous . That close I could smell burning and I could hear a faint buzzing . " Call an ambulance ! " I screamed . " Call an ambulance ! You hit him in the head ! Call an ambulance ! " I kept screaming it until the EMS unit arrived . It was just a taser , but the EMS people said that the voltage was enough to scramble the implants . The cop had fired right when I grabbed Dad and the current passed through me into him and fried his skull . The bolt disrupted everything , heated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brain . Todd finally dropped a line on the net . " Hey , I made it out . Are you going to file a grievance ? After that , we can be friends again . " But it did n't work that way . Mom came home , handled all the funeral arrangements with the competence I had always found comforting , and the insurance was enough to get us a brand new surrogate . Dad , it turned out , had n't lost his status with the brotherhood and the IAMS even transferred his pension to my account for the day I registered and acquired my own robot . We were provided for . Mr. Jay had been right . I did n't have to leave school after all . The problem solved itself and everything passed . In a way it had always been solved . Dad 's stroke had pretty much killed him from the first , he just had n't finished dying . There was some money from the brainshare Howard had set him up with and nobody said anything about it . In time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've lost most of their appeals . That meant I could go to almost any school I chose . I talked to Mom a couple of times about opting out of the local and going for a non-union school . At first she was uncomfortable , but I think she 's coming around to it . It 's become pretty obvious that I just do n't have the right attitude to stay with a local . Belonging seems to mean having the proper set of prejudices . Cliff only called once to say he was sorry . Keith and Pete and Kyle and the others keep asking me if I want to get together with them again . They honestly do n't seem to understand why I always say no . If Ellen thought falling stars were romantic , Lou figured she 'd melt for an impact crater demonstration . <p>
