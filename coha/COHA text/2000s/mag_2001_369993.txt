Mel Brooks is sitting near the back of the almost deserted St. James Theatre a couple of hours before curtain time . A reporter is at his right , yet Brooks stares straight ahead at the empty stage while he talks , as if he ca n't quite believe what will soon be born there . Most people with a big Broadway show about to open would be busy making fixes , rewriting lines , fighting anxiety . Brooks is mainly feeling recharged , in the way 74-year-old comic legends rarely are . " I have n't been this happy since I did my first sketch on Your Show of Shows with Sid Caesar , " he says . " I 'm back doing what I was born to do . And I love it . " <P> What 's not to love ? The Producers , a musical based on Brooks ' 1968 movie , opens on Broadway next week with the kind of rapturous buzz ( and $13 million in advance sales ) not seen since The Lion King . Start with a presold audience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed ) about a schlocky Broadway producer who connives with his nervous accountant to raise money for an awful Nazi musical so they can abscond with the funds when the thing flops . Add the best-possible modern substitutes for stars Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder  --  Nathan Lane as producer Max Bialystock and Matthew Broderick as nebbishy Leo Bloom  --  and Broadway 's hottest musical director , Susan Stroman ( Contact , The Music Man ) . Support them with a gaggle of Broadway backers so eager that one producer had to hold a lottery to decide which of his investors got the privilege of putting money into the show . " I told them we 're all fools , " Brooks recounts . " We should have a secret meeting in the cellar of the St. James Theatre , raise $25 million , put on a million-dollar failure and split it up . I do n't know why , at the last minute they all backed out . " <P> Smart guys ; they 've seen the show . The Producers is , first of all , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of Brooks ' famous lines and bits are here , including the memorable Springtime for Hitler production number , staged by Stroman with goose-stepping pizazz . The new songs  --  Brooks wrote the music and the lyrics  --  are a sprightly retro pastiche , ranging from mock Fiddler on the Roof , to mock Astaire and Rogers , to mock Bavarian beer hall . There 's a chorus line of old ladies with walkers , a flock of pigeons doing the Nazi salute and more gay jokes than have crossed a stage since Liberace . The show delivers such a wealth of vaudeville exuberance that the few quibbles ( a rather lumpy second act ) are likely to fade away . Even if you do n't think it 's great entertainment , you got ta admit : it 's great entertainment value . <P> People had been bugging Brooks for years to turn The Producers into a musical . But he resisted them all until 1998 , when DreamWorks exec David Geffen talked him into giving it a try . " He was a pit bullterrier , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I could n't shake him . " It helped that Brooks ' movie career was in a slump ( his last feature , 1995 's Dracula : Dead and Loving It , had flopped ) and that Geffen had  --  " unbeknownst to David Geffen , but knownst to me "  --  tapped into a longtime dream of Brooks ' : to write a Broadway score .
