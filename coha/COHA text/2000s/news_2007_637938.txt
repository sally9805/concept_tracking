<p> Jennifer Dion is out for her " Saturday morning escape . " This means she is wearing one of her trademark black leotards , dangling upside down from a trapeze , her arms outstretched waiting to eventually connect with a " catcher " - a person on another flying bar she will lock arms with . <p> Ms. Dion is no wanna-be circus performer . She is an interior designer and mother of two who attends trapeze school in a nondescript warehouse five miles east of Los Angeles International Airport . Eager for a little middle-age adventure , Dion likes the brief moment of weightlessness she experiences when hurtling through the air and the Barnum &; Bailey alternative to her normal routine . <p> " This helps me get away from the kids , and I feel like the release of it also makes everything better at home , " she says . " It 's not easy , though . I 'm a mom and not as in shape as I used to be . " <p> Dion is one of a growing number of Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest form of exercise and exhilaration . For a nation that 's evolved through every craze from Jack LaLanne to bungee jumping , now comes swinging through the air , even if not always with the greatest of ease . <p> In Los Angeles - the nation 's unofficial trendsetter for all things bodily - everyone from lawyers to teachers to movie stars are grabbing aerial bars . But the trend extends well beyond this sun-dappled playground . " It is safe to say that trapeze has become a phenomenon , and it 's nationwide , " says Janet Davis , a professor of American studies and history at the University of Texas at Austin . " Things like Cirque du Soleil are now a pervasive part of the social consciousness , assuming a very central place in our culture , and the trapeze , anecdotally speaking , is at the center of this phenomenon . " <p> Little did the inventor of the flying trapeze , Jules Leotard , realize that what began in the late 19th century would one day experience a renaissance among everyday people . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that for those people who do not perform , the culture of spectacle is still very much a part of our world , " says Ms. Davis . <p> * * * <p> No sign identifies Ray Pierce 's trapeze school , just the faint whine of a swing that glides back and forth , 25 feet up . The school sits in a warehouse section south of downtown Los Angeles . The students perform on a rig outdoors . They take orientation classes inside . <p> " The first thing I tell people is that they have to learn to let go in order to fly , " says Mr. Pierce , a local trapeze guru whose wavy blond hair and rugged goatee evoke a sense of adventure . " Do n't fight the swing . Let the swing take you . " <p> Those words ring familiar to a growing number of Pierce 's students - including Rick Grandy , who 's playing the role of catcher for Dion today . Mr. Grandy , a digital artist , first experienced the trapeze several years ago at a corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a performer . I just think trapeze is fun and a great way to exercise , " says Grandy , who is transitioning to the role of instructor at Pierce 's school . <p> His girlfriend , Heather Cooper , is standing on the trapeze platform and about to perform a split - straddle the bar . Before pushing off , she yells " listo , " which means " ready " in Spanish , and then Pierce , who acts as conductor , responds with " hep ! " - trapeze talk for " charge ! " Both words are traditionally said before any trick on the flying trapeze . <p> Ms. Cooper , an antitrust and trade regulation attorney , is a former gymnast . " So I at times look for perfection , " she says . " But like practicing law , trapeze can be very technical . " <p> So technical that a couple of boutique gyms in Los Angeles have hired aerial arts specialists to teach " static trapeze , " which means the swing is hanging stationary from the ceiling . Kristy Beauvais @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles that organizes exercise classes for families . A year ago it was difficult to find a static trapeze offered in a gym setting , but Ms. Beauvais says more people are looking to the trapeze as an alternative way to stay fit . <p> " These are Hollywood families and kids , all of whom have seen many productions of Cirque du Soleil , " says Beauvais , a contemporary dancer and founder of FOCUSfish , a Los Angeles-based family circus/physical education workshop . <p> Among her students is John Midby , a film-school teacher . Dressed in silver workout shorts and a black T-shirt , Mr. Midby hangs from the static trapeze and begins swinging his body in a circular motion . His legs spin like an eggbeater , whipping up the air beneath him . " I started doing this for family fitness , and then I realized how much fun I was having , " says Midby , beads of sweat on his brow . " My kids think I 'm cool . " <p> That 's precisely the kind of thinking that motivated Arturo " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Med and start his own consulting firm , Circus Services . After teaching at the resort company for nearly a decade , more people began asking Mr. Ortiz if he could recommend a trapeze school in their hometown . <p> " It amazed me how many people were getting hooked on trapeze , " says Ortiz , who thinks people are attracted to its uniqueness . " You certainly ca n't find a trapeze rig everywhere . " <p> That 's partly because trapeze rigs are expensive - roughly $35,000 to $40,000 - and require a lot of space : An average setup spans 120 feet by 60 feet . They also take " tuning " - the tightening of cables and ropes to keep the rig full of swing and bounce . <p> The new fitness craze has its dangers : Hurtling through the air is n't like knitting . But instructors consider the activity safe . Most , if not all , trapeze schools require students to wear harnesses , which are attached to a pulley system that is controlled by the teacher . Injuries do occur , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * <p> As the trapeze fad grows , it is leading to tension between the artists and the hobbyists . Ortiz , for one , thinks trapeze has become overexposed . He believes too many people are marketing it as a workout or quick thrill , detracting from trapeze as an art form . <p> But Aloysia Gavre , who performed with Cirque du Soleil for six years , disagrees . She teaches trapeze to recreational and pre-professional students at Absolution , a Pilates studio in Los Angeles . " Some like the freedom of trapeze , some enjoy the physical challenge , " she says . " It 's not just about the performance . For me , it 's about keeping trapeze alive in the community . " <p> In many ways , trapeze as an art form may have lost some of its mystique , though . Richie Gaona runs a trapeze school in the backyard of his San Fernando Valley home . Mr. Gaona was once the youngest member of a prominent trapeze family who performed around the world . But today , yellowing pictures are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trapezist . <p> " The classic art form of trapeze is dying , " says Gaona , his voice hoarse from hosting a trapeze birthday party . " More and more people are just coming out here for fun and will likely not pursue trapeze professionally . It 's kind of sad . Families were once built on this stuff . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2007 .
