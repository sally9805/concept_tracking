The following spring , in April 1847 , Louis Daguerre stopped by the brasserie where he knew Charles Baudelaire took his meals . It was a single long room inset like a cave , wedged between a tobacconist and a haberdasher . The poet sat in the corner , brooding behind a bottle of absinthe and a demitasse of coffee . His hair had been shaved off several weeks earlier in celebration of his new prose poem  --  " The Fool and the Venus "  --  and his ponderous head seemed to gather the room 's light to a focal point . On the table in front of him smoldered a wooden pipe with an amber mouthpiece . Baudelaire looked up as Louis approached and saluted . " Mind your manners , gentlemen , here comes a member of the Legion of Honor . " A few of the drunken poets nearby raised their glasses to Louis , then returned to their brandied rants . Louis sat opposite Baudelaire and took a kerchief from his pocket to wipe his forehead . " How 's the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twin drinks . Louis examined the kerchief  --  a bloom of sweat . " Fine . Good of you to ask . " So far he 'd mentioned his prophecy only to Baudelaire . He needed to be careful ; The End was a delicate matter and he did n't want to find himself in a straight waistcoat at one of the meetings of the Institute . Baudelaire looked up . " I was about to order food . Will you join me ? " " I 'd be delighted , " said Louis . " I was thinking about some bouillon and bread for me . But that 's hardly your pleasure . We must keep our national dignitaries well fed . The true artists , on the other hand , produce better when they 're emaciated . " " I 'd be glad of some herring and eggs , " said Louis . Baudelaire picked up his pipe and went to the counter to order . He was dressed in his customary English black , from lacquered shoes to satin cravat . Louis looked around the brasserie . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and poets huddled in a din of verbiage , where the dandies and the rag-cloth romantics argued about the sheen of a winter apple , the role of virtue , the beauty of the comma . Men with pipes and chapbooks sat around the scuffed oak tables or reclined on the threadbare rose-print divans . A grave-looking man in a woolen jacket , a fez , and Cossack boots nodded repeatedly and said , " Yes , we all knew him . He was a ladies ' poet  --  moonlight and taffeta and all the rest of it . " Whenever Louis had come in here before , he could n't help feeling hated . Now he found himself avoiding eye contact with the fieriest of the fellows  --  the particularly rabid poets , the sullen painters in Basque berets  --  who might attack his bourgeois attitudes , the national pension he 'd been awarded for his daguerreotype invention . Louis watched Baudelaire return from the counter with another demitasse of coffee . " Voltaire drank seventy-two cups of coffee a day , " Baudelaire said . " He must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enlightenment be without the brown goddess ? " " Indeed . " Baudelaire plunked down and said , " And what 's Armageddon without a good cup of Costa Rican ? " " I have serious business to transact . " Louis took out a piece of paper and placed it on the table . It was a list of all the things he wanted to daguerreotype before the end of the world . Baudelaire picked it up and scrutinized it as if it were an insurance contract waiting to be signed . 1 . a beautiful woman ( naked ) 2. the sun 3. the moon 4. the perfect Paris boulevard 5. a pastoral scene 6. galloping horses 7. a perfect apple 8. a flower ( type to be determined ) 9. the king of France 10 . Isobel Le Fournier Baudelaire moved his lips as he read the list several times , then placed it back on the table , facedown . He looked appalled . " The end amounts to this ? " he said , his nose at the rim of his porcelain cup . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a daguerreotype . Can you help me find one ? " It was not easy to find nude models , though Louis had heard that artists in the studios around the Luxembourg Gardens were convincing street waifs to pose for a bowl of soup and a pinch of snuff . But he needed something more than the bared frame of a rag-and-match seller ; he needed a high-blown frailty , something worthy of oblivion . Baudelaire relit his pipe and puffed on it meditatively . It was this posture and his ethereal poetry that had earned him the nickname the Prince of Clouds . He removed a speck of tobacco from his tongue and prepared to speak with some gravity . He believed in Louis Daguerre 's apocalypse as an invention of the artistic mind , no different than a belief in God or Beauty or Piety . He enjoyed watching Louis , the pensioned scientist and artist , hatch and unfold inside this epic delusion , seeing his mind clamor at the fidget wheels of madness . Baudelaire said , " You know how I feel about this photography . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Louvre , let the geologists capture fossils , the excrement of the ancients ; but do n't touch art . Leave that to the painters . " Louis said , " I wo n't have this argument again . I 'm willing to pay you a finder 's fee . A hundred francs if you find me the right woman . " Baudelaire looked down at the list , then chased a sip of coffee with a swig of absinthe . He said , " Have you established some criteria ? The world 's last naked woman captured with a camera  --  that 's quite momentous . " " Yes , I 'm aware . " Louis ran his hands along the edge of the table . The young counter-girl arrived with a plate of hard-boiled eggs and herring , and a bowl of bouillon . They watched her as she laid out cutlery , a wisp of tawny hair hanging down from her bonnet . " What is it you want in a nude ? " Baudelaire said loudly . The counter-girl smiled , then blushed and wiped her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . " She 's new here , " Baudelaire added . Louis cracked an egg on the side of the plate and began to unpeel it . " She must have grace and youth . " " Yes . " " The curvature of the neck must be gentle , perhaps a slight sway in her back . " " I concur . " " A vitality in her cheeks . " " You 've done some work in this area , " Baudelaire said , suddenly delighted . " Neither too noble nor too common-looking . She must carry herself between airs and humility . " " A shopgirl with fiery green eyes . " " Full and crimson lips . " " I do n't think I can eat . " Baudelaire clasped his hands together and rested his chin for a moment on his fingertips . He looked out the window into the street , where a group of mourners was walking home from a funeral . " I would reconsider the apple on your list , " he said . " How so ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like the English . The Frenchman wants something darker and juicier . The end of the world , it seems to me , is a peculiarly French idea . " Louis looked down at the list and tapped his lip with his index finger . " What would you think of a pear ? " " You know I am a poet , " Baudelaire said , " and having said that , I should say that my sensibility is one of integration . I seek coherence in the cockerel cries and the street dung . I would choose your fruit the same way you choose your woman . Clearly , the queen of the fruit empire is the greengage plum  --  strange , juicy , sinister . " " But the apple represents the original sin , the fall from grace . " " Yes , and the plum represents seduction and lust , " said Baudelaire . " I knew you were the right person to consult . " " I have opinions about flowers , too . " " Tell me . " " ' Aroused flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the energy of their colors , and the heat , turning scents visible , seems to make them rise to the stars like smoke . ' " " Very nice . " " My point is , there needs to be some symmetry among your flower , your woman , and your fruit . I suggest wild roses . There it is , the divine trinity : wild roses , greengage plums , and green-eyed shopgirls . " A brief silence settled over the table . " The sun and moon were not my ideas , " Louis said . " Franois Arago , a friend at the observatory , has asked me to make some plates of them . " The fact that an esteemed man of science such as Arago wanted the sun and moon to be cataloged further suggested to Louis that human enterprise was winding down . " Seems fine . Everyone likes the sun and the moon . " Baudelaire took several mouthfuls of his bouillon . " And who is this Isobel Le Fournier ? " " A woman from the past . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Louis took a bite of his egg and refused Baudelaire the eye contact he wanted . Isobel Le Fournier was his first and only substantial love ; she had occupied his thoughts and longings for forty-four years , six months , and eleven days  --  ever since that day she had kissed him in a wine cave outside of Orlans . Baudelaire said , " Do n't look so glum . After we eat , we 'll go walking in the Latin Quarter in search of our Madonna . We 'll trawl the streets . And I 'll think of some names as well . I must know some nudes . " People stared at Baudelaire as he tapped out with a Malacca cane , his bald head tilted , shouldering into a headwind . Wooden barrels belched tar smoke , men shoveled horse manure into potholes , flanks of meat hung marbled and sinister in the darkened doorways of butcher shops . But what Louis noticed was a cabaret festooned in yellow paper lanterns and bunting , an outdoor bookstall towering with hundreds of green and vermilion clothbound volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsightly . He was growing blind to the squalor of the dying days of King Louis-Philippe 's reign . He did n't see the plank-board alleys in the Carousel District , the dark rows of bird-seller shacks , the mud-daub shanties of the tooth pullers and the dog clippers . He saw only the markets full of honey and tulle , ladies in poplin sitting for open-air concerts under a Nile-blue sky . The world , it seemed to Louis Daguerre , was drowning in plenty . As they walked through the serpentine streets of Montmartre , Louis mentally auditioned the women as nudes  --  maidens in two-wheeled charabancs , ladies in bonnets and cashmere shawls , wives and daughters displaying the subtle inflections of the body beneath calico and merino . Baudelaire said , " See anything you like ? How about that Botticelli in the blue brougham ? " Louis reeled and looked at the compact carriage . Sitting high was a woman with pinned raven hair and the raised chin of nobility . She looked as if she were being borne aloft , floating above the hubbub of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis . Baudelaire stopped beside a fruit and vegetable cart . " Do you have any plums ? " he asked the vendor . " No plums yet this year , " replied the man . " But I have some oranges from Spain . " Baudelaire 's face filled with infinite regret . Louis looked down the street and noticed a woman stepping across the flagstone pavement in front of a restaurant . She was wearing a merino dress and carrying an apple-green parasol at her side . She sat on a wooden bench in front of a fountain , impatiently waiting for her driver to fetch her . " Why are there so many queens in the Latin Quarter today ? " Louis asked . " The charm of the uncivilized , " said Baudelaire . He took Louis 's arm and led him towards the bench . " Good day , mademoiselle , may we impinge upon you for a moment ? You see , my friend and I  --  surely you know him  --  the esteemed inventor of photography , Monsieur Louis Daguerre , well , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of refinement to pose for a new series of daguerreotypes . " " How splendid , " the lady said , her eyes darting over the approaching traffic for her man and carriage . " May we sit awhile ? " Baudelaire asked . Louis bowed and said , " Madame , you must forgive my colleague 's conduct , he is a little brash in these matters . I 'm sorry if we 've troubled you . " The woman smiled curtly , then stood and walked down the street . Her green parasol flashed open and shielded the back of her neck . Louis watched her disappear into the throng of people , her parasol floating through the multitudes like an apple bobbing downstream . " Friendly , " said Baudelaire . " You lack all manners . " They sat on the bench and Baudelaire took out his pipe and lit it . He stared into the bowl of the pipe , at the pulsing orange eye of the tobacco plug . " Did you smell our mademoiselle ? " " I certainly did not . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God help our country , " said Louis . He dusted his sleeves . " Come , we 're going to execute the science of this . We 'll walk the grid , down to Palais Bourbon and east to the Pont Neuf . " " Yes , " said Baudelaire , raising his malacca cane like a sword , " we will map the city in the name of nudity . " Louis stood and clicked his heels together in a sudden display of officiousness . There was something regimental about him  --  the groomed mustache , the pomade-heavy wedge of gray hair , the Napoleonic jacket with epaulets . At fifty-nine he looked and dressed like a retired admiral . But he had a painter 's eyes : Antwerp blue and prone to fits of moisture and reflection . They walked up a small hill , Baudelaire now in front , his amber-tipped pipe clenched between his teeth . He waved at a passerby and called , " We are on a mission of the apocalypse . " Louis caught his reflection in a bakery shopwindow and noticed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He pursed his lips , then settled his mouth as his figure floated across the aqueous frontage of glass . But the seizure was already coming . The sun flared and whitened . Rivulets of sweat formed along his spine . His cravat and neck cloth restricted his breathing , and the mercury cough ascended from his groin , producing silver flashes in his peripheral vision . The taste of green copper in his mouth . He leaned against the brickwork of a building and was aware of Baudelaire standing beside him . Then the noise of the street bounded towards him , the clop and clatter of the wagons , the shriek of the vendors ' cart horses . He doubled over , hands in spasm , and fell to the street . He felt the dankness of the macadam against his cheek . A small crowd ringed him in and he could see their glaucous faces , their eyes narrowed . In the midst of the seizure , a woman stood preening her gloves . He was aware of everything  --  his own pulse , his blood breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady 's chamois gloves . He could feel his head banging against the pavement , then Baudelaire 's hand and then the slowing , the release of pressure in his jaw and rib cage , his teeth coming apart , air being drawn back into his lungs . He lay there for some time , panting . The crowd dispersed . " Are you all right ? " asked Baudelaire . " Yes , " said Louis , sitting up . A deep calm always followed the seizures . He felt hollowed out , capable of great insight . He took in the street again , became aware of the light . It was now dusk and the objects of the afternoon were slipping away ; one would position the camera obscura from a loft window to catch the diffusion of day . Nearby , a woman 's face floated inside a window . Her skin a smoky pearl , jade-green eyes , lips that curved with the grace of violin hips . Louis stood in front of the deserted wineshop and looked within  --  a cavernous interior of empty shelves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor covered with editions of La Gazette de France . " I saw her , " Louis said . " Where ? In here ? " Louis nodded . He placed a hand against the windowpane and became aware of his own reflection looking back at him . The entire shopfront was a photographic plate , and here was his own specter trapped inside the waterfilm of glass . " I do n't feel very well , " Louis said . " Let 's get a cab . I 'll take you home . " " She 's out there somewhere , " Louis said . " The woman I once loved . " " Every woman we once loved is out there alongside the women we are yet to love . They exchange tips about how to ruin us . " Baudelaire stepped into the street and flagged down a cab . As he did so , he composed the first line of a new poem : " Twilight agitates madmen . " As they rode through the Paris dusk , Louis leaned his head against the leather seat back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rumblings of insurrection in the garrets . The air was cut with the smell of paraffin and rotting oysters . Several times Louis had to cough and spit in the road , and he prayed that nobody would recognize him . When the cab pulled up in front of Louis 's apartment , Baudelaire told the driver to wait , and he helped his friend down from the carriage . Together they climbed the long flight of stairs that led to Louis 's rooftop studio . Louis gripped the railing , careful not to stumble . At the landing , he handed Baudelaire the key from his waistcoat and they went inside . " Let 's put you to bed , " Baudelaire said as they moved through the darkened interior . The main room was cluttered  --  tripods , zinc cameras , copper plates , tall glass jars filled with briny-looking solutions , salts heaped into earthenware bowls . Baudelaire found the air decidedly pickled . He helped Louis into the bedroom , where the walls were covered in daguerreotypes , portraits and landscapes framed under glass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoes . " We 're having a party at my house in a few weeks . It 's going to be very elaborate , " Baudelaire said . " There will be schools of minnow . " " What does that mean ? " asked Louis , his eyes closed . " Women fluttering by the curtains . I 've thought of some nudes for your project . " " Excellent . " Baudelaire patted Louis on the shoulder . " Should I pour you some brandy ? " " No , thank you . I 'll be asleep by the time you get to the bottom of the stairs . " " The nervous attacks are getting worse , " Baudelaire said . " You should see a doctor . " " With their invoice pads and leeches  --  no , thank you . " " Take care of yourself , " said Baudelaire , turning to leave . Louis heard the door close at the bottom of the stairs . His chest was on fire , a tightness that made him pinch-eyed . He reached for the brandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip , spilling some on his bedsheet . It loosened his breathing enough that he could relax and wait for sleep to settle over him . The bedroom window was open and he heard the noises of the street below  --  the submerged sounds of Paris descending into night , the shrill bell that announced showtime to the actors at a nearby theater , the street mongers calling their wares out against the brickwork alleys . Louis felt more of the deep calm . He took off his clothes and got under the swansdown quilt . He looked up at his daguerreotypes and saw that they were more eerie than beautiful . Portraits of bankers with waxed mustaches , their faces grim , old brasserie maids with henna cheeks , a sea merchant with sad tea-brown eyes , a riverside picnic where a wooden boat rippled in a wave of amber and the sun appeared as a pale ball of wax . The portraits appeared to him now as images of the dead  --  the shipwrecked , the drowned , the hangdog . Continues ...       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
