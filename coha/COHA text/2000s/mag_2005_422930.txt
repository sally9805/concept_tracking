On your marks Q I 'm a 19-handicapper and most often hit knuckleball fades or low pull-hooks with my driver . I noticed tee marks on my club toward the toe at the very bottom of the club-face . Could these marks be a sign of a swing flaw that is causing my contact problems ?  --  Dan P. , Hartford , Conn . A Tee marks are the golfer 's equivalent of an X-ray , Dan , and the type on your driver indicate that your angle of approach into the ball is too steep . To accommodate this , you pull up on the club through impact , bending your elbows prematurely rather than keeping them extended through the hit . There are two likely reasons for your last-second lifting of the club at impact : Your ball position is too far forward and your shoulders are open at address ( and therefore at impact ) . To fix these , move your ball position back about an inch , and close your stance so your right toe is behind your left heel as you address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along your stance line  --  this will eliminate the steep approach so you stop having to pull up on the club . You should see your tee marks move farther up , into the middle of the clubface . GERALD MCCULLAGH , Les Bolstad Golf Course , University of Minnesota Q I am sick of slicing and pulling my tee shots , so I videotaped my swing . On the tape , I saw that as I start my downswing I press my right knee toward the ball and spin my hips out really fast . Is this the cause of my slice ?  --  Steve R. Fort Worth , Texas A Nice job with the video , Steve . But if you do n't mind , after we answer your question we 're going to record Ferris Bueller 's Day Off over your swing . But not until we get you fixed up . The top of your backswing ( left ) looks great , but you 're right about your hips  --  they are rotating too aggressively as you swing down ( right ) . This forces you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your slices and pulls . In an ideal start to your downswing your lower body should shift toward your target . As your arms swing down , your hips and shoulders should rotate over your left leg . To get a better feel for this move , try the Happy Gilmore drill : 1 Address a ball with your driver in your usual setup . 2 Without moving your club , slide your left foot back until it 's directly next to your right foot . 3 Swing the club to the top of your backswing while keeping your feet side-by-side . 4 Step toward your target with your left foot , then start your downswing and hit the ball , making sure to finish with your weight over your front leg . Complete this drill five times and then make a normal swing . You should feel your lower body shift to the target more naturally . GLENN DECK , Pelican Hill Golf Club , Newport Coast , Calif . Q I 've always heard you should hold the club as softly as you would a baby bird . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the club ca n't be pulled out of your hands . So exactly how firmly should I hold my grip ?  --  Mark S. , Tulsa , Okla . A How much grip pressure to apply is worthless without knowing where to apply it . If you hold the club too tight or too deep in your palms you 'll miss wide right more often than a Florida State placekicker . Both of those things create excess tension that results in shots that fly too high , too short and too right . So for starters , make sure to hold the club in your fingers , not in your palms . To feel the proper amount of grip pressure , address a ball while holding your driver with the lightest possible grip . Next , hinge your wrists and tilt the shaft until the club-head is at eye level . Now make small circles in the air with the clubhead . The amount of pressure you 're now applying is the right amount for normal shots . If you can get a feel for that , you 'll possess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Members Club at Four Streams , Beallsville , Md .

" I predict that in five years the standard set will not include a 3- or 4-iron . Those clubs will be replaced by hybrids . " T.J. TOMASI , Lyman Orchards Golf Club , Middlefield , Conn .
