Remember all that stuff about hedge-fund manager George Soros making $1 billion by betting against the British pound ? Or how about the disastrous interest-rate bet that sank the Nobel prizewinners at another hedge fund , Long-Term Capital ? If you 're like me , tales of derring-do and derring-do n't at the hedgies leave you scratching for clues . Is such high-risk investing any way to build a nest egg ? <P> No . And now I can prove it . For starters , Long-Term Capital 's spectacular demise in 1998 pointed to trouble for globetrotting hedge-fund hotshots . Soros and Tiger Management 's Julian Robertson both ran aground this year . Indeed , the average hedge fund has been underperforming the S &P; 500 for four years . The hedgies , it seems , make investing a lot tougher than it needs to be . <P> Underscoring that point , one unusual hedgie , Jeff Vinik , has racked up stellar gains by taking an Everyman 's approach to investing . Vinik , the onetime manager of Fidelity 's Magellan Fund , does n't touch derivatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodities or bonds , and does n't make macro currency bets . Such high-octane strategies are the purview of many hedge funds , and the reason some of those funds have made small fortunes  --  out of very large ones . <P> Yet in four years , Vinik Asset Management has returned 440% after fees , four times the S &P; 500 . No need to scratch for clues here . Vinik relies on diversification and simple stock picking , which work so well that , at 41 , he 's just announced that he 'll retire at year-end to play with the kids . <P> Vinik 's style is known as GARP  --  growth at a reasonable price , a fairly straightforward approach . In simple terms it means buying companies whose price-earnings multiple is lower than the earnings growth rate . Think P/Es of 10 to 14 ; earnings growth of 16% to 18% . There are hundreds of stocks fitting that description most of the time . Vinik scored big by loading up early this year on drug , medical and restaurant stocks while the masses crowded into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the bubble , " a huge factor in our performance . " <P> Vinik relies on cash-flow comparisons , saying they are tougher to fudge than earnings . He avoids slow-growth industries and pays little attention to the overall market . " Adjustments due to our grand view are very minor , " he says . " We focus on fundamentals , company by company . " <P> Like a lot of us , Vinik learned that the hard way . His biggest mistakes occurred when he made too much of his grand view . While at Magellan , he famously shifted into bonds one year , only to have stocks surge ahead . The " classic mistake , " he says , is taking your eye off developments at individual companies . <P> Market timing ? It works when it occurs naturally , the product of focusing on valuations . " What looks like us timing the market is really us reacting to companies getting too expensive , " Vinik says . He 's willing to sit with cash at rare times when everything seems overpriced . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot , " Vinik says . And by making things tougher than they need to be . <P> See
