Chapter One Her parents named her Megha , which means " cloud " in Sanskrit , perhaps because she cast a gray shadow over their lives at a time when they did n't expect overcast skies . She was an unexpected , unpleasant surprise-rather late in their lives . Her father was in his forties , her mother in her thirties . When they were desperately hoping it would at least turn out to be a boy after having had two girls , now ages thirteen and eleven , she came along-another screaming infant girl-with all the wants and needs and tribulations of a female , all the burdens of a Hindu Brahmin woman . Her father never recovered from the disappointment . Her mother quietly accepted it as her destiny . Together they began to contemplate how they would ever manage to put aside enough money to pay three varadakhshinas . Dowries . Some Hindus believe that if you give your child a depressing name , you can keep evil away from it . They often apply a dot of kohl on a baby 's face to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put a hex on a flawed child . Megha was told she was an unusually beautiful baby , bright and full of energy . She often wondered if the name Megha was her spot of kohl , guaranteed to deflect the evil eye . When asked about it , her mothersaid the only reason they called her Megha was because they happened to like the name . Then there was the astrologer , a man known for his accuracy , who had cast her janam-patrika . Horoscope . He had apparently predicted a dark , threatening period in Megha 's life , when a large cloud would settle over her head , and Yama , the god of death , would pay her a visit . He was n't able to foretell exactly when ... but the menace would come , he 'd warned . It would come . It was bound to come-sooner or later . Chapter Two At the age of twenty-one , Megha Ramnath was not only married for a year but was about to be executed . In the damp , foggy darkness of the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in puzzlement , the loose end of her plain blue cotton sari tightly drawn around her slim shoulders . Had she heard correctly , or was her mind playing strange tricks on her ? Standing on her toes , she peeped into the shed 's window , secretly listening to her would-be murderers whispering , hatching their sinister plan to finish her off . There was no light anywhere except for the ominous , dull yellow glow coming from the kandeel . Lantern . It barely illuminated the woodpile leaning against the wall in the corner and the two tins of kerosene standing nearby . The concrete floor , reduced to a blotchy gray from decades of sawdust , oil stains , and dirt , looked grungier than ever . Icy fingers crept down the nape of her neck , telling her something was not quite right . What was it she sensed ? What unexplained electric charge sent chills up and down her spine ? Megha strained to listen , trying to make sense of the conversation going on inside the shed . Kuppu , the fat old calico cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremors up Megha 's legs . Was it experiencing the same eerie feeling she was ? Cats could sense danger better than humans . The leaves rustled in the nearby guava tree , making her jump . She looked up , afraid to breathe , but realized it was only some night creature stirring-perhaps a bird disturbed by Kuppu 's presence . Just then Kuppu 's back lifted in an arch-a definite sign of fear . And Megha 's breathing turned ragged . Then it dawned on her . Her large dark eyes opened wide with alarm . She was going to be killed ! Realization struck her like a punch in the stomach . Terror replaced numbing shock , sending her heartbeat soaring . Oh , God ! Could this really be happening to her ? And why ? She was an ordinary housewife with a boring life ; she had no enemies . She was considered pretty , but it could n't possibly be a reason for anyone to kill her . She had no particular talents and posed no threat to anyone . Although her life meant little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less . And yet , she was going to be murdered ! The most puzzling part of the mystery was that her executioners were none other than her husband , Suresh Ramnath , and his ferocious mother , Chandramma Ramnath . The children in the family called her Amma . In their native Kannada language , Amma meant mother , but since she was also the eldest female in the family , she was Amma to all the kids , including nieces and nephews . Even the male servant who came in daily to wash the clothes and mop the floors addressed her as Ammabai . Bai was the respectful Indian equivalent of the English term madam . Despite what was going on in the woodshed , the surrounding scene looked perfectly normal . The nondescript Ramnath home , with its sooty windows and aged concrete frame , was like many other homes in Cantonment Galli or Street-single-storied , with three bedrooms and a small backyard . The houses were dark , boxy squares rising out of the fog . The neighborhood was middle-class , where most of the women stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held office jobs or owned small businesses . Most every family had a servant come in daily for an hour or two to perform the menial tasks-not a luxury but a necessity . Very rarely did this class of folks travel for pleasure . They ate at a restaurant or went to the cinema perhaps once a month . Money was usually tight and every rupee had to be saved for the children 's futures . At this late hour , the rural town of Palgaum was asleep . Even the most vigilant watchdogs dozed in languorous abandon in the sultry humidity of the tropical October night . The last show at the movie theaters had let out and the crowds had gone home to their beds . Except for a handful of individuals who had business staying awake , like night-shift guards and policemen , nurses minding hushed hospital wards , industrious prostitutes , and the occasional nocturnal youth or drunk loitering on a darkened street , the place was tranquil . A fine , damp mist had wound its way from the river and spread like a ghostly shroud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After long hours of slogging in the kitchen to keep her husband and in-laws well-fed and content , Megha usually slept like the dead . It was her sole escape from a life she had slowly come to abhor-her only relief for those aching feet , back , and arms that resulted from shopping for endless lists of rations and hauling them home on foot , grinding spices , coconut and various kinds of batters on the heavy grinding stone , serving meals , and handling heavy pots of steaming food and buckets of bath water . One of the advantages of being so young was the ability to sink into oblivion once her head settled on the pillow each night . And yet , a little earlier , startled by an odd sound , her eyelids had flown open in an instant . It was different from the normal nightly cacophony of snores coming from her in-laws ' room . She could only hear her father-in-law , Vinayak Ramnath , or Appaji as the kids called him , snoring in the master bedroom , and her teenaged sister-in-law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the passageway . But what about Amma , her mother-in-law , the Amazon witch ? The older woman 's notorious snoring was ominously absent . It was generally riotous enough to disturb anyone within a hundred meters . Was that corpulent mass of a woman , Chandramma , lying awake ? Was she hatching another one of her twisted plans to make Megha 's life even more difficult ? After a minute , Megha recognized the peculiar sound . It was the door to the small storage shed that sat at a little distance from the rear of the house and contained their monthly supply of wood and kerosene . The hinges on the door were rusty and squeaked every time it was opened or shut . It was a familiar echo from her daily trips to the shed to haul in the wood for the kitchen and bathroom hearths . The Ramnaths were too stingy for a gas stove , and the daily bath water was heated in a big brass cauldron because electricity was both expensive and unreliable . Megha 's breath caught on the possibility that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night . Amma would surely take her to task for such carelessness . Her fierce and tyrannical mother-in-law would never tolerate incompetence on Megha 's part . A young daughter-in-law could not afford to make even trivial mistakes . A bride had to earn her keep and the right to be called a good Brahmin wife . Megha turned around in bed , wondering if her husband , Suresh , had heard the noise . She was mystified to find him missing . Generally he 'd be huddled under the sheet beside her , his bony buttocks sticking out at a strange angle , his wide-lipped mouth hanging open in deep , childlike slumber . Frowning , she glanced at the bedside clock . The neon-red digital display read 12:23 AM . The bedroom door was ajar . Where could Suresh be ? It was a warm night and she 'd wondered if he 'd gone for a glass of water . She herself had awakened perspiring . Her thick , long plait lay limply against her moist back . Her sari clung to her hips and legs . Sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric , was terribly uncomfortable and impractical , but in an old-fashioned family such as this , she was not allowed to wear nightgowns or kaftans . There were established rules of etiquette and attire for ladies . Amma had made them clear right from the beginning . " Those silly gowns and frocks that show the legs and bosoms are not allowed in our house , okay ? Ladies in our house only wear saris . " Assuming Suresh was probably in the kitchen or bathroom , Megha called out to him . She received no reply . That was when the first faint ripple of fear crossed her mind . Could a burglar have broken into their shed ? Thefts were not uncommon around this neighborhood , and wood and kerosene were expensive commodities . Her next thought made her sit up in stark alarm . Oh my God ! Someone is stealing our firewood and Suresh is trying to confront them-all one hundred and five pounds of him . They 'll crush him to a pulp ! Her heartbeat had leapt in panic . He needs my help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her long , slim legs moving rapidly despite the bulky folds of the sari and the petticoat swirling around them . She rushed through the old-fashioned kitchen , nearly stumbling over the round grinding stone before reaching the rear door leading to the covered veranda . Kuppu , the family cat , hearing Megha 's footsteps , bounced off the window sill and followed close on her heels . Standing on the veranda steps , she puzzled some more over her husband 's absence . The fog made it difficult to see much , but a faint sliver of light was visible underneath the door of the woodshed . She visualized images of Suresh lying in a pool of blood , his skinny body motionless . As far as she had determined , Suresh was incapable of defending himself against even the weakest of attacks . Suresh needed her . But what should she do ? Well , defend him , of course ! Steely determination goaded her into action . Being the youngest of three girls , she had learned to wrestle with her older sisters for everything including space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention , clothes and toys . So now she 'd put those acquired defensive moves to good use . Megha was n't about to let some petty thugs make her a widow at twenty-one . She 'd fight them with everything she had-if necessary , even give her own life to save her husband 's . It was her duty as an ideal wife . But she had to come up with a strategy . Barging into the shed like a crazed woman would n't do her any good , nor Suresh for that matter . First she had to determine the gravity of the situation . She was afraid of the dark , always had been , but something in the shed seemed to beckon her with a force that both frightened and excited her . She stepped down from the veranda . Nearing the shed , Megha heard hushed voices , barely audible . Talking burglars ? Or was it Suresh , her nave , impractical husband , actually trying to strike a compromise with the thieves ? There was only one way to find out . Despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dirt-covered yard toward the shed . She 'd been so preoccupied she nearly walked right into the big tulsi pot . Somehow she managed to break her fall by grabbing it with both hands . But she grazed her knees and nearly banged her head on its edge in the process . The holy tulsi plant was a tropical variety of basil , held sacred by Hindus . In most conservative households it was planted in a clay pot or urn anchored to the ground in the center of the courtyard-an honored place . The urn was usually painted in bright colors and the plant well-tended . It was customary for women to pray daily to the tulsi for blessings . Despite the clammy heat of the night , Megha felt goose bumps pop up along her arms , her stomach instinctively tighten . For a fleeting second she was tempted to run back to bed , pull the covers over her head and let this weird , eerie night go on without her . She wanted to be a little girl again ; she did n't want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she was not a little girl anymore ; she was a grown woman with responsibilities , and she could n't afford to shirk them . Besides , the mysterious force in the shed seemed to draw her closer . Was Suresh still alive ? Taking care to avoid the narrow band of light under the door , she edged along the side wall as noiselessly as possible and positioned herself to peer through the open window . Puzzled lines formed on her brow . There was no sign of strangers and certainly no burglars . Only Amma and Suresh were inside the shed . A stench suddenly assailed her nostrils . Kerosene ! That potent , unexpected odor made her stomach revolt . What in heaven 's name were her husband and mother-in-law doing in there at this hour ? Why did the place reek of kerosene ? Bewildered , Megha continued to observe them in silence . This was entirely out of character . The obese and sluggish Amma should have been deep in sleep and so should Suresh . They were both heavy sleepers . And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , murmuring to each other in the dusty , rat-infested woodshed of all places . Amma wore a deep purple sari and stood with her tree-stump legs apart , in her usual militant posture , fat hands planted on her hips . Even in the pale light cast by the lantern her face was plainly visible . Perspiration glistened on her dark-coffee skin as she stared at a crude bed fashioned out of crisscrossed logs of firewood lying on the floor . " Suresh , make sure the kerosene is soaked into the wood , boy . It has to catch fire quickly and burn for a long time , " she instructed . Burn valuable wood in the middle of the night ? For what purpose ? Tiny beads of sweat showed on Suresh 's wide forehead as he crouched on the floor beside the logs , still wearing the sky-blue pajamas he 'd worn to bed . He appeared shaky , anxious , as he looked up at his mother . But then , he was always like that around his mother . " Amma , are you sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do n't be silly , " snorted Amma . " They 're all fast asleep . " " What if they inform the police ? " " Stop worrying over nothing , boy . " " We 'll all end up in jail , Amma . " His voice sounded feeble and pleading . Jail ? Megha 's heart missed a solid beat . What kind of illegal business was her husband getting himself into ? And his own mother was leading him into it ? How come Suresh had said nothing to Megha , his wife ? She would have talked him out of it in a minute . But then , he was always Amma 's little boy , hanging on her every word-too stupid to think for himself . Amma slapped Suresh 's shoulder , making him lurch forward and nearly fall on his face . " Do n't be an idiot , Suresh . Do you see a single light on in any of the neighbors ' homes ? " " That does not mean someone is not awake , Amma , " he argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socialize with any of those low-caste people . They do n't even know us . " " But , Amma , this is still illegal . You understand that ? " " There is nothing illegal about what is right , Suresh . " Suresh merely stared at his mother , too much of a coward to stand up to her . (
