The day threatened to be pleasantly uneventful for U.S. Army Captain Jake Novacek as he dressed and got ready for another Sunday in paradise . After a hard week 's work , he thought he might go to Waikiki , lie in the sun , and stare at the attractive young women in their bathing suits . <br> His only concern was that he still ached from Saturday 's Army-Navy touch football game with other officers . They were ex-athletes like himself , but unfortunately , they were several years younger than Jake 's thirty-six and had nearly run him into the ground . Jake was larger than most at just under six feet and almost two hundred pounds , which somewhat compensated for the age disparity when he managed to catch up with one of the young navy pups . It may have been touch football , but some of the touches were damned hard . <br> Jake grimaced from a stiffness in his shoulder as he finished shaving . He was in his overnight quarters at Hickam Field 's officers ' club instead of the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one but himself to blame for the situation . But then he grinned . Touch football or not , it was fun to knock a sailor-boy officer on his ass every now and then . He checked his thick black mustache  --  which pushed the limits permitted by the army  --  and trimmed a couple of errant hairs . <br> Jake had just put on his trousers and was deciding whether to eat breakfast in town or at the officers ' club when he thought he heard thunder . At first , he ignored it , but it was sunny out ; why the thunder ? <br> As he pondered this , the sounds got closer . " Oh , shit , " he muttered . Somebody was going to get in a whole lot of trouble for scheduling gunnery practice on a Sunday morning in December . <br> Then he was on the floor and gasping for breath while his ears rang from the shock of an explosion . His small room was full of dust , and something cut his arm . <br> Jake got up and ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering , shock and disbelief on their faces . <br> " What the hell 's going on ? " Jake yelled , and no one answered . Had some asshole dropped a bomb or plunked a shell down on the wrong spot ? He felt a twinge of sorrow for the poor bastard . Then a plane flew overhead , and he saw the rising sun on its wing . <br> " Japs ! " someone yelled . " We 're being attacked by the Japs ! " <br> Another bomb landed nearby , and he felt the concussion . Jake ran in the general direction of the airfield , dreading what he would see when he got there . He knew that the planes on the ground were vulnerable . Nobody was prepared for an attack . <br> He arrived just in time to see a Jap plane peeling off from a strafing run . It passed over his head by no more than a hundred feet , and he saw the pilot 's face . It looked like the monkey-faced bastard was grinning . <br> Jake wrenched his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been parked nearly wingtip to wingtip in anticipation of a saboteur 's attempt to sabotage them , which General Short feared in these tense times . Jake had said it was a bad idea , and now , as he watched them burn and explode by the dozens , he knew he had been vindicated and hated the fact . <br> Across the runway , a pair of 37 mm antiaircraft guns pointed uselessly at the sky while their crews watched the destruction . Angered , he ran across the field to the guns , dropping to the ground when another Jap plane streaked overhead . He comforted himself with the thought that a single man foolish enough to dash across a runway was n't much of a target for a Jap in an airplane . <br> He reached the guns , where a sergeant saluted him quickly . " Sergeant , who are you and why the hell are n't you shooting at them ? " Jake yelled , his voice shaking in anger . <br> The sergeant shrugged in utter disgust . " I 'm Sergeant Steinmetz and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any . " He pointed to a storage shed . " Our ammo 's in there , and the asshole in charge will only give it to officers . I guess he thinks it 's his and not the army 's . " <br> " Then where is your officer ? " <br> " Sir , I have absolutely no idea where Lieutenant Simpkins is . " The look on Sergeant Steinmetz 's face told Jake that Simpkins was not sorely missed . It occurred to both men that the Japanese attack had stopped , and there was a dreadful silence punctuated by periodic explosions and the distant wail of sirens . <br> Jake wiped a dirty handkerchief across his sweaty brow and then over his close-cut dark hair as he turned and looked out over the ocean . From where he stood , the sea to the south looked marvelously tranquil , even normal . He turned again and saw the ruins of Pearl Harbor and the smoking , burning death of America 's military strength in Hawaii . Jake was an intelligence officer and , like others , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd recently received from General Marshall in Washington . He wondered if the Japs had attacked other areas on Oahu . Logic said they had . <br> Jake was angry at the total stupidity of it . He gathered the sergeant , commandeered a truck , and drove to the storage shed , where Jake bullied a poor supply sergeant into releasing some ammunition to them . Just for the hell of it , he also grabbed a .45 automatic and a couple of clips of ammunition . Having a weapon on his hip just made him feel better . <br> But by the time they 'd returned and loaded their guns , it looked like the fighting was over . The close-packed planes on Hickam 's runways were charred ruins , and some of the hangars and other buildings were burning . The dead and wounded lay on the ground , and other soldiers had begun to tend to them . Behind their position , they saw numerous churning clouds of black smoke that came from the warships in the harbor itself . A lot of good people had died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of them guys he 'd played football with the day before . <br> A staff car pulled up behind his guns , and a neatly dressed young lieutenant jumped out and ran over . On seeing the bars on Jake 's collar , he stopped and saluted . <br> Jake returned it briskly . " Are you supposed to be in charge here ? " <br> " Yes , sir . I 'm Lieutenant Simpkins . " <br> Jake did n't recognize him . Pearl was a large base , and he 'd been back for only a couple of months . " Where the hell 've you been ? " <br> Simpkins grimaced . " I was off base , sir , and the bombing woke me up . It took some time for me to get here . " <br> That made sense , Jake thought . If he had n't stayed late at the club the night before , he 'd have been several miles away in his own apartment . Sunday was a sleep-in and goof-off day , unless it was your turn to draw duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth . It was only luck that he 'd been on base this awful morning . Then he noticed something and drew Simpkins away from the group , where they could talk in private . <br> " Lieutenant , you shaved after you got up , did n't you ? " <br> " Yes , sir , " he muttered . <br> " Shower ? " <br> Simpkins was puzzled . " Yes , sir . " <br> " And then you had breakfast , right ? " <br> " Coffee and a doughnut , sir , " he said reluctantly . " Why ? " <br> Jake rubbed his eyes in weary disbelief . No wonder the sergeant was n't concerned about Simpkins 's absence . " You 're telling me it was more important to complete your personal ablutions and feed yourself than it was to get to the battle and defend your country ? You saw that the Japanese were attacking . Why did n't you just throw your clothes on and rush over ? Or did you think they 'd hold up the war until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied weakly , " I would have been out of uniform . " Then he realized the inanity of what he was saying . " My God . " <br> Jake shook his head . There was no way he could blame Simpkins or the supply sergeant who 'd hoarded the priceless ammo during the battle . They just did n't understand what was happening . Hell , did he ? He 'd already shaved and showered when the bombs started dropping , so he too had arrived clean for the battle . But would he have continued if the bombs had fallen only a few minutes earlier ? Jake did n't think so , but he was n't absolutely certain . Being at war was something totally new to everyone . <br> " Do n't worry , Lieutenant , there 'll be a lot of recriminations for this among the higher-ups , and not a whole lot of concern about how one lieutenant might or might not have fucked up . I 'm not so sure I 'm doing the right thing myself , but at least we 're here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was about to say something when air-raid sirens went off again . <br> " Jesus , " said Jake and looked around for an enemy . Was this a new attack , or was somebody finally getting around to sounding the alarm for an earlier one ? By his count there 'd been two distinct assaults on the Hickam Field area , with the last one several hours earlier . <br> Simpkins yelled and pointed out to sea . A long line of dots was low in the sky and approaching from the south . " My God , " Simpkins said . " They 're coming right over us . " <br> Jake told the gunners to hold their fire . The 37-millimeters had a range of about ten thousand feet , which was n't very much . The lead Japs were coming in low and fast , with other planes in long lines higher up and behind them . <br> " Now , " he yelled , and both guns opened up with a roar that was extremely satisfying . They were fighting back , and it felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going for ? " Simpkins asked through the din . " Hickam 's pretty well shot over already . " <br> Jake agreed that it did n't make sense unless they were going to make an additional strike on the ships in the harbor . However , if the smoke from the Ford Island area was any indication , they 'd been pretty well shot up also . So what was the target ? <br> Then he remembered the large cluster of oil storage tanks behind him . They were the target , not Hickam , and not the ships . <br> A Jap fighter peeled off the main group and lined up on them , daring Jake 's guns to shoot him down . The plane could n't have been twenty feet off the ground as it streaked toward them . Lights twinkled on the plane 's wings , and seconds later the ground around Jake 's guns was churned up by a storm of bullets . <br> Jake ducked and tried to claw into the earth while dust and debris covered him . In all his years in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , and he did n't like it at all . He whimpered and heard others crying and screaming . Then he heard a voice a lot like his own moaning in fear . <br> The plane was gone . He raised himself and looked around . One of his guns was destroyed , although the sergeant continued to fire the second at Jap bombers who were high overhead and out of range . They passed , and he saw their ghastly bomb loads tumble down onto the fuel tanks . <br> For a second there was silence , and he hoped they 'd missed , but then the tanks began to explode in fiery bursts of oil that rolled into the sky . They were a couple of miles away , and he could still feel the heat . God help anyone near that inferno , he thought . <br> Again Jake scanned the skies . No more planes were approaching him , and there were smoking streaks across the blue that might indicate a plane had been shot down . He hoped so . Somebody had to punish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the last ? He prayed it was . How many more could Pearl Harbor take ? <br> " Casualties , " he called out . <br> " Everyone 's okay , " Steinmetz answered , " except for the lieutenant . " <br> " Where is he ? " <br> " Over here , " the sergeant answered grimly , " and over there . " <br> Jake looked where the sergeant pointed and gagged . Simpkins had been cut in half by the Jap fighter 's guns , and the two parts of his body were about twenty feet apart , connected only by a bloody trail . <br> Jake wrenched his eyes away from the awful sight and looked skyward . Far up , he saw a couple of planes . Japs , he thought , checking on the damage they 'd done . <br> " Fuck you , " he screamed at them . " Fuck you ! " <br> Alexa Sanderson had awakened well before seven . It gave her plenty of time to put on the coffee and awaken her husband , Tim . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . It was a shame Tim had duty this wonderful Sunday morning , but that was the life of a naval officer . At least they 'd had a marvelous Saturday night , attending a concert consisting of a battle among several of the battleships ' bands . The consensus was that the Arizona 's band was the best . <br> After that , they 'd gone home , made marvelously noisy and athletic love , and then fallen asleep . <br> Tim left with plenty of time to make it from their small but expensive rented house on the outskirts of Honolulu to duty on the battleship Oklahoma . While she hated his leaving her , she was thankful that they were able to spend so much time together . So many other wives simply could n't afford to follow their husbands to their duty stations . Alexa did n't consider having money a curse , although she took great pains not to flaunt it . <br> Alexa was also thankful that she and Tim had married . She did n't think of herself as terribly pretty , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred and forty pounds . By contemporary standards , she was too tall , too athletic , too muscular , and , to compound problems , too intelligent , articulate , and outspoken for most men 's tastes . She had light brown hair , brown eyes , even features , and she thanked God that Tim had been attracted enough by the package to marry her three years earlier . <br> At least she knew he had n't married her for her money . He had even more than she did . There were those who thought Tim was dull , but she knew otherwise . He was quiet and sincere , and , better , would be out of the navy in a few months . Then they could go back home to Virginia and start the family they 'd talked about so much . <br> She turned at the sound of a pounding on her kitchen door . <br> Melissa Wilson burst in , with her infant son in her arms and concern on her face . " Do you hear it ? " <br> Melissa was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the type of buxom princess other men always seemed to lust after . Melissa , Missy to her friends , was also very excitable . <br> " Hear what ? " Alexa asked . <br> " The explosions . " <br> Continues ...
