In This Mountain By Jan Karon Viking Moles again ! Father Tim Kavanagh stood on the front steps of the yellow house and looked with dismay at the mounds of raw earth disgorged upon his frozen March grass . Holes pocked the lawn , causing it to resemble a lunar surface ; berms of dirt crisscrossed the yard like stone walls viewed from an Irish hilltop . He glanced across the driveway to the rectory , once his home and now his rental property , where the pesky Talpidae were entertaining themselves in precisely the same fashion . Indeed , they had nearly uprooted Hlne Pringle 's modest sign , Lessons for the Piano , Inquire Within ; it slanted drunkenly to the right . Year after year , he 'd tried his hand at mole-removal remedies , but the varmints had one-upped him repeatedly ; in truth , they appeared to relish coming back for more , and in greater numbers . He walked into the yard and gave the nearest mound a swift kick . Blast moles to the other side of the moon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them caught in traps and carted to the country where they might frolic in a meadow among buttercups and bluebells . And who was to do the catching and carting ? Yours truly . He went inside to his study and called the Hard to Beat Hardware in Wesley , believing since childhood that hardware stores somehow had the answers to life 's more vexing problems . " Voles ! " exclaimed the hardware man . " What most people 've got is voles , they just think they 're moles ! " " Aha . " " What voles do is eat th ' roots of your plants , chow down on your bulbs an ' all . Have your bulbs bloomed th ' last few years ? " " Why , yes . Yes , they have . " The hardware man sighed . " So maybe it is moles . Well , they 're in there for the grubs , you know , what you have to do is kill th ' grubs . " " I was thinking more about ah , taking out the moles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Even the government had jumped on the bandwagon for moles , demonstrating yet again what government had come to in this country . " So . How do you get rid of grubs ? " " Poison . " " I see . " " ' Course , some say do n't use it if you got dogs and cats . You got dogs and cats ? " " We do . " He called Dora Pugh at the hardware on Main Street . " Whirligigs , " said Dora . " You know , those little wooden propellerlike things on a stick , Ol ' Man Mueller used to make ' em ? They come painted an ' all , to look like ducks an ' geese an ' whatnot . When th ' wind blows , their wings fly around , that 's th ' propellers , and th ' commotion sends sound waves down their tunnels and chases ' em out . But you have to use a good many whirligigs . " He did n't think his wife would like their lawn studded with whirligigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on batt'ries , that you stick in th ' ground . Only thing is , I 'd have to order it special , which takes six weeks , an ' by then ... " " ... they 'd probably be gone , anyway . " " Right , " said Dora , damping the phone between her left ear and shoulder while bagging seed corn . He queried Percy Mosely , longtime proprietor of the Main Street Grill . " What can you do to get rid of moles ? " Percy labeled this a dumb question . " Catch ' em by th ' tail an ' bite their heads off is what I do . " On his way to the post office , he met Gene Bolick leaving the annual sale on boiled wool items at the Irish Woolen Shop . Gene 's brain tumor , inoperable because of its location near the brain stem , had caused him to teeter as he walked , a sight Father Tim did not relish seeing in his old friend and parishioner . " Look here ! " Gene held up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty percent off , and another twenty percent today only . Better get in there while th ' gettin 's good . " " No , thanks , the Busy Fingers crowd in Whitecap knitted me a cardigan that will outlast the Sphinx . Tell me , buddydo you know anything about getting rid of moles ? " " Moles ? My daddy always hollered in their holes and they took off every whichaway . " " What did he say when he hollered ? " Gene cleared his throat , tilted toward Father Tim 's right ear , and repeated the short , but fervent , litany . " My goodness ! " said the earnest gardener , blushing to the very roots of what hair he had left . He heard the receiver being crushed against the capacious bosom of his bishop 's secretary , and a muffled conversation . He thought it appealingly quaint not to be put on hold and have his ear blasted with music he did n't want to hear in the first place . " Timothy ! A blessed Easter to you ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thinking of you only this morning . " " Whatever for ? Some interim pulpit assignment in outer Mongolia ? " " No , just thinking that we have n't had a really decent chinwag in , good heavens , since before you went down to Whitecap . " " An eon , to be precise . " Well , a couple of years , anyway . " Come and have lunch with me , " suggested his bishop , sounding ... sounding what ? Pensive ? Wistful ? " I 'll do it ! " he said , decidedly spontaneous after last Sunday 's Easter celebration . " I 've been meaning to come for a visit , there 's something I 'd like us to talk over . I may have a crate of moles that must be taken to the country . I can release them on my way to you . " " A crate of ... moles . " " Yes . " He did n't want to discuss it further . But he could n't catch the blasted things . He prodded their tunnels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shouted into their burrows , repeating what Gene had recommended , though in a low voice ; he blew his honorary Mitford Reds coach 's whistle ; he stomped on the ground like thunder . " I give up , " he told his wife , teeth chattering from the cold . He noted the streak of blue watercolor on her chin , a sure sign she was working on her current children 's book starring Violet , the real-life white cat who usually resided atop their refrigerator . " But you just started ? " " Started ? I 've been working at it a full half hour . " " Ten minutes max , " Cynthia said . " I watched you , and I must say I never heard of getting rid of moles by shouting down their tunnels . " He pulled his gloves off his frozen hands and sat on a kitchen stool , disgusted . His dog sprawled at his feet and yawned . " I mean , what were you saying when you shouted ? " He had no intention of telling her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , you do the catching and crating , and I 'll haul them to the country . A fair division of labor . " He was sick of the whole business . Cynthia glared at him as if she were his fifth-grade teacher and he a dunce on the stool . " Why do n't you just stop fretting over it , Timothy ? Let them have their day ! " Have their day ! That was the artistic temperament for you . " But they 're ruining the lawn I 've slaved over for years , the lawn you dreamed of , longed for , indeed craved , so that you might walk on it barefootand I quoteas upon a bolt of unfurled velvet . " " Oh , for heaven 's sake , did I say such a silly thing ? " He rolled his eyes . " Timothy , you know that if you simply turn your head for a while , the humps will go down , the holes will fill in , and by May or June , the lawn will be just fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't the point . " I love you bunches , " she said cheerily , trotting down the hall to her studio . He pulled on his running clothes with the eagerness of a kid yanked from bed on the day of a test he had n't studied for . Exercise was good medicine for diabetes , but he did n't have to like it . In truth , he wondered why he did n't enjoy running anymore . He 'd once enjoyed it immensely . " Peaks and valleys , " he muttered . His biannual checkup was just around the bend , and he was going to walk into Hoppy Harper 's office looking good . As the Lord 's Chapel bells tolled noon , he was hightailing it to the Main Street Grill , where a birthday lunch for J. C. Hogan would be held in the rear booth . Flying out the door of Happy Endings Bookstore , he hooked a left and crashed into someone , full force . Edith Mallory staggered backward , regained her balance , and gave him a look that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terribly sorry . " " Why do n't you watch where you 're going ? " She jerked the broad collar of a dark mink coat more securely around her face . " Clergy , " she said with evident distaste . " They 're always preoccupied with lofty thoughts , are n't they ? " Not waiting for an answer , she swept past him into Happy Endings , where the bell jingled wildly on the door . " ' Er High Muckety Muck traipsed by a minute ago , " said Percy Mosely , wiping off the table of the rear booth . Father Tim noted that the slur of her perfume had been left on his clothes . " I just ran into her . " " I 'd like t ' run into ' er ... , " said the Grill owner , " with a eighteen-wheeler . " If there was anyone in town who disliked Edith Mallory more than himself , it was Percy Mosely , who , a few years ago , had nearly lost his business to Edith 's underhanded landlord tactics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought her nefarious ambitions to utter ruin . Thus , if there was anyone in town whom Edith Mallory could be presumed to despise more than Tim Kavanagh , he did n't have a clue who it might be . " Ever ' time I think I 've seen th ' last of that witch on a broom , back she comes like a dog to ' is vomit . " " Cool it , Percy , your blood pressure ... " " An ' Ed Coffey still drivin ' ' er around in that Lincoln like th ' Queen of England , he ought t ' be ashamed of his sorry self , he 's brought disgrace on th ' whole Coffey line . " J. C. Hogan , Muse editor and Grill regular , slammed his overstuffed briefcase into the booth and slid in . " You 'll never guess what 's hit Main Street . " Percy looked fierce . " Do n't even mention ' er name in my place . " " Joe Ivey and Fancy Skinner are locked in a price war . " J.C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped his face . " A price war ? " asked Father Tim . " Head to head , you might say . Fancy had this big sign painted and put in her window upstairs , said , Haircuts Twelve Dollars , All Welcome . First thing you know , Joe puts a sign downstairs , says , Haircuts Eleven Dollars . " Joe Ivey 's one-chair barbershop was located in a former storage room behind the kitchen of his sister 's Sweet Stuff Bakery . The only other game in town was Fancy Skinner 's unisex hair salon , A Cut Above , which rented the upstairs area over the bakery . " Poetic irony , " is what one Grill customer called the arrangement . " So Fancy cranks her price down to ten bucks and has her sign repainted . Then Joe drops his price , changes his sign , and gives me an ad that says , Haircuts nine-fifty . Free chocolate chip cookie to every customer . " " Cutthroat , " said Percy . " I do n't know where this 'll end , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now 's the time . " " Happy birthday . Father Tim thought they should get to the point . " Right . Happy birthday ! " said Percy . " You can be one of th ' first to order offa my new menu . " J.C . scowled . " I was used to the old menu . " " This is my an ' Velma 's last year in this hole-in-th ' - wall , I wanted to go out with a bang . " Percy stepped to the counter and proudly removed three menus on which the ink was scarcely dry and handed them around . He thought the Wesley printer had come up with a great idea for this new batchthe cover showed the Grill motto set in green letters that were sort of swirling up , like steam , from a coffee mug : Eat here once and you 'll be a regular . " Where 's Mule at ? " asked Percy . " Beats me , " said Father Tim . " Probably getting a haircut . " " So how old are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned . " Fourteen goin ' on fifteen is what Adele says . " " Gag me with a forklift , " said Mule , skidding into the booth . " He 's fifty-six big ones , I know because I saw his driver 's license when he wrote a check at Shoe Barn . " " OK , give me your order and hop to it , Velma 's havin ' a perm down at Fancy 's and I 'm shorthanded . Free coffee in this booth , today only . " " I do n't want coffee , " said Mule . " I was thinkin ' more like sweet ice tea . " " Coffee 's free , tea 's another deal . " J.C . opened his menu , looking grim . " You spelled potato wrong ! " he announced . " Where at ? " asked Percy . " Right here where it says tuna croissant with potatoe chips . There 's no e in potato . " " Since when ? " " Since ever . " Look who 's talking , thought Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mule . " Taco salad ! Can you sell taco salad in this town ? " " Taco salad , " muttered Percy , writing on his order pad . " Wait a minute , I did n't say I wanted taco salad , I was just discussin ' it . " " I do n't have time for discussin ' , " said Percy . " I got a lunch crowd comin ' in . " Father Tim noticed Percy 's face was turning beet-red . Blood pressure , the stress of a new menu ... " So what is a taco salad , anyway ? " asked Mule . The Muse editor looked up in amazement . " Have you been livin ' under a rock ? Taco salad is salad in a taco , for Pete 's sake . " " No , it ai n't , " said Percy . " It 's salad in a bowl with taco chips scattered on top . " Mule sank back in the booth , looking depressed . " I 'll have what I been havin ' before th ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hold th ' mayo . " " Do you see anything on this menu sayin ' pimiento cheese ? On this menu , we do n't have pimiento cheese , we ai n't goin ' to get pimiento cheese , and that 's th ' end of it . " The proprietor stomped away , looking disgusted . " You made him mad , " said J.C. , wiping his face with his handkerchief . " How can a man make a livin ' without pimiento cheese on his menu ? " Mule asked . " ' Less you want to run down to th ' tea shop and sit with th ' women , there 's nowhere else to eat lunch in this town ... " J.C . poked the menu " so you better pick something offa here . How about a fish burger ? Lookit , four ounces breaded and deep-fried haddock filet served on a grilled bun with lettuce , tomato , and tartar sauce . " " I do n't like tartar sauce . " Father Tim thought he might slide to the floor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salad ! " he announced , hoping to set an example . Mule looked relieved . " Fine , that 's what I 'll have . " He drummed his fingers on the table . " On the other hand , you never know what 's in a chef 's salad when you deal with this chef . " " I 'm havin ' th ' tuna melt , " said J.C. , " plus th ' fish burger and potato skins ! " " Help yourself , " said Mule . " Have whatever you want , it 's on us . " He peered intently at the menu . " Chili crowned with tortilla chips and cheese , that might be good . " " Here he comes , make up your mind , " snapped J.C . " I 'll have th ' chili deal , " said Mule , declining eye contact with Percy . " But only if it comes without beans . " Percy gave him a stony look . " How can you have chili without beans ? That 's like a cheeseburger without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Or a BLT without bacon . " Father Tim closed his eyes as if in prayer , feeling his blood sugar plummet into his loafers . So what are you doing these days ? It was a casual and altogether harmless question , the sort of thing anyone might inquire of the retired . But he hated it . And now , on the heels of the very same question asked only yesterday by a former parishioner ... " So what'n th ' dickens do you do all day ? " Mule had left to show a house , J.C . had trudged upstairs to work on Monday 's layout , and Percy stood beside the rear booth , squinting at him as if he were a beetle on a pin . After nearly four years of retirement , why had n't he been able to formulate a pat answer ? He usually reported that he supplied various churches here and there , which was true , of course , but it sounded lame . Indeed , he once said , without thinking , " Oh , nothing much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt covered with shame . In his opinion , God had n't put anyone on earth to do " nothing much . " Thus , in the first year following his interim at Whitecap , he 'd given endless hours to the Wesley Children 's Hospital , second only to the church as his favorite charitable institution . He had even agreed to do something he roundly despised : raise funds . To his amazement , he had actually raised some . ( Continues ... )
