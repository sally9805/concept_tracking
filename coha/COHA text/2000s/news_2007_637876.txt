<p> In December 1992 , in a suite at the San Francisco Hilton , Peter Magowan met with Dennis Gilbert , then the agent for Barry Bonds . Magowan 's incoming ownership group feverishly sought to re-energize a sagging fan base , and the hotel meeting formally set in motion Bonds ' return to his childhood home  --  and launched an extraordinary era in Giants history . <p> Nearly 15 years later , Bonds is still wearing a San Francisco uniform as he nears one of the most cherished records in sports : He needs only two more home runs to match Hank Aaron 's all-time mark of 755 . But Bonds ' impact on the franchise stretches beyond this historic chase and resonates on many levels . <p> On the field , Bonds revitalized the Giants by leading them to perpetual contention ( nine winning records in his first 12 seasons ) , four playoff appearances and one trip to the World Series . He has won five Most Valuable Player awards since joining the team , became the cornerstone of long-stalled efforts to build a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned the Giants into one of the game 's top draws . <p> At the same time , Bonds dragged the Giants into the BALCO steroids scandal by becoming its centerpiece , scorned around the nation as the face of rampant cheating in baseball . He remains the subject of a federal perjury investigation and a major figure in former Sen. George Mitchell 's probe of performance-enhancing drug use in the majors . And in the minds of many Giants fans , the club 's unwillingness to part with Bonds has delayed a long-overdue rebuilding effort and contributed to the team 's recent struggles . <p> The Giants and Bonds made for awkward dance partners the past four years , as BALCO fallout clashed with his star power  --  his presence helped attract more than 3 million fans season after season , even as San Francisco posted losing records in 2005 and ' 06 . <p> " Barry 's made the organization a whole bunch of money , and he 's paid a lot of bills for a lot of people , " said former manager Dusty Baker , now an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been rosy , but there are times it 's not rosy in any 15-year marriage . " <p> After nearly 15 full seasons of Bonds , the Giants find an entirely different landscape than the one Magowan , the managing general partner , inherited . His group bought the team for $100 million ; according to Forbes Magazine , the Giants now are worth an estimated $459 million , making them the seventh-most valuable franchise in the majors . ( That estimate includes AT &T; Park , said to be worth $131 million . ) <p> They play in a spiffy , accessible , state-of-the-art ballpark , not dank , remote , wind-swept Candlestick Park . Attendance will soon top 3 million for the eighth consecutive season , the third-longest such streak in the majors . That run started when the Giants moved into their new China Basin home in 2000  --  and some observers believe the new home would not have been built without Bonds on the roster . <p> Bay Area sports fans still covet professional football above all else , but they clearly have found a spot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We are also a baseball town now , " Magowan said during a recent interview in his office overlooking Willie Mays Plaza , " and I trace a lot of that to Barry . " <p> As Magowan noted , it helped that the Giants had the third-best record in the majors from 1993 through 2004 , behind the Yankees and Braves , and that their bayside ballpark became a magnet in its own right . <p> Those factors are inextricably linked to the presence of Bonds , the game 's biggest attraction and most polarizing star . He missed all but 14 games in 2005 because of three surgeries on his right knee  --  and the Giants not only had their first losing season since 1996 , they also saw average home attendance dip below 40,000 for the first time since the ballpark opened . <p> More striking was the impact Bonds ' absence had on road attendance . The Giants ranked second in the National League in road attendance every year from 2001 through ' 04 . The average crowd for a Giants road game in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was more than 36,000 . <p> The next year , with Bonds shelved nearly the entire season , the average fell to 31,740 , abruptly dropping the Giants to 10th in the NL . They hopped back to fifth last season , with Bonds playing again , and they ranked third this season entering the weekend . <p> " Whether you love Barry Bonds or hate Barry Bonds , you still watch Barry Bonds , " said Jeff Borris , Bonds ' current agent . <p> It 's worth remembering where the Giants stood in the years before Bonds arrived . They won 92 regular-season games and advanced to the World Series in 1989 , but the three seasons to follow were progressively less attractive  --  85 wins , 75 wins and 72 wins . The Giants finished fifth in the National League West in 1992 , 26 games behind division champion Atlanta . <p> Not surprisingly , attendance plunged at Candlestick . The Giants averaged 26,074 spectators during their pennant-winning season in ' 89 , but that number steadily dropped the next three years , reaching 19,759 in ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly struck out in his attempts to build a new ballpark . Lurie lost four ballot initiatives aimed at replacing Candlestick : two in San Francisco ( 1987 and ' 89 ) , one in Santa Clara ( ' 90 ) and another in San Jose ( ' 92 ) . All four proposals involved public funding . <p> After the rejection in San Jose , Lurie agreed to sell the club to a group from St. Petersburg , Fla . San Francisco was on the brink of losing major league baseball until another group headed by Magowan bought the Giants  --  and brought Bonds aboard even before the sale became final . <p> " We thought this guy could spark the team and get the fans re-enthused about the game , which we were very worried about , " Magowan said . " I mean , we were buying into a baseball team in a town where the interest in baseball was really declining . " <p> The Giants , powered by Bonds , instantly soared into a memorable pennant race with the Braves in 1993 . San Francisco won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the season . Bonds won the MVP award , hitting .336 with 46 homers and 123 RBIs . <p> Attendance jumped from 1.56 million in 1992 to 2.6 million the next season ( an average of 32,177 ) . The Giants also became a much bigger attraction on the road , drawing nearly 2.8 million fans in 1993 , an increase of almost 750,000 over ' 92 . <p> They suddenly were more than just another team , largely because of their flashy , productive left fielder . <p> " Barry obviously immediately made the Giants a lot better , but I also think this became a franchise people targeted because of him , " longtime broadcaster Duane Kuiper said . " I mean , this is a guy with a lot of confidence . When he was a little younger , he was as flamboyant as they came . And when you 're sitting in the other dugout , you want to beat those guys . " <p> Even as the Giants sagged in 1994 and ' 95 , and attendance waned again in the wake of the players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the efforts to flee Candlestick picked up steam . San Francisco voters finally approved a ballpark plan by a 2-to-1 ratio in March 1996 , largely because the measure did not require taxpayer assistance . Magowan insisted the Giants could have gained voter approval and built the park without Bonds , but his presence certainly bolstered the cause . <p> More than a decade later , as fans still flock to China Basin , the relevant question is : What will happen to attendance when Bonds is gone ? He turns 43 on Tuesday , after all , and the Giants have struggled even with him in the lineup the past season and a half . At some point , he will stop playing  --  and there will be no Bonds , no home-run count and no All-Star Game to stir excitement . <p> History says the red-brick ballpark at Third and King streets eventually will stop bringing droves of folks out to watch the Giants . There are many examples of new ballparks causing a spike in attendance , only to see the crowds dwindle when the novelty wears off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3.7 million fans at Camden Yards in 1997 , fell below 3 million in 2002 and sank to 2.15 million last season . Cleveland peaked at nearly 3.5 million in 1999 , dropped below 3 million in ' 02 and plummeted to 1.7 million in ' 03 . Arizona , Atlanta and Colorado also endured drops of more than 1 million in season attendance , between a peak in the late 1990s and recent years . <p> So far , the Giants have been uniquely averse to this trend , with a modest decline of 147,000 from their peak attendance season ( 2001 , when Bonds hit his record 73 homers ) to last year , when they drew a China Basin-low 3.13 million . <p> The effect of opening a new stadium is worth tens of millions of dollars over a three- to four-year period before the excitement fizzles , said Rodney Fort , a professor of sports management at the University of Michigan who has done extensive research on major league baseball finances . " After that , it 's all about players . ... In the Giants ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stadium or is it Bonds ? ' I think you 'd have to say it 's mostly Bonds . " <p> Said Paul Swangard , managing director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of Oregon : " There has been immense entertainment value in having Barry Bonds on the team . If someone pays $150 to see Bonds and his head falls off coming around third base , it 's entertainment . He 's a circus sideshow in some ways , but that gets some people who may not be core baseball fans and who have choices in their entertainment spending . " <p> As they reaped the benefits of having Bonds all these years , the Giants made a trade-off . Bonds demanded uncommon freedom and the Giants largely acquiesced , most notably in allowing him to bring his personal trainers  --  including Greg Anderson  --  into the clubhouse in violation of Major League Baseball rules . <p> Anderson , a regular presence in the players ' sanctuary from 2000 until ' 03 , later pleaded guilty to distributing steroids . His access to the ballpark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco players  --  outfielders Armando Rios and Marvin Benard and catchers Benito Santiago and Bobby Estalella  --  were identified as having received banned drugs from the trainer , according to court documents in the BALCO case . <p> By the time Bonds ' five-year , $90 million contract expired after last season , his connections to Anderson , BALCO and steroids had become common knowledge , as had the team 's history of catering to him . Plus , the Giants ' front office reportedly knew Bonds tested positive for amphetamines during the ' 06 season . <p> Asked about re-signing Bonds  --  given the perjury investigation , the continuing Mitchell investigation and the positive amphetamines test  --  Magowan said , " There were reservations , and they all had to be put in the hopper . The investigation has gone on for 3 1/2 years , and it might go on for another 3 1/2 years . But we 've got to run a business and put a ballclub on the field . The charges are still charges , nothing has been proved . " <p> Magowan said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrificed their integrity to re-sign Bonds . Asked if he understood the belief , in some corners , that the Giants were partly complicit in the steroids scandal for letting Anderson into their clubhouse , Magowan curtly said , " I 'm not going to get into all of that . There will be a time when that 's appropriate , and it 's not now . " <p> Giants management seemed conflicted by the decision to re-sign Bonds , but it ultimately did and now he 's bearing down on Aaron 's record . Bonds has shaped the Giants in many ways in this wild decade and a half  --  from postseason exhilaration to World Series heartbreak , from the Splash Cam to kayaks jostling for position in McCovey Cove , from the roiling controversy to the rising frustration of the past few seasons . <p> It will take a long time for history to judge exactly what Bonds has meant to the Giants . He helped them win , led them into a new ballpark , brought in gobs of money and thrust them squarely into the hazy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chooses to judge Bonds ' legacy on what he did on the field . <p> " Fifty years from now , " Magowan said , " I think people will be able to say the Giants had the best player in baseball for almost 40 years , Willie Mays and Barry Bonds . That 's a huge part of our history and tradition . " ( 1 ) Barry Bonds , the Giants left fielder Saturday in Milwaukee ( above ) and for 15 seasons , has also been the team 's money man .
