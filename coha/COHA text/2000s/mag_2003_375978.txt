Hey , here 's a really horrendous idea for a novel ! Two boys growing up together on a bad block in Brooklyn , N.Y. , in the 1970s  --  one 's white and introverted , and one 's black and cool . The white kid 's name is Dylan , and the black kid is called Mingus . And they can fly . Want me to go on ? Not really ? But listen : if you skip out now , you 'll miss one of the richest , messiest , most ambitious , most interesting novels of the year . <P> The hero of Jonathan Lethem 's The Fortress of Solitude ( Doubleday ; 511 pages ) is smart , scrawny , sensitive Dylan Ebdus . He 's 5 when his parents move to a hard-luck black and Puerto Rican neighborhood in Brooklyn . His mom is a hippie , his dad a painter who spends his days on an incomprehensible , unfinishable masterpiece . Soon Mingus Rude moves in down the block . His father Barrett is a once famous soul singer  --  he fronted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline ( Barrett owes more than a little to Marvin Gaye ) . The boys become friends  --  Mingus the leader , Dylan the follower  --  and Lethem spends much of the novel carefully mapping out the social dynamics of their microcosmic Brooklyn block : the ball games , the one empty house , the guy who 's always washing his car , a bully drawn with scary accuracy . You can practically hear the kids ' voices as they goof on Dylan 's name : " D-Man , " " John Dillinger , " " D-Lone , " " Lonely D , " " Dill-icious . " Ho , snap ! Halfway through the book , you could draw the block from memory . <P> Lethem nails the small stuff with such relentless perfection  --  Mad magazine , the Fantastic Four , graffiti tags , Car Wash , Star Wars  --  that we get the big picture too , the story of the 1970s told as a painful national adolescence . Soul begets funk begets rap . Cigarettes lead to weed , which gives way to cocaine , which leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder and quieter , Dylan nerdier but more confident . Yet a slender but tough strand still connects the boys , and they fight against all the usual suspects  --  racism , violence , their parents ' failing marriages  --  to keep it . In the novel 's second half , really an extended epilogue , Lethem follows his principals into lives rendered bitter and crooked by the unresolved anger of their Brooklyn beginnings . <P> Lethem is one of those novelists who get better book by book , from his early science-fiction noodlings to the hard-boiled , atmospheric Motherless Brooklyn . The Fortress of Solitude is a glorious , chaotic , raw novel , and God knows there are any number of ways to pick it apart . Lethem has adopted a furiously literary , poetic style that would look overwrought in the pages of an undergraduate literary magazine , and he gambles on a risky element of magical realism : the boys discover a magic ring that intermittently ( it 's capricious ) gives them superpowers . But Lethem grabs and captures 1970s New York City , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys whom an entire city could n't tear apart . <P>  --  By Lev Grossman
