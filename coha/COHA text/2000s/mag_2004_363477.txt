Life is so simple when you are at the back of the pack . No one picks on you , and no one picks up on your gaffes . When the Democratic presidential race started to take shape a year ago , few bothered to attack the quirky doctor who was an ex-Governor of a small New England state . He barked and blustered , but the Democratic establishment and the media saw in him little more than entertainment value . He stood on the wrong side of a popular President 's war and outside the party establishment , within which the winner would be anointed in due course . <P> It is more complicated at the top of the heap . Now former Vermont Governor Howard Dean leads the eight other Democrats by every measure that matters ( at least until people start voting ) : in polls , money , organization and enthusiasm . As the Democratic front runner , with only two weeks to go before the presidential race begins in Iowa , Dean is being pummeled from every angle , and his every assertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks , he has declared that the U.S. is no safer with Saddam Hussein in captivity , mused about an " interesting theory " that President George W. Bush was tipped off about 9/11 by the Saudis , whined that Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe should stop the other candidates from assailing him and hinted that if he does not win the nomination , his legions of followers might not show up to vote in November . A lot of people have been wondering , What is he thinking ? <P> So we asked him . Dr. Dean does not get many opportunities to make a diagnosis these days . Maybe that is why he responded so readily last week to an invitation to deliver one for himself . There was no examination table in the cramped six-seater jet that was taking him home to Vermont for a New Year 's break . Instead Dean stretched his stocking feet into the seat across from him for a two-hour discussion of who he is and how he thinks , dissecting the instincts that have made him the one to beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it harder for him to make it all the way to the White House . <P> If you want to understand how Howard Dean thinks , he says , it helps to look at the way he and his doctor-wife Judith Steinberg treated patients in their family practice back in Vermont . " She 's very methodical . She 'll exhaust all the possibilities until she gets to the one that 's the most likely , " he explains . " I 'm intuitive , and I jump steps ahead . Part of what gets me in trouble on the stump is that I shorthand things . I know what I 'm thinking , but I do n't say every word of it . I was that way as a doctor . I eliminate possibilities unconsciously , before they get to my consciousness . It 's also part of my political judgment . I often know I want to do things before I know why , although the thinking goes on all the time . The way I think is , if you give me information , I tuck it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and work on it without being aware of it . All of a sudden , 10 months later , something will pop out , based on a whole series of things that I 've learned in the last 10 months . And finally , all of a sudden , it falls into place .
