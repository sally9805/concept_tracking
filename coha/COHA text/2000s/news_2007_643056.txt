<p> The closest Strauss Zelnick usually gets to playing video games is watching over the shoulders of his two young sons . Mr. Zelnick concedes that his gaming skills are better suited for Pong and Pac-Man than Grand Theft Auto , the smash hit from the company that he is now in charge of turning around . <p> But when the stock price of Take-Two Interactive Software slipped under $10 last summer as inquiries into its business practices began to mount , Mr. Zelnick , a veteran of the movie and music industries , saw a potential bargain for his investment firm . <p> He and his partners at ZelnickMedia first weighed taking the company private , but decided that would be too complicated . So instead , Mr. Zelnick started approaching Take-Two 's largest shareholders one by one to sell them on his plan to take over the board . <p> His efforts culminated two weeks ago at Take-Two 's annual shareholder meeting in New York , when all but two board members were removed . Two hours after the meeting adjourned , the company announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed one of his close deputies as chief executive . <p> " We hit the ground running , " Mr. Zelnick said in an interview yesterday over breakfast in Midtown Manhattan . " We have to clean the company up , and then operate in a pristine manner going forward . " <p> Mr. Zelnick has taken on risky corporate overhauls in the past , but none have been as complex as the turnaround of Take-Two , which he called " the biggest thing we 've done . " <p> Beyond the issue of whether the company can reverse its uneven sales and become more than a one-hit wonder , there are the legal problems , which seem to grow more serious by the day . <p> Last week , the Securities and Exchange Commission said it had upgraded its inquiry into the backdating of stock options at Take-Two from an informal probe to a full-fledged investigation . Separately , the Manhattan district attorney and the Internal Revenue Service are conducting their own investigations of the company . <p> Whether Take-Two is salvageable , technology analysts said , depends on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fresh management and a new corporate culture ? Or are its problems too systemic and ingrained to repair ? <p> " Will it be easy ? No , " said Daniel Ernst , an analyst with Soleil Securities in New York . " They 've got one phenomenally well-known franchise , and a decent position in the market from which to grow that . So I think there 's a decent opportunity here . " <p> While Take-Two has never had trouble selling its notoriously violent Grand Theft Auto series , which will go on sale in its fourth incarnation in October , other games have not done as well . <p> That means that a single game in the Grand Theft Auto series has at times made up more than half of the company 's sales , even though it has dozens of titles . For example , for the first three months after the newest Grand Theft Auto game went on sale in 2004 , it accounted for 57 percent of Take-Two 's total sales of $502 million for that period , according to Janco Partners , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose steadily for much of March , after it became known that shareholders were plotting a revolt . The stock peaked at $23.79 before falling back , closing yesterday at $20.38 . <p> So what does a former movie executive turned music executive turned investor know about turning around a video-game business ? Some of Mr. Zelnick 's new employees are asking that very question . <p> In his new role as chairman , Mr. Zelnick has held town hall meetings with Take-Two 's staff . At one of those meetings in the company 's Los Angeles office , an employee asked Mr. Zelnick whether he understood the types of games Take-Two makes . <p> That kind of candor does not rattle Mr. Zelnick . " There 's no consequence for saying what 's on your mind , negative or positive , " he said . If there are aspects of Take-Two 's business that he does not fully understand , Mr. Zelnick said he is comfortable delegating authority . <p> " What I do in a situation where I 'm uncomfortable because I do n't have knowledge or experience is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After he stepped down as the head of 20th Century Fox in 1993  --  a position he had held for four years , starting at the precocious age of 32  --  Mr. Zelnick became chief executive of Crystal Dynamics , a video game start-up . But he left after a little more than a year to become president and chief executive of BMG Entertainment 's North American division in 1994 . <p> Part of his success there was in reducing costs . He cut jobs at money-losing labels , and at the company 's faltering record club he doubled profits within a year . <p> He said he planned to take a similarly active approach to Take-Two . He has already ordered up business plans from all Take-Two division heads . On Monday , the chief financial officer , Karl H. Winters , resigned ; he was a holdover from the tenure of Take-Two 's ousted chief executive , Paul Eibeler . <p> Within 100 days , Mr. Zelnick said he hoped to have a permanent chief executive in place  --  Benjamin Feder , a ZelnickMedia partner , is currently filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors . <p> Analysts said Take-Two 's problems were not necessarily insurmountable . " They have arguably the best video game in the industry , " said Mike Hickey , an analyst with Janco . " Yet they have an interesting dislocation between incredible product and operating performance . <p> " When you see that dislocation , normally you 'd find that attributable to management . With some fresh eyes , I think they could have a definite benefit . " <p> Mr. Zelnick formed ZelnickMedia with three partners in 2001 after leaving BMG , in part because he disagreed with its parent company about entering into an agreement with the file-sharing service Napster . There he had success with other corporate overhauls . <p> One of its first big projects , the publisher Time-Life , was losing money when ZelnickMedia bought the rights to market Time-Life products in 2003 . The firm said it paid a " very low " price for the marketing rights . The firm sold a profitable Time-Life to Reader 's Digest last month for $91.8 million . <p> On the other hand , another ZelnickMedia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing money when the firm sold it last year . Of course , Time-Life , known for its commemorative photo albums and music compilations , and Lillian Vernon , a seller of needlepoint pillows and rattan baskets , are quite different from a video-game company that likes to push the boundaries , as Mr. Zelnick acknowledges . <p> " Take-Two is bigger , and in certain ways more complex , " he said . " On the other hand , Take-Two has no debt . It has a material amount of cash . " <p> He added , " And the No. 1 franchise in the video-game business . " ##
