Roughly 25,000 years ago , in a series of deep caves in Spain and France , a number of forever nameless Cro-Magnon geniuses gave us our first works of art . Working by lamplight in otherwise total darkness , they produced images so breathtaking that for many years after their discovery in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , many paleontologists thought they were modern fakes . And what was the first thing that man chose to depict at the very dawn of civilization ? It was hunting . Wild bulls , bears , reindeer , and all the other creatures upon which early man depended were rendered in colors that are still vibrant today . The question is , why ? What compelled them to do this ? One theory holds that the paintings were a form of magic . The Cro-Magnons might have believed that if you could capture an animal 's image , you could control the actual animal and thereby make your struggle for survival a little less desperate . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunt is still hardwired into us , and it is from this ancient urge that the covers you see here derive their visceral power . Is there anyone reading this who has not looked at a monster-buck cover and imagined himself putting the crosshairs on that animal ? Or looked at a snarling grizzly cover and not felt the hair on his neck rise just a little ? What was magic to the Cro-Magnons is still magic to us . Waterfowl Nation It is a sport that has changed hugely in 110 years , but there is still nothing like it . It is part chess match and part art form  --  your wits and patience and capacity for suffering against the speed and gimlet eyes of ducks and geese . Once , it looked like there might be no more ducks . For years , you shot as many as you liked , as witnessed by the November 1902 cover . Today , a hunter with that many ducks in his possession would be sent to prison , probably without benefit of a trial . It is worth remembering that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ray Holland helped sell the public on the idea that there was a limit to how many ducks you could shoot if there were to be any ducks in the future . The November 1909 cover is something else altogether . It looks as if it should have been the cover of Popular Science rather than F &S; and is explainable by the fact that the Wright brothers had made the first heavier-than-air flight only six years previously . Sportsmen were enraptured with the possibilities . This was not a passing fad . Post-World War II issues of F &S; were obsessed with the idea that everyone would soon fly everywhere to hunt and fish for everything . Flush Years Until the 1970s , there was a heavy New England cast to the editorial staff of F &S.; Publishers , editors-in-chief , and their minions were far more at home in old apple orchards and alder thickets than dove fields , and that is why most of our earlier bird hunting covers tended toward grouse , woodcock , and turkeys ( but please , not Merriam 's turkeys ) . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most solitary and the most social . A day in the alders with just a dog is infinitely satisfying ( August 1910 ) , but the best hunts are shared hunts , which is shown to perfection by the imaginative cover of September 1962 . The floating feathers and the expression on the boy 's face say it all . It is his first bird , and he 'll remember it when he is an old man . Armchair Adventures F &S's; " mortal peril " covers differed from the lurid men 's pulp magazine covers of the 1920s to the 1950s in that the stories on which they were based were probably true  --  or at least partly so . Professional writers wrote some of them , but most came from people who had been to the edge , returned alive , and put it down on paper . You see their names once , and they do not appear again . ( We were not so concerned in those days with polished prose as with hair-raising yarns . ) Remember when you peruse these old covers that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of difficult travel simply to get to where you would be hunting , and there were no radios , no satellite phones , no air rescues , no GPS units , and no miracles of modern emergency medicine . It was just you , whatever skill and courage you had , and the wilder-ness , which did not care if you lived or died . The best of these covers  --  certainly the subtlest  --  is February 1913 . The artist managed to convey the bitter cold , the utter silence , and the short hours of daylight in the subarctic in a way that is filled with menace . This guy is alone ; if he gets into trouble , no one can help him get out of it . You are tempted to look for a wolf pack lurking in the pines in the lower right-hand corner , but they are more effective if they are in your imagination . Killer Cats If bears are menace personified , cats are mystery itself , solitary , unknowable , and lethal . The mystery is best captured by the beautiful cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden by tree branches . It is not leaping through the air or snarling  --  it is actually quite serene  --  but it is a wonderful glimpse of one of the rarest of wild cats . Our attitude toward the big cats has changed . Once they were grist for the mills of writers who saw them all as man-eaters or man-eaters in waiting . Protection was scant ; an Indian prince who fancied the sport could kill hundreds of tigers in his lifetime . Now , we see the big cats as creatures whose time has probably passed , and who will be seen by future generations only through the bars of a zoo . Best Friends As covers , they are not particularly imaginative . The artists seemed content to paint an obvious scene with no subtleties and no message . So devoted were readers to their dogs that they did n't need anything else . A pair of setters , one pointing , one honoring , painted by that magician of the paintbrush Lynn Bogue Hunt ( October 1903 ) , was enough for anyone . The exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A raccoon glowers not at the dog , but straight at the reader . The hound , instead of looking panicked or enraged , looks philosophical . I knew if I kept chasing these animals something like this was going to happen . The cover line says " Killer Coon , " and you can believe it . This is a sinister animal with a cold intelligence . And it will probably come for you after it is done with your dog . The magazine 's choice of breeds did not run to the exotic . We ran what our readers owned  --  beagles , pointers , setters , Labs , and the occasional cocker spaniel . Weimaraners , vizslas , and pudelpointers were beyond the comprehension of everyone , including the editors . Big Bad Bears Prehistoric men probably venerated bears and were certainly scared to death of them , and this attitude lasted right into the 20th century . Witness the cover of October 1911 , which depicts a slavering grizzly menacing a cowboy who is unlimbering to shoot the bruin , or the July 1927 cover , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt mistaken him for an off-brand seal . But we became more enlightened and less afraid , and by June 1955 F &S; could commission covers that depicted bears as nuisances or as downright cute ( December 1958 ) . Still , even with the passage of time , there is an unspoken message to our visions of bears : They ate our grandfathers many generations removed , and they will be pleased to do the same for us . Magazine Racks Whitetail deer are The Franchise now , but there were many years when it was not so , simply because there were practically no deer . There are many men and women still living who can remember when the sighting of a deer track was the cause of conversation for weeks . We have come a long way indeed  --  or more properly , the deer have . There is a theme that runs through these covers , moving from December 1908 through January 1912 , September 1929 , and December 1954 , and it deals with a fundamental fact of whitetail hunting  --  the big bastards always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we also know that C.E. Monroe Jr . ' s hunter will retrieve the antler tip and take it back to camp , where he will have his shirttail cut off to accompanying hoots and jeers .
