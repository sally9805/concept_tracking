Section : CAPSTONE ESSAY <p> After the Indian Ocean tsunami of 26 December 2004 donor countries subscribed to post-disaster relief appeals so copiously that all the money could not be spent quickly enough to justify the reasons for which it was donated . For other contemporary disasters , particularly in sub-Saharan Africa , there was an alarming dearth of funds and a general failure to respond to international relief appeals . This paradox neither illustrates that the world is becoming more generous nor demonstrates the opposite . It does , however , highlight one of the many contrasts inherent in current approaches to disaster . As worldwide involvement in the relief and mitigation of catastrophe deepens and becomes more complex , so the approach becomes more fragmentary in some respects , particularly those that relate to global security strategies , and more uniform in others , especially in terms of where the international political system directs its limited attention . <p> Over the last half-century the massive growth of worldwide travel and telecommunications has brought what were once essentially regional and local problems onto the world stage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global pattern of catastrophes and offers an analysis of modern systems of emergency preparedness and processes of disaster relief , with particular attention to the problems of creating resilience and the moral and practical dilemmas of prevention and response . First it examines the global impact of disasters with respect to changes in societal vulnerability and growing imbalances in economic development . Next , it considers mass communications in relation to the symbolic significance of disasters and the patterns of donation to relief appeals . It then looks critically at the logistical and organizational aspects of humanitarian relief , with particular attention to major events , such as the Atlantic hurricanes of September 2005 and South Asia earthquake of October 2005 , and what they reveal about the international community 's policies and practices regarding aid . Subsequently . the article considers disaster mitigation in relation to world economic trends and the changing structure of global financial power . It then examines the current international policy frameworks for catastrophe mitigation and the prospects for achieving positive change in the future . THE GLOBALIZATION OF MODERN DISASTERS <p> In physical terms global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , as periodic mass extinctions have resulted from the " global winter " caused by gigantic volcanic eruptions or the impact of large extraterrestrial bodies . But because the geological timescale on which such events occur is so much longer than the one on which human lives are measured , these events are too rare to fall under the remit of an article about the globalization of disaster. ( n1 ) Moreover , it has taken the better part of two and a half millennia to appreciate the significance of major cataclysmic natural events . First , the form of the earth as a celestial globe had to be understood ; second , the laws of modern physics had to be established , especially regarding the force of gravity ; third , the age of the Earth had to be rolled back far enough to permit some understanding of the magnitude and frequency of exceptional events ; and finally a robust geophysical explanation of seismicity , volcanism and the general circulation had to be worked out . Hence a proper understanding of the physical underpinnings of natural disaster only emerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed immeasurably to worldwide consciousness of major natural disasters , but much less to understanding of the key problem of vulnerability , which some scholars regard as a far greater determinant of disaster risk than the existence of hazards themselves. ( n3 ) <p> In terms of human perception , prior to the 20th century the event closest to a global disaster was probably the Portuguese earthquake of 1755 . Tsunami waves reached the shores of North America and the Caribbean . At the same time , the destruction of Lisbon , the power center of a thriving commercial empire , by earthquake , fire and tsunami and the violent death of 60,000 of its inhabitants sent shock waves through the intelligentsia of Europe and abruptly threw the Enlightenment into a darker phase of pessimism and foreboding. ( n4 ) Yet although it was a significant marker in the history of Western thought , the Lisbon earthquake can hardly be regarded as a " global " disaster : It had no discernable effect on Asia. ( n5 ) Another major event of this period in Europe was the 1783 eruption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from famine , as there was then no international relief system to come to the rescue  --  indeed , there was hardly any mechanism for the rapid transmission of news from one country to another. ( n6 ) <p> In terms of the impact of logistical technology , the ability to travel and communicate rapidly over long distances , there are no parallels with the modern era . Yet the Baroque period ( roughly 1650-1750 ) offers some interesting analogies to the current epoch . Both are characterized by the tension of opposites , which has acted as a stimulus to intellectual and technological development. ( n7 ) Both are distinguished by the polarization of wealth and , as a result , by social unrest . In the modern age absolutism may have disappeared  --  in most places  --  but oligarchies have largely replaced it. ( n8 ) Global power may have taken on a different form , but it is as highly structured as it was in the 18th century . <p> We tend to regard the modern world as being dominated by technology : the ability to fly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and receive news by satellite in real time from anywhere in the world . However , we would do well to remember that a large proportion of the world 's population is still excluded from the benefits of science . It is estimated that half the population has never used a telephone . One-fifth has no access to electricity . The average value of a family home worldwide is only about one thousand dollars , while conversely the 360 wealthiest men and women control half of the world 's monetary resources. ( n9 ) This is the " democratic absolutism " of the new Baroque era , and we should beware of generalizations that are expected to cover a world that is as deeply divided now as it was in the 18th century. ( n10 ) <p> These reflections suggest that the globalization of disasters is not an entirely new phenomenon , or at least that it has antique roots. ( n11 ) However , over the last half-century it has acquired a particular significance in terms of various facets , which can be summarized as follows : <p> ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass ownership of receiving devices have enabled graphic descriptions and images of human suffering in disasters to be disseminated throughout the world with minimal delay . This has engendered the sense of participating in disaster and has greatly increased the common stock of knowledge of catastrophic events . Moreover , it is much more difficult than in the past for disasters in remote places to go unobserved and unrecorded . <p> ( b ) Along with mass communications , rapid global travel has enabled the international community to respond quickly and  --  at least in theory  --  effectively to disasters when they occur . The existence of an apparatus capable of mounting the required responses is a function of the growth of the world relief system , in large measure represented by the UN system , the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and major non-governmental organizations such as Oxfam. ( n12 ) <p> ( c ) The first half of the 20th century saw the globalization of conflict , while the second half was marked by the transformation of this into regional and national proxy wars influenced by the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " complex emergencies " characterized by political , military ; social and economic breakdown . Although the phenomenon is age-old , the full recognition of complex emergencies for what they are had to wait until the 1990s , a period of confusion in international relations and growing moral crisis in humanitarian assistance. ( n13 ) Scorched earth tactics and total war have their antecedents in classical times , if not earlier . They emerged as a modern phenomenon in the Iberian campaigns of Napoleon in the first decade of the 1800s , but the ingenuity and ruthlessness with which they have been employed in modern times is unprecedented in history. ( n14 ) This has both exacerbated natural catastrophes and created disasters in their own right . The twenty-five complex emergencies that exist in the world in the mid-2000s are all regional disasters of global significance to the international community. ( n15 ) <p> ( d ) The occurrence of conflict and exercise of power have increased global vulnerability to disasters and the international community has sought to respond to this by developing strategies of disaster reduction . These have increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only secure means of providing the resources to create and maintain resilience against the effects of calamity at the local level . How this is to be achieved , what " sustainable disaster reduction " means and why it has not enjoyed more success have been the subject of vigorous debate among development specialists and diplomats. ( n16 ) <p> These trends have complex implications and ramifications , not least because they are interconnected . Hence , the following sections will subject them to a critical analysis in order to reveal some of the subtleties and paradoxes that they engender . As a preliminary step , it is opportune to summarize the current state of the world with regard to disasters . A DANGEROUS WORLD <p> Averages have little meaning in disaster statistics. ( n17 ) Annual death tolls in calamity appeared to have fallen from a mean of 140,000 in the late 1980s to one of 59,000 by 2003 , but the Indian Ocean tsunami of 26 December 2004 , which affected twelve countries over a vast area of the Indian Ocean basin , killed at least 231,450 people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent to the running mean for the previous five years. ( n18 ) Despite this anomaly , in the short term it seems reasonable to suppose that the UN International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction ( IDNDR , 1990-2000 ) went some way towards achieving its aims by holding the line on disaster mortality. ( n19 ) However , we should always bear in mind the very high potential mortality in a wide variety of possible events , such as pandemics , major volcanic eruptions , high-magnitude earthquakes or widespread radioactive contamination. ( n20 ) The principal risks can be divided into those that threaten life directly , such as floods and earthquakes , and those that threaten living conditions through their potential effect on the environment , such as soil erosion and landslides , or on the food chain , such as epizootics and epiphytotics. ( n21 ) In both cases it is difficult to predict future mortality , as changes in society , demography and development continually alter vulnerability , while hazards include both rare events that are not frequent enough to provide clear trends and climate changes whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Despite the problems associated with estimating trends , insurance statistics reveal a fifteen- or sixteen-fold increase since 1950 in the impact of disasters as measured in terms of death tolls , monetary losses and numbers of people displaced . Notwithstanding the irregularity of global statistics of mortality , morbidity , the value of damage and the number of people affected , there is a clear trend towards ever greater impacts in the future. ( n23 ) The three main explanations of this trend are the growth of population and vulnerability in zones of high hazard , particularly to natural disasters ; increasing technological vulnerability to disasters ; and more thorough and detailed reporting of calamity wherever it occurs , leading to more comprehensive accounting. ( n24 ) However , when projected beyond about 2020 , the trend in disaster statistics tends towards the vertical  --  i.e. , infinite death tolls and costs  --  which is clearly absurd , and hence the statistics should be taken cum grano salis. ( n25 ) In a recent book , Alan Kirschenbaum argued that the huge rise in the impact of disasters coincided with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dramatize the situations they deal with in order to seem important . This , he suggested , has led to the reclassification of mere incidents as full-fledged disasters. ( n26 ) Though most analysts in this field would be skeptical of Kirschenbaum 's theory ; it contains enough residual truth to be worthy of profound meditation . <p> Whether or not the impacts of disaster have been exaggerated , there is no doubt about the potential for further deterioration if something is not done to improve global resilience . Worldwide over the last half-century wealth differentials have almost tripled . At the same time there have been more than 150 armed conflicts , all of which have set back the processes of economic development and the acquisition of resilience against disaster. ( n27 ) In the main hazard areas population continues to rise generally faster than protection measures can be devised and implemented. ( n28 ) In the future global warming may increase the severity of storms , the extent of land affected and the levels of coastal inundation . Moreover , the relationship between kinetic energy expenditure in storms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases in wind pressure cause large increases in damage ) , to the detriment of safety and security. ( n29 ) Finally , the relentless accumulation of fixed capital and investment in hazard zones constantly increases the value of losses . Multibillion-dollar disasters are now common and trillion-dollar losses are hypothesized for future events. ( n30 ) <p> Vulnerability has been defined authoritatively as " the conditions determined by physical , social , economic , and environmental factors or processes , which increase the susceptibility of a community to the impact of hazards . " ( n31 ) Notwithstanding a century of remarkable advances in geophysics and seismic engineering , many people still live in the world 's most hazardous places in a state of undefended , rudimentary vulnerability that seems not to be reduced by the lessons of events. ( n32 ) For example , in Kerman province , Iran , a devastating earthquake occurs on average once every 8.7 years ; in Afghanistan the recurrence interval of such disasters is a mere 2.4 years , and they are interspersed with lethal floods , avalanches and landslides. ( n33 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibiting minimal resilience . For example , there is no discernable trend in recent years towards reduction in the death tolls caused by natural disasters , particularly earthquakes , landslides and floods , in the Hindu Kush and Northwest Frontier regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan . On the other side of the Himalayan chain , despite widespread recognition of the importance of reinforcing critical facilities against destruction in disasters , the South Asia earthquake of 8 October 2005 destroyed 10,000 schools and annihilated 17,000 of their pupils. ( n34 ) Like hospitals , schools are undoubtedly critical facilities by any definition of the term. ( n35 ) As the level of seismic retrofitting after previous earthquakes was negligible , evidently the " window of opportunity , " a well-known mechanism of change in the richer countries , does not necessarily swing open when the earth has stopped shaking in the Hindu Kush or the Zagros Mountains  --  nor does it anywhere else unless the political conditions are favorable. ( n36 ) It did not swing open either for the 120,000 people who were left stranded in New Orleans at the arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no alternative evacuation transport was provided for them . In this sense the political process was both discriminatory and negligent of risks . In synthesis , one might conclude that globalization is a very relative phenomenon. ( n37 ) <p> Yet even the people who were left behind , abandoned by the forces that were supposed to save them , were under the intense scrutiny of the mass media . In this sense disasters have been democratized : However fickle and inconsistent it may be , media attention brings instant news of events whether they occur in the United States or the remoter parts of the Himalayas . The practical and symbolic roles of mass communication will be analyzed in detail in the next section . MASS COMMUNICATIONS <p> Satellite technology enables people to determine their exact position , obtain precise images of visible changes in the earth 's surface and send graphic , audible or written information instantly from almost anywhere in the world . Along with the rise of wireless broadcasting , it has contributed to the diffusion of a global consciousness. ( n38 ) <p> Global communications have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always had enormous symbolic significance , and , although its interpretation has changed over the centuries , the symbolism is no less potent in the modern world than it was in the past. ( n39 ) For example , in some traditional cultures disasters have been interpreted commonly in terms of divine retribution , portents or indicators of almighty will. ( n40 ) Increasingly , for those whose only involvement is as spectators in the electronic pageant of disaster , it is significant mainly as spectacle , or for those of a strong moral and religious persuasion , also as parable. ( n41 ) <p> Academic studies of journalism have long cast aspersions on journalists ' perceptions of disaster as revealed by their writing or broadcasting. ( n42 ) As a rule , and despite the massive growth in global awareness , the further from home a disaster occurs , the less likely it is to be understood by those who are reporting on it. ( n43 ) Moreover , very few journalists have any specific expertise in disasters ; more , perhaps , have experience in war reporting . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an even greater iconic status than previously . The sound bite and film clip , replayed endlessly for the duration of the short-term aftermath , have come to represent the event itself in a form of symbolism that often has little objective relation to the reality on the ground. ( n44 ) <p> Paradoxically , the globalization of information on disasters has not dispelled the myths , or common misassumptions , about them . If anything , these have been propagated by the global mass media . There are about twenty-five common misconceptions. ( n45 ) They include belief in the ability of unburied dead bodies to cause disease epidemics among disaster survivors , and belief in the prevalence of panic and irrational behavior in groups of people who experience emergency situations . News media tend to propagate such ideas as ostensible evidence of the latent savagery of human beings and of the fragility of civilized society , which in situations of stress supposedly threatens to break down under the influence of destructive and competitive behavior by its members. ( n46 ) In reality , society is extraordinarily resilient  --  people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalists allow them credit for  --  and no matter how much destruction occurs , single catastrophic events do not annihilate social bonds. ( n47 ) Studies show that even many experts believe the myths , as disaster managers are television viewers and newspaper readers like any other members of the public. ( n48 ) <p> There is a complex set of linkages between the mass media and their constituencies among the general public . News media both create and reflect  --  or profit from  --  contemporary mores. ( n49 ) The public 's attention to the problem of disasters is seldom very sustained and neither is that of the news media . Publicity , or the lack of it , can turn donations to a relief appeal on and off like a tap . In many cases charitable donations are given more on the basis of publicity , and the sense of immediacy lent by the graphic portrayal of current events , than on the basis of actual need. ( n50 ) Thus , donations to the relief appeal after the Indian Ocean tsunami built up exceptional surpluses of funds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United Nations to tackle a developing famine in sub-Saharan Africa essentially failed for lack of subscription. ( n51 ) News about the famine was greatly overshadowed by reporting of the tsunami and its aftermath . Moreover , among the victims of the latter were many European and North American tourists who were vacationing on the coasts overrun by the waves , which gave the tsunami an immediacy that its geographical remoteness from the main sources of donation would not otherwise have engendered . <p> The year 2005 was an exceptional one for disasters , as it included several major hurricanes , the earthquake in South Asia and the aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami of 26 December 2004 . In China alone 2,500 people were killed and nearly 16 million left homeless by natural disasters. ( n52 ) Few years have so clearly emphasized the distinction between well-publicized major events with well-subscribed relief appeals and quiet but profound suffering in parts of the world where the mass media have not shown great interest and relief appeals have not born fruit. ( n53 ) People in the richer countries can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . The global pattern of disasters is irregular and when there are too many events to deal with , the givers tend to suffer from attention deficit and " donor fatigue . " ( n54 ) This reveals the ad hoc nature of global disaster response , which is neither rigorously pursued nor consistently funded . <p> The sense that donations to relief appeals are not solving the disasters problem is not an entirely unjustified one . When disaster strikes it is , of course , necessary to provide money and resources to ensure that survivors have the opportunity to rebuild their lives and hopefully to increase their resilience given the risk of future disasters . In some respects the immediate post-disaster period , with its high probability of obtaining a political consensus on the need for better mitigation , is the right moment to introduce mitigation . However , most practical mitigation strategies require more time , resources and persistence than can be meted out during the post-disaster window of opportunity . <p> Sociologists have long held that disasters create their own cultures and subcultures. ( n55 ) Anthropologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local level. ( n56 ) Nevertheless , few comparative studies of culture and disaster have been conducted , in part because of the problems of defining culture , which is a multifaceted concept that is difficult to quantify. ( n57 ) By and large , national cultures have not adapted well to disaster ; such is the ponderousness of national administrative mechanisms . Regional cultures have done better in many cases , notably in Europe and the Caribbean , cooperating with regions in other countries in creating mitigation programs . Whether a global culture of disaster prevention can be achieved is a moot point. ( n58 ) The link between disaster reduction and economic development , obvious for very many years , only became a common topic of international debate in the 1990s , after decades in which development was simply halted , or set back , while the aftermaths of large disasters were addressed. ( n59 ) <p> The next two sections of this paper will consider aspects of disaster reduction related to economic development in terms of the power structures that control funding and the development of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In Rio de Janeiro in 1992 , at the inauguration of the World Conference of Environment and Development , the principal donor countries pledged to spend 0.7 percent of their monetary wealth on international development. ( n60 ) Very few of them have ever come close to that figure , as the values over the years have averaged between 0.15 and 0.35 percent. ( n61 ) The Rio promise was made at a time when the fall of the Berlin Wall and retreat from military confrontation seemed to promise a " peace dividend " which could be spent on such projects . It was replaced within three years by fiscal and economic stringency . Nevertheless , it is necessary as well to remember that 87 percent of international monetary transactions are purely speculative. ( n62 ) The financial community has shown little conscience in repudiating the proposal for a 0.25 percent tax on international capital transfers in favor of economic development . When in 1998 Hurricane Mitch set back development processes in parts of Nicaragua and Honduras by , according to some commentators , as much as twenty years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , met in Washington , DC to allocate one-hundredth as much money to disaster relief as they were prepared to pay out to cushion the stock markets against the impact of excessive speculative investment . Moreover , nations often donate cash to disaster relief appeals on the assumption that the use of their own materials , consultants and contractors will cause the money to flow back to its country of origin , sometimes by as much as 70 percent. ( n63 ) <p> Nevertheless , there may well be promising developments in the future . The emergence of China as a possible superpower is set to change the world 's economic landscape quite radically . It has already benefited some of the poorer countries by raising commodity prices . However , whether or not poor nations that suffer repeated disasters can escape from setbacks to economic development in their aftermath depends on a combination of wealth generation , good governance and freedom from adverse foreign intervention in political and economic affairs . The international community has been vociferous in calling for improved governance , but the leading economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not conducive to the sort of political autonomy required for good governance to thrive. ( n64 ) <p> It would not be far from the truth to argue that the most globalized commodity of all is money As it flows around the world  --  around the lucrosphere  --  it concentrates in the hands of an international elite. ( n65 ) At least for the time being , neoliberalism has seen a massive transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich , and hence an increasing marginalization of the former , which is panoramically visible in the barrios , favelas and bidonvilles of major cities in developing countries. ( n66 ) As human capital has low value , large-scale loss of life is not enough to stimulate great changes in disaster mitigation. ( n67 ) If , however , a major disaster were seriously to undermine the stability of the world 's system of financial markets , then such a change would probably take place . <p> It is an open question as to what sort of event could stimulate the reorientation needed to get the disasters problem back under control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that potential . In fact , death tolls of more than a million and a half have been hypothesized for the maximum expected event in Tehran or Istanbul , but once again mass mortality alone is not likely to cause the necessary revolution by stirring the world 's conscience and stimulating an answer to the vulnerability problem that is both creative and concerted. ( n68 ) Very large-scale contamination , perhaps from a volcanic eruption or a huge radiation leak , could be sufficient . Although less likely , the impact or threatened arrival of a large extraterrestrial body would certainly stimulate rather more than a run-of-the-mill response . Finally , a pandemic would require organization of a different order of magnitude from that which currently prevails , as it would seriously affect basic services and economic production , assuming that it occurred on the same scale as the 1918 influenza pandemic. ( n69 ) <p> Having considered the underpinnings of global disaster relief in terms of power structures , a review of the system of providing international aid itself is now in order . GLOBAL LOGISTICS AND THE HUMANITARIAN AID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first disaster in which television pictures of acute suffering and the effects of starvation were transmitted around the world. ( n70 ) The international community 's reaction , coupled with the growing organization of the United Nations in the field of emergency relief , led gradually to the formulation of a global approach to disaster management . However , it could be argued that globalized disaster relief has been achieved more by trial and error than by the application of theory and experience. ( n71 ) <p> Disaster is always a local problem , and an axiomatic principle is that the remedy in terms of protection and relief must be applied at the grassroots level of local communities and administrations. ( n72 ) Large catastrophes therefore tend to be aggregations of local disasters . Because tragedy is replicated in so many places , resources for mitigation and relief tend to be scarce enough to be subject to vigorous competition. ( n73 ) Through the work of the UN 's IDNDR and its continuation , the UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction ( ISDR ) , the world community has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economic and human development . The recognition is embodied in the Hyogo Protocol of 2005 , which states the principles for formulating national policies for disaster risk reduction and is a working document designed to constitute the basis for such policy. ( n74 ) The challenge now is not so much one of coordinating the aid that is distributed to many disparate communities , but of enabling them to achieve resilience autonomously . This requires helping the communities to make the transition from post-disaster relief to pre-disaster risk reduction . <p> Under the Clinton administration , the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) adopted an explicit strategy of endeavoring to shift emphasis from reaction to disasters to prevention of their worst effects . Nevertheless , at the end of the 1990s two-thirds ( $2.3 billion ) of FEMA 's budget was expended on immediate post-disaster assistance . Subsequently , the Bush administration quietly dropped FEMA 's Project Impact , which aimed to disseminate good practice in terms of cooperative mitigation activities at the community level. ( n75 ) This emphasis is replicated in most , if not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that , despite years of debate on development theory , the world humanitarian network is still strongly reactive and not prescriptive with respect to how it tackles disaster risk. ( n76 ) <p> Although a worldwide relief system does exist , it is probable that , as noted above , a truly global response to the catastrophe problem requires a stronger basis of local and regional preparedness , which will require effort on the part of all players , from local communities to national governments and international organizations. ( n77 ) Local communities and municipal authorities are the front line in the battle against disasters , with support , coordination and harmonization provided by regional authorities . In this respect , shockwaves were felt throughout the world of disaster management at the failure to manage adequately the response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in the southern United States . The effects of Hurricane Katrina were accurately predicted by analyses of the near-miss Hurricane Ivan that occurred almost one year earlier. ( n78 ) When disaster finally struck , municipal , county and state-level preparedness proved to be woefully inadequate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster waiting to happen . Federal backup was a fiasco , initially dominated by a knee-jerk reaction based , after four years of counterterrorism preparedness , on the wrong type of disaster . Suddenly the United States found itself accepting aid from a list of countries that included Sri Lanka , still in the throes of recovering from the December 2004 tsunami , and Bangladesh , one of the world 's poorest and most disaster-prone countries . Carnival seemed to have broken out in the Deep South : The emperor became servant and the servant was nominated emperor . <p> This curiously anomalous situation demonstrates that the key to disaster risk reduction is local self-sufficiency . If necessary it can be achieved by setting up twinning arrangements between relief organizations abroad and in the affected local communities and by transferring technology and expertise to where they are needed . Insofar as the global relief system is based on the principle of immediate international intervention , it is manifestly insufficient . For example , after the Iranian earthquake of 26 December 2003 some 1,600 foreign rescuers arrived in the city of Bam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As none of the rescuers reached the area during the critical six to eight hours after the earthquake when urban search and rescue ( SAR ) are at a premium , they pulled out only thirty people alive from the rubble . In this respect it resembled most of the other major international earthquake disasters in the last few decades . The cost of such interventions averages around one million dollars per life saved . If they were conducted by local SAR teams it could be reduced to fifty cents per life saved , and many logistical and communications problems could be avoided. ( n79 ) <p> Having considered immediate relief , the discussion will now focus on post-disaster reconstruction , the other end of the disaster management process . THE LAST PHASE OF THE " DISASTER CYCLE " : RECONSTRUCTION <p> Paradoxically , although recovery and reconstruction are of great interest to the world community , they are essentially local , not global , issues. ( n80 ) Grassroots support and participation are essential to the success of reconstruction projects . Most cases in which governments , foreign donors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recovery from disasters have led to failure  --  or at least underperformance  --  and dissatisfaction on the part of the beneficiaries , who are usually survivors and other local people . As a corollary , a balance must be struck between imported and indigenous sources of knowledge , favoring the latter when it is able to produce good results without compromising safety and equity. ( n81 ) <p> One example of the ill-fated combination of paternalism and insensitive use of imported knowledge was the Flood Action Plan for Bangladesh , as originally formulated in 1985 with the aid of French consultants . It called for the canalization of the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers , a project that would have cost $10 billion and would have had catastrophic results , first , by restricting the supply of water to rice paddies ; second , by ponding floodwater when overbank spillage occurred ; and third , by failing to resist the hydraulic and seismic forces that would quickly have dismantled the levees . Fortunately , the plan was rewritten as twenty-nine different local sub-projects and local communities were consulted. ( n82 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been demolished by the barrage of criticism from genuine experts , in the subsequent projects the conservatism of district administrators mitigated against both involving local people and adopting innovative solutions. ( n83 ) <p> In many cases , those engaged in reconstruction have had to grapple with the problem of how to avoid recreating the vulnerability that led to the disaster in the first place . The favelas of Rio de Janeiro and barrios of Caracas  --  indeed the slums of any major city  --  should not be allowed to recolonize unstable slopes , floodable canyons or toxically poisoned land. ( n84 ) If such a fate is to be avoided , more attractive and secure land must be provided for community development . Moreover , the process of reconstruction requires patient , long-term work to involve local communities . It also needs impartiality and the ability to listen to local perspectives . Unfortunately , the international community 's attention span is limited . Sometimes the perspective is determined by the news media , which soon move on to the next event , while even the international relief agencies can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparking new demands for aid and relief . Perhaps this is one reason why reconstruction is a slow process after most disasters , and funds are usually quite inadequate . Conflict and lack of security are other reasons . Finally , not all donors honor their pledges , though in the case of the Indian Ocean tsunami , widespread discussion of this fact led donors to substantiate at least 80 percent of their pledges with hard cash. ( n85 ) <p> In synthesis , there are few technical reasons why reconstruction after disaster should not create a safer , more secure environment for community life . Sometimes this happens , as with the diffusion of simple , cheap , anti-seismic family dwellings in Maharashtra state , India , after the 1993 earthquake there. ( n86 ) When it does not happen , and vulnerability is replicated in the reconstruction projects , the explanations tend to be political or economic . In fact , failure to relaunch the economy of an area affected by calamity could lead to a delayed disaster  --  in terms of stagnation and unemployment  --  two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phuket , a province and city in Thailand affected by the 2004 tsunami , 70 percent of revenues from tourism have left the area . In order to counteract this state of affairs , stronger local institutions are needed , but as usual the centrist tendencies of the national government mitigate against keeping revenues in the local area. ( n87 ) In the worst cases , such as in Aceh province in Indonesia or the Tamil north of Sri Lanka , the situation may descend or relapse into open conflict , which is highly detrimental to any reconstruction plan , whether national or local. ( n88 ) <p> Having considered diverse aspects of disaster management , it is appropriate to draw back and look at the wider question of global  --  and local  --  security . SECURITY AND DISASTER MANAGEMENT <p> In reality , the term " security "  --  a modern obsession  --  has many interpretations . International security has been a major preoccupation of states in the past half-century and has mainly been about conflict reduction , rather than , for example , environmental security or natural disaster reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because conflict has successfully been reduced , but because global climate change may alter the balance towards natural hazards , especially if it results in the formation of " super-hurricanes " and much greater depths and geographical scales of flooding . This will affect many aspects of security , including household security , employment and economic security , and possibly even national strategic security if the balance of resource consumption is affected. ( n89 ) <p> The balance between terrorist acts and disasters that do not entail the deliberate use of force or violence begs the question of what form of organization of society is needed to ensure greater security. ( n90 ) In modern disaster preparedness one can distinguish between civil defense , or " homeland security " as it has more recently become known , and civil protection , also termed " civil contingencies management " and " resilience . " Modern civil defense began in the 1930s as a spontaneous attempt to organize civilian populations against the effects of aerial bombardment , for example , in 1937 at Guernica during the Spanish Civil War . This role became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed during the Cold War to that of readying civilians for a thermonuclear exchange . <p> In response to the demonstrable futility of preparations for nuclear war , increases in dtente and the pressing need to manage natural disaster impacts efficiently resulted in civil protection , involving a more democratic , community-based form of organization , gradually eclipsing defense . However , in the 2000s the rising threat of international terrorism has led to a resurgence of civil defense in a new guise. ( n91 ) <p> As a result , in many countries the two systems are developing in a state of uneasy coexistence . For example , the U.S. federal government 's first reaction to Hurricane Katrina was rigidly to follow standard procedures and send materials more appropriate for a terrorist attack than a major storm . Commentators have suggested that the response to major flooding in New Orleans would have been more efficient if a terrorist had blown up one of the levees , rather than the levees being breached by natural forces. ( n92 ) This illustrates the danger of concentrating on new and emerging risks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . <p> According to the simplest reading , civil defense is a " top-down " form of organization that must be managed nationally , while civil protection is " bottom-up , " not least because local communities , where the latter must necessarily be organized , are usually the theater of disaster relief even international policies to harmonize it . Nevertheless , it is clear that the challenge of the present century is to involve the general public in managing and taking responsibility for more of its own security , whether in wealthy countries or poor ones . In the aftermath of the London bombs of 7 July 2005 , the mayor of London , Kenneth Livingstone , observed that life in the city returned to normal very quickly , as Londoners made their own intuitive risk assessments and concluded that the deaths of fifty-two victims , plus four suicide bombers , in the nearly four years that had elapsed since 11 September 2001 did not constitute a disaster. ( n93 ) This illustrates that the public will consider risks responsibly and suggests that it can , and indeed should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secrecy shrouding intelligence operations and counterterrorism planning , it is demonstrably easier to do this for civil protection than for civil defense , as well as for places where the public has full democratic rights and a voice heard by the authorities . <p> In synthesis , the aspects of emergency relief , disaster mitigation and security provision discussed in the last three sections indicate that these problems are being tackled , but innovations are slow to appear . The reason is that the global disaster management system is cumbersome , not merely because it is large , but also because it lacks constant attention and collaboration on the part of major political players who are able to positively influence it as well as sufficient involvement of stakeholders . It is now appropriate to draw the threads together and conclude on how the present-day situation may evolve in the future . CONCLUSION <p> It is axiomatic that the global problem of disasters can be solved with existing scientific and technical know-how , providing this is applied consistently and appropriately Rather than substantial increases in knowledge of hazard phenomena the solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of resources. ( n94 ) Through the ISDR the United Nations has rightly understood that the root of the problem is political and diplomatic . Thus the Hyogo Protocol , formulated at the 2005 World Conference on Disaster Reduction in Japan , emphasizes the need to draw disaster risk reduction into the mainstream of policy formulation and implementation. ( n95 ) It also highlights the need to link disaster mitigation institutionally to sustainable development . The protocol sets out comprehensively what needs to be done with respect to awareness , education , training , planning , program-building and management . It also codifies the steps , initiatives and processes needed to achieve disaster mitigation . The ISDR and Hyogo Protocol are important initiatives , but they are critically dependent on levels of commitment and funding at the implementation stage . <p> I argued above that the world community has not yet reached the threshold for radical change towards a much more effective approach to the disasters problem . Despite this , the growth in disaster impacts has sparked a record level of involvement with the problem . Reconstruction after the Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster , and that which is envisaged for New Orleans could become the most expensive to be applied in any individual city affected by a natural event . In that sense , these disasters are catalysts for change . The world community has forced the pace of international cooperation on tsunami mitigation and recovery , for example by collaborating on an early-warning system and giving publicity to insufficiencies in reconstruction funding wherever they have occurred . Hence , the appropriate general model is probably one in which major upheavals create radical change , as occurred with the tsunami , but on the cumulative basis of smaller achievements arrived at over . longer periods of time in response to both less spectacular disasters and prevailing situations of risk . <p> Disasters are milestones in the lives of people who survived them and rebuilt their lives afterwards . Certain disasters are also markers in the evolution of global approaches to mitigation . Size is one important determinant  --  as future major catastrophes will no doubt demonstrate  --  but uniqueness also counts , as it brings new aspects of the global problem into focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that aims to protect people against the effects of disaster is enacted in the wake of particular events , usually major disasters that stimulated demands for legal and organizational change . Thus , for example , in the United States the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ( P.L. 93-288 , as amended by P.L. 100-707 ) was updated in 1993 in response to Hurricane Andrew and , while it was being debated in Congress , the arrival of the Mississippi-Missouri River floods , the greatest on record in the continental United States , led to the passage of further amendments . <p> Though in recent times there have been some extraordinarily large natural and anthropogenic disasters , it will probably take one with a much greater signal potential  --  i.e. , combination of magnitude , extent and critical uniqueness  --  to propel the international community and the world financial system towards an entirely different approach to catastrophe . This system would be more effective because it would place much greater emphasis on foreseeing and preparing for impacts , rather than simply reacting to them . Conditions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely . For example , capital to finance the growing insurance liability in disasters , which are now close to 20 percent of losses , is scarce , while polarization of societies and marginalization of disadvantaged groups is increasing. ( n96 ) <p> Global physical changes may cause order-of-magnitude increases in community vulnerability and risk in the face of disasters . Major storms may become considerably more intense , wider areas of inhabited coast may become more susceptible to floods and high winds , and larger populations may become vulnerable to storm damage. ( n97 ) The growth of megacities is extending complex urban landscapes far into areas of high hazard. ( n98 ) In places such as Mexico City , Lagos and Caracas this could lead to the creation of " risk ghettos , " neighborhoods that are strongly vulnerable to a hybrid mixture of natural and technological hazards. ( n99 ) Although it is presently unclear as to what sort of event will provoke radical change in the international community 's attitude to disasters , I remain confident that within a generation there will be a more methodical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places greater weight on risk reduction rather than merely reacting to the impacts of events as they occur .
