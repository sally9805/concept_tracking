Two Worlds // Wahunsonacock and his brother Opechancanough , the two great Powhatan chiefs of the Jamestown era , were in their twenties or early thirties when the Spanish arrived . They would have known about the Jesuit mission at Kiskiack and what happened there , and may have witnessed Men ? ndez 's subsequent " chastisement . " Possibly , the threat of further Spanish attacks encouraged alliances between James River and York ( Pamunkey ) River peoples that led to the rapid expansion of the Powhatan chiefdom across the region after 1572 . But if so , the threat never materialized . Aside from occasional exploratory voyages , a full generation was to pass before another European power , the English , sought to establish a colony in the Chesapeake Bay . By that time , the Powhatans had grown into a formidable political and military force . // The Rise of the Powhatans // The rise of the Powhatan chiefdom was the central political development of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries , shaping the lives of Indian peoples living throughout the coastal plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the strangers who arrived from across the ocean . Six regions located between the upper James and York Rivers- " the Countreys of Powhatan , Arrohateck , Appamatuck , Pamunky , Youghtamond , and Mattapanient " - were inherited by Wahunsonacock sometime after 1570 and , together with lands along the lower York River , comprised the historic core of his empire . Three decades later , Wahunsonacock ruled over thirty or so tribes , spread across Tsenacommacah ( the Powhatan name for their lands ) , from south of the James River to the Potomac and from the coast to the falls . // As described by William Strachey ( a prominent settler who arrived in Virginia in 1610 ) , Wahunsonacock was a man of " goodly " looks , " well beaten with many cold and stormy wynters , " yet " of a tall stature , and cleane lymbes . " In earlier years , Strachey wrote , the great chief was a " strong and able salvadge savage , synowie , active , and of a daring spiritt , vigilant , ambitious , subtile to enlarge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had inherited , the rest of his territories had been " either by force subdued unto him , or through feare yeilded . " At about the time the English arrived , the Chesapeakes , who lived at the entrance of the Bay and had resisted absorption into Tsenacommacah , were destroyed in an attack that resulted in the slaughter of men , women , and children . In other attacks , such as that suffered by the Kecoughtans , who lived at the mouth of the James River , entire peoples were uprooted and moved to different locations to strengthen the Powhatans ' control of newly conquered territories . // A vivid example of the methods used by the great chief to assert his authority is recounted by Captain John Smith . For reasons that are unclear , in 1608 , Wahunsonacock mounted a surprise attack on neighboring Piankatanks , who lived along the north bank of the river of the same name . First , he sent some of his men to lodge among them , then he surrounded their village and , at an appointed time , launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slain . The women and children , along with the chief , were captured and presented to Wahunsonacock so that they could " doe him service " ; and to intimidate visitors , the scalps of warriors were hung between two trees at Wahunsonacock 's residence at Werowocomoco. // The Powhatans were surrounded by numerous Indian peoples who were highly influential in shaping Tsenacommacah . Southward were the Algonquians of the Roanoke region who inhabited the coastal areas of Pamlico , Albemarle , and Currituck Sounds . Inland were the Iroquoian Tuscarora , whose territories stretched a hundred miles along the North Carolina coastal plain and fall line from the Neuse River to the lands of the Meherrins and Nottoways ( also Iroquoian ) , situated on the tributaries of the Chowan . Indians known to the English as the Mangoags lived in the Carolina piedmont and enjoyed a reputation for aggressiveness in their attacks on peoples of the coastal region . Siouan-speaking Monacans and Mannahoacs , who inhabited the fertile river valleys along the upper reaches of the James and Rappahannock Rivers , were ancient enemies of the Powhatans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north were the Susquehannocks , who lived at the head of the Chesapeake Bay ; and the Massawomecks ( Iroquoians ) , who periodically journeyed from the Great Lakes by way of the Appalachians and the Shenandoah Valley to plunder settlements in the piedmont and the tidewater. // Iroquoian and Siouan peoples in the piedmont and mountains effectively confined the Powhatans to the coastal plain . Aside from periodic raids , Wahunsonacock seems to have been reluctant to engage in protracted hostilities against neighboring enemies . He may have been more concerned about consolidating his authority over the peoples within his own territories than in conducting attacks on powerful nations in far-off lands . // As Wahunsonacock 's chiefdom grew throughout the tidewater so did his wealth and influence . His people were required to pay tribute in the form of skins , beads , pearls , food , and tobacco , all collected annually and stored in temples such as those at Orapaks ( one of his capitals ) and Uttamussak . He claimed a monopoly of prestige goods that were traded in his lands , including copper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Copper was traded beyond his dominions with other peoples and used also when necessary to hire mercenary warriors . More generally , gifts of tribute goods to lesser chiefs ( weroances ) , warriors , and priests throughout his lands provided him with an effective means of rewarding those he favored. // Although Wahunsonacock was often described by English observers as a despot or tyrant , his power was not boundless and varied considerably from one area to another . Peoples of outlying regions , such as north of the Rappahannock River or the Eastern Shore , as well as the Chickahominies , who lived on the river that bears their name , behaved far more independently than those of the core area between the upper James and York Rivers . They might recognize his authority , provide support in times of war or when called upon , but they also pursued their own policies and occasionally disobeyed ( or ignored ) his orders altogether . Wahunsonacock was not an absolute ruler ; rather , he was a chief of chiefs . // Wahunsonacock governed his territories through regional or district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers Opechancanough , Opitchapam , and Kekataugh maintained tight control over the Pamunkeys ; his " sons " Parahunt and Pochins ruled the important districts of Powhatan and Kecoughtan at the falls and mouth of the James River respectively . // Opechancanough was the most powerful of Wahunsonacock 's relatives . Like his brother , he was a vigorous and potent leader at the time the English arrived . Perfectly " skill 'd in the Art of Governing , " it was said he " caused all the Indians far and near to dread his Name , and had them all entirely in his Subjection . " Other than his kinship to Wahunsonacock , his influence stemmed from his role as chief of the best-disciplined warriors in all of Tsenacommacah . The Pamunkeys had " neere 300 able men " of their own but could mobilize twice as many allies within a few days . Backed by his warriors , Opechancanough would prove a formidable enemy . // Little is known about Opechancanough 's origins , but a few intriguing references suggest that he may have been none other than Paquiquineo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ralph Hamor , wrote in 1615 that the Chickahominies were hostile to the Spanish because " Powhatans father was driven by them from the west-Indies into those parts . " A much later account by Robert Beverly related that the Powhatans did not recognize Opechancanough as Wahunsonacock 's brother but rather as " a Prince of a Foreign Nation , who came to them a great Way from the South-West : And by their Accounts , we suppose him to have come from the Spanish Indians , some-where near Mexico . " Both could be garbled stories of Paquiquineo 's stay in Mexico City and travels in the West Indies before returning to the Ajac ? n with the Jesuit fathers . But whether or not Opechancanough and Paquiquineo were the same person , there is little doubt they were contemporaries , possibly kin , and surely would have known one another . // Peoples of the Great River // Tsenacommacah was well populated at the beginning of the seventeenth century . Perhaps 15,000 people , dispersed in several hundred villages and hamlets , lived in territories belonging to the Powhatan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from exposed areas of the coast or Bayside , and corresponded to the upper branches of the major rivers and their tributaries , lands along the fall line , and the river valleys of the piedmont . Powhatan settlements , like those of peoples to the north and south , were usually situated near rivers on sheltered necks or along the smaller estuaries and tributaries . High ground close to the water was preferred because it protected against possible flooding and provided a vantage point for keeping an eye on the comings and goings along the river and on the approaches to the village from inland . // Rivers and coastal waters provided a superb means of travel and were commonly used for transporting men and goods over long distances . In the piedmont and coastal plain , rivers were used to travel east and west ; in the Valley of Virginia , the main directions were north and south , some movement going west into the Ohio River basin . Footpaths and trails supplemented the waterways and formed an intricate network across the entire eastern seaboard . The most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the northern continent from Canada to Florida , and which in the Chesapeake region followed the western edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains for much of the way before turning inland into the Valley of Virginia at Tutelo . This major trail sent off numerous branches that crisscrossed the piedmont and coastal plain or led westwards across the mountains to the Mississippi Valley . Far from being cut off from one another , settlements and regions were linked by extensive and ancient routes along which people , goods , and news moved easily . // Most Powhatan settlements were small by European standards , usually consisting of fewer than a hundred people " of kindred &amp; alliance . " As William Strachey observed : " Their howses are not manie in one towne , and those that are stand set apart and scattered , without forme of a street , far and wyde asunder . " Even the largest towns rarely contained more than twenty or thirty houses , these dotted in small groups over tens of acres . Houses throughout Tsenacommacah were of a similar design . Built like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " covered tightly " with mats , or the barkes of trees very handsomely , that notwithstanding either winde , raine or weather , they are as warme as stooves , but very smoaky. " // An illustration of Secota ( Secotan , near the Pamlico River in North Carolina ) provides an impression of such a settlement . At one end of the village is a river- " from whence they fetche their water " - that provided fish , crabs , and oysters . In the top left of the drawing , a couple of men are shown hunting deer that have strayed into the village . The layout reflects the mix of agriculture , fishing , hunting , and foraging that characterized seasonal changes in diet and the variety of local resources . Some of the larger villages , notably those inhabited by local chiefs , were more elaborately designed and included the chief ' s longhouse , mortuary temple , and storehouse , as well as areas set aside for important ceremonial functions . // * * * // Powhatan society was organized for war , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north and west-the Monacans , Mannahoacs , Susquehannocks , and Massawomecks-and Wahunsonacock 's territorial ambitions . Warfare involved a variety of tactics , such as frontal assaults , hit-and-run sorties by small raiding parties , ambush , and deception . Most attacks took the form of raiding parties involving no more than a two dozen or so warriors . In these circumstances , the object was to shoot to kill or maim the enemy from the safety of cover or to ensure weight of numbers if attacking at close range . Pitched battles between opposing armies were less common . // Indians frequently used " Stratagems , surprizes and Treacherys " to best their enemies . In a mock battle witnessed by John Smith , the Indians divided themselves into two companies of about a hundred men , one called " Monacans , " the other " Powhatans , " each company ordered into ranks of fifteen men abreast . After agreeing to terms that the women and children of the vanquished would be the prize of the victors , the two armies approached each other , the men " leaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in warres . " Each side then shot at the other ; when they had discharged all their arrows , they joined in hand-to-hand fighting : " As they got advantage they catched their enimies by the haire of the head " and acted the beating out of losers ' brains with wooden swords . When Monacan numbers decreased , the Powhatans charged in a half-moon formation in an effort to surround them , at which the Monacans fled " all in a troope " to the cover of nearby woods . This , however , was a ploy to lure the Powhatans into an ambush , where fresh warriors were hiding . The Powhatans , perceiving the danger , withdrew to an area of the field where they had arranged their own ambush , but the Monacans declined to pursue them and instead disappeared into the forest . // War was the ultimate test for every male , a searching examination where only the strong , intelligent , or lucky would survive . Men were expected to display strength and courage in hand-to-hand combat , fortitude if captured and tortured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain , they would throw insults at their enemies ) , and wisdom in council . A set of values that highlighted individual battle skills was vital to maintaining an effective fighting force and applied to all the peoples who made up Tsenacommacah , but there were important distinctions also between warrior groups . Pamunkey and Powhatans made up the core of Wahunsonacock 's fighting forces and combined may have numbered five or six hundred men . They were considered the most dependable and loyal of his warriors . In addition , the great chief and Opechancanough were able to call upon allies from neighboring peoples ( some paid for their services ) , troops who fought alongside the elite forces . A combined warrior strength of from 1,200 to 1,500 was easily large enough to overwhelm local resistance to Wahunsonacock 's will . // When important decisions , such as whether to go to war , were made , custom demanded that chiefs take advice from their counselors and priests . Counselors ( " cawcawwasoughs " or " cockerouses " ) were usually drawn from village elders , warriors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some town weroances . Priests were the principal buttress of the chief ' s authority , their avowed ability to foresee the future making them indispensable in providing political decisions . " When they intend any warres , " Smith noted , " the Werowances usually have the advice of their Priests and Conjurers , and their Allies and ancient friends , but chiefely the Priests determine their resolution . " Strachey put it more forcefully , remarking that priests " at all tymes " governed " and directed the Weroances ... in all their accions. " //
