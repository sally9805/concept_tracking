Behind a fake bookcase is a small room which contains the safe . In the other direction is Vanderspeigle 's bedroom . <p> # PAUL # ( nods ) We ca n't figure out how they disabled the alarm . We thought maybe they tried to short it out somehow . <p> " Clowns Ca n't Sleep " 45 . <p> # ISABEL # No , that would have triggered the system . <p> Isabel goes to the alarm pad . Pulls the face plate off , examines the inside . <p> ISABEL ( cont 'd ) And damaged the circuits . <p> # PAM # Well , then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ISABEL # They had to have known the code . <p> She moves on to look in the mark 's BEDROOM . <p> # PAUL # ( calls to her ) We considered that , but the mark swears that nobody in the world knew the code except him .

When he dies , we 'll probably have to physically cut all the power lines to the house to get it off line . <p> Isabel examines the computer brain of the alarm system which was locked inside a titanium case in Vanderspeigle 's bedroom closet . She answers the detective almost as an afterthought . <p> # ISABEL # There are other ways to get the code . ( to herself ) Closed loop . Redundant servers . Titanium encasement .

It 's an obviously unnatural position . Then he moves in front of the panel and types in the code as one normally would . <p> PAUL ( cont 'd )  --  then his body would block the view from across the canal . <p> # ISABEL # That 's why they probably set up over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another wall . <p> ISABEL ( cont 'd )  --  And used the mirror . <p> She points at a small mirror on the opposite wall .
