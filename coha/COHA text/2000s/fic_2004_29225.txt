THE WEDNESDAY- NIGHT SHOWCASE Buzzy , the bass player , had a suspended license , so Dave swung by his house on the way to the Wednesday-night showcase . Buzzy did quality control for a company that manufactured prosthetic devices , and lived with his wife and two kids on a street of more or less identical split levels that must have seemed like an exciting place in the days before the British Invasion , back when Kennedy was President and Elvis was King . Buzzy was the only member of the wedding band who was married , a fact whose irony did not escape the notice of his fellow musicians . Artie , the sax player and manager , had just broken up with a girl who danced at Jiggles . Stan , the drummer and sometime accordionist , was sleepwalking through a painful divorce . Ian , the singer/keyboardist and all-around showman , was living at home with his parents , as was Dave , who handled rhythm guitar and background vocals . Buzzy was waiting by the curb , a scrawny , ponytailed guy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand and a guitar case in the other . He stowed his bass in the backseat , on top of Dave 's Les Paul , and climbed in . " Daverino , " he said , tilting the beer can in salute . " Buzzmaster . " Dave shifted into gear and headed for Central Avenue . The silence in the car was mellow , uncomplicated . Buzzy took a swig from the can and smacked his lips . " Yup . Another Wednesday-night showcase . " " You ready ? The people are counting on you . " Buzzy thought it over for a couple of seconds , then nodded . " Coach , " he said , " I'mgonna play my heart out . " Dave snorted his appreciation . The guys in the band liked to joke about the showcase , but they were careful not to complainbookings had doubled since Artie found them the slot . And besides , goofy as it was , the showcase turned out to be a real time-saver : instead of scheduling separate auditions for every interested couple , the Wishbones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every third Wednesday of the month . " You going out afterward ? " Buzzy crushed the can in his hand and dropped it on the floor . " I 'm in the mood for a few beers . " " I ca n't . I 'm supposed to go over to Julie 's . " " Hey . " Buzzy did n't bother to conceal his surprise . " You guys really getting back together ? " Dave did n't feel like going into the details . He had made a mistake telling the guys what had happened in the first place . He should have known he 'd never hear the end of it . Now the incident had become part of band lore , like the night Ian got propositioned by the mother-of-the-bride , and that time Artie got his lights punched out by a Puerto Rican DJ . " We 've been talking on the phone . She says her parents are n't so upset anymore . " Dave kept his eyes on the road . He did n't have to look to know that Buzzy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . Just to see the look on their faces . " Dave grimaced . The look on their faces was the last thing he wanted to think about . " We 've been going out for a long time . I guess it was bound to happen sooner or later . " " A long time ? " Buzzy seemed to be deriving great pleasure from the conversation . " Fifteen years , Dave . You 've been going out with the woman for fifteen years . Since your sophomore year of high school . " $5.99 BUFFET , proclaimed the marquee outside the Cranwood Ramada . SHOWCASE OF MUSICAL TALENT . Dave pulled into the sparsely occupied lot , glad for the opportunity to change the subject . " Looks like a slow night . " He put the car into park and shut off the ignition . Buzzy was n't about to give up so easily . " What are you going to say to her parents ? " Dave undid his seat belt and opened the door . It was a lovely spring night . Leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and started walking at a brisk pace toward the entrance of the Sundown Lounge . Buzzy had to run to catch up with him , the hardshell cases banging like luggage against the outside of his legs . " Bring flowers , " he advised , panting a little from the exertion . " You 'll need all the help you can get . " Sparkle was nearing the end of their set when Dave and Buzzy entered the lounge . Their lead singer , Alan Zelack , was strutting across the stage in his red sequined tux , belting out " My Girl " in the heavy-metal falsetto he 'd perfected during years of touring with the Misty Mountain Revue , a wildly successful Led Zeppelin tribute show . Now everything he touched came out sounding like Zeppelin , from Sinatra to the Hokey Pokey . Artie and Ian were sitting at a table in the corner , looking like a couple trapped in a bad marriage . Both of them seemed relieved by the arrival of some new blood . " Guess what ? " Buzzy said , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs . " Dave 's going over to Julie 's later on . " " No way , " said Ian . " Bullshit , " said Artie . Dave held up both hands in a futile plea for restraint . " Do n't ask . It 's none of your fucking business . " But it was already too late . The story had moved into the public domain . Artie turned to Ian , smiling nervously . " Mr. Muller , sir ? I 'm not sure if you remember me . I 'm Dave ... Dave Raymond ? " Ian inhaled through his teeth , looking puzzled . " Sorry , Dave . The name does n't ring a bell . " " You know , " Artie added helpfully , " the guy you caught poking your daughter ? " Ian clapped himself in the forehead . " Oh , that Dave . How could I have forgotten . Come on in . Honey , guess who 's here ? " Even Dave bad to laugh at that . All day long he 'd been dreading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd run through a number of scenarios in his head , but none of them included the possibility that he 'd have to jog their memories about the circumstances of their last meeting . " If they do n't recognize you , " Buzzy suggested , " you can always try pulling your pants down . " Dave 's bandmates traded high fives as Sparkle launched into " Stairway to Heaven , " their final song of every showcase performance . It was the secret of their immense popularity , the ultimate sales pitch to a generation that could n't imagine a special occasion that would n't be made even more special by a faithful live version of what radio station after radio station had determined to be " the most popular song of all-time . " " Fuckin ' Stairway , " mumbled Artie . Ian glanced at the stage . " Look at that fool . " Zelack was sparkling in the spotlight , eyes closed , mouth pressed lovingly to the mike as he crooned the immortal gibberish about hedgerows and spring cleaning . Dave pushed his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this shit , " he said , to no one in particular . It was better outside . The night was quiet and the air seemed reasonably fresh for this part of the world . Dave sat down on the curb by the fire lane and stared at the lopped-off moon glowing dully above the Parkway overpass . He liked being part of the Wishbones , and he liked the other guys in the group , but sometimes the showcase got to him . It was more the atmosphere than anything else , the unmistakable odor of mediocrity that seemed to be as much a part of the Sundown Lounge as the paper tablecloths and the green leatherette menus . Alan Zelack pissed him off too , and it was n't just the sequined tuxedo or his idiotic falsetto . Four years earlier , Dave had auditioned for the Misty Mountain Revue . He was n't a huge Zeppelin fan , but he was unemployed at the time and would 've killed for a chance to make some money playing rock ' n roll on a regular basis . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " solo note for note , every bend , hammer , and blast of feedback accounted for . But he did n't get the job . " You 've got the chops , " Zelack told him afterward . " There 's no doubt about that . But this is show business . You 've got to look the part . " The sad thing was , Dave knew he was right . Zelack looked like a rock star . He was tall and whip thin , with high cheekbones and the mutant jaw of a born singer . Dave , on the other hand , just looked like a regular guy . He was an inch or two shorter than average , maybe a bit on the stocky side . Once , out of curiosity , he 'd squeezed himself into a pair of leather pants , and it had n't been a pretty sight . Tonight , though , he had bigger things to worry about than his inability to pass for Jimmy Page . The guys could laugh all they wanted ; Dave was the one who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and try to conduct some sort of halfway civil chitchat with people who would n't have to use their imagination to picture him hopping from foot to foot , naked except for a hot pink condom . It was ironic in a way . He and Julie had been having sex since they were sixteen . They had been reckless back thenno self-restraint , no birth control , no common sense . They used to screw in the basement rec room with her parents right upstairs , snoring in dreamland . If they were going to be caught , they should have been caught back then , at the height of their passion , back when they used to stare at each other 's bodies in stupefied amazement , and compete to see who could say " I love you " more times in a single night . It did n't make any sense to be caught now , when they 'd already been through an abortion , four different breakups , mutual infidelities , and so many bitter discussions about the future that they did n't bother to talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more or less chronic yeast infection that had turned their lovemaking into a polite and tentative activity , full of murmured questions and apologies . Not now , when it was embarrassing enough just to be over thirty and still fucking in the rec room . But Mr. and Mrs. Muller did n't care about any of that . They were supposed to have been in Atlantic City that afternoon , but Mr. Muller had forgotten his wallet , and had n't realized it until two hours into the drive . So they 'd just turned around and come on homewhat else was there to do ? only to find their youngest daughter on her hands and knees on the rec room floor , and Dave kneeling behind her , singing along with the unbearably loud music blasting from the stereo ( John Mellencamp , Julie 's favorite ) , the volume of which had apparently concealed the noise of their arrival . What transpired after that remained mercifully fuzzy in Dave 's memory . All he really remembered was the bloodless shock on Julie 's mother 's face as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the neon condom ( a random selection from a novelty assortment he 'd purchased in Greenwich Village ) , only to discover that his right foot had fallen asleep . " Mrs. Muller , " he 'd assured her , reaching down like Adam to conceal his shame while unsuccessfully trying to balance on his left foot , " this is n't what you think . " A car door slammed . Dave looked up and saw a bulky , apparently perturbed man come jogging across the parking lot in a tuxedo . As he drew closer , Dave heard him mumbling to himself as he fumbled with the hooks of his cummerbund . " Slow down , " he called out . " You 're not late . " Stan stopped running and peered in the direction of the voice , shading his eyes with one hand as though it were daytime . " Dave ? " " Yeah . " " What are you doing out here ? " " You got any better ideas ? " Stan 's only response was to trudge over to the curb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaled wearily and stretched his legs out in front of him , revealing a pair of battered work boots protruding like loaves from the cuffs of his black trousers . " Artie 's not going to like that , " Dave pointed out . " I lost my good shoes , " Stan explained . " I turned the damn house upside down trying to find them . That 's why I 'm late . " " Do n't sweat it . It 's only the showcase . " " I looked everywhere , " Stan continued , an edge of desperation creeping into his voice . " I mean , what did they do ? Get up and take a walk without me ? " Stan had been a wreck for the past couple of months , ever since his wife announced that she was leaving him for her boss , a fifty-five-year-old lawyer with strange puffy hair who appeared in his own TV commercials , encouraging viewers to consider legal remedies for a host of everyday mishaps and conditions . Never the most reliable guy to begin with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beginning to jeopardize his situation with Artie , who insisted on running the Wishbones like a business . He 'd been late for two gigs in the past month ( once because he 'd locked his keys in his car , and once because he 'd driven all the way to the Royal Oak before remembering that the reception was actually at the Blue Spruce ) ; on a third occasion he 'd shown up on time , but without drumsticks . " I do n't try to fuck up , " he explained , as if Dave had inquired about this possibility . " I 've just got a lot on my mind right now . " " No problem . " Dave patted him on the shoulder blade . " It happens to everyone . " Stan nodded for a long time , as though the secrets of the universe were being revealed to him one by one . " Do me a favor , " he said . " Tell that to Artie . " Phil Hart and His Heartstring Orchestra were tuning up on stage #2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one hand and drum stand in the other . Sparkle was breaking down their equipment on stage #1 , and when they were finished , the Wishbones would begin setting up . The two stagesone at either end of the loungewere the key to the smooth operation of the showcase . As always , Phil and the boys opened with a surprisingly spunky version of " Celebration , " by Kool and the Gangsurprising , because with the exception of the drummer ( Phil 's grandson , a pockmarked recovering drug addict named Joey ) , everyone in the combo had more or less vivid memories of the Hoover administration . Walter , the piano player , whose hands shook terribly when he was doing anything but tickling the ivories , was rumored to be eighty-two years old . Despite their age , powder blue uniforms , and schizoid repertoire , the Heartstring Orchestra was made up of real musicians , old pros from the Big Band era ( the reed player 's twin brother had apparently toured for a couple of years with Tommy Dorsey ) . When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suited to their talents " Chattanooga Choo-Choo , " " Paper Doll , " " Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy " you could n't help but notice a change of weather inside the Sundown Lounge . Fingers started snapping ; heads began to bob . It was n't unusual to see a natty-looking older couplethe Orchestra specialized in second and third marriagesput down their drinks and take a graceful turn around the dance floor . Phil Hart himself was n't the greatest singer in the world , but he was a true showman . The man had style . Dave always took a moment to admire his distinctive way of moving onstage , a high-elbowed liquidy sway that was the essence of geriatric cool . If you asked , Phil would happily reveal the secret of his remarkable vitality . " Artificial hips ! " he 'd exclaim , shaking his head at the marvels of modern technology . " I can wiggle again ! " One of the things Dave liked best about the wedding band was its efficiency . They could set up in twenty minutes and break down even faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played in had been weighed down by so much equipment that he 'd felt more like a roadie than a musician . Lockjaw was the worst offender . He remembered an outdoor Battle of the Bands where they 'd taken four hours to set up for a forty-five-minute performance marred by such earsplitting shrieks of feedback that even the die-hard headbangers in the audience were squeezing their ears , begging for mercy . ( Lockjaw came in fifth out of five bands and dissolved a few months later . ) The Wishbones made music on a more human scale . Dave had joined the band with a number of reservationsthe uniforms , the cheesy tunes , Artie 's reputation as a ballbusterbut he quickly came to realize that the rewards went far beyond the two hundred dollars he got for playing a four-hour gig . It turned out , amazingly enough , to be a blast . People drank at weddings . They danced like maniacs . They clapped and hooted and made requests . Every now and then , when the chemistry was right , things got raucous . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the volume and rock , with no apologies to anyone . Dave had friends who were still chasing their dreams , playing in dingy clubs to audiences of twelve bored drunks , splitting thirty-nine dollars among four guys at the end of the night , then dragging themselves home at three o'clock in the morning . He saw the best of them growing exhausted and bitter , endlessly chewing over the thankless question of why the world still did n't give a shit . Dave himself still had n't completely surrendered his dream of the Big Time , but he had moved it to the back burner . Someday , maybe , the perfect band would come along , a band so good that no one would be able to say no to them . Until then , though , Dave was a Wishbone , and it was a helluva lot better than nothing . Afterwards , because the event came to seem so significant in retrospect , he sometimes found himself trying to reconstruct it in his memory , as though the smallest detail might hold the key to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up when the Heartstring Orchestra broke into " Like a Virgin , " their next-to-last tune of the night . If Madonna had happened to wander into the Sundown to check out the showcase , Dave thought she would have approved . Phil Hart gave the song a hilarious deadpan interpretation , as though it had never entered his mind that some people might find it amusing to see a seventy-three-year-old man with artificial hips doing a dignified shimmy at the mike stand as he sang about being touched for the very first time . Dave leaned his guitar against his amp and stepped down from the rickety wooden platform that served as stage #1 . He waved to the waitress , a brassy-haired woman of indeterminate age named Hilda , and mimed the act of bringing a glass to his mouth . Hilda nodded , but moved across the lounge in the opposite direction to wait on some paying customers , a young couple holding hands across the table and gazing at each other with that blissful prenewlywed intensity that would somehow evolve over the next two decades into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ian sidled up to him a few seconds later that Dave realized he 'd been frozen in place , the invisible empty glass still tilted to his lips . " Mick Box , " said Ian . " Shit , " said Dave . At every Wishbone function , Ian tried to stump Dave with a piece of rock trivia . He specialized in obscure British musicians from second-rate bands of the early seventies . " Take your time , " Ian taunted . " It 'll come to you . " " Mick Box , " Dave chanted . " Mick Box ... Mick Box ... Mick Box ... " " You probably have n't thought about this band for fifteen years . " A face began to take shape in Dave 's mind . Narrow , ferrety features . The obligatory hair . " I 'm seeing a mustache , " he said . " If it 's a Fu Manchu , you 're definitely getting warmer . " " I want to say Mott the Hoople , but that 's Mick Ronson . " Dave 's eyes strayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mick in a band he had n't thought about for fifteen years . Up on stage #2 , Phil Hart was twisting his way through a musical interlude in " Like a Virgin . " On stage #1 , Artie was lecturing Stan about proper Wishbone attire , frowning and jabbing his finger in the direction of the offending work boots . Stan kept nodding like a kid , mouthing the words , " Okay , okay , " over and over again . " I give up , " said Dave . " Is it Slade ? " " Close , " groaned Ian . He winced as though pained on Dave 's behalf . " Mick Box was in Uriah Heep . " " Damn . I used to love Uriah Heep . " " Easy Livin ' , " agreed Ian . " One of the great tunes of all time . " " Mick Box , " laughed Dave . " What the fuck kind of name is that ? " In the middle of the lounge , the gazers were still enraptured with one another while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At a nearby table , Alan Zelack touched wineglasses with a ridiculously beautiful woman in a slinky black dress who appeared to have materialized out of nowhere . With the sixth sense of a complete asshole , Zelack turned slowly , grinning with triumphant smugness , and raised his glass in greeting . Dave pretended not to notice . " What the fuck kind of name is Uriah Heep ? " Ian wondered . That was when it happened . Dave looked up just in time to watch Phil Hart stop singing in the middle of the final chorus . A look of mild surprise passed across his facerecognition , Dave would later decideas he turned slightly to the left . He wobbledthere was no other word for itand the microphone slipped through his fingers , bouncing off the stage with a percussive cough of static . Joey stopped drumming and looked around in alarm . Phil remained upright for a moment , empty-handed and wonder stricken , before sinking , almost gently , to his knees . Walter kept pounding his electric piano , oblivious to everything but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big . He flung his arms wide like Al Jolson , as if to embrace his fate , and then pitched suddenly forward , landing facedown on the stage in a position he never would have chosen if he 'd been offered even the slightest amount of choice in the matter . Two hours later , drained and without flowers , Dave pulled up in front of Julie 's house . He sat in the car for a few minutes listening to the engine tick , trying to work up the energy to open the door . For the first time in his life , he had actually watched someone diea man he liked and admiredand for the moment , at least , everything else seemed insubstantial , not fully serious . The thought of facing Julie 's parents no longer disturbed him . Instead he felt a strange tenderness , as though he were preparing to visit them in the hospital . It had n't taken Phil Hart a long time to die , but an eternity seemed to have passed between the moment of his collapse and the arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paralyzed , as though everyone were simply waiting for Phil to leap up and finish the song . Finally , Mel , the arthritic sax player , bent down with visible difficulty and retrieved the fallen microphone . " Phil 's hurt , " he announced , in a voice too calm for the circumstances . " Would someone be kind enough to call an ambulance ? " The Sundown burst into a hectic flurry of motion , with people scattering in several different directions at once , shouting for a telephone . Dave and Ian rushed across the lounge to check on Phil . " Is there a doctor in the house ? " Mel inquired . " How about a nurse ? " By the time Dave reached the edge of stage #2 , Joey had already emerged from behind his drum kit , rolled Phil onto his back , and begun loosening the buttons of his ruffled shirt . Phil submitted patiently to these ministrations , his awestruck face turned to the ceiling . Even then , from a distance of about ten feet , Dave could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implored him . " Grampa , please . " " Is there a doctor in the house ? " Mel repeated . " Does anyone know CPR ? " Dave hunched his shoulders and took a step back from the stage , trying to look as inconspicuous as possible . He had taken a CPR class in high school , but all he remembered was that Ralph Vergiliak had pretended to hump the dummy , earning himself a week 's detention . " Grampa . " Joey 's voice was stern now , as though he were scolding the dead man for his lack of cooperation . He grabbed hold of Phil 's shoulders and gave them a hard shake . " Come on now , Grampa . " From the corner of his eye , Dave caught a brilliant flash of red . Before he understood what he was looking at , Alan Zelack had rushed across the stage , shoved Joey out of the way , and begun CPR . The whole sequence came back to Dave as he watchedthe head tilt , the sweep of the mouth with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The multiple chest compressions for every breath of air . Zelack performed these actions with ostentatious competence , his blond hair flying , his red tuxedo shooting off tiny urgent flares . Dave 's first , ungenerous impulse was to resent him for hogging the spotlight even in a tragedy , but that quickly passed , replaced by a grudging sense of respect . Like everyone else gathered around the stage , Zelack must have known that Phil was already dead . And yet he kept trying fiercely to bring him back , pumping his chest and filling his lungs , minute after interminable minute , until the ambulance finally arrived , and Phil 's body became the property of professionals . The Wishbones played their set anyway . They thought about canceling , but a couple had traveled all the way from Belvidere with their wedding consultant to check them out , and did n't want to have make the trek again . As a courtesy to them , Artie decided that the show must go on . Dave felt a little weird about it , but as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " his reservations vanished . The music jolted him like an electric shock . It seemed to pass through his body on its way from the guitar to the amp , cleansing him , reminding him of how good it felt to be alive . And it was n't just Dave , either . Buzzy , who usually stood stone-faced and motionless while he played , was grinning with amazement , rocking from side to side as he plucked out the pulse of the song . Ian had abandoned his usual two-bit Elvis impersonation and was singing like he meant it , while Stan pounded the drums as though exorcising the demons from his life . Even Artie caught the wave . The solo jumped out of his horn , every note of it a fresh squawk of pleasure . It seemed to Dave that the song had never existed before , that they 'd invented it on the spot . Somehow they kept the momentum for ten more tunes , finding something real in even the tiredest old standards . When they had run the gamut of their repertoire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ian surprised them all by breaking into one last song on his piano , something the Wishbones had never done before . " This is for Phil , " he said . " Rest in peace , brother . " The chords were simple , and Dave recognized them right away . He had n't played " Knockin ' on Heaven 's Door " since high school , back when he was lead guitarist in a band called Exit 36 . Listening to the words now , colored as they were by death , Dave wondered what they could have meant to a bunch of teenagers in a suburban garage in 1979 , kids whose idea of heaven was half an ounce of Colombian Gold and a girl with big tits to smoke it with . But then he stopped wondering and gave himself up to the song . He closed his eyes and sang the chorus with every ounce of strength in his body . It was a blessing . Rest in peace , brother . Julie answered the door in gray sweatpants and a baggy orange T-shirt . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marking the page . " You lucked out , " she whispered , jerking her thumb in the direction of upstairs . " They went to bed . " As he had on countless nights before this one , Dave followed her down the carpeted stairs to the rec room . As always , Julie left the door open , a somewhat discredited token of good faith to her parents . He pulled off his tuxedo jacket and draped it over the armrest of the brown-and-beige-plaid couch . " Sorry I 'm late . Things got messed up at the showcase . " She shrugged . " It 's probably better this way . They still have n't really forgiven you . Or me , for that matter . " " You ca n't really blame them . " Julie did n't respond one way or the other . She plopped down on the couch and stretched her legs out in front of her , resting them on the coffee table next to the bowl of chips that had supplied her bookmark . One leg of her sweatpants was pushed all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one extended down to her ankle . She put her hands behind her head and smiled up at him . " So what happened at the showcase ? " Dave opened his mouth to tell her about Phil Hart , but something went haywire in his brain . He looked at her and thought how pretty she was , smiling up at him , rubbing her heel over her bare shin , waiting for his answer . He thought of how much they 'd been through together , and how crazy he was to imagine that he would ever want more from life than she 'd be able to give him . He spoke without intending to , and did n't really gauge the significance of his words until it was too late , until she was already off the couch and in his arms . " Let 's get married , " is what he 'd told her . Then Came Heaven By LaVyrle Spencer G. P. Putnam 's Sons TAILER                    @
