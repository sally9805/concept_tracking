On the day James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the structure of DNA , Crick was heard to remark that they had " found the secret of life . " With all due respect for DNA , I would like to nominate another candidate for secret of life : non-zero-sumness . An ugly word , I know , but remember : deoxyribonucleic acid did n't get where it is today on the basis of its looks . <P> Alas , unlike Francis Crick , I ca n't claim to have discovered the secret I 'm touting . It was discovered half a century ago by the founders of game theory , John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern . They made a distinction between zero-sum games and non-zero-sum games . In zero-sum games , the fortunes of the players are inversely related . In tennis , in chess , in boxing , one contestant 's gain is the other 's loss . In non-zero-sum games , one player 's gain need n't be bad news for the other(s) . <P> Indeed , in highly non-zero-sum games the players ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 astronauts were trying to get their stranded spaceship back to Earth , the outcome would be either equally good for all of them or equally bad . ( It was equally good . ) <P> Since game theory was born , it has found ever broader application . Genes , for example , can be viewed as players . The handful of genes in a primordial one-celled organism were in roughly the position of the Apollo astronauts . They were in the same boat  --  a dinky bloblike boat  --  and so faced an ultimatum : cooperate to sustain your vehicle or die . <P> The genes did n't think about this logic , of course . But since genes that did n't comply with it  --  did n't interact constructively  --  were dumped by natural selection , life came to be filled with teams of genes that played non-zero-sum games well . Larger and larger teams of genes played more and more elaborate games . In other words , more complex life forms evolved , notably including Homo sapiens . Basically , you are a large and well-played non-zero-sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-zero-sum games , are good at playing them . Vampire bats returning from a successful blood-sucking expedition share the proceeds with bat buddies that had a tougher night on the parasitism front . Since these magnanimous bats will someday be needy themselves , this reciprocal altruism is a win-win game . Natural selection favored animals good at win-win gamesmanship . <P> No other animal plays non-zero-sum games as tirelessly as we do . Much of your emotional life is natural selection 's way of getting you to play . Gratitude for favors rendered and guilt over neglecting a friend help you start or sustain potentially win-win games . <P> The words on this page  --  indeed , words , period  --  are a product of non-zero-sumness . The game theorist Thomas Schelling has noted that in a purely zero-sum game there is no rational reason to communicate . If you see opposing coaches talking before a football game , they are probably talking about some realm where their interests overlap  --  swapping gossip , maybe , or rescheduling a game to avoid injuries in bad weather . But neither coach has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
