Taking It By JENNIFER CRUSIE ST . MARTIN 'S PRESS Matilda Goodnight stepped back from her latest mural and realized that of all the crimes she 'd committed in her thirty-four years , painting the floor-to-ceiling reproduction of van Gogh 's sunflowers on Clarissa Donnelly 's dining room wall was the one that was going to send her to hell . God might forgive her the Botticelli Venus she 'd painted in the bathroom in Iowa , the Uccello battle scene she 'd done for the boardroom in New Jersey , even the Bosch orgy she 'd painted in the bedroom in Utah , but these giant , glaring sunflowers were going to be His Last Straw . " I gave you a nice talent , " He was going to say to her on Judgment Day , " and this is what you did with it . " Tilda felt her lungs tighten and stuck her hand in her pocket to make sure she had her inhaler . Beside her , Clarissa wrapped her thin little arms around her size two chenille sweater and squinted at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it ? " " Yes , " Tilda said with regret and handed her the museum print of the original . " The flowers look so ... angry , " Clarissa said . " Well . " Tilda closed her paint box . " He was nuts . " Clarissa nodded . " I heard about that . The ear . " " Yeah , that got a lot of press . " Tilda shrugged off her paint shirt . " So I 'll take my completion check " " Did you sign it ? " Clarissa said . " You need to sign it . I want everybody to know it 's a real Matilda Veronica mural . " " I signed it . " Tilda pointed the toe of her paint-stained canvas shoe at the bottom where she 'd scrawled " Matilda Veronica . " " Right there . Now I have to be going " " You did n't sign it van Gogh , ' did you ? " Clarissa bent down . " Would n't that be forgery ? " " Not unless he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tilda tried to take a deep breath . " So I 'll take that check " " Write your name bigger , " Clarissa said , straightening . " I want everybody to know you painted this . I 'm going to keep the magazine right here , too . So they know that it 's a real Matilda Veronica " Clarissa 's enthusiasm for her as a brand name had lost its appeal many days before , so Tilda changed the subject . " Well , Spot was certainly a champ about the whole thing . " She nodded at Clarissa 's elongated little dog on the theory that people were always pleased when you talked about their animals . " His tail is almost hiding your name , " Clarissa said . Tilda let her glasses slide down her nose a little and looked over the rims at Spot , quivering at her feet . She 'd done some dog face-lifting in the mural since Spot 's beady eyes almost met over his long knife-edged nose . She 'd softened the gray that streaked his dark , shaggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much like a very small , mutant wolf . " You have to sign it again , " Clarissa said . " Sign it up at the top . Bigger . " " No , " Tilda said . " Everyone will see it because they 'll be comparing Spot to the painting . People always do that , look at the dog and then look at the painting " " No they wo n't , " Clarissa said , triumphant . " He goes back to the pound today . " " You 're taking your dog to the pound ? " At Tilda 's feet , Spot pressed against her , shedding on her jeans . " He 's not my dog , " Clarissa said . " You always put dogs in your murals " " No I do n't , " Tilda said . " it said so in the magazine , so I had to have one , too , or people would n't think it was a real Matilda Veronica , so I went and got the only purebred they had . " " Spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dachshund , " Clarissa said . " He 'll be fine back at the pound . He 's used to it . I 'm the third person who 's adopted him . " Tilda pulled out her inhaler and inhaled . It made sense when she thought about it . Clarissa was exactly the kind of woman who 'd go to Rent-A-Dog and get a designer second for fake warmth in her faux Postimpressionist wall painting . Spot looked up at her now , shaking , almost as pathetic as he was ugly . I am not going to rescue you , Tilda thought , capping her inhaler . I ca n't save everybody , I 'm asthmatic , and I do n't want a dog , especially not one who acts like he snorts coke and looks like he rolls in it . " Sign it again up here , " Clarissa said . " I 'll get you a Sharpie . " " No , " Tilda said . " I signed it . It 's done . And I 'll take the completion check now , thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that signature " Clarissa began , and Tilda pushed her glasses up the bridge of her nose and turned steely eyes on her . Clarissa nodded . " I 'll go get that check , then . " Left alone with Spota hell of a name for a dog that had noneTilda tried to think of something besides the pound . There was the mural , another success , another chunk of money off the family debt , another two weeks painted from her life by ripping off art history Her cell phone rang and cut short her stab at optimism . Tilda flipped open the cover . " Hell-o . " " Tilda , " her mother said , " we have a problem . " " Really , " Tilda said , staring at the sunflowers . " Who 'd have guessed ? " " It 's bad , " Gwen said , and Tilda stopped , taken aback by the seriousness in her mother 's voice . Gwennie did muffins and Double-Crostics , not serious . " Okay , so whatever it is , we 'll fix it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he gazed back at her , desperation in his eyes . " What is it ? " " Nadine sold a Scarlet . " Tilda jerked her head up as her stomach cramped . In the background on the phone , she heard her sixteen-year-old niece say , " I still do n't get what I did wrong , " and she went cold all over . " There are n't any Scarlets . " Tilda tried to draw a deep breath while not throwing up . " Dad sold them all . " " Not the first one , " Gwen said . " Remember ? He could n't because it was of our building . Nadine found it in the basement . And the woman who bought it wo n't give it back . I asked . " Clarissa came back with the check and Tilda took it . " Thank you , " she said to Clarissa and then spoke into the phone . " Ask again . " " I tried . She hung up on me and I called again and Mason Phipps answered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew slower . " Mason was an old friend of your father 's . He 's the one who told her about Scarlet and the gallery . And he invited me to dinner tonight . " " Oh , good . One of us will have a hearty meal . " " So I thought I 'd go and distract them and you could sneak in and steal it , " Gwen said . " And then we can bury it in the basement again . " Tilda turned away from Clarissa and whispered into the phone . " You do realize you do n't get muffins in prison ? " She tried again for a deep breath , fighting back the nausea . " And when we get it back , we 're burning it . If I 'd known it was down th " " Something wrong ? " Clarissa said from behind her . " No , " Tilda said to her . " Everything is peachy . " She spoke into the phone . " I 'm coming home . I 'll be there in four hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We never do , " Gwen said and hung up . " I certainly hope everything 's okay , " Clarissa said , looking avid . " Everything is always okay , " Tilda said bitterly . " That 's what I do . I make everything okay . " She stuffed the check in her shirt pocket and looked down at Spot , trembling on her foot . " Which is why I 'm taking your dog . " " What ? " Clarissa said , but Tilda had already scooped Spot up , his long body drooping over her arm while his feet tried for purchase on her hip . " Just saving you a trip to the pound , " Tilda said . " Have a lovely day . " She carted her paint box and the dog out to her beat-up yellow van , simmering with exasperation and another emotion she did n't quite recognize but thought might be fear . It put an acrid taste in her mouth , and she did n't like it . Once on the passenger seat , Spot simmered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said to him , as she put the van in gear . " Anything 's better than jail . " Spot looked at her strangely . " The pound . I meant the pound . " She talked to him all the way home , and by the time she pulled into the fenced lot behind the Goodnight Gallery , Spot was asleep and she was calmer . When she shut off the motor , he jerked awake , his eyes like marbles , and she carried him , now heaving with anxiety , into the shabby gallery office and deposited him on the floor in front of her mother and niece , both of them looking blonde and blue-eyed and cute . So not like me , Tilda thought . Behind them , Gwennie 's bubbler jukebox played " No , No , Not Again , " by the Three Degrees . " This is Spot , " she said to Gwen and Nadine . " I 'm finding him a home where people will treat him with dignity and not sell him down the river while his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Nadine said , her pretty face defiant under her mop of pale curls . She was wearing a black T-shirt that said BITE ME in Gothic letters , but she still looked like Shirley Temple in a snit . " Nobody told me we could n't sell paintings . We 're an art gallery , for cripe 's sake . " She crouched down on the worn Oriental rug to pet Spot , who backed away , still heaving , his eyes peeled for a getaway . " What is wrong with this dog ? " " So many things , " Tilda said . " About the painting ? " " While you were in Iowa , " Gwen said to her , " Nadine broke curfew and Andrew sent her down to clean the basement as a punishment . " Tilda took a deep breath and thought of a few choice things to say to her ex-brother-in-law . " You can stop looking so mad , " Nadine said " Dad did n't let me in the locked part . I still do n't know what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Right . " Nadine rolled her eyes . " Nadine . " Tilda pushed her glasses up the bridge of her nose and looked down at her , and Nadine swallowed and sat up a little straighter . " You are not in a position to push your luck here . The painting . " " Dad made me clean the back storeroom , " Nadine said . " It was full of furniture painted with animals . Dad said you did it when you were my age . It was pretty cool , especially the bed when we 'd cleaned it off and set it up " " We ? " Tilda said . " Ethan and me , " Nadine said . " You did n't think I cleaned that whole place out by myself ? " " So Ethan knows . " Tilda consigned Andrew to the lowest circle of hell for criminal stupidity , in sending not only his daughter down there but also her nonfamily best friend . " Well , he knows there 's furniture down there , yeah , " Nadine said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It 's furniture . " " Right . " Tilda realized her lungs were closing up again and got her inhaler out . " Are we close to the painting yet ? " " It was in there , " Nadine said . " It was wrapped in paper and stuck in a cabinet , the one with the turquoise monkeys on it . Did you really paint all those animals ? " " It 's junk . I was going through a phase . " Tilda hit the inhaler . " So you pulled the painting out and then what ? " " We thought it was good , " Nadine said . " So you sold it , " Tilda said . " No . We put it back in the cabinet and put dustsheets on everything and went to Cup O ' Joe 's . And then today , Grandma had to go to the bank , and this Mrs. Lewis came in and asked if we had any paintings by somebody named Scarlet , and I said no , all we had was Dorcas Finsters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to get rid of those ? I know she lives here , but they 're really depressing , and I think we could " " Nadine , " Tilda said . " Okay . " Nadine crossed her arms . " And Mrs. Lewis said no , she wanted paintings that looked like a kid had painted them , and she started talking about checkerboard skies and stars , and Ethan was here and he said , That 's like the one we found in your basement , ' and she would not leave until we showed it to her . " " Ethan said that , " Tilda said . " Or maybe me . " Nadine squinted at the ceiling . " I 'm not sure . Ask Ethan . " " Like Ethan would n't lie down on burning coals for you , " Tilda said . " So you went and got the painting ... " " And she offered me a hundred dollars for it and I said no , " Nadine said virtuously . " And yet , the painting is not here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept saying no and when she got to a thousand I caved , " Nadine said . " Now will somebody tell me why that was bad ? " " No . " Gwen sank down on the couch next to her granddaughter , looking much like Nadine was going to look in forty years , pale-eyed , graying , and gamine . " Where 's your mom ? " Tilda asked Nadine . She turned to Gwen . " Why was n't Eve watching the gallery ? " " She had a teacher 's meeting , " Gwen said . " Summer school . She 's aiding again . Look , this Lewis woman is not going to return it . And the more fuss we make , the more suspicious we look . " " Suspicious about what ? " Nadine said . " Nobody tells me anything . " She reached down and scooped Spot off the faded rug , and his tremors picked up again . " If you do n't tell me stuff , you ca n't blame me when I screw up . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patted the dog , and Tilda thought , She 's right . She pulled out the ancient desk chair so it was facing Nadine and sat down , wincing as it creaked . " Okay , here it is . " " No , " Gwen said . " She 's sixteen . " " Yeah , and how old was I ? " Tilda said . " I ca n't remember a time I did n't know . " " Hello ? " Nadine waved . " I 'm right here . Know what ? " " Do you remember how successful the gallery used to be , when Grandpa ran it ? " Tilda said . " No , " Nadine said . " I was a kid when he died . I was n't really into the gallery thing then . " She relaxed her hold on Spot , who struggled out of her lap , hit the rug with a splat , and recovered by putting his paws up on Tilda . " Well , one of the reasons we were successful was that Grandpa sometimes sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nadine said . " That 's good , " Gwen said , her hands gripped together in her lap . " The more people who know that the better . " " I wo n't tell , " Nadine said . " Some of the paintings that were real were by a man named Homer Hodge , " Tilda plowed on , " and Grandpa made a lot of money off him legally . But then he and Homer had a fight , and Homer stopped sending him paintings , so your grandpa got the bright idea of inventing a daughter for Homer named Scarlet , and he sold five paintings by her , making a big deal out of the fact that she was a Hodge . " Gwen slumped back against the couch and stared at the ceiling , shaking her head . " Invented a daughter ? " Nadine said . " Cool . " " No , not cool . " Tilda picked up Spot , needing something to hold on to for the next part , and Spot sighed and curled his long , furry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold was the first Scarlet , a fake painting by a fake artist . And that 's fraud and we could go to jail . And people are going to realize it 's a fake because Homer was from a farm in southern Ohio , and the painting you sold is of this building . " " I thought it looked familiar , " Nadine said . " So once they figure out that one 's a fake , they 're going to come back to the gallery and ask questions . " Tilda felt her stomach twist again . " They might look at all the paintings Grandpa sold them for thousands of dollars and find out that some of them are fakes , and they 're going to want their money back , and we do n't have it . And we could go to jail for that , too , and lose the gallery and this whole building which means we 'd all be out on the street . " " Wait a minute , " Nadine said , perking up , evidently undeterred by the news her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the gutter . " I did n't know it was a fake . The only person who knew it was a fake was Grandpa . So we 're off the hook . We can blame him . He 's dead ! " " That 's been pretty much my plan for the past five years , " Gwen said , still staring at the ceiling . " Nice try , but no , " Tilda said , feeling sicker . " The gallery as a business is still liable . And there 's one other person who knew and could go to jail . The person who painted them . " " Oh . " Nadine grew still . " Who painted them ? " " I did , of course , " Tilda said , and got out her inhaler again . IT HAD taken Davy Dempsey four days to track his ex-financial adviser from Miami , Florida , to Columbus , Ohio , and now he leaned in the doorway of a little diner and watched his prey pick up his water glass , survey the rim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aka Rabbit , was born to be the perfect mark : pale , semichinless , and so smug about his superiority in all things having to do with money , art , and life in general that he was a sure thing to con . Which made it doubly annoying that he had taken all of Davy 's money . Davy crossed the diner and slid into the booth , and Ronald looked up in mid-sip and then inhaled his water in one horrified gasp . " Hello , Rabbit , " Davy said , enjoying the gargle . " Where the hell is my three million dollars ? " ( Continues ... )
