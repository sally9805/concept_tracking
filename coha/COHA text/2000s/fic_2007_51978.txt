James Stoddaid published " The Stai Watch " in oui Jan. 2002 issue and " The Battle of York " in our All-American July 2004 issue . He lives in Texas and recently welcomed a giandson into the family . This story is in pat a tribute to two of Mi . Stoddard 's foimei students , both of whom woik for NASA as A/V technicians . THE AGE OF CONSCIENCE arrived on a Thursday evening in June , as Greg Stoll sat in the twilight on his front porch in a suburb of Houston . His house overlooked a small lake , and after work he liked to rest in his porch swing and watch the trees cast their long shadows across the water . Sometimes his wife , Michelle , sat with him , but on this particular evening he was alone , the swing gently creaking . The shards of the day remained with him , the myriad noises of the broadcast booth at NASA , where Greg worked as a video and audio supervisor , handling everything from interviews to launches to public relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original shuttle launch firsthand , and had been there ever since . It was a good job , easy in some ways , fun in others , but the last decade had been difficult . Budget cuts , personnel changes , mission failures , faltering morale ; sometimes it was hard to remain optimistic . Though his was a support position , he loved NASA . But the politics could be overwhelming ; in his position , he saw too much of it . The organization could do so much more if only everyone could forget their personal agendas , stick to the task , and just get along . As the sun fell below the horizon and the first stars came out , he remembered the taped interviews he had done with the crew of the ill-fated Columbia . He could still recall their bright , hopeful faces , their quick wit and ready smiles , some arrogant , some humble , all confident . It had been the same before the Challenger accident . He stared at the clouds , orange and pink with the setting sun - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brave souls , gone forever from the earth . Even as he watched the gathering gloom , his own thoughts desolate , something inside him abruptly lifted . A weight seemed to rise from the center of his chest . He gasped , the breath pouring immeasurably sweet into his lungs . Forever after , he would associate the sensation with the beauty of the clouds . In that moment , he understood , though several days would pass before he could totally comprehend his understanding/A great oppression had departed from him , one he had carried unknowing all his life . He understood . All the pain borne of his fifty-odd years , the misunderstandings , hurt feelings , slights , griefs , disappointments , the little agonies of living , fell from him . A tremendous sense of forgiveness overwhelmed him , for himself and for others . A love for everyone and everything suffused him , the kind of love he must have had as a small child . He felt abruptly whole . The experience came with rocket speed , a hundred thoughts and sensations pouring through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he found himself weeping in the porch swing overlooking the little lake , gasping sobs , crying as he had not cried since he was ten years old . Eventually , he fell silent , and a part of him recognized that his brain no longer rattled away as it had done for so many years , chugging along like a broken steam engine fueled by a thousand useless , random thoughts . The silence of a sanctuary , of a cathedral . The silence of peace . Night fell , a glorious night , the darkening of the sky , the shifting of the shades , the beating of the stars seen through the haze of the street lights . He had always appreciated a good night sky , yet this time was different . Now , he truly saw its splendor . At last , when the songs of the cicadas filled the air , he staggered to his feet . He had to tell his wife what had happened . He had to tell everyone ! Turning to his front door , he found all the lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bothered to turn them on . He hurried inside , calling several times before finding his wife upstairs , seated in a wooden chair , looking out the window . She turned to him , her face fit by the dull glow of the street lamps . She had always been beautiful ; now she looked holy , her eyes twin lamps , radiant with love . In wonder , he realized he must look the same . " Why did n't I ever see how incredible life is ? " she asked . He took her in his arms , rejoicing . Out of a lifetime of habit , they turned on the TV to see if they were the only ones . Mindless entertainments played , stories without meaning . Most of the news stations were off the air . One had a camera rolling on a news desk empty except for a woman sitting and smiling at her hands , half her face outside the range of the lens . Greg and Michelle went outside , intending to knock on their neighbors " doors , but people were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices . When the couple joined the crowd , everyone greeted them with a hug . Introductions were made all around , as if this were the first time they had met their neighbors ; despite having lived there many years , this was mostly true . People laughed and cried , but despite the festive air , Greg noticed how little anyone said , how little he said . There was too much going on in his mind . In their excitement , Greg and his wife stayed up late that night , falling asleep curled up together as they had when they were young . The next morning no one went to work . The world , as one , began a day of reflection . Greg spent the morning with Michelle . " I never appreciated you enough , " they told one another . They spoke of their early life together , the good and bad , and for the first time , looking at his wife , Greg truly understood what Yeats meant when he wrote But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it a dream ? " Michelle asked . " Will we wake up tomorrow and be the way we were before ? So ... limited ? " " It 's not that I feel any smarter , " Greg told her . " But I understand more . My thinking before was so . . . disturbed . The things I worried about . It was all so ... so - " " Evil , " Michelle said . The word hung in the air between them . " An old , unused term , " Greg said . " Out of date , I would have called it before . Never would have applied it to myself . I mean , I thought I was basically a good person . But there was so much selfishness , so many times when I was petty or cruel . " He called his daughter in California later that day . " I 'm sorry I was n't a better father , " he said . " I 'm sorry I was n't a better daughter , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They laughed and fell silent . " It 's like everything I ever blamed you for is gone , " she finally said . " Not that you were a bad dad or anything , but now I understand you did the best you could , for what we were then . " They talked about moving closer , so they could see each other more often . Afterward , Greg had a similar conversation with his son in Wisconsin . Throughout the day , by mutual consent , every television station remained off the air until six o'clock that evening when the President gave a message . For the first time in years , every station carried it ; for the first time in decades , everyone considered the business of the nation more important than The Home Shopping Network and reruns of Gilligan 's Island . Nor was it the same beleaguered man who had faced the cameras dozens of times before . His usually penetrating eyes were calm ; his face relaxed . He did n't read a speech ; he just talked . " Something has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Something wonderful . A New Reasoning . We do n't know how or why , and it will take time to understand the ramifications . There is much to be done . This is a new beginning . A great work lies before us . We will do it together . All of us . A world of us . " I have been duplicitous , - 1 will be duplicitous no more . I have been arrogant , - 1 will be arrogant no more . I have catered to private interests for the sake of personal power . From now on , I will put the good of the country ahead of my own concerns . " There is one thing you should know , " he ended . " Not a single weapon has been fired anywhere in the world since yesterday evening . " EVEN THOUGH he had the day off , Greg went to work on Saturday . He had a lot of ideas he wanted to share . When he arrived , he discovered nearly the entire staff had done the same . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for posterity . Abe Feinstein , the Director of NASA , addressed the audience . " Given the week 's changes , I think there are three questions we should ask . Number one : Is our work important , or should we petition Congress to eliminate NASA ? Two : If our work is important , have we been pursuing it in the best manner ? Three : If not , how should we change ? I want us to break into small groups , each no larger than ten , and discuss these questions . " With his crew 's hand-cams rolling , Greg walked among the participants , listening to them talk . Some were fellow workers he had once disliked ; one was a woman he had loathed . Now , he wondered how he could have ever felt that way . It seemed so unreasonable . " Greg , " a man told him , pointing to a chair . " You should be in on this . Join our group . " No one had ever asked Greg 's opinion on the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . Everyone in the group spoke softly , taking turns , considerate of one another . Though many were passionate , no voices were raised , despite differing opinions . Gone were the needs for attention , the rivalries , the childishness . People said what they meant . No offense was given ; none taken . They quickly agreed that the exploration of space was important . Curiosity , rather than being dulled by the New Reasoning , had been intensified . The old , child-like sense of wonder permeated the discussions , the thirst to see the marvels of the universe . It was decided that NASA must be managed in a new way , with greater freedom for input in all areas . Simple logic dictated the necessity to ask for increased funding . Greg drove home that night whistling . On Monday morning , several important announcements were made . The Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan dissolved the organization . Forty-seven terrorist groups renounced violence . People who had committed crimes began turning themselves in to authorities , overwhelming the resources of the penal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overflow for free until the courts could determine whether incarceration remained a social necessity . China recognized Taiwan as an independent nation . Israel and Palestine began serious peace talks . South American and Middle Eastern countries vowed to plow up their poppy fields . Major magazine publishers met with advertisers to determine whether the content of their periodicals was truly meaningful , resulting in a suspension of more than seventy-five percent of their offerings and a revamping of the remainder . With the drive for self - promotion extinguished , producers , directors , and actors walked away from movies made purely for profit . The studios agreed and tore up their contracts . The pharmaceutical , insurance , and healthcare industries began a series of talks with the World Health Organization , to discuss providing a standard of care for every citizen on Earth . Thousands of companies announced a restructuring of remuneration policies to provide more equitable salaries to their employees . Hundreds of CEOs voluntarily returned the bulk of their benefits . Bookstores noted a marked increase in the sale of poetry . A phrase appeared that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to otheis 01 youiself . On Tuesday , Greg realized the importance of silence . He had filled his life with the constant yammering of TV , movies , satellite radio , CDs , books on tape - anything to keep from thinking . Now he basked in the solitudes . No longer did he spend his time regretting the past or brooding over the future . The present surrounded him . He could finally appreciate happy moments without analyzing his own appreciation , without comparing it to the happy times of his childhood . To sit in a car and meditate became a joy . He drove slower , no longer in a hurry . So did everyone else , and the speed limit found its natural equilibrium at forty-five miles per hour on the freeway and twenty in the city . With the highways less dangerous , Greg contemplated riding a bicycle to work . On his way home that evening , he realized that though death and disease remained upon the Earth , he no longer feared either one . How strange that he ever had . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East had agreed to the joint Israeli/Palestinian peace plan . The United Nations voted unanimously to adopt democratic reforms and to abolish trade sanctions worldwide . Ending hunger by the end of the year became the international priority . A list was made of the key points of the treaties and resolutions , but no papers were signed . A country 's word had become its bond . In India , the people voted to eliminate the caste system . The lotteries closed after giving away their last few millions to people who donated the money to the food relief effort . Across the world , street people and those placed in institutions because of mental rather than physical causes awoke to sanity . Millions of alcoholics and drug addicts turned themselves in to treatment centers . By the second week , all weapons of war were abolished . Ben Thomas , Greg and Michelle 's next-door neighbor , appeared at their door at five that evening . " Greg , we 're having a block party tonight , to celebrate . You coming ? " " Would n't miss it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the neighborhood was in the streets . This was a different kind of party , a different type of revelry - quiet , joyous . Greg discovered he no longer needed a couple of beers to feel comfortable in a crowd . He could be himself . He said things that were meaningful , encouraging , or playful . He listened when others spoke . No one talked about the weather just for something to say . He noticed that people laughed more than they used to , but told fewer jokes . Humor itself had changed . The ironic or sarcastic did n't seem funny anymore . The idea of making fight of others seemed ludicrous . Earlier that week , with safety no longer an issue and energy conservation a priority , the city council had voted to discontinue using street fights . As twilight fell , everyone in the neighborhood sat in lawn chairs or on blankets in front of Ben Thomas 's place , to watch an event many had n't witnessed in over twenty years , a tableau some had never seen . They watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny , enormous suns appeared , and the children ooohed and ahhhed as if they watched fireworks . " There 's one ! " a little girl shouted . " I see another , " a little boy cried . " Awesome ! " a teenager said . " Daddy , " another boy said , " tell me about the constellations . " But no one knew the names of the constellations except Greg , so he pointed them out , one by one : the North Star , the Big and Little Dippers , the Teapot , Scorpio , the Swan , Hercules , the tiny Pleiades . He showed them the Milky Way and the planets ; he told them the distances , and his listeners - who had never cared before - sat riveted by the telling . When he was done , Greg and his neighbors lit candles and stood in a circle , looking up at the millions of stars , the great wheel passing overhead . We shall overcome , they sang . We shall oveicome someday . A time popularly called The Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rethinking their lives , hundreds of job categories either changed or ceased to exist . Psychiatrists , prostitutes , professional models , district attorneys , security guards - thousands had to find other work . The word policeman was changed to helper Most lawyers lost their clientele . Droves of people quit their jobs to find meaningful work , many moving from management to service industries - plumbers , electricians , carpenters . The Peace Corps and several other charity organizations soon had more volunteers than they could use . The economic restructuring was difficult at first , but many of those whose jobs had become obsolete joined either the World Hunger Organization or the World Housing Authority . " TV does n't interest me much anymore , " Michelle said . " They 're coming out with new programming , " Greg replied . " I read about it in the paper . Speculative series about what we might accomplish . History and Natural History . Game shows without prizes . Puzzle shows . And the camera shots are going to be a lot slower . " WITH NO CONCERNS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunger Organization , powered by farmers " wheat donations from Kansas to the Ukraine , soon announced it had enough distribution centers in place to feed the world . Millions volunteered to give twenty percent of their income for the construction of basic housing . The standard of living in the developed countries dropped slightly , as its citizens rid themselves of things they had once considered necessities , the status symbols of neighborhood and nation . The automobile and petroleum industries retooled . Radical engine designs , uncovered in corporate vaults , were put into production . The car , no longer a symbol of prestige , became both more functional and more beautiful . The popularity of public transportation soared . With profits a secondary concern , measures were taken to protect the environment . A plan was implemented to end strip mining within three years . Socialism resurfaced , a system too idealistic for a selfish people . The European Union decided that people were responsible enough to use only the supplies , food , and clothing they needed , and to work to support the public good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abolish currency . Within two months , the other nations followed suit , and the strange , abstract system of monetary compensation that had ruled the world for so long was finally laid to rest . A short ceremony was held as the New York Stock Exchange closed for the final time . At NASA , Greg began to see big changes . The world 's resources , no longer required to wage war , were turned to research and public works . Materials poured into the space agency ; countries shared knowledge indiscriminately . More importantly , people 's minds were finally free . Greg no longer wasted time on company politics and personal animosities . The joy of his career filled him , the play of handling the NASA broadcasts . Mistakes were made , but easily forgiven , both by his bosses and his own conscience . There were no misgivings . Projects proceeded at astonishing speed . Given full range of their imaginations , NASA dreamed big . In an astounding breakthrough , a group of physicists in Zurich discovered a method to overcome Einstein 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientists for half a century were suddenly solved - ships 's weight , shielding , propulsion , the health of the crew . Plans were drawn to build an interstellar craft . Across the world , the AIDS epidemic began to abate , as concern for others overcame all other considerations . New vaccines appeared . Unwanted pregnancies dropped to zero , reason finally overcoming the drive for procreation . To reduce overpopulation , everyone agreed that couples should have no more than two children . Families that wanted more children adopted from the dwindling numbers in orphanages . The pace of life slowed , yet more was accomplished . Through no edict , the work day gradually diminished to six hours , with a one hour lunch . More people began to garden . On the second anniversary of the New Reasoning , millions gathered in New York City , at the site of the Memorial Museum erected to commemorate the destruction of the World Trade Center . Former members of terrorist organizations were in attendance . The centerpiece of the ceremony was the bronze sculpture entitled The Sphere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band was added to the piece , with the words of Martin Luther King , Jr . inscribed upon it . Fiee at last ! Free at last ! Thank God almighty , we are free at last ! In the fifth year of the New Reasoning , Greg sat at the mixing console at the broadcast facility at NASA , watching a sleek , white ship preparing to launch . The unmanned test flights had gone well . He smiled . This was to be a short flight to Proxima Centauri , the closest star . How he would have laughed if anyone had called it that five years before . He had spent the last month taping interviews of the seven person crew , another group of bright , hopeful astronauts about to take the trip of a lifetime . He thought again of the recordings of the Challenger and Columbia crews . Once , such memories would have evoked only sorrow . But not today . Death was part of life ; the sacrifices had not been in vain . No sacrifices were ever in vain . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid . Fear was in the past . As the numbers rolled down and the engines began their roar , Greg adjusted the volume on his monitor feed , smiling down at the faders . " Now , " he whispered , " we 're ready . "
