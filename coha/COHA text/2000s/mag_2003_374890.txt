One week into the war , the Commander in Chief was on edge . Appearing before reporters with British Prime Minister Tony Blair last Thursday , George W. Bush let loose a double dose of presidential petulance . He fidgeted , he frowned , and he scowled at questioners . At one point Bush spoke over Blair as the Prime Minister tried to answer a question . Bush 's temper had grown short , aides said , because doubts about the war 's progress were growing just when Bush was trying to get out a message of resolve . Reports of Iraqi irregular forces harassing U.S. troops up and down the road to Baghdad  --  faking surrenders , springing ambushes , firing from commuter buses  --  had not made him rethink his war . What the President wondered about instead was his message . Why was n't it getting through ? He asked his aides what had become of all the leaflets being dropped on the Iraqi people and the radio messages beamed their way urging them not to fight for a dying regime . Did the Iraqis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relent until Saddam Hussein was dead or captured ? Said an aide , " There is this concern that the Iraqis think we wo n't finish the job . " <P> With each new report of an atrocity by the Iraqi regime  --  a woman hanged for waving at a coalition soldier , a nine-year-old boy shot because his family refused to cooperate with Saddam 's forces  --  the President grew more anxious to repeat his message . " Resolve , " said a senior Bush aide . " That 's what people who have loved ones who are POWs want to hear . That 's what the guys in the field who are fighting this thing want to hear . And he is going to hammer it home and hammer it home and hammer it home . " So when Bush was finally asked at the press conference whether the war would " last months , not weeks , " he could barely wait for the question to be completed . " However long it takes to win , " he shot back . Moments later he repeated the pledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long . It takes . " <P> It was a revealing moment . Clearly Bush meant to remind the world of his determination to finish off Saddam 's regime , but his impatient tone simultaneously underscored that the task was proving more difficult than many had anticipated . The allied wave of steel pushing into Iraq had been slowed by sandstorms and guerrilla attacks . Civilian casualties were adding up . Having apparently survived the U.S. 's first-day attempt to kill him , Saddam seemed to be in command .
