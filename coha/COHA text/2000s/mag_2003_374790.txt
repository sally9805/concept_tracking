Bill Wilson , a stockbroker and a drunk from Brooklyn , N.Y. , thought he had found the secret of kicking the bottle . But on a business trip to Akron , Ohio , in May he found himself outside a bar , tempted and desperate . In the past , he had fought the urge by talking to other alcoholics , who truly understood his struggle . Through a church group , he found local surgeon Robert Holbrook Smith . <P> Dr. Bob and Bill W. , as Alcoholics Anonymous members know them , promised to keep each other sober , following Bill W. 's strategy : a simple set of principles  --  later refined into 12 steps  --  that would become the foundation of America 's self-help culture . Alcoholics , he said , must admit they are powerless over their addiction . They must make amends to all those they have harmed . And they must submit to God  --  however they define the deity . <P> The advice did not immediately take . Dr. Bob went to Atlantic City , N.J. , for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Akron train station , smashed . On June 10 , the dried-out but still jittery doctor was due in surgery . That morning , Bill W. gave Dr. Bob a bottle of beer  --  to steady his scalpel hand . The operation was a success . The beer was Dr. Bob 's last . And the two men pledged that day to work to bring Bill W. 's principles to other alcoholics , one day at a time .  --  By James Poniewozik
