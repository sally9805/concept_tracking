Unpicturable beings are realized , and realized with an intensity almost like that of hallucination . They determine our vital attitude as decisively as the vital attitude of lovers is determined by the habitual sense , by which each of us is haunted , of the other being in the world . <p> - WILLIAM JAMES , The Varieties of Religious Experience <p> 1 . Of course , there were many reports , as might be expected in a case like this . <p> 2 . Some say narrative ended with Borges . I sometimes believe that , and though the business of online blogs and the lovely young woman in New York with emerald eyes and lustrous auburn hair who kept a very personal one figures into much of this , as good a proof as any of the larger phenomenon of narrative 's ending , still , there 's no avoiding Borges on the matter . <p> 3 . Interestingly enough , a fact exists about him , documented by several sources , but not contained in any of the several available biographies , in English , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Borges : A Literary Biography , New York , 1978 ( quite good , actually , well-researched and heartfelt , even if it is dated , written by a Uruguayan who knew and understood the man , was even on a first-name basis with Borges 's rather stuffy mother , who largely controlled her bachelor sons life and so much longed to have her lineage recognized , have her son be thought of as an Argentine aristocrat ) ; and James Woodall 's The Man in the Mirror of the Book , London , 1996 ( also surprisingly good , with a lot of zip to it , as you might expect , it being written by a British journalist , and he catches some of the many slips that will occur in a first biography like Rodriguez Monegal 's , little things , such as the fact that Borges always claimed that when Pern took over in 1946 and Borges lost his modest position that supported him-a job as an assistant at a branch library in a leafy but grim Buenos Aires suburb-he was transferred as a cruel joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the position of Chief Inspector of Poultry and Rabbits at the Calle Crdoba Marketplace , when , in actuality , the post that Borges was assigned to-and , naturally had to refuse , therefore losing any means of support-was simply Chief Inspector of Poultry , B. adding the " Rabbits " in embellishment and that suddenly becoming fact in itself , picked up by commentators on the Argentine master for many years ) ; and Edwin Williamson 's very recent Borges : A Life , London , 2004 ( truly terrible , written by somebody who is identified on the otherwise handsome jacket provided by the publisher-a bold aqua-and-yellow border , encasing a sepia photo of an older Borges in a fine British-tailored suit and looking in his blindness suitably metaphysically startled , as the camera catches him staring up from a big writing desk-yes , Williamson , identified there as the " King Alfonso XIII Professor of Spanish Studies at the University of Oxford and Fellow of Exeter College , " delivers the clunky and almost too-detailed account of the life , spanning nearly six hundred pages and sounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less a massive sophomore lit paper gone somehow wrong through the usual earnest drudgery of beating to death some flimsy thesis , in this case arguing that Borges 's short stories , which were , in fact , anything but autobiographical , were , in fact , very autobiographical and largely the product of his sexual frustration , biographer Williamson obscenely going on and on with it in turgid , fully laughable line-byline analysis in that vein , though what was very entertaining was David Foster Wallaces brilliant review in the New York Times Book Review bombing the biography , frankly calling it essentially dishonest , and then a whiny and typically testy letter of the sort you would expect from anybody called the King Alfonso XIII Professor of Spanish , pompously defending himself and personally attacking Wallace and his own actually fine fiction ; the letter was printed in the NYTBR the next week ) . <p> To repeat , this often referred-to fact of Borges 's life turns up in none of those three books , though so many people , orally and in print , speak of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , Borges could never sleep in a bed from which he could see a mirror . True , the Argentine masters lifelong fear , bordering on phobia , about mirrors has been well documented , and how often it is indeed found in the poems , essays , and stories , the way he suspected that the ultimate horror of mirrors was that they tossed back our watery , surely ghostly sense of self , or repeated us to the point that we did n't know who exactly we were , if , as it turns out , we are anybody at all . To avoid this problem at his own home , the apartment where he lived most of his long life as a bachelor with his widowed mother on Calle Maipu in Buenos Aires , was quite simple . Actually , Borges 's room was the smaller of the two bedrooms in the place , what photographs of the apartment show as almost a monks cell containing a tiny iron-framed bed with a cross over it and a single dark-wood bookcase-no mirror , of course , in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oriental carpets and certainly more than one mirror was not only his mother 's room during her long lifetime , but the same even after she died ; Borges kept it exactly as she had left it , seemingly a shrine to her , as he himself , aging and increasingly going blind and with pearl-handled walking cane in hand , would enter the apartment after an evening out and in the dark never fail to say aloud , " Mother , I 'm home . " No , the problem with the mirrors was n't a matter of his life at home , but it was entirely a matter of so much of his later life spent traveling , when at last the world discovered him ; suddenly in the age of jet travel , Borges was celebrated on a global scale as no serious writer had ever been celebrated before . Tokyo , Cambridge ( Mass . ) , Paris , Mexico City , San Antonio , Jerusalem , Madrid . It made no difference where it might be , and the blind Borges would be escorted into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform with gold epaulets , lets say , Borges would poke around a bit with the cane and ask where the mirror was , then have that captain summon several more bellboys in maroon uniforms with gold epaulets , lets also say , to wrestle with and yank the big tortoiseshell furniture until they had the configuration right . <p> Without the mirror visible , Borges could sleep in whatever foreign city he found himself in-horns blaring lonely in the black night the way they do in a foreign city , strange voices overheard hauntingly in the nighttime hallways of a hotel , the way they are overheard in the hotel of a foreign city-sleep very comfortably after lecturing or simply being , indeed , internationally celebrated once more , knowing that he could not see a mirror from his bed and , more sobecause , after all , he was blind-knowing that the silvery slab could not see him . <p> 5 . Or , to put it more exactly , so the mirror could n't see him dreaming , dreams being a mirror of reality , and mirrors being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment and think about it . It was then that the idea of narrative ended , no ? <p> 7 But there are other reports , other theories . <p> 8 . I mean , think some more about the whole topic yourself . There was a time you saw a stranger on the street who reminded you of somebody you had never known , and narrative for all intents and purposes ended . <p> 9 . Or , there was a nail puzzle-chromed ten-penny nails , twisted together-and you held it in your hands and got ready for your most nimble dexterous assault , staring at the thing and studying it hard , before starting what you were sure was going to be a complicated project-and then it just loosened as easily as that , one chrome ten-penny serpentine nail with a round flat head in one hand , and - another chrome ten-penny serpentine nail with a round flat head in the other hand , and you were quietly startled , half jarred , to see them come apart without even any working to render them free , shed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you said to yourself , yes , " Narrative has ended . " <p> 10 . Also , before going on , I myself have been thinking about that business with Borges . I have been thinking that what he certainly knew was very true : that mirrors in waking life are one thing , where as protected and at least relatively safe as you try to believe that you are in the blue-skied , cloud-tumbling sunshine ( be careful not to step on your dark shadow , always knock on mahogany ) , the old routine of the so-called routine , the rumored day-to-day straightening your tie to look OK with a brave face , checking that the slip is n't showing beneath the hem of your good dark green dress , yes , in waking you always know , or knew , as Borges knew , that all that fragile-and supposed-safety is nothing and it simply disintegrates when up against the utter horror of a mirror watching you sleep , or , as said , dream . For Borges that was ultimately it : The whole undermining of narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when sleeping , stories each of us drifts through that , in Truth , are not stories at all , are hot the recounted or narrated , because while dreams are actually transpiring they are as real as anything else , and to think of a tarnished , purple-and-gold iridescent mirror with its own reality watching that , questioning all of that , mirroring the mirroring that actually is n't mirroring , if you will , and ... and ... but enough of that tack , except to say , what Borges knew was that narrative had no other choice but to , well , end . <p> 11 . OK , look at it another way . <p> 12 . Once , in a bar , this guy sitting on the stool next to me was looking at me . <p> It was somewhere around Ninth Avenue or possibly close enough to it , the Theater District proper . ( I do n't want to be too specific here , so take your pick : It could have been the sleek , crisp-table-clothed West Bank Bar , downstairs in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of pals of mine living there-some job-to-job actors and one struggling playwright-and even if the West Bank is pretty upscale , those theater people who barely get by financially do often tend to drink in the place ; or it could have been the dump just down Ninth Avenue , Rudy 's , free hot dogs grilling behind the bar and duct tape on the upholstered booths , the glowing jukebox playing such loud sixties and seventies stuff , like the theme from Shaft or whatever ; or it could even have been Sardi 's with its famous rust red walls splattered with black-framed pen-and-inks of theater notables , maybe there in the cozy bar at the front , where the sunlight late in the afternoon in winter comes through the slatted old Venetian blinds in zebra stripes , dust motes suspended like little stars in the all but empty nook , and the bartender , Tommy from Flatbush , in his proper white jacket knows that it 's good that at least a few everyday people like me come into otherwise legendary Sardi 's , and a bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd pay most anywhere else in the Theater District . ) I was sitting there at the bar in one place or the other , and the guy kept glancing over at me , a guy in good shape and probably in his late thirties , with longish dark hair , wearing a tweed sport jacket , open-collar dress shirt , and jeans ; he finally just spoke to me , almost as if I knew what he was thinking , or at least would be interested in what he was thinking . <p> " It threw me for a loop , you might say , " he pronounced aloud . <p> " Excuse me , " I said . <p> " It really , really threw me for a loop . " <p> That 's how it began . We talked a little as we drank at the bar , exchanged lines on routine stuff , and then he got back to what he really had to say . <p> " She was something else , coming along just when I had nearly given up on any relationship with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some luck with it , and there were always plenty of women , sort of artists ' groupies , and there was one marriage , but none of it worked out , as I said , very well . " <p> The way I think I understood it was that the affair started rather randomly , a chance meeting . It happened on the subway platform when he helped her pick up some books and such she 'd had in a loop-handled shopping bag , yellow , that broke ( he was specific about the color of the bag ) , and they got to talking and laughing , and she gave him her cell phone number in the course of it . Before she even got a call from him , she apparently had gone to a gallery in Chelsea to see some of his paintings , and when they did meet for drinks and dinner , they were so enamored with one another that there was lovemaking back at his place that very evening , just before he had to go to London to help set up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe for that week , there were some long-distance calls , each of them saying how much he or she missed the other , each of them saying how he or she had never met anybody quite like the other . He explained she was somewhat younger than him , only twenty-seven , but he was n't so much older that there was anything really off about it , it was all within reasonable range , a dozen years ; he said he was thirty-nine . And he emphasized it was n't just her attractiveness , but other things , too . <p> " Not to play down the fact she was attractive , " he said . " Tall and with good posture , slim and small breasted , with that lustrous auburn hair , like I said , and really emerald eyes , skin very white . Even if her teeth were a bit buck , or the front two of them sort of hinging toward each other rather than flat so you noticed it , but that , too , was somehow right , sort of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she smiled a lot , beamed , really , with a such a lovely white smile , sort of bobbing her head as she did it , sort of seeming like she was more or less happy as all hell . Which was wonderful , buoyant , but even that was n't it . It could have just been something shared at first , and now that I think of it , maybe it was that we had Africa in common . " <p> " Africa ? " I asked him . <p> " I had put in a confused couple of years in the Peace Corps in Sierra Leone , which , if nothing else , is where I learned I really wanted to paint . Just the whole visual explosion of beautiful Africa , color like you have never seen before , the sheer wallop of the oozing honey sunshine making everything in Africa , no matter how shabby it is-the rutted red dirt roads , the spilling green vegetation , the scrurfily happy people sometimes in close to rags of all sorts of wild colors-that sunshine put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just seeing it convinced me I should pursue my painting seriously when I returned home . She had lived in Africa herself , Cameroon , and her father was a career man in the foreign service and was stationed there in Cameroon the longest . Her mother had died when she was only seven and she , like her sister before her , was sent to a swank boarding school in Switzerland , not because she was rich , but because tuition payment was a perk her father got for being in the foreign service . Nevertheless , she always spent summers in Africa , loved it , told me that she loved how I obviously had loved Africa , too . She made me remember things about Africa . She talked to me of how the political thugs in Cameroon bought cheap splashy-print dashikis with a photo of the strongman head of state silk-screened on the front , the way thugs in every sub-Saharan African country-including Sierra Leone-always bought dashikis like that to try to play up to whatever strongman head of state there was in their own country at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wear them themselves as kids just because they thought the big things were ultra cool . She talked to me about trips she and her sister would take on their own to villages far from Yaounde , the Cameroon capital , backpacking together in the summer , and she laughed to remember how the women who were prone to motion sickness and rode with you in those so-called mammy wagons , the little Toyota vans painted crazily and what passed for long-distance transportation in Cameroon , those women always brought their lidded old cocoa tins for any journey , to politely regurgitate into them for an entire sweating , twelve-hour trip through the winding hillside roads , that itself a something wonderful about Africa , too . I had seen the same in Sierra Leone , how polite the women were about it , how also completely dignified they were about it , ladylike , and she made me remember that . I will be honest . I missed her terribly when I was in London . We laughed a lot on the phone , and we laughed a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the exhibit and I got put up at the Commander hotel . " <p> " On Forty-eighth Street ? " I asked him . <p> " Exactly . Right there on Forty-eighth , across from the Longacre Theater . " <p> " And you were in love ? " <p> But he did n't quite answer that , only said : <p> " You know , I did n't like the fact that she smoked , and not to get too far ahead of myself , but that could have been the clue , or what produced the clue signaling the mess that ensued . And I 'll get to what happened in the deli when I was with her , buying a simple six-pack of plain old red-and-white cans of Budweiser , and she did what she did regarding the pack of cigarettes , which maybe was a very big clue , or maybe it 's all I have to go on now , I suppose . <p> " Anyway , she would come to see me at the Commander hotel after she got out of work there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and catalogs , which was probably why she dressed as well as she did , chic and quietly classy clothes . I guess I should have filled in the fact that for her senior year she went to a prep school in Philadelphia , again on the state department tab , an Episcopal operation that she loved , her taking the last year there to make college application easier , rather than doing it from the boarding school in Switzerland . Then she did her undergrad work , an English major , at University of Arizona in Tucson , which she said was sort of an ongoing vacation , not very academic whatsoever , and she admitted that she should have spent a little more time thinking about where to apply . She said she went there only because a bunch of kids from the prep school in Philadelphia had gone or were going there , probably seeking escape from the northeastern deep freeze that she really did n't need to escape , having spent so much time in Cameroon . Anyway , you know how that is , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Of course , " I said , wondering where he was going with this . " Of course . " <p> I mean , what else could I say ? <p> I ordered another beer , and I did let this guy go on-and on , I suppose . <p> 13 . It seems that while he had been in London , the landlord for the apartment he leased in one of those blood-red brick tenements of which some still do exist on Ninth Avenue , not yet falling prey to the vicious yuppification of the whole old Hell 's Kitchen neighborhood , had to start tearing walls out to go after a gas leak . The landlord had insurance that would put the few residents up in hotels for a while , and this guy at the bar who was entirely enamored with the young woman ( listening , I thought that was a good word for it , " enamored " ) decided to just go over a couple of blocks on Forty-eighth Street to the Commander , a good yet older midrange place where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a corner one on the Eighth Avenue side , with a balcony , no less . And from that balcony he could see , then in summer , clear over the office buildings and the tenements , plus the puffs of feathery green treetops here and there , right to the Hudson , even see the huge , top-heavy white cruise ships easing in and out of the couple of piers still used by cruise ships there . He would paint in his studio in a converted industrial garage over on Eleventh Avenue , then come back to the room high up in the Commander , take a nap with the windows and the doors to the balcony wide open , the sounds of taxis honking and trucks grinding through gears far enough below that it was almost distant and lulling . <p> " You know what I mean , the noise being rather pleasant , " he said to me . <p> " I suppose I do , " I said , " kind of like distant surf , or maybe a thunderstorm rumbling a couple of towns over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant noise can be lulling . " <p> " That 's it exactly . " He looked right at me . " You seem to be following me on all of this . " <p> I nodded . <p> " Lets say I painted well this day , " he said . " Let 's say I felt good , and taking a nap like that , the drapes almost breathing in and out in the easy cadence of it all , it was all a most pleasant matter of sleeping some and waking some , still dressed and stretched out on the maroon floral print of the bedspread , knowing that soon enough I would hear a knock on the door , knowing that soon enough this tall , beautiful woman would materialize , smiling , softly laughing . We would sit around at the Commander and talk , usually out on the balcony , before having dinner somewhere , sit around and talk some more at the Commander later with maybe a few beers bought at a delicatessen , soon enough making love and then relaxing and just lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some more , which was always the very best part . We were well beyond that first stage in a relationship where you savor what you have in common , like Africa , basking in that , and now we basked in talking about everything . We talked about small things , art we liked , movies we liked , books we recently read . We talked about serious things , like the big sadness of my own divorce , which I survived , and the bigger sadness , surely , of her own mother dying of cancer when she was only seven , it happening when her father had been assigned to Jamaica . She told me , very seriously , that at first it seemed to have had more of an effect on her sister , eleven then , than on her at seven , and she herself had been really too young to realize the import of it , not knowing then that for her it would mean a life of being sent away to schools , and not knowing then that she would have the predictable teenage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjust to having a stepmom , especially after she and her sister were used to having their father all to themselves for so many years . Once , lying there naked together , the view from the bed and through the open balcony doors showing only big piled-up summer clouds igniting in all unheard-of pastels for a sunset there above what must have been New Jersey , she admitted how she had finally realized , years later , that maybe her mother dying so young probably had more of an effect on her than she had any chance of knowing as a kid , and even lately she kept having the same dream that she had had for years , what really told the story . In it she repeatedly found herself seven years old again , wandering out of the bungalow her father was given as a consular section staffer there in Kingston , Jamaica . She simply kept looking at the flowers , maybe cascading bougainvillea and giant , fleshy wild orchids , she kept staring at the sea , no sense of her mother gone but knowing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder why ? The sea does n't either . ' I was always and very simply happy to be with her there in the Commander hotel , happy to the point that for me it was half unreal . <p> " In truth , " he said , " it reminded me of that often quoted line from Borges-you see , I do a lot of reading myself , have always liked Borges-that line where he says that we accept reality so easily , so readily , maybe because we suspect that nothing is real . " <p> " Borges ? " I asked him . <p> " Yeah . Like I said , I 'm a painter , but like I also said , I read an awful lot , too . " <p> I got a little nervous thinking to try on him what I did try on him next , but it was as if I had no choice : " Do you know that thing about Borges and mirrors in his hotel rooms ? " <p> " What ? " He spoke that as if to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Forget it , OK ? " I told him . " And to get back to what you were saying-that you were in love , right ? " <p> 14 . But again he balked at answering directly , and after so much buildup from him , what did eventually happen , the pivot , came rather fast , the way he filled everything in for me there at the bar . <p> Apparently , for the month or so this relationship went on in New York , it mostly involved weekday evenings together . Very busy , he was painting as hard as he could because they wanted a few more canvases for the gallery exhibit in London , were expanding it . Also , there was the element of geography , and with her living over in Williamsburg in Brooklyn-as the latest influx into the city of people that age , twenty-somethings , inevitably live in Williamsburg , inevitably think it defines hipness , the urbanly exotic for them , I guess-that meant that most of their time together was spent there around the Theater District , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking to work down around Herald Square from the Commander in the morning . In short , he really did n't know much about her life over there in Williamsburg . <p> And not to preface it anymore myself , what eventually happened was that he discovered she had a blog on the Web , a very personal one , to put it mildly . <p> It seems he was in the very same bar in which I was sitting next to him now ( the more I think about it , I think I can say it was the West Bank ) , and he ran into an old pal of his who was a literary agent . As the painter told the old pal about what could only be called , as said , his current enamorment , talked about a girl who grew up all over the world and went to boarding school in Switzerland and now lived over in Williamsburg , commuting from there to her job in Manhattan as a fashion copy editor , the young woman he was currently seeing , the agent said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound like this blogger who goes by the online name Kiddlet . " Yes , the situation was that this agent-always looking for new literary talent and hopefully the chance to rescue himself from his own problems with alimony from two marriages , dig himself out via a trendy blockbuster sale to some huge and impersonal publishing house that was only interested in another trendy blockbuster sale-this agent lately had his young assistants in the office keep tabs on the Web on some of the better personal blogs they got word on . Apparently , a very successful , really big-time agent had discovered a young writer who recently got a huge book contract on the basis of her confessional blog that had developed a wide net following , and every other agent was trying to cash in on the phenomenon , coattail it . The more the agent told the painter about what he had read from this so-called Kiddlet , the more it did , in fact , sound rather all too familiar to the painter . Not that the agent had thought the stuff would work as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did have verve , he said , or an engaging offbeat voice , wonderfully observant ; he said that his assistants , young people and all Internet junkies , showed him so many of these diary blogs , and he still had n't found one with the right writing or material that would make him want to contact the person to see if there might be a novel or book of some variety in it . <p> " Actually , I had to fly back to London to finish setting up the exhibit , " the painter said , " and it was the night before I left that I talked to the agent friend . And later that night , back at the hotel , the Commander on Forty-eighth , I typed in the words ' Kiddlet ' - an invented word in itself , so it was entirely unique-and ' blog ' into Google , and I came up with it . I mean , how should I put this , sure enough I came up with it . " <p> He shook his head , troubled . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful . <p> ( Note Numeral 14 has just been repeated here , but considering that numeral 10 got x-ed out-a bit muddled , that section-it seems to me that an extra numeral and section need to be inserted to make up for it , not so much a tribute to narrative consistency as just adherence to basic chronology , no ? ) <p> 15 . " I 've never been much of a computer guy , " he confessed , " especially as a painter protecting my space and lately refusing to deal even with having e-mail , even a cell phone , if you can believe it . If somebody has to get in touch with me , I have my dealers and gallery people to handle it . I do n't think I 've ever lost anything by not having all that noise assaulting me all the time . In fact , I think I 've gained a whole lot , protected that space well . I can get in touch with whoever I want , but it 's tougher for anybody to get in touch with me-the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you know what I mean . I did n't even know much or care much about these so-called blogs , yet I suppose I knew there were political blogs and literary blogs and sports blogs , most bloggers playing sort of an online game , I guess , getting a measure of celebrity with a made-up name , like an old CB radio handle , or , more exactly , getting a pretend or virtual celebrity , at least among the couple dozen or so blogger pals who read their posts , comment on them , chatroom style . But these personal blogs , maybe lifestyle blogs , I guess were the strangest , and quite popular , and I read around and found others that Kiddlet 's linked me to . But that was later , while this night I just clicked the mouse , looked at the screen of my overpriced silvery Mac PowerBook G-4 laptop there at the little mahogany dresser/desk in the pink-wallpapered room high up in the Commanderthere was AirPort-card connection there , very reliable-and I got Kiddlet 's blog . It had graphics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dark blue , the letters themselves sort of stars in the sky , Kiddlet 's blog itself titled , ' The Now of the Now of It , ' which could have come from Beckett , I 'm not sure . To put it mildly , or frankly , I can tell you there was no doubting that this was the woman I was seeing , I mean , it did n't take any detective work , computer forensics , and my agent buddy was smack on target with the admittedly very chance association . " <p> " You sure you never thought about what I mentioned concerning Borges , " I asked him , " not just that this sounds Borgesian , but especially that thing he had about mirrors in hotel rooms ? You 've heard of that , no ?

" <p> " Can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he ordered a next one for himself . <p> " Sure , " I said . <p> 16 . Apparently , he started reading entries , documentation of Kiddlet 's life as a freewheeling twenty-seven-year-old woman in the city . And it was n't so much that she had been dishonest about anything with him-they had spent enough time together already that they had talked a lot about their past , exchanged intimaciesbut this was all too intimate , all too revealing . Just a few recent entries , without even dipping into the archives that were catalogued with little white Roman numerals below on the achingly glowing dark-blue page ( he was very specific , definitely the painter in him ) , was enough to convince him that he had merely imagined who she was , maybe the way he wanted to envision her , be enamored with her , and her real life there in Williamsburg and its environs was obviously dramatically different . He said the whole thing would have been comical , almost another lousy TV sitcom episode premise , a giant laugh , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . <p> " I 'll confess , I had fallen in love with her , the way you do fall in love without ever daring to say it , let alone to the other person but even to yourself , and you just have certain attitudes that suggest the utter airiness , the total selflessness of love . I suppose I already cared about her the way you do when you truly love someone , and , I mean , even if she was n't sure just how much she had been affected by her mother dying like that when she was seven , I knew that whenever I was with her that that fact itself , how she had been left alone at that age , broke my heart , to think of her as a child being sent off on her own to schools from whatever country her father was assigned to at the time , and I wanted to protect her from all of that sort of pain in the world .

That and the truth that William James has argued for in that wonderful tome of American tomes , Varieties of Religious Experience-such a dark , revealing book , such an essentially haunting and ultimately transcendent book . One of his chief arguments for religion itself in the chapter called ' The Reality of the Unseen ' poses that to understand how the visionary and half-hallucinated can be , in essence , very real , is to call to mind the state of being in love , when you think of the other person all the time , when you have them in mind when apart , picturing them , hearing them , surely touching them in the imagination , to the point that any distinction between the real and the unreal melts , or maybe evanesces is the better way of describing it , because a word like ' melt ' entails too much suggestion of the physical .

And I think I had . " Or a passage close to exactly that from James . I 'm not kidding . As an epigraph of a short story or something . " <p> He adjusted the lapel of his sport jacket , ran his hand through the thick , longish dark hair . <p> " It 's a great observation , though , is n't it ? " was all he said . <p> Granted , for a painter he was definitely a reader , also not the usual sort of citizen you run into in idle conversation at any bar , even the sophisticated West Bank . But just as when I brought up the Borges business , or the ideas on strangers and nail puzzles and such , he did n't seem to respond , did n't make much out of my recognizing the William James quote either , when I mentioned having recently encountered it . He simply went on with the whole painfulness of discovering the blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the discovery happening the night before he was to fly back to London . <p> Actually , the evening before discovering it , he had been on the phone for a full hour with the young woman , saying their good-byes , and he sensed she was a little drunk , returning his call on her cell phone from a midtown bar where she had spent some happy-hour time with some people from work . Apparently , she whisperingly said in that conversation how much she missed him already , would miss him while he was away again , how she really wished he did n't have to go . She purred that she just wanted to spend forever and ever with the windows thrown wide open and the balcony doors thrown wide open way atop the clutter of Eighth Avenue-everybody hurrying in and out of the theaters , the handsome Hudson beyond-in the Commander hotel . She said all of that on the phone , and now at his computer , the painter saw how the most recent entry in the blog covered that very evening before and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , the painter , in the entry ) , true , later it seemed that after they spoke on the phone and she did take the L-train back to Williamsburg , she , as the hip voice of Kiddlet would have it , stopped by the apartment in Williamsburg of a friend named Alex " to smoke a quick bowl , " then headed out to a Williamsburg club called Catastrophe with him , to hear a blasting rock band that had some of his pals playing in it , the whole gang of them talking , laughing , talking all night , till after four in the morning when , totally drunk , they all had nightcaps behind closed doors after the place shut down , snorted a few lines . Who knows what happened with said Alex after that , and the painter explained that there was a highlight whenever the name " Alex " appeared in the text and you could click there to link to his own blog , which the painter did , to see a " Blogger Profile " photograph at the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the painter would have it , " right down to the muscle T-shirt , stiff mohawk , and enough heavy body jewelry to sink an aircraft carrier . " The painter did n't read on , he could n't read on , but as maybe the aforementioned Beckett would have it , he did read on , he could n't help himself , checking other recent entries , other adventures in the big city of Kiddlet , fashion copy editor in midtown by day and also-by night and on weekends , anyway-chain-smoking , pool-playing , bar-hopping wild child , yes , Kiddlet , seminotorious among her blogger pals , all of whose sites you could link to on her site . Kiddlet liked to booze and do drugs ( and not just some pot ; there seemed to be a lot , truly an awful lot , of cocaine , always called " blow " ) , and Kiddlet liked a lot of sex ( yes , she had told the painter about her early brushes with lesbianism , what had seemed just dalliance to him and understandably happening when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of it lingering into college in Arizona , but he had never expected that it was still very much part of a wholeheartedly bisexual menu , and there was an entire entry in the archive , a mini essay , about what she had been discussing with her " Chick of the Moment " on the innate sensual beauty of the melodically polysyllabic word " cunnilingus , " which Kiddlet held not enough people used anymore ; there was one very excited-and for the painter painful-recent entry on some gymnastics with the " Two Croatian Guys " she had met in a club one evening , " an awesome , awesome , awesome nite even by the standards of your not-so-humble correspondent Kiddlet ! " and an equally enthusiastic series of posts on her short-lived , but very satisfying , affair with a shy and quiet eighteen-year-old , " Beautiful Boy , " who she moved in on slowly , stealthily , as soon as she sighted him at a pool table at a Williamsburg bar , a first-semester freshman at NYU who , she sighed , was " tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make you wince " and presumably no slouch in bed , " Children , do you know how to saygreatl " being the direct quote , the punch line , on that aspect of his CV ) . There never seemed to be any real continuing relationships . Maybe worst-because , after all , booze and drugs and sex of whatever variety are surely a person 's own tastes and preferences , the painter said-was what appeared to be emerging as a markedly sleazy side to much of it , how she and one of her bar-hopping pals , another young woman who regularly prowled around with her , would cadge drinks while sitting at the bar , let 's say , at 3:00 AM from a bartender at a classier SoHo place , a guy who thought he had a chance with one or even the kinky twosome of them , how she and all her bar-hopping female pals liked to talk about how they regularly and drunkenly played plenty of other guys along at a lot of bars for free drinks and drugs , that kind of thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " the two of us sitting there outside on the hotel balcony , or in the same room where we had whispered such fragile intimacies so often , in the bruised purple dark , and after reading enough of that blog that night , I felt like a confirmed chump , not to put too fine a point on it . <p> " I started thinking about that scene in the delicatessen , when I stopped with her after dinner to pick up a six-pack of Bud , and that was early on in the relationship . I remembered the way that when I walked up to pay in the cramped , yellowlit place with all its bananas and all its canned peanuts there on Eighth Avenue , she simply said , offhand , that she needed cigarettes , she told the guy behind the counter who was ringing up the beer to give her a pack of Doral Lights , and she made some phony gesture of opening her shoulder bag as the clerk asked me if it was all together , with her then looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money ? ' to which I told her of course not . Yes , there was something about how she just expected me to pay for her cigarettes , or simply thought if she acted fast enough in the shuffle there at the deli counter , I would end up paying for them , sleazy . I could n't get that out of my mind now , and it made me think of other things , the way she kept saying that she would love so much to be with me in London during my opening , that she really did n't have the money for a ticket , but she would love so much if the two of us could be together there , for her to share with me the whole experience . She said she knew that already there was some buzz about the London exhibit , that I would be , well , celebrated somewhat when I eventually went back a third time for that officiai opening , and she said again how much she would like to go , that she had already checked the prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it might be great to do exactly that , she purred some more about how she did really , really wish she had the money to do it , and asked outright if I could pay for the trip for her . In fact , I knew she made pretty good money on that job she had , and when I joked that she did n't want me to degenerate into being a sugar daddy altogether , she responded by tightening her case more or less automatically , as if she was used to flatly saying it : ' There 's nothing wrong with a guy paying when he invites a girl somewhere , is there ? ' But I had n't really invited her . And that seemed sleazy , too . OK , OK , maybe I was reading into it , but it all compounded in my mind , beginning with the cigarettes episode , it all made a strange kind of sense , now that I had read her blog . She became something altogether different in my mind , whether she was in reality different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her out to be . And I felt taken , all right , I felt stupid , and , admittedly , I also felt more than a bit heartbroken , but having that other information about her , I knew where I stood , if nothing else . <p> " So I decided that this trip to London would make a good way to cut it all off naturally enough . I did n't call her from there this time , and I did n't return any of her calls , the messages she left at the hotel where I was staying , so it seemed she got the idea . And before long , in my apartment again on Ninth Avenue , I was back with a former lady friend , who I had a lot more in common with , anyway . I decided I would work to make that relationship work , and now I know how important hard work like that is in a relationship . No , she 's not all that much older than Kiddlet , but there 's a whole lot more depth there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a lawyer who spends most of her own free time and money with a group of other young lawyers who fly down from New York to the TexasMexico border together , working pro bono to cut through the red tape to allow street kids in Mexican places like Nuevo Laredo and Matamoros and Juarez get legal immigration status and then eventual adoption by American couples . She 's really brave about it , standing up to the tough Mexican police and government thugs , putting herself in real physical danger down there , and I 've come to realize how important , even altogether sexually attractive , social concern and rare bravery like that are in the world . " <p> 18 . But he still was n't finished . Because then " the other thing " happened . <p> 19 . He started to get scared of all the narrative that was out there , he said , those thousands and thousands of blogs , everybody talking , everybody crying the story of their lives and bellowing their opinions , everybody maybe lying , but who cared , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he admitted that the break with the young woman was n't as clean as he had portrayed it , and he did , in fact , when in London , go online to see what was in her latest blog entries . He knew , however , from the Web site for his own painting , which somebody had helped him set up , that anybody with a site could check who was visiting by using a simple tracker/counter or sitemeter , so he made sure that he protected against that . He read by accessing only Google 's cache pages , never her site itself , which meant he was only entering Googles site and could n't be tracked . Or-a safer method , he decided-he typed into Google as search words " Kiddlet " along with the date , to see if there was an entry that day , then he actually kept reading the best he could without visiting the site by incessantly typing into Google as search words the last few words of a sentence from the brief Google display of the hit , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next sentence , the painter reading that and then typing in the last few words of that sentence to produce in a search the next few words of the next sentence , the goofily frilled Google logo-red , yellow , blue , and green , with the big G-hovering atop the page and somehow belly-laughing at him . Reading like that-even if he felt sneaky doing it , obsessional and half stalkerish , surely out of character for him-he was constantly scared to see what he would find next , as he constructed the narrative , struggled with his own narrative force against the larger and prevailing antinarrative force , bit by bit , hit by hit . He was scared , too , when he entered in the Google search window " Kiddlet , " " The Now of the Now of It , " and various search words that turned up in the mind , representing his worst fears , or close to that , that might be lurking there in the archives of Kiddlet s past posts . Using quotes , he imagined more and more scenarios : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Now of It , " and " drunk " and saw seven Google search result pages and 68 hit entries ; he typed in " Kiddlet , " " The Now of the Now of It , " and " screwing " and saw a bigger list of fourteen pages and 136 entries ( removing the " ing " led to , among other things , " screw buddy , " what appeared to be a variation on " fuck buddy , " and in the same sentence there the term-apparently describing said companion , most glowingly- " super-hottie " showed a full three times ) ; he typed in " Kiddlet , " " The Now of the Now of It , " and not " coke " but that more colloquial " blow , " and there were eleven pages and no entries , the noun turned up in her blog archives that many times , all right . But , to repeat , he never actually entered-officially visited-the site again , he certainly did n't want her to know he was scouring it . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment on her . He repeated to me that her lifestyle was her own business , and he said you could argue there was a certain freewheeling exuberance to the blog that continued to speak an electric , youthful don't-give-a-damnism , very honest and very humorous and with an undeniably alluring urban hipster voice , as the literary agent had observed ; though it was also true that reading enough about such an iconic-or over the top-sex-and-the-city persona , with so much casual sex and so much drugging and sloppy drunkenness , complete with the occasional passing-out episode tossed in for good measure , could soon turn into a matter of dealing with what 's usually and maybe not too kindly known as just a-one has to utter it , but probably he himself was being spitefully mean in his hurt , the painter said- " bar skank . " The painter emphasized that I had to understand that this was somebody he had once been fantasizing about marrying , having children with one day . <p> " It was just that it was all not what I had expected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like those in my searches , or composing the sentences secretively , phrase by phrase , my stomach would jump , suddenly nothing but a den of slithering baby grass snakes . " <p> He also admitted to thinking back to the two of them there at the Commander and feeling sad . And sometimes he remembered something as simple as her smile and her happy laugh , those giant emerald green eyes , the prettily pouty overbite , and he got more than sad . But nervous and rattled all the while , too , to the point that he kept thinking more about blogs in general , he was overwhelmed with narrative , not just her escapades , but , again , all those stories of everybody out there , those thousands and thousands of bloggers , no , millions of bloggers , and he not only could n't read her blog or other blogs , he could n't read or think of reading anything for a while . Who knew anymore what was real writing , narrative had ended , and there was no story , no valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read for any of it to have any consequence , only absolute meaninglessness . He tried rereading his favorite books and could n't get past ten pages , Kerouac 's On the Road or Bellow 's Humboldt 's Gift or Ages Let Us Now Praise Famous Men ; and the words on the page all looked laughable , each book just another extended blog , leading nowhere , or if it did lead anywhere it would be the ultimate frightening destination , all right , where narrative must go , " Which was nowhere , " he said . And ... and ... <p> 20 . And I might as well admit it , I myself had gotten to the point that I could n't read much of anything I tried either , so for me " the other thing " had happened , too . <p> 21 . Narrative had ended . <p> 22 . The furniture had been rearranged , so to speak , no mirror could mirror life , or dreaming , for that matter . <p> 23 . I might as well really admit it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And I do n't think of the young woman much at all now . I am a writer , and making the writer a painter here , and making it all transpire in the course of a forced conversation in a bar , were attempts at narrative legerdemain , what a writer like me does , even if it did get clunky here with my having to do so much really forced explaining on why my painter was such an avid reader , why he could execute so many ( way too many ? ) literary allusions . However , like the painter , I myself did meet this twenty-seven-year-old woman when her yellow shopping bag broke on the subway platform , the young woman a.k.a . Kiddlet in her blog . I myself am thirty-nine years old , was in the Peace Corps in Sierra Leone , and it was there , after Dartmouth on a baseball scholarship , that I made the firm decision that I wanted to be not a painter but a writer , of course . I live now in what used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few times ( a rare chance to teach a writing seminar there and give what turned out to be a well-received public reading of my fiction , then the rarer chance to talk twice to a British publisher about reissuing some of my stuff ) , and though I was also actually displaced from my apartment on Ninth Avenue and , at my landlords expense , had to stay for a stretch in the Commander hotel-so often with her , after she got out of work as a fashionindustry copy editor-even truths like that are deceiving , facts to be manipulated for not always honest purpose , just more evidence of how vanished narrative is , how , lets face it and as already asserted , it goes nowhere , is nothing , does n't even have the chance of telling us anything significant because anybody is nobody , or nobody is anybody-or , yes , this is it , a beloved is n't what you imagined she was , and be careful of mirrors , when either waking or surreptitiously sleeping ; I suppose even my planting the quote from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epigraph and then having it referred to in the supposed ( do n't laugh ) narrative here , was and is more evidence of the ruinous duplicity afoot . <p> And it seemed as if for the world , not just me or the imaginary painter ( i.e. , me ) , yes , for the entire world narrative had ended , those smug French nihilists with their ton of language theory , any one of them pontificatingly lecturing while puffing a Gitane on the dais of the auditorium filled with other attentively listening French nihilists seated in the galleries and also puffing smelly Gitanes in that fine buff stone bastion of supreme nihilism , the Collge de France on rue des coles there in Paris ( lavender rain in Paris , strikingly brilliant sunshine in Paris , what does it matter ? ) , they were right all along . <p> 24 . Narrative had ended . There was heard the quiet , restrained , ever-so-smugly condescending patting of Gallic applause . <p> 25 . Narrative had really ended , imploded and then some . <p> 26 . Until something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happened . <p> On beaches , beaches all over this big , beautiful planet of ours-this place where the whole trick is to never lose sight of how special it all is , how it is all a matter of just so much precious oxygen , a finite amount , to be gulped and appreciated in these several dozen years any of us is allowed , at best , to inhabit it-on beaches everywhere people would be walking alone , possibly in winter on the empty sands , admiring the ocean , admiring the waves . Waves that kept rolling in sets . <p> Mesmerizing waves , the glassy rise of the blue crests veined with foam , the building and building and building , one after another , arching in sets , each wave getting higher and higher , promising the final explosion , the beautiful and thundering and half-heavenly sudsy crescendo of it all , waves that seemed to say things full of promise , such as , " That observation in Rodriguez Monegal 's biography of Borges is interesting , how Borges 's mother longed for acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That way that Borges embellished his own misfortune , saying that he was made inspector of Poultry and Rabbits , as addressed in Woodall s biography , is very interesting , tell me more , " and , " Granted the recent Borges biography by Williamson , the King Alfonso XIII Professor of Spanish at Oxford , is a prototypical clunker , still , nevertheless , that whole tale of Williamson attacking David Foster Wallace in the NYTBR is interesting in itself , please , please tell me much more . " Which is to say , the waves all over the world , on sandy beaches everywhere as stared at by lone figures , did promise so much as they built-they had n't , in fact , lost much of their essential power , inherent puissance . <p> 27 . The waves kept coming and coming . <p> 28 . Or , to put it yet another way , maybe narrative had n't ended , which is to say , has n't ended . <p> 29 . And , again , I can honestly say I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a while , when I do still remember that trading of stories we did , often after lovemaking , especially early on and about the marvels of dreamy Africa , what I knew and what she knew and what was quite special for both of us , something shared . I suppose I was hopelessly in love for at least a while then . I mean , I speak fluent French , and ( French intellectual nihilism aside ) I do n't know if I had ever been in an intimate relationship with a woman who could do the same-I guess I forgot to explain that sometimes we would speak French for a while just for fun , and a little thing like that can become very important . Also , I can say what really scared me was that there was never any mention of me in any of the blogging , during the whole while we saw each other and she reported faithfully on other events . It was as if I and my own being were n't there , for all intents and purposes did n't exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a , well , mirrory reflection , I suppose , as in that repeatedly mentioned business of Borges and his having the furniture moved around so he could n't see a hotel room 's mirror , which is , of course , something I made up , a completely fabricated fact constructed out of the thinnest of thin verbal air for the narrative ( or struggle to assert narrative ? attempt at the classic narrative , a very true love story ? ) that I offer you here . <p> Author Affiliation
