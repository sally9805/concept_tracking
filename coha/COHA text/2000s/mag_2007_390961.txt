Denis Johnson Killed the Sixties WITH TREE OF SMOKE , THE AUTHOR OF ANGELS ' LONG-AWAITED BIG BOOK FINALLY ARRIVES . FORTY YEARS LATE . BY TOM CHIARELLA WHEN IT COMES TO THE PAST , give it to me distant and pale . Herodotus , for instance . You ca n't really argue with the guy . City-states , swinging militarily from one end of the Aegean to the other , shapes of cultural movements described dryly and without dense moral hand-wringing . I like that stuff . By contrast , I 've had enough of the near past , which I find confining , clouded by layer upon layer of artistic reckoning , and chronically overtold . The significance of recent decades ticks itself down like oily rosary beads on a short chain of self-importance . We get so much of what we can already remember . Still , in times of war , the cultural muscle is to revisit the past . But what the fuck are we looking for there ? Morals ? Lessons ? One last glimpse of the jungle ? Decades pass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and again with our devils . The question is : When to cease ? Photograph : Illustration by Sterling Hundley I 'd say now . Right after we 've all finished Tree of Smoke ( Farrar , Straus and Giroux , $27 ) , by Denis Johnson , the last book I will ever read on the ' ' 60s . In part , that 's because it 's a big book , a story that works in the best ways a big book can  --  a multipronged tale , told in a straight-ahead chapter-by-chapter chronology , clear and light-bearing as a great tale , something like Lonesome Dove for the Tet Offensive set . To say that readers have been waiting for a large crossover book like this from Denis Johnson for 20 years now would only echo the beef that some people have with his darkly lyric Jesus ' Son or the shattering Angels , his best and first novel  --  that Johnson 's work is somehow too bleak and narrow for a broader readership . And so Tree of Smoke is being heralded , at long last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shank of the book follows Skip Sands , an operative in psychological operations against the Viet Cong , a weirdly exterior character who drifts from one mission to the next , haunted by the shadow of his uncle Francis Sands , a CIA legend whom they call simply the Colonel . Moving in and out of the years are two hard-luck brothers , Bill and James Houston , who knock around Pacific postings before drifting homeward , toward the presumably insoluble pull of the vacant and scary desert of Arizona . One pair makes you larger , and one pair makes you small . You know this sort of book . The requisite multiple characters  --  mishmashed across several continents  --  living lives that at times feel disconnected while remaining steadfastly knotted in their fates and the misjudgments of their culture . It 's a big , chunky shag carpet of a novel , stretching wall-to-wall between 1963 and 1970 . There 's nothing particularly tricky in the structure , nothing wildly experimental in the tone or language . The sweep is purposefully grand , and Johnson knows how to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another , without noisome conjuring . But the truth is , I wo n't read another book about the ' ' 60s because Tree of Smoke is old material , told in a fashion that is weirdly laconic and profoundly gung ho at the same time . Sometimes the dialogue throbs like a Sgt. Rock comic book , and then , pages later , a mere fistfight is described in a slippery , psychedelic light that is Johnson 's own . I never know where to grab on , whom to care about . Maybe that 's what the decade was like , too . I do n't know . So many books . So many movies . I ca n't tell the difference between what I remember and what I 've been told . Worse , I ca n't care anymore . And Tree of Smoke just does n't make me . The trouble is that , critics and publishing execs aside , no one was ever waiting for a knee-buckling crossover from Denis Johnson . He 'd already dazzled and made us hurt . Done and done again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOHN ED BRADLEY has written a love poem to football , to his coach ( Charlie Mac ) , to his daddy , to the LSU Tigers , to his teammates , to the idea of being a member of a team , to grabbing your coach with one of those teammates and carrying him aloft from the field , to going to seed in the years after . His new book , It Never Rains in Tiger Stadium ( ESPN Books , $25 ) , makes you love all of these things , too , and wonder what the hell you were doing when you could have been playing college football . You were a pencil neck , so college ball was n't an option , but the point is that like all absorbing writing , Bradley 's book is about much more than it seems to be when you crack it open . Tiger Stadium makes you want to charge back onto a field you never played on , connect to teammates you never knew . Find some kind of collective purpose , somehow , some way . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time .  --  MARK WARREN IN FAILED-CONSULTANT NEWS . . . GERHARD HOOKERDICKER was one of Boston 's most reviled high-tech consultants , a bullshit artist whose crowning achievement was driving Prognosticon , the celebrated start-up company that used information systems to predict the future , straight into the ground . So what now ? A book , of course . Forbidden Common Knowledge ( Hurtling Spear Press , $25 ; hurtlingspear.com ) is his collection of terrifying facts that we all know are true but do n't really do anything about . Things like " Our leaders are idiots , " " The war is insane , " " Marriage sucks . " A bit depressing ? Yes . But funny . Very funny . We 're All Fuk 'd SO WE MAY AS WELL TAKE A CUE FROM JUNOT DIAZ : EMBRACE THE CRAZINESS , ORDER A FEW DRINKS , AND ENJOY THE RIDE JUNOT DIAZ is n't messing around . Yunior  --  the narrator of The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao ( Riverhead , $25 )  --  he is messing around . With women , with drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Through Yunior we learn of Oscar Wao 's exquisitely damned immigrant family . We also learn of the so-called fuk curse they ca n't escape . It 's a curse of your people , of love , of New Jersey . The curse that brought down longtime Dominican dictator Trujillo and JFK alike . And the curse that brings down Oscar  --  a nerdy fatboy , disparaged and done for by age seven , the one Dominican teenager in all New Jersey who ca n't lose his virginity . Like his shattering 1996 debut collection , Drown , Daz 's first novel is dense and thick , teeming with observations stacked tight like staples . From Santo Domingo to Paterson , New Jersey , from cane fields to college , Daz mashes up history and modernity as we follow the doomed fate of Oscar 's family . Magical realism and animal guides find a home alongside sex , salsa , and sadism . Daz examines the ruinous damage wrought by Trujillo with the same fervor as he dissects Oscar 's obsession with Tolkien and Akira . There are no real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both . For Daz , this is not simply a fashion but a philosophy . His writing is unruly , manic , seductive . He urges the reader to grab it all , exclude nothing , face facts , get laid , get drunk , smile on your brother , marry , and live your life in all its inescapable lunacy . Most important , do n't fool yourself into believing that it could have unfolded any differently . Because like Oscar , no one escapes the past . Every character  --  every person  --  is damned from the start . And that , above all else  --  more than the intricate language , the ambitious story arc , the weaving of timelines and plot  --  is Daz 's peak accomplishment . Unfailing empathy . He judges no one . Not the whores or the fascists or the abusers . In Daz 's landscape , we are all the same , victims of a history and a present that do n't just bleed together but stew . Often in hilarity . Mostly in heartbreak . In the end , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . John Coltrane , the Book SAXOPHONE NERD , heroin junkie , psychedelic warrior , holy man , mild-mannered suburban dad  --  John Coltrane did n't just reinvent what we think of as jazz , he constantly reinvented himself in the process . And so in Coltrane : The Story of a Sound ( Farrar , Straus and Giroux , $23 ) , by Ben Ratliff , we see Coltrane bursting with talent but crippled by drugs . We see Coltrane kicking the habit , then calmly unleashing a series of revolutions that threatened to both save jazz and entirely destroy it . It 's a portrait of a bewildering genius and an elegy for an art form ; after Coltrane 's death in 1967 , jazz slipped into a long illness from which it has yet to recover . The jazz critic for The New York Times , Ratliff is engaging and opinionated throughout , picking up the loose strands of Coltrane 's myth and weaving them back into the sturdy line of his music . But better yet , at 272 pages , he 's a great editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too long , too wanky , too dense  --  Ratliff learned an important lesson from his subject : Sometimes a few well-chosen notes are more powerful than a barrage of impenetrable sound .  --  BEN HUGHES For an interview with Ben Ratliff , go to esquire.com/coltrane. &gt;&gt; EIGHTEEN-WORD REVIEW &gt;IF YOU LIKED SCHOOL , YOU 'LL LOVE WORK by Irvine Welsh Stories that read like gross bar talk .
