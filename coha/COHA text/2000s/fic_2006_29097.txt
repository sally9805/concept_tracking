Small Steps By Louis Sachar Random House Louis Sachar A rusted Honda Civic drove noisily down the street and parked across from the mayor 's house . Armpit had finished digging his trench and was attaching PVC pipe . The mayor had gone back inside . The driver-side door had been bashed in , and it would have cost more to fix than the car was worth . The driver had to work his way over the stick shift and then exit on the passenger side . The personalized license plate read : X RAY . " Armpit ! " X-Ray shouted as he crossed the street . " Armpit ! " The guys at work did n't know him by that name , but if he did n't say something X-Ray would just keep on shouting . Better to answer and shut him up . " Hey , " he called back . " Man , you 're really sweating , " X-Ray said as he came near . " Yeah , well , you 'd sweat too if you were digging . " " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said X-Ray . They had met each other at Camp Green Lake . " Look , do n't call me Armpit around other people , all right ? " Armpit said . " But that 's your name , dawg . You should never be ashamed of who you are . " X-Ray had the kind of smile that kept you from hating him no matter how annoying he was . He was skinny and wore glasses , which were now covered with clip-on shades . He picked up Armpit 's shovel . " Different shape . " " Yeah , it 's for digging trenches , not holes . " X-Ray studied it awhile . " Seems like it would be harder to dig with . No leverage . " He let it drop . " So you must be making a ton of money . " Armpit shrugged . " I 'm doing all right . " " A ton of money , " X-Ray repeated . Armpit felt uncomfortable talking about money with X-Ray . " So really , how much you got saved up so far ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He knew exactly how much he had . Eight hundred and fifty-seven dollars . He hoped to break a thousand with his next paycheck . " Got to be at least a thousand , " said X-Ray . " You 've been working for three months . " " Just part-time . " Besides working , Armpit was also taking two classes in summer school . He had to make up for all the schooling he 'd missed while at Green Lake . " And they take out for taxes and stuff , so really I do n't take home all that much . " " Eight hundred ? " " I do n't know , maybe . " " The reason I 'm asking , " X-Ray said , " the reason I 'm asking is I got a business proposition for you . How would you like to double your money in less than two weeks ? " Armpit smiled as he shook his head . " I do n't think so . " " I just need six hundred dollars . Double your money , guaranteed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Look , things are going all right for me right now , and I just want to keep it all cool . " " Do n't you even want to hear me out ? " " Not really . " " It 's not against the law , " X-Ray assured him . " I checked . " " Yeah , you did n't think selling little bags of parsley for fifty dollars an ounce was against the law either . " " Hey , it 's not my fault what people think they 're buying . How is that my fault ? Am I supposed to be a mind reader ? " X-Ray had been sent to Camp Green Lake for selling bags of dried parsley and oregano to customers who thought they were buying marijuana . That was also why his family had to move from Lubbock to Austin shortly after he was released . " Look , I just do n't want to do anything that might screw things up , " Armpit said . " That 's what you think ? That I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering you an opportunity . An opportunity . If the Wright brothers came to you , you would have told them it 's impossible to fly . " " The Wright brothers ? " asked Armpit . " What century are you living in ? " " I just do n't get it , " said X-Ray . " I do n't get it . I offer my best friend an opportunity to double his money , and he wo n't even listen to my idea . " " All right , tell me your idea . " " Forget it . If you 're not interested I 'll find somebody else . " " Tell me your idea . " He actually was beginning to get just a little bit curious . " What 's the point ? " asked X-Ray . " If you 're not going to even listen . . . " " All right , I 'm listening , " said Armpit . X-Ray smiled . " Just two words . " He paused for effect . " Kaira DeLeon . " It was eleven-thirty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where Kaira DeLeon , a seventeen-year-old African American girl , was just waking up . Her face pressed against Pillow , which was , in fact , a pillow . There was n't much oomph left in the stuffing , and the edges were frayed . The picture of the bear with a balloon , which had once been brightly colored , had faded so much it was hardly visible . Kaira groggily climbed out of bed . She wore boxer shorts and was unbuttoning her pajama top as she made her way to what she thought was the bathroom . She opened the door , then shrieked . A thirty-year-old white guy , sitting on a couch , stared back at her . She clutched the two halves of her pajama top together and slammed the door . The door bounced back open . " Doofus ! " Kaira shouted at the man , then closed the door again , making sure it latched this time . " Ca n't a person have some privacy around here ! " she screamed , then made her way to the bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over the last three and a half weeks she 'd been in nineteen different hotel suites , each with no fewer than three rooms , and one with six . So really , it was no wonder she went through the wrong door . She did n't even remember what city she was in . She suspected that Polly , her psychiatrist , would tell her she had done that on purpose ; something about wanting to show her body to her bodyguard . Maybe she was better off not telling Polly about it . Everything she said in her therapy sessions was supposed to be confidential , but Kaira suspected that Polly , like a parrot , repeated everything to El Genius . She had no privacy-not in her hotel room , not even in her own thoughts . The problem was that , except for Polly , there was n't anybody on the tour she could talk to . Certainly not her mother . And not her doofus bodyguard . The guys in her band were all at least forty years old , and treated her like she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their late twenties , but they seemed to resent her being the center of attention . The only time she felt at peace was when she was singing . Then it was just her and the song and everybody else just disappeared . Her concert tour would take her to a total of fifty-four cities , so she was n't even half done yet . She was now on the southern swing . From Atlanta they 'd be going to Jacksonville , then Miami , Birmingham , Memphis , Nashville , Little Rock , and Baton Rouge , and on to Texas : Houston , Austin , and Dallas . Originally the tour was supposed to include San Antonio instead of Austin , but that was changed at the last minute due to a monster truck rally at the Alamodome-not that Kaira cared , or even knew about the change . Other people took care of things like that . Other people took care of everything . Kaira had accidentally left Pillow behind in New Haven , and Aileen , the tour 's travel coordinator , took a flight back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found it . Kaira emerged from the bathroom thirty minutes later wearing a hotel robe . She called room service and ordered a glass of orange juice , pancakes , a cappuccino , and French fries . It would have to last her until the concert . If she tried to eat before the concert she 'd puke . After a concert she usually had a bowl of ice cream . She got dressed , then stepped back out to the sitting area . Fred , her doofus bodyguard , was still there , going through her mail . " As soon as I turn eighteen , you 're going to be the second person I fire . " Fred did n't even look up . It was n't the first time he 'd heard it . The television was on CNN . Kaira changed the station to the Cartoon Network . The first person she 'd fire would be El Genius . He was her business manager and agent , and also happened to be married to her mother . They had gotten married shortly before the tour . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to call him El Genius . No matter how hard Kaira tried to sound sarcastic when she used that name , he always took it as a compliment . Her father had been killed in Iraq . His name was John Spears . Kaira 's real name was Kathy Spears , but there was already a famous singer with that last name . El Genius had come up with the name Kaira DeLeon . " You mean like Ponce de Leon ? " Kaira had asked him . " Who ? " Some genius . Kaira explained to the genius who Ponce de Leon was , which was why her first CD was titled The Fountain of Youth El Genius thought it looked classy for DeLeon to be spelled as one word , with a capital letter in the middle . Kaira had learned all about Ponce de Leon when she was in fourth grade and living at the Pensacola Naval Air Station . She had to learn the history of Florida . By year 's end she was living at Fort Myer , where they 'd been studying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entire school year in the same place . " So , anything from Billy Boy ? " she asked Fred . Fred shook his head . " Aw , too bad , " Kaira said . " He writes such charming letters . " " It 's not funny , " said Fred . " I think it 's hilarious , " said Kaira . She sang , " Oh , where have you been , Billy Boy , Billy Boy ? Oh , where have you been , charming Billy ? " Billy Boy had sent her four letters so far . He told her he thought she was lovely , she sang like a bird , and someday he would kill her . El Genius hired Fred after the first letter . Kaira would n't have been surprised if El Genius had actually written the letters , to scare her into staying confined to her hotel room . He was such a control freak . She was sure Fred told him everything she did . " You got another marriage proposal , " Fred said . " White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he letter . Fred looked at it . " White , " he said . " What is it with you guys ? " asked Kaira . It was her seventh proposal , and every one had been from a white man . Fred carefully put the letter and the photograph in a plastic bag . " What are you doing that for ? " " FBI . " " He said he wanted to marry me , not kill me , " Kaira pointed out . " For some people , it 's the same thing , " said Fred . Kaira glanced at him , surprised . The Doofus had actually said something kind of profound . " Let me see what he looks like ? " Fred handed her the plastic bag . Kaira laughed when she saw the picture . " He looks like you ! " The photograph was that of a very muscular man wearing no shirt . The only difference between him and Fred was that his hair was long and wavy , while Fred had a buzz cut . " You ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she handed the plastic bag back to him .
