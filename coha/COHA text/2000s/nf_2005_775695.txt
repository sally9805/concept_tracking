Cavendish // For many years Cambridge railway station was not to be found in Cambridge at all , but in the countryside a mile or so out of town . The maps show the line from London closing in on the city and then at the last moment veering eastwards as if repelled by invisible forces within . And repulsion by invisible forces was more or less what happened , for when the first railway was approaching in the 1840s the Cambridge colleges were so fearful of its influence that - in much the same spirit that they secured a ban on Sunday rail traffic - they contrived to locate the station at what one historian has called ' an inconvenient distance ' . Several times in later years there were proposals for a more central terminus but they all came to nothing and eventually it was the town that moved , houses and businesses steadily creeping out along the road towards the station until the two were joined and the green fields pushed into the background . That inconvenient distance from the old town centre remains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dismayed to find their true destination some way off . // At 8.50 p.m. on Monday 17 October 1927 , Ernest Thomas Sinton Walton was just such an arrival . He was twenty-four years old , of medium height with a wiry build , a high forehead , heavy spectacles and a suit of clothes which , while perfectly respectable , bore no trace of style . He was tired , having taken the overnight ferry from Ireland and then changed trains twice as he worked his way across England . The carriages had been crowded and at each staging-post he had had to oversee the unloading and loading of a heavy trunk containing such items as his toolbox , his essential textbooks and , most precious of all , the draft of his M.Sc. thesis . Now he alighted amid the gloom and steam of Cambridge station and once again extracted his trunk from the baggage car . Depositing it in the left-luggage once , he made his way out through the arched portico and there discovered the quirk of his location : he had not quite arrived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to make contact with anyone in the town so he found a hotel nearby and had an early night . // After breakfast the next morning he set about his business . It was fortunate that he had an equable personality for another man in his position might have been anxious . There had been an unfortunate mix-up over his application to become a research student at the Cavendish Laboratory , with the result that while other successful applicants had arrived weeks earlier he had needed a last-minute scramble to secure his place . In fact there were grounds to suspect that the laboratory had accepted him only with reluctance , so a warm welcome was by no means assured . This was bad enough , but when Walton made it into town that morning a more pressing concern soon presented itself : time was ticking by but nowhere in the medieval maze of streets and passages could he find his destination and no passer-by whom he approached was able to guide him . ' Cambridge , ' he wrote a couple of days later , ' is the hardest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must have spent over half an hour looking for the Cavendish Laboratory , and I scarcely know the way to it yet , there are so many turns and streets to go through . ' // Free School Lane is little more than an alleyway at the back of one of the older colleges , but half-way along it a relieved Walton at last came across the tall , grey Victorian building he was looking for . There was nothing to announce its identity unless you counted a statue of the Duke of Devonshire ( family name : Cavendish ) and an inscription in Latin which , when translated , announced : ' The works of the Lord are great , searched out by all who have delight in them . ' Walton made nothing of these clues but he had been assured this was the place and the oak doors were wide open , so in he went . An archway led beneath the body of the building towards a cobbled courtyard crowded with parked bicycles , and on the right was an office . Asking to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and that he should report instead to the assistant director . Stone stairs took him up to a dingy corridor where he soon found the office of Dr James Chadwick , a lean man of thirty-five with spectacles , an intense gaze and not much conversation . That Walton had failed to turn up at 9 a.m. sharp was of no consequence to the assistant director since the laboratory tended to begin the day in leisurely fashion . ( Punctuality mattered much more when it came to going home . ) In any case Chadwick had other things on his mind . Briskly but politely he did what he usually did with new researchers from overseas and sent the young man off to register as a member of the university and be assigned somewhere to live . // The University of Cambridge has many colleges , most of them of ancient foundation , and it was to Trinity that Walton made his way . This was the largest and the richest of them all , but it was also the college most closely associated with the Cavendish . Walton was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on to the junior bursar , who after a short interview dispatched him to number 4 Park Parade , a few streets away at the north end of town , to view some lodgings that had just been vacated . Walton liked these . ' They are very clean , ' he wrote to his father , ' and the sitting room , which I have to myself ; is very comfortable . It is completely furnished and has two easy chairs and a small Chesterfield . ' The bedroom , upstairs in a sort of attic , was less commodious and the bed was hard , but the rent , at ? 11 per term , was considerably cheaper than rooms in college , and within his budget . Breakfasts and the use of his gas fire , he noted , were not included in the price and the electric light was also an extra , at ? 1 per term . The rest of his day was filled with collecting his trunk from the station and opening an account at the Westminster Bank , and in the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a five-course affair beginning at what he considered the late hour of 8 p.m . It impressed him greatly and he could not help drawing the comparison with his alma mater , Trinity College , Dublin . ' There is a huge dining hall and the place is swarming with waiters , in fact the style leaves T.C.D. far behind . You can order almost anything you like either in the hall or to be sent round to your rooms ... but of course it all appears on the bill . ' // The following morning he found his way once again to the laboratory and met Rutherford himself . He did not record his first impressions of the great man except to say that he seemed ' very nice ' , but an Australian student who arrived that same autumn , Mark Oliphant , has left a vivid picture of a young researcher 's first encounter with the Cavendish professor . // When my turn came , I entered a small office littered with books and papers , the desk cluttered in a manner which I had been taught at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raining , and drops of water ran reluctantly down the grime-covered glass of the uncurtained window . I was received genially by a large , rather florid man , with thinning fair hair and a large moustache , who reminded me forcibly of the keeper of the general store and post office in a little village in the hills behind Adelaide where I had spent part of my childhood . Rutherford made me feel welcome and at ease at once . He spluttered a little as he talked , from time to time holding a match to a pipe which produced smoke and ash like a volcano . // Walton had sent ahead of him an account of the M.Sc. research he had done in Dublin and after the opening formalities the professor referred to this . The work was not in atomic physics but hydrodynamics and Rutherford said he had showed it to a colleague in that field who liked it a great deal . In particular he had praised the photographs Walton had been able to take of a curious effect in water , believing they were the clearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of impression to make , for to Rutherford nothing was so important as to be able to carry off an experiment well . There seems to have been no hesitancy in the professor 's welcome either , despite the problems over the application , and so when Walton bade Rutherford farewell and stepped out of that scruffy , smoke-filled office he was able to go straight upstairs and take his place in the laboratory 's induction course . In this quiet way he joined what was a remarkable community . // There was nowhere in the world quite like the Cavendish . Founded in 1874 with funds from the Devonshire family , it was already , in 1927 , a place of illustrious tradition . All Four of its directors had been of international stature , physicists who remain to this day , if not quite household names , at least prominent in the histories and textbooks . Rutherford 's immediate predecessor , Joseph John Thomson , or ' J. J. ' as he was known , had discovered the electron . Thomson had succeeded Lord Rayleigh , an experimenter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound and was the discoverer of the noble gas , argon . And Rayleigh 's predecessor , the first director , was James Clerk Maxwell , the great Scottish theorist of electromagnetism and a heroic figure in nineteenth-century science . The thrill of a heritage so rich , accumulated in barely half a century , must have impressed itself upon every young researcher entering the workrooms and lecture theatres of the laboratory , but the reputation of the Cavendish did not depend on history alone . Including Rutherford himself , in 1927 there were three Nobel prizewinners on the staff and a fourth researcher was to receive the prize that winter , while among the younger scientists a further four or five ( including Chadwick ) were already acknowledged as world leaders in their fields . Such concentration of talent was exceptional in a world where the age of gentlemen researchers working alone in private laboratories was fresh in many memories , but under Rutherford 's leadership the laboratory in Free School Lane had grown accustomed to taking its own path . // There was the matter of numbers : by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory for postgraduate physicists . Each year it admitted fifteen or more , roughly half of whom had taken their primary degrees at Cambridge . Of the rest a few came from other British universities but most were from overseas , principally Canada , Australia and New Zealand but also the United States , India , Japan , Italy , Russia and other European countries . At any given time , then , there were around forty people carrying out postgraduate research and in the context of the British university scene in the 1920s this was mass production . What the Cavendish expected of them was that they would do original work , suitably supervised and if possible published , and then leave with a Ph.D . if they were good enough . Some would need three years for this but others who had already done research at their previous university might be out in two . The objective in educational terms was straightforward , as Chadwick was to explain : ' We hoped that they would get the proper attitude to research and acquire the ability to tackle any problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other universities , to industry or government service or into schoolteaching , while one or two in each year who showed particular promise would stay on as researcher-lecturers if space and funds could be found . Besides this general goal of raising the national competence in science and spreading the word , the laboratory and its director had an additional objective , and this was another distinguishing mark of the Cavendish . // Rutherford once observed that all true science was physics and the rest was stamp collecting . Within the walls of his own laboratory he took this approach one step further , relegating all physics that did not concern itself with the atom to the philatelic category . Rutherford and Chadwick deliberately directed the work of the Cavendish towards the study of the interior of the atom , and so far as was practical towards the nucleus . Barring a few senior figures pursuing their own inquiries and a handful of cases among the students , all the researchers were therefore rowing in the same direction , to the same beat , and the result was a domination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Between the discovery of radioactivity in 1896 and the end of the First World War most of the experimental work on the atom had been done in three countries : Britain ( with its dominions ) , Germany and France , with Britain making the largest contribution . The war and its aftermath severely disrupted Germany 's efforts , and though research in the United States was slowly growing in scale and ambition there is no doubt that as the 1920s advanced British dominance increased markedly - and in Britain it was Cambridge that was making the running . Atomic physics was widely viewed as the most exciting field in all science and if you were a young researcher hoping to make a contribution , then no matter where in the world you came from your best course was to get yourself to the Cavendish . // So it had been with Ernest Walton . He was the son of a Methodist minister who , following the policy of the Church , moved frequently between parishes in Ireland . It had been natural , therefore , to send the boy off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he proved a star pupil , with a special talent and enthusiasm for science and mathematics and also a gift for making things . One family story has him reading geometry textbooks at home for pleasure , while on his birthdays he liked to be given tools to equip what grew into a sophisticated home workshop . A surviving school report describes him as ' swift , sure , penetrating and comprehensive as thinker and worker ' , and declares that he showed ' brilliant promise ' . Sure enough , when he found his way to university in Dublin he carried all before him in mathematics and physics and on graduating in 1926 ( with first-class degrees in both subjects ) he stayed on as a postgraduate , choosing physics for the practical reason that it allowed him to use his hands as well as his brain . His research supervisor set him the task of studying the flow of liquids past cylinders , a matter of importance in civil engineering and aeronautics . The effect of this flow was known - it created twin groups of vortices in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's job was to measure and explain it . Using an elegant apparatus of his own creation he photographed the vortices at each stage in their progress and then described the rules governing their formation and behaviour . This project was still under way when he learned of a much grander career possibility : a scholarship that might enable him to work under Rutherford . //
