Man of Blood // Razor wire is made up of thin metal twine with small sharp barbs every few inches that is twirled into coils about two feet in diameter , then bundled outside fences , roofs , and doorways like a lethal scarf . Razor wire is so ubiquitous in Israel it could almost be the national flower . It even looks like a shrub , the way it twists and turns , catches plastic bags and soda bottles in its web , and rubs against civilization like poison ivy on a playground . Whenever I see a bundle , I imagine myself making a daring escape through its coils . Then I see myself slipping , my leg catching in the tangle , tearing , then blood , and the disappointment of failure . Razor wire is barbed wire with a greater power to intimidate . // It does have one unexpected benefit , though . The airiness of its coils allows just enough light to get through so that if you leave it for a while , at , say , the checkpoint between Jerusalem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root in the desert and pop up through the fear . // Razor fences are not the only impediment to traveling the six miles from Jerusalem to Bethlehem . There is also , on this chilly morning , the Israeli Army , the Palestinian security forces , and a border so volatile that Avner could n't traverse it . He left me at a long line of cars to walk along a cliff with a few Italian tourists in wheelchairs , through a checkpoint armed with Israeli teenagers , into a gamut of taxi drivers so desperate for business one actually looked hurt when I passed him by . " Why are you angry ? " he shouted . // Moments later Arlet Odeh sped up in a white Mercedes . She was thirty years old , with dangling curls , a hawk nose , and deep bags under her eyes that came more from lack of hope than from lack of sleep . Arlet was also a tour guide with no tours to guide . For three years she had n't worked . Her father is old , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred Palestinian Christian families left in town . " We are living in a cage , " she said . " But living means having a life . I have no life . Would you like to see where Jesus was born ? " // " Actually , on this trip , I 'm interested in King David . " // She brightened . " He was born here , too ! " // We headed toward the center of town . The cobblestone streets , repaved when Pope John Paul II visited for the bimillennium of Jesus ' birth , were deserted , shops boarded up , few people in sight . Though Christmas was still months away , a pale plastic wreath and faded star dangled from the side of the road . // Bethlehem is one of the few cities that appears across the entire two-thousand-year arc of the Hebrew Bible , from the patriarchs to the prophets . The city is first mentioned in Genesis as the place where Jacob 's wife Rachel died after giving birth to Benjamin . A tomb marks the spot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , empty . Joshua later assigns the area to the tribe of Judah , and it 's frequently mentioned during the period of the kings , most prominently as the birthplace of King David . The story of the boy warrior who becomes the king of Israel lords over the early books of the Prophets and introduces what will become a major theme of the second half of the Hebrew Bible : the Israelites ' quest to find proper balance between their spiritual identity as an ethically minded people of God and their political identity as a nation strong enough to survive in a region of superpowers . // After the lightning conquest described in the Book of Joshua , the biblical story quickly becomes diffuse , even chaotic . The Book of Judges describes an awkward transition as the people settle the land and try to determine their political leadership . The preeminent fact of the Israelites ' existence is that , unlike their neighbors , they do n't have a monarch . Four times the text says , " In those days there was no king in Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in his own eyes . " For two hundred years , their leaders are judges , including Ehud , Gideon , and Samson , from the Hebrew word sopet , which adds the theological element of divination to the more legalistic English term . The authority of the judges comes from God , the ultimate sopet , and their principal task is to ensure that the people uphold the Laws of Moses . // But the people are not satisfied , especially as they are repeatedly trounced by the Philistines , the new power along the coastal plain . Samuel , the reigning judge at the time , gathers the Israelites and leads a comeback . But the people still feel insecure and , around 1020 B.C.E. , parade en masse to an aging Samuel : " Appoint a king for us , to govern us like all other nations . " In a classic case of " Throw the bums out ! " they declare they are not happy being ruled exclusively by God ; they want more competent , secular leadership based on sound economics and a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the crabby wandering people of the desert become the surly settled people of the land . The Israelites are never happy . In the Sinai they gripe about the lack of food and poor leadership and demand to be sent back into slavery ; in the Promised Land they gripe about their lack of power and poor leadership and demand to be subjected to a king . In both cases , Israel lives up to its namesake , Ysra'el , one who wrestles with God . // And God , as he has done before , lashes out : " Me they have rejected as their king . " Still , he grants the request but asks Samuel to warn them of their mistake . Samuel 's speech is one of the most prophetic in the Bible . A king , he says , will take your sons and sacrifice them in battle , take your daughters and make them perfumers , cooks , and bakers . He will seize your choice . . . //               @ @ @ @ @ @
