What 's wrong ? // You first parents of the human race . . . who ruined yourself for an apple , what might you have done for a truffled turkey ? //  --  Brillat-Savarin 1 // Hundreds of self-help books and call-in radio stations , together with the advice of such American ethic gurus as William Bennett and Randy Cohen , provide us with principled reasons and methods for leading a virtuous life . Law schools across the globe graduate thousands of scholars each year , trained to reason through cases of fraud , theft , violence , and injustice ; the law books are filled with principles for how to judge human behavior , both moral and amoral . Most major universities include a mandatory course in moral reasoning , designed to teach students about the importance of dispassionate logic , moving from evidence to conclusion , checking assumptions and explicitly stating inferences and hypotheses . Medical and legal boards provide rational and highly reasoned policies in order to set guidelines for morally permissible , forbidden , and punishable actions . Businesses set up contracts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders train soldiers to act with a cool head , thinking through alternative strategies , planning effective attacks , and squelching the emotions and instincts that may cause impulsive behavior when reasoning is required to do the right thing . Presidential committees are established to clarify ethical principles and the consequences of violations , both at home and abroad . All of these professionals share a common perspective : conscious moral reasoning from explicit principles is the cause of our moral judgments . As a classic text in moral philosophy concludes , " Morality is , first and foremost , a matter of consulting reason . The morally right thing to do , in any circumstance , is whatever there are the best reasons for doing . " 2 // This dominant perspective falls prey to an illusion : Just because we can consciously reason from explicit principles  --  handed down from parents , teachers , lawyers , or religious leaders  --  to judgments of right and wrong does n't mean that these principles are the source of our moral decisions . On the contrary , I argue that moral judgments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grammar that evaluates the causes and consequences of our own and others ' actions . This account shifts the burden of evidence from a philosophy of morality to a science of morality . // This book describes how our moral intuitions work and why they evolved . It also explains how we can anticipate what lies ahead for our species . I show that by looking at our moral psychology as an instinct  --  an evolved capacity of all human minds that unconsciously and automatically generates judgments of right and wrong  --  that we can better understand why some of our behaviors and decisions will always be construed as unfair , permissible , or punishable , and why some situations will tempt us to sin in the face of sensibility handed down from law , religion , and education . Our evolved moral instincts do not make moral judgments inevitable . Rather , they color our perceptions , constrain our moral options , and leave us dumbfounded because the guiding principles are inaccessible , tucked away in the mind 's library of unconscious knowledge . // Although I largely focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how and why they come to such decisions , it is important to understand the relationship between description and prescription  --  between what is and what ought to be . // In 1903 , the philosopher George Edward Moore noted that the dominant philosophical perspective of the time  --  John Stuart Mill 's utilitarianism  --  frequently fell into the naturalistic fallacy : attempting to justify a particular moral principle by appealing to what is good . 3 For Mill , utilitarianism was a reform policy , one designed to change how people ought to behave by having them focus on the overall good , defined in terms of natural properties of human nature such as our overall happiness . For Moore , the equation of good with natural was fallacious . There are natural things that are bad ( polio , blindness ) and unnatural things that are good ( vaccines , reading glasses ) . We are not licensed to move from the natural to the good . // A more general extension of the naturalistic fallacy comes from deriving ought from is . Consider these facts : In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than men ( a sex difference that is consistent with our primate ancestors ) , men are more violent than women ( also consistent with our primate past ) , and polygamy is more common than monogamy ( consistent with the rest of the animal kingdom ) . From these facts , we are not licensed to conclude that women should do all of the parenting while men drink beers , society should sympathize with male violence because testosterone makes violence inevitable , and women should expect and support male promiscuity because it 's in their genes , part of nature 's plan . The descriptive principles we uncover about human nature do not necessarily have a causal relationship to the prescriptive principles . Drawing a causal connection is fallacious. // Moore 's characterization of the naturalistic fallacy caused generations of philosophers to either ignore or ridicule discoveries in the biological sciences . Together with the work of the analytic philosopher Gottlieb Frege , it led to the pummeling of ethical naturalism , a perspective in philosophy that attempted to make sense of the good by an appeal to the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking seriously about moral principles and those attempting to uncover the signatures of human nature . Discussions of moral ideals were therefore severed from the facts of moral behavior and psychology . // The surgical separation of facts from ideals is , however , too extreme . Consider the following example : 4 // Fact : The only difference between a doctor giving a child anesthesia and not giving her anesthesia is that without it , the child will be in agony during surgery . The anesthesia will have no ill effects on this child , but will cause her to temporarily lose consciousness and sensitivity to pain . She will then awaken from the surgery with no ill consequences , and in better health thanks to the doctor 's work . // Evaluative judgment : Therefore , the doctor should give the child anesthesia. //
