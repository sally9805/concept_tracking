Those colorful plastic bracelets popularized by Madonna and Avril Lavigne have taken on a risque new twist . The bangles convey a not-so-secret sexual code depending on their color , indicating different levels of intimacy starting from hugs . In a game some kids call Snap , they yank the rubbery bracelets from the wrists of fellow students to indicate which kind of sex they would like to have . Grabbing a red bracelet is asking for a lap dance , for example , and a blue one can mean oral sex . The code has even spread internationally . <P> In the U.S. the items are frequently referred to as " jelly bracelets " ; overseas , they 're " shag bracelets "  --  a term familiar to anyone who has seen an Austin Powers movie . <P> While most kids seem to take the code as merely an inside joke , some schools like Fort McCoy in Marion County , Fla. , have banned the bracelets . " It 's a hot-button topic here , " says school-board member Sue Mosley , who has heard complaints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bracelets as just kitschy accessories . " I 've been wearing my bracelet since eighth grade , " says 15-year-old Roby Behrens of Los Angeles . " It 's a fashion thing . You do n't need them to have sex , but people do use them to kiss or get to third base . " <P>  --  By Jeffrey Ressner
