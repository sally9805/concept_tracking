THE HUNDRED YEARS ' WAR OVER ANXIETY // Anxiety , a famous psychoanalyst once observed , is one of the few things that never deceives . It is also one of those rare elements of psychology that seem constant as it ripples through the ages , tormenting its sufferers with persistent , sometimes grinding dread . Those familiar with the sensation know it feels dreadfully tangible even when the fear in question is often imaginary . But has anxiety always been tied to shyness , or is the connection more recent ? // In listing the first recorded use of the word anxiety , the Oxford English Dictionary names an emotion we 're likely to recognize instantly , though its spelling and context will seem slightly foreign : " There dyed he , " Sir Thomas More writes in 1525 about Jesus of Nazareth , " without grudge , without anxietie . " More used the word to suggest worry or concern rather than illness , but toward the end of the nineteenth century medical lexicons began calling it a morbid " condition of agitation and depression whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases . " And somehow it feels right that the word 's meaning and history expanded to include extreme states . It might even be odd to have a stress-free definition of anxiety . // The word shyness also boasts a long history , and in earlier periods had meanings that modern commentators are apt to overlook . When people in the Middle Ages used the adjective shy , they meant horses and other animals that were skittish or easily frightened . Only in the seventeenth century did the word cross over to include humans-sometimes , entire peoples-who are reticent , suspicious , even untrustworthy . All of these meanings are broadly comparable , yet no two are identical . One might even ponder how the shy slipped into appearing untrustworthy , as if being cautious were so provocative that it entitled strangers to question one 's integrity . // In his Anatomy of Melancholy , also dating from the seventeenth century , Richard Burton described what can happen when shyness combines or collides with anxiety . He portrays a man Hippocrates found notable , because " through bashfulness , suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; loves darkness as life , and can not endure the light , ' or to sit in lightsome places ; his hat still in his eyes , he will neither see nor be seen by his goodwill . He dare not come in company , for fear he should be misused , disgraced , overshoot himself in gesture or speeches , or be sick ; he thinks every man observes him , aims at him , derides him , owes him malice . " // Scholars today like mentioning this passage because it strikes them as a perfect example of early social phobia . But is that an accurate comparison or one telling us more about contemporary assumptions ? There is , for starters , the small problem of anachronism . The Greeks had no name for social phobia ; given their linguistic and philosophical gifts , they doubtless would have coined one ( like xenophobia , or TEXT NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII , a deep fear of foreigners ) if they had considered social phobia a problem , much less an illness . // True , the Greeks recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart-pounding dread that often " amazeth many men that are to speak , or show themselves in public assemblies , or before some great personages , as Tully confessed of himself , that he trembled still at the beginning of his speech ; and Demosthenes , that great orator of Greece , before Phillipus . " But they credited this fear to known circumstances , not the peculiar symptoms of a mental disorder . They also prized bashfulness , especially in women and younger men , and drew firm distinctions-as our psychiatrists used to do-between chronic anxiety and its more routine counterparts . // " Since ancient times , " Isaac Marks confirms in his classic 1969 study , Fears and Phobias , cultures have recognized that " minor degrees of social anxiety are , of course , perfectly normal and compatible with excellent function . " Despite his key role in grasping why social interactions make some people anxious , Marks now claims that psychiatrists have eroded crucial distinctions between normal and acute anxiety to hype their own research . // Another problem with psychiatrists ' notions about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't attribute the man 's behavior to a single cause , much less to a deeply ingrained psychological one . On the contrary , his allusion to misuse suggests that the man 's avoidance stems from a justified fear of mistreatment , perhaps because of prejudice , ostracism , or a severe misunderstanding with his neighbors . One of the inflections in the Oxford English Dictionary definition of anxiety alludes to groups and individuals who are " timidly or cautiously averse to encountering or having to do with some specified person or thing , " including fear of invasion or retribution . // Hippocrates 's perspective then shifts dramatically by invoking disgrace . Before we rush to call this a malady , we must clarify whether the man 's reaction is due to circumstances or to lasting temperament . And we ca n't really do that , because Hippocrates ( echoed in turn by Burton ) presents an open-ended sketch , not a straightforward case study . Although he considers the man 's behavior notable , he views it more as a foible than as an illness . // How different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the man has a chemical imbalance that needs medical or psychiatric attention . Any hint that his woes may be existential or circumstantial pales before this bedrock explanation : he has low levels of serotonin and needs medication to make him well again . When people are well , after all , we presume they will be sociable. // Still , there are no firm links between health and sociability , and-perhaps more surprising to many-there is no scientific correlation between low serotonin and depression , anxiety , or anger management . Although some psychopharmacologists and drug companies have found it useful to say otherwise , the simplification that low serotonin causes anxiety or depression is , in one critic 's words , little more than " vacuous biobabble . " According to David Healy , author of 12 acclaimed books and more than 120 refereed articles on the topic , the reasons we 're anxious or depressed are far more complex ; they involve intricate ( often unknown ) facets of our psychology , biology , society , and even environment . Nurtured by a litany of drug-company advertisements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about serotonin , because reducing the brain 's formidable complexity to a simple metaphor can look like a foolproof explanation for almost anything . // * * * // Although simple definitions in the Oxford English Dictionary contradict the idea that anxiety and shyness have meant the same thing throughout history , it is useful to add that many lively discussions of shyness and stage fright , including Darwin 's Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals ( 1872 ) , describe these phenomena without any hint of pathology . " Almost every one , " Darwin maintains , " is extremely nervous when first addressing a public assembly , and most men remain so throughout their lives ; but this appears to depend on the consciousness of a great coming exertion especially one which is in some way strange to us , with its associated effects on the nervous system , rather than on shyness . " // The turning point in these discussions came roughly a decade later , when psychiatrists in the 1880s ( known at the time as " alienists " ) began viewing shyness as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms , the battle over how we define or diagnose shyness and similar kinds of anxiety is thus quite recent-it began just over a century ago . But you would n't know that from reading much of the literature on the subject . Psychiatrists are adamant that the problems they have unearthed echo through the ages , a claim the mass media generally take very seriously . // One reason psychiatrists cite historical anecdotes is to give their arguments more clout . Adopting this strategy lets them build scholarly consensus around the urgent treatment of a neglected " disorder . " If a powerhouse physician like Hippocrates allegedly thought the same way about X or Y , then failing to act promptly on fresh evidence of the same problem looks downright irresponsible , no matter how wide the historical chasm . Skeptics will look painfully obtuse , moreover , if they doubt the connection ; the historical comparison will even bring the most intricate debate to a screeching halt . ( " You 'll have to argue with Hippocrates , I 'm afraid ; I 'm just slightly restating his point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the psychiatrist rewrite history : he or she can weave past incidents into recent discoveries and newly revised theories . // " Historical literature is rich in descriptions of persons who probably had intermittent explosive disorder , " claims Susan McElroy at the start of a foundational essay on the illness . The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 3rd Edition ( DSM-III ) first officially recognized this " disorder " in 1980 , almost two decades before McElroy 's essay appeared , but her strategy is shorthand for asking , " What took them so long ? " // The idea here , nicely understated , is that her colleagues have failed to appreciate the magnitude of a problem everyone else knows a great deal about . Just open a classic work of literature or a historical treatise , she implies , and in every century you 'll find someone with symptoms almost identical to those listed in DSM-III or DSM-IV . It does n't matter whether the person was Diogenes , Richard II , Friedrich Nietzsche , or the " angry young men " who rebelled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and novelists Alan Sillitoe and John Braine ) . Nor does it matter if the reasons for that person 's anger were vastly different or were , in the end , quite justified . What matters is pronouncing him mentally ill , for doing so shores up the validity of one 's diagnosis . // To intellectual historians , this approach looks painfully crude , to say the least . Giving facile explanations for past events lets one glide over incongruities and anachronisms , turning major differences between historical periods and cultures into a single narrative that makes sense today . As Helen Saul puts it in Phobias , " Hippocrates saw people with many different phobias over the years , ranging from agoraphobia and social phobia to animal phobias and other fears still common today . " // According to Saul , social phobia recedes more or less unchanged from our world to that of ancient Greece . But why stop there ? In 2001 a team of psychiatrists in California declared that as Samson , the biblical figure , met at least six of DSM-IV ' s seven criteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antisocial personality disorder . " Sadly , the psychiatrists did n't appear to be joking . " Recognition of the diagnosis of ASPD for Samson may help in better understanding the biblical story , " they opined , " and , in general , may help in instances when a leader has ASPD . Also , we hope it stimulates interest in the history of ASPD . " Now it 's true that Samson did n't exactly plan ahead or " conform to social norms . " His " irritability and aggressiveness " also resulted in a " reckless disregard for safety of self or others , " all of these being criteria in the DSM . But the Philistines had gouged out his eyes after Delilah repeatedly betrayed him-factors the scientists either did n't know or conveniently overlooked . // You might think that having one 's eyes gouged out after betrayal by a loved one would be reason enough to express a certain amount of fury . However , if your thinking is fixed in a different groove , all such loosely related examples become illustrations-helpfully recovered-of disorders that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely as variations on our current syndromes. // * * * // The risks of portraying anxiety , fear , or depression as historical constants should be clear . One loses all sense of what is distinctive about the way different eras and cultures represented these traits ; and one drains the emotions in these examples of all complexity , as anyone glancing at , say , Kierkegaard 's metaphysical treatise on The Concept of Anxiety and hereditary sin will appreciate . // Put another way , the era W. H. Auden later dubbed " The Age of Anxiety , " because it encompassed the unsparing atrocities of World War II , the Holocaust , and the use of atomic bombs against the Japanese , does n't align well with the fear that Thucydides said arose in the fifth century B.C. between the Athenians and Spartans , in History of the Peloponnesian War . But it 's comforting to say otherwise . Doing so tells us we are less unusual and isolated than we might think ; and it empowers us to reimagine our individual and collective destinies , based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with almost surgical precision . // In 1994 , at the height of the giddy media coverage of Prozac , Newsweek asked readers if they were " Shy ? Forgetful ? Anxious ? Fearful ? Obsessed ? " - then presented them with a simple cure ( " How Science Will Let You Change Your Personality with a Pill " ) . The idea was that shyness , absentmindedness , and a host of other routine traits were medical conditions best treated by drugs . " For the first time in human history , " the neuropsychiatrist Richard Restak announced , " we will be in a position to design our own brain . " Pharmacology would let us design brains unafraid of eating alone in restaurants , signing checks in public , and using public restrooms ( the principal characteristics of social phobia ) . // Newsweek may not be as exacting as Clinical Psychopharmacology , but its coverage is part of a trend offering breathtakingly simple explanations and remedies for our emotional and social problems . Our culture has swallowed this trend with few questions or concerns about side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixes and the illusion of pain-free remedies for complex , enigmatic problems . // This outcome may also be tied to our distance from sources in the past that had different-often , better-explanations for anxiety and its remedies . But pathologizing shyness only aggravates that loss . If the Samson story is merely a parable of antisocial personality disorder , then it is no longer a tale of betrayal , or of man 's relation to a higher spiritual authority , or even of his sexual vulnerabilities . Still , if we accept the glib logic of Newsweek , all we need undergo is " a kind of psychopharmacological plastic surgery . " // In his bestseller Listening to Prozac , Peter Kramer called aspects of this emerging field " cosmetic psychopharmacology " and worried that they conveyed a strong , perhaps unrealistic demand for mood brightening . But it 's doubtful so many Americans would be taking antidepressants for stage fright , fear of public bathrooms , and other routine matters if psychiatrists and the DSM had n't first convinced them that these behaviors were aspects of a serious mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transhistorical argument . What of the cross-cultural one ? // Those saying social phobia is global sometimes point to a short ( four-page ) essay that Kutaiba Chaleby published in 1987 . The piece , " Social Phobia in Saudis , " was based on 35 outpatients he observed at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh . And while those apparently " met the DSM-III criteria of social phobia " ( which we 'll investigate more thoroughly in the next chapter ) Chaleby had to concede , halfway through his paper , that of that group " only 22 ( 63% ) actually presented with social phobia. " // Most people would find it awkward to generalize about a large country from 22 patients . Yet Chaleby has no qualms about writing , two paragraphs later : " The high incidence of social phobia in Saudi Arabia is the first observation worthy of discussion . Is there a genetic predisposition ? " // Based on his research , Chaleby swiftly pronounces social phobia more common in Saudi Arabia than in England . " Western literature indicates , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disorders affect less than 1% of a given population ... However , in Saudi Arabia social phobia occurs more frequently . Our outpatient clinic statistics indicate that it represents about 12-13% of the neurotic disorders seen . " Anyone dazzled by this claim must ignore Chaleby 's rather painful admission , in the next paragraph , that " four of his case records were lost . " They also must overlook how small a group 12 percent of his sample represents . //
