Dear Dr. Cory : I have ringworm . I have had it on and off over the past year . I ca n't seem to get rid of it . Can you give me some advice ? I 'm a wrestler and I wrestle a lot . I am treating it with Lotrimin AF ( Anti-Fungal ) . Craig Pokorny Omaha , Nebraska Dear Craig : Ringworm , a type of fungus , can be a very stubborn infection to fight . It can infect the scalp , the feet ( athlete 's foot ) , the groin area , and other parts of the body . It particularly likes warm , moist areas , which is why it is very important to keep the skin clean and dry when fighting and preventing ring-worm . This can be difficult to do when you play a sport that causes you to sweat a lot or wear equipment that does n't allow the air to circulate around your skin , such as athletic supporters or sweaty socks and shoes . An antifungal cream like Lotrimin AF should eventually clear ringworm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks or more for the infection to clear up . ( Scalp infections require a prescription medication taken by mouth . ) It is very important to continue using the medicine until the rash has completely cleared . Otherwise the fungus might return and grow again . Be sure to wash your hands before and after applying medication . Keep fingernails short and avoid scratching to keep the infection from spreading . Shower frequently and change underwear and socks daily , or more often if they get sweaty . To avoid infecting others , do n't share clothing items or towels . If your infection becomes chronic or severe , your doctor may need to prescribe a liquid or tablet antifungal medication . Or if it shows signs of a secondary bacterial infection , antibiotics may be prescribed , although this is rare . // Sight Night Last Halloween , many volunteers across the country went door to door and collected 33,000 pairs of used eyeglasses to support Give the Gift of Sight 's international optical missions .
