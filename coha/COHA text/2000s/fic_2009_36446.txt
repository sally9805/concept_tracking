Washington : The Capitol <p> The crowd surging along the barriers that blocked off the Capitol steps was on the verge of turning ugly . It was much larger than the Capitol Police had anticipated and growing bigger by the minute . At first it had been orderly , well organized , mostly women of various ages led by earnest young men in dark suits and narrow ties who shouted their directions through electric bullhorns . Their permits were all in order and they patiently submitted to searches by the special antiterrorism squad and their bomb-sniffing dogs . <p> The placards they carried were professionally printed in red , white , and blue . <p> NO MONSTERS ! DO N'T INTERFERE WITH GOD 'S WORK STEM CELL RESEARCH KILLS BABIES MARSHAK IS A BABY KILLER <p> But now a different sort of crowd was pouring in , men and women , older for the most part , lots of gray hair and bald heads , many in wheelchairs . They were being searched , too , before being allowed across the broad parking area in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , many of them hand-lettered . <p> DO N'T CONDEMN ME FOR LIFE TO THIS WHEELCHAIR I NEED A NEW HEART MY BABY IS DYING . PLEASE HELP ME ! <p> The demonstrators marched up and down the parking area outside the Capitol steps , chanting slogans and counterslogans . <p> " Marshak does the devil 's work ! " <p> " Marshak is a gift from God ! " <p> " Marshak ... Marshak ... Mar-shak ... Mar-shak ! " <p> Now TV news vans were pulling up , like sharks drawn to blood , camera crews focusing on the placards and the marching , chanting , shouting , red-faced demonstrators . <p> The sky overhead was a clear summer blue , although the morning traffic had already raised a smoggy haze on the streets . Security choppers buzzed overhead ; no news media helicopters were allowed near the Capitol . A hot , muggy July morning in the nation 's capital ; it would have been a slow Monday , news-wise , except for the demonstration . Knots of picketers began to cluster around each of the camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Captain Wally Lewis watched it all from the top of the Capitol steps with a sour frown on his dark fleshy face . <p> " Better call the Army , " he said into his handheld radio . <p> The little speaker crackled . " You mean you ca n't handle a few yahoos ? " <p> Lewis grimaced . " There 's more'n a few . " Squinting through the pollution haze past the Supreme Court building up toward the roadblock on Maryland Avenue where incoming buses were stopped and searched , he added , " And more busloads heading this way . " <p> " How many more ? " <p> " Six . . . eight ... must be a dozen I can see from here . Plenty of nuts in with them . " Then Lewis added , " Some terrorist outfit could use ' em for cover . " <p> " You see any A-rabs among ' em ? " <p> " Like they 're gon na wear turbans and bushy beards , " Lewis grumbled . <p> " You 're overreacting , Wally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veteran , Lewis said into his radio , " These people are gon na turn nasty , I tell you . I can feel it in my bones . " <p> " The hearing 's over at the Rayburn Building , ai n't it ? Dumb shits do n't even know where it 's happening . " <p> " Do n't matter where the hearings are , " said Lewis . " If there 's a riot it 's gon na be right here . " <p> " Who in hell would 've thought people 'd get this worked up over some science stuff ? " In the tiny radio speaker his supervisor sounded more surprised than annoyed . <p> " Yeah , " said Lewis . Then he added silently , Who in hell ? <p> Excerpted from The Immoratality Factor by Ben Bova . Copyright 2009 by Ben Bova . Published in April 2009 by Tom Doherty Associates ,
