<p> WHEN Stephen Szczepanek invites people to his loft on the border of Greenpoint and Williamsburg in Brooklyn , he sends them a two-page e-mail message with four different sets of directions for finding him . There are driving instructions from Manhattan for both the Williamsburg and Queensboro Bridges and walking routes from the L train , which stops at Bedford Avenue , and from the G train , which stops at Nassau Avenue . <p> Gentrification has made working-class Greenpoint safer , hipper and pricier since Mr. Szczepanek ( pronounced suh-PAN-eck ) moved here 22 years ago , but it has n't made it more accessible . " We have the G train now , but you have to wait 10 minutes between trains , " he said . " It 's the longest 10 minutes of your life . " <p> HABITATS/Greenpoint , Brooklyn <p> Fortunately for Mr. Szczepanek , he does n't have to commute to Manhattan , because he works from his loft , which doubles as a showroom for selling antique Japanese folk textiles . He calls his business Sri , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Like many of his neighbors , Mr. Szczepanek , 48 , came to New York to be an artist . He grew up in Reading , Pa. , and was initially attracted to this part of Brooklyn because he could afford a place to live with enough room for him to paint . " It was cheap and dicey , " he recalled . " It was embarrassing to invite anyone over because it was so low-rent . You would have to take the bus after you took the subway . I knew no one would ever come to visit me , and they did n't . " <p> He first found an old bar on the south side of Williamsburg that he turned into what he calls a " quasi loft , " and lived there for five years . " Bedford Avenue was a ghost town then , " said Mr. Szczepanek , whose first job in New York was mixing paints for the man who printed Andy Warhol 's silk-screens . " I had to walk 11 blocks to get home . I had to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He moved to a top-floor apartment in a three-family house in the heavily Italian north side of Williamsburg . " I lived there for 10 years , and I never had a lease , " he said . " For five years , my landlord did not even raise the rent . And then one day I got a phone call that he wanted me out . I felt like I was walking off a gangplank . " <p> Three years ago , he rented his current apartment , a bare-bones 1,200-square-foot loft with exposed pipes , quotidian kitchen appliances and a no-frills bathroom that looks over a " courtyard " that used to be the loading dock . " My neighbor is a good friend , and she brought me into the building , " he said . " It was kind of magical . It 's a really happy building . Most of the residents are artists . " <p> Mr. Szczepanek is dismayed by the upscaling of his neighborhood , but he is aware that longtime residents looked at him 20 years ago the way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbol of change when I moved here , " he said . <p> His favorite shopping strip remains Manhattan Avenue , which is pretty much the same as it was when he arrived . " It is still all mom-and-pop shops , " he said . " There is even a store that mostly sells pins and snaps . " <p> From his windows , Mr. Szczepanek can see a nightly light show of traffic whizzing by on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway two and half blocks away . " But all this new construction is going to block my view , " he said sadly . <p> He is confounded by the building boom enveloping him . " Greenpoint is the new Flushing , " he said wryly . " All these floor-to-ceiling windows ! All these new apartments with terraces that people only use for storing their bicycles ! I remember when there was a relationship between architecture and place . The new buildings have names like Aqua and Park View . They are out of scale . " <p> He finds sanctuary in his uncluttered loft and the cloth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faraway time and place without having to leave home ( although he does go to Japan on buying trips twice a year , visiting dealers and temple markets in Kyoto on what he calls busman 's holidays ) . " What I love is that there is so much history in every piece , " he said . " These are the normal people 's textiles . " <p> He buys textiles from the Meiji era ( 1868 to 1912 ) , as well as from the years just before and after . Mr. Szczepanek explains that before the Meiji era , poor people in Japan were not allowed to wear silk . " They could not wear bold patterns or bright colors , either , " he said . " The things I sell are mostly hemp , cotton and ramie . " <p> Hanging on his walls like abstract paintings are a boro indigo futon cover and a boro yogi , or sleeping kimono . " ' Boro ' is a term now widely recognized that describes these patched and mended fabrics , " said Mr. Szczepanek , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces and writes scholarly articles about them . " The Japanese are inveterate recyclers . They understood the value of cloth . " <p> As he talks about the fabrics , he becomes increasingly animated . " This is how the Japanese mind works , " he said reverentially . " The Japanese were so poor . They were an indigenous people with a superrefined design sense . They would use anything to make fabric . But what they made was never meant to be seen . There was no intention to reference modernist art . " <p> He had no intention of becoming a textiles dealer , either . For a decade , Mr. Szczepanek was the curator of 2,000-piece private collection that focuses on Asian art and 20th-century design . His job afforded him access to museum collections in China , India and Japan and a hands-on education . <p> In 2001 , he quit to make a career of antique fabrics . " I just started buying cloth , and then I thought I would make home accessories out of it , " he said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , placemats and pillows , and I sold them to Takashimaya . " <p> By examining how the kimonos were made , he developed an appreciation for their artistry . He began to meet collectors and realized that Japanese textiles were more valuable and beautiful in their original state . His clients include graphic artists , textile designers and collectors of folk and outsider art . <p> " I sell a lot to Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein  --  not them personally , but to their companies , " he said . " The fashion world is always looking for inspiration . " <p> Mr. Szczepanek finds it easier and more enjoyable to sell textiles than his own paintings , which he has not made for a decade . " It 's easy to promote this stuff , " he said . " It 's interesting and not about me . It is art without an artist . There is no ego there , and I think that is what people respond to . It is art in my understanding of art  --  what excites the mind and the eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @
