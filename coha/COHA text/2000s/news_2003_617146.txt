<p> When the film version of " Cold Mountain , " Charles Frazier 's best-selling Civil War-era novel , opens Christmas Day , people all over the world will wonder if there really is such a place . Cold Mountain is 40 miles from Asheville , N.C. , and it is part of the Shining Rock Wilderness Area in Pisgah National Forest . <p> But that 's not where director Anthony Minghella filmed the story . Instead , he and a cast that includes Jude Law , Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger traveled to Romania . <p> Since the real Cold Mountain is government owned , it is still in its natural state ( much as it was during the Civil War ) and requires a strenuous 10-mile hike to reach its 6,030-foot summit . However , you can enjoy beautiful views of the mountain from your car via the Blue Ridge Parkway or a shorter hike to the top of Mount Pisgah . <p> Mark File of RomanticAsheville.com says the easiest way to see Cold Mountain is from the Blue Ridge Parkway at Milepost 412 , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south side of Cold Mountain from an overlook near the U.S. 276 exchange at Milepost 411.9 . The views from the overlook are spotty , with overgrown trees mostly blocking it . For the best view , go to the Wagon Gap Road parking area at Milepost 412.2 . Then walk north on the parkway a short distance . <p> A more extensive view is from the top of Mount Pisgah ( 5,700 feet ) , at Milepost 407 on the Blue Ridge Parkway , 26 miles southwest of Asheville . A three-mile round-trip trail takes you to the top for a grand view of Cold Mountain . The hike is a bit strenuous , but File says the view will be a nice reward . <p> You may want to wait until spring to enjoy either view , since this section of the Blue Ridge Parkway is closed for much of the winter . <p> For photographs and more information about hiking to its summit , **25;4672;TOOLONG . <p> A touch of Di <p> " Diana , A Celebration " opens Friday in Toronto , and visitors can take advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life and work of Diana , Princess of Wales .
