<p> Brian Chesnut calls the death of his grandfather the most painful event of his 19-year-old life , a trauma he said molded him into a stronger person . The Coppin State freshman plans to draw on that experience as he approaches what he anticipates will be his second-greatest ordeal : the Eagles ' nonconference schedule . <p> There are grueling schedules , which Coppin State Coach Ron " Fang " Mitchell assembles annually , and then there is this season 's lineup , so barbed with obstacles that some coaches tabbed it " insane " and " scary . " Today , when the Eagles play Charlotte in the BCA Invitational in Laramie , Wyo. , they begin a two-month journey no men 's basketball team has attempted in recent memory . <p> By the time Coppin State plays its first home game Jan. 14 , the Eagles will have played 14 road games , including nine against schools from traditionally powerful conferences . When New Year 's arrives , they will already have logged 17,820 air miles . Coach Tom Izzo , whose Michigan State team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toughest nonconference schedule he has ever seen . <p> " Are you kidding me ? " Izzo said after a reporter recited the 11 nonconference games . " I 'd rather play the Lakers and Celtics because at least you get a home game . Wow , that is insane . . . . I 'm not sure you are ever good enough to handle the kind of schedule you just gave me . I 'd like to see how the Lakers would do with that schedule . " <p> Coppin State , a Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference school in Baltimore , has a team composed of 11 freshmen or sophomores and no seniors . Its only hope to reach the NCAA tournament , which it has done three times under Mitchell , is to win the MEAC tournament , the most important week of its season . <p> One reason Mitchell amassed such a schedule is to foster fearlessness in players for the postseason . Another reason , he acknowledged , is financial . Low- and mid-major programs typically help support their athletic budgets by playing road games in return for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Mitchell , who is also the school 's athletic director , said Coppin State will receive almost $500,000 in guaranteed money this season , a sizeable amount for an athletic department with a budget of just more than $3 million . The largest single payout , he said , is roughly $65,000 . <p> Mitchell , 57 , said he also receives a percentage of the money in lieu of an athletic director 's salary ; he declined to divulge the percentage . Both Izzo and Coach Ben Betts , whose South Carolina State team competes in the MEAC , said it is somewhat common for coaches at low- and mid-major programs to receive a portion of the money for guaranteed games even when they are n't in a dual role like Mitchell . <p> " I 'm dealing with young people , " Mitchell said . " I 'm dealing with motivation . I do n't need to get into confrontations on why I am doing things , if you understand what I mean . We 're doing things for the reason of trying to toughen them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coppin State , acknowledged he could n't afford to construct such a schedule if job security was an issue . " The athletic director is a real good friend of mine , " he joked . <p> Many coaches at the low- and mid-major level would n't consider putting together a schedule that almost certainly will result in at least 10 losses before conference play begins . <p> " You 've got to get wins , " Loyola Coach Jimmy Patsos said . " If you do n't win , you get fired . They 'll still fire me at Loyola if we do n't win . " <p> To a man , Coppin State players treat their schedule as a badge of honor and are enthused about playing teams that they have watched on television for years . Some , including Chesnut and freshman Chuckie Ivey , said the schedule was a prime reason why they committed to Coppin State . <p> To visualize the possibilities , players can merely walk into their coach 's office and glance at the walls , which are adorned with framed photos of Coppin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eagles upset second-seeded South Carolina in the first round of the NCAA tournament . <p> In the spirit of that ' 97 team , several Coppin State players said every game on their schedule is winnable . When pressed , two acknowledged looking over the nonconference games and thinking only " a couple " are winnable . In all , Coppin State will face a nonconference schedule composed of teams that won 68 percent of their games last season . <p> " The home team paying the money wins 96 percent of the games , " Patsos said . " I 'm pretty sure it 's an accurate stat . " <p> Asked how many nonconference victories would be considered a success , Ivey replied , " More than zero . " Mitchell essentially agreed , explaining in his raspy voice that players should not be intimidated . <p> " What are they going to do ? " Mitchell said . " Shoot us ? Hit us over the head ? We 're there for what ? To play basketball . How rough can that be ? " <p> Mitchell calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must make sure his players ' confidence is not broken beyond repair by New Year 's , even though the number in the team 's loss column likely will grow from week to week . <p> Sophomore Darryl Proctor , who played a difficult schedule last season , acknowledged that " between the crowd and the score going up and up and up , you have to play with confidence . . . . Sometimes when you 're getting kicked and losing every time , that stuff brings your confidence down and you start questioning yourself and the skill level of your team . " <p> ESPN analyst Jay Bilas pointed to the philosophy of Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim , which is to learn through winning , albeit against relatively easy nonconference competition . " If you just get used to getting blasted and you walk into your conference schedule beaten up and bloodied and underconfident , " Bilas said , " then maybe it 's not the best thing . " <p> Mitchell , on the other hand , said he sees the basketball court offering lifelong lessons and memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Yes , it 's going to get them ; yes , it 's going to put a strain on them . But does it make them tougher in life ? And that is the way they are going to have to be to survive out here , that 's the way the world is today . If they 've been protected all their lives , Mom ca n't help them , Dad ca n't help them out here . It 's going to be us against them . And it might be like it was at Kentucky last year  --  23,000 of them . " <p> Mitchell usually schedules as least one game at home to break up the consecutive road games , but a quirk in the schedule forced the move of a conference game to the end of the regular season . This season he did not even schedule a home exhibition game . <p> Players said they would have preferred at least one early home game for the fans . Some players have lost count how many times students in class ask when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Their response : " Patience . " <p> Tulane , whose campus was ravaged by Hurricane Katrina , has been displaced to the Texas A &M; campus for the fall semester but will play its first home game Dec. 27 , almost three weeks before Coppin State . And Baylor , whose nonconference schedule was eliminated because of NCAA sanctions , will play its first home game the same day Coppin State makes its home debut , Jan. 14 . <p> " That 's scary , " Patsos said . <p> Mitchell would consider scheduling a Division II team to give his team a better chance to earn at least one early victory , but he said the conference does not allow it . " Let us buy a victory , " he said of the chance to bring in a Division II team . " Everyone else has been buying us . " <p> Fourteen straight road games also means an inordinate amount of travel and scheduling logistics that have been coordinated by the team 's business manager , Danielle Richard , who says she has " tunnel vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means loads of schoolwork that has to be completed on planes , buses and in hotels . In fact , Chesnut recently groaned about a 15-page paper , the longest assignment he has ever received , due at month 's end . <p> Whatever happens the next two months , Chesnut said , he and his teammates will be forever changed , strengthened in character even if defeated on the court . <p> " A lot of teams would break apart , start pointing fingers , " Chesnut said . " As long as we stay strong  --  we 're a close team  --  it 's like a brotherhood . Just understand it takes some battle scars to go through life , to go through the trials and tribulations , but win or lose , we go through it as a team . "
