<p> The state 's top law enforcement officer said for the first time Thursday that the Jefferson County Sheriff 's Office missed an early opportunity to investigate one of the Columbine killers , a squandered chance that could have prevented the deadly rampage . <p> Reporting on the preliminary results of a four-month investigation of the sheriff 's department , Attorney General Ken Salazar said deputies should have asked a judge for the right to seek evidence at Eric Harris ' home as they looked for signs he was building pipe bombs a year before the April 20 , 1999 , shootings . <p> ' There should have been a search warrant executed on the Harris home , ' Salazar said . <p> Current and retired detectives interviewed and quoted in Salazar 's report place much of the blame on former Lt. John Kiekbusch , long the boogeyman of parents who have heaped criticism on the Sheriff 's Office for failing to get the search warrant for Harris ' home . <p> In his address to the public , Salazar stopped short of outlining how the failure occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was viewed by some as a vindication of Randy Brown and his family , who have long contended that the Sheriff 's Office could have - and should have - more aggressively investigated their complaints about Harris . <p> ' If you 're a police officer , do your job , ' Randy Brown said . <p> The 39-page report 's release came on a day when the public was allowed for the first time to see evidence collected in the aftermath of Columbine . Salazar 's investigation began in October , after a sheriff 's deputy cleaning a home office in advance of a dinner party discovered a report showing that a colleague had been told in 1997 of a violent Web page created by Harris . <p> That 1997 report came as a revelation to Columbine families who had long been told that the Sheriff 's Office 's first warning about Harris came seven months later , in March 1998 . <p> Salazar determined that the first warning authorities received about Harris came from one of Brown 's children , who requested anonymity at the time , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The complaint itself was ultimately shoved in a binder at the Sheriff 's Office and forgotten . <p> But Salazar was critical of former Sheriff John Stone , saying his office should have acted more strongly on the various warnings deputies were receiving . <p> Stone did not return a reporter 's call requesting comment . <p> Salazar 's investigation found that sheriff 's deputies were involved with or received information about Harris or Dylan Klebold or both seven times in the months before Columbine . <p> Deputies directly encountered Harris and Klebold in January 1998 , when they caught them breaking into a van . A deputy also once stopped Klebold on a stop- <p> light violation . Klebold 's attitude , a police report says , was ' good . ' <p> The remaining five incidents involve property damage from a snowball and a paintball , a prank phone call , the 1997 website warning , and similar warnings about the website and its discussion of pipe bombs filed in March 1998 . <p> The contacts related to the March 1998 warning remain the source of great controversy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judy Brown , whose son Brooks was singled out by Harris on the Web page and threatened . <p> Brooks was n't injured in the shootings . <p> The Web page mentions four pipe bombs that Harris and Klebold had constructed . Deputies investigating the Web page were already aware of a pipe bomb found in a park near Harris ' house that seemed to resemble bombs described on the Web page . <p> Deputies drafted an affidavit to seek a judge 's approval for a search warrant , but , detectives quoted in Salazar 's report say , Lt. Kiekbusch wanted more proof - in the form of an eyewitness - that Harris had made such devices . <p> Sgt. Randy West told Salazar 's investigators that Kiekbusch was a difficult man to argue with on such matters . <p> ' Kiekbusch is kind of inflexible , whether he is right , wrong or indifferent , ' West told investigators . ' You either played along or you did n't play . ' <p> Some experts Thursday questioned Kiekbusch 's alleged insistence on an eyewitness . William Erickson , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was revealed Thursday ' showed a failure ( by the sheriff 's department ) to consider or even recognize that the materials turned over by the Browns could have prevented this act from occurring . ' <p> In interviews with Salazar 's investigators , the detective who sought the warrant in 1998 , Mike Guerra , did not blame Kiekbusch for his failure to get permission to search Harris ' home . <p> ' He may have shown the affidavit to Lt. Kiekbusch , but he was n't sure , ' the report says . ' He said that he could have , as Kiekbusch was a stickler for knowing what was going on in his unit . ' <p> No one knows what deputies might have found in Harris ' home in 1998 . But he bragged repeatedly of keeping weapons and bomb-making materials , and the sheer volume of weaponry unveiled Thursday is indicative of a long planning and assembly process . <p> Kiekbusch declined a reporter 's request for an interview Thursday , and Salazar said the former lieutenant , now in Washington , D.C. , provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last October , Kiekbusch said the search warrant was not approved because the department dealt with thousands of threats each year involving teenagers - but that the great majority of them were frivolous . <p> Salazar is continuing to investigate to find Guerra 's file on the case , which disappeared from his desk shortly after the shootings , reappeared , and is now missing again . <p> Members of the Brown family were grateful for Salazar 's report but outraged at the repeated failures by Jefferson County deputies to aggressively investigate their complaints in a long-running dispute with Harris . <p> Brian Rohrbough , whose son Daniel was killed in the attack , said he is convinced that Salazar 's investigation has uncovered far more information about Jefferson County 's failures than Salazar was willing to release Thursday . <p> ' I have information that they ( the Jefferson County Sheriff 's Office ) were provided that is not included in this report that is very , very significant , ' Rohrbough said . ' It 's just a question of when we release it . I believe it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After Salazar 's release of the report , Tom Mauser , father of slain student Daniel Mauser , said , ' There are still a lot of things we do n't understand . There were many signs that the Sheriff 's Office missed . <p> ' If we 're going to learn a lesson from this , the key point would be why did law enforcement stop when they did ? ' <p> Randy Brown 's son , Brooks , was angry that the report showed that Investigator John Healy successfully found Harris ' domain name on American Online , which led to his website . He said that the site contained Harris ' recipes for making pipe bombs , descriptions and dimensions of his pipe bombs , and the names he gave each of them . <p> Investigators later searched a field and found fragments of exploded pipe bombs with the same markings and lettering that Harris displayed on his website , Brown said . <p> Brooks Brown said that was enough evidence for police to arrest Harris . ' They told us a massive lie that they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' They could have prevented this ( massacre ) . ' <p> ' I believe there were enough contacts that the law enforcement officers had every reason in the world to believe the Browns , ' Rohrbough said , referring to the pleas from the Brown family that Harris was not only prone to violence but was actually threatening to kill Brooks . <p> ' There was one family trying to save my son 's life and not a single police officer .
