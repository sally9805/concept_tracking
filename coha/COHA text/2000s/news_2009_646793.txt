In its attempt to reinvent basic , affordable , fuel-efficient transportation , Nissan might well have reinvented the cheap car  --  in every sense . <p> Nissan announced last year that it would field a $9,990 base version of the Versa small car , stripped of almost all accessories and powered by a smaller , cheaper engine and transmission . <p> The test car was $10,990 because it included air conditioning . Even the base car , thanks to $685 shipping , is n't really less than $10,000 . <p> Distressingly , the test car was a riot of creaks from the instrument panel , worse when cold , less so as the outside temperature rose or the car 's heater got busy . A center panel atop the dashboard was loose , but holding it down did n't bring quiet . <p> Nissan fetched the car for a look-see . A dealer  --  bet you 've never heard this one  --  could n't duplicate the noise , a rubbing-plastic sound the auto industry colorfully refers to as " itching . " <p> " If it was prevalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not hearing it , " says Al Castignetti , Nissan brand 's U.S. general manager . " It 's one of our most trouble-free cars . " <p> Still , be sure your test drive is when the car 's cold . <p> A combination squeak/clunk also came from the vicinity of the rear suspension near the end of the test . The clutch threw in its own groan now and then . <p> The upholstery looked like a threadbare couch cover . Sharp plastic edges made it dangerous to grope in the instrument panel 's cubby . The back seat was as uncomfortably firm as a park bench . <p> Big disappointments , because the idea of a new car  --  warranty , fresh smell and all  --  at a used car price appeals . Especially in these uncertain times . <p> In its favor , the Versa 1.6 was pleasant to drive , even satisfying , if you ignore the noises . <p> The inelegant front seats , for instance , were remarkably comfortable . Cheap-looking climate-control knobs nonetheless worked with a snappy click . The turn-signal lever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The brittle-looking steering wheel had just enough " give " that it was pleasant to grip . <p> As long as you did n't mind a bit of body lean , the base Versa snapped around corners like a machine with sportier credentials . Steering , hard for most automakers to get just right , was close to dead-on . There was enough feel that you were n't a stranger to the road , enough power assist that you did n't feel put-upon . <p> And , an advantage of all Versas sedans , base and otherwise , legroom in back was adult-sized . That 's been a reason to pick the Nissan instead of its rivals since Versa was launched as a 2007 model . <p> The five-speed manual transmission shifted easily , but the throw from gear to gear was long . <p> The clutch took longer to master than expected , penalizing the driver with jerks and jumps until a smooooooth left-leg manner was developed . <p> Things of importance , rather than indulgence , that you sacrifice on this stripped-down vehicle have " power " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only . More than a mere nuisance , at least in urban/suburban areas where you often pass through toll booths or drop a window on the passenger 's side to shout a final instruction as Junior dashes toward the school . <p> Sometimes getting a window up or down fast is a safety issue , as when you 're approached in a parking lot by an unsavory sort and you ca n't squirm and reach back far enough to crank up the passenger-side window your kids left down . <p> *Power locks . Nope again . And what a pain . Lock or unlock each one individually . Locking 's not so bad . Open each door , flip the lock lever and close . ( And , yes , the driver 's door works that way , too , so you easily can lock the keys inside the car , which is tough to do with today 's power locks . ) <p> Unlocking 's awkward . The only keyhole is on the driver 's side , so you have to start by opening that door with the key . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seat and the door pillar to fumble for the lock on the back door . Flip it and open the door to toss in your briefcase . Get in and stretch clear across the interior to unlatch the passenger doors so the other passengers can climb in . <p> Park at work , circle the car to open , lock and close each door . It 's such a bother you 're tempted to skip it . Then it 's a safety issue  --  that unsavory character now can lurk inside your car to mug you . <p> *Power mirrors . If you are the only driver , fine . You 'll push and tug the mirrors into place once and leave them . But if others use the car , they probably wo n't bother  --  another potential safety issue . <p> *Power . The 1.6-liter engine has a modest 107 horsepower . That 's plenty for driving alone with not much baggage , but marginal when you add several riders or lots of cargo and try to merge onto an interstate . Not like the old Volkswagen microbus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forethought nonetheless . <p> Nissan 's idea was good , it 's execution not so much , judging by the test car . But even with top-drawer execution , a feature-challenged sedan might be a tough sell , even these days , because lots are full of nearly new , well-equipped used cars . <p> The late Roger Smith , CEO of General Motors in the 1980s , was ridiculed when he said back then that the right rival for an inexpensive import car " is a two-year-old Buick . " He might have been right . <p> 2009 Nissan Versa 1.6 <p> *What ? No-frills version of the small , front-drive , four-door sedan .
