Like many folks with grandkids at a distance , Michael Harbater , 55 , had a hunger to know those little people better  --  and to have them know him . But for the retailer from New York City , it was hard . Eleven of his 16 grandchildren lived in Israel , and when he did see them , he laments , " they did n't exactly jump into my lap . " <P> But Harbater had one great tool for bridging that divide : his airplane . Although he could not fly his six-seat Centurian across the Atlantic , he was able to fly his visiting 21/2-year-old granddaughter from Farmingdale , N.Y. , to Toronto . Squirming on her mom 's lap , Liba stretched out her arms toward him , plaintively wailing " Gampa ! " Harbater took her onto his lap , cradling her with one hand while piloting the plane . She snuggled against him , fascinated by the colored lights blinking on the instrument panel and the rain streaking back on the windshield . " It was like a dream come true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year later Liba still talks about " Gampa 's airpane . " <P> With today 's families scattered so widely , a growing number of grandparents have learned to close two gaps  --  geographic and emotional  --  with one airplane , either by flying the miles that separate them from their grandkids or by bonding with the young ones through a passion for flying . Often the grandparents do both . The average age of civilian pilots has risen to 55 , up from about 48 a decade ago , as more grandparents have taken to the pilot 's seat , according to Drew Steketee , CEO of Be a Pilot , a nonprofit that promotes aviation . Around 10% of the would-be flyers who signed up in 2003 and ' 04 for Be a Pilot 's promotional first lesson ( $49 ) were over 50 . Considering that many pilots over 80 are still active , boomers who start now could be flying for decades . <P> In the past , says Karen Fingerman , a Purdue University psychologist , grandparents ' typical roles were as family historians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " grandparents tend to be healthier , society is less formal , and the passions transmitted can include modern , hip pastimes like biking , running and even flying planes . " <P> Whichever comes first  --  the grandkids or the license  --  many grandparents view flying as a godsend for bonding with their children 's children . " Flying is my special thing that I can pass on to them , " says retired nurse Betty Vinson , 64 , of Prince George , Va. , who took up flying at 50 . Vinson takes her three grandkids , ages 4 to 13 , aloft regularly . From toddlerhood , they have loved it . " Years later , " Vinson says , " my granddaughter would talk about flying right through clouds and how they were not solid but soft like smoke . " The first time Gary Spoor , 48 , took up Garrett , 4 , the boy was transfixed . " Look , Grandpa , " he called , " there 's a train ! Look  --  cows ! " " It makes me feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " says the power-line superintendent from Kansas City , Mo .
