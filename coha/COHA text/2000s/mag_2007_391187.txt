Headnote If football is war by other means , Albany , New York , is Parris Island . Day One FOR A CERTAIN KIND OF MAN , the opening of training camp is a tent-pole in the family calendar , a luminif erous day right up there alongside Memorial Day and Thanksgiving and somewhat ahead of the wife 's birthday . Each summer this kind of man packs the bag and hauls the wagon to some remote village where he and 80 players and a few hundred coulda-been players get down to the business of football . Albany , New York , is such a place . It may be the capital of an important state , but if s more Brasilia than Paris , a bureaucratic outpost built by former Gov . Nelson Rockefeller as his personal monument to big-government Republicanism . Rock/s ambition was to fill every one of those new offices with a state employee and , by golly , he seems to have pulled it off . Night life in Albany ? If s pretty much confined to the late shift at Burger Kin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their evenings are devoted to the parsing of lineups and the swapping of memories . I have been studying these strange men for many years and feel that I understand them well . By 7:15 in the morning we are settled in the tiny grandstand , a couple of dozen strangers who share the odd coincidence of having seen every play of every New York Giants game played in the last 20 years . Some of these guys look familiar . I would n't recognize them in New York or D.C , and I could n't tell you their names even here , but at training camp they are friends quickly made . To gain entry to the charmed circle requires only that you first swipe the card-contributing a story , an anecdote , even some high-quality RS. about the greatest player who ever played . That of course would be Lawrence Taylor . LT , the ultimate warrior , a giant among Giants , a linebacker fast enough to chase down little guys and strong enough to manhandle big guys . LT was The Man , with speed and power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always looking for the next LT and we are always disappointed . With the secret handshakes exchanged , the group turns quickly to logistics . The best place to stay ? A consensus emerges around the Days Inn , at 69 bucks a night including an all-you-can-eat ( and stuff-in-your-pants ) breakfast Lunch ? The Deli , which offers a thick , meat-like sandwich for $3.50 . Best seats ? These right here , baby , from which we can see all three practice fields and thus simulate the thrill of channel-surfing at home . ( As if the wife would ever let us do that . ) Great seats , thaf s why we 're out here at dawn , alone on a football field , looking to a bemused passerby like a crazed work-release crew . The players begin streaming onto the field and we clap and whistle . If s the beginning of a new season and a new dream . The coaches , who look like apack of Mini Me 's next to the padded players , fan out across the field , barking orders and waving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a running commentary from my bleacher brothers so profane and politically incorrect as to remind you of Don Imus before he scrambled back on the wagon . A sample , sanitized for your protection , gentle reader . Tom Coughlin , the Giants ' head coach , who is strung as tightly as a banjo , insists that his assistant coaches dress the same way he does . Thus the question , broadcast to the group , " Which one is Coughlin ? " Answer : Ws the one with the red ass . " ( When I could still drag my own sons to camp , I would explain to them that this camp-chat was how men used to talk back in ancient , pre-Oprah days . Camp , for my suburbanized boys , was like an archaeological dig . ) Day Two CASUAL OBSERVERS TEND TO THINK that football is about strength . Ifs not . Ifs about weakness . The other guy 's weakness . Every play is designed , first , to probe for weakness and then , when ifs exposed , to attack it repeatedly until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating another weakness . While ifs always good to have star players , in other words , ifs even more important to have consistently high quality from one end of the roster to the other . A team of good players will always beat a team of stars and slugs . The Giants have four potential weaknesses . Thaf s a lot on a team with only 22 starting players . The headline question is at quarterback , where still-young Eli Manning is entering his fourth and decisive year . He has the talent , with a long body and abig arm . He has the lineage , as the brotherof the ubiquitous Peyton and the son of the sainted Archie , both exceptional quarterbacks . He has the experience , after 20 wins and 19 losses as an NFL starter . And he has the incentive to perform , with a salary of $9.3 million for the 16-game season . But can he be an effective leader and execute the 30-40 key plays that will make or break the team this year ? Manning 's play will depend in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the nmning-back-bycommittee that will replace the retired Tiki Barber , whose brilliant running last year took considerable heat off Manning 's passing offense . Unless wannabes Jacobs , Droughns , Bradshaw , and Ward can replace Barber 's 1,600 yards , the pressure on still-young Eli Manning will ratchet upward . Of even more concern is the left tackle , the man whoblocks the opponents ' best rusher from the quarterback 's blind side ( Manning is righthanded ) . If the left tackle does n't block his man , still-young Eli Manning will be hit with great force by a 280-pound opponent chargingat full speed . Manningmay not get backup . This prospect makes the left tackle an important man , so important that on many teams he 's the highest-paid player after the quarterback . The Giants do n't have a left tackle . At today 's practice Coughlin is alternating two candidates with the first unit David Diehl , a veteran guard , is an adequate interior mauler but may lack the foot speed to play outside . Guy Whimper is a late-round draft choice from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which means that somewhere along the line a coach thought he saw potential Eager to get a sense of Diehl and Whimper , I approach them after practice . Diehl is big enough , seems intelligent , and has the swagger of a confident athlete . Maybe , just maybe . Whimper is all-country and a bit awkward . When he asks , " How 's it going ? " I suggest that it might go better if he changed his name to Guy Thunder . He snorts and two impressively large globs of mucus bulb from his nostrils . The other potential weakness is at cornerback , an " island " on which weakness can be neither hidden nor forgiven . Remember the old feminist line about Ginger Rogers , that she had to do everything Fred did but had to do it dancing backwards on high heels ? If the cornerback , while backpedaling , ca n't " mirror " the wide receiver , the other team scores easily- and the gaffe is instantly replayed on the Jumbo-screen for all to savor in slow motion . Tough position , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insupportably high self-esteem . Which brings up another easy subject-race , or as CNN might put it , Race in America ! I once got in trouble with the New York press for saying that football talk was the last honest race talk in the country . As an example , I said that when a football coach says , " He lacks quickness " what he really means is , " He 's white . " Whoo-whoo , call the thought cops . Well , let 's do a little field research , sport fans . When the various units break out for drills , there are 12 defensive backs , all preternaturale quick . And all black . Now who you gon na believe , some sensitivitytrained media goo-goo or your own lyin ' eyes ? ( Full disclosure-wise , I gave another example of honest race talk in that long-ago interview . I said that when a coach says , " He 's having a little trouble picking up our defensive schemes , " what he really means is , " He 's black . " For some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but maybe there should have been . It was out of bounds . ) The day ends with the first squad cuts , from which we campers always take small , atavistic satisfaction . In contemporary America , when you cut somebody from the squad , you say , " Chuck , in view of these difficult market conditions , management has been forced to downsize and , despite your many contributions to the organization , the budget numbers just do n't permit us to keep you on . This hurts us just as much as it hurts you , but remember , you 'll always be a member of our corporate family . " Football talk is different Something like , " Chuck , **37;1737;TOOLONG we do n't want you . You should leave now- and do n't steal the playbook on the way out " Day Three BIG DAY TODAY . We 're " putting on the pads , " which means that leather-popping , men-from-boys , mil-contact hitting is on the bill The prettiest sight a camper will ever see . A bigger than usual crowd begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , a few observations .... Camp is not quite men-only but close to it some of the men arriving in three-generation units ( bonding , as if bonding were notyet mandatory ) . The only women are the few moms filling in for missing dads and young , tightshirted women who seem more interested in the players- or at least the players ' cars- than the team . The tartest of the girls wear jerseys with " Shockey " on the back , the name of the Giants ' occasionally excellent and unfailingly randy tight end . The nice girls , both of them wear " Kiwanuka " jerseys , boosting linebacker Mathias Kiwanuka , a product of that great Uganda football program . And there 's a real collector 's item a home-stitched " Lorenzen . " Jared Lorenzen , a second-string passer , weighs 290 pounds and is either the new-new thing in pro quarterbacking or a really fat guy . Most of the females , young and old , buy programs . Noman , realorotherwise , wouldeverbuyaprogram.We wouldonlybe frustrated by the stupid errors . And there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers say has made a startling leap in national polls . We maybe in the heart of New York but we 're apparently nowhere near Hillary 's base . Even the women make derisory remarks , some of them flavored by rich Jersey accents . ( The so-called New York Giants actually play in Tony Soprano-land , a former swamp in north Jersey perfumed up as , would you believe it The Meadowlands . ) Then the team comes onto the field , stretches , and lines up for scrimmage . No coin toss , no pompoms , no kickoff . Just plays , one after another as each man tries to whip the man across from him . Some of the players are veterans , sure of a place on the team and toning up for the real games in the fall They are not exactly busting their butts . But most of the players are new or marginal or returning from injury or bunched up at a crowded position . Most of them are fighting for jobs and , if they come up short this afternoon , they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , in cold fact , they could be teaching phys ed next month at a high school in Alabama . In the drenching midsummer heat before a crowd of a few hundred onlookers , these men play with a ferocious intensity . Practice today is the biggest game of their young lives . They understand what we campers have long appreciated , that football is not just old school , but essentially binary , ravenous for result and impatient with process . If s a world where winners take all and losers are victimized If s probably not too much to say that football is war by other means . The journalist Robert Kaplan has written affectingIy on the loss of America 's warrior spirit He has reported some sobering facts . Only nine Princeton graduates from the class of 2006 entered the military , down from 400 in the post-war ( but still draft-prone ) class of 1956 . Only one member of the Stanford class of 2006 had a par ent in the military . Some Ivy League schools , according to Kaplan , had no graduates at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our governing and warrior classes , he avers , is almost complete , with potentially perilous consequences for the Republic . All of which makes it clearto us campers that football is notjust fun in the autumn sun . We have always considered it likely that football will save the nation . The practice ends with Manning flushed from the pocket and rolling right Off-balance , he throws across his body down the far sideline into a clutch of three tall defenders and one short receiver , a doomed , drivebusting play annoyingly familiar from seasons past . Interception . Young Eli , aging rapidly , along with his pride of unhappy campers . Sidebar " Chuck , the other players are better than you are and we do n't want you . You should leave now-and do n't steal the playbook on the way out . " Author Affiliation Neal B. Freeman is chairman of the Blackwell Corporation .
