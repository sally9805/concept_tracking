Chase Ryan doubted there was enough oxygen in the plane to get him from San Jose to Indianapolis . He took his window seat on the Boeing 737 , slid his laptop bag onto the floor space in front of him , and closed his eyes . Deep breaths , he told himself . Stay calm . But nothing about the job ahead of him inspired even a single peaceful feeling . On Monday Chase and his best friend Keith Ellison would set up shop in Bloomington , Indiana , and start spending millions of dollars of other people 's investment money to make a film they believed would change lives . <p> Even during the rare moments when that fact did n't terrify him , Chase could hear the quiet anxious voice of his wife , Kelly , splashing him with a cold bucket of reality . " Only two million dollars , Chase ? Seriously ? " She had brought it up again on the way to the airport . Her knuckles stayed white as she gripped the steering wheel . " What if you run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We wo n't . " Chase had steeled his eyes straight ahead . " Keith and I know the budget . " <p> " What if it does n't go like you planned ? " Her body was tense , her eyes fearful . She gave him quick , nervous glances . " If something happens , we 'll spend the rest of our lives paying that off . " <p> She was right , but he did n't want to say so . Not when it was too late to turn back . The actors were arriving on set in two days , and the entire film crew would be in Bloomington by tomorrow . Plans were in motion , and already bills needed to be paid . They had no choice but to move ahead and stick to their budget , trusting God that they could make this film for two million dollars , and illustrate a message of faith better and stronger than anything the industry had ever seen . <p> Failure was n't an option . <p> They reached the airport , but before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creasing the space between her eyebrows . She was only thirty-one , but lately she looked older . Maybe because she only seemed to smile when she was playing with their two little girls , Macy and Molly . Worry weighted her tone . " Four weeks ? " <p> " Hopefully sooner . " He refused to be anything but optimistic . <p> " You 'll call ? " <p> " Of course . Every day . " Chase studied her , and the familiar love was there . But her anxiety was something he did n't recognize . The faith she 'd shown back when they lived in Indonesia , that 's what he needed from her now . " Relax , baby . Please . " <p> " Okay . " She let out a sigh and another one seemed right behind it . " Why am I so afraid ? " <p> His heart went out to her . " Kelly ... " His words were softer than before , his tone desperate to convince her . " Believe in me ... believe in this movie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I 'm trying . " She looked down and it took awhile before she raised her eyes to his again . " It was easier in Indonesia . At least in the jungle the mission was simple . " <p> " Simple ? " He chuckled , but the sound lacked any real humor . " Indonesia was never easy . Any of us could 've been arrested or killed . We could 've caught malaria or a dozen different diseases . Every day held that kind of risk . " <p> The lines on her face eased a little and a smile tugged at her lips . She touched her finger to his face . " At least we had each other . " She looked deep into his eyes , to the places that belonged to only the two of them and she kissed him . " Come on , Chase ... you 've got ta see why I 'm worried . It 's not just the money . " <p> He caught a quick look at his watch . " You 're afraid we wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget and- " <p> " No . " She did n't raise her voice , but the fear in her eyes cut him short . " Do n't you see ? " Shame filled in the spaces between her words . " You 're young and handsome and talented ... " Her smile was sad now . " You 'll be working with beautiful actresses and movie professionals and ... I do n't know , the whole thing scares me . " <p> She did n't come out and admit her deeper feelings , those she 'd shared with him a week before the trip . The fact that she did n't feel she could measure up to the Hollywood crowd . Chase ached for her , frustrated by her lack of confidence . " This is n't about the movie industry . It 's about a bigger mission field than we ever had in Indonesia . " He wove his fingers into her thick dark hair , drew her close , and kissed her once more . " Trust me , baby . Please . " <p> This time she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes remained as he grabbed his bags and stepped away from the car . He texted her once he got through security , telling her again that he loved her and that she had nothing to worry about . But she did n't answer and now , no matter how badly he needed to sleep , he could n't shake the look on her face or the tone of her voice . What if her fears were some sort of premonition about the movie ? Maybe God was using her to tell Keith and him to pull out now-before they lost everything . <p> Once on the plane , he tightened his seatbelt and stared out the window . But then , Keith 's wife was completely on board with their plans . Her father was one of the investors , after all . Besides that , Keith 's daughter , Andi , was a freshman at Indiana University , so the shoot would give Keith a window to Andi 's world-something he was grateful for . Andi wanted to be an actress , and apparently her roommate was a theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film , so Keith 's entire family could hardly wait to get started . <p> Chase bit the inside of his lip . From the beginning , all the worries about the movie came from him and Kelly , but now that he was on his way to Indiana , Chase had to focus not on his fears , but on the film . <p> He ignored the knots in his stomach as he leaned against the cold hard plastic that framed the airplane window . The movie they were making was called The Last Letter , the story of a college kid whose life is interrupted when his father suffers a sudden fatal heart attack . The kid is n't sure how to move on until his mother reveals to him a letter-one last letter from his father . That letter takes Braden on a quest of discovery in faith and family , and finally into a brilliant future Braden had known nothing about . <p> The story was a parable , an illustration of the verse in Jeremiah 29:11 : " ' For I know the plans I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prosper you and not to harm you , plans to give you hope and a future . ' " The verse would be their mantra every day of the filming , Chase had no doubt . <p> He closed his eyes , and in a rush he could hear the music welling in his chest , feel the emotion as it filled a theater full of moviegoers . He could see the images as they danced across the big screen , and he could imagine all of it playing out beyond his wildest expectations . <p> But the way from here to there could easily be a million miles of rocky back roads and potholes . <p> They were still at the gate , still waiting for the plane to head out toward the runway . Chase blinked and stared out the window , beyond the airport to the blue sky . Every day this week had been blue , not a cloud in sight , something Chase and Keith both found fitting . Because no matter what Kelly feared , no matter what pressures came with this decision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and planned for , the culmination of a lifetime of believing that God wanted them to take part in saving the world-not on a mission field in Indonesia , but in packed movie houses across America . Oak River Films , they called themselves . The name came from their love of the first Psalm . Chase had long since memorized the first three verses : <p> Blessed is the man who does not walk not in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers . But his delight is in the law of the Lord , and on his law he meditates day and night . He is like a tree planted by streams of water , which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither . Whatever he does prospers . <p> Oak River Films . That everything he and Keith did would be rooted in a delight for the Lord , and a belief that if they planted their projects near the living water of Christ , they would flourish for Him . Chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Why was he worried about what lay ahead ? He believed God was sending them to make this movie , right ? He pressed his body into the thinly padded seat . Breathe . Settle down and breathe . <p> In every way that mattered , this film would make or break them in the world of Hollywood movie production . Easy enough , he had told himself when they first began this venture . But as the trip to Bloomington , Indiana , neared , the pressure built . They received phone calls from well-meaning investors asking how the casting was going or confirming when the shoot date was . They were n't antsy or doubtful that Chase and Keith could bring a return for their investment , but they were curious . <p> The same way everyone surrounding the film was curious . <p> Keith handled these phone calls . He was the calmer of the two , the one whose faith knew no limits . It had been Keith 's decision that they would make the film with money from investors rather than selling out too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects retained complete creative control-and the message of this first film was one Chase and Keith would n't let anyone change . No matter how much easy studio money might hang in the balance . <p> Moments like this Chase worried about all of it . His wife and little girls back home , and whether the production team could stick to the aggressive film schedule they 'd set . Chase massaged his thumb into his brow . The concerns made up a long list . He had to manage a cast of egos that included an academy award winner and two household names-both of whom had reputations for being talented but difficult . He had to keep everyone working well together and stick to his four-week schedule-all while staying on budget . He worried about running out of money or running out of time , and whether this was really where God wanted them-working in a world as crazy as Hollywood . <p> Chase took a long breath and exhaled slowly . The white-haired woman next to him was reading a magazine , but she glanced his way now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't interested . He looked out the window again and a picture filled his mind , the picture of an apartment building surrounded by police tape . The image was from his high school days in the San Fernando Valley , when a major earthquake hit Southern California . The damage was considerable , but the Northridge Meadows apartment symbolized the worst of it . In a matter of seconds , the three-story apartment building collapsed and became one-the weight of the top two floors too great for the shaken foundation . <p> A shudder ran its way through Chase . <p> That could be them in a few months if the filming did n't go well , if the foundation of their budget did n't hold the weight of all that was happening on top of it . Chase could already feel the weight pressing in along his shoulders . <p> " Excuse me . " The woman beside him tapped his arm . " Does your seatback have a copy of the SkyMall magazine ? Mine 's missing . " <p> Chase checked and found what the woman wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Helps pass the time . " <p> " Yes . " She had kind blue eyes . " Especially during takeoff . I can usually find something for my precious little Max . He 's a cockapoo . Cute as a button . " <p> " I 'm sure . " Chase nodded and looked out the window once more . Pressure came with the job , he 'd known that from the beginning . He and Keith were producers ; with that came a certain sense of thrill and awe , terror and anxiety , because for every dollar they 'd raised toward this movie , for every chance an investor took on their film , there was a coinciding possibility that something could go wrong . <p> " You ever wonder , " Chase had asked Keith a few days ago over a Subway sandwich , " whether we should 've just stayed in Indonesia ? " <p> Keith only smiled that slow smile , the one that morphed across his face when his confidence came from someplace otherworldly . " This is where we 're supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waited until he 'd swallowed . He looked deep into Chase 's eyes . " I feel it in the center of my bones . " <p> Truth and integrity . That 's what Keith worried about . The truth of the message when the film was finally wrapped and they brought it to the public , and integrity with the cast and crew , the investors and the studios . For Keith , every day was a test because God was watching . <p> Chase agreed , but the pressure he felt did n't come from being under the watchful eye of the Lord . That mattered a great deal , but God would accept them whether they returned home having completed their movie mission or not . Rather Chase worried because the whole world was watching to see what sort of movie the two of them could make on such a limited budget . And if they failed , the world would know that too . <p> They were in the air now and the woman beside him closed the SkyMall magazine and handed it back to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new for Max . " She shrugged one thin shoulder . " I 've been making this trip a lot lately . Trying to sell my house in Indiana . " <p> Chase still did n't want to talk , but the woman reminded him of his grandmother . She had a warmth about her , and something else ... a sadness maybe . Whatever it was he felt compelled to give her at least a little time . " Moving to San Jose ? " <p> " Yes . It 's time , I guess . " She looked straight ahead at nothing in particular . " Lived in Indiana all my life . " Light from the window fell on her soft wrinkled skin , and for a few seconds her smile faded . She had to be eighty at least , but she seemed a decade younger . Then , as if she suddenly remembered she 'd begun a conversation with a stranger , she grinned at Chase again . " What about you ? Heading home ? " <p> " No . " He angled himself so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bloomington for business . " <p> She looked delighted that he was talking to her . " Business ! " She raised an eyebrow . " My husband was a businessman . What line of work ? " <p> " I 'm a producer . " Chase fought with the sense of privilege and headiness that came with the title . " We 'll be on location four weeks . " <p> " Produce ! Is n't that wonderful . " She folded her hands in her lap . " My great nephew works in produce . Got a job at the grocer not too far from his parents ' house and now he unpacks tomatoes and cabbage all day long . " <p> Chase opened his mouth to tell her he was a producer , and not in produce , but she was n't finished . <p> " He 's only been at it a few months , but I do n't think he 'll end up in produce long term . He wants to finish school . " She angled her head sweetly . " Did you finish college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But- " <p> " Well , of course you did . " She laughed lightly at herself . " You must be a produce manager , heading to the farms of Bloomington for harvest season , making sure the crop 's coming up good and going out to stores across the country . " She gave as hearty a nod as she could muster . " That 's a mighty important job . " Her finger gave a quick jab in his direction . " The public takes it for granted , the way we need produce managers . We walk into a store and just assume we can buy a pound of red apples or Vidalia onions . " She settled back in her seat , but she looked straight at him . " Farming 's the American way . " Her grin held a level of admiration . " Thanks for what you do for this great nation ... what 'd you say your name was ? " <p> " Chase . Chase Ryan . " <p> " Matilda Ewing . Mattie . " <p> " Nice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Ryan , " she held out her bony fingers . " It 's a pleasure to meet you too . But what about your family back home ? Four weeks is an awful long time to be apart . My son nearly lost his marriage once because of that . He was in sales ... had to figure out a different territory to save his family . " She barely paused . " You do have a family , right ? " <p> " Yes , ma'am . It 's hard to be away . " He was touched by the woman 's transparency . " My wife , Kelly , is home with our little girls . They 're four and two . " <p> She sucked in a surprised breath . " And you 'll be gone four weeks ! You must have a peach for a wife . That 's a long time to tend to a family by yourself . " <p> " Yes , ma'am . " Chase wondered if the woman was slightly confused . Seconds ago she was singing his praise , claiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now she was practically chastising him for daring to take such a long trip . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
