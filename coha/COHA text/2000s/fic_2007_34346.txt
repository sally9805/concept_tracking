WHY CHINA ? It was him , no question . The same guy . I spotted him from far away , some angle of his head or chin that made my stomach jump before I even realized who I was looking at . I made my way toward him around the acupuncturists , the herbal doctors slapping mustard-colored poultices on bloody wounds , and the vendors of the platform shoes and polyester bell-bottoms everyone in Kunming was mysteriously wearing . I was afraid he 'd recognize me . Then it hit me that I 'd still been beardless when he 'd ripped me off , two years before , and my beard -- according to old friends , who were uniformly staggered by the sight of me -- had completely transformed ( for the better , I kept waiting to hear ) my appearance . We were the only two Westerners at this outdoor market , which was a long bike ride from my hotel and seedy in a way I could n't pin down . The guy saw me coming . " Howdy , " he said . " Hello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always notice eyes , and his were a funny gray-green -- bright , with long lashes like little kids have . He 'd been wearing a suit when I met him , and a short ponytail , which at that particular moment signified hip Wall Street . One look and you saw the life : Jeep Wrangler , brand-new skis , fledgling art collection that , if he 'd had balls enough to venture beyondFischl and Schnabel and Basquiat , might have included a piece by my wife . He 'd been the sort of New Yorker we San Franciscans are slightly in awe of . Now his hair was short , unevenly cut , and he wore some kind of woven jacket . " You been here long ? " I asked . " Here where ? " " China . " " Eight months , " he said . " I work for the China Times . " I stuffed my hands in my pockets , feeling weirdly self-conscious , like I was the one with something to hide . " You working on something now ? " " Drugs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any over here . " He leaned toward me , half smiling . " You 're standing in the heroin capital of China . " " No shit , " I said . He rolled on the balls of his feet . I knew it was time to bid polite farewell and move on , but I stayed where I was . " You with a tour ? " he finally asked . " Just my wife and kids . We 're trying to get a train to Chengdu , been waiting five days . " " What 's the problem ? " " Mei you , " I said , quoting the ubiquitous Chinese term for " ca n't be done . " But you never know what , or which factors , if changed , would make that " no " a " yes . " " That 's what the hotel people keep saying . " " Fuck the hotel , " he said . We stood a moment in silence , then he checked his watch . " Look , if you want to hang out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets , " he said . He wandered off and said a few words to a lame Chinese albino crouched near a building alongside the market . China Times , I thought . Like hell . Heroin pusher was more like it . At the same time , there was an undeniable thrill in being near this guy . He was a crook -- I knew it , but he had no idea I knew . I enjoyed having this over him ; it almost made up for the twenty-five grand he 'd conned out of me . We set off on our bicycles back toward the center of town . With Caroline and the girls I took taxis , which could mean anything from an automobile to a cart pulled by some thin , sweating guy on a bicycle . It pissed me off that the four of us could n't ride bikes together like any other Chinese family . ( " Since when are we a Chinese family , Sam ? " was my wife 's reply . ) But the girls pleaded terror of falling off the bikes and getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ringing their tinny , useless bells . Secretly , I believed that what really turned my daughters off were the crummy black bikes the Chinese rode -- such a far cry from the shiny five-and ten-speeds Melissa and Kylie had been reared on . In our previous encounter , his name had been Cameron Pierce . Now , as we rode , he introduced himself as Stuart Peale , shouting over the thunderous racket of passing trucks . The names fit him exactly , both times ; Cameron had had the impatient , visionary air of a guy who thinks he can make you a shitload of money ; Stuart was soft-spoken , a sharp observer -- what you 'd expect from a reporter . I told him my name -- Sam Lafferty -- half hoping he 'd make the connection , but only when I named the company I traded for did I notice him pause for a second . " I 've taken a leave while they investigate me , " I said , to my own astonishment . " Investigate you for what ? " " Messing with the numbers . " And unnerved though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mad urge to continue . " It 's just internal at this point . " " Wow , " he said , giving me an odd look . " Good luck . " We dismounted in front of a large concrete kiosk teeming with several lines of people all shoving and elbowing one another goodnaturedly toward a ticket counter in a manner I 'd decided was uniquely Chinese . Stuart spoke to a uniformed official in vehement but ( I sensed ) broken Chinese , gesturing at me . At last the official led us grudgingly through a side door and down a dimly lit corridor that had the smudged , institutional feel of the public schools I 'd attended as a kid and made sure my daughters would never go near . " Where is it you 're headed -- Chengdu ? " he called . We had entered a shabby office where a military-looking woman sat behind a desk , seeming thoroughly disgruntled at Stuart 's intrusion . " Yes -- for four people , " I reminded him . Within minutes , I 'd handed Stuart a wad of cash and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tepid , dusty sunlight . " You leave tomorrow , " he said . " Eight-thirty A.M. They 'd only sell me first class -- hope that 's okay . " " It 's fine . " We always rode first class . So had Stuart , I guessed , in his prior incarnation . " Thank you , " I said . " Jesus . " He waved it away . " They do n't want Americans having a lousy time over here , " he said . " You point out that it 's happening , they 'll fix it . " He handed me his card , the address in English and Chinese , the China Times logo neatly embossed . Still a pro , I thought . " You live in Xi'an , " I remarked . " We may go there , check out that clay army . " Look me up , " he said , clearly not meaning it . " Thanks again . " " Forget it , " he said , then mounted his bicycle and rode away . " A total stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , where I 'd surprised her with the train tickets . " He just did this , for no reason ? " " He was American . " I was dying to tell her he was the cocksucker who 'd conned me , but how could I explain having hung out with the guy , having accepted a favor from him ? I knew how Caroline would see it : one more incident in the string of odd things I 'd been doing since the investigation began , the most recent of which was to beg my family to drop everything and come with me to China . It was n't depression , exactly ; more a weird , restless pressure that made me wander the house late at night , opening the best bottles of wine in our cellar and drinking them alone while I channel-surfed along the forgotten byways of cable TV . " Where are the girls ? " I said . " I got them each a little knife to peel pears with . " " You bought them knives ? " " Just little ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old ladies are always peeling pears ? I 've got a feeling there 's something on those skins they should n't be eating . " Caroline had washed her bras and underpants and was hanging them on the open dresser drawers to dry . In the late seventies , before we married , we 'd spent a year in Kenya with the Peace Corps . Caroline washed her clothes the same way over there , hanging them on strings she tied across our tiny room . I used to watch her through the web of strings and underclothes -- her reddish brown hair and deep , peaceful eyes that made me think of amber . I always liked remembering that time , knowing the money and houses and trips we 'd gotten our hands on since had n't washed it all away . We 're still those people , I 'd tell myself , who helped the Masai to repair their houses made of cow dung . Caroline opened a window , and instantly the sour , bodily smell of China poured into the room . " A perfect stranger , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been that sweet face of yours . " My daughters give me away . They are blond , expensive-looking creatures whose soft skin and upturned noses I used to take credit -- wrongly , I know -- for having procured for them at great cost , as I had their orthodontically perfect smiles . In Kenya the Masai children had dry lips and flies in their eyes . Memories of their deprivation had overwhelmed me in recent months , for reasons unknown . l 'd find myself staring at my daughters accusingly , awaiting some acknowledgment from them of the brutal disparity between the Masai kids ' lives and their own . Instead , I found in their beauty a righteousness that galled me . The Avenging Angels , I 'd started calling them , which perplexed my wife . Not that my daughters were identical . They were ten and twelve years old , the younger one deeply in awe of the elder , Melissa , whose figure-skating prowess had lent her a kind of celebrity at their private grammar school . Melissa was also , the world seemed to agree , fractionally more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately become the fervid champion of Kylie , my youngest , a campaign my wife deplored and begged me to abandon . " Picking favorites is awful , Sam , " she told me . " Melissa thinks you hate her . " " The world picked . I 'm just evening up the balance . " But there was something heavy-handed in the sudden barrage of affection I lavished on Kylie . She rose to the occasion , gamely enduring our " special " trips to the zoo and the Exploratorium and Ocean Beach , where we stumped through the damp , heavy sand , both wishing ( or I was , at least ) that Melissa -- whom I 'd bluntly excluded , whose skating competitions I often pretended to doze through -- were with us . But now their hatred of China , their deep resentment at having to spend the best part of their summer in a land where people blew their noses without Kleenex , had united Melissa and Kylie in steely mutiny against me . " Daddy , why ? " had been their refrain from the moment the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the days of waiting for a plane to Kunming that , when it finally arrived , could not have inspired less confidence had we assembled it ourselves . " Why , Daddy ? " With time the object of their query had grown more and more diffuse : Why here ? Why any of this ? They were asking the wrong man . The buildings of Chengdu were newer , and therefore less pleasing , than those of Kunming . I roamed the streets impatiently , my wife and listless daughters in tow . We drank green tea in a moist enclave beside a Buddhist temple . The fog smelled of chemicals . An Asian girl with strange pale-blue eyes kept staring at us . " Do you think she might be crazy , Dad ? " Melissa asked . " She 's admiring your haircut . " Melissa glanced at me , thinking I might be serious , then recognized the acid sarcasm that had become my preferred mode of speech with her of late . " Probably had you for a dad , " she muttered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She 's blind , " she said . And instantly I saw that Caroline was right ; the girl was drawn by our unrecognizable voices , but her eyes were empty . " Let 's go to Xi'an , " I said . " It 's supposed to be fascinating . " Melissa opened our guidebook , scanned the pages , and read aloud : " The Qin Terra-Cotta Warriors are one of the few reasons to visit Xi'an , an urban wasteland of uniform city blocks and Soviet style apartment buildings , but they are a compelling one . " That 's not what I heard , " I said , suppressing an urge to knock the book out of her hands . " Terra-cotta worriers ? " Kylie said . " Heard from who ? " my wife asked . " The guy who got us the train tickets . " " They 're thousands of clay soldiers as big as real men , " Caroline explained to Kylie . " A paranoid Chinese emperor had them built underground to protect him after he died . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Let 's go there . " " Why ? " Melissa asked , but no one answered . Looking downtrodden , Melissa wandered out first from the tea shop . As we followed her , I turned to glance behind me , and sure enough , the Asian girl with the pale-blue eyes was still gazing blindly after us . I knew -- and Caroline knew -- that since the investigation began , my status had slipped -- or risen -- from that of her husband and equal to that of a person she indulged . Gratitude and guilt played a part in this . I 'd worked my ass off at the office for years while she puttered away in her sculpture studio . Then , three years ago , Caroline hit the jackpot , landing a piece in the Whitney Biennial . This led to more exhibits , one-person shows in several cities , including New York , and dozens of studio visits from thin , beautiful women and their sleek young husbands who smelled ( like me , I suppose ) of fresh cash , or from scrawny , perfumed old bats whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything my wife had yet to sculpt for the next three years was already sold . We 'd talked about my quitting , pursuing anthropology or social work like I 'd always said I wanted to , or just relaxing , for Christ 's sake . But our overhead was so high : the house in Presidio Terrace , the girls in private school heading toward college , skating lessons , riding lessons , piano lessons , tennis camp in the summers -- I wanted them to have all of it , all of it and more , for the rest of their lives . Even Caroline 's respectable income could not have begun to sustain it . Then let 's change , she 'd said . Let 's scale back . But the idea filled me with dread ; I was n't a sculptor , I was n't a painter , I was n't a person who made things . What I 'd busted my chops all these years to create was precisely the life we led now . If we tossed that away , what would have been the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out about the investigation . Its architect , the aptly named Jeffrey Fox , had been after my scalp for years because his wife , Sheila , was a ball-buster , whereas mine was lovely and terrific . He was always sniffing around Caroline 's studio , and had bought three of her pieces the year before . " That little turd ! " Caroline had shrieked when I told her about the investigation , and night after night we 'd sat awake long after the girls were in bed , holding whispered conferences on how I should respond : Write a letter to the board proclaiming my innocence ? Mount a counteroffensive against Fox ? But no , we decided . The best thing to do , for the moment , was nothing . Let the investigation run its course , and when it turned up nada , question the legitimacy of its having been started at all . In the meantime , take a leave , clear my head , get some sleep . Ha-ha
