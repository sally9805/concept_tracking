Kendall Adams sat across from her father in the executive boardroom of his Los Angeles high-rise and stared at the rolling hills of Hollywood in the distance . October was always like this-brilliant blue skies and air as clear as a summer day in Montana . Kendall breathed deep , stood , and sauntered to the window . <p> " I 'm still amazed- " She glanced over her shoulder at her dad . " - that you 're doing this . " <p> " It 's my passion too . " Her father smiled , and the warmth in his eyes belied his cunning business sense and high-profile **25;0;TOOLONG status . " I 've been looking for an investment opportunity like this for years . " <p> Kendall looked down from twenty-three stories at a busy Melrose Boulevard . What would this venture bring , this decision to team up with Chase Ryan and Keith Ellison ? Was filmmaking where she would find healing for her broken heart ? <p> She watched a breeze dance through the palm trees that framed the constant traffic below . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on his feet , coming toward her . " I can feel it . " <p> " No . " She linked her arm through his as he came up alongside her . " About the movies . And whether or not this is when life finds its way back to normal again . " <p> A tight-lipped sigh hung briefly on her dad 's lips . " I wish I never would 've introduced you to that ... that - " <p> " It 's over . " Her calm voice reflected none of the pain that still colored the edges of every moment . " I do n't blame you or me . Or God . It 's time for whatever 's next . " <p> A comfortable silence fell around them , tempered only by the distant sounds of telephones and office staff on the other side of the door . <p> " Will you tell them ? The producers ? " <p> " No . " She did n't hesitate . " What happened was private . The media never really figured out the story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadowed her father 's expression . " Good call . You 'll spend a lot of time with Chase and Keith , but it 's better to ... well , you know , keep things on a business level . " <p> Kendall studied her dad for a long moment . Times like this she still wondered if he merely offered fatherly advice or worried about saving face , about making sure no one knew how much she 'd lost over the last year . How much they 'd both lost . <p> A shiver ran down her spine . Maybe if she pretended it never happened , a time would come when she might go a whole day without feeling the pain . <p> The phone rang from the middle of the long table and her dad answered it . " Yes , fine . We 're ready for them . " He hung up and reached back to give her a hug . " It 's a new day , Kendall . God 's going to use this partnership . I have a great feeling about it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set aside the memories of the past . Her dad was right . This was a new time for both of them . <p> She smoothed her blouse and stayed at her father 's elbow as he moved to the door . His secretary knocked at about the same time and ushered in Chase and Keith . This was the first time the four of them had been together since the wrap party in Bloomington , Indiana , for The Last Letter , so the greetings between them took a little longer than usual . <p> As soon as they were seated at the table , Chase leaned back and gripped the armrests . " Keith and I truly appreciate you taking the time to meet with us . " He looked at his friend and then back to Kendall and her father . " But with the economy the way it is , we do n't want you to feel obligated to give us additional financial help . We wanted to get that out at the beginning . " <p> Kendall felt like rushing around the table and giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attitude was in Hollywood ? The idea of looking out for someone else first ? <p> She shared a smile with her dad and the look in his eyes told her to take the lead . She sat up a little straighter . " Actually , we 're more committed to your movies now than ever . " <p> " That 's right . Kendall has great news about your next film-the one we talked about last time we were together . " Her father looked elated . He had said once that his fortune brought him no joy whatsoever except when it could be used to share God 's truth and light , and when it could help make other people 's dreams come true . " And I 'm certain you 're needing more funds for the editing process , is that right ? " <p> " Actually , we 're okay . " Keith opened a file he 'd brought with him and handed copies of an accounting sheet to Kendall and her father . " The funds you provided at the end of the shoot have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editing process okay . It 's what happens after that . " <p> " Publicity and advertising-or the P&amp;A budget , as they call it . " Kendall 's father grinned . " Not a problem , guys . Count me in . We want this movie on the big screens . " <p> Chase looked a little dizzy , and again something about him touched Kendall 's heart . He was sincere and kind , genuine in his desire to make movies for the purpose of reaching people . With everything in her she hoped the movie business never changed him . <p> Once they moved past the initial budget issues for The Last Letter , Kendall took over . " The author of Unlocked is still very interested in giving you both the option for her book . It 's been on the New York Times Best-Sellers List for ten weeks now . " <p> " We know . " Keith allowed the hint of a smile . " We figured she must 've had a hundred offers by now . " <p> " She has . " Kendall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she loved this-watching the impossible become a reality for a couple of good guys like Keith and Chase . " But she wants to work with you . " She pulled a notepad from her bag and checked the details . " Stephanie 's on deadline for her next novel . She 'll be busy the next month or so . Then she 'd like to fly here and meet you . Get the option in ink . " She looked up . " That should give you enough time to finish editing The Last Letter and submit the film to the festivals . Which I 'd like to help with , by the way . " <p> She could see Chase wrestling with a question . After a few seconds he lost the battle . " Brandon Paul ? Is that still an option for Unlocked ? " <p> Kendall laughed-the happy lighthearted laughter that had once marked her world . " He 's more than an option . I talked to him yesterday . He 's in . We only have to work out the details with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She grinned at the men around her . " Monumental details like that . " <p> Both Keith and Chase hesitated , but seeing Kendall and her father 's confidence , they both chuckled and the mood relaxed . They spent the next few moments talking about their families , their wives and kids . Keith was worried about his college-aged daughter , Andi , away at school in Bloomington , and Chase was concerned his wife might get tired of running things back in San Jose . But for the most part , life was good for the producers , and Kendall was glad . They would need to be strong . If their experience was like hers , Hollywood life would test them sorely . <p> The meeting lasted another thirty minutes while they worked out specific details of the financing and repayment plan for The Last Letter . They discussed how Kendall would look for additional investors for Unlocked as well . The budget would be considerably higher because of Brandon Paul , but because of her father Kendall was very connected with Hollywood 's wealthy elite-people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd find someone . <p> When the guys left , everyone shared hugs . Kendall hugged Chase last , and not until she was in his arms did she realize with great alarm something that had n't occurred to her before . <p> Chase 's athletic build was the same as that of Kendall 's ex-husband . <p> She drew back quickly , though not quickly enough to let on what she felt . Heat rushed to her cheeks , and she hurried through one last round of good-byes . <p> Even before the producers reached the end of the hall , Kendall 's father kissed her cheek . " I have to check on another meeting down the hall . Will you be here ? " <p> " No . " She still felt flustered , dizzy almost . " I ... I have an appointment in Laguna Beach with an investor . " <p> She bid him good-bye and walked to the elevator , grateful no one else found their way into her car as she made her way down . Why had n't she seen it before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> She hurried through the lobby and into the parking structure , and when she was alone in her car she leaned back against the headrest and closed her eyes . God ... let me get past this . Please . She longed for a response . But there was none . And like that , the past played out again in her mind . <p> The car accident had been horrific , one of the worst in recent history . It had nearly killed Jay , and the details that followed had nearly killed Kendall . Jay had been driving Kendall 's car . The head-on crash had taken place in a handful of seconds , long enough for a drunk driver in a work truck to cross the double yellow lines on Mulholland Drive and barrel head on into a speeding Jay . The mangled metal heaps that remained once the dust settled made it hard for rescue workers to know exactly how many victims they were working with . <p> At first media reports had it that Kendall had been killed in the wreck . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frantic text messages began popping up on her phone . <p> Are you alive ? <p> Are you okay ? <p> Thank God Jay 's alive ! <p> And dozens of promises to pray . She took a flight back that afternoon , and by the time her plane touched down everyone knew the truth . <p> The dead body in the passenger seat of Kendall 's BMW was not Kendall , but rather the twenty-two-year-old model Jay had been secretly seeing . At almost the same time , another significant piece of information rose to the surface : the young woman had been eight months pregnant with Jay 's son . <p> The story hit the news , of course , but to this day Kendall was grateful it had n't blown up across the front pages . The media never made much of the fact that Jay was Ben Adams ' son-in-law , and since the accident was n't only Jay 's fault , the media lost interest . The same could n't be said for the lawyers in the case . <p> The parents of the dead pregnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The victim had been the single mother of two little girls-neither fathered by Jay . But since the drunk driver had no insurance , and since Jay was cited with reckless driving for speeds in excess of eighty miles per hour , the lawyers came after Kendall 's father-the registered owner of the BMW . <p> In court the truth about the woman came out . She had been a terrible mother , rarely visiting her children and leaving her own mother to raise them . At the time of the accident , the model had n't spoken with her mother or her daughters for more than a year . Still , her mother contended that she could continue to raise her granddaughters , but she would need a great deal of money to pull it off . By the time the haggling and courtroom drama ended , the settlement for the woman 's daughters had cost Kendall 's father just under a million dollars . <p> The accident cost Kendall a lot more than that . <p> She talked to Jay just once afterwards , late at night during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooked to an IV , his legs in a pair of casts , bandages around his head . Even with that , he was watching TV as if he had n't just been party to a fatal accident , as if his whole world had n't fallen apart . She stood in the hospital doorway staring at him , seeing him the way he 'd looked five years earlier , the night they met . <p> He must 've heard her , because he turned his head , and when he saw her , his face fell . For a long while he held her gaze , then he turned off the TV and looked away . " I 'm surprised you came . " <p> " Me too . " She moved slowly into his room , clutching her purse in front of her , as if keeping something between them might protect her heart from further damage . She reached the side of his bed and waited . Just waited , because she figured it was n't her job to do the talking . <p> The silence quickly became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes found hers again . " I was going to tell you . " He brought his hand slowly to his face and pressed his fingers against his brow . " I just ... I had n't figured out how . " <p> Kendall could voice just one question . " Did you ... love her ? " <p> He closed his eyes for a long time . When he opened them again he said something that had stayed with her ever since . " Everybody loves everybody in this business . " His lips were dry and cracked . He ran his tongue over them , buying time . " It was my fault . I let it get out of hand . " <p> " Out of hand ? " She wanted to scream at him . His girlfriend had been about to deliver his baby . The baby Kendall had n't been able to give him . " Were you planning to marry her ? " <p> Again he hesitated . Then , " It does n't matter . " <p> Kendall thought of a dozen more questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end she said nothing . The silence between them deafened her , the whir of machines and the sickly , antiseptic hospital smell filling her senses . <p> Finally he spoke . " My attorney is drawing up the papers . The divorce will be final before summer 's over . " <p> And like that , five years were finished . <p> The trouble was Kendall had n't seen it coming . In the days since the accident she had relived every wonderful day of their relationship a thousand times . In all her life she 'd never met anyone like Jay Randolph . He had a faith that made him larger than life , and a charisma that made him the center of attention wherever he went . Her father introduced them at an Academy Awards after-party . Kendall liked to say he swept her off her feet and stole her heart all in a single conversation . <p> Kendall credited the Lord with a pair of miracles in the months since that final meeting with Jay . First , she had survived with a determination to live-to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help filmmakers like Keith and Chase make an impact in the entertainment industry . <p> The second miracle was this : her love for God lived still . She 'd been tempted at first to walk away from her faith . That 's what Jay had done . In Hollywood , Jay 's beliefs had crumbled and fallen away until they were nothing more than a patch on his sleeve . They had n't stopped him from having an affair , so why should Kendall think her faith could help her ? <p> But that attitude had lasted only a few weeks before she literally felt herself wasting away inside . <p> Kendall grabbed a long breath and opened her eyes . The faith she 'd seen in the eyes of Chase and Keith was real , genuine , and that was Kendall 's greatest concern . She could n't stand to see the movie business do to them what it had done to Jay . That 's why she 'd felt so alarmed by the strange feelings she 'd had when she hugged Chase . She could never , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them needed to stick together , talk about their faith and their commitments , include God every step of the way . <p> Kendall 's resolve grew as she started her car and pulled out of the parking complex . If they did n't keep God at the center of everything they did , the power of their films would n't really matter . Because the next moral failure to hit Hollywood could be one of theirs . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
