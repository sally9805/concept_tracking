HOW IT STARTED Soldiers transformed battlefield objects into objets d'art ; thanks to the Internet , they 're being traded <P> JUDGMENT CALL It 's beautiful , bizarre , and can be worth a bomb <P> Californian Jane Kimball never planned to write a book or start a website . But one $15 engraved brass vase inspired a collection of more than 700 pieces and the pursuit of the stories behind them . The vase  --  originally a 1915 German artillery shell  --  is an example of trench art , mostly produced in World War I but still being made in Kosovo today . It has recently taken off as a hot commodity and subject of scholarship : the first book on trench art was published in April by Nicholas Saunders of University College London , and an exhibition opened in May in France . Three exhibitions are planned for the U.S. , and prices are climbing on eBay : shell casings are going for as much as $1,000 . Why now ? Saunders is n't sure , but he advises anyone with trench art to dig up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of objects . It cuts across social , cultural , military and art history .
