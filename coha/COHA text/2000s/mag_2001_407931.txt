<p> You want to come back from your vacation feeling rested-not stressed , sick , or injured . Our guide offers you 40+ tips for having a healthy good time . Do n't leave home without it <p> When you 're leaving for vacation , the last thing on your mind is your health . After checking and rechecking lists , packing enough stuff to supply a small army , and making arrangements for someone to feed your goldfish , you 're probably too exhausted to think about ways to stay healthy away from home . <p> But after investing so much time and energy ( not to mention money ! ) in your trip , you do n't want it ruined by cramps , kinks , rashes , sunburn , injury , or assorted bumps , breaks , bugs , bacteria , or viruses . And you do n't want to come back with more " baggage " ( read : pounds ) than you had when you left . <p> Not to worry . Our guide to healthy travel will tell you how to eat well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no matter where you 're headed or how you plan to get there . Plane Truth Get there fast-and safely <p> Flying is fast and convenient , but as any frequent flier knows , air travel comes with its own set of aggravations . To make your flight more enjoyable , try these : Distribute your luggage among two smaller suitcases instead of one large one , says Edward N. Hanley Jr. , MD , chairman of the department of orthopedic surgery at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte , NC . This will help you balance the weight while carrying your bags through the airport . Better yet , wheel your luggage . Check all bags that are heavier than 5 to 10% of your body weight . When stowing your carry-on luggage , stand straight and away from the overhead compartment , suggests the American Chiropractic Association . Whenever possible , place heavier bags under the seat in front of you to avoid having to lift them over your head . Before you buckle up , place a small airplane pillow or an inflatable lumbar support in the gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counteract the tendency to slump and decrease the risk of in-flight back pain . Do n't cross your legs . It shortens the leg muscles , reduces circulation , and creates an uneven weight on the hips and pelvis , which can cause lower-back pain . Rest your feet on a briefcase or carry-on bag on the floor . This will bring your knees above your hips to take the pressure off your lower back . Get up , and move around . Studies show that sitting motionless for several hours-whether in a plane or a car-increases your risk of developing deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) , a condition in which blood clots form in your legs . In rare instances , the clots can be fatal . <p> To minimize the risk of developing DVT , walk ( or at least stand ) once every 2 hours . At your seat , point your toes down ( heels up ) , then raise your toes up toward your knees so that you 're flexing your calf muscles , suggests Rebecca W. Acosta , MPH , executive director of Traveler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standing upright will also reduce strain on your lower back . Say no to the greasy muffin or mystery meat enchilada . Instead , pack fruit , a whole wheat bagel , or other healthy treats . Or buy some fruit and yogurt or a smoothie at the airport before you board the plane . That way , you 're covered if you do n't like what they 're serving . Request a low-fat meal when you book your tickets , suggests Elizabeth Somer , RD , author of The Origin Diet ( Henry Holt , 2001 ) . Or you can call ahead . Most airlines request at least 24-hour notice for special meals , which range from vegetarian , kosher , and diabetic to gluten-free , lactose-free , and more . Wear loose-fitting clothing , and pack a pair of slippers or thick socks in your carry-on bag for your feet , says Acosta . For longer flights , bring along an inflatable pillow for your neck in case you plan to nap . It folds flat and packs easily in your carry-on bag . Bring a liter bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours or more , says Acosta . It takes a lot of water to stay hydrated on a plane , where the air is very dry . Alcohol only makes you more dehydrated , so steer clear of the cocktail cart . Dehydration causes headaches and makes the symptoms of jet lag worse . Drinking lots of water has an added benefit : It forces you to get up and use the bathroom , which keeps you-and your blood-moving . Flying across time zones ? Do n't let jet lag ruin your vacation , says Acosta , who recommends a few commonsense tips : If you 're flying at night , ignore the overhead movies , and get some shut-eye if you can . Ask your doctor about a mild sleep aid , especially if you 're on a long flight of 8 hours or more , she suggests . ( One downside is that this can make you too groggy to deal with delays and emergencies . ) Upon arrival , spend as much time outdoors as possible during the daylight hours ; this helps in the adjustment process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) if you 're feeling sleep deprived . Car Talk How to survive the drive <p> There are two kinds of people in this world : those who think driving across five states is a great way to see the world , and those who would rather have a tooth extracted without novocaine than endure long hours of bad radio , cramped space , and the world 's worst food options . We ca n't help you with the radio , but we can tell you how to eat better and feel more comfortable on long car rides . <p> Whether you 're traveling by turnpike or freeway , unhealthy food awaits you at every exit and rest stop . " Yet if you eat healthfully on the road , then a lot of other things that go along with travel , such as stress , fatigue , and poor sleep , can be prevented , " says Somer . " By fueling your body with healthy foods , you 'll have more energy and be more alert . You may even sleep better if you 're not drinking coffee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if you 're careful about how long you drive and your driving posture , you 'll arrive at your destination without feeling like you 've been packed into your own luggage . Here 's what to do : Pack an ice chest with small , nutritious snacks such as baby carrots , fruit , peanut butter on whole wheat bread , and yogurt . Throw in some bottled water , orange juice , or 1% milk . If fast food is your only option , stay away from fried items and fatty accompaniments such as mayo and oily dressings . Grilled chicken sandwiches are okay if you tell them to hold the mayo . Ordering a salad ? Go easy on the dressing , or order a light dressing . If you 're leaving in the morning , pack your car the night before . Fluids pool in your spinal disks while you sleep , making your lower back taut and sensitive to irritation when you first wake up . Before getting into the car , take a short walk to loosen your leg muscles , and be sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be treated like an athletic event . To minimize driver fatigue , stop every 2 to 3 hours ( make it every 2 hours if you 're traveling with children ) to stretch and walk around , advises Acosta . Use a back support . The widest part of the lumbar support pillow should be between the bottom of your rib cage and your waist . You can find a wide variety of back supports designed for car use in stores and online . Tilt your rearview mirror up a little bit . This will help your posture by making you sit up straighter to see out the back window . You should still be able to see clearly out the back . Room Service Rules for your home away from home <p> By the time you reach your hotel or motel , you might be feeling a little stressed or run-down . That 's not good for your health : Stress suppresses the immune system , making you more vulnerable to the germs you encounter along the way . <p> Vacation is about relaxing , and you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full-blown cold . Yet that 's what often happens to travel-weary vacationers , says Douglas Schar , DipPhyt , MCPP , MNIMH , a clinical herbalist based in Washington , DC . Here 's how to protect yourself from illness , get a good night 's sleep , and get out of the hotel without spending more on the fat-filled goodies in the honor snack bar than you do for the room : Take echinacea , says Schar . Echinacea is an herb that boosts the immune system by stimulating the production of infection-fighting white blood cells . Start taking it 5 days before you leave for vacation , and continue for 5 days after your return . Dosage : 1 teaspoon of 1:5 tincture three times daily , or one 500-mg tablet three times daily . Pack chamomile tea bags . Chamomile can help take the edge off a stressful journey by relaxing a tense mind and sore muscles , according to Schar . It also has a sedative effect , so you 'll be able to get a good night 's sleep . Bring your own pillow or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds . That little touch of home can help . Be safe : Upon arrival , inquire about fire exits , alarms , and sprinkler systems , says Acosta . Always lock your door , and avoid first-floor rooms , which are too easily accessible from outdoors . It 's tempting , but do n't open that refrigerator in your room , advises Somer . It 's filled with fatty , overpriced snacks . Instead , cover it with a towel , and take a walk to a nearby grocery store to stock up on fruit , baked tortilla chips and salsa , and other healthy treats . Be picky with the room service menu . " Do n't assume that what 's on the menu is all that you can have , " says frequent traveler Somer . Hold the fluffy white roll , and ask for a big plate of steamed vegetables to accompany grilled chicken or fish . Order just enough to be comfortably full , not stuffed . Stay fit . Most hotels and many motels now have fitness facilities , including swimming pools . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel gym , get out and try something new .

Cruise Control Ship out in good shape <p> Sunshine , good food , nightly entertainment , and stops in colorful ports along the way : It 's not hard to figure out why cruises are so popular . But before you set sail , take along a few simple strategies for staying well on the high seas . Cruise ships are basically floating buffets . If you must sample every calorie-rich food on the table , try filling your plate first with steamed vegetables and a salad . Then take one or two bite-size portions of the creamy/ buttery/fried stuff . Take ginger for motion sickness . Research has shown that ginger beats dimenhydrinate , the main ingredient in many motion sickness drugs such as Dramamine . Dosage : two 500-mg tablets three times daily , or 1 teaspoon of 1:5 tincture three times daily . Protect winter-white skin with sunscreen ( SPF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunlight between 10 am and 4 pm , when the sun 's rays are strongest . " Too often , vacationers will get on a cruise ship headed for the Caribbean , sunbathe for 8 hours on the first day with little or no sunscreen , and end up with a severe burn , " says Grant Tarling , MD , senior ship 's doctor for the Los Angeles- based Princess Cruises . Look into your medical insurance plan before you leave home . If your plan covers you outside the US ( many , including Medicare , do n't ) , carry a copy of your policy and your insurer 's phone number . Otherwise , consider purchasing some additional travel medical insurance , Dr. Tarling says . This applies to any form of travel outside the US and , sometimes , even out of state . In Case of Emergency <p> Whether you 're exploring the Grand Canyon , lounging by Lake Michigan , or parasailing in Cancun , do n't leave home without a well-stocked medicine kit , advises Mary D. Nettleman , MD , an infectious disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richmond . Here 's her list of must-haves : <p> Prescription medications . Keep them in your carry-on luggage , and always bring more than you need . Leave all medicine , both prescription and over-the-counter ( OTC ) , in the original container . This is especially important if you 'll be passing through a customs checkpoint . <p> Cold remedies . Do n't forget cough drops and tissues . <p> Insect repellents . If you 'll be traveling to a country where malaria is a risk , pick one that contains DEET , and consider insecticide room sprays and mosquito nets . <p> Sunscreen and lip balm . Choose SPF 15 or higher . You may also want to include topical cortisone cream for rashes and bites and body lotion containing aloe to soothe burns . <p> Foot care products . Include Band-Aids and pads to protect blistered feet from further damage . <p> For women only , sanitary napkins/tampons . If you 're traveling abroad , include medication for vaginal yeast infections . <p> Diarrhea remedies .

These include aspirin , acetaminophen , or other OTC pain relievers , bandages , gauze , adhesive tape , tweezers , scissors , laxative , and a thermometer .
