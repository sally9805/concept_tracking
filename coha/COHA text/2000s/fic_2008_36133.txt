Nineteen years later Hong Kong <p> " Good girl-such a good girl , " Ellis said , down on one knee as his dog snatched the beef treat from his open palm . With a bite and a gulp , the treat was gone , and Ellis Belasco , with his sleek copper red hair , smiled proudly and added a strong authoritative pat to the back of his smoky brown pet 's neck . As the trainer said , attack dogs had to be rewarded . <p> " P- Please ... my leg ... he chewed my leg ! " the thin Chinese man whined as he crawled across the worn beige carpet toward the hotel room door . <p> " To be clear , she chewed your Achilles ' tendon , " Ellis said , calmly standing up and brushing back his long European-style haircut he was always meticulous to reveal amber eyes framed by striking , lush eyebrows that almost merged on the bridge of his nose . Because of his rosy coloring , his cheeks were always flushed , as were his full lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small tattoo between his thumb and pointer finger . <p> His birthright was healing nicely . <p> For the past two months , Ellis had been tracking the ancient book from collector to collector-from the doctor in China whose death gave it away , to Zhao , the shipper , who schemed to deliver it elsewhere . Every culture called it by a different name , but Ellis knew the truth . <p> " I know you have it , " Ellis said . " I 'd like the Book of Lies now . " <p> From the corner of the bed , Ellis reached for his small gray pistol . <p> " Nonono ... you can't- My fiancTe-We just got engaged ! " the young dockworker begged , scrambling on his one good knee as his other leg left a smear of blood across the carpet . <p> Ellis pressed the barrel of his gun against the man 's throat . It was vital he hit the jugular . But he knew he would . That was the advantage of having God on your side . " I paid what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But it makes me sad that someone else clearly paid you more . " <p> " I swear-the book- I told you where it 's going ! " Zhao screamed , his eyes rolling toward the pistol as Ellis glanced out the hotel window , into the dim alley . The view was awful- " nothing more than a blank brick wall . But that was why Ellis had Zhao meet him here . No view , no witnesses . <p> With a squeeze , Ellis shot him in the throat . <p> There was no bang , just a pneumatic hiss . Zhao jerked slightly , and his eyes blinked open .... " Ai ! Ai , that ! What was that ? " he stuttered as a drop of blood bubbled from his neck . <p> The military called them " jet injectors . " Since World War I , they had been used to vaccinate soldiers quickly and easily . There was no needle . The burst of air was so strong , it drilled through the skin with nothing more than a disposable air cartridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thimble with a tiny hole . All you 'd feel was the snap of a rubber band , and the vaccine was in your blood . For Ellis , it was a bit overdramatic , but if he was to find the Book that had been taken from him ... that had been taken from his family ... He knew every war had rules . His great- grandfather left him this gun-or the plans for this gun , at least-for a reason . It took time and patience to build it from scratch . Ellis had plenty of both . <p> " Forty ... thirty- nine ... thirty- eight ... " Ellis began to count , peeking under the wrist of his starched shirt and checking his new Ulysse Nardin watch . <p> " Wait ... ! The shot- ! What 'd you put in me ! ? " Zhao screamed , gripping the side of his neck . <p> " ... thirty- seven ... thirty-six ... thirty-five ... " Ellis said , his voice as serene as ever . " My family first encountered it in Belgium . Conium maculatum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put hemlock- ! ? You put a poison-are you a fool ! ? Now you get nothing ! " Zhao yelled , fighting hard as he thrashed and crawled toward the door . <p> In a way , Zhao was right . Shooting him was a gamble . But Ellis knew ... it 's not a gamble when you know you 'll win . After unscrewing the empty hemlock vial , he replaced it with a vial filled with a cloudy yellow liquid . <p> " I- Is that the antidote ? " Zhao asked . " It is , is n't it ! ? " <p> Ellis stepped back , away from his victim 's reach . " Do you know who Mitchell Siegel is , Zhao ? " <p> " Wh- What 're you talking about ? " <p> " Thirty- one ... thirty ... twenty- nine ... In 1932 , a man named Mitchell Siegel was shot in the chest and killed . While mourning the death of his father , his young son Jerry came up with the idea of a bulletproof man that he nicknamed Superman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving . " M- My ! Wh- What 'd you do to my legs ! ? " <p> Ellis nodded and stood still . To this day , scientists did n't know why hemlock poisoning started in the feet and worked up from there . <p> " Such a dumb idea , right , Zhao-a bulletproof man ? But the only reason Superman was born was because a little boy missed his father , " Ellis pointed out . " And the best part ? The murder 's still unsolved . In fact , people are still so excited by Superman , they never stop to ask just why Mitchell Siegel was killed-or to even consider that maybe , just maybe , he might 've done something that made him the bad guy in this story .... Twenty ... nineteen ... eighteen ... " <p> " I ca n't feel my legs ! " Zhao sobbed as tears ran down his face . <p> " You think I 'm the bad guy here , but I 'm not , " Ellis said , putting away the empty vial , zipping his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the bed . " I 'm the hero , Zhao . You 're the bad guy . You 're the one keeping the Book of Lies from us . Just like Mitchell Siegel kept it from us . " <p> " P-Please , I do n't know who the hell you 're talking about ! " <p> Ellis crouched down next to Zhao , who was flat on his belly , barely able to catch his breath . " I want my Book . Tell me its final destination . " <p> " I-I-I told you , " Zhao stuttered . " W-We-It 's going to Panama . " <p> " And then where ? " <p> " That 's it- Panama ... " he repeated , his nose pressed to the carpet , his eyes clenched in pain . " Just ... the antidote ... " <p> " You feel that tightening in your waist ? " Ellis asked , looking down and realizing that his shoes could use a new shine . " Your thighs are dead , Zhao . Then it 'll climb to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his entire death-how it slithered from his waist , to his chest , right up to when his eyes were fixed and dilated . " <p> " Okay ... okayokayokay ... Miami ! After Panama ... they 're ... it 's going to Miami ! In Florida , " Zhao insisted . " The sheet ... the lading bill ... it 's ... I swear ... it 's in my pocket ! Just make it stop ! " <p> Ellis reached into Zhao 's pocket and extracted the sheet of light pink paper that held all the details of the shipment 's arrival . <p> ... seven ... six ... five ... <p> The dog began to growl . She could smell death coming . But Ellis ignored the noise , peacefully reading from the bill of lading : the container 's new tracking number , the receiver 's name ( had to be fake ) everything the Leadership needed . <p> ... four ... three ... two ... <p> Still flat on his stomach and now with his mouth wide open , Zhao gave a final hollow gasp that sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drain . Ellis 's great- grandfather described the same sound in his diary-right after he mentioned there was no antidote for hemlock poisoning . <p> ... one . <p> Zhao was nice-even kind when they first met at the doctor 's funeral-but the mission was bigger than Zhao . And based on what happened in 1900 with Mitchell Siegel , the mission had enough problems with witnesses . <p> Zhao 's tongue went limp , and his head slumped forward , sending his forehead against the carpet . <p> Ellis did n't notice . He was already on his phone , dialing Judge Wojtowicz 's number . <p> " I told you not to call me here , Eddie , " answered an older man with a soft , crackly voice . <p> " Ellis . I 'm called Ellis now , " he replied , never losing his composure . He spread out his left hand , admiring the tattoo . <p> " It 's five in the morning here , Ellis . What do you want ? " <p> Ellis smiled-truly smiled-turning his full attention to the phone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you were when I found you , Judge . Your group-your Leadership-your dream was old and dead . Is that how you pictured your final years ? Just another discarded , cobwebbed old man sitting in his cramped Michigan apartment and wondering why his glory days were n't more glorious ? You 're not even a footnote in history , Judge . Not even an asterisk . But if you want , I can put you back there . Maybe one day you 'll be a parenthesis . " <p> " My family has been in the Leadership since- " <p> " Do n't embarrass yourself , Judge . Family names do n't get you into Harvard anymore ; what makes you think they 'll get you in here ? " <p> There was a long pause on the line . " I appreciate your helping us with this , Ellis , " the Judge finally offered . Clearing his throat , he added , " You 're close to finding the Book , are n't you ? " <p> " And about to get even closer , " Ellis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying the container 's new tracking details : when it left the port , when it 'd arrive in Miami , even the truck driver who was responsible for the pickup . <p> Harper , Lloyd . <p> " C'm on , Benoni , " he murmured to the dog . <p> He knew it was an odd name . Benoni . But according to the diaries , that was the name of Abel 's watchdog the dog that was eventually given to Cain and the only witness to the world 's first murder . <p> " You 're in for a treat , girl , " he said as he stepped over Zhao 's dead body and led the dog out into the hallway . " This time of year , the weather is gorgeous in Florida . " <p> As the dog ran ahead , Ellis never lost sight of her . He knew his history . Only with Benoni would he find the Book of Lies and solve the true mystery of the world 's greatest villain . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
