Eight years after signing the codicil to her best friend 's will , Lucy Vargas was celebrating her fortieth birthday with her closest companions and one perfect stranger . The stranger , a dance instructor and nutritionist who worked at the town 's newest fitness franchise , had been picked up along with the gift Lucy was opening , a small bracelet-size box wrapped in gold foil and festooned with white organza ribbon . <p> The present had been wrapped by Penelope 's stepsister , Clover Lindstrom , who was proud of her creativity , and of the guest she 'd brought to Lucy 's gathering . Who else would have thought of a Kick the Pounds ! certificate for a fortieth-birthday gift ? <p> Who else indeed ? Lucy was thinking , the color rising in her cheeks , prompting the stranger to wonder if the birthday girl was embarrassed at Clover 's generosity . <p> This question , like so many that the newcomer would raise about Lucy , was completely off the mark . <p> First of all , Lucy was not a blusher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's redheads , was the same unruffled bronze as countless generations of Spanish ancestors . It was n't the sort of tender-headed mood-ring complexion that broadcast its bearer 's emotions far and near . Besides , a meticulous observer would have noticed that the color change began with Lucy 's narrow nose , pinking up from her delicately curved nostrils and blossoming out to her wide cheekbones before rising to those unnaturally dark Sephardic eyebrows , plucked within an inch of their Mediterranean lives for this very occasion . <p> No , Lucy was not a blusher . Nor was she an ungrateful wretch . She knew precisely how lucky she was , the owner of this beautiful rambling house on the ocean , surrounded by friends from college , a painter who 'd established herself in the world of fine art . Nothing to sneeze at , her good fortune . <p> Why then , instead , would Lucy have been trying so hard not to cry ? <p> Was she sensitive about her generous figure , about turning forty without a husband , much less children ? This might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she to ponder the slight hiccup in Lucy 's manner , the lack of conviction in the way she had lifted her glass to her friends . <p> No , none of these complaints explained the sadness , which revealed itself only in the sudden tilt of Lucy 's shot glass , the way she winced at the Jack Daniel 's pouring down her lovely throat . <p> It still happened , going on two years , no matter how often she found herself ambushed by the very same impossible desire . Lucy 's first thought , opening the intricately wrapped box from Clover , had been a gleeful impulse to call Penelope and share the latest Clover Moment , over which the two would howl . <p> " You are such a bitch ! " Lucy 's unspoken admonition was aimed at herself , a private term of endearment , admiration even , that Lucy and Penelope had begun using in college and had tossed affectionately at each other ever since . " You bitch ! " they 'd crow , hugging each other , loving the way the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lately , Lucy had found herself repeating the words as a form of self-comfort and , simultaneously , a form of self-reproach . It was not the time to make a spectacle of herself , not in front of Penelope 's family , who were trying their best to make her happy on this special day . <p> Tessa , fourteen , had painted a card of Lucy 's childhood home in Charleston , copied painstakingly from one of her family albums . June , ten , had tricked out the dining room with crepe paper and balloons . Joey , his voice ragged from a nasty cold , had marked the auspicious occasion with a poignant anecdote about how he 'd met Lucy and Penelope at the University of Virginia . <p> Around the table , other celebrants had joined in with their own tales of yore . Martha and Susannah had gone to UVA too , had participated in the same revelries about which Joey was waxing so nostalgic , and Sateesh , Martha 's husband , had heard these stories so many times he felt he might as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penelope 's stepsister , hated it when people brought up the university , for she 'd not gotten in , in spite of her adoptive father 's intercessions on her behalf . Perhaps that was why , after Lucy opened her present , Clover had stood up and cleared her throat . She opened a large purple scroll she 'd lettered in silver verse . " Lucy , I wrote you a poem , " she said . " I was going to set it to music but I ran out of time . " <p> Clover placed her manicured hand on her heart . If Penny were here , I know she 'd say , <br> We 'll go to Paris , I promise , someday , <br> Until then , let 's lose that weight , <br> Just like your French sophist icate . <br> I 'll go too , <br> We 'll do it together , <br> And be best pals through nasty weather . <p> Clover stood , her trim figure enshrined in a pair of tan gingham capris with matching bustier . Her hands were clasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grateful to have been able to give Lucy such a useful present . <p> " I do n't know how to thank you , " Lucy had said gravely , pinching the skin at the inside of her elbow . She could not look at Martha or Susannah , or she would start laughing . Then they 'd all be forced to spend the rest of the night comforting Clover , whose neediness outstripped even her cluelessness , at least when it came to pressing Lucy 's buttons . <p> This was not something Lucy would ever say out loud . Still , the thought crept in from time to time , ever since that famous night eight years earlier , when Penelope had finally talked each of them into signing her contract . Initially , instead of quieting her fears as the signatories had expected , their capitulation only seemed to confirm the urgency of Penelope 's pessimism . She had spent the evening spelling out ever more precisely the things they must attend to in the event of her death . This included a complete catechism about taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By night 's end , Penelope had extracted numerous promises from each of them , promises not one of them expected to have to keep . <p> Even Penelope , whose imagination had been formidable , could n't have known how things would turn out ; she was just being herself , her lovably worried self . Nothing pleased her more than to talk about her impending death from a plane crash , a car wreck , killer bees or a brain tumor masquerading as a migraine , unless it was , of course , her epitaph or her funeral . " Let Clover sing . She 'll be the center of attention . " <p> " Well , no better time than a funeral for the voice of an angel . " <p> Lucy was alluding to a compliment Clover had gotten in her teenage pageant days and could n't help but introduce into conversation at the oddest times , no matter how far-flung , no matter how off topic . <p> " Do n't be mean , now , " Penelope had scolded , overcome with guilt at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverence , her dainty elocution . <p> If there was one thing Lucy knew , it was how much they all loved Clover , even when she was driving them completely crazy . For that , Penelope deserved a huge amount of credit . " Oh , stop feeling guilty , you 've been great to her . Nicer than her own mother , for goodness sake . " <p> " Hard to be meaner , hon , " Penelope had murmured . <br> <p> For Penelope , playing God had certain spillover effects , for her view of human nature was almost supernaturally forgiving . Clover might have seemed shallow , even silly , to most people , but Penelope had observed the damage inflicted on her stepsister at an early age . There was the fact that Clover 's mother had eventually abandoned her , and then there were the two years before that , when Tabitha had been married to Penelope 's father . This was a period that Penelope liked to call the " reign of terror , poise and cosmetics , " when Mommy Dearest had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional competitions of Tiny Confederate Dames of the South . By the time they attended that last contest in Savannah , Tabitha had already met her next husband , a bass boat magnate from Montgomery . The man apparently did n't care for children , but such conclusions were way beyond Clover 's six-year-old ken . No , for Clover , the explanation was obvious . Having failed to place in the semifinals , she would just have to try harder to become the sort of person who pleased her mother enough to bring her back . <p> " You have to take care of her , " Penelope had insisted the night they 'd agreed to the contract , holding the champagne bottle over Lucy 's glass without pouring , a quid pro quo in the making . <p> " Stop it , " Lucy had laughed . " We 're all going to be little old ladies together . " <p> " I mean it . " <p> " I know you do . That 's the saddest part . " <p> Lucy often thought back to this conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though some prescient inkling must have been telling her otherwise . How could we have known ? Lucy asked herself regularly , a mantra against the guilt she felt for dismissing her friend 's fears . <p> Up to the very moment your life changed , it was impossible to abandon the survival tactic some people called optimism , others denial . Lucy would come to see it as the nanvetT of youth . Disasters were something that happened to other unfortunate souls , a conviction she 'd gripped tight up to the very last moment , when a ringing phone delivered incomprehensible news . <p> Their particular cataclysm had hit on Thanksgiving morning , nearly two years before Lucy 's fortieth birthday . Joey 's plane had been delayed , and so Penelope had gone by herself to deliver a carload of food to an impoverished family . She 'd left Tessa and June at home with Rocky , their golden retriever , and rushed along a country road , almost certainly rushing , knowing her girls were alone . <p> As it turned out , the recipient of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held at gunpoint by her estranged husband . When Penelope arrived , honking festively in the driveway , she 'd been invited inside to join the party . <p> They all took comfort in knowing it could n't have lasted too long , medical examiners ' estimates being what they were , confirmed by neighbors ' testimony about the timing of the horn honking and the shotgun going off . And whatever else she 'd suffered , there must have been a flicker , at least , of something else , an imp in Penelope that would appear even in the darkest moment to say , See , I told you so . <br> <p> After the murder , Joey and the girls had moved out to Lucy 's beach house . Staying home had been too hard . Everything in the family 's house shouted Penelope 's name , and every corner seemed like she 'd be coming around it , rescuing them all from this terrible dream they 'd been living . It was dysfunctional , or so most people said , but in the midst of shock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could make the girls feel better . Joey had continued to work in the foundation offices , which adjoined the family 's large gray Victorian house near the town square . Over the second summer , the girls had begun spending small chunks of time there , between day camps and classes . They 'd even started to reinhabit their former bedrooms during the day , as a place to entertain friends or catch a nap , but at night , the family always slept at Lucy 's . <p> It was n't anything anyone had planned , but with Joey 's travel schedule , it had just seemed easier and less disruptive for the girls to live in one place . Without really discussing it , the three of them had drifted into the habit of staying at Lucy 's more or less permanently , without ever making a formal decision . <p> A similar inertia had emptied the guest rooms of Lucy 's bed-and-breakfast , which she 'd closed as soon as the last Thanksgiving guest had checked out two years earlier . Its clientele , many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were refused a second year . Eventually calls simply stopped coming in . Every now and then Lucy would tell herself it was time to think about reopening her doors , a thought that was quickly followed by the crushing sense that none of them , least of all Tessa and June , were prepared to go back to business as usual.Copyright 2009 by Sheila Curran <br> Continues ...
