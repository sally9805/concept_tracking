<p> In 1849 a troop of soldiers was ordered to northeast Texas to protect settlers scattered along the wild Southern plains . One soldier wrote : " Buffalo all around . There were more panthers than I have seen before or since . Antelope without number , and wild turkeys in every tree . " <p> The soldiers built a fort and named it in honor of Maj. Gen. William Jenkins Worth . <p> Fort Worth , Texas was born . <p> Skip ahead 17 years to 1866 , the first full year of peace since the Civil War ended . As in most wars , sacrifices were called for , but with the fighting over , those who did their parts desired the good life again . They wanted shoes on their children 's feet and meat on the kitchen table . In Texas , longhorns were running free on the open range . If only Texans could get these cattle to a railroad , what a beef bonanza there would be . <p> Young men were hired to drive the longhorns along the Chisholm Trail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oklahoma ) to Abilene , Kan. , the closest railroad stop . <p> An American icon , the cowboy , was born . <p> Today in the Fort Worth Stockyards District , the cowboy culture that lasted not that many years and the much longer mythology surrounding it , still are celebrated in high style . <p> Fort Worth might top the short list of Texas cities trying hardest to preserve and perpetuate their Western history . True West Magazine recently named it one of " America 's 50 most Western towns " - Amarillo , Dallas , El Paso and San Antonio also made the list , which did not include Austin or Houston . <p> Even with the vaunted cultural offerings of such institutions as Kimbell Art Museum , Bass Performance Hall and a new modern arts museum , Fort Worth keeps the cowboy and cowgirl side of its image in sharp focus . <p> " No other major city in Texas offers such a distinct , iconic Western personality , " says Greg Staley , director of communications for the Fort Worth Convention &; Visitors Bureau . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life - from our personality to the attractions and architecture and even the cuisine . Fort Worth consciously preserves ( its ) Western heritage . " <p> At the heart of that saddle-and-rope image is the Stockyards District , where twice a day roughly a dozen cattle are corralled and driven down Exchange Avenue to an observation area , where visitors gaze at the 2,000-pound animals with 6-foot horn spans . Modern-day cowboys , dressed in authentic 1880s attire , chat with visitors about cattle and the industry that turned this fort city on the plains into Cowtown USA . <p> The Stockyards District , designated a national historic district , is one of Fort Worth 's fattest cash cows for tourism . There 's no way to measure how many people visit the district , says Staley , but people come from " far and near . In many cases , it is the mind 's image of Texas . And it 's authentic . " <p> One of the best ways to see it is to invest in a guided walking tour of the district , where many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art and apparel , and restaurants serving catfish and barbecue . <p> Many tourists who browse the stores in Stockyards Station or along Exchange Avenue and Main Street think they 've seen the stockyards . What they 've seen is a prime example of adaptive reuse . The walking tour lets visitors inside places that would otherwise deny them entrance . And even the settings they can enter mean little without words to put them in the perspective of history . <p> For example , a guide explains that cattle drives continued along the Chisholm Trail well into the 1890s , when Fort Worth boosters began seriously looking into building their own meatpacking plants . <p> As a Fort Worth newspaper put it , " Steaks should be sweet and juicy . Yet , cattle arrive in the North exhausted from riding in a crowded boxcar with little food or water . They suffer shrinkage . The juices in their meat have evaporated . And those Northerners must eat dry , tasteless steak . " <p> Local prayers were answered by corporate gods named Armour and Swift . The Chicago-based meatpacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Northerners now had their steaks sweet and juicy . <p> In the late 1950s they still had sweet and juicy steaks , although Fort Worth 's big plants had less to do with it . By then trucks were moving meat . Since proximity to a railroad was no longer necessary , there were smaller , streamlined competitors . The huge packing plant was an anachronism . Armour shut down its Fort Worth plant in 1962 ; Swift in 1971 . The plants were razed . Armour 's office burned in the late 1960s . <p> Swift 's office is today an Italian restaurant . <p> A guide escorts visitors to the top of an elevated catwalk to look over rows and rows of animal pens , where cattle once lived in one-room , open-air apartments . Today it 's a livestock ghost town , with cement troughs and brick floors still in place . <p> Why were cattle pens paved with brick ? Brick is fireproof and easy to wash with a hose , and clean animals in the stockyard meant clean animals at the packing house . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , to hold cattle for sales of special breeds . <p> The view from the catwalk stretches from the cattle pens to the downtown skyline two miles distant - iron and wood below with a backdrop of steel and glass . <p> In 1960 , an auction arena was built . Cattle were taken from the pens to the arena , where they were paraded past buyers . Today most cattle are sold in the Livestock Exchange Building via closed-circuit television . Animals no longer have to be moved and cattlemen no longer need to leave their homes . A camera operator takes a portable camera into the pasture and videotapes the cattle . Broker representatives in Fort Worth take bids by phone from ranchers across the country . <p> You do n't have to be on the guided tour to enter the Stockyards Museum . It holds a pleasant clutter of items no early 20th century resident of Fort Worth would have been without , including a washboard , a sewing machine and saddles . There are also Swift and Armour employee group photographs taken during the Great Depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented here , " says Sue McCafferty , former president of the North Fort Worth Historical Society . " Czechs , Greeks , Germans , as well as blacks and Hispanics all worked here . Each had their own church , which was also their cultural center . " <p> The museum is inside the Livestock Exchange Building , built in 1902 in the Spanish mission style . According to McCafferty , the building was long known as the " Wall Street of the West . " Commission companies had offices here , along with a bank , post office and rail and telegraph offices . Activity was as hectic as it was on the floor at the other Wall Street . Today things are more placid . The offices of the Texas Angus Association , Superior Livestock Auction ( a video auction production company ) and several unrelated businesses are here . <p> The noise and commotion of yesterday have been transferred a bit north to a former animal exhibition barn now home to Billy Bob 's Texas , promoted as the world 's largest honky-tonk ( capacity 6,000 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob 's , where the best of country music have left their own souvenirs .
