Lincoln as Political Scripture the year was 1992 . The scene was the Republican National Convention in Houston , Texas . Republicans were about to renominate President George Bush for a second term and then return home to try convincing American voters that the nation 's economic recession had little to do with the Republican Party , its philosophy , or its standard-bearer . The task must have seemed daunting . In the end it proved impossible , but for one brief moment the goal seemed within their grasp . That was when the much-loved former president , Ronald Reagan , arrived at the speaker 's rostrum to rouse the faithful to a renewed dedication to modern Republican ideals . // He did so by invoking the name of Lincoln . Exhuming a credo that President Reagan told us had been " so eloquently stated " by Lincoln generations earlier , the fortieth president quoted what he described as four of Lincoln 's most appealing maxims . Here was a hallowed set of principles , Reagan declared , that had stood the test of time and deserved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a resurgent liberalism . To some people listening to Reagan that night , the phrases must have seemed crafted to rebut with uncanny specificity the rise of Governor William Jefferson Clinton of Arkansas . As the newly anointed Democratic challenger to twelve consecutive years of Republican White House rule and leading in all the public-opinion polls , Clinton posed a formidable threat to Reagan 's conservative revolution . Now Reagan summoned all of his rhetorical gifts to remind the hundreds of delegates packing the convention hall and the tens of millions more watching on television that another Republican , Abraham Lincoln , had once wisely offered the following timeless truths : // You can not strengthen the weak by weakening the strong . // You can not help the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer . // You can not help the poor man by destroying the rich . // You can not help men permanently by doing for them what they could and should do for themselves . // The convention floor erupted in waves of applause . TV cameras captured the faces of emotional delegates whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels upon hearing a revered pastor deliver a grand sermon . Reagan had resurrected a tablet of political commandments more prescient and eloquent than any arid Republican Party platform or windy acceptance speech . No one had ever said it better than the Great Emancipator as revivified by the Great Communicator . It was a magical combination . As politics and performance , even liberal Democrats admitted that it was good . // As it turned out , it was indeed too good to be true . In fact , Lincoln had never uttered a word of it . The lines turned out to be the work of an obscure German-born , Brooklyn-ordained minister named William John Henry Boetcker , and they dated back to only 1916-fifty-one years after Lincoln 's death . That year , Boetcker published a tract entitled Lincoln on Private Property . The pamphlet featured a unique format : the true words of Lincoln on one page followed by interpretive quotations from Boetcker on the next . The ideas quickly found an appreciative audience among conservatives . Republican clubs clamored for copies , and the booklet went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unfortunately , in each subsequent incarnation Boetcker progressively receded into the background until Lincoln was receiving sole and undeserved credit for aphorisms he had never uttered . One later edition boasted that the words were Lincoln 's exclusively and were published at the " inspiration of William J. H. Boetcker . " By the time Ronald Reagan got around to quoting these lines , the true source of the inspiration had faded into the shadows . When the truth finally surfaced , a Reagan spokesman , scrambling for an explanation , said that the former president had done all his own research . As the sole author of the speech he had found the " Lincoln " quotations in a book called The Toastmaster 's Treasure Chest by one Herbert V. Prochnow . It was passed off as an understandable mistake , but it is an indelible one . // Few of the millions who heard Reagan that summer night ever read the explanations or the corrections published in newspapers during the days following his remarks . Nor did they learn that with a brilliant editorial stroke , Reagan had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seem to fit his call for fealty to Republican principles 1992-style . After all , how could the chief executive who had presided over the accumulation of the most massive federal deficit and debt in the nation 's entire history possibly say : // You can not keep out of trouble by spending more than your income . // You can not establish security on borrowed money . // Ronald Reagan deleted those phrases from his recitation . But he had said enough to lay powerful , if spurious , claim to Lincoln 's political blessings . Three full years after scholars had discredited Reagan 's Houston Lincoln reference , one of the most widely read newspaper columnists in the nation blithely published the Boetcker quotes once again . To Ann Landers , the words Reagan had quoted still seemed irresistibly Lincolnian. // Claiming the mantle of Lincoln started long before President Reagan 's faux pas . It has been part of the fabric of political discourse practically from the moment Lincoln was assassinated on Good Friday , 1865-barely a week after restoring peace to a country torn by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches throughout the north that Easter Sunday , Lincoln was confirmed as a secular saint . That was a nearly miraculous elevation for one who was among the most severely criticized of all of our presidents : Lincoln had been mocked , scorned , and ridiculed by much of the nation until he was lifted above the clamor by his martyrdom . Gone was the hateful derision . To many , he had suddenly become a second Moses , proclaiming liberty throughout the country but perishing before he could enjoy the promised land ; to others , he was an American savior dying for the sins of his bitterly divided people . // Before long , politicians took up where preachers had left off . In the furious debate over postwar Reconstruction , conservatives and so-called radicals both claimed they were pursuing the path to reconciliation that Lincoln himself had charted . Then at the dawn of the twentieth century , Democrats like William Jennings Bryan began suggesting that they , too , might be entitled to claim a portion of Lincoln 's legacy . An angry New York Times article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a rebuke " to such Democratic presumption , but the indignation of the Times did nothing to inhibit the Democrats . Lincoln 's reputation , buoyed by the centennial observances of his birth , remained high ; and competition to claim Lincoln for political inspiration and advantage came to embrace all political faiths . A golden age of Lincoln literature was just getting underway , and politicians were eager to lay claim to its riches . It would have been unnatural for politicians not to clamber aboard the bandwagon . // Theodore Roosevelt , who as a child had viewed Lincoln 's funeral procession in New York City , proudly confided to White House correspondents that he kept a portrait of Lincoln behind his presidential desk . " When I am confronted with a great problem , " he explained . " I look up to that picture , and I do as I believe Lincoln would have done . " Roosevelt felt comfortable pursuing what he called a " Jackson-Lincoln theory of the presidency , " meaning that he would be an active executive prepared to do even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt claimed , had practiced " tempered radicalism , " and so would he . By then the competition to claim Lincoln had come to embrace all political faiths . By the time the 1912 election rolled around , Democrat Woodrow Wilson felt compelled to establish an association of his own with the great Lincoln . Explaining that he was in search of the unique inspiration Lincoln could provide , the Democratic nominee even made a pilgrimage to the sacred and hitherto exclusively Republican mecca of Springfield , Illinois , Lincoln 's hometown. //
