Chapter One It was the kind of October day for which reasidents of New Orleans endure the summers , sparkling blue-gold with just a touch of crispness , and two old friends were sitting on a low branch of an oak tree in Audubon Park drinking liquor . They had started out with tequila shots upon waking up , but harboring a residual grudge against the drink , they soon switched to vodka and orange juice , which they carried to the park in a large thermos . John Rickey and Gary " G-man " Stubbs had been born and raised in the city 's Lower Ninth Ward , but they 'd lived Uptown since they were eighteen : " From the ' hood to the ghetto , " Rickey had described the move at the time . Their current neighborhood hardly qualified as a ghetto , but the remark revealed a downtown boy 's discomfort at living Uptown . In the Ninth Ward , " Uptown " signified rich and snooty . They were twenty-seven now , but only Rickey had begun to develop the comfortable little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra pounds did not diminish his sharp-featured good looks , but he would n't have cared much if they had ; physical vanity was not among Rickey 's numerous sources of anxiety . Six months ago he had bleached his light-brown hair platinum . Now it was half split ends and half dark roots , and though it looked very bad , he had n't yet gotten around to having the bleachy ends cut off . Since he had neglected to brush it this morning , it formed a two-toned nimbus around his head . Rickey was a young man with a great deal of nervous energy ; even when he was half-drunk and trying to relax , he had a hard time sitting still . G-man had no trouble sitting still . He was a little taller than Rickey , and quite skinny for a New Orleanian . Though he wore his chestnut-colored hair very short , a slight curl still made it unruly most of the time . His mother had been a Bonano , one of the city 's vast population of Sicilian-Americans , but this heritage was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Otherwise he looked like his Irish-blooded father , rangy and fair-skinned , with a long blunt nose and a rather sensitive mouth . Like many young men in New Orleans , Rickey and G-man made a precarious living in restaurant kitchens . They 'd begun in their teens as dishwashers and worked their way up to line cook positions . Now cooking comprised most of their lives ; asked to define themselves in a word , they would not have given their family names or ( as would many New Orleanians ) the name of their high school ; they would simply have said , " We 're cooks . " A few days ago they had been dismissed from their latest kitchen in what they considered a travesty of justice . Jesse Honeycombe , a country-pop crooner from Florida , had one big radio hit called " Tequilatown " and opened a restaurant on the strength of it . Tequilatown was a French Quarter tourist trap that served indifferently barbecued ribs , elaborate sandwich platters , and margaritas in plastic buckets . Jesse Honeycombe was n't exactly responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rickey and G-man , who had been cursing Honeycombe 's name ever since the incident went down . Honeycombe had played a show at the Lakefront Arena that night , and fans packed the restaurant afterward in hopes that he would show up . The kitchen was slammed . Rickey was working the hot appetizer station , making loaded nacho platters and spicy chicken quesadillas . G-man , for some reason , was on salads , the most hated position in the kitchen . Everyone from the kitchen runners to the head chef was in the weeds for three solid hours . They fell into a rhythm where they were n't really thinking about the food or how many tickets were lined up ; they were just moving their hands and hustling their asses and slamming out orders as fast as they possibly could . When the hellacious rush finally slowed to a trickle , Chef Jerod passed around cold bottles of Abita beer . Drinking was forbidden on the clock at Tequilatown , a restaurant with liquor in its very name , but the crew had rolled so hard tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule . Of course , the manager chose that moment to drop in and see how things were going . Chef Jerod managed to hang onto his job by the tips of his knife-scarred fingernails , but the manager made him fire almost everyone else , including Rickey and G-man . This would create no crisis ; there were half-assed kitchen workers looking for jobs all over town . The hospitality industry provided New Orleans with its major source of revenue , and the city responded by providing an inexhaustible source of fodder for the industry : poor but able-bodied young men who came into the kitchens with very little training and could be easily replaced when they got fired , quit , or died . Most of these young men were black , but there was a sizable minority of white boys . Some , like Rickey and G-man , stayed in the business and became skilled cooks . A place like Tequilatown , though , did n't really need skilled cooks ; it made sense to replace them with hapless kids who would work for considerably less money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the severance pay envelopes . Though he was a hardass , he was almost weeping with humiliation . " I swear I 'd quit this place myself if they were n't paying me so fucking much , " he said . No one really held it against him . They knew that the manager , Brian Danton , was the real asshole . That was almost always how it was , and there was nothing you could do about managers . So now Rickey and G-man sat in the park passing the thermos , watching the joggers and golfers , occasionally expressing mild amazement at the fact that people would expend that kind of energy when they did n't have to . This was not simple laziness-though they could be lazy with a will-but more a reflection on the sheer physical work of being a halfway-decent cook . Cooks on the line in a busy restaurant spend all their time in motion , preparing the mise-en-place of ingredients they will use throughout their shift , lining up saut pans on burners and flattops , keeping track of their tickets , burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stinking flesh that feel like nothing more than a couple of raw stumps by the end of a shift . Cooks do n't go jogging on their day off . Rickey and G-man had been friends since their grammar school days . The Lower Ninth Ward was a cross between a country village and a Third World slum , far below the Garden District and the French Quarter and the other parts of the city known to tourists . Most of the houses were old , small , and in disrepair ; the streets were prone to sudden flooding ; the air smelled of frying sausage and the nearby Industrial Canal . Rickey and G-man had Ninth Ward street smarts and the hoarse , full-throated downtown accent : " Ax ya momma can we have some'a dem cookies she bought ? " They had always been vaguely aware of each other , as the few white kids in the public schools were . The first time they really took notice of each other was in fourth grade , during Job Week , when the class was assigned to pair up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' occupations . Even at age nine , Rickey and G-man ( then still known as Gary ) recognized the thoughtless cruelty inherent in this assignment . Many of their classmates had mothers who worked at McDonald 's or as hotel maids , and no fathers to speak of . It was n't that all black people in New Orleans lived this way , but that the black people who could afford it-just like the white people who could afford it-sent their kids to the superior Catholic schools . Rickey 's father was a chiropractor who lived in California , paid minimal child support , and had n't seen his son in three years . As a result , Rickey had a distorted idea of what chiropractors ( and fathers ) did . He and Gary stole a box of red hair dye from the K &B; drugstore and borrowed a bunch of Play-Doh from one of Gary 's young cousins . Two dowels provided the framework for a surprisingly realistic false arm with a plastic bag of dye tucked into the shoulder end . Gary folded his right arm inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A chiropractor is a doctor who performs adjustments on the spine , " Rickey told the class before bending Gary backward and " adjusting " him , ripping off the false arm and spraying red hair dye all over the classroom . Gary howled in " pain " and collapsed dramatically on the threadbare school carpet , his legs flailing a bit before hitting the floor with a terrible , final-sounding thunk . That was the first time they were sent to the principal 's office together . They had to apologize to their teacher and explain to their classmates that doctor visits were unlikely to result in surprise dismemberments . Gary 's mother , who had never known her youngest child to do such a thing before , made him go to confession and tell the priest all about it . ( He thought he heard the priest stifle a laugh , but he never told his mother . ) Rickey 's mother , who had been something of a bon vivant in her youth , found the episode hilarious . She called up the Stubbs family to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up friends . To Rickey , an only child , the crowded Stubbs household was pleasantly chaotic ; some of Gary 's five older sisters and brothers had grown up and moved out by then , but they had kids of their own and there were always children around . After the false-arm incident , Rickey and Gary got beaten up a lot less , because their classmates now thought they were funny , crazy , or both . More important , they recognized something in each other that had kept them together from then until now , fired and broke , sitting in an oak tree drinking liquor . Rickey pushed his hair out of his eyes . " It 's too damn bright out here , " he said . " Can I borrow your extra shades ? " " They 're prescription . " G-man had already been wearing glasses in the fourth grade ; from his ferocious squint when he removed them , Rickey always figured he 'd been one of those little kids who 'd needed them since he was three or something . Now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen when chefs would let him get away with it . " I do n't care , " said Rickey . " Just give ' em here . " G-man stretched out his long legs , reached into his pants pocket , and pulled out a slightly squashed pair of gold-rimmed , pimp-daddy-style dark glasses . He passed them to Rickey , who put them on , surveyed the park through what appeared to be several inches of murky water , and said , " Goddamn , your eyes are fucked up . " G-man had heard this before and let it pass without comment . " This orange juice is warm , " Rickey complained . " I wish I had a daiquiri . " " You want to walk over to the zoo ? I think they got daiquiris in the Beer Garden . " " No , dude , it 's like seven dollars to get in the zoo . You know where I wish I was , G ? I wish I was in Tequilatown . " " Scratchin my balls and watchin the sun go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's big hit . " Pickin sea salt outta my ass crack ... " They went on in this vein for several minutes , an extension of the dialogue they 'd been having since the incident . Though they were trying to console themselves , the thing always ended up making them mad all over again . This time , Rickey went off first . " Fuck that place ! " An old lady walking a Chihuahua near their tree gave him a sharp look , but he took no notice . " Fuck Jesse Honeycombe , fuck Brian Danton , and fuck Jerod Biggs too . Fuck ' em all . " " Rickey ... " " What ? We 're the victims of injustice . It sucks . " " This does n't suck , " G-man pointed out . " It 's a beautiful day , and right now the poor bastards they hired are prepping dinner and getting ready to take it in the ass all night , and we 're sitting here drinking . Tell me how that sucks . " " I 'll tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're a real cheerer-upper , you know that ? " " Well , damn , G. We got about two hundred dollars in the bank . Favreau 's not gon na give us another extension . " Favreau was the landlord who rented them a shotgun cottage on the river end of Marengo Street . They were fortunate that he was a patient man ; nonetheless , the mention of his name depressed them further . The October shine had gone off the day . They rocked glumly back and forth on the tree limb . Rickey drained the last of the vodka and orange juice . " Tequilatown 's a shithole . But did you ever notice how much money it 's making ? " " About a hundred grand a week , I 'd say . " " And the food is garbage . All Honeycombe has is a name . You know , G , we could run a better restaurant than Tequilatown . " " Uh huh . " " We could , " said Rickey . " We 're good cooks . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high school-almost ten years ago now-Rickey had even spent several months in Hyde Park , New York , at the fabled CIA , the Culinary Institute of America , hardcore training ground for chefs all over the country . He did well there until a run-in with another student resulted in his return to New Orleans , which was not an entirely unhappy thing : living up north was expensive and cold , and he was lost without G-man . " Course we 're good cooks , " said G-man . " But it takes more than that . Like money . " " We might could raise some money if we had a good idea . " " Lots of people get ideas . Remember Lamar King 's Bordello ? " This had been a failed concept by another washed-up rock star , his claim to fame being that he had once shared a stage with Bob Dylan . He and his backers had bought a huge , decrepit building in the French Quarter , spent millions of dollars bringing it up to code and decorating it to look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look like : lots of red velvet swags , stained glass , a grand piano . The menu had boasted items like " Pretty Baby Prime Rib " and " Aphrodisiac Oysters . " The place closed its doors within a month . Rickey and G-man had passed several afternoons in various bars debating why a rock star would want to open a restaurant anyway . Rickey posited that chefs were actually cooler than rock stars , and Lamar King knew it . G-man thought King might have been around the amps too long . Rickey was lost in thought . He held the empty thermos in his hand , staring into its shiny depths . A faint distorted reflection of his own eye winked up at him , blue and bloodshot . Lots of people get ideas , G-man had said , but how many of those ideas were good ones ? More to the point , how many of those ideas were suitable for New Orleans ? Plenty of would-be restaurateurs came from out of town , opened a place , watched it fail , and left cursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tastes , or all of the above . Rickey was used to all that . Surely he could come up with an idea for a restaurant that would be uniquely suited to his lifelong home . He tilted the thermos and watched one last drop spill out , and that was when it came to him . ( Continues ... )
