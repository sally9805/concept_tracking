It took 1 hour 42 minutes from the first impact at 8:46 a.m. until the collapse of the second building . Papers scattered in the implosion were found for miles around . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : People leapt 90 stories to escape the flames : At the height of our unchallenged power came a moment we never expected to see again : Americans running for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Americans found strength amid the rubble and a measure of hope in grief : New Yorkers take pride in being cosmopolitan , but the attacks reminded them that in a crisis , you do n't turn for help to Gstaad or Tuscany .
