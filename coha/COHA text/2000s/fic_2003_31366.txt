He needed me . Whenever anyone usually a reporter asked me how I coped with a man like Jimmie , I smiled and said nothing . I 'd learned that whatever I said would be misquoted , so I simply kept quiet . Once , I made the mistake of telling the truth to a female reporter . She 'd looked so young and so in need herself that for a moment I let my guard down . I said , " He needs me . " That 's all . Just those three words . Who would have thought that a second of unguarded honesty could cause so much turmoil ? The girl she had certainly not attained the maturity of womanhood parlayed my small sentence into international turmoil . I was right in thinking she herself was needy . Oh , yes , very needy . She needed a story , so she fabricated one . Never mind that she had nothing on which to base her fable . I must say that she was good at research . She could n't have slept during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . She consulted psychiatrists , self-help gurus , and clergy . She interviewed hordes of rampant feminists . Every famous woman who had ever hinted that she hated men was interviewed and quoted . In the end Jimmie and I were portrayed as one sick couple . He was the domineering tyrant in public , but a whimpering child at home . And I was shown to be a cross between steel and an ever-flowing breast . When the article came out and caused a sensation , I wanted to hide from the world . I wanted to retreat to the most remote of Jimmie 's twelve houses and never leave . But Jimmie was afraid of nothing which was the true secret of his success and he met the questions , the derisive laughter , and worse , the pseudo-therapists who felt it was our " duty " to expose every private thought and feeling to the world , head-on . Jimmie just put his arm around me , smiled into the cameras , and laughed in answer to all of their questions . Whatever they asked , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , Mr. Manville , that your wife is the power behind the throne ? " The reporter asking this was smiling at me in a nasty way . Jimmie was six foot two and built like the bull some people said he was , and I am five foot two and round . I 've never looked like the power behind anyone . " She makes all the decisions . I 'm just her front man , " Jimmie said , his smile showing his famous teeth . But those of us who knew him saw the coldness in his eyes . Jimmie did n't like any disparagement of what he considered his . " I could n't have done it without her , " he said in that teasing way of his . Few people knew him well enough to know whether or not he was joking . Three weeks later , by chance , I saw the cameraman who 'd been with the reporter that day . He was a favorite of mine because he did n't delight in sending his editor the pictures of me that showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What happened to your friend who was so interested in my marriage ? " I asked , trying to sound friendly . " Fired , " the photographer said . " I beg your pardon ? " He was pushing new batteries into his camera and did n't look up . " Fired , " he said again , then looked up , not at me , but at Jimmie . Wisely , the photographer said no more . And just as wisely , I did n't ask any more questions . Jimmie and I had an unwritten , unspoken law : I did n't interfere in whatever Jimmie was doing . " Like a Mafia wife , " my sister said to me about a year after Jimmie and I were married . " Jimmie does n't murder people , " I replied in anger . That night I told Jimmie of the exchange with my sister , and for a moment his eyes glittered in a way that , back then , I had n't yet learned to be wary of . A month later , my sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary ; free housing ; free cars . A full-time nanny for their daughter , three maids , and a country club membership were included . It was a job they could n't refuse . It was in Morocco . After Jimmie 's plane crashed and left me a widow at thirty-two , all the media around the world wrote of only one thing : that Jimmie had willed me " nothing . " None of his billions two or twenty of them , I never could remember how many none of it was left to me . " Are we broke or rich today ? " I 'd often ask him , because his net worth fluctuated from day to day , depending on what Jimmie was trying at the moment . " Today we 're broke , " he 'd say , and he would laugh in the same way as when he 'd tell me he 'd made so many millions that day . The money never mattered to Jimmie . No one understood that . To him , it was just a by-product of the game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after you 've made jam , " he 'd say . " Only in this case the world values the peel and not the jam . " " Poor world , " I said , then Jimmie laughed hard and carried me upstairs , where he made sweet love to me . It 's my opinion that Jimmie knew he was n't going to live to be an old man . " I 've got to do what I can as fast as I can . You with me , Frecks ? " he 'd ask . " Always , " I 'd answer , and I meant it . " Always . " But I did n't follow him to the grave . I was left behind , just as Jimmie said I would be . " I 'll take care of you , Frecks , " he said more than once . When he talked of such things , he always called me by the name he 'd given me the first time we met : Frecks for the freckles across my nose . When he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't give the words much thought . Jimmie had always " taken care " of me . Whatever I wanted , he gave me long before I knew I wanted it . Jimmie said , " I know you better than you know yourself . " And he did . But then , to be fair , I never had time to get to know much about myself . Following Jimmie all over the world did n't leave a person much time to sit and contemplate . Jimmie knew me , and he did take care of me . Not in the way the world thought was right , but in the way he knew I needed . He did n't leave me a rich widow with half the world 's bachelors clamoring to profess love for me . No , he left the money and all twelve of the expensive houses to the only two people in the world he truly hated : his older sister and brother . To me , Jimmie left a run-down , overgrown farm in the backwoods of Virginia , a place I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : Find out the truth about what happened , will you , Frecks ? Do it for me . And remember that I love you . Wherever you are , whatever you do , remember that I love you . J. When I saw the farmhouse , I burst into tears . What had enabled me to survive the past six weeks was the image of that farmhouse . I 'd imagined something charming , made of logs , with a stone chimney at one end . I 'd imagined a deep porch with hand-hewn rocking chairs on it , and a lawn in front , with pink roses spilling petals in the breeze . I 'd envisioned acres of gently rolling land covered with fruit trees and raspberry bushes all of them pruned and healthy and dripping ripe fruit . But what I saw was 1960s hideous . It was a two-story house covered in some sort of green siding the kind that never changes over the years . Storms , sun , snow , time , none of it had any effect on that kind of siding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was installed , and now , many years later , it was the same color . There were vines growing up one side of the house , but not the kind of vines that make a place look quaint and cozy . These were vines that looked as though they were going to engulf the house , eat it raw , digest it , then regurgitate it in the same ghastly green . " It can be fixed , " Phillip said softly from beside me . In the weeks since Jimmie 's death , " hell " could not begin to describe what I had been through . It was Phillip who woke me in the middle of the night when Jimmie 's plane went down . I must say that I was shocked to see him . As Jimmie 's wife , I was sacrosanct . The men he surrounded himself with knew what would happen if they made any advances toward me . I do n't mean just sexually , but in any other way . No man or woman in Jimmie 's employ ever asked me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been fired , he knew that to approach me and ask that I try to " reason " with Jimmie would likely earn him something far worse than a mere dismissal . So when I awoke to Jimmie 's top lawyer 's hand on my shoulder , telling me that I had to get up , I immediately knew what had happened . Only if Jimmie were dead would anyone dare enter my bedroom and think that he 'd live to see the dawn . " How ? " I asked , immediately wide awake and trying to be mature . Inside , I was shaking . Of course it could n't be true , I told myself . Jimmie was too big , too alive , to be ... to be ... I could n't form the word in my mind . " You have to get dressed now , " Phillip was saying . " We have to keep this secret for as long as we can . " " Is Jimmie hurt ? " I asked , my voice full of hope . Maybe he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as I thought it , I knew it was n't true . Jimmie knew how I worried about him . " I 'd rather have my foot cut off than have to deal with your fretting , " he 'd said more than once . He hated my nagging about his smoking , about his drinking , about his days without sleep . " No , " Phillip said , his voice cold and hard . His eyes looked into mine . " James is not alive . " I wanted to collapse . I wanted to dive back under the warm bedcovers and go back to sleep . And when I awoke again , I wanted Jimmie to be there , slipping his big hand under my nightgown and making those little growling sounds that made me giggle . " You do n't have time for grief right now , " Phillip said . " We have to go shopping . " That brought me out of my shock . " Are you mad ? " I asked him . " It 's four o'clock in the morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now get dressed ! " he ordered . " We have no time to lose . " His tone did n't scare me in the least . I sat down on the bed , my big nightgown billowing out around me , and I pulled my braid out from under me . Jimmie liked for me to wear old-fashioned clothes , and he liked for my hair to be long . After sixteen years of marriage , I could sit on my braid . " I 'm not going anywhere until you tell me what 's going on . " " I do n't have time now " Phillip began , but then he stopped , took a deep breath , and looked at me . " I could be disbarred for this , but I made out James 's will , and I know what 's coming to you . I can hold off the vultures for a few days but no more . Until the will is read , you 're still James 's wife . " " I will always be Jimmie 's wife , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bravest stance I could muster . Jimmie ! my heart was crying . Not Jimmie . Anyone on earth could die , but not Jimmie . " Lillian , " Phillip said softly , his eyes full of pity , " there was only one man like James Manville ever made on this earth . He played by his own rules and no one else 's . " I waited for him to tell me something that I did n't already know . What was he leading up to ? Phillip ran his hand over his eyes and glanced at the clock on the bed . " By the law of ethics , I ca n't tell you " he began , then he let out his breath and sat down heavily on the bed beside me . If I 'd needed any further proof that Jimmie was no longer alive , that would have been it . If there was a chance that Jimmie would walk through the door and see another man sitting on the bed beside his wife , Phillip would never have dared such a familiarity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I worked with him for over twenty years , but I never knew him . Lillian , he " Phillip had to take a few breaths , then he picked up my hand and held it in his . " He left you nothing . He willed everything to his brother and sister . " I could n't understand what he meant . " But he hates them , " I said , pulling my hand from his grasp . Atlanta and Ray were Jimmie 's only living relatives , and Jimmie despised them . He took care of them financially , always bailing one or the other of them out of some mess , but he detested them . No , worse , he had contempt for them . One time Jimmie was looking at me strangely , and I asked what was going on in his mind . " They 'll eat you alive , " he said . " That sounds interesting , " I replied , smiling at him . But Jimmie did n't smile back . " When I die , Atlanta and Ray will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find lawyers to work on a contingency basis . " I did n't like what had become Jimmie 's frequent references to his demise . " Contingent upon what ? " I asked , still smiling . " How much money they get when they sue you to hell and back , " Jimmie said , frowning . I did n't want to hear any more , so I waved my hand in dismissal and said , " Phillip will take care of them . " " Phillip is no match for greed of that scale . " I had no reply for that , because I agreed with him . No matter how much Jimmie gave Atlanta and Ray , they wanted more . One time when Jimmie was called away unexpectedly , I found Atlanta in my closet , counting my shoes . She was n't the least embarrassed when I found her there . She looked up at me and said , " You have three more pairs than I do . " The look on her face frightened me so much that I turned and ran from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's left it all to them ? All what ? " I asked Phillip . I wanted to think about anything other than what my life was going to be like without Jimmie . " I mean that James willed all his stocks , his houses , real estate around the world , the airlines , all of it to your brother and sister-in-law . " Since I hated each and every one of the houses that Jimmie had purchased , I could n't comprehend what was so bad about this . " Too much glass and steel for my taste , " I said , giving Phillip a bit of a smile . Phillip glared at me . " Lillian , this is serious , and James is no longer here to protect you and I do n't have the power to do anything . I do n't know why he did it , Lord knows I tried to talk him out of it , but he said that he was giving you what you needed . That 's all I could get out of him . " Phillip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm . Jimmie said that what he liked about Phillip was that nothing on earth could upset him . But this had . I tried to get the picture of my future out of my head , tried to stop thinking about a life without Jimmie 's laughter and his big shoulders to protect me , and looked up at Phillip expectantly . " Are you saying that I 'm destitute ? " I tried not to smile . The jewelry that Jimmie had given me over the years was worth millions . Phillip took a deep breath . " More or less . He 's left you a farm in Virginia . " " There , then , that 's something , " I said , then I took the humor out of my voice and waited for him to continue . " It was a breach of ethics , but after I wrote the will for him , I sent someone down to Virginia to look at the place . It 's ... not much . It 's " He turned away for a moment , and I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't want to hear that , so I ignored him . When he turned back to me , his face was businesslike . He looked at his watch , a watch that I knew Jimmie had given him ; it cost over twenty thousand dollars . I owned a smaller version of it . " Did you do anything to him ? " Phillip asked softly . " Another man maybe ? " I could n't stop my little snort of derision , and my answer was just to look at Phillip . Women in harems were n't kept under tighter lock and key than James Manville 's wife . " All right , " Phillip said , " I 've had months to try to figure this out , and I have n't come close , so I 'm going to give up . When James 's will is read , all hell is going to break loose . Atlanta and Ray are going to get it all , and what you get is a farmhouse in Virginia and fifty grand -a pittance . " He narrowed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do is see that you receive as much as you and I can buy between now and the moment that James 's death is announced to the public . " It was hearing those words , " James 's death , " that almost did me in . " No , you do n't , " Phillip said as he grabbed my arm and pulled me upright . " You do n't have time for grief or self-pity right now . You have to get dressed . The store manager is waiting . " At five-thirty on that cold spring morning , I was pushed inside a huge department store and told that I was to buy what I needed for a farmhouse in Virginia . Phillip said the man he sent could n't see inside the house , so I did n't even know how many bedrooms it had . The sleepy store manager who 'd been roused from bed to open the store for James Manville 's wife dutifully followed Phillip and me about and noted down what I pointed at . It all seemed so unreal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a part of me , the still-in-shock part , could n't wait to tell Jimmie this story . How he 'd laugh at it ! I 'd exaggerate every moment of it , and the more he 'd laugh , the more flamboyant my story would become . " So there I was , half asleep , being asked which couch I wanted to buy , " I 'd say . " ' Couch ? ' the little man asked , yawning . ' What 's a couch ? ' " But there was not going to be any storytelling with Jimmie , for I was never going to see Jimmie alive again . I did as I was told , though , and I chose furniture , cookware , linens , and even appliances for a house that I had never seen . But it all seemed so ridiculous . Jimmie had houses full of furniture , most of it custom-made , and there were great , enormous kitchens full of every imaginable piece of cooking gear . At seven , when Phillip was driving me back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picked up a brochure . " I bought you a car , " he said , handing me a glossy photo of a four-wheel-drive Toyota . I was beginning to wake up , and I was beginning to feel pain . Everything seemed so odd ; my world was turning upside down . Why was Phillip driving a car himself ? He usually used one of Jimmie 's cars and a driver . " You ca n't take the jewelry , " Phillip was saying . " Each piece has been itemized and insured . You may take your clothing , but even at that I think that Atlanta may give you some problems . She 's your size . " " My size , " I whispered . " Take my clothes . " " You can fight it all , of course , " Phillip was saying . " But something 's wrong . About six months ago , Atlanta hinted that she knew some big secret about you . " Phillip looked at me out of the corner of his eye . I knew he was again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when ? I wondered . Jimmie did n't like to be alone , not even for a second , and he made sure I was never alone . " ' Fraid the bogeyman will get me , " he said , kissing my nose , when I asked him why he avoided solitude so diligently . Jimmie rarely no , Jimmie never gave straight answers to personal questions . He lived in the here and now ; he lived in the world around him , not inside his head . He was n't one for pondering why people were the way they were ; he accepted them , and liked them or did n't . " I was a virgin when I met him , " I said softly to Phillip , " and there 's only been Jimmie . " But I looked away when I said it , for I knew that there was a secret between Jimmie and me . Only I knew it , though . Atlanta could n't know could she ? But she did . By eight , my comfortable , safe world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how Atlanta heard about Jimmie 's plane going down so soon after it happened , but she had . And in the time between when Atlanta was told and the press heard of Jimmie 's death , she had accomplished more than in all the other forty-eight years of her life combined . When Phillip and I returned from our crazy shopping expedition , we were greeted at the front door of what I 'd thought of as my house by men carrying guns , and I was also told I was n't allowed to enter . I was told that , as Jimmie 's only surviving relatives , Atlanta and Ray now owned everything . When Phillip and I got back into the car , he was shaking his head in wonder . " How did they find out about the will ? How did she know James left it all to them ? Look , Lillian , " he said , and I noted that up until Jimmie 's death , he 'd always called me Mrs. Manville , " I do n't know how she found out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... and ... " Obviously , he could n't think of anything horrible enough to do to someone on his staff who 'd leaked the contents of Jimmie 's will . " We 'll fight this . You 're his wife , and you have been for many years . You and I will " " I was seventeen when I married him , " I said quietly . " And I did n't have my mother 's permission . " " Oh , my God , " Phillip said , then he opened his mouth to begin what I assumed was going to be a lecture on my irresponsibility . But he closed it again , and rightfully so . What good would it do to lecture me now that Jimmie was gone ? The next weeks were horrible beyond anything I 'd ever imagined . Atlanta was on TV just hours after Jimmie 's death , telling the press that she was going to fight " that woman " who had so enslaved her beloved brother for all those years . " I 'm going to see that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Atlanta that Jimmie 's will stated I was to get nothing . Not even the farmhouse was mentioned in the will . No , Atlanta was out to avenge all the things she imagined I 'd done to her over the years . She did n't just want money ; she wanted me humiliated . Yes , of course she 'd found out that my marriage to Jimmie had n't been legal . It could n't have been difficult . My sister knew . She and her husband had divorced because she could n't bear to stay in Morocco , but her husband called Atlanta and volunteered the information that I was n't legally married to Jimmie . However she found out , Atlanta waved my birth certificate before the press , then showed them the photocopy of my marriage certificate . I was only seventeen when we 'd married , but I 'd lied and said that I was eighteen , and therefore legally in charge of my own fate . No longer did I have Jimmie to protect me from the press . Now every reporter who 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his archives and pulled out the most unflattering photos of me he could find , then slapped them across every communications media there was . I could n't look at TV , a magazine , or a computer screen that did n't feature all my chins and the nose I 'd inherited from my father . I 'd told Jimmie about a thousand times that I wanted to have my overlarge nose " fixed . " " Removed ! " is what I said , but Jimmie always told me that he loved me as I was , and , eventually , the right hook of my nose did n't seem to matter . When I heard what was being said about me , my ugly nose was the least of my concerns . How can I describe what it felt like to see four respected journalists three men and a woman sitting around a table , discussing whether or not I had " trapped " James Manville into marrying me ? As though a man like Jimmie could be trapped by anyone ! And by a seventeen-year-old girl whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won at the state fair ? Not likely . Lawyers talked about whether or not I was legally entitled to any of Jimmie 's money . But when the will was finally read and it was seen that Jimmie had given it all to his brother and sister , I was suddenly the Jezebel of America . Everyone seemed to believe that I had somehow ensnared dear little Jimmie ( the youthful Salome was the comparison used most often ) but that he had found out about it and had used his will to give me " what I deserved . " Phillip did his best to keep me away from the press , but it was n't easy . I wanted to get on a plane and go away , to hide from everything but that was no longer an option . My days of jumping on a plane and going anywhere in the world I wanted were over . For six weeks after Jimmie 's death , while the courts dealt with his will and the press hashed and rehashed everything they heard , I stayed locked inside Phillip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those horrible weeks was when I went to Jimmie 's funeral , and then I was so shrouded in black draperies that I may as well not have been there . And I most certainly was n't going to give the press or Atlanta and Ray the satisfaction of seeing me weep . When I got to the church , I was told that I could n't enter , but Phillip had anticipated such an event , and seemingly out of nowhere , half a dozen men the size of sumo wrestlers appeared and surrounded me . That 's how I entered Jimmie 's funeral : walking in the midst of six enormous men , my face and body covered with black cloth . It was all right , though , because by that time I had realized that Jimmie was actually never coming back , and nothing anyone did mattered much . And , too , I kept imagining that farmhouse he 'd left me . One time Jimmie had asked me to describe where I 'd like to live , and I 'd talked of a cozy little house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a lake nearby . " I 'll see what I can do , " he 'd said , smiling at me with twinkling eyes . But the next house he 'd bought was a castle on an island off the coast of Scotland , and the thing was so cold that even in August my teeth were chattering . After the will was probated , I made no move to leave Phillip 's house . With the press still hovering outside and with Jimmie gone , it did n't seem to matter where I was or what I did . I took long showers , and I sat at the table with Phillip and his family his wife , Carol , and their two young daughters but I do n't remember eating anything . It was Phillip who told me that it was time for me to leave . " I ca n't go out there , " I said in fear , glancing toward the curtains that I kept drawn night and day . " They 're waiting for me . " Phillip took my hand in his and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I no longer had a husband , I still felt married . I snatched my hand away and frowned at him . But Phillip smiled . " Carol and I have been talking , and we think you should ... well , that you should disappear . " " Ah , yes , " I said , " suttee . The wife climbs onto the funeral pyre and follows her husband into the afterlife . " From the look on Phillip 's face , he did n't appreciate my black sense of humor . Jimmie had . Jimmie used to say that the more depressed I was , the funnier I was . If that was so , I should have gone onstage the day of his funeral . " Lillian , " Phillip said , but when he reached toward my hand again , I withdrew it . " Have you looked at yourself lately ? " " I " I began , intending to make a sarcastic remark , but then I glanced into the mirror over the big dresser across from the bed in the guest room in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed that I 'd lost some weight . Not eating for weeks on end will do that . But I had n't noticed how much I 'd lost . My chins were gone . I had cheekbones . I looked back at Phillip . " Amazing , is n't it ? All those diet programs that Jimmie paid for for me , and all he had to do was die and bingo ! I 'm finally slim . " Phillip frowned again . " Lillian , I 've waited until now to talk to you . I 've tried to give you some time to come to terms with James 's death and his will . " He started on another lecture about my stupidity in not telling either him or Jimmie that I 'd been seventeen when we married . " He would have given you a huge wedding . He would have loved doing that for you , " Phillip had said the day after he found out . " It would have been so much better than the elopement you had the first time . " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear it again , so I cut him off . " You want me to disappear ? " " Actually , it was Carol 's idea . She said that as things stand now , the rest of your life is going to be one long press interview . People are going to hound you forever to tell them about your life with Jimmie . Unless " " Unless what ? " I asked . Phillip 's thin face lit up , and for a moment I saw the " little fox " that Jimmie had always said the man was . " Do you remember when I told you that I 'd tried to talk James out of writing his will as he did ? " He did n't wait for me to answer . " I did persuade him not to put the farmhouse in the will . I said that if he was so afraid of what his sister would do , then she 'd probably try to take the farm too . At that time I had n't seen the place , and I thought it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valuable , " he said softly , looking down at the floor for a moment , then back up at me . " Look , Lillian , I know the farmhouse is n't much , but it must have meant something to James , or he would n't have kept it all these years . " " Why did he buy it in the first place ? " " That 's just it , he did n't buy it . I think he 's always owned it . " " People have to buy things , " I said , confused . " People just do n't give real estate away , at least not while they 're alive . " It was then that understanding began to hit me . " You mean you think that Jimmie might have inherited this farm ? " For the first time , I felt some interest spark inside me . All three of them , Atlanta , Ray , and Jimmie , were maddeningly secretive about their childhood . When questioned , Ray evaded and changed the subject . Atlanta and Jimmie out-and-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dakota one day , and in Louisiana the next . I knew for a fact that Jimmie had given me four different names for his mother . I 'd even secretly read all six of the biographies that had been written about him , but the authors had had no better luck than I had in finding out anything about the first sixteen years of James Manville 's life . " I do n't know for sure , " Phillip said , " but I do know that James did n't buy the place since I 've known him . " At that statement , all I could do was blink . Jimmie and Phillip had been together from the beginning . " When I said that Atlanta and Ray might try to take the farm away from you , all I can tell you is that James turned white , as though he were afraid of something . " " Jimmie afraid ? " I said , unable to grasp that concept . " He said , ' You 're right , Phil , so I 'm going to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I want you to sign it over to Lil . And I want you to give her this from me . ' " That was when Phillip handed me the note written by Jimmie . It was in a sealed envelope , so Phillip had n't read it . He 'd kept it and the deed to the farm in Virginia in his home safe , awaiting the day when he 'd turn them both over to me . After I read the note , I folded it and put it back into the envelope . I did n't cry ; I 'd cried so much over the last six weeks that I did n't seem to have any more liquid inside me . I reached for the deed to the farm , but Phillip pulled it back . " If I make this out to Lillian Manville , then register the property transfer , within twenty-four hours , you 'll have reporters and lawyers on your doorstep . But " he said , drawing out what he wanted to say as though I were a child he was enticing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but just stared at him . " All right , " he said at last . " What Carol and I thought was that maybe you should change your identity . You 've lost so much weight that you do n't look like James Manville 's fat little wife anymore . " That remark made me narrow my eyes at him . I did not want to hear what he and the rest of Jimmie 's staff had sniggered behind his back . I guess I 'd not spent all those years near Jimmie for nothing , because I could see Phillip beginning to wither under my gaze . " All right , " he said again , then let out his pent-up breath . " It 's up to you , but I 've already done a lot of the work , such as get you new documents of identification . I needed to use James 's connections while they still remembered him . Sorry to be so blunt , but people forget fast . Now , it 's up to you to accept it . " He handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no photo inside , but there was a name .

" The problem was that I did like the idea . A new name ; maybe a new life . " Carol thought that with your weight loss , and if you got your hair cut and lightened , and if you ... Well , if you ... " I looked at him . What was he having such a hard time saying ? But then I saw that he had his eyes fixed on my nose . I 'd gone down headfirst on a playground slide in the first grade and had managed to knock my nose permanently to the right . " No wonder , " sixth-grade Johnnie Miller had said as I stood there gushing blood . " Her nose is so big that it hit the ground half an hour before she did . " I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she tried hard not to laugh , even as she made Johnnie apologize for his remark . " You want me to get a nose job , " I said flatly . Phillip gave a curt nod . Turning , I looked at myself in the mirror . If Jimmie had left me his billions , I could have made a prison with high fences and locked myself away from all the gigolos and hangers-on that orbit around money . I did n't have the billions , but I did have the notoriety . I knew that , eventually , in ten years or so , Jimmie would fade in people 's memories and I 'd be left alone , but during those ten years ... I looked back at Phillip . " It 's my guess that you have a surgeon all set up . " " Tonight . " He looked at his watch , the twenty-thousand-dollar one that Jimmie had given him ; Atlanta was now wearing mine . " If you 're ready , that is . " I took a deep breath . " As ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , then stood up . That was two weeks ago . My nose had healed enough that I knew it was time to step outside Phillip and Carol 's big house . It was n't Lillian Manville who was to greet the world , but someone I did n't even recognize in the mirror , someone named Bailey James . During the time I was recovering from surgery , I 'd come to know Carol somewhat better . In the past she 'd attended the parties that Jimmie liked to give , but he had always warned me that it was better not to get too chummy with employees , so I was courteous , but there were no secrets shared between us . I did n't share secrets with anyone other than Jimmie . The surgery had been done in the doctor 's office , and a few hours later I was driven back to Carol and Phillip 's house . The first night a nurse stayed with me , but the second night I was alone when Carol tapped on my door . When I answered , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Are you angry ? " she asked . " No , the doctor did a fine job . Nothing to be angry about , " I answered , pretending that I did n't know what she was talking about . She did n't fall for it ; she stared hard at me . " You mean , am I angry that I spent sixteen years giving my entire life to a man , only to be cut out of his will ? " Carol smiled at my sarcasm . " Men are slime , " she said , then we smiled together , and when I touched my sore nose in pain , we laughed . It was my first genuine feeling of humor since I 'd last talked to Jimmie . " So what are you going to wear ? " Carol asked , folding her legs and sitting on the corner of the bed . She was about ten years older than me , and I 'd be willing to bet that she was no stranger to the surgeon 's knife . She was blonde and pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that meant because I , too , used to spend a lot of my time looking after myself . I may have been plump , but I was a well-coiffed , well-tended plump . " Wear where ? " I asked , and felt my heart jump a bit . Please , I silently prayed , someone tell me that I was n't going to have to go again to some courtroom and hear Atlanta and Ray accuse me of " controlling " Jimmie . " On your new body , " Carol said . " You ca n't keep on wearing my sweats , you know . " " Oh , " I said . " Sorry . I guess I have n't thought much about clothes lately . I " Damnation , but tears were coming to my eyes . I wanted to be the brave little soldier and believe that , whatever Jimmie had done had been done out of love . But when I was confronted with issues such as the fact that the only clothing I now owned was what I 'd put on the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given me , I did n't feel very brave . Carol reached out to touch my hand , but then she pulled back and moved off the bed . " I 'll be back in just a minute , " she said as she left the room . In seconds she returned with a foot-high stack of what looked like catalogs . She 'd taken so little time to get them , I knew she must have had them piled outside . She spread them across the bottom of the bed , and I looked at them in wonder . " What are these ? " " Phillip owes me five bucks ! " she said in triumph . " I bet him you 'd never seen a catalog . In nor uh , most households , catalogs come through the mail at the rate of about six a day . " I knew she 'd been about to say " in normal households , " but she 'd stopped herself . In Jimmie 's houses , a servant brought me my few pieces of mail on a silver dish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inside were the kind of clothes that appeared in my closet now and then , especially in the two island houses . Jimmie had someone he called a " shopper " who made sure that we had whatever clothes we needed in every house . Carol picked up a catalog and flipped through it . The cover read " Coldwater Creek . " " You know , I used to feel sorry for you . You always looked so alone and lost . I told Phillip that " Breaking off , she bent down toward the catalog . " You told him what ? " " That you were like a lightbulb , and you were only on when James was around . " I did n't like what she 'd said . Not one bit . It made me sound so ... so nothing , as though I were n't a person at all . " So what did you have in mind with these ? " I asked , making my voice sound as cool as possible . She understood my tone . " It 's my opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave Phillip and me , so I thought we might order you some new clothes and whatever else you might need in your new life . We 'll charge it all to Phillip ; he can afford it . " She lowered her voice . " He 's going to be one of the attorneys for Atlanta and Ray . " At that my mouth dropped open , then I winced because my new , smaller nose hurt at the movement . I wanted to scream , " The traitor ! " but I did n't . " Remind me . What did Jimmie and I give you for your wedding ? " " This house , " Carol said . For a moment I could n't speak , and I had to look away so she would n't see my eyes . He gave a house to his attorney , a man he thought was his friend , but now that so-called friend was going to work for the enemy . I picked up a catalog . " Do you have one of these things for jewelry ? I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I smiled back ; a friendship was formed .
