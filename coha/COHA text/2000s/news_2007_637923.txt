<p> For Brent Lomas and thousands of other college students , the official end of childhood comes Friday night at midnight . <p> Once he 's read " Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , " " I have to go out into the world and say goodbye , " says the college senior , only half-joking . " It 's the kind of thing that defines your childhood . I spent my teen years always being excited about the next book , and now that 's over ... It 's like letting go of a friend or a family member . " <p> J.K. Rowling might have created the boy wizard , but the fans who were contemporaries of Harry , Ron , and Hermione while the series was written say they own the books in a way that no other generation ever will . " He belongs to us , " says Andrea Farrer , a senior at Hackett Catholic Central High School in Kalamazoo . " Harry grew up with us . " " It 's the defining thing of our decade . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her friend Kaili Doud , who plans to dress up as Winky , the house elf , for the final midnight party at Barnes and Noble here in Kalamazoo . While it would be going too far to call them the " Harry Potter generation , " a number of Gen-Y fans think that they and their peers will be tied to Harry in cultural memory the same way that boomers have the Beatles and Woodstock and Gen-Xers have " Star Wars . " And frankly , some of them say , they could do a lot worse . <p> " When you think about what kids look at these days to teach them about the world - Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie - I think it 's very interesting that this fantasy character and fantasy series have been able to teach us morals and lessons about the world , " says Mr. Lomas , who cites among those lessons acceptance of others and the importance of looking within yourself for strength .

" " I hope people identify us with Harry Potter over Bratz dolls and celebrity obsession . I hope they think of us embracing a creative idea . " <p> With 325 million copies sold so far , plus movies , video games , websites , tribute bands , and a planned theme park , " embracing " is putting it mildly . Indeed , " rabid fandom " may be too tame a term . Certainly , adolescents have always at least partly identified themselves by the pop culture they consume - whether it 's Elvis or emo ( sad , mopey rock music , usually sung by pale young men with droopy bangs ) - and sought a fellowship of like-minded fans . " That 's what our age group does , " shrugs Kalamazoo high school senior Katie McAtee , who belongs to the Facebook group " Please Do n't Bother Me on July 21 " - the date of the book 's release . <p> The Internet obviously has made building connections much easier ( and given people a way to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't explain the sheer size of Pottermania . So , of course , experts have stepped into the breach . <p> " Harry 's the herald who offers a moral code in times of great upheaval that vibrates to this generation the way the early Bob Dylan still echoes in the lives of boomers , " argued Joel Garreau in an opinion article in The Washington Post in 2005 , just prior to the publication of Book 6 . " He is the prophet and precursor of a new generation . " <p> Other analysts think Potter as generational messiah might be overstating things a tad . " I think they 're reaching , " says Anne Alton , professor of English at Central Michigan University in Mount Pleasant who taught a course on " Harry Potter " last semester . " That 's not to negate how much fun Harry Potter has been . " <p> Not surprisingly , the importance Gen Yers place on Harry as a lasting icon tends to follow in lock step with how many times they 've reread the series . Certainly , students who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hogwarts for moral guidance . And despite the media frenzy in anticipation of Book 7 , not every US college student spent her youth in thrall to Rowling 's spell . <p> " It 's not a cultural touchstone for me , " says Jen Siegel , who 's studying accounting at the State University of New York in Albany . Given recent world events such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks , the war in Iraq , and global warming , she 's not sure Harry Potter will make it into the history books as a defining event of a generation . " There 's a lot going on , " she says . <p> Even some fans think that 's a lot of weight to put on a series that they say basically boils down to the archetypal showdown of good versus evil . <p> " I would n't say it has affected my worldview , but it 's an amazingly catchy story , " says Matt Trevithick , a senior at Boston University and an early adopter whose mom ordered the first book from England a year before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the characters , " says Ainsley Brockmeyer , a sociology major from Norwood , Mass. , who can recite precisely how many times she 's read each book and credits the series with helping her develop a love of reading as a teen . While she loves the way the books can transport her to the world of Hogwarts , she and others say that going through the trials of adolescence at the same time that Harry did created a deeper connection with the characters . <p> " Having the books written before them , watching the series as it has unfolded - that 's added a lot to that connection : Not only do n't I know what 's going to come next , but NO ONE knows what 's going to come next , " says Professor Alton . To her , the years of shared anticipation and speculation are what makes the phenomenon unique to this generation of readers , rather than the thematic material . " Readers coming to this in five or 10 years ' time - or even next year - will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shamban is inclined to agree . " The books might be just as meaningful to new generations of children , but it wo n't be such a cultural experience for them , " says the Stanford University senior . He argues that his generation has struggled with apathy . " If we can show that we really cared about something , that we allowed ourselves to unify around one thing ... why not Harry Potter ? For a children 's book , it 's really tied into contemporary , grown-up problems . It 's about alienation and identity and how we cope with great tragedy . It speaks to ... terrorism and all these things going on . " <p> Alton counters that the " The Lord of the Rings " swarmed college campuses in the 1960s in a similar way , and says that , until the final chapter has been read , the verdict is still out on what Potter 's lasting legacy will be . <p> As for Lomas , he plans to stretch out his last hours with his childhood companion : " Instead of reading it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
