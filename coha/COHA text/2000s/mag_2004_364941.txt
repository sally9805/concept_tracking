A couple of cozy new Major League Baseball parks make good reasons to take the family on the road this summer . Citizens Bank Park , right , in Philadelphia features a skyline view beyond center field , a promenade where Geno 's and Tony Luke 's offer their famous cheesesteaks , and the Phanatic Kid 's Corner , where children can dress their own mini-version of the Phillies mascot . With a sandbox behind the outfield wall , San Diego 's Petco Park is also kid friendly . Trolley rides to the waterfront park and the old brick warehouse in left field are among Petco 's other charms . The downside : the San Diego Chicken , the team 's beloved mascot , is n't coming out of retirement . The Padres Friar will have to do .  --  By Sean Gregory
