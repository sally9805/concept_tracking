Tarboy <br> 1 Vaqrin ( first day of summer ) 941 <br> Midnight <br> It began , as every disaster in his life began , with a calm . The harbor and the village slept . The wind that had roared all night lay quelled by the headland ; the bosun grew too sleepy to shout . But forty feet up the ratlines , Pazel Pathkendle had never been more awake . <br> He was freezing , to start with  --  a rogue wave had struck the bow at dusk , soaking eight boys and washing the ship 's dog into the hold , where it still yipped for rescue  --  but it was n't the cold that worried him . It was the storm cloud . It had leaped the coastal ridge in one bound , on high winds he could n't feel . The ship had no reason to fear it , but Pazel did . People were trying to kill him , and the only thing stopping them was the moon , that blessed bonfire moon , etching his shadow like a coal drawing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought . Then it can pour for all I care . <br> While the calm held , the Eniel ran quiet as a dream : her captain hated needless bellowing , calling it the poor pilot 's surrogate for leadership , and merely gestured to the afterguard when the time came to tack for shore . Glancing up at the mainsails , his eyes fell on Pazel , and for a moment they regarded each other in silence : an old man stiff and wrinkled as a cypress ; a boy in tattered shirt and breeches , nut-brown hair in his eyes , clinging barefoot to the tarred and salt-stiffened ropes . A boy suddenly aware that he had no permission to climb aloft . <br> Pazel made a show of checking the yardarm bolts , and the knots on the closest stays . The captain watched his antics , unmoved . Then , almost invisibly , he shook his head . <br> Pazel slid to the deck in an instant , furious with himself . You clod , Pathkendle ! Lose Nestef 's love and there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the five mariners he had served : the only one who never beat or starved him , or forced him , a boy of fifteen , to drink the black nightmare liquor grebel for the amusement of the crew . If Nestef had ordered him to dive into the sea , Pazel would have obeyed at once . He was a bonded servant and could be traded like a slave . <br> On the deck , the other servant boys  --  tarboys , they were called , for the pitch that stained their hands and feet  --  turned him looks of contempt . They were older and larger , with noses proudly disfigured from brawls of honor in distant ports . The eldest , Jervik , sported a hole in his right ear large enough to pass a finger through . Rumor held that a violent captain had caught him stealing a pudding , and had pinched the ear with tongs heated cherry-red in the galley stove . <br> The other rumor attached to Jervik was that he had stabbed a boy in the neck after losing at darts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he knew that a gleam came to Jervik 's eyes at the first sign of another 's weakness , and he knew the boy carried a knife . <br> One of Jervik 's hangers-on gestured at Pazel with his chin . " Thinks his place is on the maintop , this one , " he said , grinning . " Bet you can tell him diff'rint , eh , Jervik ? " <br> " Shut up , Nat , you ai n't clever , " said Jervik , his eyes locked on Pazel . <br> " What ho , Pazel Pathkendle , he 's defendin ' you , " laughed another . " Ai n't you goin ' to thank him ? You better thank him ! " <br> Jervik turned the speaker a cold look . The laughter ceased . " I ha n't defended no one , " said the larger boy . <br> " ? ' Course you did n't , Jervik , I just  --  " <br> " Somebody worries my mates , I defend them . Defend my good name , too . But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <br> The laughter was general , now : Jervik had given permission . <br> Then Pazel said , " Your mates and your good name . How about your honor , Jervik , and your word ? " <br> " Them too , " snapped Jervik . <br> " And wet fire ? " <br> " Eh ? " <br> " Diving roosters ? Four-legged ducks ? " <br> Jervik stared at Pazel for a moment . Then he glided over and hit him squarely on the cheek . <br> " Brilliant reply , Jervik , " said Pazel , standing his ground despite the fire along one side of his face . <br> Jervik raised a corner of his shirt . Tucked into his breeches was a skipper 's knife with a fine , well-worn leather grip . <br> " Want another sort of reply , do you ? " <br> His face was inches from Pazel 's own . His lips were stained red by low-grade sapwort ; his eyes had a yellow tinge . <br> " I want my knife back , " said Pazel . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mine ! " <br> " That knife was my father 's . You 're a thief , and you do n't dare use it . " <br> Jervik hit him again , harder . " Put up your fists , Muketch , " he said . <br> Pazel did not raise his fists . Snickering , Jervik and the others went about their duties , leaving Pazel blinking with pain and rage . <br> By the Sailing Code that governed all ships , Captain Nestef would have no choice but to dismiss a tarboy caught fighting . Jervik could risk it : he was a citizen of Arqual , this great empire sprawling over a third of the known world , and could always sign with another ship . More to the point , he wore a brass ring engraved with his Citizenship Number as recorded in the Imperial Boys ' Registry . Such rings cost a month 's wages , but they were worth it . Without the ring , any boy caught wandering in a seaside town could be taken for a bond-breaker or a foreigner . Few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certificates , and these were easily lost or stolen . <br> Pazel , however , was a bonded servant and a foreigner  --  even worse , a member of a conquered race . If his papers read Dismissed for Fighting , no other ship would have him . He would be cut adrift , waiting to be snatched up like a coin from the street , claimed as the finder 's property for the rest of his days . <br> Jervik knew this well , and seemed determined to goad Pazel into a fight . He called the younger boy Muketch after the mud crabs of Ormael , the home Pazel had not seen in five years . Ormael was once a great fortress-city , built on high cliffs over a blue and perfect harbor . A place of music and balconies and the smell of ripened plums , whose name meant " Womb of Morning "  --  but that city no longer existed . And it seemed to Pazel that nearly everyone would have preferred him to vanish along with it . His very presence on an Arquali ship was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain 's dress coat . After Jervik 's burst of inspiration , the other boys and even some of the sailors called him Muketch . But the word also conveyed a sort of wary respect : sailors thought a charm lay on those green crabs that swarmed in the Ormael marshes , and took pains not to step on them lest bad luck follow . <br> Superstition had not stopped Jervik and his gang from striking or tripping Pazel behind the captain 's back , however . And in the last week it had grown worse : they came at him in twos and threes , in lightless corners belowdecks , and with a viciousness he had never faced before . They may really kill me ( how could you think that and keep working , eating , breathing ? ) . They may try tonight . Jervik may drive them to it . <br> Pazel had won the last round : Jervik was indeed afraid to stab him in front of witnesses . But in the dark it was another matter : in the dark things were done in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jervik was a fool . He had a nasty sort of cunning , but his delight in abusing others made him careless . It was surely just a matter of time before Nestef dismissed him . Until then the trick was to avoid getting cornered . That was one reason Pazel had risked climbing aloft . The other was to see the Chathrand . <br> For tonight he would finally see her  --  the Chathrand , mightiest ship in all the world , with a mainmast so huge that three sailors could scarce link arms around it , and stern lamps tall as men , and square sails larger than the Queen 's Park in Etherhorde . She was being made ready for the open sea , some great trading voyage beyond the reach of Empire . Perhaps she would sail to Noonfirth , where men were black ; or the Outer Isles that faced the Ruling Sea ; or the Crownless Lands , wounded by war . Strangely , no one could tell him . But she was almost ready . <br> Pazel knew , for he had helped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many nights they had sailed up to Chathrand 's flank , here in the dark bay of Sorrophran . Both had been cloudy , moonless nights , and Pazel in any case had been kept busy in the hold until the moment of arrival . Emerging at last , he had seen only a black , bowed wall , furred with algae and snails and clams like snapped blades , and smelling of pitch and heartwood and the deep sea . Men 's voices floated down from above , and following them , a great boom lowered a platform to the Eniel 's deck . Onto this lift went sacks of rice and barley and hard winter wheat . Then boards , followed by crates of mandarins , barberries , figs , salt cod , salt venison , cokewood , coal ; and finally bundled cabbages , potatoes , yams , coils of garlic , wheels of rock-hard cheese . Food in breathtaking quantities : food for six months without landfall . Wherever the Great Ship was bound , she clearly had no wish to depend on local hospitality . <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise as if by magic . Some of the older boys grabbed at the ropes , laughing as they were whisked straight up , fifty feet , sixty , and swung over the distant rail . Returning on the emptied lift , they held bright pennies and sweetmeats , gifts from the unseen crew . Pazel cared nothing for these , but he was mad to see the deck of the Chathrand . <br> His life was ships , now : in the five years since Arqual swallowed his country , Pazel had spent less than two weeks ashore . The previous night , when the lift rose for the last time , caution had deserted him : he had seized a corner rope . Jervik had pried his fingers loose , sending him crashing back to the deck of the Eniel . <br> But tonight the little ship bore no cargo , just passengers : three quiet figures in seafarers ' cloaks , on this passage of a single night from Besq to Sorrophran . They kept apart from the crew , and even one another . Now , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these three pressed forward , seemingly as eager as Pazel himself for a glimpse of the legendary ship . <br> One of the three , to Pazel 's great excitement , was Dr. Ignus Chadfallow . He was a slender man with worried eyes and large , educated hands . An Imperial surgeon and scholar of note , Chadfallow had once saved the Emperor and his Horse Guard from the deadly talking fever by placing men and horses alike on a six-week diet of millet and prunes . He had also , single-handedly , saved Pazel from slavery . <br> The three passengers had boarded at sunset . Pazel and the other tarboys had shoved and shouldered one another at the rail , competing for the chance to lug footlockers aboard for a penny or two . Spotting Chadfallow , Pazel had leaped , waving , and nearly shouted Ignus ! But Chadfallow shot him a dark look , and the greeting died in his throat . <br> As Nestef welcomed his passengers , Pazel tried in vain to catch the doctor 's eye . When the cook shouted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other boys , for it was Nestef 's habit to greet new passengers with a mug of blistering spiced tea . But tonight there was more to the offerings : the cook loaded the tea-tray with muskberry biscuits , red ginger candies and lukka seeds to be chewed for warmth . Balancing these delicacies with great care , Pazel returned to the topdeck and walked straight to Chadfallow , his heart thumping in his chest . <br> " If you please , sir , " he said . <br> Chadfallow , his eyes on the moonwashed rocks and islets , seemed not to hear . Pazel spoke again , louder , and this time the doctor turned with a start . Pazel smiled uncertainly at his old benefactor . But Chadfallow 's voice was sharp . <br> " Where 's your breeding ? You 'll serve the duchess first . Go on ! " <br> Cheeks burning , Pazel turned away . The doctor 's coldness hurt him more than any blow from Jervik could . Not that it was altogether a surprise : Chadfallow often appeared frightened of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at length . But he was the closest thing to family Pazel had left in the world , and he had not laid eyes on him for two years . <br> Two years ! His hands , blast them , were trembling . He had to swallow hard before he spoke to the duchess . At least , he hoped she was the duchess , a bent and ancient woman three inches shorter than Pazel himself , who stood by the foremast mumbling and worrying the gold rings on her fingers . When Pazel spoke she raised her head and fixed him with her gaze . Her eyes were large and milky blue , and as she stared at him , her dry lips twisted into a smile . <br> " Ehiji ! " <br> Her crooked hand shot out ; a nail scraped his cheek . He had shed tears . The crone put her moistened finger to her lips and grinned all the wider . Then she fell upon the tea service . First she popped the three largest ginger candies into her mouth , and slid a fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorched pipe from the folds of her cloak . As Pazel watched , aghast , she tapped the half-burned plug of tobacco into the bowl of lukka seeds , stirred with a thumb and then crushed the whole mixture back into her pipe , whispering and squeaking to herself all the while . Her eyes found Pazel 's again . <br> " Got a flint ? " <br> " No , ma'am , " said Pazel . <br> " That 's Lady Oggosk to you ! Fetch a lamp , then . " <br> It was difficult to fetch anything while holding the tea-tray . Pazel thought his arms would break , hoisting a brass deck lamp heavy with walrus oil as Lady Oggosk struggled with her pipe . Wafts of burning walrus , tobacco and lukka seeds flooded his nostrils , and the Lady 's breath as she puffed and hiccuped was like a draft from a ginger-scented tomb . At last the pipe lit , and she cackled . <br> " Do n't cry , my little monkey . He has n't forgotten you  --  oh , not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She could only mean Chadfallow , but what did she know of their connection ? Before he could find a way to ask , she turned from him , still chuckling to herself . <br> The third passenger was a merchant , well groomed and well fed . At first glance , Pazel thought him ill : he had a white scarf wrapped tight about his neck , and one hand rested there as if nursing a sore spot . He cleared his throat with a painful noise  --  CHHRCK !  --  nearly making Pazel spill the tea . The man had an appetite , too : four biscuits vanished into his mouth , followed by the next largest ginger candy . <br> " You 're not very clean , " he said suddenly , looking Pazel up and down . " Whose soap do you use ? " <br> " Whose soap , sir ? " <br> " Is that a difficult question ? Who makes the soap you scrub your face with ? " <br> " We 're given potash , sir . " <br> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer , sir , " said Pazel . " Captain Nestef has extended me his hand of friendship , for which I bless him thrice over . He says I have genuine prospects , with my flair for languages , and  --  " <br> " My own prospects are excellent , of course , " the man informed him . " My name is Ket  --  a name worth remembering , worth jotting down . I am about to make transactions valued at sixty thousand gold cockles . And that is just one trading voyage . " <br> " How grand for you , sir . I say , sir ! Would you be sailing on the Chathrand ? " <br> " You will not see sixty thousand in your lifetime  --  nor even six . Go now . " <br> He placed something on the tea-tray and waved Pazel off . Pazel bowed and withdrew , then looked at the object . It was a pale green disc , stamped with the words ket soap . <br> One of those sixty thousand coins would have suited him better , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked at the tray and his heart sank . He had nothing left for Chadfallow but a small rind of ginger and a broken biscuit . <br> The doctor ignored these , but pointed at the tea flask . Carefully , Pazel filled a mug . The doctor wrapped his long fingers around it , raised it to his lips and inhaled the steam , as he had told Pazel one should in cold weather , to " vivify the nostrils . " He did not look at the boy , and Pazel did not know whether to stay or leave . At last , very softly , the doctor spoke . <br> " You 're not ill ? " <br> " No , " said Pazel . <br> " Your mind-fits ? " <br> " They 're cured , " said Pazel quickly , very glad they were alone . No one on the Eniel knew about his mind-fits . <br> " Cured ? " said the doctor . " How did you manage that ? " <br> Pazel shrugged . " I bought some medicine in Sorhn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <br> " Everyone does not live under the influence of magic spells , " said Chadfallow . " And how much did they charge you for this . . . medicine ? " <br> " They took . . . what I had , " admitted Pazel , frowning . " But it was worth every penny . I 'd do it again tomorrow . " <br> Chadfallow sighed . " I dare say you would . Now what about your teeth ? " <br> Pazel looked up , startled by the quick change of focus : his mind-fits were the doctor 's favorite subject . " My teeth are just fine , " he said carefully . <br> " That 's good . But this tea is not . Taste it . " <br> Chadfallow passed him the cup , and watched as he drank . <br> Pazel grimaced . " It 's bitter , " he said . <br> " More bitter for you than me . Or so you may well imagine . " <br> " What do you mean by that ? " Pazel 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd ? " <br> But like the duchess and the soap man , Chadfallow merely turned to face the sea . And all through that night 's crossing he showed no more interest in Pazel than in the common sailors who bustled around him . <br> Continues ...
