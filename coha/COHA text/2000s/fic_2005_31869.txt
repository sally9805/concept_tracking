Before the Communists came to power in 1949 , I was a sophomore at the Huangpu Military Academy , majoring in political education . The school , at that time based in Chengdu , the capital of Szechuan Province , had played a vital part in the Nationalist regime . Chiang Kai-shek had once been its principal , and many of his generals had graduated from it . In some ways , the role of the Huangpu in the Nationalist army was like that of West Point in the American military . The cadets at the Huangpu had been disgusted with the corruption of the Nationalists , so they readily surrendered to the People 's Liberation Army when the Communists arrived . The new government disbanded our academy and turned it into a part of the Southwestern University of Military and Political Sciences . We were encouraged to continue our studies and prepare ourselves to serve the new China . The Communists promised to treat us fairly , without any discrimination . Unlike most of my fellow students who specialized in military science , however , I dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses I had taken in the old academy were of no use to the People 's Liberation Army . I was more likely to be viewed as a backward case , if not a reactionary . At the university , established mainly for reindoctrinating the former Nationalist officers and cadets , we were taught the basic ideas of Marx , Lenin , Stalin , and Mao Zedong , and we had to write out our personal histories , confess our wrongdoings , and engage in self- and mutual criticism . A few stubborn officers from the old army would n't relinquish their former outlook and were punished in the reeducation program-they were imprisoned in a small house at thenortheastern corner of our campus . But since I had never resisted the Communists , I felt relatively safe . I did n't learn much in the new school except for some principles of the proletarian revolution . At graduation the next fall , I was assigned to the 180th Division of the People 's Liberation Army , a unit noted for its battle achievements in the war against the Japanese invaders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started as a junior officer at its headquarters garrisoned in Chengdu City , where my mother was living . My father had passed away three years before , and my assignment would enable me to take care of my mother . Besides , I had just become engaged to a girl , a student of fine arts at Szechuan Teachers College , majoring in choreography . Her name was Tao Julan , and she lived in the same city . We planned to get married the next year , preferably in the fall after she graduated . In every direction I turned , life seemed to smile upon me . It was as if all the shadows were lifting . The Communists had brought order to our country and hope to the common people . I had never been so cheerful . Three times a week I had to attend political study sessions . We read and discussed documents issued by the Central Committee and writings by Stalin and Chairman Mao , such as The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , On the People 's Democratic Dictatorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our division was composed of men from the Nationalist army , including hundreds of officers , the study sessions felt like a formality and did n't bother me much . The commissar of the Eighteenth Army Group , Hu Yaobang , who thirty years later became the Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party , even declared at a meeting that our division would never leave Szechuan and that from now on we must devote ourselves to rebuilding our country . I felt grateful to the Communists , who seemed finally to have brought peace to our war-battered land . Then the situation changed . Three weeks before the Spring Festival of 1951 , we received orders to move to Hebei , a barren province adjacent to Manchuria , where we would prepare to enter Korea . This came as a surprise , because we were a poorly equipped division and the Korean War had been so far away that we had n't expected to participate . I wanted to have a photograph taken with my fiance before I departed , but I could n't find the time , so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother while I was gone . My mother wept , telling me to obey orders and fight bravely , and saying , " I wo n't close my eyes without seeing you back , my son . " I promised her that I would return , although in the back of my mind lingered the fear that I might fall on a battlefield . Julan was n't a pretty girl , but she was even-tempered and had a fine figure , a born dancer with long , supple limbs . She wore a pair of thick braids , and her clear eyes were innocently vivid . When she smiled , her straight teeth would flash . It was her radiant smile that had caught my heart . She was terribly upset by my imminent departure , but accepted our separation as a necessary sacrifice for our motherland . To most Chinese , it was obvious that MacArthur 's army intended to cross the Yalu River and seize Manchuria , the Northeast of China . As a serviceman I was obligated to go to the front and defend our country . Julan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in me , though in private she often shed tears . I tried to comfort her , saying , " Do n't worry . I 'll be back in a year or two . " We promised to wait for each other . She broke her jade barrette and gave me a half as a pledge of her love . After a four-day train ride , our division arrived at a villagelike town named Potou , in Cang County , Hebei Province . There we shed our assorted old weapons and were armed with burp guns and artillery pieces made in Russia . From now on all our equipment had to be standardized . Without delay we began to learn how to use the new weapons . The instructions were only in Russian , but nobody in our division understood the Cyrillic alphabet . Some units complained that they could n't figure out how to operate the antiaircraft machine guns effectively . Who could help them ? They asked around but did n't find any guidance . As a last resort , the commissar of our division , Pei Shan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who happened to share a table with Pei at a state dinner held in Tianjin City , but the Russian officer could n't help us either . So the soldiers were ordered : " Learn to master your weapons through using them . " As a clerical officer , I was given a brand-new Russian pistol to replace my German Mauser . This change did n't bother me . Unlike the enlisted men , I did n't have to go to the drill with my new handgun . By now I had realized that my appointment at the headquarters of the 180th Division might be a part of a large plan-I knew some English and could be useful in fighting the Americans . Probably our division had been under consideration for being sent into battle for quite a while . Before we left Szechuan , Commissar Pei had told me to bring along an English-Chinese dictionary . He said amiably , " Keep it handy , Comrade Yu Yuan . It will serve as a unique weapon . " He was a tall man of thirty-two , with a bronzed face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could feel the inner strength of this man , who had been a dedicated revolutionary since his early teens . Before we moved northeast , all the officers who had originally served in the Nationalist army and now held positions at the regimental level and above were ordered to stay behind . More than a dozen of them surrendered their posts and were immediately replaced by Communist officers transferred from other units . This personnel shuffle indicated that men recruited from the old army were not trusted . Though the Communists may have had their reasons for dismissing those officers , replacing them right before battle later caused disasters in the chain of command when we were in Korea , because there was n't enough time for the new officers and their men to get to know one another . A week after the Spring Festival we entrained for Dandong , the frontier city on the Yalu River . The freight train carrying us departed early in the afternoon so that we could reach the border around midnight . Our division would rest and drill there for half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mill in a northern suburb of Dandong . Inside the city , military offices and supply stations were everywhere , the streets crowded with trucks and animal-drawn vehicles . Some residential houses near the riverbank had collapsed , apparently knocked down by American bombs . The Yalu had thawed , though there were still gray patches of ice and snow along the shore . I had once seen the river in a documentary film , but now , viewed up close , it looked different from what I had expected . It was much narrower but more turbulent , frothy in places and full of small eddies . The water was slightly green- " Yalu " means " duck green " in Chinese . A beardless old man selling spiced pumpkin seeds on the street told me that in summertime the river often overflowed and washed away crops , apple trees , houses . Sometimes the flood drowned livestock and people . One morning I went downtown to an army hotel to fetch some slides that showed the current situation in Korea . On my way there , I saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twin bridges over the Yalu . As the sirens shrilled , dozens of antiaircraft guns fired at the planes , around which flak explosions clustered like black blossoms . One of the Mustangs was hit the moment it dropped its bombs , drawing a long tail of smoke and darting toward the Yellow Sea . As they watched the falling plane and the hovering parachute , some civilians applauded and shouted , " Good shot ! " We drilled with our new weapons and learned about the other units ' experiences in fighting the American and the South Korean armies . We all knew the enemy was better equipped and highly mechanized with air support , which we did n't have . But our superiors told us not to be afraid of the American troops , who had been spoiled and softened by comforts . GIs could n't walk and were road-bound , depending completely on automobiles ; if no vehicles were available , they 'd hire Korean porters to carry their bedrolls and food . Even their enlisted men did n't do KP and had their shoes shined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the war , they lacked the determination to fight . They were all anxious to have a vacation , which they would be given monthly . Even if we were inferior in equipment , we could make full use of our tactics of night fighting and close combat . At the mere sight of us , the Americans would go to their knees and surrender-they were just pussycats . To arouse the soldiers ' hatred for the enemy , a group of men , led by a political instructor , pulled around a hand truck loaded with a huge bomb casing which was said to be evidence that the U.S. was carrying on bacteriological warfare . They displayed the thing at every battalion , together with photographs of infected creatures , such as giant flies , rats , mosquitoes , clams , cockroaches , earthworms . The germ bomb , which was said to have landed near the train station , was almost five feet long and two feet across , with four sections inside . This kind of bomb , we were told , would not explode ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release the germ carriers . To be honest , some of us had rubbed shoulders with Americans when we were in the Nationalist army , and we were unnerved , because we knew the enemy was not only superior in equipment but also better trained . Throughout this period we attended regular meetings at which both civilians and soldiers would condemn American imperialism . An old peasant said his only farm cattle , a team of two , had been shot dead by a U.S. plane while he was harvesting sweet potatoes in his field near the border . A woman soldier walked around among the audience , holding up large photographs of Korean women and children killed by the South Korean army . A reporter spoke about many atrocities committed by the American invaders . Sometimes the speakers seized the occasion to vent their own grievances . They often identified the United States as the source of their personal troubles . A college graduate of dark complexion even claimed to an audience of eight hundred that his health had been ruined by the American film industry , because he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to masturbate . Now he could n't control himself anymore , he confessed publicly . These kinds of condemnations , high and low , boosted the morale of the soldiers , who grew restless , eager to wipe out the enemy of the common people . On the night of March 17 we crossed the Yalu . Every infantryman carried a submachine gun , two hundred rounds of ammunition , four grenades , a canteen of water , a pair of rubber sneakers and a short shovel on the back of his bedroll , and a tubed sack of parched wheat flour weighing thirteen pounds . We walked gingerly on the eastern bridge , because the western one was partly damaged . Each man kept ten feet from the one in front of him . The water below was dark , hissing and plunging . Now and then someone would cry out , his foot having fallen through a hole . A tall mule , drawing a cart , got its hind leg stuck in a rift and could n't dislodge it no matter how madly the driver thrashed its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it shook , then keeled over and fell into the river together with the helpless animal . There was a great splash , followed by an elongated whirlpool in the shimmering current , and then the entire load of medical supplies vanished . Having left behind our insignias and IDs , from now on we called ourselves the Chinese People 's Volunteers . This was to differentiate us from the army back home , so that China , nominally having not sent its regular troops to Korea , might avoid a full-blown war with the United States . We were ordered to reach , within fourteen days , a town called Yichun , very close to the Thirty-eighth Parallel . The distance was about four hundred miles , and we would have to walk all the way . It was early spring , the air still chilly ; the roads were muddy , soaked by thawing ice and snow , hard for us to trudge through . The divisional headquarters had two jeeps that transported the leaders and their staff . Sometimes the jeeps would drop off the officers and turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer march thanks to blisters on their feet . I walked the whole time except for once , when Commissar Pei wanted me to get on his jeep so that I could figure out the meaning of the English words on a folded handbill someone had picked up on the way . It turned out to be the menu of a restaurant in Seoul , which must have served Americans mainly , because the menu was only in English . I could n't understand all the words , but could roughly describe the dishes and soups to Pei Shan . The entrees included broiled flounder filet , beef steak , fried chicken , meat loaf . Besides the commissar 's orderly , a clerical officer named Chang Ming , who edited our division 's bulletin , often boarded the jeep . I envied him for that . Whenever we stopped somewhere for the night , Chang Ming would be busy interviewing people and writing articles . Commissar Pei seemed a born optimist . He often laughed heartily , jutting his chin and showing his buckteeth . He looked more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our division commander , Niu Jinping , was a wisp of a man , who had once been the vice director of the Political Department of the Sixty-second Army . I often saw a cunning light in Niu 's round eyes ; in his presence I was always cautious about what I said . When he smiled he seldom opened his lips , chuckling through his nose as if his mouth were stuffed with food . He was a chain-smoker , and his orderly carried a whole bag of brand-name cigarettes for him . Both the commander and the commissar were in their early thirties , and neither was experienced in directing battle operations . Back in Dandong City , I had n't been able to imagine the magnitude of the war 's destruction . Now , to my horror , I saw that most villages east of the Yalu lay in ruins . The land looked empty , with at least four-fifths of the houses leveled to the ground . The standing ones were mostly deserted . Most of the Korean houses were shabby , with thatched hip roofs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of them were mere huts that had gaping holes as windows . It must have been hard to farm this rugged land , where boulders and rocks stuck out of the ground everywhere ; yet it seemed every scrap of tillable soil was used , and even low hills were terraced with small patches of cropland . We came across Korean civilians from time to time . Most of them were in rags , women in white dresses that had faded into yellow , and old men wearing black top hats with chin straps , reminding me of Chinese men of ancient times . Here and there roads had been cratered , and teams of Chinese laborers were busy filling the holes , carrying earth and stones with wicker baskets affixed to A-frames . The farther south we went , the fewer houses remained intact , and as a result most of us had to sleep in the open air . Generally , during the day it was n't safe for us to march , because American planes would come in droves to attack us . So only after nightfall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , the air raids were constant and sometimes even took place at night . Every infantryman carried at least sixty pounds while each horse was loaded with five times more . Without enough sleep and rest , the troops were soon footsore and exhausted . On the fifth day heavy rain set in and made it impossible for us to lie on the ground to sleep . Some officers in our Political Department clustered together with a piece of tarpaulin over their heads . Many men , too tired to care about the downpour , simply put their bedrolls on the ground , sat on them , and tried to doze that way . Some , staying in a chestnut grove , tied themselves to the trees with ropes so that they could catnap while remaining on their feet . The rain continued in the afternoon , and because we could n't sleep and the enemy bombers were unlikely to come in such weather , we ate our lunch-which was parched flour mixed with water , as sticky as batter-and went on our way . The following night , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly three green signal flares whooshed up ahead of us . At first I thought they must have been fired by our vanguard , but then some officers began to whisper that someone on the mountain was signaling our whereabouts to the enemy . I had heard that a good number of Korean agents worked for the Americans on the sly , but I had n't expected to encounter something like this in the wilderness . As we were talking about the possible meanings of those signals , four planes appeared in the southeast , roaring toward us . " Take cover ! " a voice ordered . Some of us rushed into the nearby bushes and some lay down in the roadside ditches . The planes dropped a few flash bombs , a shower of light illuminating the entire area ; our troops and vehicles at once became visible . Then bombs rained down and machine guns began raking us . Some horses and mules were startled and vaulted over the prostrate men , dashing away into the darkness . A bomb exploded in front of me and tossed half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the slope of a gully , not daring to lift my head to the scorching air , and keeping my mouth open so that the explosions would n't pop my eardrums . Around me , men hollered and moaned , and some were twisting on the ground screaming for help . Some , though dead or unconscious , were still clutching their submachine guns . The bombardment lasted only five minutes but killed about a hundred men and wounded many more . Along the road , flames and smoke were rising from shattered carts and disabled mountain guns . As I looked for Chang Ming , I saw two orderlies coming my way , supporting an officer . I recognized the officer , Tang Jing , the quartermaster of our divisional staff . He looked all right , though one of the orderlies kept shouting , " Doctor , doctor ! We need a doctor here ! " But all the medical personnel were busy helping the seriously wounded , assembling them for shipment back to our rear base . Division commander Niu ordered an engineering company to dig a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bury the dead . Finally Dr. Wang turned up with a flashlight and asked Tang Jing , " Where were you hit ? " The quartermaster did n't register the question , his fleshy face vacant while his eyes glittered without a blink . " Are you injured ? " the doctor asked again . Tang Jing opened his mouth but no sound came out . He was trembling all over , unable to speak a word . Dr. Wang felt his forehead and then his pulse . Everything seemed normal , so he did n't know what to do . We had to reassemble and continue to march , but we were unsure whether we should take the quartermaster along . Another doctor , Li Wen , arrived , and together the two doctors checked him again , but they found nothing unusual except that his temperature was slightly above normal . " Shell shock . He lost his mind , " said Dr. Li . " Can he hear ? " an orderly asked . " I 'm not sure . " " What should we do about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 'll take a long time for him to recover . " " I ca n't believe this , " said Chang Ming , who had joined us for a while . " He 's such a strapping man , yet he lost his mind so easily . " The two orderlies helped the quartermaster to his feet and walked him toward a team of stretcher bearers who were going to carry the wounded back to our base . I had been struck by the vast number of Chinese laborers in Korea . Most of them came from Manchuria , and some were over forty years old . They were able to mix with the Koreans because they could speak Japanese , which had been taught in both Manchurian and Korean schools during the Japanese occupation ; yet their lives here were as precarious as the soldiers ' . Although constantly under air and artillery attacks , they had to repair roads , build bridges , unload supplies , and ship the casualties back from the front . A lot of them had been killed or wounded . Right in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , carrying one end of a stretcher , on which lay a man with his face bandaged . The wounded man kept wailing , " They lied to us ! They lied to us ! " Our divisional leaders were unsettled by the loss of lives , equipment , animals , and supplies , but I was more shaken by Tang Jing 's case . For a whole week his expressionless face went on haunting me . Never had I thought a man 's mind was so easy to destroy . The next morning , on a roadway leading to Seoul , we ran into a group of U.N . prisoners , about seventy men , marching past us from the opposite direction . The majority of them were Turks , some tall , some quite short , with haggard faces . At the end of the procession were about a dozen Americans , mostly large men wearing parkas . One of them wore steel-rimmed glasses and a tufty red beard . The POWs could n't walk fast on account of injury and fatigue , and some hobbled along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese guards , toting rifles with fixed bayonets , were rough with them . One officer yelled in a strident voice , " Faster , do n't drop behind ! You need a ride , eh ? I tell you , we have no vehicles to relieve your pampered feet . " Although the prisoners could n't understand him , they looked frightened and hung their heads low . The encounter cheered us up a little . Our political officers began working to convince the rank and file of the enemy 's weakness despite their airpower . Likewise , the U.N . side had never slackened its psychological work either . The roads we trod were strewn with leaflets , dropped by American planes and printed in both Chinese and Korean , urging us to capitulate . One had an ancient couplet on it : " How piteously the skeletons lie on the riverside / Still dreaming of a pretty bride ! " Another showed a woodcut in which a young woman stood on the shoulder of a mountain , gazing into the distance , longing for her man 's return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many men pocketed them to roll cigarettes with or to use as toilet paper , but once you glanced through these sheets , a heavy sadness would stir in your chest , sinking your heart . Our food supplies , carried by the horse carts , had been used up by the end of the first week , so now the only thing we had to eat was the parched flour in the tubed sacks draped across our chests . Some men found and picked wild herbs-dandelions , purslanes , wild chives , and onions . There was a kind of wild garlic in Korea , whose heads were still tiny but good-tasting , pungent and crispy , not as spicy as the regular garlic . You could eat both their heads and their green tops , but they were scarce in the early spring when most herbs were just beginning to sprout . Some trees were sending out yellowish leaves , which many men plucked and ate . I did n't eat many wild herbs or tree leaves , because I could n't tell poisonous ones from good ones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food poisoning . There were so many troops moving toward and back from the front that as soon as it was dark , the roads turned chaotic , noisy , and jammed with traffic-trucks , artillery pieces , carts drawn by animals , teams of Chinese porters carrying supplies and ammunition , and lines of stretchers loaded with the wounded . Once I saw a camel laden with mortar shells . Every night each regiment of our division had about a hundred stragglers , incapacitated by exhaustion and sore feet . A movement was started among the ranks , called " Leave No Comrade Behind . " Officers and Party members were supposed to help carry bedrolls , guns , and bandoliers for those who had difficulty keeping up . I was moved when I saw squad and platoon leaders fetch hot water for their men to bathe their feet . This marked a difference between the Communist army and the Nationalist army , in which even some junior officers had eaten better food than their men and had often abused their inferiors . We arrived at the Thirty-eighth Parallel on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer stand on their feet . My legs were swollen and one of my shoes had lost its sole . Our divisional leaders pleaded with the Headquarters of the Chinese People 's Volunteer Army for a week 's rest , but the superiors allowed us only one day off . We ate a hearty meal-rice and pork stewed with turnip and broad potato noodles . After the meal , like sick animals , we slept in the mountain woods for the rest of the day . 2 . OUR COLLAPSE SOUTH OF THE THIRTY-EIGHTH PARALLEL The fourth-phase offensive had just ended two months ago in February ; I wondered why we were starting the fifth one so soon . Common sense dictates that the success of a large battle depends on the buildup of supplies and munitions and on the thorough preparation of troops . Although several field armies had just arrived from interior China , most of the men were bone-weary from the arduous trek and unfamiliar with the foreign climate and terrain , let alone the nature of the enemy we faced . We were told that this offensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the hostile forces to the south of the Thirty-seventh Parallel . In our superiors ' words , " We 're going to eliminate some of their unit designations . " I had misgivings about that because our equipment was far too inferior , but I did n't reveal my thoughts to anyone . For the time being my job was to help Chang Ming edit the bulletin . Ming had graduated from Beijing University and majored in classics , for which he was well respected , even by higher-ranking officers . He also knew English but could n't speak it fluently . I spoke the language better than most college graduates because in my teens I had attended classes taught by an American missionary in my hometown . On the evening of April 22 , 1951 , suddenly thousands of our cannons , howitzers , mortars , and Katyusha rocket launchers began bombarding the enemy 's positions ; thus started the fifth-phase offensive . As usual when the Chinese forces unleashed a major attack , a full moon hung in the sky , ready to facilitate our men 's night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 179th , 180th , and 181st Divisions , was assigned to attack the Turkish Brigade and the U.S. Third Division , both positioned in front of us . The battle proceeded so smoothly that our divisional leaders were bewildered-in just one day we advanced more than ten miles without encountering any serious resistance . Why did n't the enemy engage us ? Had they been overwhelmed by our bombardment ? Or were they just eluding us ? Or was this a ruse to lure us farther south ? Our superiors had their doubts , but neither Commander Niu nor Commissar Pei , who lacked the requisite training and experience of senior officers , could guess what was happening . They just executed the orders issued by headquarters . As a rule , without approval from higher up , they were not allowed to order troop movements . This restriction , leaving no room for the officers ' own initiative , directly contributed to our later defeat . We stayed put for several days and did n't go farther into enemy-occupied territory . A week later when the second stage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korean troops swerved east to attack the South Korean army . Our division 's task was to wedge ourselves between the American and the South Korean forces , specifically to prevent the U.S. First Marine and Seventh Divisions from moving east to reinforce the South Koreans . We occupied the hills south of the Han River , whose water was n't deep in spite of its swift current , and thanks to the favorable terrain we held our position for five days . The two American divisions did n't break our defense line , though they were superior in both firepower and number . By now , most of the Chinese and North Korean field armies were thrust deep inside enemy-occupied territory ; some had pushed forward seventy miles south of the Thirty-eighth Parallel . Then the order came for all units to stop attacking . Obviously the operation had gone awry . The truth was that our field armies had advanced so fast and so deep that our supply lines had crumbled . Apart from the logistical disaster , our men on the front had suffered heavy casualties . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or retreated , they would always remain close enough to inflict casualties on our forces . This time they dragged our troops deep into South Korea , cut their connections with the echelons , isolated and encircled them , and tried to annihilate them . Apparently the enemy had gained the upper hand , so the Headquarters of the Chinese People 's Volunteer Army had to call off the offensive . Most of the line officers had no idea of the situation , and some even assumed we had won a victory . I came to know of the truth because I often served as a secretary at the meetings at which our divisional leaders discussed plans of action . A few days later the Americans launched an all-out counterattack . Their artillery shells and aerial bombs landed on the hills defended by our division , loosening the dirt and cutting down trees , some of which burst into flames . Despite not knowing what to do or where to go , we held our line and fought back the enemy 's advances again and again . Not until the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cross the Han River , and build a defense along its north bank . Immediately we began to retreat . But that same evening another telegram came , ordering us not to cross the river , and instead to set up a defense line on the south shore and hold it for four days to cover thousands of wounded men being shipped back from the front . This was easier said than done . We had no food left , and our right flank would be exposed-the Sixty-third Army , which was supposed to cover it , had already retreated to the north of the river . How on earth could we fight in such disarray ? The enemy saw our predicament , so they assembled more men , tanks , and artillery , and kept pursuing us.
