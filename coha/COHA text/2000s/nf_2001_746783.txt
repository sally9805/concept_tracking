ERNESTINA de Champourcin was a prolific poet who published in the 1920s at the same time as the members of the Generation of 27 . She was one of the two female poets included in Gerardo Diego 's landmark anthology of 1934 , and she was called a prophetic priestess by Juan Ramn Jimnez in one of his lyrical portraits of his contemporaries collected in Espaoles de tres mundos . These gestures of recognition notwithstanding , her work has been marginalized from the official Spanish canon and , until very recently , forgotten . Her exclusion has been explained through a myriad of possible reasons : because her gynocentric style conflicts with the prevailing androcentric one ( Wilcox ) , because her marriage diverted her attention to her husband ( Ciplijauskait ) , because of the condescension and sexism of critics and of her devotion to Juan Ramn ( Debicki ) , or simply because " La tragedia de su vida fue nacer mujer en un mundo hecho a medida de los hombres " ( Cardoso ) . Some recent critics have tried to vindicate this exclusion by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilcox , Perz ) . Others have attempted to certify her as a poet in other ways . Jse Angel Ascunce calls her one of the most important women poets of the Generation of 27 ( Prologue xi ) , and Luzmara Jimnez Faro maintains she is the only woman poet of that group ( Champourcn Antologa 11 ) . What critics have not done yet is to treat her purely as a poet , as a professional writer who evolves over time in her relationship to her concept of poetry . <p> Over her long career , Champourcn 's poetry evolves from a repository for emotions to a site for aesthetic invention and finally to a vehicle of communication and transcendence . Her poetic persona begins as a passive receiver of poetry to become an active agent of creation and then a converser with sublime forces . Her changing creative posture mirrors the chronological progression of her life and the substantive advancement in the psychological development of her poetic speaker . The incipient poet speaks with the self-absorption that characterizes the adolescent psyche . As the adult poet emerges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assertive stance before the poetic enterprise . The mature woman finds self-fulfillment through poetry because it provides her a means to the jouissance or joy that spiritual transfiguration and harmony generate . These phases readily suggest the three basic stages in the development of the self : birth , growth , and maturity . But they also outline the transcendent possibilities of poetry . The evolution of Champourcn 's concept of poetry from spontaneous inspiration to conscious execution and then to a form of communication with God recalls Antonio Machado 's poem beginning " Anoche cuando dorma / so bendita ilusin . , " with its three images of fountain , beehive , and sun as symbols of the ascending trajectory of faith , life , or the poetic process . For Machado , as well as for Champourcn , the ultimate vision is that of God , but , while her predecessor only sees his " bendita ilusin " in a dream state , Champourcn 's relationship is that of direct , devout , and conversational contact . Furthermore , Champourcn goes beyond the implications revealed in her interchanges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces spiritual freedom and transcendence . <p> Despite the multiple functions that poetry fulfilled for her , Champourcn 's conscious posture toward her creative process was modest and evasive . Therefore , her changing conception of poetry must be inferred from her poems directly setting forth her poetics rather than from her prose statements . From the very beginning , she refused to theorize about poetry and , upon reflection , she denied it any transcendent purpose . She declined to provide her poetics for Diego 's anthology , saying instead " Mi concepto de la poesa ? Carezco en absoluto de conceptos " ( Diego 460 ) . She resisted accepting credit or responsibility for her poetic confections , preferring to see herself as the fortunate recipient of poetry 's splendid gifts . In 1975 she told an interviewer that her poetry was a result of inspiration and never a product of deliberate effort : " A m la poesa me viene , no s de donde ; creo en el Espritu Santo yen la inspiracin " ( Villar 14 ) . After nearly sixty-five years of poetry writing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a gift , not a task , and a vocation , not a profession ( Ascunce , " Ernestina de Champourcn , " 23 ; Bellver 75 ; Bermejo ) . The only time other than in the Diego anthology that Champourcn addressed the question of poetic theory was in the prologue of her 1988 collection Huyeron todas las islas ; and even then she reflected on her poetics as an act of resistance , titling her prologue " antipotica . " Besides reiterating her perennial belief that poetry emanates spontaneously from mysterious regions of the mind " como llovizna , surtidor o cascada , " the octogenarian continued to subscribe to Juan Ramon 's notion that inspiration released as a tone , accent , or emotion determines structure and form . As Milagros Arizmendi observes , Champourcn seems to imply that the poetic process follows a line of evolution that goes from inspiration to interpretation of a message , which in the form of an intangible must be transformed into a translatable concept that allows the initial , inspired moment to be reproduced ( 30 ) . <p> Champourcn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an easily executable task may have been a way to ensure its value as the sublime experience it was for Juan Ramn , but her demure detachment from poetic theory and creative agency can also be interpreted as a strategy for survival within the arena of male privilege in which she emerged as a poet . The modesty and self-effacement she adopted reflects a certain " anxiety of authorship " and an attempt to minimize any threat to the established literary order that her talents as a poet might pose . Her unassuming stance deflected the impact of her bold intrusion into the realm of male prerogative and its implicit affirmation of women 's capacity for masterful poetic creation . <p> In real life Champourcn may have refused to articulate her poetics , but in her poems the uninitiated poet revealed from the outset a consciousness of her craft and her position as a poet . Her first book , En silencio . ( 1926 ) , is a collection with overt romantic tonalities and obvious allusions to the poets she admired most . Her exaggerated deference reveals the immaturity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the beginning , Champourcn was a well-read practitioner of poetry capable of assimilating different literary trends . In keeping with the impact of Romanticism on her first poetry , she characterizes both the poet and poetry as somnambulant inertness . Like Bcquer and Juan Ramn , she conceived of poetry as an altered state of consciousness or of lofty spirituality . <p> Landscapes emerging as visions , souls wrapped in a nocturnal haze , and the beloved appearing in dreams create an environment of quietude and lethargy in En silencio .. The figure of the poet stands on this silent , dimmed stage , lost in reverie , contemplating the scenery but never speaking . In the poem entitled " Acuarela , " Champourcn first paints a picture of a slow river peacefully flowing on a splendid morning and then points to a figure on the bridge , a man with sad , " Bohemian " eyes , identified as a poet : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The poet focuses on another world and another time , his eyes sweeping upward to the heavens and back in time to the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written not by human hands , but by nature , by the moss that testifies to the castle 's story . Any revelation of historical fact is quickly deterred because the poet loses himself in vague dreams and the entire scene evaporates in a vision of golden mist : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The chimerical quality within the text is duplicated on the level of reading , because , as the title of the poem suggests , this poem is either a meditation on an actual watercolor or a rendering of reality as a painting . In either case , the poet is a figment of the imagination of the writer , a prop in her scenography , not a living human being . The poet in this poem is a preestablished picture of a poet , an object Champourcn reproduces , but with whom she does not yet identify herself . He is a fascinating other , not a manifestation of her own psychic impulses . <p> Not yet confident of her creative power or bold enough to project her poetic self into boundless future spaces , she views her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead poets : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Her words at this point are echoes of her predecessors and tributes to their ghosts . If not for the poets who went before her , Champourcn writes for those around her in need of poetry . She concludes En silencio . offering her verses to all misfortunate souls without illusions ( " almas fras desnudas de ensueo " ) and suffering from existential tedium ( " enfermas de hasto " ) . Calling them silent but latent poets ( " poetas sin lira " ) , she verbalizes her equation between poetry and dream : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Champourcn sees herself at the service of unidentified groups of kindred spirits . Her poetry is a gift , a state , of being , or an inert repository for emotions . She begins and ends this final poem of En silencio . with a metaphor that renders poetry writing as the deflowering of a maiden : " Deshoj la flor de mis rimas / en el triste jrdn de las almas . " This vision of virginal awakening in a garden of emotional delights is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poetry in this book , writes Ascunce , is " una especie de desbordamiento emocional en donde se concretan los afectos ms ntimos y los deseos ms suspirados " ( Prologue XXX ) . In the initial phase of Champourcn 's literary production , poetry constitutes an emotional trance in which the poet slumbers in a state , of passive reception . <p> In her next collection , Ahora ( 1928 ) , Champourcn sheds the Romantic cloak of sentimentality and wraps her poems instead in a Modernist garb that allows for experimental forms . This shift in aesthetic orientation signals a change in her concept of poetry . Having become increasing more aware of her evolution as an artist , Champourcn openly admits her desire to leave behind antiquated aesthetic mannerisms : " Quiero hablar de mi Castilla / sin arcaicos lagrimeos , / sin retrico oropel / ni lirismo sensiblero " ( 99 ) . Poetry becomes a workshop for experimentation and a vehicle for self-exploration . No longer an emotional state of being , the poem becomes a site the lyrical speaker can occupy and in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poetry loses its static contours as a intangible receptacle to become a " Text , " in Barthes ' definition of experienced activity . <p> By 1928 various strains of the vanguard movement , particularly ultrasmo and surrealism , had taken root in Spain . They coincided with the Modernist spirit in their rejection of the emotionalism of their immediate predecessors , in their desire to elude empirical reality in favor of the " superior " realms of the word and the human psyche , and in their exaltation of the metaphor as the essential raw material of poetic creation and innovation . Therefore , in Ahora Champourcn was not only revealing her growing maturity as a poet , she was also demonstrating her ability to incorporate into her work the prevailing poetic trends of her day . Critics have already noted the impact of new cultural modes on her poetry . In this phase of her poetic evolution , Ascunce finds evidence of the ludic spirit associated with the " gregueras " of Ramn Gmez de la Serna ( " La poesa " ) . Debicki sees in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 50-52 ) . <p> In keeping with the dichotomy perceived by the predominant vanguard poets between material reality and the artistic sphere , Champourcn 's poetry takes on a life of its own , becoming an autonomous realm with grand harmony and no limits : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> No longer the altruistic benefactor of those not blessed with the poetic word , the poet is now compelled to recognize the inadequacy of the voice of all humans in contrast to the sublime harmony of the moment and the opus of time . She does not , however , feel intimidated by cosmic marvels . On the contrary , Champourcn 's growing aspirations of transcendence lead her to harness the poetic for its power to uplift . <p> The poetic speaker stands poised between lowly terrestrial existence and the divine realm of fantasy : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Instead of wandering in a vaporous dream world , the speaker as poet now stands apart from the essence of poetry . Wiped clean of traces of the words of previous poets , her page is now blank . She purports to write ex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By distancing herself from poetry , the poetic " I " gains strength and a consciousness of herself as poet . She assumes the role of artisan who crafts her own creations with marked assertion . With a metaphor that Wilcox calls " redolent with phallic aggression " ( 89 ) , Champourcn envisions the poet indelibly branding the blank page . The poetic artist as a painter of delicate water colors has been supplanted by the engraver who forcefully scratches inert surfaces . Presumably free from the " anxiety of authorship " that according to Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar plagued women when taking up the pen , Champourcn confidently accepts the role of artist at the center of the creative process . She adapts the patriarchal myth of masterful , masculine generation W a feminine perspective , by unabashedly displacing the figure of the father with the mother as the creator of the universe and identifying herself with that maternal force : " Bes en la misma frente / a la cndida infancia de todo el universo. / Fui madre de las cosas y madre de la Vida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poet , her poetry becomes a serious task of studied transformation of reality and the self . One part of this reorientation of perspective encompasses the tranformative and often visionary nature of the images and other stylistic devices she uses . As Debicki demonstrates in his insightful study of the interior structure of the imagery in Champourcn 's early poetry , her creation of objective correlatives of subjective realities calls attention to the creative process ( 49 ) . Another part of her shift in posture is her change in the literary referents underpinning her verses . She discards a spent Romantic tradition to take part in the vanguard current of the day with its emphasis on the creative potential of words . Paradoxically , the more the poet distances herself from her poetic text the more her self-realization is linked to its execution . She distances herself from the world unfolding within her poetic universe by minimizing the specific referents of her poetic subjects and by objectifying human sentiments through filters of vanguard discourse . Although the poetic voice in Ahora speaks in the first person , she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created persona who dramatizes the process of poetic creation . Ascunce sees in Ahora a reflection of Juan Ramn and his " pure poetry " in the distancing of the implied poet , the hermetic expression , and the reliance on symbolization ( Prologue , XXXVII ) . Although this may be true , her debt to him is decidedly different from her imitative tributes in En silencio .. In Ahora , she assimilates the interior mechanisms of his poetry in order to create her own vision . <p> With Champourcn 's more assertive stance toward her poetry , comes a greater vitality and sense of self-esteem . She begins to take delight in her power-in her inner strength , her assertiveness before the other , and her ability to create : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Self-fulfillment becomes closely linked to poetic fulfillment . The poetic " I " realizes itself because it possesses the capacity to create poetry . As the poet clearly attests in the last poem of Ahora , her lyrical persona is capable of confronting the void of the " hoja blanca . " Out of the chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " los xtasis del alma " ) that pass before her mind ( " frente " ) , she produces visible marks on a writing surface . <p> This new relationship Champourcn established in Ahora had important implications for the female writer of her time . Whether poets or not , women were assumed , within patriarchal discourse , to be emotional beings restricted to reacting instinctively to inner feelings and therefore incapable of reaching the intellectual heights required for deliberate artistic production . Women could only create biologically as passive vessels for the benefit of nature , while men were the active generators of art . Even when intending to praise the female poet , the paternalistic male critic did so by seeing in her an admirable conformity to women 's " mission . " For example , in 1926 , Rafael Cansinos-Assens wrote , " Ernestina de Champourcn acepta su abnegada misin de mujer y con gesto ms pdico que la Ibarborou sic , se ofrece como ella , entre las frondas de los mirtos , a Aqul que ha de Ilegar . " With the poetry Champourcn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which men had tried to confine women . <p> Despite her enduring refusal to theorize or to inflate her role as poet , Champourcn clearly challenged the notion of woman as unconscious , unintellectual , and unsophisticated writer . Her poems reveal that she believed in the power of poetry to restructure reality and establish relationships between herself and the other-be it a human love , God , or the word itself . She also wrote poems that defined the art of poetic creation , articulated her concern for writing a new kind of poetry , and commented on the reception of her poetry . She counted herself among the avant garde , answering in the following manner the question " Qu es la vanguardia ? " for a survey published in La Gaceta Literaria : " Los movimientos vanguardistas se han caracterizado siempre , lo mismo en la literatura que en la vida , por un afn , a veces desmedido , de novedades .. Actualmente se seala por un saludable temor al sentimentalismo , al tpico y a las formas ampulosas de la vieja retrica " ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promote the new women poets of her day by publishing an article in 1929 in which she celebrated the superiority of her generation over that of the Romantic period and praised five of her contemporary female poets . Although she rejected the label of feminist , she stated her interest in women freeing themselves from limitations placed upon them ( Villar 12 ) ; and she made what could be called a feminist response to the reception of her books . She defended her inclusion of sixteen women in her anthology of religious poetry by stating she was not any different from the men who filled their books with male writers . She also , over the years , recounted to interviewers the stir caused among the critics when , in 1926 , three women published books of poetry in the same year . Eschewing straightforward feminist commentary , she attributed the disbelief that promoted some to suggest that the women had not written the books themselves to the unusualness of the event : " Eso produjo una crtica que se le puede llamar si se quiere machismo , aunque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ que no podamos ser capaces de escribir " ( Canales ) . <p> Champourcn intensifies her declarations of self-confidence in her next collection , La voz en el viento . The initial and title poem announces the disposition of her new poetic protagonist . She is an exultant , cosmic bare-back rider who proclaims her own capacity to soar and the power of the word ( her wind-steed ) to reach untrod heights ( " cumbre sin hollados " ) and fill fathomless depths ( " vacos insondados " ) : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Poetry has become a liberating adventure in which the poetic speaker disengages herself from earthly reality and assumes dominion over her verse , her reader , and the cosmos . Espejo-Saavedra perceives in this poem echoes of " Viento saltado " by Jorge Guilln , published a year earlier ( 136 ) . Although this observation is legitimate , the wind as a symbol of freedom has a longer history that reaches back to Espronceda 's " Cancin del pirata " ; and it has a particular significance within works by women . Hlne Cixous insists that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthbound , and horizontal that flying becomes a " woman 's gesture " ( 291 ) . Flying represents a distinctly female dream with literal as well as metaphorical implications of escape or change . Champourcn 's female contemporary Concha Mndez , in Canciones de mar y tierra ( Buenos Aires , 1930 ) , also portrayed her poetic speaker swept up to exciting heights by the wind . Both these poets created in the twenties and thirties textual realities in which female speakers projected youthful vitality and enjoyed freedom , movement , and transcendence . <p> The poem " La voz en el viento " serves as a preface , in Champourcn 's collection by the same name , to a whole series of compositions centered on the adventure of liberation . The poetic speaker conceives of herself as a free and active agent capable of creating or re-creating an other predisposed to her influence . That other can be her beloved or the word itself . She describes herself as the generator of love who holds the " antorcha creadora " and as a spirit of beauty and purity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their love for one another . As an artistic creator , she inscribes on the page-the soul of the other-her image of ideal love . From this perspective , love becomes a text of her own invention and poetry an act of sensual generation : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Both types of creation are executed with calm and dispassionate premeditation , " despacio " and " framente , " and with the purpose of capturing the substance ( " estructura " ) of her ideal ( " sueo " ) . The finished product rests within the blurred contours of the other 's spirit ; but despite its intangible qualities , it has form and weight , as suggested by " forma anclada . " Assuming that the poetic speaker in this key poem is the same protagonist identified throughout the collection as female by feminine adjective , the reader discovers that this poetic creator has reversed the common representation of gender , portraying the male as the painted object and the female as the painter , the artist who represents the masculine other in her poem . <p> In La voz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gentler than the " cicatrices de oro " produced by her pen in Ahora , but this collection as well as her fourth one , Cntico intil , presents a speaker who is an agent of self-determination . Even though the poetic " I " surrenders herself to the other in gestures of supplication and submission , she is the designer of her conception of love , that " rosa nueva " she sketches onto her beloved 's soul . To the extent she is conscious of her power to transform reality into purer , poetic essence , she enjoys a dominion over herself and the other . After Cntico intil , Champourcn did not publish another book of poetry until sixteen years later , in 1952 . By that date , she had experienced the civil war , gone into exile in Mexico with her husband , the poet Juan Jos Domenchina , and reached the age of forty-seven . Not unexpectedly , the way she viewed poetry had also changed . Poetry was no longer for her an aesthetic exercise metaphorically conceived as sketching ; it became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a prayer , was the medium of that interchange . <p> Most critics who treat Champourcn 's postwar poetry refer to her shift from human to divine love and the mystical dimensions that came with this change . Some hasten to note that her mysticism varies from that of traditional mystic poets . Ascunce perceives a variance only in her addition of a " dimensin mariana " to the Holy Trinity ( Prologue XVI ) ; and Ventura Doreste believes she does not coincide with the mystics at all . He rejects the label of mystic altogether preferring to call her merely a passionate believer . More accurate and complete is Mercedes Acillona 's appraisal of Champourcn 's religious poetry . She maintains that Champourcn combines the ascetic and the mystical , an active and passive posture , a sense of surrender and one of aspiration . Rather than echoing liturgical songs , the existential meditation of Antonio Machado , or the mystical lyricism of San Juan de la Cruz , her poetry in Presencia a oscuras , says Acillona , " nace a la luz de una tradicin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literarios que se le abran " and evokes the devoutness , humility , and straightforwardness of Santa Teresa ( Acillona 117 ) . My concern is not to determine the specific genre of these poems or the influences in them , but to explore the function that poetry assumes in these prayer poems . <p> No longer a medium to display her knowledge of her cultural heritage or a place for aesthetic experimentation that puts her on a par with her fellow poets , poetry becomes for Champourcn an intimate , private matter between herself and her God . Champourcn turns away from rite human world of exile , suffering , and imperfection and to the divine world of truth , hope , and salvation . Distancing herself from the material world of the present , she sets her sights on the eternal realm of mystery and light . Her poetic voice assumes an introspective posture . The speaking " I " in Champourcn 's first poetry was a sentimental , emotional " I " ; in her next two collections it became an assertive , creative persona ; and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplative . Like in the third vision of the Machado poem referred to at the beginning of this study , the new speaker discerns a path of light that promises transcendence . Presencia a oscuras , as it appears in the collection Poesa a travs del tiempo , opens with an appeal to light : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> God is the only inhabitant of her world but his presence suffices ; he is a friend , a refuge , and the answer to all questions . With a blend of affection and mystic exaltation , she pleads to die in order to be reborn in Him : " Hazme morir a todo para nacer en Ti " ( 204 ) . Her repeated affirmation of her total surrender to God implies a denial of the self greater than any expression of submission to the human lover in her pre-civil war poetry . However , instead of restriction and limitation , within the mystic 's definition , the loss of the personal self to God engenders spiritual freedom and plenitude . Willingly imposing psychological self-exile upon herself , Champourcn 's poetic speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to dwell in the rarefied , interior domain of the spirit where she can be close to the divine Other and begin her journey to transcendence . In the initial poem of Presencia a oscuras , as published in 1952 , she contrasts " amor terreno " to the love of God " : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Not only her poetic speaker , but Champourcn 's entire poetic opus of the period is divorced from her empirical , human reality . In what could be considered a declaration of the poet 's poetics , the first poem of Cartas cerradas ( 1968 ) makes clear Champourcn 's independence from the social poetry of the time with its language of protest and existential grief : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Birut Ciplijauskait sees in this poem " un manifiesto en contestacin a los de Eugenio de Nora y de Jos Hierro , " and she singles out Champourcn 's adoption of the alexandrine meter as evidence of the poet 's concern for form ( 121 ) . The first five lines of the poem indicate that her rejection goes beyond social poetry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invalidation of this literary current by enclosing the word social in quotation marks . For her , poetry must have mystery , something that goes beyond the mundane , the concrete , and the terrestrial . Her commitment to purity makes her prefer to keep silent than to enter into the realm of objectionable language . She turns her back not only on her fellow poets but also on readers , limiting herself to only one addressee . In this phase of her development , by enclosing her works within her letter/poems ( " cartas cerradas " ) to God , she frees herself from the demands of readers and literary fashion . She does not discount that one day her words may be read and the closed letter " se transparente un da , " but at the moment she rejects the language in vogue and turns to the one she prefers . Thus , language is the medium of her defiance and self-realization . <p> Champourcn came to define poetry as a dialogue with God . The poems of Presencia a oscuras , El nombre que me diste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Poemas del ser y del estar become precisely that : a long series of dialogues , or more precisely dramatic monologues , for her interlocutor , although present " a oscuras , " responds to her only through her faith and hope . She maintains the dialogue effect throughout these collections by continually addressing the divinity as Lord , You , or God . The dialogue form establishes a continuum between speaker and addressee that creates textual movement and confers a mark of dynamic occurrences on the poems . Champourcn refocused her attention from the creative capacities of the poet to the potential in the word for communication with one specific addressee . The poem is a means to an end ; it is the vehicle with which to carry her messages of praise , obedience , and devotion to God . <p> The dialogic structure of these poems , created by both the use of direct address and the contents of the messages in them , infuses Champourcn 's poems with a conversational , albeit reverent , tone . Her words are no long " golden scars " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the verbal articulation of God 's name : " Deletreo tu nombre desesperadamente / para que vuelva a mi y responde el silencio " ( 203 ) . As the title of the poem " Letana de soledad " suggests , the poems are litanies , that is , incessant , resonant , and repetitive chants that invoke God or plead for his assistance . The oral quality of the invocations of Presencia a oscuras is substituted by the written word and the letter format in Cartas cerradas . Her tone becomes more colloquial and more personal this book , but the intention continues to be communication with God : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The poet projects her voice through her poems , but the word , the creative matrix of existence , now belongs to God : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> She merely weaves the cloth on which the pattern of God 's words emerge : " Quiero tejer los silencios / donde nace Tu palabra " ( 241 ) . The only book that exists is the divine one in which God writes our destiny . She longs to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's will : " Abreme el libro sellado / donde su Verbo me espera . " The material text of poetry houses God as well as the text of creation . The definition of the text as the dwelling place of God surfaces in these succinct lines from Hai-Kais espirituales : " La pgina es muy densa , pero hay que terminarla / En qu lnea ests T , / acechando , buscndome ? " ( 272 ) . Although unfinished , the page is dense and full . It is not the poet/artist who inscribes her image on the page , but God who , from within the text , is the agent of action . The female speaker is the passive target of his His quest and therefore the submissive recipient of his love ; and poetry is the site of their encounter . <p> The poetry the human poet writes belongs to this world , but there exists a higher , supernatural poetry that transcends the material world . This absolute poetry is a dialogue that needs no words : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The dialogues maintained with God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eterno " to which the poet aspires . The poet yearns for the moment when the communication between her and her god , achieved through verbal connections , will be surpassed by a spiritual union of essences that transcends the temporality of words . In this way , the written poetry becomes a preliminary step in the mystic path . <p> After her return to Spain in 1972 , Champourcn 's poetry becomes somber , anguished , and pessimistic in response to her confrontation with the hostile and alienating world of the city . But even before this change in residence , there are indications that words fail to yield fruitful results . Near the end of Cartas cerradas , the poet writes : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Previously , Champourcn turned her sights toward the moment of eternal union with God when " sobrarn los sonidos , " but in this poem she presupposes God may not even receive her words . Although God 's presence may be waning , writing still serves a therapeutic purpose . It is a means of release from the psychic fatigue caused by her long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disguised and pain can no longer be overlooked . The placement of the word " another " at the beginning of the poem and its consecutive repetition in the third stanza underscore the futility of words without her divine interlocutor . These sober lines also contain a new metaphorical configuration for the act of writing . No longer lines or scars sketched on a blank sheet of paper , words are seeds sown in the furrows that paper represents . Instead of a void awaiting the masterful poet 's pen , paper is a potentially fertile entity capable of accepting or rejecting words . Within this scheme , the poet is not a generator of poetry who creates ex nihilo , but a tiller of a ground whose potential for fruition exists independently of the poet 's ability to plant seeds . Nevertheless , to the end of her religious poetry , the act of writing constitutes a bridge to her ultimate destination-God . <p> After her return to Spain , Champourcn enters what Joy Landeira designates as her retrospective period . The poet shifts her focus from the harmonious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of the city populated by amorphous humanity . The image of the wall in the title of her 1984 collection , La pared transparente , symbolizes not only the oppressive quality of her new social milieu but also the alienating effects of the spiritual isolation the poet suffers . The intimacy and bonding formerly established through words has been destroyed . The poet 's words now crash into a whitewashed wall : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> An element of marginalization , exclusion , and failure not seen in Champourcn 's previous poetry surfaces in the works she wrote after returning to Madrid . In the 1950s , although her poetry was incompatible with the discourse of the social poets , she successfully withdrew into the language of the spirit where she could maintain peace-inducing dialogues . In the 1980s , her clash is not with a poetic mode dealing in ugliness but with the aggressive force of the dehumanizing repercussion of her whole social reality . Faced with her inability to communicate with the world around her and forgoing her interchange with God , Champourcn finds the ultimate avenue to transcendence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> For the octogenarian , in a life that bears the weight of deep sadness , frustrated hope , and lost dreams , only poetry persists in its pristine state . As if in postscript to her life and works , in a poem entitled " Poema pstumo " from her 1988 collection , Huyeron todas las islas , she celebrates poetry as the ultimate incarnation of her existence ( past , present , and future ) , as the property of the heart and the provider of secret pleasure . <p> In her last book of poetry , Del vaco y sus dones , published in 1993 , Champourcn articulates her ulltimate desire : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> She longs not for knowledge or fantasy , but for imagination-for creativity and poetry . In this way poetry becomes synonymous not only with self-affirmation in the material world , but also with the perpetuation of the human spirit in the eternal one . She still evokes the name of the master poet Juan Ramn , whom she characterizes as " ebriedad de palabras . " Poetry is rapture : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry are all united by words , by names , and by indelible imprints . In Del vaco y sus dones , Champourcn speaks of memory but always from the perspective of joy . She also speaks of loneliness , silence , and nothingness , but always with a sense of hope . The material world is no longer a concern . With the eyes of the soul , the poetic speaker now sees inner landscapes full of light and indications of eternity . As Luzmara Jimnez Faro observes , the poet knows that life is fleeting , but she embraces it without anguish and welcomes it as transformation and a " camino hacia la luz " ( 22 ) . The void exists ; but writing , understood in its broadest sense of serf-awareness , serf-renewal , or self-affirmation , fills the gap of nothingness . In the poem entitled " Carta vaco , " Champourcn affirms : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Life and poetry are a process that signifies continuation , advancement , and survival . <p> Over her long career of nearly seventy years , Champourcn 's basic beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the poetic impulse . Although responsive at first , in the twenties and thirties , to poetic traditions and contemporary trends , Champourcn stood apart from her surrounding literary world . This intellectual and circumstantial consistency notwithstanding , her poetic persona evolves over time from a youthful emotional being who looked to the past for poetic inspiration to a maturing adult who grappled with the aesthetic dimensions of poetry within a present framework and finally to a woman who , withdrawing from exterior reality , pursued atemporal transcendence through poetry . In the epilogue to the plot unfolding in Champourcn 's opus , the poet found in poetry the antidote to solitude and despair and the confirmation of eternity . <p> The figure of the poet in her first book , En silencio . , waits , in a state of passive reception , for the vague imprints of previous poets upon her poetic receptacle . From 1928 to 1936 , her poetic speaker takes a more active stance before the poetic task and becomes a self-asserting subject capable of transforming herself as well as the beloved . Poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new realities and struggles to forge satisfying representations . The freedom and adventure that characterized the vanguard mode of the literature of the period also her infused poetry with a sense of faith in the artistic creativity of the woman as poet . The poet inscribed in Champourcn 's texts published between 1958 and 1972 no longer makes poems ; she uses them as conduits to self-realization on a higher plane than human love . Defined as a dialogue with God , poetry becomes a process of communication in which the poetic voice is the addresser and the poem is the message . Through her words , the speaker projects herself beyond her own person in the hope of achieving transcendence . The human speaker initiates the communicative process , but she no longer exhibits the creative control she did earlier . Her poem/prayers are devotional offerings awaiting the response of the ultimate addressee . In this way , the act of writing poetry is a metaphor for the life of the religious person-an existence motivated by the needs of the faith of the addresser but dependent on the benevolence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life itself becomes poetry-memories of the past , the joy of existence , and a light projected onto the ineffable cosmos . <p> In Champourcn 's process of becoming as artist , a woman , and a religious being , poetry remained the site of interchange-with other poets , with her beloved , with God , and always with herself . The specific function of poetry changed over time as the poet 's aesthetic disposition varied , but poetry was always the vehicle for her never-ending search for own identity , love , and transcendence . Champourcn shied way from elaborating a theory of poetry , but her poems speak for themselves . She could not have continued to publish for sixty-seven years if poetry were not only a powerful force that inspired her , as she claimed , but also one she harnessed and mastered .
