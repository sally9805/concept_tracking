In a quest to let skis carve ever more cleanly , ski and binding companies have joined forces in recent years to develop numerous integrated " systems " skis and bindings engineered to function in concert with one another ( ski A works only with binding B , and vice versa ) . Now systems are so ubiquitous that you might believe the good old days of putting your favorite binding on your favorite ski are over . That 's not the case . Discriminating skiers can still buy bindings a la carte , mixing and matching unaligned companies to build a custom setup . To find the best , we tested eight bindings that can be mounted on any flat ski . Some come with damping plates , some with simple lifters , but most incorporate the same free-flexing technology as their systemized brethren . Since performance differences between bindings are often subtle , we reduced the variables by mounting the test bindings on versatile Rossignol Bandit B2 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved to be.SAM BASS ATOMIC NEOX EBM $1,099 DIN 4-12 ; atomicsnow.com The Neox EBM features an onboard computer that runs a , and service needs . Beneath the flamboyant tech , though , the Neox is built on a free-floating chassis that allows toe- and heelpieces to shift fore and aft on a track as the ski is arced . Do n't have a spare grand ? The Neox 412 ( $299 ) is the exact same binding , just without the electronics . GRIPES : The steep price . And the preproduction models we tested were heavy . PROPS : All that heft busts through crud . The free-floating toe and heel produced a steady , even flex , and the LCD diagnosis was cool , too . LINE REACTOR 12 $399 DIN 4-12 ; lineskis.com The Reactor is the only binding that provides true lateral ( side-to-side ) release in the heel as well as the toe ( most bindings only offer lateral toe release ) potentially thwarting ACL injuries in backward-twisting falls . A rigid aluminum " Suspension Frame " beneath the toe- and heelpieces isolates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrations . GRIPES : Since the center mounting point is the only solid contact between binding and ski , it was tough to transfer energy to the tip and tailmuting edging sensations and making it difficult to initiate ( or finish ) carved turns . PROPS : Testers were easily able to pressure the ski 's centera trait well suited for park-and-pipe play . LOOK PIVOT 12 TI LIFTER $335 DIN 3.5-12 ; dynastar.com Look 's trademark lever-and-turntable heel returns this season unchanged . The heelpiece allows for a shorter mounting zone ( with screws underfoot , not behind ) , so the ski 's natural flex is less disrupted . Have n't skied Look in a while ? The heelpiece now automatically re-centers itself after release , so you do n't need to straighten it manually to step in ( remember the old Looks ? ) . GRIPES : Step-in felt mushy compared with the satisfying clicks of other test bindings . PROPS : The heelpiece 's titanium stirrup surrounds the boot heel , promoting heightened energy transfer and edge sensitivity . Plastic lifter plates beneath heel and toe provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 10 mm under the toe ) . MARKER TITANIUM 13.0 PISTON CONTROL TURBO $425 DIN 4-13 ; markerusa.com Marker 's " Piston Control " system quiets the ski during a turn 's counterflex , or unweighting , phase . When the ski is unweighted , a metal piston is slowly released from an oil-filled cartridge set into the platemetering the ski 's rebound and reducing chatter . For ' ' 04- ' ' 05 , Marker adds " Turbo , " a metal band that extends three inches beyond the toepiece and is fastened by a screw through the ski 's top sheet . Turbo gives the binding a bigger footprint on the ski , allowing the hydraulics to start working sooner in the turn . GRIPES : Less-powerful skiers may prefer a stepped-down version ; this model stiffened the B2 significantly . PROPS : Our testers were unanimous : The technology really works . Initiation was immediate , carve was clean and powerful , rebound was smooth and measured . ROSSIGNOL AXIAL 140 T-PLATE S $369 ( ' ' 03- ' ' 04 GRAPHICS PICTURED ) DIN 5-14 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll notice similarities between the two . Like the Look , the Axial 140 T-Plate S also has the advantages of a shorter mounting zone and an automatically re-centering heel . The differences ? A higher DIN range and a plate that gives you more stack-height than Look does : 10 mm of lift in the heel , and slightly more in the toe . GRIPES : Same step-in feeling as the Looka bit mushy . PROPS : The T-Plate has rubber-like padding beneath the heel to damp vibration , which makes for a slightly quieter ride than the Look 's . SALOMON S912 TI $330 DIN 4-12 ; salomonsports.com The S912 Ti construction is identical to Salomon 's World Cup race bindings ( minus the high-tension springs ) , but its titanium-alloy housing lightens the load for those of us with less-than-World-Cup leg strength . The toepiece incorporates " Spheric Oversize " technology : an antifriction unit designed to provide consistent release , regardless of how you fall . GRIPES : Instant , uninhibited power transfer made the ski feel jumpy . A plate might mellow its twitchiness and help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock-solid edge grip and a very responsive feel . TYROLIA HD 14 RAILFLEX $340 DIN 4-14 ; tyrolia.com As the ski flexes , the HD 14 's toe- and heelpieces glide along the Railflex plate , allowing fluid arcs . Like Line 's true lateral heel release , the HD 14 lets your heel escape sidewaysbut first the heelpiece must be forced upward a few millimeters , so it 's less of a factor during backward falls . GRIPES : The heelpiece 's diagonal-release action of the heelpiece can make it difficult to step into on steep slopes ; it tends to lurch to the side if you do n't step directly down . PROPS : Ultraprecise energy transmission and superb edge control . The step-in click was the most confidence-inspiring of the lot . And fore-to-aft stance position can be changed instantly according to skier preference . VIST V614 Sl UNIQUE $449 ( Stars-and-Stripes graphic pictured ) DIN 6-14 ; vist.it Though new to the binding market , VIST is no stranger to producing race-caliber equipment . The Italian company builds most of the plates used on the World Cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beefy , race-worthy " Speedlock " plate made of polyethylene and anodized aluminum . They 're removed with the flick of a lever , providing several fore and aft stance options and a unique theft-deterrent : Just toss a toepiece in your pocket before heading to lunch . GRIPES : It 's weighty17 grams heavier than the Atomic . Takes lots of power to drive it . PROPS : The plate damps vibration and distributes power evenly along the full length of the ski . And all that heft lets the ski charge like a tank through cruddy snow . Illustration COLOR PHOTO EIGHT COLOR PHOTOS : HEATHER MACARTHUR // <p>
