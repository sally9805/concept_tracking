<p> I wrote a throw-away line in a Navy-Maryland football column last week , using a cliched hillbilly stereotype to depict West Virginia football fans . Juvenile college friends thought it was hilarious ; gauging by the deluge of e-mails , an entire state did not . In hindsight , it was a needless , insensitive characterization . And for that I apologize . <p> The lesson was particularly poignant for me , learning how easy it is to become attached to assumptions about cultural identity , how comfortable it is to paint people the way I see them rather than how they see themselves . <p> Which brings me to the Washington Redskins and every other professional franchise or school vowing to never retire their American Indian names , logos and mascots , to make things right with a culture and a people . <p> As you 're drinking out of your Redskins mug Monday night while wearing your Redskins T-shirt  --  supporting your make-believe Indians against those reviled Cowboys  --  think long and hard about what a sweet way to " honor " a people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're paying homage to the bravery and warrior mentality of the Native American . " That 's the same tired excuse Florida State University uses to continue the tradition of a student on horseback in full Hollywood regalia , chucking a flaming spear into the ground at midfield before football games , while thousands of people participate in the Tomahawk chop and the accompanying war chant also popular at Atlanta Braves games . The truth : The indigenous people of this continent were almost all hunters , gatherers , craftsmen and craftswomen before some of our ancestors nearly exterminated them and turned them into B-western caricatures . <p> I have been wanting to write about this issue since I got this job 18 months ago . The boss told me to hold out before I alienated most of the city , their pigmented Indian-face flags flopping along the Beltway on the way to FedEx Field on a September morning . All those liberal crusaders in the District and suburban Washington , working and writing for their own passionate causes but pleading ignorance on this one . <p> So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgmental , figuring I was just some knee-jerk newcomer who did n't get it . <p> I still do n't get it . <p> Why , whether you 're black or white , Hispanic or Asian , whether you 're well off or getting by on public assistance , on the left or on the right , is most everyone okay with the term " Redskin ? " Why am I still waiting for Daniel Snyder to understand that if his team 's logo featured Mandingo tribesmen or orthodox Hasidics , it would be labeled racist and anti-Semitic ? <p> The most disturbing part is , the Redskins annually present data rationalizing their callous insistence on keeping the name , putting poll numbers to support their cause in their own news releases , as if to say , " See , we have Indian friends . " On Page 272 of the team 's media guide , readers are even given a Reader 's Digest version of where the term came from . " The term redskin . . . was inspired not by their natural complexion but by their fondness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name in 1933 from the late owner George Preston Marshall . He wanted to pay tribute to the Indian ancestry of his coach at the time , William " Lone Star " Dietz . But a revealing story published two weeks ago in the Baltimore Sun , which focuses on new research by a California multicultural studies professor , discredits Dietz . Turns out he was a white man " who began taking on an Indian identity as a teenager and ultimately seized the past of a vanished Lakota tribesman and made it his own . " The coach was convicted of misrepresenting his identity on military draft documents . So there was no American Indian for which the team was named , just a perpetuated stereotype of the time . <p> If the term " Redskins " was first used in the late 1580s , as the team says , it was also used when Europeans introduced commercial scalping to North America . Ask Suzan Harjo , the Cheyenne and Muskogee writer who is the lead plaintiff in a trademark lawsuit against the team dating from 1992 . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much more disturbing historical description than the one the team wants you to believe : <p> " When they started paying bounties for Indian bodies and Indian skulls as proof of an Indian kill , the trappers and mercenaries would come in with wagons full of men , women and children 's bodies and with gunny sacks of heads . It became a transportation and storage problem , so bounty payers began to pay for scalps in lieu of skulls and bloody red skins in lieu of bodies . " <p> I recently asked some of the Redskin players how they felt about the name . " It 's hard for me to understand because our people were n't treated like that , " said Joe Salave'a , whose ethnicity is Samoan . " But if that 's how American Indians feel , it 's something that needs to be dealt with . " <p> " I understand the people who may have those complaints , " said Ray Brown , the team 's 42-year-old offensive lineman , who is black . " If I can assist them in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , modest act of sensitivity , Brown tries not to refer to the team name in conversation . " I do n't tell people I play for the Redskins , " he said . " I just tell them I play for the ' Skins . When I sign autograph items , I do the same thing . I put ' Skins . It 's my thing . I 'm not saying everyone else should do it , but that 's what I do . " <p> Chad Morton , the former Washington kick returner who signed with the New York Giants this month , remembered seeing all the anti-nickname protesters before a team banquet in Virginia . <p> " I use to look at them and think , ' Why do n't you guys do something else with your time ? ' " he said last year . " Now I look at them and think they 're right . I mean , if you look at that logo and you really think about the name , it is racist . " <p> In July , Native American groups won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the team . Last month , the team and the NFL filed a motion to rehear that decision . <p> You know how Snyder feels about the controversy ? Ask his spokesman , Karl Swanson . " I know a guy who wants to paint the Redskins logo on the bottom of his swimming pool , " Swanson said on a recent voice mail . " So he clearly has no problem there . " <p> Do n't they realize some folks feel the same way about the Confederate flag , the way others used to feel about Amos and Andy , about putting on black face ? Until time told them they were wrong , that they should have known better . <p> I asked Swanson again to clarify the team 's position over the phone on Monday . He said the team researched it , that neither he nor Snyder is responsible for the meanings and usage that came afterward . So , Swanson was asked , if the team were called the Washington Negroes or the D.C. Rabbis , there would be no public outrage . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I understand the logo is undeniably a cultural symbol to thousands . <p> When parents buy their children bedspreads and rain ponchos with the team 's insignia on it  --  as Snyder 's parents did for him  --  it becomes part of your life experience , a piece of personal history . <p> But it 's not your history . It 's not your cultural symbol . It never was . You co-opted it , seized someone else 's identity and made it part of your own . When Native people try to explain that , you should listen  --  just as you would listen when a black person tells you they do n't appreciate the term " colored , " just as you would listen when a well-educated person from Morgantown tells you it 's no longer funny  --  it never was  --  to paint West Virginians as toothless , moonshine-sipping hayseeds.
