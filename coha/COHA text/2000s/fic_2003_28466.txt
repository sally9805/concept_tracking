Chapter One Sweet Wind , Wild Wind by Elizabeth Lowell Relax , Lara Chandler told herself silently . Carson has never set foot on the Chandler homestead - and he never will . He hates even the thought of you . You 're safe here . As Lara heard her own thoughts , she smiled ruefully . She really did n't need to worry about running into Carson Blackridge , on or off the small piece of land that was surrounded by the Rocking B 's lush range . Carson had made it very plain the last time he was with Lara that he had seen more than enough of her . Even years afterward the memory of the moment when she had offered herself and he had turned away made her blush and then pale . She had tried to exorcise the memory , but she had failed . Every time a man had done more than hold her hand or kiss her gently , the memory rose , freezing her . Lara forced herself to take one deep breath , then another , trying to shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had agreed to return to the Rocking B to write an informal history of a century of life on a Montana cattle ranch . With hands that trembled , she turned toward her suitcase , opened it and began to unpack with the efficient motions of someone accustomed to shuttling between two homes . At least , normally Lara was efficient . Today her fingers seemed numb . The third time she dropped the mascara applicator that she rarely used on her thick black eyelashes , she made an exasperated sound . It had been four years since that humiliating incident with Carson . She should have gotten over it by now . But she had n't . Four years was n't long enough . She came from a long line of people for whom the past was very much a part of the present . Nor was there a safe place in the future for her to hide from the past . Whether she liked it or not , the past would always be there , all around her , inside her . She had grown up listening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a century before . As a child , the years separating her from the past had seemed insurmountable , a barrier as high as the glacier-carved mountains that surrounded and defined the ranch itself . As she grew up , the years shrank until they became as understandable , and almost as tangible , as the progression of the seasons . Finally Lara had come to love the turning and returning of the years , grandparents seeing the faces of the past reborn in their grandchildren , the family stories told and retold until they became an informal history . She loved the larger human history as well , history written across the land itself , the extended family of mankind with its own rituals , its own unique patterns of disappointments and dreams passed from generation to generation . History was a living part of Lara 's personal life , and the Blackridges ' Rocking B ranch was the center of it . She had n't " agreed " to come back to do research so much as she had been compelled by her own needs . Lara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked around the room that her great-grandfather had built for the birth of his first child . To Jedediah Chandler , a free hundred-year lease must have seemed like a permanent grant . A homestead , not a leasehold . Yet in the end the land was only leased from the Blackridge family , not owned by the Chandlers , and the lease had expired two years ago . Larry Blackridge had extended the lease for the lifetime of Cheyenne Chandler , Lara 's grandfather . But Cheyenne was gone , and the homestead had passed into Blackridge hands . No more Chandlers would live in the expanded , often-repaired and much-loved family home that lay in the center of the Black-ridges ' Rocking B ranch . The name of the little valley would go on , however , passed from generation to generation as stories were told about the past . It had been called the Chandler homestead for the past century . It would be called that in a hundred years . The names of Blackridge and Chandler had become part of the Montana landscape itself . Which meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chandler , no matter how hard she tried to ignore him , especially there in the midst of the Rocking B. Every time she turned around , she would think of him , remember him , remember what he had done to her . He was part of her personal history - in many ways , the most important part . " Fine , " Laura muttered to herself . " So write a paper about Carson and file it under M for Mistake . Or Miserable . Misogynist , how about that ? " She sighed and gave up trying to characterize Carson in a single polite word . It would have been easier to forget him if he had made her unhappy while they were together . He had n't . Having him close , seeing his rare smiles come more frequently while he was with her , talking with him , touching him , laughing with him ... Miserable ? Hardly . For a few short months she had lived in the center of rainbows , and sunlight had been a river of gold pouring into her outstretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clipped tone . " Pigs flew then , too . Remember ? " Swiftly she emptied the suitcase , wondering with every movement if she had made a mistake coming back . There was nothing to tie her to the Rocking B but memories and a history that had no place for her . Her grandfather was dead . Her mother was dead . And the man who had never called her daughter was also dead . Lara 's hands hesitated as she remembered the call that had come to her aunt 's house two months before . She had answered the phone . Carson 's deep , gritty voice had told her that Larry Blackridge was dead . Hearing Carson 's voice again after four years had been like being dropped into fire . She had barely heard the words he was saying for the sudden roar of blood in her ears . And then the words had penetrated . The man who had adopted Carson and never called him son , the man who had fathered Lara and never called her daughter , the man her mother had loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To this day Lara did n't remember what she had said to Carson , or if she had said anything at all . Her next memory was of standing in the thin March twilight staring at the phone in her hand . A wailing sound was coming from the receiver . For an instant she had wondered if the phone were mourning her dead father . Finally she realized that she had simply kept the phone off the hook too long . ( Continues ... )
