Section : AUTOMOTIVE ENGINES Forget the black soot and smoke . Modern diesel-powered cars are quiet , clean and fast . <p> You would expect the 6-cylinder engine in the Mercedes E-Class and the V8 in the BMW 7 Series to he so smooth and quiet from the driver 's seat that you 'd have to look at their tachometers to be sure that they were running . You would not expect that of a diesel , however . Yet these are diesel engines . <p> The world has been looking to gas electric hybrids and fuel cells for future fuel efficiency . However , studies show that the diespl can equal or beat what the fuel cell might possibly deliver , and be within a gnat 's whisker of a gasoline hybrid like the Prius . The studies of total energy consumption - so-called well-to-wheel studies - were conducted by General Motors , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) and the University of Alberta in Canada . The MIT researchers , looking ahead to 2020 , found the diesel well ahead of most hydrogen fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To demonstrate the diesel 's acceptability , the Chrysler Group and Mercedes-Benz plan to join the only current diesel passenger-car importer , Volkswagen , with new models of their own . As of now . only the VW Jetta/Golf/Beetle 1.9-liter 4-cylinder turbocharged direct injection ( TDI ) is sold in the States . VW also will bring a more advanced 2.0-liter for the Passat , and probably a 5.0 V10 that develops 303 hp and 550 ft. - lb. of torque for its new Touareg SUV . <p> These new diesels will be sold next year in test quantities . That means just a few thousand each of the Jeep Liberty 2.8 Four and the Mercedes E-Class with a 3.2-liter inline Six . As we go to press , there has been no decision by Ford about its diesel Focus BMW 's 4.0-liter V8 is not coming here soon . A Primer <p> A diesel has no spark plugs . It has a very high compression ratio - about twice that of a gasoline engine . So the compression stroke builds up tremendous heat and pressure . A readily combustible fuel is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unlike a gasoline engine with a throttle plate to regulate airflow , the diesel is unthrottled . It craws in all the air it can , all the time , without wasting energy pulling air past a partly closed throttle . Performance is determined ( within combustion limits ) by the amount of fuel injected , so the diesel can produce a great deal of torque at low rpm . Step on the accelerator and a variable turbocharge : adds still mere air . the injectors spray more fuel , and the diesel develops tree-stump-pulling torque before the tach hits two grand . A gasoline engine needs an air-fuel mixture of about 15:1 . The diesel can run on mixtures as lean as 100:1 . Still Stumbling <p> Despite current diesel technology , the engine 's future is cloudy . California emissions regulations prevent the sale of diesels there . In 2004 , the federal emissions standards for diesels get appreciably tougher . The limits on particulates ( soot particles ) and oxides of nitrogen ( NOsubX ) between 2004 and 2010 are very stringent , with the standard due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem is that the diesel 's high-temperature combustion produces a high level of NOsubX . Effectively reducing both particulates and NOsubX requires after treatment in the exhaust . However , much of the hardware necessary for diesel after treatment is still in the early stages of development . <p> Another problem facing the diesel car is the quality of diesel fuel . Refiners concentrate on high-octane gasoline , and diesel fuel is produced from what crude oil is left . " We have the worst diesel fuel in the world , " says Chrysler Vice President Bernard Robertson . Diesel engines need fuel with a high cetane rating , the opposite of octane , for quick starts and continuing combustion . European cetane is in the low 50s , while U.S. cetane is barely over 40 . This affects every aspect of the way a diesel engine is tuned and makes for slower starts - and increases emissions . <p> Sulfur in fuel helps lubricate a fuel system 's moving parts , but it produces malodorous exhaust . And at current levels it 's totally incompatible with the needed exhaust after-treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content - from an average of over 300 parts per million ( ppm ) to 15 ppm in 2006-2007 . New Tricks For An Old Dog <p> The key to diesel performance is the fuel-injection system . VW currently uses a high-pressure mechanical fuel system with two pulses per injection . Future systems will rely on electronically controlled pulsing of high-pressure injectors . The solenoid-type fuel injector can provide up to five pulses per injection . The piezoelectric injector can provide up to 10 . <p> At the heart of most new systems is the Bosch-invented " common rail . " It has a high-pressure pump feeding a pipe-shaped accumulator . That means at any engine speed , every injector gets the same maximum pressure . Today that 's up to about 26,000 psi , from Bosch , with 30,000 psi coming . The higher the pressure , the smaller the injector nozzle openings can be , producing smaller pulses that provide better fuel atomization . Combine that with more frequent , strategically timed pulses during each compression-stroke injection , and the result is more complete combustion . <p> Despite five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different Bosch fuel-injection system - the electronically controlled unit pump-injector with one unit for each cylinder . Its tuning capabilities are comparable to the common rail 's and it develops slightly higher peak pressure . But a common rail for all cylinders has greater potential for consistency . <p> High-tech diesels start instantly if warm , and in about 2 seconds at subzero temperatures . New glow plugs from Bosch reach 2200 F in under 2 seconds , so the minute or so of preheating diesels in cold weather is but a memory . On The Way Out <p> Not only are diesel hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions low , but there 's an excess of air in the exhaust that could improve operation of an oxidationtype catalytic converter . Particulate aftertreatments that work best at this time are traps that fill up and have to be regenerated periodically . When the trap is restricted ( after intervals as short as 100 miles ) , a small quantity of fuel is injected to raise the trap temperature to as high as 1100F , incinerating the soot in about 15 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> PSA Peugeot Citron injects a cerium solution that reduces incineration temperatures , saving fuel . But , the solution eventually is depleted and must be replenished . GM is testing catalytic coatings that would last the life of the car , Smith says . <p> However , NOsupX remains the bigger problem , as the 3-way catalysts used in gasoline engines wo n't work in diesels . Exhaust-gas recirculation ( EGR ) , with a cooler in its circuit to lower exhaust temperatures , helps a lot by reducing the peak temperatures at which NOsubX is formed . Calibration tweaks of the fuel system and turbocharger , and reshaping the intake port and combustion chamber to promote a smoother burn pattern , also are expected to help . <p> There are two exhaust system aftertreatments in development to handle NOsubX . Both have been used successfully for industrial applications . However , the automotive environment is more problematic . <p> One system is called selective catalvtic reduction ( SCR ) treatment . This uses an injection of a solution containing urea , a readily available ammonia-based compound . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SCR reduces NOsubX to nitrogen and water without hurting fuel economy . <p> Another possibility is a NOsubX adsorber , also called the " lean NOsubX trap . " The gases adhere to the surface of the adsorber as a nitrate . When the trap is " filled , " fuel is injected . This promotes a catalytic action , converting the nitrate to nitrogen and water . <p> " Well-to-wheel studies have shown diesels to use less total energy than fuel cells .

It 's A Diesel <p> The Lotus Elise-based Opel ECO-Speedster is the poster child for General Motors ' diesel possibilities . Thanks to an ultrathin , carbon-fiber body , the ECO-Soeedster weighs just 1455 pounds . Its coefficient of drag is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from automakers , this one is a diesel . Power comes from the world 's smallest mass-produced 1251cc , and boasting a variable-geometry turbo and a common rail injection system , the Four produces 110 hp and 148 ft. - lb. of torque . The engine is mated to a 5-speed Easytronic shift-by-wire transmission . <p> Driving on public roads around Opel 's Dudenhofen proving grounds , the ECO-Speedster reveals precious little outward visibility , little forward resistance and no wind noise at all . What it showed on the test track was startling performance : 0 to 100 kph ( 62 mph ) was reached in only 8.8 seconds . Top speed was 256.739 kph ( 159.53 mph ) . Even more impressive than the car 's willingness to go quickly is its unwillingness to drink fuel . We recorded 92.6 mpg . Small wonder that this small wonder of a diesel now owns 17 world records . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Matt Davis <p>
