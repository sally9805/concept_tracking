<p> Former executives of Custer Battles - an American firm accused of stealing millions from Iraq reconstruction projects and banned from further government contracts - have continued doing contracting work and have formed new companies to bid on such projects , The Associated Press has learned . <p> This may or may not be illegal , military officials say ; Custer Battles officials deny any wrongdoing . <p> The new companies ( there are at least three ) are all headed by Rob Roy Trumble , who previously was operations chief for Custer Battles , according to state records . <p> The fledgling firms have different names but all are housed in the same office as Custer Battles - Suite 100 on Hammerlund Way in Middletown , R.I. , 3,000 square feet on the ground floor of a squat building in an industrial park . <p> Meanwhile , Custer Battles ' former chief financial officer Joseph Morris , accused of submitting fake invoices to the government , has been working for another American contractor in Iraq , according to interviews . <p> The military was not aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Pentagon official said , speaking only on condition of anonymity . Military investigators would have to decide whether these actions violate the suspension order . <p> Morris did not return phone messages or e-mail sent to his company and private addresses . <p> By itself , Custer Battles is already in a great deal of trouble . It is under investigation by the Pentagon for allegedly cheating the U.S. government out of tens of millions during the chaotic months following the Iraq invasion . In September 2004 , the military banned Custer Battles and 15 of its subsidiaries and officials , including Morris , from obtaining government contracts while the criminal probe proceeds . <p> Custer Battles employees have also been accused of firing on unarmed Iraqi civilians , of using fake offshore companies to pad invoices by as much as 400 percent , and of using forgery and fraud to bilk the American government . Two former associates have filed a federal whistle-blower suit , accusing top managers of swindling at least $50 million . <p> Former Army Rangers Mike Battles and Scott Custer formed a limited liability corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a GOP campaign contributor and a former CIA case worker , ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2002 as a Rhode Island Republican . <p> The actions of Morris , their chief financial officer , were among the worst , according to the military 's suspension order and the federal lawsuit . The order cites " serious improper conduct " by Morris which required immediate suspension , so he could not be " awarded new public contracts in Iraq and elsewhere . " <p> But Morris has worked on subsequent reconstruction contracts , for an American firm called Sallyport Global Holdings . Executive John DeBlasio said Morris worked as a contracts consultant " off and on , " for the past six months . " We employed him for that , for his expertise , " DeBlasio said . " He 's got a lot of knowledge about Iraq . " <p> He did n't know Morris had been suspended , DeBlasio said . <p> DeBlasio is a former adviser to the Coalition Provisional Authority , which ran Iraq and awarded reconstruction contracts for 13 months following the country 's invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The suspension order , and the ongoing criminal investigation , have been reported for months in the national and international media . The government maintains a Web site that lists all parties banned from contracting work . <p> After DeBlasio talked with the AP , a lawyer representing Sallyport e-mailed the AP saying Morris had signed a one-year contract with Sallyport in April 2004 , before the suspension order was issued , and that work already underway was exempt . <p> " All government contracts that Mr. Morris had any involvement in while under contract with Sallyport were in effect prior to Mr. Morris being placed on the ( suspension ) list , " wrote Washington , D.C. attorney David Cohen . Sallyport will not renew Morris ' contract , Cohen said . <p> But a subcontractor now working in Iraq said Morris was a project manager for Sallyport from May until October , when word got out about his military suspension , and that Morris was involved with new contracts after his suspension . <p> " I asked him about it because I saw his name on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a former Custer Battles midlevel manager who says he quit more than a year ago after becoming exasperated with management practices . " He told me he was a federal witness and had been exonerated . " <p> According to federal regulations , individuals suspended by the military are banned from acting as principals on subsequent government contracts . Principals are defined as " officers , directors , owners , partners , and persons having primary management or supervisory responsibilities . " Whether Morris ' position was equivalent to those descriptions would have to be determined by military investigators . <p> Rob Roy Trumble , the former Custer Battles executive who heads the new companies , is not on the suspension list . <p> It is not a simple thing to track the ownership of two of his businesses , Emergent Business Services and Tarheel Training LLC . <p> They are affiliated with a Romanian company called Danubia Global Inc . Danubia , in turn , is owned by Security Ventures International Ltd. , a British Virgin Islands firm , according to Bucharest incorporation records . Trumble cut short an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no idea " who owned Danubia . The web sites of his new companies are linked to Danubia 's . Emergent 's site says it is Danubia 's employment recruiter and lists several contracting jobs open in Iraq . <p> Battles and Custer , through a spokesman , said they sold the remaining Iraqi assets of Custer Battles - including vehicles , computers and intellectual properties - to Danubia early this year . Several former Custer Battles employees have joined the Romanian firm . But the contractors refused to name the employees , or to identify Danubia 's owners . <p> Trumble said his new companies " have nothing to do with Custer Battles " - though they share the same office . A Custer Battles e-mail , obtained by the AP , shows the recipient was instructed in January to send future Internet correspondence to Emergent , though the phone number and street address remained the same . <p> Emergent has bid on at least one government contract , according to federal records . <p> Tarheel Training was the name of North Carolina business development proposed by Custer Battles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facility fell through amid growing controversy surrounding the contractor . That same month , Tarheel Training LLC was incorporated in Delaware and North Carolina with Trumble listed as manager . <p> Trumble denied he was the manager of Tarheel and said the 5-month-old company was going out of business because " they have n't been able to sign any contracts . " <p> But the company 's web site says the firm is more than a year old and has attracted more than 100 customers . <p> " We 've been working with the specialists in Emergent Business Services for well over a year and they have provided comprehensive , professional services , " says the web site , quoting Tarheel Chief Executive Officer Jack Donovan . <p> Donovan is a retired military colonel who told a North Carolina newspaper in November that Scott Custer " was one of my best soldiers . I got him a commission . " He also is a former Custer Battles official . <p> " They 're like mushrooms , they just keep sprouting up , " said Franklin Willis , a former CPA official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Battles had defied government control and did what it wanted in Iraq . <p> " They are extremely clever . They are extremely brazen . They 've never let truth get in the way of their economic ambitions . " <p> Associated Press writers Michelle R.
