Welcome Banquet <p> As Jeremy turned the car off the main highway from Waterford and onto the narrow gravel road that wound through the leafy wood encircling the Bergstrom estate , Anna instinctively clutched her seat cushion with one hand and braced herself against the dashboard with the other . " Maybe when we 're finished remodeling the kitchen , " she said , voice shaking with each bump and jolt , " we can convince Sylvia to do something about this road . " <p> Jeremy kept his eyes on the winding way that led into the forest ; if a car approached from the opposite direction , he would have to react quickly and pull halfway off the road to avoid a collision . Both sides of his car were already marked with fine scratches from past diversions into the underbrush . " I doubt it , " he replied , his wire-rimmed glasses sliding down his nose a millimeter or two with every pothole . " Sylvia 's a traditionalist . The longer you know her , the more you 'll realize that she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " She 's letting me make big changes to the kitchen , " Anna reminded him . <p> Jeremy shrugged and offered her his familiar cheerful , crooked grin . " Only because she did n't think you 'd take the job otherwise . " <p> As much as Anna was thrilled with her new position as Elm Creek Manor 's chef , she had to admit that Sylvia had guessed correctly . She would never forget her first glimpse of the kitchen when she had come to the manor for her job interview . It was larger than she expected to find in a building constructed in 1858 , but there was not a single appliance post-1945 except for a tiny microwave on the counter , possibly the first ever invented by the look of it . The pantry was spacious and well stocked , but poorly lit and so badly organized that it would have taken Anna longer to find ingredients for one of her signature dishes than to mix them together . And as for the cooking utensils left to soak in the sink ... The whisk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't have bothered her had it not been bent out of shape , and the hand mixer had rust , actual rust , on the handle . How the Elm Creek Quilters had managed to feed fifty-plus people three meals a day with that four-burner gas stove was a mystery , but Anna knew that she could n't work in such conditions , not after being spoiled by the sparkling clean , modern facilities at Waterford College . Fortunately Sylvia had agreed that the kitchen was long overdue for an upgrade , and she had accepted Anna 's condition for taking the job . <p> Now that Elm Creek Quilt Camp had ended for the season , Sylvia and Anna would launch the remodeling process in earnest . With weeks of planning and hours of consultation behind them , in two days they would usher in a team of workmen to tear out old cupboards and haul away dilapidated appliances , to demolish the wall between the kitchen and the west sitting room , to install new wiring , lighting , shelving , appliances , and everything else Anna desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , Anna would have a fully operational , professional kitchen in time for the holiday feasts she intended to prepare for her new colleagues . <p> She hoped , in time , that they would become her friends . <p> Late-morning sunlight broke through the leafy wood , gold and rust and scarlet with autumn , as the road forked , wound through the trees , and emerged beside a sunlit apple orchard . They passed a red barn , climbed a low hill , and crossed the bridge over Elm Creek . All at once the manor came into view  --  three stories of gray stone and dark wood surrounded by autumnal beauty . <p> Anna knew the Elm Creek Quilters considered the grand manor a second home . She was an Elm Creek Quilter now , too , she reminded herself . Perhaps in time Elm Creek Manor would become as important to her as it was to her new coworkers . <p> On the other side of the creek , the road broadened into a parking lot that circled two towering elms . " Call me when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered as he parked near the foot of the back stairs . <p> " I can take the bus , " Anna said . She could n't help feeling as if she were imposing on his generosity . It was one thing for him to drive her to work when his girlfriend , Summer , had lived at the manor , but now that Summer was attending graduate school in Chicago , Jeremy had no reason to come so far out of his way . Anna and Jeremy were friends and neighbors , with apartments on opposite sides of the hall in a building not far from the Waterford College campus , but these almost daily drives were a lot to ask even of a friend . But every time Anna mentioned the bus , Jeremy shook his head and drove her anyway . Anna suspected that Summer had asked him to bring her since she was new , to help her feel less like an outsider . Or maybe the Elm Creek Quilters were afraid that she would grow tired of the long walk from the bus stop , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't wear out her shoes . Or maybe Jeremy was just a nice guy and she was taking advantage of him . <p> Whatever the reason , and despite the occasional pang of guilt , secretly Anna was glad that their carpooling had not ended with Summer 's departure . The bus 's circuitous route would have added two hours to her daily commute , and she would have missed Jeremy 's company . <p> " I 'll have my cell on , " Jeremy said , as if she had not mentioned the bus this time , either . Surely Summer had asked him to babysit her . That had to be it . <p> Anna returned Jeremy 's grin , waved good-bye , and climbed the four stone steps to the back door of Elm Creek Manor . The kitchen was through the first doorway on the left , and from within came the sound of someone clattering pots and pans and what sounded like cookie sheets . <p> Anna hung her jacket in the hall closet and entered the kitchen , which already seemed strangely bare with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it missing . Clad in a burgundy cardigan and black slacks , her silver-gray hair held back in a tortoise-shell comb , Sylvia Bergstrom Compson , Master Quilter and founder of Elm Creek Quilts , sat cross-legged on the floor , transferring skillets and saucepans into a carton . She glanced up and smiled , feathery lines etched around her eyes and mouth deepening , but the fondness in her expression did not lessen her air of command , as if she were a woman who was accustomed to voicing her opinions and having others carefully listen . <p> " Matt and Andrew moved the table and benches into the dining room , out of the way , " Sylvia said , answering Anna 's unspoken question . Brushing dust from her hands , she rose , far more slender than Anna and nearly as tall , with only the slightest stoop to her shoulders . A pair of glasses hung around her neck on a silver chain . " I have n't decided what to do with them yet . They 'll seem out of place in our new kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long I ca n't bear to get rid of them . " <p> " I 'm sure we can find a place for them somewhere , " said Anna . " We do n't have to get rid of everything , not if it 's useful or has sentimental value . " " <p> You 're thinking just like my Bergstrom ancestors , " said Sylvia dryly . " Remind me to show you the attic someday . No , we ca n't keep everything . That 's the whole point of our work today , is n't it , to clear out the old and make way for the new ? " <p> Anna hesitated . " I thought we were just going to pack up the dishes and cookware and move everything out of the way before the contractor demolishes the cabinets . I assumed we 'd put everything back afterward . " <p> " And spoil your lovely new kitchen with rusty old pots and pans ? " Sylvia shook her head . " Out of the question . " <p> " Sometimes old pots cook better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cookware she had long admired . She was itching to cook up a ratatouille in the Dutch oven that had belonged to Sylvia 's great-aunt . " Let 's not discard things arbitrarily just because they clash with the paint and granite . " <p> Sylvia smiled , amused by Anna 's reference to their many contentious debates with their contractor 's designer , who held strong opinions about the merits of particular color combinations . " Agreed . If I want to toss something out but you want to keep it , I 'll let you have the last word . This kitchen will be your workspace , after all . " <p> " But it 's more than that , " Anna said . " A kitchen is the heart of a home . Think of how much time the Elm Creek Quilters spend in this room , discussing quilt patterns and lesson plans over coffee and cake . Your guests , too . In the few weeks I 've been here , I 've noticed that time and time again , quilt campers find their way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sylvia said . " More so than ever since you came on board . " <p> " It 's also the first room campers pass when they come through the back door , " Anna added , " and except for registration morning , that 's the door they use most frequently . " <p> Sylvia nodded , thoughtful . " It never occurred to me , but perhaps the kitchen is just as important as the front foyer is for offering our guests a warm welcome to the manor . " <p> In Anna 's opinion , the kitchen played that role in every home . " We could always move the registration tables in here , " she joked as she knelt beside a lower cabinet . Inside she found cake pans of all shapes and sizes , definitely worth keeping . She pulled over an empty carton and carefully stacked the pans within it . <p> " Even after we knock out the wall and expand into the sitting room , we wo n't have enough space for that , " said Sylvia . " Our campers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an official greeting from your kitchen . " <p> The Welcome Banquet : the eagerly anticipated commencement of each new week of camp . The banquet hall , transformed by white linen tablecloths , crystal , and candlelight , set the proper festive tone for the days ahead , a week devoted to learning , sharing , and enjoying a respite from the cares of ordinary life . Anna had prepared the delicious feast for the last few weeks of the camp season , and she had been delighted by the campers ' rave reviews  --  not to mention those of the Elm Creek Quilters . She was pleased to know that she played such an important role in creating a celebratory mood and a sense of anticipation for the week ahead . <p> But many quilt campers found their way to the kitchen before they sat down to supper in the banquet hall . <p> " The kitchen has to be a welcoming place for our campers , " Anna mused , sitting back on her heels and forgetting the bakeware for a moment . <p> " It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give campers a place to relax with a cup of coffee or a snack , or if they just want a cozy place to chat with friends . You might find yourself entertaining an audience while you prepare meals . I hope you wo n't mind . " <p> " Not at all . It would be fun , like having my own cooking show . " Anna drew her long , dark brown French braid over her shoulder , tucked a few loose strands back into the plait , and tightened the band on the end . " But that makes it even more important to create an inviting atmosphere , do n't you think ? Cozy seats , coffee , and snacks are n't enough . We need to find a way to make this kitchen serve up the spirit of Elm Creek Quilts just as it serves delicious meals . Somehow  --  and I do n't know how yet  --  we have to give our guests a sense of the history of the manor as well as its exciting present . I want to honor the traditions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elm Creek Quilters and campers alike , who make Elm Creek Quilt Camp such a unique place . I want to bring all those flavors together , right here in this room . " <p> Sylvia regarded Anna over the rims of her glasses for a moment . When a smile quirked in the corners of Sylvia 's mouth , Anna knew her new employer was pleased with her ideas , but also amused that she hoped for so much from a simple kitchen . " That 's a tall order , " said Sylvia , brushing crumbs from a dented muffin tin . <p> " I 've trained in some of the finest kitchens in Pennsylvania , under some of the most demanding chefs you 'd ever meet , " Anna replied . " I know how to fill a tall order . " <p> Sylvia smiled . " Spoken like a true Elm Creek Quilter . " <p> Anna fervently hoped so . She did n't feel like one , not quite yet , and she wanted to , more than anything .
