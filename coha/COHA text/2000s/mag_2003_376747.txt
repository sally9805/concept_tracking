The latest edition of Al Gore endorsed Howard Dean for President last week . This surprised a lot of people , including me . But Gore 6.0 seems more radical than previous models , with a passion upgrade from the glitches in 5.0 ( clumsy populist presidential candidate ) , 4.0 ( clumsy earth-toned presidential candidate ) , 3.0 ( loyal Vice President ) and 2.0 ( militant New Democratic candidate for President in 1988 ) . Watching Gore and Dean together on the podium  --  twins in dark blue suits and light blue ties , Gore in populist growl-shout mode , complete with intermittent Southern accent  --  I realized the utter logic of the move . The two have so much in common . They 're the angriest guys in the Democratic Party . The Bush re-election campaign website already features an anti-Dean video titled When Angry Democrats Attack . <P> Dean and Gore are angry in different ways , though . Gore 's anger is personal . He is angry at Bill Clinton ( yes , for Monica Lewinsky but also for being such an impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hillary Clinton since 1993 , when the elected Vice President found himself competing with the unelected Vice President for Bill Clinton 's attention . He is angry with Joe Lieberman  --  and with the moderate Democratic Leadership Council  --  for criticizing the " people vs. the powerful " theme of his 2000 campaign . He and Dick Gephardt have always been bitter rivals . And he probably does n't like John Kerry or Wes Clark very much either . <P> This is not to say Gore 's motivation for the endorsement was entirely negative : he clearly admires Dean 's brand of anger . And , yes , they do have similar positions on the war . Gore also loves Dean 's consultant-free iconoclasm , the legions of fanatic computer geeks , the sheer energy of the campaign ( as opposed to the careful , soporific , consultant-laden nature of Gore 's candidacy ) . For a guy who has spent his life smack-dab in the Washington establishment , the endorsement firmly , and finally , establishes Gore as an outsider . <P> Dean 's anger is tactical , not visceral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is by far the best politician among the 2004 Democrats  --  which is one reason Republicans should postpone the champagne if Dean wins the nomination . The doctor diagnosed the Democratic electorate before any of his opponents did , and he shaped his candidacy to fit the mood , which was , in a word , ballistic . Furthermore , Dean understood that party activists were not just angry at George W. Bush ; they were furious with the Democrats in Washington who were letting a minority-elected President have his way at every turn . Dean 's prescience  --  and Gore 's presence  --  has created a formidable candidacy and , quite possibly , a potent new strain of liberalism that may supplant the traditional Old and New wings of the party . Let 's call the Dean-Gore faction the New-New Democrats . <P> Both Dean and Gore were outspoken last week about the need to remake the Democratic Party . ( When Hillary Clinton was asked if the party needed to be remade , she responded with one word : " No . " ) " The party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained Joe Trippi , Dean 's campaign manager . " It 's been a long time since Democrats were totally shut out of the government . We do n't know how to be a true opposition party  --  to do the sort of guerrilla warfare that Newt Gingrich did . "
