Mark Merliss took college-prep courses at an outstanding urban high school , in a state admired for its top-notch public schools . He was accepted at four colleges including his first choice , the University of Connecticut , where classmates come from elite private schools . <p> Yet when the lanky 18-year-old from Meriden arrived on campus last fall , he felt shaky . His high school senior year English was heavy doses of reading but little writing , he said . He still struggled getting his ideas down . " I 'll sit for a half hour thinking of a word ... I knew what I wanted to say , but I did n't know how to say it . " <p> Eager to succeed - Merliss plans a career in golf course management - he was relieved to find English 104 , " Basic Writing . " <p> It 's remedial , though that word does not appear in the catalogue . Like its companion , Math 101 , English 104 is for undergraduates smart enough but not quite ready for the University of Connecticut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' This is a big place , " Merliss said , brown eyes shining , his 6-foot-2 inches sprawled amid the cramped bunk bed , books and electronic gear crowding his dorm room . " I did n't want to be lost . " <p> Students like Mark Merliss were on the mind of new U.S. Education Secretary Rod Paige , his second week on the job . In a speech to leaders of private colleges , the former Houston schools superintendent assailed America 's public schools for sending students to college unprepared . <p> Noting nearly a third of college freshmen need remedial work , Paige said , " College students should be taking college courses , not remedial classes . " <p> Debate has swirled in recent years around the issue of remedial college courses . This may intensify with the Bush administration 's stated intention of improving the nation 's public schools . <p> It 's already a quandary for college administrators and policy makers , as the children of baby boomers swell enrollment , as the necessity of a college degree heightens , as colleges accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully prepared . <p> The term " remedial " carries a stigma , and so some schools use terms like " developmental " or " compensatory , " if they name the classes at all . <p> And students admitted to the most competitive schools may need extra prepping when they arrive . <p> The Massachusetts Institute of Technology offers a voluntary physics course , 801-L , for new students wishing to boost their math fluency to keep up with quick calculations in lectures . <p> At MIT 's neighbor in Cambridge , Mass. , all Harvard College freshmen take a writing course , Expository 20 . For those not completely ready , there 's Expos 10 , a voluntary , introductory version . <p> " It is in no way remedial , " insisted Nancy Sommers , director of Harvard 's writing program . Every year , Expos 10 is taken by about 100 of the incoming 1,650 freshmen , the enrollment determined by a writing test everyone takes the first week . <p> " You 're expected to hit the ground running here , " Sommers said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had opportunities to write as much . " <p> Not everyone thinks remedial courses signify a problem . <p> " It 's unreasonable to think everybody is college-ready , just because they finished high school , " said Hunter Boylan , head of the National Center for Developmental Education in Boone , N.C. <p> " I 'm not one to blame the public schools , " said Boylan , also a professor of higher education at Appalachian State University . " We take in tens of millions of children every year with a huge diversity in talents and backgrounds , and schools are expected to kick them out 12 years later , college-ready . " <p> Students like Mark Merliss comprise a sizable minority . A federal survey in fall 1995 , the latest available , found 29 percent of first-time college freshmen enrolled in remedial courses . <p> While the largest percentage of remedial students - 41 percent - were at two-year schools , 22 percent of freshmen at four-year public institutions and 13 percent at private four-year colleges required such academic grooming , the survey found . Math is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by composition and reading . <p> The survey also found roughly three-fourths of remedial students successfully finished those courses , and most as freshmen . <p> A new survey is under way this fall , with results due early next year . <p> Colleges differ in the readiness they require , and how they gauge it . <p> The University of Connecticut requires English 104 for students who score below 431 on the verbal portion of the SAT admission exam . It 's optional for those who scored 431-540 . ( Merliss said he scored around 500 . ) <p> As taught this semester by instructor Will Eggers , the basic writing course is about the same as English 105 , the standard composition course . Students analyze literature and learn to hone their views in writing , including the art of revision . <p> Incoming UConn freshmen also take a " Q " test . It measures readiness for required courses demanding quantitative skill , such as chemistry or statistics . Those who fail , must take Math 101 , intermediate algebra . ( Merliss passed the " Q. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top quarter of their high school class . This fall , 2,850 freshmen came to the Storrs campus . Enrollment in English 104 this school year is 329 , while 371 students enrolled in Math 101 . <p> Remedial education , by any name , has a long history . <p> A hundred years ago , 60 percent of college students took math and English prep courses , Boylan said . It was college , not high school , that groomed students for higher education . <p> After World War II , young veterans filling colleges on the GI Bill needed refresher courses . <p> The next big surge was their children , the baby boomers , breaking barriers of class and race getting into college and some in need of basics they had never received . <p> All this was fairly routine until the push for K-12 assessment tests arrived in the early 1980s . <p> " There 's this myth that huge numbers of unprepared students have descended on higher education in the last decades , " Boylan said . " The fact is no one had bothered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count , two of the largest , most open university systems became lightning rods for those who say remedial classes have no place on a college campus . <p> The City University of New York is phasing out remedial courses in its bachelor degree programs serving more than 128,000 students . They will be no more in fall 2001 . <p> The California State University system , with some 220,000 full-time undergraduates , decreed in fall 1998 that freshmen who fail its remedial courses must leave and get basics they need at a community college . <p> The Cal State system has identified 300 high schools that send it the most deficient students ; with $17 million in state funds , it is working to get those numbers down , deploying student tutors to those schools , sending college faculty to work with teachers and making clear how prepared students must be . <p> The University of Connecticut may also look to public schools to reduce the need for catch-up work in college . One proposal : Give high schools a report card on how many unprepared students they send UConn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well , said Susan Steele , vice provost for undergraduate education and instruction at all six UConn campuses . While students must apply themselves , she said , " there is a real question about what is our obligation to our students if we 've admitted them , to make sure that they 're successful . " <p> After just three sessions , Mark Merliss said he already felt sturdier since taking Will Eggers ' English 104 . <p> " He makes us think , not like my teachers in high school . He not only teaches us , he guides us , " Merliss said . With his first assignment , he found , " words were popping into my head .
