<p> In March , Alicia Parlette , a Chronicle copy editor , learned she has a rare form of cancer spreading from her right hip . As she continues treatment with the drug interferon , the 24-year-old mourns the death of a friend from cancer while continuing to deal with her mother 's death in 2002 . . <p> CHAPTER 15 <p> I got an e-mail the evening of Sunday , Dec. 18 . It said my friend Benny Estacio from church was dead . <p> Benny was 67 when he learned that he had colon cancer in February 2005 , a month before doctors told me I had a rare cancer , alveolar soft part sarcoma . We had forged a strange-yet-precious relationship : two church members going through cancer , two people dealing with life , two children just leaning on our God . <p> The most immediate memory I had of Benny was from a healing service our church had in mid- October . That night , surrounded by our families , Benny and I held hands and walked to the altar together to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When I read the e-mail , my first response was anger . Why this ? Why Benny ? Why a week before Christmas ? <p> Why did God have to take the one person who I felt was walking with me through this ? Who knew the fears and the hopes that lurk in the heart of a cancer patient  --  the one person whom I felt I connected with , equally , wholly . <p> Most of all , Benny 's death scared me . If he and I were on this weird cancer journey together , what did it say about my journey if his had ended ? It seemed all signs were pointing toward death by cancer : It killed my mom , it killed my young cousin , and now my fighting buddy , too . I was screwed . <p> Benny would probably tell me that he was much older . At the healing service , he had looked into my sad , scared eyes and told me , as a fellow fighter , that I would be OK , that he could see so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry that I did n't get to spend more of that time fighting with him . <p> To comfort myself , I tried to think of all the people I know who have survived cancer , but for some reason that was n't really helping . Benny was dead . <p> I sat on BART going to Concord about 5 p.m. on Thursday , Dec. 22 . We had just come out of the Transbay Tube . The sky was dark and murky with fog and the tiny reflections of streetlights . I was thinking about Christmastime , about my mom 's absence , about Benny 's death . And then a Death Cab for Cutie song that I 'd never listened to came on my iPod : <p> " And it came to me then that every plan <p> is a tiny prayer to Father Time <p> as I stared at my shoes in the ICU <p> that reeked of piss and 409 . ... <p> And I knew that you were a truth I would rather lose <p> than to have never lain beside at all <p> and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the TV entertained itself . ' Cause there 's no comfort in the waiting room , <p> just nervous pacers bracing for bad news . <p> Then the nurse comes ' round and everyone lift their heads , <p> but I 'm thinking of what Sarah said : <p> that love is watching someone die . <p> So who 's gon na watch you die ? <p> So who 's gon na watch you die ? <p> So who 's gon na watch you die ? " <p> It hurt , listening to that , reliving the fear and the final grief that came to me as I ran down the hall at Sutter Health in Roseville as my mom took her last breath nearly four years ago . I wanted to ask my dad what it was like , holding her hand as she left our world . I ca n't think of anything harder , more grief-filled and more painfully beautiful . <p> I wondered if my dad would have to relive that with me . I actually felt a little jealous of my parents ' relationship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through all the joys and tough moments , the tenderness of life . I knew that my dad would go through all the medical drama again with me in a heartbeat ; I know he loves me that much . And I know that I have so many people who love me . <p> But part of me still wanted that one special person  --  that one who was so desperately in love with me that he would hold my hand . Through anything . <p> On Christmas Eve , my brother , Matthew ; my friend Kate ; and I drove to our church in Granite Bay . My dad was already there to sing in the choir , and as we walked in 20 minutes early for the 9 p.m. service , the sanctuary was almost full . <p> As we sat through the service , I thought about the downs of the past year . I had lost control of my body ; I had felt romantic heartbreak ; I continued to desperately miss my mom . I had felt incomplete , unsuccessful and condemned . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 11 years ; I looked over at Matthew , whom I want to protect more than anything else ; I watched my dad sing from the choir loft ; and I listened to Pastor John talk about how Christ was born today , in the here and now , because he loves us . <p> In the sanctuary of my home church , I felt all those imperfections and insecurities slip away . I come home , I come to this sanctuary , because these people heal me . <p> Right then  --  on my favorite day of the year , as the candlelight illuminated so many faces I love as we sang " Silent Night "  --  that 's all the healing I needed . <p> On Thursday , Dec. 29 , I met with my therapist , Dr. Debra Marks . We talked about my Christmas , about how it was without my mom . We talked a lot about Benny 's funeral , which was the day before . <p> I had gone alone . Even though I arrived early , only a few seats were left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 100 people standing . I sat near the back and was hit with so , so much sadness . Benny was gone . It was painfully unfair ; I could feel my heart clench as I thought about his wife , his kids , his grandchildren . How could God let him leave them ? <p> In the middle of all of those people , I felt so lonely , as if it were just me and Benny on the planet and now Benny was gone . I looked around and saw my brother 's friend , Todd , in the back of the room . I walked over to him and mouthed , " I need a Todd hug " ; my crying was so consuming I could n't speak . He held me for a minute or two as I sobbed on his shoulder . Finally , a connection . Grief is so much more bearable when it 's shared . <p> I sat back down and looked around some more . I was reminded of my mom 's funeral , with a line out the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my funeral would be like : How many people would be there ? What would they be thinking ? When would this funeral be ? <p> I scanned the program . The first two songs were " How Great Thou Art " and " Here I Am , Lord , " my mom 's favorite hymns . We sang " How Great Thou Art " at her funeral . Are all funerals the same rehashing of memories and songs and Bible verses ? <p> I wanted my funeral to be different . I wanted it to be quirky and youthful and completely specific to me . I wanted songs from Jimmy Eat World ; I wanted Ani DiFranco 's version of " Amazing Grace " ; I wanted passages to be read from " To Kill a Mockingbird " and Anne Lamott and some of my writing . <p> I floated in and out of these thoughts throughout Benny 's funeral , between the reality of his death and the possibility of mine . <p> I told Dr. Marks some of this , and then she asked me about heaven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the biggest element to me is that it 's filled with all our loved ones who have died . Like , for me , I imagine my mom and my grandparents and my cousins Jerilyn and Fred and my good friend Joyce just hanging around , waiting for me to join their party . If dying means being able to see my mom again , I wo n't be as scared ; I 'll even look forward to it . <p> Dr. Marks asked if I thought my mom could communicate with me now ; I said yes . I told her that I had felt her presence on several occasions , but one in particular gave me the chills : <p> It was my college graduation . I was in the journalism building at the University of Nevada in Reno , standing in my cap and gown on the steps in the atrium , surrounded by my graduation class . My dad and brother had gone to get seats , but my mom 's best friend , Pat , had stayed to watch me get my picture taken with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak to us about our time in the J school . But instead of starting out with anecdotes about our classes or our projects , he told a story . <p> He said that there was someone in our class who had lost someone dear to them a couple of years before . He told us that the person who had died had called him the night before . She told him that she was proud and that she would be at the ceremony that day . <p> By that point the tears were streaming down my face . I remember a friend put her hand on my shoulder and kept saying , " Oh , ' Leesh " between gasps . <p> Finally , our professor said , " Oh , and she wanted me to tell you pink and white . Pink and white . " <p> I looked over at Pat to see if she knew what that meant . She stared back at me ... wearing an outfit of pink and white . We looked at each other , my mouth gaping , hers slowly smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me through Pat . <p> As I finished telling this to Dr. Marks , I refocused on her . Specifically , her clothes . She was wearing a white shirt and a pink sweater . My arms tingled as I said , " And , actually , as I 'm telling you this , I 'm noticing that you 're , uh ... you 're wearing pink and white . " <p> She looked down , opened her mouth , then smiled . <p> " It 's interesting , of all the times you could have told me that story , that you tell me on the day I 'm wearing pink and white . " <p> I took it as a sign that my mom was in the room , that we were surrounded by her love and her presence  --  so much so that it spilled into our conversation . <p> I left Dr. Marks ' office feeling happy , loved and invigorated . My mom 's presence was real . You ca n't fake coincidences like that ; plus , I do n't believe in coincidences . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street , thinking , " My mom is here . My mom is here . " On California Street , between Scott and Pierce , there 's a square of sidewalk in which someone wrote " I love you anyway . " I walk by it every time I go to therapy , and I always stop and touch it . I skipped up to it , sat down and put my hands on the letters , and just stayed there , thinking of her . <p> RESOURCES <p> Of 1.3 million new cancer cases diagnosed in the United States each year , fewer than 200 are alveolar soft part sarcoma , or ASPS .
