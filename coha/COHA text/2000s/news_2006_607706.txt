<p> Tommy Stratchko plays first base and designated hitter for Coppin State University in Baltimore . His twin brother , Bernie , plays third base for the University of Maryland-Eastern Shore . <p> Three years ago , when their mother Norma first heard the acronym HBCU , she had to ask what it meant . Today , when the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference  --  a collection of historically black colleges and universities  --  begins its baseball tournament in Norfolk , Norma Stratchko and her husband will be in the stands and their sons will face each other on the field . <p> That two white twin brothers from La Plata would be starters for a pair of predominantly black schools is hardly even noteworthy in black college baseball circles . Only one of the MEAC 's seven baseball teams had a majority-black roster this season , and nearly half of the league 's players were white , according to interviews with coaches and sports information directors . At some historically black schools , the ratio of black players to white players is almost the exact opposite of the ratio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you saw these teams without their uniforms , you would n't even know they 're HBCU anymore , " said Claudell Clark , who played and now coaches at Norfolk State . " We 're just trying to recruit the best possible athlete we can get , white or black . We 're not necessarily concerned with that . " <p> The shrinking number of black baseball players is a much-noted trend that stretches across all levels of the game . Last season , 8.5 percent of Major League Baseball players were African American , down from 18 percent in 1991 , according to the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport . In the 2004 season , just 6 percent of Division I baseball players were black , according to an NCAA survey , compared with 58 percent of basketball players and 44 percent of football players . <p> But on campuses that are often 85 or 90 percent black , the MEAC 's baseball rosters are especially striking . At Coppin State , about half of the school 's 30 white male students play for the baseball team . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 30 Hispanic male students do the same . <p> Coaches at historically black schools tell stories of attending showcase events for high school seniors and seeing just four or five black faces among 200 prospects . At their schools , the situation is reversed ; white players on several MEAC teams said they 're often the only non-black students in their classes and are easily identified as baseball players merely by walking through campus . <p> " I look at the pictures on my wall ; when I started , the team was predominantly black and we had maybe one or two white kids , and you look at it 10 years later and it was split down the middle , " said Florida A &M; Coach Joe Durant , who has spent 15 years at the Tallahassee school . " You want to look for the African American kids first , because we 're a predominantly black university , but when you ca n't find ' em , you ca n't find ' em . . . . Coach Danny Price from Florida International , he looked at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got more white kids than I do . ' " <p> Whether this is even worth mentioning is a matter of some debate . White players , who in some cases have been asked repeatedly about their school choice by friends and media members , said their minority status is insignificant . <p> " Baseball is baseball no matter where you go , " said Bernie Stratchko , a phrase repeated by players of different races at different schools . <p> Administrators at several schools said the racial makeup of their teams is never discussed with coaches , that there are no racial quotas or goals and that coaches are merely expected to recruit athletes who are able to compete at the Division I level . <p> " We do n't play baseball because of color , " UMES acting athletic director Keith Davidson said . " We play baseball because in order to be a Division I program you have to have 14 sponsored sports , and baseball is one of the ones we chose to play . " <p> The MEAC 's seven baseball coaches said their most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they will continue to recruit the players most suited to that task  --  " black , white , blue , purple , " said Eastern-Shore Coach Bobby Rodriguez ; " black , white , green , orange , " echoed Delaware State Coach J.P . Blandin . <p> Coaches said parents are more likely to ask about campus life than players , but that racial issues are not central to the recruiting process . <p> " We 're trying to think of who can get the ball down to second or who can throw the ball over the outside third of the plate , " said North Carolina A &T; Coach Keith Shumate , who is white . " When we talk about white or black , we 're talking about parts of the plate we throw to or what uniform we 're going to wear . " <p> These schools often have small or nonexistent baseball recruiting budgets and scholarship allotments far below the NCAA maximum . Scholarship dollars last longer , the coaches explained , when divided among in-state players , regardless of race . They said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major league draft , and that less-polished players often choose to play other sports in college . <p> But some coaches also said they 're representing schools whose historical missions were tied to race , schools that in some cases have long traditions of producing black baseball players , and that they continue to search for black prospects . Major League Baseball stars Andre Dawson , Vince Coleman , Marquis Grissom and Hal McRae all came from MEAC schools , and the schools sent several players to the Negro leagues . <p> " I feel a calling to make sure we recruit black athletes , " said N.C. A &T's; Shumate , who coaches the only majority-black baseball team in the league . " Anytime you talk about race the least little thing can be twisted , and that 's why people do n't like to talk about it , but I 'm outspoken about it . . . . It 's about opportunity , and it 's about making sure these kids get opportunities just like the other kids do . " <p> Of the 23 schools in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historically black conferences that encompass the mid-Atlantic region  --  only 12 play baseball . The two local HBCU schools , Howard and Bowie State , both dropped the sport within the past five years . <p> When Terrance Whittle became the coach at Division II Elizabeth City State six years ago , the baseball team was mostly white . Whittle has since launched a concerted drive to recruit black players , and said his roster this season is about 75 percent black . <p> " For us it is an effort , a conscious effort to find and field the best black baseball players and to stay true to the historical mission and complexion of our schools , " he said . " The MEAC seems to have kind of gotten away from that mold of recruiting African American players , and the complexion of their rosters has changed . " <p> But Whittle acknowledged that , as a Division I conference , the MEAC faces different challenges . There are stricter eligibility requirements , and there are regular meetings with the biggest powers in the sport , heavyweights from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect of facing the best teams in the country is responsible for attracting many of the white players , who often said historically black schools offered their only chance to play Division I baseball . That 's what landed Tommy Stratchko at Coppin State , where he said being the only white kid in class has been " different from everything I 've ever experienced . " <p> The Baltimore school has just one student cafeteria and two dorms , and non-athletes agreed that it 's easy to pick out the baseball team around campus . <p> " I just started looking around , " junior Dunstan Cole said . " I said , ' Where are all these white boys coming from ? ' " <p> Cole and other Coppin students said they 're happy to have the best baseball team coaches can compile , and that in any case they rarely see the baseball players , who mostly live in off-campus apartments . <p> The baseball players also stick together around campus , but so too do athletes from other sports . Coppin State pitcher Alex Hangland joked he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted , and several teammates said they 've never spent time in a majority-black environment before baseball brought them to Baltimore . <p> Coppin State outfielder Ryan Deakyne , for example , went to high school and junior college in California ; both schools were overwhelmingly white . His friends asked him what it would be like at a predominantly black school and he said he did n't know . When he arrived on campus he ate meals by himself if he could n't find any teammates , and was intimidated by the idea of being the only white student in a classroom . <p> Now , he said , the idea of being intimidated by a majority-black class seems " ridiculous . " If he does n't see baseball players in the cafeteria , he sits with other students . Plus , he tasted gumbo for the first time and proudly tells of going to the D.C. club H2O this week for teammate Amiel Traynum 's 21st birthday . <p> Needing an English requirement this semester , Deakyne wound up being the only white student in a black literature class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated to participate in class discussions . But when a business professor asked students to design a marketing strategy for Coppin State , Deakyne decided not to include a racial component in his plan . <p> " I was sitting there and I was like , ' As a white guy , I would n't mind coming here if I lived in the city , ' " he said . " I did n't see it as an issue . "
