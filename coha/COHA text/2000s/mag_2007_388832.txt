Headnote SMALL SUVS VEHICLES IN THIS CLASS ARE GETTING LARGER , WITH SOME EVEN ADDING THIRD-ROW SEATS . Just as vehicles in other classes have grown in size and power over the past several years , so too have the models in this relatively young small SUV category . In 10 years , the class has evolved from just one vehicle , the four-cylinder , fivepassenger Toyota RAV4 , to a category with more than 20 offerings . Many models offer both four- and six-cylinder engines , and the redesigned RAV4 's optional third-row seat is no longer unique to this class . In fact , small SUVs have grown so much that the lines between them and midsized SUVs have become blurred . Improvements , additional features , and increased versatility can also mean higher prices , and these not-so-small SUVs can now approach or exceed $30,000 . This puts them very close to midsized SUVs not only in price but also in size , amenities , and power . In our February 2007 test of small SUVS , the redesigned Honda CR-V scored close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since that test , more models have entered the market . For this test we bought three redesigned , sevenpassenger small SUVs : the Hyundai Santa Fe , Mitsubishi Outlander , and Suzuki XL7 . We also added two fivepassenger models , the Dodge Nitro , which is based on the Jeep Liberty , and the Subaru Forester Sports XT , which shares the same turbocharged four-cylinder engine found in the sporty Impreza WRX . The redesigned Hyundai Santa Fe topped this group in our testing and is now ranked just below our top-rated RAV4 V6 . It 's quiet , comfortable riding , and it 's refined . It has a versatile interior , yet its exterior dimensions are modest . Handling is improved , and the 3.3-liter V6 is powerful and smooth.The interior has simple controls and impressive fit and finish . The optional third row seat is too small for adults . Our Limited AWD cost $30,745 with the optional third-row seat and sunroof . The high-end $27,662 Sports XT is the only Forester to currently offer electronic stability control . It is also quick and handles nimbly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail slide.The lack of available curtain air bags is a negative , and the snug interior lacks the ambience found in newer SUVs . Reliability of the Forester has been excellent . The previous Mitsubishi Outlander was dowdy but adequate ; this redesign is a major upgrade . The strong engine and new six-speed transmission make the new Outlander quicker , but without a big drop in overall fuel economy . Handling is improved , with better agility and steering , but ride comfort suffers a bit in return.The interior is a mixture of hard plastics and some flimsy materials , but they all fit together well . The third-row seat is snug and purely for children.With options such as heated leather seats , a sunroof , and an audio and navigation package , our XLS AWD rang in at $30,615 . Reliability is yet unknown . Suzuki abandoned the truck-based platform for the XL7 , using an extended Chevrolet Equinox platform for the redesigned car-based SUV . Unlike the base Equinox , the XL7 uses General Motors ' refined and powerful 3.6-liter V6 engine . However , fuel economy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit in the third-row seat . Handling is more responsive and the ride is more comfortable than the Equinox we tested for our February report , but by no means is the XL7 nimble . Our Luxury model , with the optional rear DVD system , cost $29,284 . Reliability of this new model is unknown . The new Dodge Nitro is long on aggressive looks but not much else . It has a noisy engine and a big thirst for fuel . Handling is ponderous , and the ride is uncomfortable . Interior materials are insubstantial , poorly constructed hard plastics.The narrow foot wells hurt the driving position , and the small windows and high belt line compromise visibility.The 4WD system is part-time and lacks a low-range setting for serious off-roading . The Nitro is too new for us to have reliability data for it . Our SLT part-time 4WD , with leather , heated seats , an audio upgrade , sunroof , and a towing package , came to $28,875 .

CR Quick Recommendations Small SUVs have become the alternative to station wagons and family sedans . They typically come with all-wheel drive , have roomy interiors , and offer cargo versatility . Most now have standard stability control . The Toyota RAV4 is our top-rated small SUV for its performance and versatility . The Honda CR-V is another good choice for its driving dynamics and overall competence . The Subaru Forester is still a sensible choice but is beginning to show its age . The Hyundai Tucson V6 is a good value , but it lacks agility and fuel economy falls short . For those interested in challenging off-roading or towing , the Nissan Xterra fits the bill . The Hyundai Santa Fe , Mitsubishi Outlander , and Suzuki XL7 score high enough , but we lack reliability data for their redesigns . The Ratings rank vehicles on how well they scored in our tests , regardless of price or reliability . Recommended models ( ) not only tested well but also have shown average or better reliability and performed at least adequately if crash-tested or included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially well in both IIHS tests and our accident- avoidance tests are designated with a .

It has responsive handling with a firm but comfortable ride.The 3.3-liter V6 is smooth , but fuel economy is disappointing ( a 2.7-liter V6 is standard ) . Reliability is not yet known . THE DRIVING EXPERIENCE The ride is compliant and steady , with restrained body motions . The cabin is quiet , with well-suppressed road and wind noise . Routine handling is more nimble and responsive than its predecessor 's but not as sporty as the Outlander 's . Steering is fairly quick but lightly weighted . At the track , the Santa Fe was reasonably quick in our avoidance maneuver , aided by well-calibrated standard stability control . The 242-horsepower , 3.3- liter V6 and five-speed automatic transmission make for a smooth and responsive powertrain , but we measured only 18 mpg overall .

Firm front seats provide good back support.The second row is roomy and comfortable for three passengers , but the cushion is too low for good thigh support.The third row is best for kids . Access to the front and second row is excellent through large door openings.Third-row access is tight past the flippedup second-row seats . Most controls are simple and well labeled , but the gauges lack daytime contrast . The cabin has moderate storage , and cargo capacity is 37.5 cubic feet with third- and second-row seatbacks folded .

LOWS Road noise , premium fuel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A former top pick , the Forester still does well in our Ratings . But this aging design has lacked stability control and curtain air bags . With a new Forester not due until 2009 , Subaru has added stability control to the XT Sports model . The Forester is quick and agile , particularly this turbocharged model . But the interior is plain and fairly noisy . Reliability has been excellent . THE DRIVING EXPERIENCE The XT rides firmly but is still comfortable . Road noise is very noticeable . Wider tires and a firmer suspension make the Sports XT slightly more agile than other Foresters , with slight body lean and good steering feel . But tire grip limited its avoidance-maneuver speed , and the stability control allowed too much tail slide before it kicked in . The smooth 224-horsepower , 2.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder provides acceleration matching many V6s .
