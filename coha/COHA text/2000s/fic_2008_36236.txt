I do not know how many hours or days I have lain on this cold , hard floor , waiting to die . For some time , it seemed certain that I already was dead , shrouded in the dark stillness of my grave , unable to move or speak . <p> A sharp pain shoots through my right side . It is not over . Sound comes back next in tiny waves : rats scratching inside the walls , water dripping beyond my reach . My head begins to throb against the icy concrete . <p> No , not dead . Not yet , but soon . I can take no more . In my mind I see the guard standing above me , an iron bar raised high above his head . My stomach twists . Did I talk ? No , a voice within me replies . You said nothing . You did well . The voice is male . Alek , or Jacob perhaps . Of course , it could be neither . Alek is dead , captured and shot by the Gestapo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emma did not make it across the border . <p> Emma . I can still see her face as she stood above me on the railway bridge . Her lips were cool on my cheek as she bent to kiss me goodbye . " God bless you , Marta . " Too weak to reply , I nodded , then watched as she ran to the far end of the bridge , disappearing into the darkness . <p> After she was gone , I looked down at the bridge . Beneath me a dark red stain seeped into the snow , growing even as I watched . Blood , I realized . My blood . Or maybe his . The Kommandant 's body lay motionless just a few meters away . His face looked peaceful , almost innocent , and for a moment I could understand how Emma might have cared for him . <p> But I had not ; I killed him . <p> My side began to burn white-hot where the bullet from the Kommandant 's gun had entered . In the distance , the sirens grew louder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rejecting her offer to help me escape . But I would have only slowed her down and we both would have been caught . This way she had a chance . Alek would have been proud of me . Jacob , too . For a moment I imagined that Jacob was standing over me , his brown hair lifted by the breeze . " Thank you , " he mouthed . Then he , too , was gone . <p> The Gestapo came then and I lay with my eyes closed , willing death to come quickly . For a moment , when they realized that I had shot the Kommandant , it seemed certain that they would kill me right there . But then one pointed out that bullets were scarce and not to be wasted , and another that I would be wanted for questioning . So instead I was lifted from the bridge . " She 'll wish we had killed her here , " one said as they threw me roughly into the back of a truck . <p> Remembering his words now , I shiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ago . Or even years ; time here blends together , endless days of loneliness , starvation and pain . The solitude is the hardest part . I have not seen another prisoner the whole time I have been here . Sometimes I lie close to the wall , thinking that I hear voices or breathing in the next cell . " Hello ? " I whisper , pressing my head against the crack where the wall meets the floor . But there is never any response . <p> When the footsteps in the corridor do come at last , I am always filled with dread . Is it the kitchen boy , who stares at me with dark , hollow eyes as he sets down the tray of moldy bread and brown water ? Or is it one of them ? The torture sessions come in sudden , unpredictable bursts , none for days or weeks , then several in rapid succession . They ask the same questions over again as they beat me : Who were you working for ? Who ordered you to shoot Kommandant Rich-walder ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise . But I have not spoken and they do not stop , not until I have passed out . Once or twice they have revived me and begun again . Most times , like today , I wake up back in my cell , alone . <p> Yet despite everything , I have said nothing . I have done well . I smile inwardly at this . Then my satisfaction disappears . I thought , almost hoped , that this last beating would mean the end . But I am alive , and so they will surely come again . I begin to tremble . Each time is worse than the last . I can not take any more . I must be dead before they come . <p> Another sharp pain shoots through my side . The Nazis operated on me shortly after I arrived at the prison , removing the bullet . At the time , I did n't understand why they would try to save me . Of course , that was before the interrogations began . The pain grows worse and I begin to sweat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness once more . <p> Sometime later , I awaken . The smell of my own waste hangs heavy in the air . In the distance , I hear a low , unfamiliar rumbling sound . Through my eyelids I sense light . How much time has passed ? I raise my hands to my face . My right eye is sealed shut by a fresh , round welt . I rub my left eye , brushing away the thick crust that has formed in the outside corner . Blinking , I look around the cell . The room is blurry , as everything has been since they confiscated my glasses upon arrival . I can make out a pale beam of daylight that has found its way in through the tiny , lone window by the ceiling , illuminating a small puddle on the floor . My parched throat aches . If only I could make it to the water . But I am still too weak to move . <p> The rumbling sound stops . I hear footsteps on the floor above , then on the stairwell . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key turns in the lock . The cell door opens and I can hear low male voices talking . I force myself to remain still , to not tremble or give any indication that I am awake . The footsteps grow louder as they cross the room . I brace myself , waiting for the rough grasp and blows that will surely come . But the men pause in the middle of the room , still talking . They seem to be having a disagreement of some sort . They are n't speaking German , I realize suddenly . I strain to listen . " too sick , " one of the voices says . The language is not Russian or Slavic at all . English ! My heart leaps . <p> " She must go . " I open my eye quickly.Two men in dark green uniforms stand in my cell . Are they British ? American ? I squint , trying without success to make out the flag on their sleeves . Have we been liberated ? <p> The shorter man has his back to me . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing toward the door . " She must go , " he repeats , his voice angry . The shorter man shakes his head . <p> I have to get their attention . I try to sit up , but the pain is too much . I take a deep breath and cough , then raise my arm slightly . The man who had been pointing looks in my direction . " See ? " he calls over his shoulder as he races toward me . The other man does not reply , but shakes his head and walks out of the cell . <p> The soldier kneels beside me . " Hello . " <p> I open my mouth to respond , but only a low gurgling sound comes out . " Shh . " He puts a finger to his lips . I nod slightly , feeling my cheeks redden . He reaches out to touch my arm . I jerk away . For so long , human contact has only meant pain . " It 's okay , " he says softly . He points to the flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He reaches out again , more slowly this time , and I force myself not to flinch as he lifts my arm , pressing his large , callused fingers against my wrist . I had nearly forgotten that a person could touch so gently . He feels for my pulse , then brings his other hand to my forehead . His brow furrows . He begins to speak quickly in English , his blue eyes darting back and forth . I shake my head slightly . I do not understand . He stops mid-sentence , a faint blush appearing in his pale cheeks . " Sorry . " <p> He pulls a metal bottle from his waistband and opens it , pouring some liquid into the cap . Then he takes one hand and places it behind my neck . I allow myself to relax against the warmth of his touch . His sleeve gives off an earthy scent that stirs a childhood memory , pine needles on the forest ground . He lifts my head slightly , cradling it as one might an infant 's , bringing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallow the water he pours into my mouth . It has a salty , slightly metallic taste , but I do not care . I drink all that is in the first cap and a second , too . <p> As I drink , I study his face . He is no more than a few years older than me , twenty-three or twenty-four at most . His dark hair is very short on the sides but wavy on top . Though his expression is serious now , the crinkles at the corners of his eyes make me think he has smiled a lot . He looks kind . And handsome . I am suddenly aware of my soiled prison dress and matted curls , caked thick with dirt and blood . <p> I take one last sip . Then , exhausted from the effort , I go limp as he gently lowers my head to the floor . Do n't , I want to say , as he slides his hand out from under my neck . His touch is familiar now , comforting . Instead I smile , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide and sad . I can feel him wondering how I have come to be here , who would do this to me . He starts to stand . Panicking , I struggle to reach up and grab his hand . <p> " It 's okay . " He kneels beside me once more , gesturing toward the door of the cell with his head . " Doctor . " He means to bring me help . I relax slightly , still clinging to him . " It 's okay , " he repeats slowly , squeezing my hand . " You will go . " Go . My eyes start to burn . The nightmare is over . It is almost too much to believe . A single tear rolls hot down my cheek . He reaches out to brush it away . <p> He clears his throat , then touches his chest with his free hand . " Paul . " <p> Paul . I stare up at him , repeating his name in my mind . I do not know if I can speak . But I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallow , then take a deep breath . " M-Marta , " I manage to say . Then , overwhelmed by the effort and all that has happened , I collapse into darkness once more . <p> " Awake now , are we ? " A woman 's voice , brisk and unfamiliar , cuts through the darkness . Have the Germans returned ? I inhale sharply . Something is different . The air is no longer thick with waste , but with smells of rubbing alcohol and fresh paint . Gone are the sounds of the rats and dripping water , too . They have been replaced by gentle rustling , voices talking softly . <p> Snapping my eyes open , I am stunned to discover that I am no longer in my cell , but in a large room with bright yellow walls . Where am I ? A woman stands by the foot of the bed . Though her face is blurry , I can see that she is wearing a white dress and cap . She comes up beside me and touches my forehead . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still pain in my side , but it is duller now , like a toothache . " My name is Dava . Do you know where you are ? " She is not speaking Polish , but I understand what she is saying . Yiddish , I realize . I have not heard it since leaving the ghetto . But Yiddish is so close to German , and the woman speaks it with some sort of an accent . Perhaps this is just another Nazi trick to get me to talk . The woman , seeming to notice my distress , quickly answers her own question . " You are in a camp run by the Allies for displaced persons , just outside Salzburg . " <p> Camp . Salzburg . My mind races . " Nazis ? " I manage to say . My throat aches as much from saying the word as from the effort of speaking . <p> " Gone . Hitler killed himself and what was left of the German army surrendered . The war in Europe is over . " She sounds so sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink in as she reaches above my head to a window and adjusts the curtains to block some of the sunlight that is streaming through . Do n't , I want to say . I have lived in darkness for so long . " There , that 's better . " I look up at her . Though her full figure gives her a matronly appearance , I can tell by her face that she is not more than thirty . A lock of brown hair peeks out from beneath her cap . <p> Dava pours water from a blue pitcher into a glass on the low table beside my bed . I start to sit up , but she presses against my shoulder with her free hand . " Wait . " She takes a pillow from the empty bed beside mine and , lifting me up slightly , places it atop the one already beneath my head . I notice then that I am wearing a hospital gown made of coarse , light-blue cotton . " Your body has been through a great deal . You need to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass to my lips . " Slowly , " she repeats . I take a small sip . " That 's good , Marta . " I look up , wondering how she knows my name . " It was written on your forehead when they brought you in , " she explains . Then , noticing my surprise , she adds , " The soldiers who are liberating the camps often write things , names or conditions directly on the patients . They either do n't have paper or they 're afraid the information would be lost on the way in . " <p> I take another sip , then lay my head down on the pillow once more . <p> Suddenly I remember the soldier helping me drink on the prison floor . " How did I get here ? " <p> Dava replaces the glass on the table . " The Americans found you in the Nazi prison when they liberated Dachau , just outside Munich . We 're just two hours south , not far from the German border , so many of the liberated are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in more than a week ago . Your wound was infected and you had a very high fever . We were n't sure if you were going to pull through . But you 're awake now , and the fever is gone . " Dava looks over her shoulder across the room , then turns back to me . " You rest for a few minutes . I 'm going to let the doctor know you 're awake . " <p> As she walks away , I lift my head again . Although my vision is blurry , I can make out two rows of narrow , evenly spaced beds running along the walls of the long , rectangular room . Mine is in the farthest corner , pressed against a wall on one side . All of the beds seem to be filled , except the one beside me . Several women dressed in white move briskly between them . <p> Dava returns a few minutes later carrying a tray , an older man with thick glasses in tow . He picks up my wrist with one hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaches for the corner of my gown . Surprised , I recoil . <p> Dava sets down the tray on the empty bed behind her and steps forward . " He just needs to examine the wound to make sure it is healing properly . " I relax slightly and let the doctor lift my gown , trying not to feel his cold , unfamiliar hands as they press on my stomach . Then he pulls the gown back farther , revealing the wound . I am surprised to see fresh stitches along the incision line . " They had to operate again when you first arrived here , " Dava explains . " There was a piece of bullet still inside you and you had developed an infection . " I nod . In prison I often wondered why my side still ached so long after the Nazis operated on me . Now , not long after the second surgery , it already feels much better . <p> The doctor replaces my gown and turns to Dava , speaking to her in German too brisk and accented for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're healing really well . And that you should try to eat something . Are you hungry ? " Before I can answer , Dava picks up a bowl from the tray behind her . " Soup , " she announces brightly . I sit up slowly and this time she does not stop me , but brings the bowl close under my chin . A rich aroma wafts upward . Nausea rises in me and a cold sweats break out on my forehead . Noticing , Dava sets the bowl down on the table and picks up a cup and saucer from the tray . " Let 's just start with some tea . " <p> I swallow , my stomach calmer now . " I can hold it . " <p> Dava hands me the cup and I take a sip . The liquid is lukewarm and soothing to my throat . Cradling the cup in both hands , I look upward . The ceiling is high and decorated with a pattern of some sort . I squint to try to make it out . <p> " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains . " The whole camp is housed on the grounds of Schloss Leopoldskron , which was one of the Hapsburg palaces . The Nazis confiscated it from its previous owners , and we took it from them . The palace is very beautiful , as are the grounds . I 'll give you a tour when you are well enough . " <p> " Thank you . " I take another sip of tea . <p> Dava points upward . " If you look there , you can see the Baroque influence . The detail is really quite extraordinary . " <p> " I ca n't " I begin , then hesitate . " That is , I ca n't see it . " <p> " What do you mean ? " Dava 's voice is heavy with concern . " Did the Nazis do something ? A blow to the head , perhaps ? Or did you fall ? " <p> I shake my head . " Nothing like that , " I reply quickly , though of course they had struck me in the head many times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And my glasses were confiscated when I was arrested . " <br> Continues ...
