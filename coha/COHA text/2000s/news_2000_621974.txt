<p> Bobbling along in a lake of hot oil , a platoon of half-cooked doughnuts makes the rounds of the Krispy Kreme doughnut machine . <p> Each day , in rows of six , hundreds of thousands of doughnuts spend exactly two minutes in the fryer , then undergo a dousing of liquid sugar glaze . <p> The result : 1.5-ounce rings of oil , sugar and flour that have appeared in more than 80 movies and television shows , from Rosie O'Donnell to " Primary Colors , " and attracted a cult following hundreds of miles from their Southern roots . <p> " These are the best little glazed doughnuts I 've ever had in my life , " said San Francisco resident Venetia Washington . " Whenever I visit my family in Alabama , I take an extra trunk to bring back Krispy Kremes . " <p> Starting next week , Washington will be able to get her fix closer to home . The Bay Area 's first Krispy Kreme shop opens Tuesday in the Union Landing Shopping Center , across from an Albertson 's supermarket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this summer , and the company is scouting for sites in San Francisco , the East Bay and elsewhere . <p> While not every doughnut lover warms up to Krispy Kremes , dozens of fans are expected to be in line at 5 a.m. to get the first Hot Original Glazed rings out of the Union City fryer . <p> Existing Bay Area doughnut shops , meanwhile , are wondering exactly how much of a bite Krispy Kreme will take out of the local doughnut , er , pie . <p> " We 're just a small family business , " said Rashpal Dhillon , manager of Dee 's Bakery &; Doughnut , an 11-year-old shop located about a mile from the Krispy Kreme . <p> Dee 's ca n't afford the staff to operate its fryer all day and serve doughnuts warm , Dhillon said . " Time will tell " what will happen when the Krispy Kreme opens , he said . <p> Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. , founded in Winston-Salem , N.C. , in the 1930s , sells a hefty dollop of nostalgia with its pastries . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Orange neon signs reading " Hot Doughnuts Now " glow from the windows , and the company loves to tout the " secret recipe " behind its signature Hot Original Glazed rings that Krispy Kreme founder Vernon Rudolph bought from a French chef in New Orleans in 1933 . <p> But Krispy Kreme is no mom-and-pop shop . The 144-store chain , which generated revenues of $220 million in 1999 , expects to net $52 million in an initial public offering next month , which will help grease its wheels of growth . <p> Krispy Kreme ( ticker : KREM ) is still in its " infancy , " according to papers filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission . Its goals are ambitious : It hopes to become " the recognized leader in every market we enter . " <p> Part of the dough from the IPO will be invested in franchise joint ventures like the one launching in the Bay Area , which eventually is expected to open about 25 stores . <p> Despite Krispy Kreme 's advantages , restaurant experts do n't expect the chain to dunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop , they 're a cult , " said Ron Paul , a consultant with Technomic Inc. , a Chicago firm . <p> Many of the chain 's customers drive miles specifically for Krispy Kremes . To maintain an aura of specialness , the company keeps a 10-mile cushion between stores . <p> " I do n't think they 're going to upset the competitive balance in new markets , " said Paul . " They 're still such a small player in the scheme of things . " <p> Washington , a customer service representative for the Internal Revenue Service , is a good example of the Krispy-Kreme-or-nothing customer . " I do n't eat doughnuts now because there are no good doughnuts around here , " she said . <p> While most doughnuts are cakey and thick , Krispy Kreme 's yeast-raised rings " are light and small , almost like a stick of butter melting in your mouth , " said Washington . <p> ( According to the Chronicle mail scale , a Krispy Kreme glazed ring 's 1.5 ounces compares to 2.4 ounces for its counterpart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glazed contains 170 calories and 10 grams of fat , Krispy Kreme says . ) <p> Washington plans to trek from San Francisco to Union City once or twice a week for Krispy Kremes . " That 's just a hop , skip and a jump on the San Mateo Bridge , not far at all to travel for something good , " she said . <p> Allison Wallach , doughnut category manager for industry-leader Dunkin ' Donuts , said Krispy Kreme 's entry into new markets " has helped our business . Because of the PR they put behind a new store opening , it brings awareness to doughnuts in general . " <p> The 3,600 Dunkin ' Donuts stores have a whopping 77 percent  --  and growing  --  market share in the United States , according to Technomic . <p> " I have n't heard of one instance where somebody 's closed " because of a Krispy Kreme moving in , said Brad Bruckman , Krispy Kreme 's Northern California franchisee . " We 'd rather increase the segment and get people eating more doughnuts . " <p> Sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annually , according to market researcher NPD Group . That should leave plenty of room for new stores . Krispy Kreme , which operates in 27 states , accounted for a tiny 3.7 percent of doughnut shop sales in 1998 , according to Technomic . <p> While Krispy Kreme expands , its growth plans are relatively modest . The company plans 22 new stores nationwide this year , and another 100 or so over the next three years , according to the SEC filing . <p> That would bring Krispy Kreme 's total to 260 , the approximate current size of Orange County 's Winchell 's Donut Houses . <p> Despite its long heritage , Krispy Kreme is a company in transition , and it has suffered from recent missteps . <p> The doughnut-maker posted a net loss of $3 million in 1998 due to restructuring costs and the closure of several experimental " double drive-through " locations . It has earmarked $30 million from its IPO to pay off debt . <p> While Krispy Kreme 's sales are growing fast  --  revenues rose 22 percent in 1999  --  its margins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yielded a shallow net margin of just 2.7 percent of revenues . <p> Until the mid-1990s , Krispy Kreme stores were more like wholesale bakeries than sit-down restaurants . In fact , most Krispy Kreme stores sell doughnuts to grocery stores and other retailers , something the Northern California stores plan to do eventually . <p> New stores are designed as " doughnut theaters " where customers can watch their crullers being made . <p> That means stores like the one in Union City remain unproven , noted Neil Stern , a restaurant consultant with McMillan/Doolittle . <p> " There is certainly some uncertainty " about the company 's future , Stern said . <p> A Krispy Kreme spokeswoman declined comment , citing legal restrictions related to the impending IPO . <p> Still , Stern says Krispy Kreme 's prospects look good . Its daily sales per store are about $54,000 , which is about 50 percent more than a McDonald 's and many multiples higher than the average doughnut shop , said Stern . " That 's huge , that 's unbelievable , that 's an amazing amount of doughnuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain similar volumes as it expands , " they should see net margins of 6 to 8 percent , which would make them the best in the fast-food industry , " Stern said . <p> The Union City store will be open 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and will pump out an extraordinary 650,000 doughnuts daily , said Bruckman . About 60 percent will be glazed rings while the remainder will be divided among 14 other varieties . <p> A Mountain View store is slated to open in July and a Sacramento location in August . <p> Bruckman , who is a minority investor in the local franchise while Krispy Kreme is the majority partner , has been scouting for sites in San Francisco . But restrictions on drive-through windows have made it difficult , he said . <p> The only likely area is in the southern part of the city where Route 101 connects with Interstate 280 and Bayshore Boulevard , he said . <p> Of course , not everyone is excited about Krispy Kreme 's Bay Area debut . <p> Yountville resident Dan Goldberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food newsletter , described Hot Original Glazed rings as " a lot of grease with very little substance . It 's not a serious doughnut experience . " <p> The current issue of Gourmet magazine is no more generous , referring to " incomprehensibly overpraised " Krispy Kreme doughnuts as " greasy sinkers. . . . cloying and dwarfish , leaden not long after being cooked , and about as interesting as a brick of sucrose . " <p> Even some Krispy Kreme fans see a downside . " I recently lost over 100 pounds , so maybe I can only eat two at a time , " said Washington . She used to eat six per trip .
