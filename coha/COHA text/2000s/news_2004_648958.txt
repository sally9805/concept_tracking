<p> As she prepared to swing the wire and ball of the hammer throw , Yelena Konevstova gestured to the tattered backstop where she stood and warned : " You better not stand here . There are holes in the net . " <p> She swung the hammer around her head before whirling and hurling it toward her trainer on the far side of a weedy lot , where broken sticks marked her previous efforts . This field , like most of the buildings here at the Podolsk Sportbaza , one of Russia 's principal Olympic training centers , just south of Moscow , shows the disrepair typical of post-Soviet Russia and its once-vaunted state sports machine . <p> Yet when the 2004 Games begin in Athens and the medals are counted , Russia is almost certain to be one of the top teams in the standing . It has remained there despite the dissolution of the Soviet Union and more than a decade of economic and social upheaval . <p> Senior officials  --  not only in the sports world but also in the government  --  confidently predict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over all that its athletes won in the 2000 Sydney Olympics , second to only the United States ' 40 gold and 97 over all . There are even brash predictions that Russia will surpass the United States , and every other team . <p> " We are very ambitious , like the Americans , the Chinese , the Germans , " said Vyacheslav Fetisov , who took over the state sports committee , now known as the Agency for Physical Culture , Sport and Tourism , in 2002 . Before that , he spent 14 seasons as a player and coach in the National Hockey League , mostly with the Devils . <p> It may be too soon to declare the return of a Soviet-like machine , which was created and lavishly supported during the cold war to demonstrate the supremacy of the Soviet system . But renewed attention and money from the country 's most prominent sports patron , President Vladimir V. Putin , has rekindled Russia 's Olympic aspirations . Federal and city officials are even expressing hope that a strong performance will bolster Moscow 's campaign to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Olympic team has once again become a vehicle for the country 's national pride , still deeply conflicted after nearly 13 years of post-Soviet transition . <p> The government sent off the team with official farewell ceremonies last week in Red Square and in Victory Park in Moscow , with the Russian Orthodox Church even dispatching an icon of St. George with them to Athens . <p> To sweeten the incentive , the government has also promised tax-free bonuses , of $50,000 for gold medalists , $20,000 for silver and $10,000 for bronze . They are not as lucrative as the array of benefits lavished on Soviet champions , but they are staggering sums in a country where the average annual income remains less than $3,000 . <p> The 467 Russian athletes headed to Athens are widely considered the strongest national team since 1992 , when Russia participated in Barcelona , Spain , as part of a unified team of former Soviet republics . That team that topped the medal standing with 45 gold and 111 medals over all . <p> With athletes from Ukraine , Belarus and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with still more departing for the United States and Europe , Russia dropped to third over all in Atlanta in 1996 before bouncing back in Sydney , Australia . In Athens , the Russians are expected to contend not only in the country 's traditional strengths , like gymnastics , but also in sports in which they have recently fared poorly , like track and field and swimming . <p> " We are going to tear them apart , " Svetlana Krivelyova , the gold medalist in women 's shot-put in Barcelona , said after finishing a late-afternoon workout here . <p> Krivelyova , who finished 10th in Atlanta and 4th in Sydney , has been in competition long enough to have benefited from the Soviet Union 's elaborate state network of sports schools and training centers , which she credits for her longevity in the sport . <p> She also experienced the system 's decay in the 1990 's , when the state money evaporated . For an athlete , especially an Olympian , she said , things are worse today than before , but some of the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the American camps , our facilities are worse , " she said . " But there is a slogan in Russian , ' The worse , the better . " ' <p> The new attention on Olympic sports in Russia reflects the country 's comparative stability and wealth after the chaos of the 1990 's . Russia endured a financial crisis in 1998 that left the government struggling to pay for wages and pensions , let alone sports programs . It also reflects the personality of Putin , who carefully cultivates his public image as a sportsman ( judo and skiing ) and has often urged Russians to become healthier and more fit . <p> Since Fetisov took over the sports agency , Putin 's government has tripled spending on sports , to roughly $200 million . The money , Fetisov said , has gone to new facilities , sports clubs and training programs across Russia , and in many places it was their first infusion of cash since Soviet times . <p> The national Olympic committee and the federations representing each sport have also turned to Russia 's new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States . Sponsors include the country 's biggest companies , like Aeroflot , Lukoil , Sberbank and Gazprom . In the last two years , Putin has also paid 3,000 Olympic athletes a monthly stipend of $500 ; those interviewed here called it little more than subsistence , but welcome nonetheless . <p> Fetisov , in an interview in his office inside a partly crumbling and partly restored 18th-century mansion in Moscow , said Russia still had a long way to go . " We do n't have enough swimming pools , " he said , adding that the country 's pool of talent has never really dried up . " We 're still producing young , talented athletes . " <p> The distance the Soviet machine has fallen , and the distance the new Russian machine has to go , is evident at Podolsk Sportbaza , or Podolsk Sports Base . A former country estate , the base was a hospital during World War II before the Soviet Union turned it into one of its Olympic training camps in 1952 . <p> Athletes and coaches praised its location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow 's outer ring , for its tranquility and fresh air , but some high schools in the United States have better facilities . <p> The running track has a new surface , but it is surrounded by rusted bleachers and twisted fences . The stucco of every building is crumbling . Much of the grounds is overgrown with grass and weeds . <p> Still , with the opening ceremony only days away , 280 athletes and coaches from track and field , weight lifting , wrestling , and men 's and women 's judo have filled it for a last round of training . The government is paying the tab of $30 a day per person for room and board . <p> " We do not need much , " said Gogi Koguashvili , a native Georgian and naturalized Russian who won a bronze medal in Greco-Roman wrestling in 1992 . " We need a room , something to eat and a place to wrestle . " <p> When state support of sports withered in the 1990 's , he said , the result was felt in many ways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve as sparring partners . <p> " Nobody wanted to take care of sports then , " he said . " It was a very difficult time . " <p> The state , though , gave him an apartment in Moscow , among the few benefits the new Russia could offer its citizens . And like many athletes at the time , he made enough of a living to allow him to devote his time to training . He won five world championships in the light-heavyweight division from 1993 to 1999 . <p> In his case , money came from unofficial sponsors , which he declined to identify , except to say that they were friends and other fans of the sport . That is now supplemented by Putin 's grant of $500 . <p> " At this moment , I work only at sport , " he said . " I do not have to worry about money .

He cited the training methods , the coaches and ultimately the desire to perform on behalf of the country . <p> Karelin , revered in Soviet and now Russian sports history , was elected to the country 's lower house of parliament last year as a member of United Russia , the pro-Putin political party that has sought to revive aspects of the country 's Soviet past . <p> " A lot has changed , " Karelin said outside the wrestling team 's evening training session on Monday , " but not the spirit of the team . We all represent Russians ' hopes . Every time , we have to give them reason to be proud .
