Jackson , Tennessee , was a town laid out with big things in mind . The first streets were ninety feet wide . The first courthouse was built of logs , back at the start of the 1820s . Now , more than forty years later , buildings of red and gray brick prevailed . Oaks and elms helped shade those broad streets . The Madison County seat had not flourished quite so much as its founders hoped . Still , with the Forked Deer River running through the town and two railroads meeting there , Jackson was modestly prosperous , or a bit more than modestly . It was a considerable market for lumber and furs and produce from the farms in the Forked Deer valley . When civil war tore the United States in two , Jackson went back and forth between Union and Confederacy several times . Confederate General Beauregard made his headquarters there in early 1862 . From that summer to the following spring , Jackson lived under the Stars and Stripes as one of U. S. Grant 's supply depots . Then Nathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In June 1863 , U.S. General Hatch defeated the Confederate garrison and reoccupied the town . Now , in April 1864 , Forrest was back , and the Stainless Banner replaced the U.S. flag . Forrest had his headquarters in the Duke home on MainStreet . Two years earlier , Grant had stayed in the same two-story Georgian Colonial house . The Dukes were happier to accommodate the Confederate cavalry commander than they had been to host his opponent in blue . Although Forrest went to church on Sunday morning , he did not treat the Sabbath as a day of rest . For one thing , he could n't afford to . For another , his driving energy made him hate idleness at any time . He paced back and forth across the Dukes ' parlor like a caged catamount , boots clumping on the rugs and thumping on the oak planks of the floor . He was a big man , two inches above six feet , towering over the other Confederate officers in the room . He could have beaten any of them in a fight , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it ; it gave him part of his power over them . Though his chin beard was graying , his wavy hair had stayed dark . His blue eyes could go from blizzard cold to incandescent in less than a heartbeat . " I wrote to Bishop Polk last week that I was going to take Fort Pillow , " he said . He had a back-country accent , but a voice that could expand at need to fill any room or any battlefield . " I reckon we can go about doing it now . All the pieces are in place . " His aide-de-camp , Captain Charles Anderson , nodded . " Yes , sir , " he said . " General Buford 's raising Cain up in Kentucky , and we 've got enough men looking busy down by Memphis to keep the damnyankees there from moving north along the Mississippi . " " About time we gave that garrison what it deserves , " Forrest said . " Past time , by God . Niggers and homemade Yankees . . . " He scowled at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Beats me . " Nathan Bedford Forrest 's scowl deepened . That black men should take up arms against whites turned every assumption on which the Confederate States of America were founded upside down and inside out . " You sooner get bit by a cottonmouth or a rattlesnake ? " Dr. J. B. Cowan , the chief surgeon on Forrest 's staff , looked up from his cup of sassafras tea . " No , " he said . " I 'd sooner not . " The concise medical opinion made Forrest and the rest of his staff officers laugh . But mirth did not stay on the commanding general 's face for long . Most of the white Union troops in Fort Pillow were Tennesseans themselves , enemy soldiers from a state that belonged in the Confederacy . When they came out of their works , they plundered the people who should have been their countrymen . If half of what Forrest heard was true , they did worse than that to the womenfolk . And so . . . " We 'll move then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir ? " " Colonel McCulloch 's brigade is at Sharon 's Ferry along the Forked Deer , right ? " Forrest said . Anderson nodded . Forrest went on , " And General Bell 's got his brigade up at Eaton , in Gibson County ? " He waited . Charles Anderson nodded again . " Yes , sir , that 's where he was last we heard from him . " Forrest waved dismissively . " Yankees have n't got enough men up there to shift him , so that 's where he 's at , all right . How many soldiers you reckon McCulloch and Bell put together have ? " Anderson 's eyes took on a faraway look . Under his mustache , his lips moved silently . He wore a neat beard much like Bedford Forrest 's . " I 'd say about fifteen hundred , sir . " " ' Bout what I ciphered out for myself . Wanted to make sure you were with me . " Forrest 's gaze sharpened . " Now , Captain , how many Yankees d' you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have half that many . " This time , Anderson did n't hesitate , though he did add , " They 've got a gunboat out in the river to support the place . " " That 's bluff country , " Forrest said . " Gunboat wo n't be able to see up high enough to do ' em much good . Send orders to McCulloch and Bell , Captain . Get ' em moving tomorrow . I want them to hit Fort Pillow first thing Tuesday morning . We will take it away from the United States , and we will free this part of Tennessee from Yankee oppression . " " Yes , sir , " Anderson said once more . " General Bell in overall command ? " " No , General Chalmers . " Forrest made a sour face . He 'd tried to have James Chalmers posted somewhere other than under his command , but he 'd been overruled both here in the West and by the War Department in Richmond . Chalmers was a good -- better than a good -- cavalry officer , but not respectful enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in some others , he was more than a little like Forrest himself , though he had the education his superior lacked . " I 'll draft the orders , sir , and I 'll send them out as soon as you approve them , " Captain Anderson said . " Good . That 's good . Tell General Bell especially not to sit around there lollygagging . He 's got a long way to travel if he 's going to get there by morning after next . He 'd better set out just as fast as he can . " Anderson 's pen scratched across a sheet of paper . " I 'll make it very plain , " Forrest 's aide-de-camp promised . Forrest nodded . Anderson was a good writer , a confident writer . He made things sound the way they were supposed to . As for Forrest himself , he would sooner pick up a snake than a pen . Fort Pillow was not a prime post . When it rained , as it was raining this Monday morning , Lieutenant Mack Leaming 's barracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drips . The plink and splat of water falling into them was often better at getting men of the Thirteenth Tennessee Cavalry ( U.S. ) out of bed than reveille would have been . One of the troopers in the regiment swore as he sat up . " Listen to that for a while and you reckon you 've got to piss , even if you just went and did , " he grumbled . " Piss on the Rebs , " said the fellow in the next cot . " Pipe down , both of you , " Leaming hissed . He was about twenty-five , with a round face , surprisingly innocent blue eyes , and a scraggly , corn-yellow mustache that curled down around the corners of his mouth . " Some of the boys are still sleeping . " Snores proved him right . Quite a few of the " boys " were older than he was . The bugler 's horn sounded a few minutes later . Some of the men slept in their uniforms . The ones who 'd stripped to their long johns climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn gray earlier in the war . Most of those troopers were all the more eager to punish backers of the Confederacy . A few , perhaps , might put on gray again if they saw the chance . Leaming chuckled softly as he pulled on his trousers . That would n't be so easy . The United States wanted men who 'd fought for the other side to return to the fold . The Confederates were less forgiving . In places like western Tennessee , the war was n't country against country . It was neighbor against neighbor , friend against former friend . Some of the troopers wore government-issue kepis . More used broad-brimmed slouch hats that did a better job of keeping the rain out of their faces . " Come on , boys , " Leaming said . " Let 's get out there for roll call . Do n't want to keep Major Bradford waiting . " Bill Bradford was a man with pull . The Thirteenth Tennessee Cavalry was his creation . Recruitment and promotion were informal in these parts . Since Bradford came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that won him the gold oak leaves on his shoulder straps . And he 'd made an able enough commander so far . Pulling his own slouch hat down low over his eyes , Mack Leaming went outside . Along with the Thirteenth Tennessee Cavalry , four companies of heavy artillery and a section of light artillery were lining up for roll call and inspection . Leaming lips skinned back from his teeth in a mirthless grin . The artillerymen came from colored outfits . The officers and senior sergeants were white men , but the men they led had been slaves till they decided to take up arms against the whites who 'd held them in bondage -- and who wanted to keep on doing it . Nigger soldiers , Leaming thought . He did n't like fighting on the same side as black men in arms -- he was no nigger lover , even if he fought for the U.S.A. A Negro with a Springfield in his hands went dead against everything the South stood for . Leaming also wondered if the blacks would fight , if they could fight . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both older and taller than the men in his own regiment . They drilled smartly , going through their evolutions with smooth precision . But could they fight ? He 'd believe it when he saw it . Major Booth , who commanded them , seemed to have no doubts . Leaming might have trouble taking colored troops seriously . Nobody in his right mind , though , could lightly dismiss Lionel Booth . He was a veteran of the Regular Army , his face weathered though he was only in his mid-twenties , one cheek scarred by a bullet crease . Though he and his men came up from Memphis only a couple of weeks before , he was senior in grade to Major Bradford and in overall command at Fort Pillow . Back when the war was new , Confederate General Gideon Pillow ordered the First Chickasaw Bluff of the Mississippi fortified . With customary modesty , he named the position after himself . As the crow flew , Fort Pillow lay not quite forty miles north of Memphis . Following the river 's twists and turns , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . General Pillow did n't think small when he built his works . His line ran for a couple of miles from Coal Creek on the north to the Mississippi on the west . The next Confederate officer who had to try to hold the place built a shorter line inside the one Pillow laid out . That did n't do any good , either . When the Confederates in the West fell back in 1862 , Federal troops occupied Fort Pillow . The U.S. Army kept nothing but the tip of the triangle between the Mississippi and Coal Creek . The present earthworks protected only the bluffs at the apex of the triangle and ran for perhaps four hundred feet . The Federals did keep pickets in rifle pits dug along the second , shorter , Confederate line . These days , six pieces of field artillery aided the defenders : two six-pounders , two twelve-pounders , and two ten-pounder Parrott long guns . They were newly arrived with the colored troops from the Sixth U.S. Heavy Artillery and Second U.S. Light Artillery . Having come under artillery fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right mind . He assumed the Confederates felt the same way . Major Bradford strode up in front of the drawn-up ranks of cavalrymen . Leaming saluted him . " All men present and accounted for , sir , " he said . Military formality sounded good . Outside the perimeter defined by the soldiers in the rifle pits , where would the troopers of the Thirteenth Tennessee Cavalry go ? If they did n't ride out in force , they were asking to get bushwhacked , to get knocked over the head and tipped into the Mississippi or buried in shallow graves with their throats cut . " Thank you , Lieutenant . " Bradford returned Leaming 's salute with a grand flourish . He enjoyed being a major . He did n't much enjoy losing command of the fort to Major Booth . He could n't do anything about it , though , not unless he wanted to arrange an accident for the younger man . Nodding to Leaming , he said , " Have the men fall out for sick call . " " Fall out for sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . One of them shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot . " Sir , permission to visit the latrines ? " he said . When Leaming nodded , he scurried away . Most of the sick men probably had some kind of flux of the bowels . Camp in one place for a while and that would happen , no matter how careful you were . Bad air or something , Leaming thought . Doctors could n't do much about it . An opium plug might slow down the shits for a while . If you were already plugged up , the surgeon would give you a blue-mass suppository instead . Leaming did n't know what the hell blue mass was . By the way it shifted whatever you had inside you , he suspected it was related to gunpowder . After roll call , he went up to Bradford and asked , " Any word of trouble from the Rebs ? " " Not here . " The other officer shook his head . " I reckon General Hurlbut started seeing shadows under his bed , that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niggers ? " He had even less use for them than Leaming did . " Worried about Forrest , I expect , " Leaming said . " Way he chased Fielding Hurst into Memphis . . . " Colonel Hurst 's Sixth Tennessee Cavalry ( U.S. ) had had the misfortune of running into a detachment from Forrest 's force not long before . Hurst 's men were rough and tough and nasty . They needed to be . Like the Thirteenth , they were homemade Yankees , and the hand of every Secesh man in the state was raised against them . However rough , tough , and nasty they were , they could n't stand up to Forrest 's troopers . Major Bradford chuckled unkindly . " I hear tell Hurst ran away so hard , he galloped right out from under his hat . " What could be more fun than hashing over another outfit 's shortcomings ? " I hear tell he left his white mistress behind , " Leaming said , " and his colored one , too . " Now Bradford laughed a dirty laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em both in the same bed at the same time . " With a sigh , he pulled his mind back to matters military . " But anyway , Forrest is n't anywhere near here . He 's off at Jackson , and that 's got to be seventy miles away . " " I was talking with one of the officers who came up with the coons , " Leaming said . " You know what Forrest had the nerve to do ? " " Son of a bitch has the nerve to do damn near anything . That 's what makes him such a nuisance , " Major Bradford said . " What is it this time ? " " He sent Memphis a bill for the five thousand and however many dollars Colonel Hurst squeezed out of Jackson while he held it , " Leaming said . Bradford laughed again , this time on a different note . " He better not hold his breath till he gets it , that 's all I 've got to say . He 'll be a mighty blue man in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all Hurst has squeezed out of the Rebs -- not even close . " " Do n't I know it ! " Mack Leaming spoke more in admiration than anything else . Colonel Fielding Hurst had turned the war into a profitable business for himself . People said he 'd taken more than $100,000 from Confederate sympathizers in western Tennessee . Leaming could n't have said if that was true , but he would n't have been surprised . The Thirteenth Tennessee Cavalry had done its share of squeezing , too , but the Sixth was way ahead of it . " So anyhow , " Major Bradford went on , " I do n't reckon we 've got to do a whole lot of worrying about Bedford Forrest right this minute . " " Sounds good to me , sir , " Leaming said . ...
