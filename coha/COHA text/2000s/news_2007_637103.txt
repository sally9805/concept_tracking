<p> Georgia Brock lives in a second-floor apartment at Jerusalem House , a peaceful dwelling for HIV-positive single mothers and their children . <p> Her space has three bedrooms and a living room-kitchen combo . There 's a well-used sectional , a table with four chairs and a small entertainment center pushed against bare walls  --  reminders of all that she has lost and gained . <p> For sustenance , she spends her mornings with the Lord in prayer and thanksgiving . <p> This Mother 's Day will be no different . <p> She wo n't expect much in the way of gifts . Maybe handprints in plaster of Paris , maybe sentiments crafted on construction paper or the spray-painted macaroni mothers have come to expect this Sunday in May . <p> She will accept each prize with a great big smile and an ache , because if there is one thing that weighs heavily on Brock , it is the prospect of dying before the four grandchildren she 's raising are old enough to fend for themselves . <p> And so spending time with them and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I do n't have any special plans , " she said .

Brock is the only grandmother , her grandson the only child who is HIV-positive , but the seventh since the program opened in 1997 . <p> She has become a stabilizing presence at Jerusalem House , which sits atop a hill just off North Decatur Road . She is a religious woman who tries to live her life accordingly . She is calm and committed to providing a stable home for her four grandchildren . <p> " She 's got a lot on her but has a great attitude , " said Janice Harris-Corry , director of housing at Jerusalem House . " She 's brought a lot of harmony here . " <p> When verbally attacked , she walks away in favor of peacekeeping . When the place needs sprucing up , Brock usually leads the effort . And when younger residents seek advice or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Born to a mechanic , Brock was one of 10 siblings . She dropped out of high school in the ninth grade after becoming pregnant with her daughter , Sebrina . To support herself and her new baby , she became a nanny and then a scanner at Choice Atlanta , a food sorting business . <p> " My life has always been hard , " she said . <p> No mother plans a path like this  --  nursing an incurable disease , raising kids , keeping doctor 's appointments , making PTA meetings , managing a daily regimen of pills , and wondering where her grown daughter might be . <p> But it happens  --  to the crack addict on Moreland Avenue , to the Dunwoody housewife , to grandmothers like Georgia Brock . <p> " It can happen to all of us , " Harris-Corry said . <p> Active in church <p> After raising a daughter and a son , Brock , who never married , was on her own . <p> Sebrina left home when she was 14 to live with Brock 's oldest sister . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her son , Eric , left , too . <p> Brock did n't see either of them much after that . And when she heard anything at all , it was almost always bad news . Sebrina was on the street , addicted to crack . When she did come around , she was usually pregnant or about to give birth . <p> Brock had looked forward to lazy days fishing and traveling with her church . It was the only way she could afford to see the world on a nanny 's salary . <p> For 15 years , the Fountain of Praise , a Holiness church on Atlanta 's Southside , was her life . <p> She was an usher , a member of the outreach ministry and the women 's conference . She sang alto and tenor in the senior choir and headed the pastor 's aid committee . <p> When she was n't at church or working , she played spades or assembled jigsaw puzzles  --  sweet diversions from her worries . <p> " That was my life , " she said . <p> Romantic interlude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . But on Valentine 's Day 1996 , a man in her neighborhood Publix caught her eye . The thought of male companionship , someone to share dinner and a movie , excited her . Within months of their first meeting , she was smitten . <p> " He was very attentive , " Brock recalled . " He started to go to church with me . " <p> But by the end of the summer that year , the romance was over . They went their separate ways . <p> Soon Brock began to get sick , mostly recurring colds that lingered for weeks . Sometimes she 'd go to the emergency room with a high fever . <p> Doctors checked her for high blood pressure . They screened for cancer and ran tests on her kidneys but found nothing . Finally , they asked her consent to check for HIV . <p> Later , doctors gave her the news . She had AIDS . <p> " My whole life was shattered , " she said . " I was in a fearful state . I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left Grady Memorial Hospital and aimlessly boarded a train at the Georgia State station . It was early morning . Her relationship with her friend played in her mind . In the beginning , they practiced safe sex , but once in the heat of the moment , she let her guard down . That 's how it happened , she figured . When she got off the train , it was 7 p.m . <p> " I just rode back and forth , back and forth , " she said . " I was frightened out of my mind . " <p> She wondered : What am I going to do ? <p> New worries <p> At first she went into denial , believing doctors had made a mistake . <p> For the next weeks and months , she went to work , came home , watched television and went to bed . She never returned to the doctor . <p> The diagnosis briefly drifted away in 1998 , when Brock became the legal guardian for Sebrina 's three children : Jonathan , Cammeron and Laprecious . <p> But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of shingles forced Brock to see just how formidable a foe the disease was . <p> " I was so sick , I could n't walk , " she said . <p> Doctors took care of the shingles and started her on an AIDS drug cocktail . <p> Around the same time , Sebrina reappeared . Brock 's life was about to take another bad turn . <p> Sebrina was HIV-positive , too , and had given birth to her fourth child , a son with traces of crack in his blood . A caseworker from the Department of Family and Children Services called Brock and told her that unless she took custody , the baby would be placed in foster care . <p> Next to getting her own diagnosis , this was the worst moment in Brock 's life . <p> " It was like someone had snatched the life out of me , " she said . " I 'd had my chance to live , but he was just a baby . " <p> The day before Halloween in 1999 , Brock brought baby Derrick home from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brock wanted to scream too . She could barely care for Laprecious , Cammeron and Jonathan , who has spina bifida . How could she care for one more ? <p> " Me and Jesus , " she told herself . <p> ' A good place to be ' <p> Life began to settle down . <p> The disability payments Brock received for herself and Jonathan provided food , shelter , utilities as well as the occasional pair of shoes or dress or shirt the children needed . <p> She was proud of her grandkids . They were doing well in school . She rewarded them with a bus trip to Lenox Square and Phipps Plaza every Saturday , sometimes to shop , sometimes to just get out and look around . They always had dinner and took in a movie . <p> But just weeks before Christmas 2004 , fire destroyed the family 's home . Brock and all four grandchildren escaped . But she lost everything . <p> With no home and no hope , she found Jerusalem House , and early in 2005 , Brock moved in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to a playground on the property , a recreation center and a learning circle to help with schoolwork . <p> For holidays , Brock could always count on donations of gifts from the family program . For special occasions , they enjoy popcorn . When she wants to splurge , they eat hot wings . <p> She pays $515 in rent and can rest easy ; the utilities are included . <p> It has been a long journey . Brock still gets sick occasionally . Derrick , thankfully , is doing fine . Cammeron is a Boy Scout . Jonathan is an award-winning Special Olympian . And Laprecious is a straight-A student at Shamrock Middle School . <p> " It 's a good place to be , " Brock said of the family 's current state . " I do n't know what I 'd do without Jerusalem House . " <p> Although her battle with AIDS continues , Georgia Brock has arrived at a period of grace . She does n't plan or analyze her life . She 's just a grandmother hoping to live long enough to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . <p> She cries when she considers it all . <p> " This is really the first time I 've talked about everything that happened , " she said .
