The morning air still smelled of smoke . Wood ash mainly but there was also the acrid stench of burnt plastic and paint . And even though I knew it could n't be true , I thought I caught a whiff of putrid flesh from under the rubble across the street . The hardware store and Bernard 's Stationery Store were both completely gutted . The Gonzalez Market had been looted but only a part of its roof had been scorched . The corner building , however , Lucky Dime Liquors , had been burned to the ground . Manny Massman was down in the rubble with his two sons , kicking the metal fixtures . At one point the middle-aged store owner lowered his head and cried . His sons put their hands on his shoulders . I understood how he felt . He had everything in that liquor store . His whole life . And now , after a five-day eruption of rage that had been simmering for centuries , he was penniless and destitute . In his mind he had n't done a thing wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about calling someone a nigger or boy . But the men and women down around Central and Eighty-sixth Place took everything of Manny 's that they could carry , then smashed and burned the rest . Four young black men passed in front of the liquor lot . One of them shouted something at the white men . Manny barked back . The youths stopped . The Massman sons stepped forward with their chests out and their mouths full of angry sounds . It 's starting all over again , I thought . Maybe we 'll be rioting a whole year . Maybe it wo n't ever end . The black men crossed the threshold of the Lucky Dime 's property line . Stephen Massman bent down to pick up a piece of metal that had once been attached to their counter . One of the angry youths shoved Martin . I held my breath . " Halt ! " a man shouted through a megaphone . A dozen or more soldiers appeared out of nowhere . A black soldier wearing a helmet and camouflage khakis talked to the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the store owners . The rest of the troop stood across the property line cutting off the ravaged lot from the street . Most of the National Guardsmen brandished rifles . A crowd was gathering . My hands clenched into fists so tight that my right forearm went into a spasm . While I massaged out the knot of pain , the black soldier , a sergeant , calmed the four youths . I could hear his voice but my fourth-story window was too far away for me to make out the words . I turned away from the scene and fell into the plush blue chair that sat at my desk . For the next hour I just sat there , hearing the sounds of people in the street but not daring to look down . It had been like that for the past five days : me holding myself in check while South Los Angeles went up in the flames of a race riot ; while stores were looted and snipers fired and while men , women , and children cried " Burn , baby , burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner familiar to me . I stayed shut up in my home , in peaceful West L.A. , not drinking and not going out with a trunk full of Molotov cocktails . WHEN I FINALLY roused myself the street down below was full of black people , some venturing out of their homes for the first time since the first night of rioting . Most of them looked stunned . I went to my office door and out into the hall . There was the smell of smoke in the building too , but not much . Steinman 's Shoe Repair was the only store that had been torched . That was on the first night , when the fire trucks still braved the hails of sniper bullets . The flames were put out before they could spread . I went to the far stairwell from my office and down the three flights to Steinman 's side entrance . There was a burnt timber blocking the way . I would have turned around if it were n't for the voices . " What the hell you mean you do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned up , " a frail voice replied in a mild German accent . " That 's not my fault , man , " the angry voice said . " I give you my shoes , I expect to get them back . " " They are all burned . " " And do you think if this was my store that I could tell you I did n't have nuthin ' for ya ? " the customer said . " Do you think a black man could just say his store done burned down so he do n't have to make good on his responsibilities ? " " I do n't have your shoes . " I shoved the timber out of the way , smudging the palms of my hands with sooty charcoal . When I came into the burned-out room , both occupants turned to look at me . Theodore was a short , powerfully built white man with little hair and big hands . The irate customer was much larger , with a wide chest and a big face that would have been beautiful on a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wait your turn , man , " the Negro customer warned . " I got business to take care of first . " He swiveled his head back to the cobbler and said , " Those shoes costed me thirty-six dollars and if you ca n't give ' em up right now I want to see some money across this here hand . " I took a quick breath and then another . There was an electric tingle over my right cheekbone and for a moment the room was tinged in red . " Brother , " I said . " You got to go . " " Are you talkin ' to me , niggah ? " " You heard me , " I said in a tone that you ca n't make up . " I been in the house for some time now , trying not to break out and start doin ' wrong . I 've been patient and treadin ' softly . But if you say one more word to my friend here I will break you like a matchstick and throw you out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the big beautiful man said with tears in his voice . " He owe it to me . It do n't matter what they did . " I heard his cracked tone . I knew that he was just as crazy as I was at that moment . We were both black men filled with a passionate rage that was too big to be held in . I did n't want to fight but I knew that once I started , the only thing that would stop me would be his lifeless throat crushed by my hand . " Here you are , sir , " Theodore said . He was handing over a ten-dollar bill . " Your shoes were old , you know , " the shoemaker said . " And they both needed soles . It was a good make and I would have bought them for seven dollars . So here 's ten . " The burly man stared at the note a moment . Then he looked up at me . " Forget it , " he said . He turned around so quickly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach out for a broken , charred timber for support . " Ow ! " he shouted , probably because of a splinter , but I ca n't say for sure because he blundered out , tearing the front door off of its last hinge as he went . There was a sleek antique riding saddle on the floor , under a shattered wooden chair . I moved away the kindling and picked up the saddle . Theodore had received it from his uncle who was a riding master in Munich before World War I. I 'd always admired the leatherwork . Setting the riding gear on a fairly stable part of his ruined worktable , I said , " You did n't have to pay him , Mr. Steinman . " " He was hurting , " the small man replied . " He wanted justice . " " That 's not your job . " " It is all of our job , " he said , staring at me with blue eyes . " You can not forget that . " " Ezekiel Rawlins ? " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a white man 's voice . Putting those bits of information together , I knew that I was being addressed by the police .
