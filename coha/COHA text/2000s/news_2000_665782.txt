They were just inscrutable boxes of black-and-white text I had to flip past to get to a more interesting section of the newspaper . These days , I slow down when I see them , as I might walk past headstones in a graveyard . I see names and dates buried in the legalese : a street , an address . A home . Often the names are followed by the words " husband and wife . " <p> I wonder how they 're doing , if they 'll make it . <p> A year and a half ago , my husband and I were the ones facing foreclosure , hanging off a cliff by our well-gnawed fingernails . I know the exhaustion and terror of staring into that abyss . It 's hard on the soul , and it 's hell on a marriage . We came back from the brink , but we still find ourselves playing chicken with it from time to time , when a job is slow to pay or an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tempting to assume that people who fall on hard times have brought it upon themselves , through recklessness or greed . But every financial disaster is disastrous in its own way  --  easy enough to see where the downward spiral ends , harder to sort out where it began . <p> In 2004 , my husband , Patrick , left a 20-year career in corporate advertising to open his own design studio . Other people on the verge of such a leap might have gotten all their ducks in a row first : formulated a business plan , banked a year 's worth of living expenses . <p> We 've never been other people . There was no plan . Our ducks tend to be free-range . We 'd chased after them a few times  --  like running off to Mexico early in our courtship to live until our money ran out , then coming back to the States to start over with nothing but our clothes and an antique Mercury Comet , powder-blue and chrome . " Fortune favors the bold " was our motto . <p> When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But after our kids came , Patrick 's wistful notion of working for himself kept getting deferred . " When the children are all in school , " I 'd tell him . Or , " When we 've saved enough money . " And then , " When we 're out of debt . " When it feels safe to abandon a predictable paycheck , matching contributions to a 401(k) , group health insurance , and paid vacation , that 's when . <p> That day never came . Patrick kept the lid on his growing unhappiness until it began to leak out messily . <p> He and his job broke up . <p> At the time , my part-time income as an administrative assistant barely covered groceries . It was just something on the side , a foothold in the grown-up world . For now , I was content with the job that mattered most to me : being home with our three small children . I thought it was the thing that mattered most to Patrick also  --  a noble reason to put up with an unsatisfactory situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was angry , disappointed , and frightened when he came to the end of his rope . <p> But I could also see how deeply unhappy my husband had become , and how long he 'd been trying to hide it . His career as a hired hand in a small market was at a creative dead end . Freelancing from our home would give him the variety and autonomy he was longing for , and allow him to spend more time with our kids . We had a little bit of savings , and Patrick had 20 years ' worth of contacts in the business . I was willing to give it a chance . <p> As the saying goes , when the students are ready , the teacher will appear . Ours was a financial adviser named Linda Bessette . A friend recommended her , assuring us that even one session would be an hour and $75 well spent . Linda listened to our hopes and fears , reviewed our numbers , looked us straight in the eye , and told us in her no-bull New England accent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had talked over the years about striking out on his own , I had frankly underestimated the motivating power of independence . The husband I had feared was too laid-back to chase clients methodically and determinedly sought work , and work came . But his business tends to be one of feast or famine , subject to seasonal cycles , economic conditions , and chance . Months sometimes pass between checks ; sometimes , between jobs . " Why did n't we go to med school ? " I said to Patrick when my son asked why he could n't buy his lunch instead of packing it every day . " What were we thinking ? " <p> Linda gave us much-needed perspective for the long haul . " Look , " she 'd say , when our confidence wavered , " most start-ups do n't show any profit at all in the first few years . You guys are making your living from this right out of the gate . " <p> Well , barely . But it helped to hear it . Besides her sheer faith in our abilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribution during our start-up year was to remind us that we had choices . " You could rent out a room in your house , " she pointed out . " You could sell it . You can enroll the kids in public school instead of paying private tuition . " <p> She was right . We did have choices . But we were trying not to exercise the tough ones . I , especially , was still clinging to the infrastructure of salaried life . I never wanted to be the poster girl for frugal living . I enjoy material comforts as much as the next person . I 'd been looking at sharing a car and hand-me-downs as short-term pain for long-term gain . <p> It was n't terribly traumatic to pack lunches and clip coupons . But the idea of making drastic changes to our living space or the children 's education was . The school is special , we explained . Our home is sacred . <p> Still , Linda challenged us to rethink all our assumptions . " What are you waiting for ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vocational back burner . <p> I found I did n't have a good answer for that , since it was something I could do from home . I had the uncomfortable awareness that I had been using my kids as a shield between my dream and me . <p> I kept my paying job , but I also began writing again . My first fee  --  $100 for a guest commentary in a newspaper  --  felt like a cool million . <p> At the end of our first year in business , we got a pleasant surprise : We were n't too far behind our income from Patrick 's corporate job the year before . Cost-cutting measures filled in some of the gap . We closed the rest with savings withdrawals and credit cards . Meantime , Patrick and I were reveling in the novelty of being at home together every day . <p> The second year proved to be a different story . Nearly every month , there was a point at which we thought the last job had gone out the door . No one would ever give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deluged and working 72-hour stretches . Remind me how this is less stressful than agency work , I was tempted to ask at those times . Remind me about all the togetherness , I wanted to say , when he was working morning to night and I was feeling nostalgic for Monday to Friday , 8 to 5 . <p> We survived those months one last-minute reprieve after another . Disaster would loom , and a check would appear at the 59th minute of the 11th hour . I was frustrated , fatigued , and flat-out furious at the zero-sum-ness of it all . Always just enough . Always just in time . I was sick of just . We were living retroactively , unable to get enough traction to get caught up , much less ahead . <p> The question of affording school tuition for the next year became moot . I wrote the headmistress , informing her we 'd have to withdraw . She steered us to scholarship funds that would fully supplement the financial aid we already received . <p> On registration day , my third grader saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could sign up . " I do n't have money for that today , " I said , as matter-of-factly as I could muster . A smartly dressed mother at the sign-up table turned to look at me . <p> A moment later , another parent walked up beside me , the mother of the kid whose used social studies book I had bought for my son . In what would have been a comedy of errors if it had n't been so embarrassing , the check I had written for it had bounced , and then the check I had written to cover that had bounced . The book wound up costing me an arm and a leg after all the fees had been paid . It 's expensive to be poor . <p> Not one of these events in isolation would have fazed me . I 'm OK with telling my kids when we ca n't afford something . As my friend who works in a posh boutique assures me , even wealthy people bounce checks sometimes . But all together , it was just too much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the 10 years we 'd been married . I worried we were failing our kids . <p> We 'd been meeting with Linda less regularly , since we could no longer afford to pay cash , and I hated to take advantage of her willingness to run us a tab . When I put in an SOS call , she insisted we come in that day . <p> Ironically , in spite of our day-to-day crisis , the big picture was looking good . Patrick 's client base was growing ; my writing was getting picked up . To quit now would be to throw away all that promise . " Now is not the time to take your eyes off the ball , " Linda reminded us . " Let 's go over all of your choices . " <p> The " choices " now were declaring bankruptcy or selling the house . Linda matter-of-factly outlined the pros and cons of each . Everything was on the table now . My husband and I tiptoed around it gingerly , the way we walked around each other . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say aloud what he thought we should do . He had asked me to come out on this limb with him , and he knew there were days I was close to pushing him off , when I wished he would just grow up , get a real job . Rescue me . <p> " I think maybe the struggle to hang on to the house has become more difficult than it would be to let it go , " Patrick said quietly . <p> Easy for you to say , I felt like shouting . This was all your stupid idea anyway . But I knew Linda would never let me get away with it . Choices , she 'd say . Decisions . It was time for us to make one . <p> Patrick was open to either selling the house or rebooting our debt load by filing for bankruptcy . Whatever it would take to turn us around , forward facing . I wanted to explore refinancing our house first . Our credit was shot , but we had built quite a bit of equity . All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nice to think , before life really tests you , that you 'll be the couple who exemplify unity and grace under pressure . I would like to tell you we are that Couple . But the truth is , the navigation of life 's more harrowing storms has not always been accomplished using our indoor voices . <p> On a good day , I was proud of my husband for striking out on his own , and proud of myself for being able to take the leap of faith with him . <p> On a good day , one of us could always find a way to make the other smile . " Got to keep you in the lifestyle to which you 've lowered your expectations , " he 'd say with a wink and a grin , when I 'd chide him about working long hours . <p> On a good day , I knew that our marriage did not depend on the score on our credit report . <p> The Tuesday before Thanksgiving , 2007 , was not a good day . <p> The fall quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month of October . A client who owed him thousands of dollars was MIA . Our attempt to refinance our home had hit a brick wall . <p> We were spiraling down . The only avenue left was to try and sell quickly , ahead of foreclosure . In the meantime , there was the immediate future and the holiday season to get through . I knew we would have to swallow our pride and reach out . <p> That morning , I drove past a man on the freeway holding a cardboard sign . COULD USE A LITTLE HELP , it said . I had $10 in my purse , and I did n't know where the next $10 was coming from . I was on the opposite side of the road . It would make a good story to say I turned around and gave him half of what I had , but I did n't . I borrowed his sign and hung it on my heart instead . <p> I e-mailed my mom and a family friend through tears . We could use a little help . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we lose our home , " I told Patrick after sending the message , " I do n't know if I can forgive you . " <p> Patrick , already haunted by the thought of failing to provide for his family , bent his head and walked outside to sit on the porch and brood until our kids got home . <p> All night , my bitter words hung in the air . I thought it would make me feel better if I could point my finger at someone and say , " You did this , now you fix it . " It did n't . I had the sick feeling I had cashed in something precious for something very cheap . <p> The next day , the eve of Thanksgiving , I got up early and considered our blessings . We had family and friends who would not let us go homeless or hungry . We had three healthy and happy sons whom we hoped we were buffering from the worst of our anxiety . We 'd had promising signs that our respective careers would flourish if we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had created . <p> And we had each other . Once , that had been all I ever wanted . <p> " Meet me a little bit of the way , " Patrick said to me years ago , when he had already moved to Mexico . We 'd met on the Internet and had been carrying on an epic , coast-to-coast courtship . I stood frozen in fear and indecision at the other end of the phone line , the opposite corner of the continent . " Just a little bit , " he repeated . " I 'll come all the rest of the way to meet you . " <p> I packed a bag , got on a bus , and met him a few hundred miles from where I put down the phone . He came the other few thousand . <p> The best part of my life was everything that happened after . <p> Surely , after 10 years of marriage , I could find it in me to meet him more than just a little bit of the way . <p> In the morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on his face the day before . I took his hand in mine ; felt the innumerable , tiny scratches etched into his wedding band . If I counted them up , like the rings of a tree , would they tell the years ? " I 'm so sorry , " I said to him . " We can let go of this house . But not each other . " <p> Soon after the Christmas decorations came down , the FOR SALE sign went up . We were lucky . Not only did the house sell within days at the asking price , we fell in love with a smaller house in a wonderful , less expensive neighborhood . With a substantial down payment , we were able to secure a new mortgage . We set aside savings for the short and long term . Following Linda 's advice , we also set up a credit card repayment plan with a reputable debt management agency . <p> An agency counselor sat down with me to add up our debt . I cringed at the total , an amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . Most of it had been incurred at the grocery store and gas station  --  all those months when ends did n't quite meet . The agency renegotiated our interest rates and consolidated our monthly payments . <p> I swear , the minute we let go of everything we 'd been fighting so hard to keep , whatever had been stuck came unstuck , and opportunity came pouring in . Jobs that had been stalled for months resumed . Checks arrived for invoices that had been all but written off . You could almost hear the " pop . " <p> I ca n't tell anyone a thing about managing money . But I can tell you something about staying married when it feels like the ground beneath your feet is opening . We hoisted ourselves back up , but from time to time we get a mini refresher course . Here are some lessons we learned about recession-proofing a marriage . <p> L : Stay on the same team When my children split into opposing forces in imaginative play , I put everyone back on the same team , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisible enemy instead of one another , before someone gets walloped . Same for us . Expressing disagreement , distress , and anger is part of problem solving . But there 's healthy confrontation , and then there 's kicking someone when he or she is down . Use your fingers for grabbing hands and holding on , not pointing . You 're in this together . <p> L : Withdraw your identity from your bank account Deep in the trough , each of us secretly wished the other would grow up , get a real job . Then we could keep our house and fix it up , buy a second vehicle , go on vacations like our children 's classmates did . We measure a lot in this society by the wealth a person appears to have . When it feels like the rest of the world is looking down , be the one who keeps your mate 's chin up . Affirm other kinds of success : friendship , parenting , a talent . Everyone needs to hear the words , " I believe in you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> L : Maintain a one-man-down policy with each other Patrick and I share an unspoken understanding that only one of us can be " down " at any given time . If one is feeling depressed or anxious , the other has to stay up on his or her end of the seesaw . We have a script that goes something like this : <p> pre-formatted table It 's a good strategy for short-term dips , like a bad day , as long as there is equilibrium over time . The roles , after all , are interchangeable . <p> L : Reach out Letting friends and family in on what was going on with us was hard , but it opened the door to a flood of support , prayers , and , yes , some financial assistance . One friend scolded us for not telling her sooner what dire straits we were in . " Do n't be afraid to ask for help , Kyran , " she told me . " It 's part of life . " I was humbled to be on the receiving end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping to spare them the isolation of pride and perfectionism . Admitting we were vulnerable allowed others to let down their own facade of " fine , thank you . " People I 'd always thought of as " haves " confided " have-not " tales of debt , pink slips , bad investments . We realized we were hardly the first family to go through a rough patch . <p> L : Round up the sacred cows Where change is required , the options are often defined by what people wo n't give up . Bankruptcy was at odds with my definition of responsibility , and renting out a spare room to a boarder violated my husband 's sense of privacy . The space We allowed ourselves in which to imagine new solutions became a very small square bounded by all our lines drawn in the sand. - Eventually , we had to redraw the box . Each of us was being asked to place something we valued very highly in it , and we had to learn to give the other breathing room to reconsider it without feeling forced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and trust . We gained back much more than we gave up . <p> L : Take time out from worry As with our checking account , we were n't always able to put into our relationship what we needed to take out . It 's hard to afford romance and intimacy when you are consumed by worry . With three kids , long walks and leisurely conversations were rare luxuries . Dates might as well have been diamonds . Still , we tried . I declared brief holidays from worry , when we did our best to reconnect as a couple , watching a TV show together at the end of the day , or simply taking time out for a hug or shoulder rub . We found other ways to draw off worry : With a prayer or mantra , physical activity , or a household chore . When anything overwhelms us now , we ask , What is the next right thing ? Nine times out of 10 it 's something as simple as unloading the dishwasher or making some lunch . <p> L : Practice gratitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another variation on " That which does not kill us makes us stronger , " I was going to scream . Sometimes , that which does not kill us can beat us up and leave us in a ditch . So I hesitate on this last point because I know there is someone reading this who is in that ditch today , who 'd like to tell me what to do with my gratitude . <p> But there 's no way around it . There is nothing like fear for distorting perspective , and nothing like gratitude for restoring it . I 'm not talking about the false gratitude that denies that you or anyone else is suffering . Nor the shadowy kind that depends on the truism that somebody , somewhere , is always worse off than you , nor the timid thankfulness that does n't dare ask more from life than basic survival . I mean really appreciating what is in front of you right now , even if you do n't know if you can count on it tomorrow . <p> " I have everything I need today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard year . Even when we could n't quite believe it , it never failed to be true . <p> Gratitude still brings us through the rough spots " today . In the middle of some anxious weeks last month , I walked into my husband 's office and peered at him over his computer screen . " Hey , " I said . <p> His eyes looked tired . He 'd been working double-time to get us over the hump . I could see his shoulders hunched visibly higher than usual . But he smiled . <p> " Hey , " he said . " How are you doing ? " I knew he meant , How are we doing ? I had just come from the mailbox . Npthingyet . Our big monthly debt-reduction payment had just come out of our checking account . It was down to the three-figure mark , and our mortgage payment was coming due next week . <p> I reached over the screen and ran my finger along the worry line in my true love 's forehead , as if I could smooth it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over a decade ago when We traded all those blithe promises . I had no clue then how poor , how sick , how awful we could sometimes be . Nor any idea how rich , how strong , and how good . For that matter , I still did n't . <p> Life can get better , it can get worse . It will probably do both . " I have everything I need today , " I told him . <p> I could see in his sleepy eyes that we both did . And here , many days later , we still do . <p> There was a point at which we thought the last job had gone out the door . No one would give us another dime <p> By Kyran Pittman <p> Kyran Pittman lives in Little Rock , AR . She blogs at Notes to Self . <p>
