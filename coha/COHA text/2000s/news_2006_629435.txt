<p> NEW YORK - Sometimes he forgets his lines . <p> It does n't happen often , but now and again George Lee Andrews will be singing or gamboling onstage at the Majestic Theatre , in front of a crowd of 1,600 , and he will simply go blank . He 'll hunt , but it 's like the words are dressed incamouflage and hiding in the jungle . <p> " Oh , I 've had some legendary moments , " chuckles Andrews , sitting in his dressing room one recent evening . <p> It 's the kind of flop-sweat terror every Broadway actor knows . But Andrews is not just any Broadway actor . He 's a cast member of " The Phantom of the Opera " , a musical that is less than a day away from setting a record as the longest-running production in Broadway history . After a special gala performance on Monday , " Phantom " will have been performed 7,486 times , one more than " Cats " , which closed five years ago . ( " The Fantasticks , " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this derby because it was an off-Broadway show , which means it ran in a theater with fewer than 500 seats . ) <p> Here 's the staggering part : Andrews has been in the show , continuously , since opening night . When " Cats " closed there was n't a single actor who 'd been in the production from the start . " Phantom " has three : Andrews , Richard Warren Pugh and Mary Leigh Stahl . Excluding vacation and sick leave , this trio has been rehashing the same story about the same half-masked freak in the same hokey extravaganza , eight times a week , for 18 straight years . <p> Imagine it . Eighteen years of Andrew Lloyd Webber 's NutraSweet score , a hybrid that suggests Puccini as rendered by A Flock of Seagulls . Plus numbingly sentimental lyrics , courtesy of Charles Hart and Richard Stilgoe . It 's the sort of punishment that the Geneva Conventions were supposed to ban , is n't it ? But the math does n't lie . Tally up the actual stage time , excluding rehearsals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24-hour days , more than two years of their respective lives , performing " Phantom " . <p> " People ask me if I get bored , " says Andrews , who seems the very opposite of aggrieved and rarely stops smiling . " That 's not really an issue for me . " <p> It 's not really an option , either . Andrews well remembers the hazards of zoning out . Like the time he forgot the words of a letter that his character , Monsieur Andre , is supposed to read - typically a cinch because the dialogue is helpfully printed right on the letter . But someone handed him the wrong letter - one read by a different character , later in the play - and pfffft , it was gone . As he gaped in silence , other actors tried to coax him with his first line . <p> " But I had nothing . Nothing ! So I just started saying out loud , I ca n't read this . I ca n't read this . ' " He figured the sound man would get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That took 30 agonizing seconds . <p> " It might have been longer , " says Andrews , shaking his head . " Thirty seconds to an actor is a long , long time . " <p> EVERYBODY knew " The Phantom of the Opera , " an adaptation of the novel by Gaston Leroux , would be a hit when it opened here in 1988 . The original , in London , was a phenomenon , and the show opened in Manhattan with a record $18 million in advance ticket sales . <p> Reviews were generally positive , and the production eventually won seven Tony Awards , including best musical . <p> But there are hits and there are Hits . With worldwide box office receipts of more than $3.2 billion , " Phantom " is now the highest-grossing entertainment venture in history - dwarfing the $1.8 billion earned by " Titanic " . According to the show 's public relations office , more than 80 million people around the world have seen " Phantom " , either in one of the six permanent productions scattered from Budapest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years been crisscrossing the country . Another version is set to open at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas . <p> Why " Phantom " ? There are plenty of theories . <p> The movie version , released in 2004 , certainly helped . It was a total flop , but the advertising campaign used the same imagery and music . Like everything else on Broadway , the show took a beating after 9/11 crushed the tourism business . But " we just checked the grosses and 2005 will be our best year ever , " says Alan Wasser , who manages the production . <p> The producers have built their latest ad campaign , billed as " Remember Your First Time , " on the assumption that everyone on Earth has sat through it already , and probably more than once . <p> Hard-core Phans - as they call themselves - have been to the show dozens and sometimes hundreds of times and swamp chat rooms with minutiae and memories . One woman legally changed her name to Christine Daae , the show 's ingenue . Tony Scheinman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dollars " at various " Phantom " - related charity auctions over the years . One bought him a bit part , for one night , in the show . " I played a Carthaginian slave , " he said in an interview . " I wore a body suit , a fake leopard skin and sandals . A lot of fun . " <p> THE Majestic 's dressing room area feels surprisingly like a cabin on a submarine . Everything is packed in close , every inch of space is utilized and before a show , everyone is scurrying to do a job they seem to know by heart . You hear the tra-la-las of performers warming up . A voice on a loudspeaker booms a countdown to curtain time and occasionally the name of an actor . <p> " If you do n't sign in , they start calling your name on the PA , " Andrews said in his dressing room . " Then they 'll call your cell phone . That happens to me when I 'm at Starbucks . " <p> Andrews moved to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Broadway career in 1973 with " Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris . " For the past five years , he 's played Monsieur Andre , his third part over these past 18 years . It 's not top billing , but it 's up there . <p> Through both seniority and temperament , Andrews appears to be the unofficial mayor of backstage Phantomville , and its historian , too . More than a decade ago , it struck him that nobody was jotting down the names of the actors who pirouetted through the play and then moved on . So he started asking them for 8-by-10 head shots and there is now a gallery in the basement , an impromptu alumni hall . <p> " I think there are something like 260 pictures down there now , " Andrews says . <p> It 's one way to measure the scale of this show . There are others . According to the production office , come Monday , the " Phantom " at the Majestic will have been shot at 14,972 times . And if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to audience members since opening night , you 'd have 43,105 miles of paper , enough almost to circle the globe twice . <p> All of this to tell what could charitably be described as a very kitschy fairy tale for grown-ups . Still , it 's impossible to take your eyes off this spectacle . A chandelier swoops overhead at the end of Act 1 , landing on the stage , but falling in such a way that it looks as if it will brain the people in the best seats . The cast of 35 keeps busy - there are 230 costumes in the show , and 111 wigs . <p> For Mary Leigh Stahl and the other 18-year veterans of the show , " Phantom " has provided a lifestyle that is all but unheard of in the theater world . No audition anxiety , no hopscotching to different productions , no strutting in a Cleveland road show . <p> " I do n't think I 'd still be in New York if I had n't gotten " Phantom , " " Stahl said . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like I hit the lottery . " <p> A sense of gratitude , not to mention decorum , might explain why you wo n't hear a primal scream of restive anguish from Andrews , Pugh or Stahl . All three politely deflect every version of the question , Hey , is n't this gig driving you bonkers ? " It 's work , and this show has been amazing to me , " says Pugh , who has played four different parts during his tenure . <p> Pugh was honeymooning in Bermuda years ago , and piped over the loudspeakers at a restaurant came " Music of the Night . " " It was the first time I 'd been away from the show in a couple years , " he says . " I told the waiter , It 's a lovely song . But here 's $10 . Play something else . ' " 1 . TINA FINEBERG : ASSOCIATED PRESS , 2 . ASSOCIATED PRESS @x the mother cried every day . The father had signed the agreement one afternoon after drinking a whole carton of Guinness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game of cards and wrote out the agreement that said whoever won would take over the other 's property and added that it was a joke of course and not at all legal . And so the father signed it and then lost the game . Lugardson took the agreement to court and the judge was Lugardson 's crony and he ruled that the father had truly signed away all that he owned . His company . His homes . His cars . He gave the family a week to hand them over to Lugardson . The father said , " But it was a joke ! The agreement was hastily written on a receipt ! It was a joke ! " But the judge ignored him . The father fell to the floor and thrashed and wept . Later , he said to the mother , " I thought Lugardson was my friend , " and the mother told him to shut up . " Are you stupid ? How could he be your friend ? He has been waiting for a way to take over your fortune ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her in an untoward way , too , which was a lie , but the mother liked to burnish her stories . The stories she told herself now that she cried every day did not need burnishing , though , because they were true : stories of their old life when they lived in the flower-hugged house on Queens Drive , when all of Lagos worshipped them . Now , none of their friends came to their mice-filled flat where the landlord often removed their electricity meter . But the mother 's greatest shame was her hair . It was matted , with thick clumps of natural undergrowth because relaxers and weaves were now unaffordable . She had been the toast of Lagos with her long and straight perm , and now she always wore a head scarf , even when alone . The daughter , too , could no longer afford relaxers and so had cut her hair off , and watched in wonder as it grew back , soft and dense like wool , for she had never seen her natural hair . In their old life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been singed and straightened . Now it was vibrant and kinky and full . She did not comb it but lovingly untangled it every morning with her fingers . The son , who used to work with the father in the company and now spent his days lying around limp with depression , asked that she cover her ugly hair with a scarf . The daughter was close to the son , had done most of his school assignments while he went to the clubs , and she could not understand his calling her hair ugly when it was the only beautiful thing they had left . Just like it was cheap gin that now kept the father going ( sometimes he even drank his old bottles of cologne because he said they had alcohol in them ) , it was her hair , untangling and twisting and glorying in it , that kept her from thinking too much of her constant hunger . She wished that she could reverse their fortune ; it was possible only if they could get the agreement itself and take it to a judge who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew how difficult life had become for them and he wanted to offer one of the children a job ; it was the least he could do . Lugardson was a wily man , with a thin mind and thin arms . His benevolence was disgusting . But the father accepted and said the son would take the job . The daughter knew that the father did not even think of considering her ; he did not know that she had often done the son 's school assignments in the old days . The son started work and came home to say that he was a mere messenger ; he stayed downstairs at the reception and was called only to run errands . But at least he earned a little money and they were able to eat better , although the mother took to vomiting because she could not believe she was now being given mere drops from a river that was rightly hers . An old friend stopped by with some loaves of bread one evening , this a man who used to kneel before the father to beg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the club that he kept the agreement in his office to remind himself of the father 's stupidity . The mother told the son that he had to find a way to get the agreement . The son tried different things , the daughter gave him ideas on how to fake his way into the office , but none worked . The son came home in tears . The father sank into deeper depression and began to talk of drinking his urine . The mother cried no longer once but twice a day . Months passed , and then on one hazy day the daughter was untangling her hair , which was now high enough to be held up in a puff like a large rabbit 's tail , when she heard the voice . It came from her hair . It was her hair . A voice that sounded like her late grandmother but was somewhat perkier . The agreement is in Lugardson 's air conditioner . The daughter shook her head . Then the voice came again . She knew then that there was something magical about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the mere softness and novelty of it . But knowing it was in his air conditioner was not enough . She needed to know more . And so she began , every morning , to wake up and untangle her hair and wait for the voice . Soon , the voice had told her all that she needed . The agreement was in the air conditioner in his office , stuffed into one of the vents , the place he thought most unlikely for anyone to look . She had to go and get it the next day , at exactly a quarter past noon , and she must stay no longer than 15 minutes in the office or she would be caught . The daughter set out for Lugardson 's office . She got to the gate and lost her nerve . They would never let her in . She was turning back when the voice from her hair told her to walk through , that the gate was open , and she would not be seen . So she did . She walked past the reception and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office was empty and smelled oddly of mothballs , and she went right to the air conditioner , stuck her hand into it and pulled an envelope out . Inside was the agreement . Then she heard footsteps ; Lugardson was coming . She stared at the door in panic and then began to run her fingers through her hair . Get under the desk . The carpeting was particularly soft under the desk and she settled down and hoped Lugardson would not stay long . He had come in with somebody and was laughing . She checked her watch . Five minutes had passed . Then eight . Lugardson was still talking . Then 11 minutes . She began to sweat . She pushed the envelope into her bra . The person with Lugardson left and Lugardson moved around the office for a while , and his cell phone rang and he answered it and left the office . Thirteen minutes had passed . The daughter flew out from under the desk and began to run as fast as she could , down the stairs , out through the gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus stop . The father looked at her in shock when she told her story , but it was the mother who took the agreement and held it reverently and then pulled off her scarf and touched her own hair in wonder . The next day they took it to Judge Rotimi , known for being incorruptible , and he ruled that Lugardson give back all he had taken from the father . In addition , Lugardson was to be tried for his crimes . The mother laughed and cried and danced and talked about how she would show pepper to all those nasty people who had deserted her . The father spoke of ordering cases of champagne . The son , still dazed , suggested they order whisky , too . The daughter watched with joyful amusement , all the time running her fingers through her hair . And they all lived happily ever after .
